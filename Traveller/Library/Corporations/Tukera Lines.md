### Tukera Lines
Tukera is the premier Imperial shipping corporation. In some areas
it has a virtual monopoly on large–scale freighting and passenger
travel. Tukera's assets range from huge bulk freighters and
impressive liners to specialized fast couriers and mid–sized mail
ships.

The firm's revenue mostly comes from regular, dependable routes
rather than speculative trade. Where Sharurshid has ships to enable
it to trade, Tukera's vessels are the main source of its prosperity.
Tukera protects its assets, personnel and interests quite aggressively.
Most ships are armed and carry a well–trained security detail.
Tukera also operates a number of starports or sections of larger
ports, and in many areas uses these assets to ensure preferential
treatment for its own vessels and those of its associated companies.
Of course, non–Tukera vessels are also permitted to use these
ports, though they always come second to Tukera assets. Despite
this, Tukera–owned ports are popular with starfarers for their good
service and safe environment.

The earliest record of Tukera Lines dates from the Sylean Federation
but the firm claims to be several centuries older, with a founding
date sometime during the Rule of Man.


Tukera Lines is a shipping operator, concerned mainly with major trade routes. It has offices on most worlds with a good port and large facilities where trade routes meet. Tukera operates a larger proportion of jump-3 and jump-4 capable vessels than most other shipping firms and has a useful sideline in getting information and people to the right place, fast. Its fast-courier network supplements the Imperial x-boat system but is made available only to those clients favored by the megacorporation. Tukera openly supports the Duke of Atsah in his bid to become Duke of Deneb.
