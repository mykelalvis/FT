Every system in the [[Sword Worlds]] subsector lies on the [[Spinward Main]], although getting to some without a jump-2 capable ship requires meandering for some time. The main diverges at [[Iron]] and again at [[Caliburn]], and heading spinward-rimward from there is a section of the main referred to as the [[Bowman Arm]], which runs across the coreward ends of [[District 268]] and the [[Five Sisters Subsector|Five Sisters]] before wandering out of the sector at [[Garoo]] and [[Uniqua]]. Rimward from [[Caliburn]], the main splits again in [[District 268]], giving access to the rimward end of the [[Five Sisters Subsector|Five Sisters]] in one direction and [[Glisten Subsector|Glisten]] in the other.  Jump-2 ships can make a circuit back towards [[Trin's Veil Subsector|Trin]] and [[Mora Subsector|Mora]] by this route. Spinward-coreward from Iron is an arm of the main that leads to [[Darrian Subsector|Darrian]] but is not normally considered part of the [[Spinward Main]] except in purely astrographical terms, due to the political allegiance of the worlds on the Main.

The [[Sword Worlds Confederation]], occupying a section of the [[Spinward Main]] and a couple of spurs from it, is a collection of like-minded world governments who sometimes work together, rather than a monolithic political body. The present Confederation capital is at [[Gram]], although exactly how much power is exerted from there can vary considerably depending on the political climate.

The [[Sword Worlds]] were settled by a long-range colony mission from [[Terra]]; the [[Imperium]] arrived much later and, as a result, there are deep cultural differences between the two. Similarly, the Darrians were recovering from the _Maghiz_ when the Sword Worlders claimed the region for their own. They thus see themselves as rightful overlords of the region and tend to deal with foreign ([[Darrians]] or [[Imperial]]) ships passing through in a high-handed and arrogant manner.

The four Metal Worlds ([[Iron]], [[Bronze]], [[Mithril]] and [[Steel]]) are 'reserve worlds' held in trust by the [[Sword Worlds Confederation]] against future need. Until recently, the Confederation has vigorously resisted [[Imperial]] efforts to exploit these worlds but that attitude has recently changed. A theoretically joint project to develop [[Steel]] has been put forward although, in practice, Sword World involvement is half-hearted at best. Surveying is likely to begin soon, once the last political issues are resolved.

There are only four Imperial worlds in the subsector: [[Flammarion]], [[Caladbolg]], [[Gunn]] and [[Caliburn]]. [[Flammarion]] has a small [[Imperial Navy]] station and both [[Flammarion]] and [[Caladbolg]] have [[IISS|scout]] bases to serve the [[x-boat]] route through to the [[Five Sisters Subsector|Five Sisters]]. There is also a small scout base at [[Biter]] serving the same purpose. [[Biter]] is part of the [[Sword Worlds Confederation]] and keeping the scout base in operation has, at times, required careful negotiation.

Were [[Steel]] to be developed, it might be possible to run the Imperial [[x-boat]] service through there, enabling the scout station at [[Biter]] to be closed. This appears to have been a factor in permitting the Steel Project to go ahead.
