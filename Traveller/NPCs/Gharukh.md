Gharukh is a brilliant Vargr cryptographer recruited by [[Tukera|Tukera Lines]] to head a business communication project. Originally affiliated with a corsair band, the [[Uekuez]], she was drawn away by the promise of high pay, unlimited resources, and the ability to learn Imperial coding technology. She is almost the classical caricature of a scientist, interested in her work to the near exclusion of all else. Because of her work's secret nature, there is little public recognition (very important to a [[Vargr]]), and she will greatly appreciate any accolade which her contributions to the field might earn. She currently has two other motivations worth noting: now considered a security risk, she is kept a virtual prisoner at Tukera's facility on Lewis and is searching for a way out; she also retains loyalties to the [[Uekuez]], and would seek revenge if she were aware that they had been the object of a particularly bloody (and successful) takeover attempt by the [[Kforuzeng]].
