# Diversification Inc

Diversification, Incorporated is more commonly known as DiCorp, and is exactly what the name suggests. It is a business group with interests in everything from shipbuilding to art galleries. DiCorp was formed by the merging of several smaller corporations and – unusually - has retained virtually all the businesses it started with.  Most merged business groups find a market sector and concentrate on it, but there seems to be little pattern to the operations of DiCorp other than the fact that it will concern itself with nothing that does not make money.

Most of the firms acquired or merged into DiCorp were at least modestly successful, and so long as they remain so the corporation seems to be content. An asset that ceases to be profitable is fixed or sold off, but even here there seems to be a habit of giving failing businesses a fair chance to turn around. Whilst inefficient in terms of maximising profits, this huge diversification has permitted DiCorp to ride out several catastrophic market events, as at least some of its interests tend to remain healthy during a slump. The firm’s executives do not give much away but do have an openly stated policy of being ‘in it for the long haul’.

DiCorp has assets on many worlds, usually but not always at the starport. Its holdings are sometimes directly associated with starships and interstellar trade; sometimes they are almost entirely unconnected. Travellers are as likely to spot the DiCorp logo on a bar wall or the equipment of a datanet security firm as on a trade ship or maintenance robot.

The many and various businesses owned by DiCorp rely on good interstellar communications for their continued success. The firm does operate a handful of starships, and it has a ship repair yard, but for the most part it charters vessels or puts cargo into the normal freight marketplace to be transported. This is the commonest way that small-ship operators interact with DiCorp, but occasionally some complex project comes to fruition and several ships converge at a single port. The logistics behind sending goods and personnel from many different businesses across several market sectors all to the same place at the same time are nightmarish, but DiCorp seems capable of doing it reliably.

At this point, DiCorp starts to make sense. It can provide a client with anything and everything the client needs, all operated or built by related firms with the same standards and protocols. Machinery, robots, vehicles, kitchen appliances and art objects all somehow fit together in a functionally and aesthetically coherent whole. A number of influential personalities (planetary rulers, entertainers, scholars and others) have spent vast sums on outfitting their home, business premises or even a small town with goods from DiCorp. The end result is a seamlessly integrated, coherent whole that can be vibrant and attention-grabbing or functional to the point of being essentially invisible.

Even when not engaged in an ambitious project like this, DiCorp has a good reputation for producing quality goods and delivering an excellent service, and their ‘Of course!’ marketing slogan is well-known. This translates to “Yes, we can do that for you. Yes, we can make that for you. Yes, we can meet that need. Now, what is it you were wanting?” Delivering on this promise means that DiCorp often has to pull together many different threads, and reliable outsiders are often brought in to help. Working with Diversification, Incorporated is demanding and complicated... but always interesting.
