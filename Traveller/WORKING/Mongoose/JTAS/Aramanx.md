### ARAMANX

Aramanx is a balkanised world at the edge of the Towers Cluster of the Aramis subsector. Its population of two billion is divided among eight major (and at least 20 minor) mutually hostile nations. Aramanx has become known as a the 'powder keg of the Towers Cluster', with clashes becoming increasingly common in recent years.

Recent efforts to reduce tensions have been at least partially successful and some states have pulled back from the brink of outright war. A state of watchful tension exists in many areas, with occasional punitive raids and border clashes, which are quickly brought under control. It seems that most states want to avoid the all-out global conflict that seems to be the inevitable result if the powder keg ignites.
