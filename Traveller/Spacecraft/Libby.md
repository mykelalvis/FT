Libby

Libby is a refurbished Azhanti High Lightning-class cruiser permanently assigned to the Reference scout base. She has been modified for use by the scouts; the fighter wing, launch tubes and recovery deck have been replaced by docking spaces for eight Type-S scout/couriers and two full hangars where they are serviced. The armories have been replaced with laboratories, libraries and a mail distribution array.

*The ship's Intellect program is a TL15 prototype that approaches the
functionality of a Conscious Intelligence. It answers to the name 'Libby'
and may be treated as a computer-bound NPC with INT 13 and EDU
13, with a range of skills that can be uploaded, changed and improved (typically in the skill level 2–4 range).
