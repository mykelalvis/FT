Welcome to the Small Craft Catalogue, featuring a vessel for your every need!

Small craft, those vessels of less than 100 tons and without a jump drive, are the workhorses of Traveller and
essential to the smooth running of every technological civilisation in Charted Space. This book gives you more
than 60 new small craft, to be used by Travellers, pirates, traders, government forces and corporations. Each
has a specific role and has been built to accomplish it with the best components available to its builders.

In this book you will find:

Modules: It is not just the Modular Cutter that can carry the 30-ton standard module, and there are many
configurations that greatly expand the operational capacity of these crafts.

Commercial Craft: Whether they are hauling cargo or passengers, there is a variety of small craft linking the
worlds of each star system, binding colonies and outposts together.

Working Craft: From the highport to the far reaches of the outsystem, these small craft keep the empires
running, fixing, rescuing, mining, and performing a multitude of other tasks.

Fighters: The most famous of small craft, high performance fighters are at the forefront of any outbreak of
hostilities, their pilots destined to become heroes – or to meet an untimely death in the void.

The Military: Between the fighter and the warship, there are many small craft that keep military forces in
the field and capable of acting effectively, from armoured transports and recon craft to assault boats and
system defence forces.

Luxury Craft: Owned by nobles and rich corporate executives, these small craft spare no expense at providing
the comfiest rides – and making sure everyone else knows it.

Aslan, Sword Worlds, Vargr and Zhodani: Beyond the Third Imperium and its affiliated states, other empires
can have very different takes on small craft design, but these vessels might just be the perfect in-system ride
for a group of Travellers.

Plus new rules on how your Travellers can use small craft to their best effect and bring another dimension
to their adventures.

# I NTRODUCTION

Small craft are defined as sub-100 ton vessels that,
by virtue of their small size, are incapable of entering
jumpspace. They are therefore restricted to a single
star system unless carried on board a starship.
However, they fulfil a galaxy’s worth of roles and both
commercial and military operations in civilised space
would be quite impossible without them.

From shuttles to tugs, from haulers to maintenance
craft, from assault boats to the glamorous fighters,
small craft are the unsung heroes, the workhorses
of Charted Space. While the big starships have to
dedicate a great portion of their interior hull space to
jump drives and fuel tanks, small craft are far more
efficient and, of course, cheaper. They are the only
choice to perform certain missions that would be at
best impractical for a starship.

Having a large selection of small craft is extremely
useful in a Traveller campaign. For the Travellers, it
means they can purchase and use small craft that
are tailored to their exact requirements, rather than
constantly trying to fit a square peg into a round hole
with the standard craft found in the Traveller Core
Rulebook or High Guard. Many of the craft found in this

book will fit neatly into existing hangars and docking
spaces on their spacecraft, meaning they will be able to
upgrade the scope and capabilities of their main vessel
simply by visiting a good shipyard.

For their part, the Referee now has access to a
multitude of small craft that can be inserted into
adventures as opponents, victims or background
colour. They will be able to describe the veritable
fleet of small craft all going about their tasks as the
Travellers arrive at a new highport – tugs pulling larger
ships into position, shuttles bringing visitors up from
the highport, a customs craft departing for its patrol,
utility pods performing maintenance on the highport’s
structure or manoeuvring cargo containers onto a
waiting superfreighter... what was once a routine
arrival is now packed full of details and, at some
point in their adventures, the Travellers will be able to
interact with all of these small craft.

This book gives you a vast array of small craft, over
60 of them in fact, divided into simple categories
covering commercial and military craft, passenger
carriers, cargo haulers, luxury vessels and the small
craft of alien empires.

# U SING SMALL CRAFT

Small craft often get overlooked by Travellers in
preference to large starships. However, there are
many ways a small craft can be used that a canny
Traveller can take advantage of. Small craft have the
benefit of being ubiquitous, and so can hide in plain
sight, and their physical size means careful positioning
can conceal their location completely on a rugged
moon or asteroid. They are also far less costly to run,
often much faster than a typical starship and if the
Travellers are operating in the same star system for
an extended period of time it might make a lot more
sense for them to use a small craft instead.

#### SMALL CRAFT BENEFITS

It is possible to gain a Ship’s Boat as a Benefit while
mustering out of a career, typically the Navy. Many
Travellers simply substitute this for a Ship Share,
thinking it more useful, but unless you are desperate to
pay down a mortgage on the group’s ship by an ever-so-slight amount, take a moment to reconsider.

To begin with, while this Benefit is listed as a
ship’s boat, the Referee may allow you to choose
something else. Any small craft with a maximum
value of MCr10 should be just fine.

The next potential issue is that small craft do not
have jump drives, so while the Traveller may be
moving between the stars, the craft will not be able
to. There are two options here:

- The small craft could be shipped as freight.
    This is common enough but requires larger or
    more specialised starships to carry something
    this large that cannot be broken down into
    lots, in the way that an equivalent tonnage of
    shipping containers can. Use the Passage and
    Freight table on page 239 of the Traveller Core
    Rulebook to find the per ton cost of freighting
    your small craft and then double it.
- The small craft can be put into long-term
    storage. Any Class C or better starport is likely
    to have some facility to do this, whether it is an
    underground hangar, spare space in a shipyard,
    an area outside the highport designated for ship
    ‘parking’, or under a tarpaulin in a field outside
    the downport. Here the craft will stay, watched by
    starport security, for a monthly fee. This charge
    will vary between starports but Cr10–100 per ton
    would be reasonable, depending on facilities in the
    starport and how busy it is.



The cheap solution is to store the small craft until the
Traveller returns to the system but it is worth considering
the freight option. If the Travellers have no starship of
their own, having a small craft gives them immense
freedom in a new star system and potentially more
speed and flexibility than they would have with a large
ship. Storage might be a better idea if the Travellers
have a definite plan to obtain a larger starship of their
own with decent hangar space for the small craft.

#### REVISED FUEL OPERATION TIMES

The small craft detailed in the Traveller Core Rulebook
and High Guard use the ship construction rule of a
minimum of one ton needed for power plants and this is
enough to run a spacecraft for the standard four weeks
of operation. However, it makes sense for small craft to
be able to use less than a ton of fuel for their tiny power
plants and this is what the Small Craft Catalogue does
to alter the operational characteristics of each craft.

### Using Small Craft

The same can be done for small craft in the Traveller
Core Rulebook and High Guard, using the Operation
Times table.

For each small craft, you are provided with three
options. The easiest is to keep fuel tonnage at its
original amount (one ton) and simply extend the
operation time (as marked in the Endurance column)
to match, which will result in very high endurance
craft. Alternatively, you can use the Cargo column and
assume that each craft has four weeks’ operational
time and instead receives an increase in cargo space.
As a further option, you can assume a two week
operational time and increase cargo space further.

Note that these increases should be decided when
a craft is first purchased or built, and regarded as
permanent – they are not ‘configurable’.

Ultralight Fighter 40 weeks +0.9 tons +0.95 tons
Light Fighter 40 weeks +0.9 tons +0.95 tons

Torpedo Boat 9 weeks +0.56 tons +0.78 tons
Shuttle 13 weeks +0.7 tons +0.85 tons
Passenger Shuttle 13 weeks +0.7 tons +0.85 tons

Made famous by the modular cutter, standard modules
can be quickly fitted to any compatible vessel (typically
small craft but see Adventure Class Ships for an
exception), allowing them to be configured for different
mission roles on the fly. Shipyards quickly realised that
designing, building and marketing a new module is a
lot cheaper than doing the same for a new ship, and so
the variety of modules available exploded.

The most common modules (generally regarded as
cargo transport, personnel transport, vehicle cradle,
fuel skimmer, assault boat, fighter frame, pressurised
shelter and gunship modules) can all be found in High
Guard. Presented in this chapter are several less well-known, yet crucial for their owners, modules that are
compatible with the standard fittings and attachments.

### MODULES

CATTLE TRANSPORT MODULE


Capable of transporting a score of cattle
inexpensively between worlds, this module features
two cargo bays placed at either end with the stable
between them – one is intended to store what goes
into the cattle, the other what comes out of them. A
stateroom is included for the use of a carer to watch
over the cattle during transit. Some owners will
use the module as a semi-permanent stable for an
outpost but, unless the atmosphere is breathable and
the animals are allowed to wander during the day,
this will result in some very unhappy cattle.

**ARMOURY MODULE**
A ‘drop-and-leave’ module, this mobile armoury is
capable of supplying weapons and ammunition to an
entire company. Typically dropped at small outposts
located in hostile territory to provide all the defensive
needs the inhabitants could wish for, the armoury
module is also sometimes used by mercenary and
paramilitary forces as a forward supply dump or
weapon cache to keep troops supplied and fighting
in mobile infantry warfare. Space is included for
distributing and equipping troops.

COLD PASSAGE MODULE


Also called the frozen module or refrigerated module,
this is sometimes seen as a very cynical addition to
a craft that tries to pack in the maximum number of
fee-paying passengers as possible. Manufacturers,
however, are keen to point out that it also makes for
a superb emergency lifeboat for overfull passenger
ships. These modules have also been known to be
used for prisoner transport.

**FIGHTER HANGAR MODULE**
Providing a more long-term protection solution when
compared to the more common fighter frame module,
this carries two light fighters with a standard stateroom
for both of the pilots. While carrying more capable
fighters (although notably less of them) and extended
crew facilities for longer voyages, the docking spaces
used to accommodate the larger fighters take time to
load and unload, meaning response times can be cut
drastically in the event of attack.

### MODULES

LIFE SUPPORT MODULE


Designed as a temporary measure, life support
modules can be found running in small outposts
years after they were first deployed. Containing a
thriving biosphere, this module is capable of providing
life support to nearly 50 people for five months. All
that is required is a connection to an outpost in an
unbreathable atmosphere and someone skilled in plant
care. Given a supply of hydrogen fuel as well, there is
no reason this module cannot run indefinitely, providing
not only life support but food as well.

**FRONTIER MEDICAL MODULE**
A literal life-saving module for settlements beyond
the borders of empires, a craft equipped with one
of these can act as an emergency medical centre

- capable of surgeries – on worlds that would
otherwise lack them. The frontier medical modules
can also be found working in disaster areas and
warzones, providing quality medical care that may
only be bettered by an advanced hospital.

**MISSILE SUPPORT MODULE**
Little more than a targeting suite, turret, missile rack,
all backed up by a very large missile magazine,
this module gives the small craft carrying it very
long ranged and sustained fire support capabilities.
Whether in space or planetside, the missile support
module allows its craft to circle well behind a frontline,
launching a near continuous stream of missiles at
targets picked up by its own sensors or designated
by forward observers. Very popular among smaller
mercenary companies, this module allows even
support craft to participate in combat. No software
is pre-loaded onto the computer but it is capable of
running Launch Solution/1 for MCr10.

### MODULES

ORBITAL OUTPOST MODULE


Intended to be flown to orbit by a cutter or other
craft and then released, the orbital outpost module
is a very cheap way for small corporations or even
individuals to gain a foothold into space. Although
limited in capability, the module comes with its own
airlock to the cargo bay, enough room in that cargo
bay for two air/rafts and a station-keeping manoeuvre
drive. It even features a small turret, although no
weapons are fitted as standard.

PASSENGER MODULE


A logical extension of the personnel transport
module, this version sports full staterooms that allow
passengers to endure far larger journeys. Typically
found in systems that have outposts and settlements
strung across both inner and outer planets, passengers
are reported to feel like they are being carted about
in a tin can despite the facilities onboard being near-identical to that of a starliner.

**PLANETARY ASSAULT MODULE**
With a reputation as a death trap for those on board,
the planetary assault module nevertheless provides an
inexpensive means for mercenaries and paramilitary
units to launch lightning-fast planetside attacks on
important objectives. Capable of carrying three squads
in some discomfort, alongside their weaponry and
any specialist equipment, this module should only be
used in uncontested orbital space as it is extremely
vulnerable to counterattacks.

### MODULES

PLANETARY OUTPOST MODULE


Intended to be used in conjunction with several
other modules delivered by a small fleet of cutters,
the planetary outpost module provides living space
for a couple of families or several workers. When
deployed in conjunction with the likes of the power,
frontier medical, life support, urban and even public
house modules, a complete small settlement can
be created in little more than a day and, suitably
provisioned, could last for years.

POWER MODULE


Conceived as a simple module that can be landed and
left in place at remote outposts, it is little more than
a large fusion power plant with enough fuel to keep
it running for more than eight months before it needs
topping up. In a pinch, the power module can be used
as a backup system for a ship but it is rugged enough
to be a reliable power source for a science station,
military base or small settlement that would otherwise
be cut off from technology. This module can also be
built at TL6 with a fission-based power plant – this will
cost MCr8.9 and provide Power 160.

**PUBLIC HOUSE MODULE**
A complete business in a module, this is effectively
a mobile public house (pub) that can be dropped
onto any location, brew its own beers and provide
a suitable drinking venue for patrons to consume
them. While comfy and atmospheric seating is
provided inside the module, on worlds with breathable
atmospheres and fine weather, the main hatch will be
left open and temporary tables with seating placed
outside to encourage greater numbers of drinkers.
Occasionally, a module like this will be dropped and
simply left at smaller and less advanced settlements
to function as its main social point.

RELAXATION MODULE


Also known as the chill-out module or vibing module,
this design is based on some very simple ideas that
have proven extremely popular among a certain
breed of Traveller. A well-stocked biosphere is kept
functioning to capacity, conveniently located next to a
somewhat specialised laboratory where visitors can...
experiment. Other fittings are provided to make for a
positively de-stressing environment.

### MODULES

SALVAGE MODULE


Intended to provide a small but functional repair and
salvage bay, this module can be used planetside or
in vacuum. Two grappling arms fold into the module
walls when not in use but extend to grasp items in
zero-G environments and pull them into the bay,
where a fully equipped workshop provides the facilities
to dismantle or repair as needed.

**SPACEBORNE EARLY WARNING MODULE**
Typically found installed in the craft of small planetary
navies and mercenary units, the spaceborne early
warning module is packed with sensors and processing
equipment, along with room for a small crew to
monitor and analyse information and relay it to other
units. Equally capable of acting as a survey platform,
electronics warfare centre or mobile command and
control base, this module functions well in both a space
and atmospheric environment.

TANKER MODULE


A development of the more common fuel skimmer
module, the tanker module gives up fuel capacity to
install a fuel processor and a small power plant to run
it. While this does, of course, mean the module carries
less fuel, it is able to refine the fuel while it travels
back to its parent vessel, which can make the entire
refuelling process much more efficient under the right
circumstances. It also means the parent vessel does
not need to carry fuel processing equipment of its
own, thus freeing up space.

### MODULES

URBAN MODULE


Intended to be kept on board the carrying craft which
would be stationed at a starport or on the outskirts of
a settlement, the urban module provides a quick and
easy facility for ground-based transport. The bulk of
its interior is taken up with a hangar large enough to
accommodate two ground cars and an array of bikes,
along with a workshop for any needed repairs and
enough fuel to keep a fleet of typical ground vehicles
moving without having to rely on local services.

Sold to single owner-operators and families, the
civilian hopper is a general-purpose utility vehicle
intended to travel between worlds performing
roles in both business and pleasure. In a way, it
is very similar to small, low-tech ground-based

trucks, where price is the absolute selling point.
Extremely functional, the hopper is nevertheless
reliable, easy to service and highly adaptable to
whatever task it is put to.

An attempt to commercialise open space, this
small craft uses a holographic hull to blast brightly
coloured advertising messages to passing visitors
and passenger vessels that have viewports.
Flitting slowly around highports and public space
stations on barely legal flight plans, much to the
consternation of traffic control, the only purpose of
this craft is to advertise the services and products

available after ships have docked. Any business
within the highport can purchase ‘screen time’ on
the side of the advertising boat and despite the
sometimes perceived crassness of this approach,
it can be a popular one. Cabin space on board is
sometimes used to give potential advertising clients
a pleasure trip around the highport to demonstrate
the value of this craft and its services.

There is never a shortage of requirements
for cheap transport craft capable of moving
reasonable-sized cargoes across star systems at
a decent speed. This cargo shuttle is very typical
of the smaller craft that are built for the role and,
at any given time, dozens or even hundreds

might be moving between outposts and worlds
in a developed star system. They are owned by
a huge range of interests, from governments
and large corporations to smaller independent

Ostensibly an ordinary pinnace constructed to
transport cargoes across the inner worlds of a star
system, this craft has a few surprises built into it of
interest to less reputable traders. Most used is the
concealed cargo space that, while small, can carry
high-value goods of less than full legality. While

this space is not guaranteed to escape notice by
customs agents, the recessed high burn thruster
is fully capable of outrunning most customs patrol
craft, although its use will bring immediate suspicion
and likely pursuit. Excuses that the thruster is
installed to escape pirates usually fall on deaf ears.

is spaceflight done cheaply. It is typical of the
commercial craft that appear once a civilisation
discovers grav and manoeuvre drive technology,
however its type remains in service across

Charted Space due to its inexpensive design.
Purchase and running costs are so low that it is
not unusual to see orbital return tickets offered
for less than Cr50, or simply given free as part of
an interstellar middle passage ticket.

Dedicated to passenger transport, the fast shuttle
is intended to provide a workable solution for
longer distance travel across a star system. Even
when manoeuvre drives become practical, slow
commercial craft can take several days to travel

from planet-to-planet, and journeying to a moon
of a distant gas giant can mean travel upwards of
a week. The fast shuttle has sufficient speed to
cut journey times significantly.

An early design of shuttle, this craft is intended to
kickstart trade between a mainworld and the first
colonies and outposts it sets up in its own star
system. Due to the expense and technological
base needed to manufacturea (somewhat) efficient
manoeuvre drive, trade shuttles are typically owned

by governments and large corporations, with other
organisations still having to rely on much shorter-ranged reaction drive craft. The appearance of
trade shuttles is a sure sign that a civilisation is
about to make the leap to interstellar travel.

The standard passenger shuttle was designed to
take as many people as possible on short journeys,
typically from surface to orbit. The extended range
variant does away with the small acceleration seats
and instead has dedicated cabin space and seating

more akin to airliners on pre-grav atmospheric
worlds, as well as more powerful engines to shorten
flight times. This allows for greatly extended flight
times and increased comfort on shorter trips.

is intended to safely deliver untrained crew and
passengers from a stricken ship to the nearest
space station or inhabitable planetary body. Without
even a bridge, the automated lifeboat is piloted
entirely by a virtual crew software suite, although it
can also be remotely controlled at short ranges by

the vessel it is launched from. This is sometimes
done to guide it through a hazardous area, such as
a debris field around the stricken ship. Normally, the
automated lifeboat can carry 16 people to safety,
although the acceleration benches can be swapped
out for eight low berths for a cost of MCr0.36

While utility pods and larger craft move cargo
containers from ship-to-ship and ship-to-port, it is
the smaller freight handler pods that manoeuvre
those containers into position to be transferred
and sometimes fill those containers in the void.
This is accomplished with the use of a grappling

arm. These pods are usually seen, often in
large numbers, at most highports and busy
orbital transfer stations. Freight handling duty is
a route for young pilots looking to break into a
commercial pilot career.

* Despite being rated at Thrust 6, this craft is limited to Thrust 1 performance
at all times. The larger manoeuvre drive allows it to maintain this performance
while carrying additional containers or other craft in is docking clamps.

The transporter and the many variations of its ilk are
such a ubiquitous sight around busy highports and
space stations that they become all but invisible.
Little more than a 10-ton pod fitted with two docking
clamps, these tiny craft scoot between ships and
moons (and to planetary surfaces, for the daring

pilots) carrying one or two standard-size cargo
containers – although they are capable of carrying
another small craft of up to 30 tons in a pinch. It
should be noted that the only concession to pilot
comfort is a small area of cabin space designed for
sleep during longer ferrying trips.

An attempt to give any starship with a small

belter launch is cheap and functional but potentially
the source of great riches – at least, that is what
the advertising for it says. In practice, it is cramped,
unable to recover a large amount of ore without

returning to its parent ship regularly, and it has
a reputation for ending up really dirty inside
with rock dust leaking from the hold to the living
spaces. The interior lights dimming whenever the
laser drill is fired does not endear it to its owners.

among its crews that any real resistance will force

a retreat but this craft can provide a credible

otherwise take advantage of poor law enforcement
and push their luck in quieter systems.

One of the most common auxiliary small craft found
on board starships is the 20-ton launch, useful for
its small size, cheap price tag and general utility.
They are often assumed to be ‘lifeboats’ on some
ships, a means of transit for crew and passengers
away from a stricken vessel. However, unless

a ship is being abandoned in civilised space,
there is a definite time limit for survivability on a
standard launch. This lifeboat is based on the hull

A simple and cheap design, the medical launch
is nevertheless a literal life-saver. In typical use,
it will fly to a space station or planet’s surface to
evacuate casualties and keep them stable while

returning to a dedicated hospital ship. At need, it
can operate as a medical centre in disaster zones
but its capacity is woefully likely to be completely
overwhelmed, rendering it almost useless.

Built specifically to respond to space-based
emergencies, the rescue boat is a high-thrust craft
that can reach areas of disaster quickly. Once there,
its shielded and armoured hull protects it from
debris, secondary explosions and radiation hazards

while its scanners search for casualties. The rescue
team on board can then leave the boat in vacc
suits, locate and retrieve anyone still alive, and
provide emergency medical aid while the rescue
boat speeds back to its parent ship or station.

The versatility of the modular cutter has led to its
implementation across Charted Space. It was,
perhaps, inevitable that some shipyards would
see this success and attempt to build something
smaller and cheaper that could, in theory, do the
same job. The modular skiff was the result, born
from the idea that so long as a craft could carry a

standard 30-ton module, it would be the module
itself that defined its role and the craft would be
little more than a manoeuvre drive and power
plant for it. Regarded as a poor man’s cutter, the
modular skiff has found some markets but its
crew are rarely a happy bunch.

Commonly found clamped to the spoke of a well-funded Type-L laboratory ship, the research pinnace
greatly expands the reach and capabilities of the
researchers and scientists on board. Equipped with
its own laboratory, this craft allows for long-reaching

field missions across a star system with the
laboratory ship itself acting as a base of operations
and research centre. The ability to land on planets
adds massively to scientific voyages, making this
craft a popular upgrade to the Type-L.

This small craft fulfils a need for customs agents to
physically inspect ship cargoes before they reach a
starport, either to relieve stress on an over-loaded
customs staff or because suspicion has been raised
over a recently jumped-in free trader. It is absolutely

not the role of the customs patrol boat to force
boardings or chase down pirates – there are larger
and better-equipped craft that can do that more
easily. However, as a cheap solution to the problem
of cargo inspections, it performs well.

Taking advantage of more advanced technologies,
the fast cutter squeezes greater performance
out of its hull above and beyond that of the more
common modular cutter. Completely compatible
with a staggering variety of standard 30-ton
modules, the fast cutter is able to operate in

slightly more dangerous systems due to the
difficulty of intercepting such a small and fast
target – realistically, under most circumstances,
only dedicated fighters are going to be capable of
launching a successful attack.

In commercially-led orbital space, there is always
a need to move relatively large quantities of cargo
between ships, or between a ship and a station.
Single containers can be moved by small pod-like craft but larger quantities need a dedicated

shuttle. This craft features its own retractable
grappling arm, allowing a competent crew to load
their own hold with standard containers if they
are left stationed in the void.

Packed full of sensor arrays, analysis suites and
state-of-the-art computers, the traffic control router
keeps station in a high orbit around a destination
planetary body, monitoring and directing space
traffic. In busy systems it will be designated
a rotating sector to control, with other router
craft handling their own areas, but around quiet

systems it might be solely responsible for all
space traffic control. Shifts aboard this craft are
not considered desirable and most starports will
rotate crew on a weekly or two-weekly basis. The
router is notable in that it relies on solar panels
for power, although it does have a chemical-based power plant for emergencies.

Less common than the ubiquitous modular cutter,
this heavier craft is able to carry and operate
two standard modules simultaneously. This not
only doubles the capabilities of the craft, such as
being able to gather twice the fuel on one fuel-skimming trip but also gives the option to expand

capabilities. For example, a heavy modular cutter
would be able to fly passengers from a contested
starport by carrying a passenger module
alongside a fighter frame module, allowing it to
launch fighters to deter any marauders.

As a world reaches technological adolescence and
begins to explore its solar system, the presence
of existing interstellar communities requires the
development of some form of planetary protection.
The mini-fighter is the result, a craft with limited
capabilities yet one that remains within reach of less

advanced worlds and those who can afford little
else. Its area of operations is limited to little more
than orbital space (and that requires an auxiliary
thruster to achieve) and it must be vectored onto
targets by ground stations.

intended to be deployed in numbers to overwhelm
ground forces planetside in support of army units.
Equally capable of engaging less advanced
armoured vehicles and hardened structures, this

fighter will leave infantry formations to the units
it is supporting. Launched from orbit, it can cut
defensive reaction times to just a few minutes,
adding to its survivability in the face of sustained
anti-fighter weaponry.

Once, long ago, the Moray was a common sight
throughout independent system defence forces,
particularly those affiliated with belters. Effective at
the time, these fighters have long since passed the
point of obsolescence and only the desperate try
to keep them flying. Some examples are centuries

old but if an impoverished world needs to maintain
some semblance of defence, an antique fighter
screen may, just possibly, be better than nothing.
However, it is a brave pilot that climbs into one of
these to do battle with an attacking enemy.

The product of a desperate scrapyard that urgently
needs to provide fighters, the junker is a cobbled-together mess of drive, power plant, weapon and
a place fora (very brave) pilot to sit. Pieces from
different spacecraft are, sometimes literally, welded
together with power lines and hydraulics strung
between them in an effort to build something

quickly and cheaply that will move under its own
power and, hopefully, be able to identify enemies
and fire something at them. The combat survival
rate of junkers is miserable but a last-ditch stand
by a large fleet of misshapen fighters is the very
stuff of dramatic vidshows.

Kashu multirole fighter is not an uncommon sight
in more advanced planetary navies and auxiliary
forces, although rarely in high numbers due to the
per unit cost. The reinforced hull and armour allow
it to engage ground targets with twin-linked plasma

weaponry, while retaining a deadly pulse laser for
space combat. Powerful drives push the Kashu
quicker than almost all of its contemporaries, while
an advanced sensor suite promises to alert the pilot
to danger before an attack is launched.

Hugely expensive, the Jester is used only on the
highest priority missions – in fact, its main drawback
is that it is almost too expensive to deploy. Able to
slip through defences all but unseen, this fighter is
often used as a first strike platform, either destroying

important targets outright or clearing anti-shipping
defences to pave the way for a larger fleet. The
Jester has proved extremely capable of destroying
surveillance satellites and drones before engaging
its high-burn thruster to retreat in haste.

Intended to be among the first craft spearheading an
attack, the Vanguard’s duty is to escort larger assault
craft and, to put it bluntly, provide a tough target to
distract incoming fire. This is an exceedingly risky
role to fulfil but the Vanguard is both manoeuvrable

enough and tough enough to evade and absorb
sustained attacks. Once the assault craft are able
to engage their targets, the Vanguard can then
provide a screen against enemy fighters.

A very small craft that depends primarily on speed
for its own safety, the space surveillance boat is
designed to be launched from a parent craft, close
in on a target and capture as much data as possible
on it in one pass. Mission complete, the boat then

returns to its ship to jump from the system. This can
be extremely dangerous work but its crews seem to
take a perverse pleasure in the risks and often refer
to themselves as among the best in the fleet.

Highly specialised, the carrier support craft is
launched alongside carrier-launched fighters and
one is typically on station whenever operations
are taking place. Built to recover disabled fighters
with a docking clamp and ejected crew via an

airlock, this craft can be another pilot’s best friend
in an emergency. A turret-mounted sandcaster is
installed with the idea that recovery operations
could take place under fire but, in practice, this
would be exceedingly dangerous.

Born for a requirement for a 20-ton launch capable
of operating in a military environment, not to
mention being shot at on occasion, the fast launch
trades cargo space for armour and speed. In most
other respects, it functions as any other 20-ton

launch although is notably more rugged. There is
no little demand for this version of the launch in
the military surplus market, as it is a more capable
craft and yet fits neatly into docking spaces
configured for the standard launch.

While the fast launch has always been looked
upon as a ‘militarised lifeboat’, the fighting launch
is an attempt to go further and turn this well-known
small craft into what might be best described as a
budget fighter. Intended for military applications,
the fighting launch has found better sales among

private operators, particularly those looking to
add a real layer of defence to its parent craft.
Fully capable of using docking spaces intended
for unarmed transports and lifeboats, the fighting
launch can give a corsair a nasty surprise when
launched from a small trader.

systems across Charted Space, the covert insertion
boat is a spy craft, plain and simple. Extremely
simple to build, its advanced stealth systems
allow it to move virtually unseen through even

advanced planetary defence networks. Its mission
roles vary widely but include landing important
personnel or covert strike teams on planets or

The Spaceborne Electronics Warfare boat is
designed to support small craft operations. Quick
enough to at least keep up with most fighters, it is
intended to hang back from the frontline of battle
and provide electronic warfare support to squadrons,
allowing them to concentrate on their own primary

roles. As such, it will be launched alongside fighters
on strike or carrier defence missions or other small
craft performing raids, such as assault boats. The
SEW boat has extremely advanced electronics but
has a massive price tag to match and is only in
service with the most well-funded navies.

A blisteringly fast craft, the strike boat is designed
to be launched from a warship and then speed to
engagement range to launch waves of missiles
before defenders can effectively intercept it. With
a canny commanding officer masterminding the

engagement, the sheer speed of the strike boat
can make it all but impossible to properly counter,
with defending forces typically using their own
missiles to drive it off temporarily before it returns
having out-ranged the attack.

A cunning component to a layered integrated
system defence, this small craft is constructed by
hollowing out a relatively small asteroid. Typically,
it is then placed in or around an asteroid belt where
it is then able to hide amongst countless other
floating rocks to give an invader a nasty surprise.

Particularly rich systems may double down on
this approach and apply a stealth coating to the
rock’s exterior, making this craft, to all intents and
purposes, invisible. Even if, by some chance, the
system defence rock is discovered before it opens
fire, it can prove to be exceptionally tough.

The boarding shuttle is launched from warships
to directly contact an enemy vessel and deliver a
boarding party to neutralise it. This is an extremely
dangerous mission and this shuttle is well-equipped to weather the short journey between
ships while under heavy fire. A small amount of
cargo space is included for any mission-specialist

equipment needed but the primary function of the
shuttle is getting fighting troops into an enemy
ship. Two platoons can be transported in this way
but it is more common for a single platoon to be
deployed instead to avoid bottlenecks on board
and in the breaching tube.

While military forces (both naval and ground-based) use cutters, pinnaces and ship’s boats to
deliver cargo, units operating in hostile territories
require something a lot tougher that can survive
a few knocks. Although not desirable, the cargo
transport can (in theory) land while under fire and

has modest weaponry to defend itself. However,
in practice, it will be well-escorted if an attack
is deemed likely. Troop transport versions also
exist, replacing 32 tons of the cargo space with
acceleration benches (carrying 128 personnel), a
conversion that costs an additional Cr80000.

Intended to be supported by fighters or a small
fleet of larger warships, the planetary assault barge
is intended to make a very short journey from a
carrier vessel to the upper atmospheric reaches of
a hostile world. Once in position, it will disgorge its

stock of assault capsules, dropping well-armed
marines directly to the planet’s surface before
defenders can make any reasonable response.
While cramped, a single barge can deploy a
decent-sized platoon in this fashion.

Supplementing full-size system defence boats,
this craft is intended as a brawler that can support
a defence fleet or engage much larger targets
than itself and deliver much more damage than it
receives. A lot of this capability comes down to its

thick armour but multiple systems and software
suites contribute to its ultimate effectiveness. If a
squadron of system defence craft are operating in a
system, pirates and corsairs should be wary.

Although lacking in the outright luxury fittings of
larger craft sold to wealthy individuals, what stands
the runabout apart is its expense (and speed)
to move so few people around a star system.
However, it does have practical value too, as it
is small enough to fit into any hangar and most

docking spaces, even if they were not designed
specifically for it, as well as being capable of
landing in almost any territory. This makes it a
perfect craft to move a small group around a star
system at speed, even if things can get a little
cramped at times.

Designed to carry a small number of diplomats
or other VIPs from one part of a star system
to another, this shuttle is extremely tough and
given many systems intended to cope with any
conceivable emergency, the absolute priority being

to deliver the passengers in one piece, whatever
the circumstances. In use, the protective shuttle
will usually be protected by a flight of other small
craft, usually fighters or gunboats.

An unusual craft that is popular with nobles who
live in tourist systems, this yacht is capable of all
the usual pleasure travelling expected by its owners
but adds one new dimension – with its pressurised
hull, it can extend tours into the atmospheres of gas

giants and, more commonly, the depths of planetary
oceans. Craft like these are often seen in the
skies and seas of advanced water worlds, but also
moons sporting liquid oceans other than water.

is more a rich noble’s toy as there are obviously
far cheaper (not to mention faster) ways of getting

their entourage taking a pleasure cruise, there are
few finer vessels for seeing planetary sights while
enjoying the majesty of the large solar sails.

A luxury pleasure craft, this shuttle is typically
owned and used by nobles and wealthy corporate
leaders for jaunts around a single system – it is
best viewed as a non-jump-capable yacht, with
fittings and facilities to match. Although possessing
decent performance to get the busy executive

where they need to be on time, it is intended to
provide a means of travel in absolute comfort
while marvelling at the sights a system has to
offer. As such, when not berthed at a starport, a
luxury shuttle can often be seen in close orbit of
interesting moons, planets and gas giants.

A forerunner of the larger and more advanced
Khuilrakh, the Yeawel is nevertheless still flying in
frontier regions of the Hierate and, given the skills
of its pilots, still respected by opposing navies.
Whereas it used to be a frontline combat craft, the

Yeawel is more commonly seen today on patrol,
escort and planetary defence duties than filling the
fighter bays of a carrier. Nonetheless, it is a foolish
crew that ignores a flight of these fighters.

The Khuilrakh (named after a small flying predator
found on Kusyu) is a standard Aslan fighter, direct
and unsophisticated, as demanded by its warrior
pilots. It is noted for being faster than its human
equivalents and capable of space and aerospace

operations alike. The Khuilrakh has gained a
reputation for being exceptionally tough and has
been responsible for more than one Aslan warrior
attaining great renown in the Hierate.

Officially designated as a reconnaissance pinnace,
the presence of weapons, heavy armour and
troops tends to suggest that the Aslan have
something else in mind for the roles the Yaeai
will undertake. In practice, this craft does indeed


perform armed reconnaissance missions but
Aslan warriors very much actively look for targets
of opportunity, a function the Yaeai is well-equipped to take advantage of.

On occasion, a clan will build a dedicated shrine
ship, a craft where visiting Aslan can pause and
consider the actions of their ancestors. The large
Shrine of Heroes on this ship will be replete with
statues of renowned ancestors, art of their great
deeds and demonstrations of how their actions


resonate through the clan today. Shrine ships are
considered deeply sacred to the Aslan and the
desecration – or, worse, destruction – of one is a
guaranteed way to bring many warbands of Aslan
warriors, ihatei and otherwise, down upon you.

Never ones to dismiss a good design, regardless
of where it came from, the Sword Worlders’ version
of the ship’s boat is very similar to those found
in the Imperium but it is a little less sophisticated
and somewhat more rugged. Otherwise, the
capabilities are very similar, although Sword


Worlders will point out that theirs is faster, carries
more people and cargo (while ignoring it being
far less comfortable inside). Typically used as
a transfer craft for both passengers and cargo
between ships and inner worlds, it is a very
common sight throughout the Confederation.

Big, aggressive and very fast, the Baldr is an older
fighter from the Sword Worlds but pragmatism has
kept it in service in some planetary bombardment
squadrons. More of a ‘super jet’ than a true
space fighter, the Baldr is dedicated to the
ground strike role, using an array of underwing-mounted weaponry to destroy vehicles, infantry


concentrations and static targets. Its big reaction
drive and auxiliary thrusters allow it to slip past
defences before they are barely aware it is even
present in their airspace but fuel consumption is
staggering, requiring short missions and frequent
returns to a carrier or airbase.

Inspired by the torpedo boats common throughout
the Imperium, Sword World crews will be keen
to point out that their Vanguard fusion boat is
just better. Eschewing the stand-off capability of
torpedoes, the Vanguard is intended to wade into


furballs, shrug off incoming fire and devastate much
larger craft with its powerful fusion barbette. A full
squadron of Vanguards will cause even destroyers
and light cruisers to have second thoughts about
advancing into a system without adequate support.

Built on the same hull as the Vanguard fusion boat,
this craft dispenses with the high burn thruster and
instead sports a long-ranged stand-off capability by
way of a missile barbette. Intended to be deployed
in flight or squadron strength to overwhelm an
enemy with large salvoes, the Vanguard-M is


often launched alongside fusion boats to support
their advance towards an enemy fleet or orbital
installation. However, it is also quite capable of
conducting its own planetary bombardment if
equipped with suitable warheads.

There is something in the psyche of some Vargr
that demands speed and if some speed is good
then more must be better. The asteroid belt races
of the Extents have extremely high casualty rates,
and are often made illegal... but are compulsive
watching as mid-tech, reaction-drive-powered


racers roar at unbelievable speeds through the
thickest clusters of asteroids in the system. There
is very little else that racing craft can accomplish
but merely owning one is guaranteed to be
bought drinks in some Vargr bars.

A highly specialised fighter, the Gothta is unusual
in that it is built with a toughened pressurised
hull. This allows it to act as an ambush fighter,
lurking in the deeper atmosphere of a gas giant in
readiness to strike at an unsuspecting target. This
requires some degree of coordination between
forces, as the Gothta’s own sensors cannot detect


an approaching enemy, any more than the enemy
should be able to detect the fighter. Instead,
the Gothta must rely on deep-atmosphere
penetrating communications for the signal to
attack but, properly executed, this attack can be
devastating on refuelling starships.

Thanks to its auxiliary high-burn thruster, the
Nolrrgarrai is one of the fastest fighters in Charted
Space, much to the delight of the Vargr pilots
who fly it. Well armoured for a small fighter, this
craft excels at the strike role, burning hot towards


a target in flight or squadron strength, then
dashing away from any retaliation. Equally at
home in space or atmosphere, the Nolrrgarrai
is a common sight amongst the corsair fleets
emanating from the Extents.

Based on a 40-ton hull, the corsair pinnace is
intended as a boarding craft for Vargr corsair
ships. However, Vargr being what they are, it is
not quite as specialised as a boarding shuttle and
consequently gets used as a bit of everything. If
it were to be described as a ship’s boat that was


capable of conducting boarding attacks, that
would not be too shy of the mark. These pinnaces
can be seen throughout the Extents and beyond
its borders, acting as transports, passenger
conveyors, patrol craft and, of course, onboard
corsair ships as boarding shuttles.

The Tlatl (throwing blade) is a small but competent
fighter seen within Zhodani fleets, capable of
overwhelming more advanced enemies with
numbers. Ostensibly it is an anti-shipping
fighter but it serves well enough in the fighter


screening and anti-missile roles as well. While
not as powerful or exciting as some of its
contemporaries, it has been described as ‘slippery’
by those pilots who have flown against it.

A small shuttle, the Estal is designed to land an
individual or very small group on any world – even
one held by a hostile power. Normal operational
procedure is to launch the Estal from a ship at
the edge of a system, where the shuttle will likely


spend several days approaching its target planet
stealthily, taking care to plot a course that will avoid
contact with system defence forces. If detected, the
Estal is unarmed but its speed and stealth qualities
should allow it to evade any pursuit.

system defence vessels in preparation for a fleet
assault. When deployed in squadron strength, even


destroyer-sized ships are advised to take caution.
With a devastating fusion gun backed up by an
autoloading missile rack, the Kia can engage at all
ranges and has been built with some of the latest
technologies available to the Consulate.

The Zhodani’s Perfect Worlds strategy uses a
large survey carrier to enter a newly explored star
system decades before any serious colonisation
will begin. Upon arriving, the expedition will release
many smaller and specialised survey vessels to


travel to every planetary body and belt of the
system to assess their value. The Brechatsnech
is dedicated to exploring smaller planetoids and
belts, typically to gauge their mineral worth and
viability of planetoid habitats.

Welcome to the Small Craft Catalogue, featuring a vessel for your every need!


Small craft, those vessels of less than 100 tons and without a jump drive, are the workhorses of Traveller and
essential to the smooth running of every technological civilisation in Charted Space. This book gives you more
than 60 new small craft, to be used by Travellers, pirates, traders, government forces and corporations. Each
has a specific role and has been built to accomplish it with the best components available to its builders.


In this book you will find:


Modules: It is not just the Modular Cutter that can carry the 30-ton standard module, and there are many
configurations that greatly expand the operational capacity of these crafts.


Commercial Craft: Whether they are hauling cargo or passengers, there is a variety of small craft linking the
worlds of each star system, binding colonies and outposts together.


Working Craft: From the highport to the far reaches of the outsystem, these small craft keep the empires
running, fixing, rescuing, mining, and performing a multitude of other tasks.


Fighters: The most famous of small craft, high performance fighters are at the forefront of any outbreak of
hostilities, their pilots destined to become heroes – or to meet an untimely death in the void.


The Military: Between the fighter and the warship, there are many small craft that keep military forces in
the field and capable of acting effectively, from armoured transports and recon craft to assault boats and
system defence forces.


Luxury Craft: Owned by nobles and rich corporate executives, these small craft spare no expense at providing
the comfiest rides – and making sure everyone else knows it.


Aslan, Sword Worlds, Vargr and Zhodani: Beyond the Third Imperium and its affiliated states, other empires
can have very different takes on small craft design, but these vessels might just be the perfect in-system ride
for a group of Travellers.


Plus new rules on how your Travellers can use small craft to their best effect and bring another dimension
to their adventures.
