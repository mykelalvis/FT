  
[[UWP]] Data: The (Law Level) code of the [[UWP]] is categorized on the [[#UWP Law Level Codes Table]] to show prohibitions against weapons. It also influences the difficulty to avoid being harassed or arrested by local authorities.

The Law Level is only a guideline on local restrictions on possession and use of weapons by individuals. Police, Bonded Security and Military forces are usually not bound by these law levels, although they may be influenced by them. Private Security are bound by the same restrictions as individuals.

Note that "Imperial Law" can be described as [[LawLevel 1]]. Since Imperial Law supersedes [[Local Law]] within the [[Imperium]], it could be argued that there is nowhere within the bounds of the [[Imperium]] where the Law level is actually zero.

# History and Background (Dossier)
Law is an important component of developing civilizations and helps society to control or direct population behavior and focus on group goals. One of the defining characteristics of [[TechLevel 1|TL-1]] is the development of a formalized legal system.

Law levels above 11 would be considered Authoritarian, law levels of 14 or higher would be a police state. Typical authoritarian government restricting freedom of movement with cameras recording all public movement and some private would be at Law Level 11 to 12. On [[high tech worlds]], though, presence of convenience devices giving verbal control of lighting, entertainment consoles, and other household items, will continuously record the inside of a home, would constitute Law Level-12 if the government has automatic and convenient access to them, even if the devices are voluntary but ubiquitous. The citizens might even agree with the monitoring in some cases, given the extra benefits given. For an average citizen in such a society the feeling of general oppression in daily life would begin with Law Level-13, which would also be common in occupied territory, or territory with a history of civil strife or rebellion.

True totalitarian government, with all aspects of life monitored, would begin with LL:15-16. Interestingly enough the Imperial classification for Zhodani worlds would be high for unrestricted use of mind control, but the Zhodani equivalent law levels do not consider the use of mind control and monitoring to be a consideration with law level.
