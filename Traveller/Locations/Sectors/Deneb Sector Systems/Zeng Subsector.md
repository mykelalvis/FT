The Zeng subsector lies close to the fringe of the [[Great Rift]], giving it a hard border similar to that of . To rimward are a few worlds in Macon; a handful in Kamlar lie to trailing. As a result of its positioning, Zeng did not receive an equal share of early investment and has lagged behind the development of other subsectors since.

The Duchy of Zeng administers the worlds of Macon (to rimward, in Reft) and Kamlar. It is perhaps the weakest of the Denebian duchies but in many ways the most stable. It is not threatened by raids from across the coreward border and on the fringes of the internal powerplays of Deneb. Relations with the Duchy of Trin, on the far side of Gulf, are consistently good. Zeng has strong trade links running through Gulf and does all it can to protect them, which sometimes draws resources the duchy cannot really afford.

Zeng is protected by the 260th Fleet, one of two bearing that number. The 'Zeng 260th' is resentful of the way the other fleet of that number – stationed in the Antares sector – calls itself 'the first 260th', a claim based upon the difference in commissioning dates. The first 260th was to be redesignated and the name assigned to a new subsector fleet in Deneb but last-minute lobbying reversed the decision to rename the Antares-based force, although not before orders were sent to commission a new 260th in Zeng. The Zeng 260th sometimes refers to itself as 'the Only', in contrast to the Antares force claim to be the first, as at the time of its creation it was indeed the only fleet bearing that name. Whilst rather silly, this dispute is acrimonious and has been the cause of many a bar fight.

The 260th Fleet is overstrength compared to many other subsector fleets, with an unusually high proportion of destroyers. This is partly to allow coverage into nearby subsectors that have no fleet of their own but there may be other reasons. The presence of bases along the Great Rift fringe – and few towards the coreward end of the subsector – suggests an interest in the rift. The 260 th Fleet sometimes receives command of one or more high-jump rift cruisers designed for deep-space operations, although these are always handed back after a few months. It is not clear what these ships are doing but it may be that the 260th Fleet has responsibility for deep-space fuel caches. Other, wilder, theories claim it is charged with monitoring a deep-space installation or watching for some threat from within the Great Rift.
