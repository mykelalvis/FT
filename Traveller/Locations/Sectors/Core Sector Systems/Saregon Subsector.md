Saregon is the Core's most populated subsector with 286 billion sophonts living on 39 worlds. It has nine high-population worlds, four of which are industrial. Saregon is one of the most powerful subsectors in the Core, second only to Kaskii when it comes to industrial might. With its rich and growing economy, vibrant jump-1 main and powerful subsector navy, Saregon is in many ways the Imperial dream. In others, it is a dystopian nightmare.

Saregon has more than its share of police states and technologically enforced authoritarian regimes. There re eight worlds with Law Levels A+, all of which use and abuse surveillance technology to watch their people's every move. The draconian states on Dishadshii, Igla, Milpa and Dinad take the concept to another level; citizens are fitted with tracking devices at birth and forcibly implanted with wafer jacks, neural comms and neural links during adolescence. These devices are used to brainwash them and ensure absolute compliance with the dictates of those in power.

For its part, the world of Saregon is attempting to show these dictators there is another way. Saregonian technologists have leveraged the power of artificial intelligence to create what amounts to a post-scarcity anarchist utopia. The Imperial Navy has gotten into the act as well on worlds like Arla and Iimdii where military rule is giving way to low Law Level societies. After the chaotic collapse of an authoritarian government on Khuir, the Scout Service and Imperial Army restored order and are experimenting with a minimalist legal system that has yielded good results. Unfortunately, these attempts to lead by example have not swayed most dictators in the subsector, many of whom contend that without extreme laws, their societies would descend into chaos.

Another overriding theme of Saregon is the ongoing battle between megacorporation Tukera Lines and sector-wide corporation Achenaar Antilles. Tukera, which has major holdings in Delphi, has made inroads in the lower third of the subsector by using their industrial might to undercut Achenaar Antilles. The two lines have each accused the other of sabotage, commerce raiding and other skulduggery. Both have hired mercenary companies to secure their starships and industrial facilities. While some of the more outlandish claims made by the two corporations have been dismissed by the subsector duke, he has instructed the Imperial Navy to keep a close eye on events to ensure they do not boil over into a full-blown mercantile conflict.

The Imperial Navy's 273rd Fleet has its hands full in Saregon, patrolling the Core's borders, defending trade routes, quelling problems on its nine Amber Zone worlds, ensuring corporate conflicts do not escalate into something more and keeping a watchful eye on the Chanestin worlds on Saregon's spinward flank. The 273rd has 10 full squadrons at its disposal and has appointed highly regarded officers from the Admiralty to command them. Saregon has an aggressive, individualistic and rather unruly subsector culture. While the Imperium is careful not to play too heavy a hand, they have deployed the squadrons of the 273rd Colonial Fleet in an advisory role to many planetary navies. They must tread a fine line so as not to intrude upon the affairs of individual star systems but the general feeling is that more uniformity might mitigate some of the chaos.
