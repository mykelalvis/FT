### INTRODUCTION

# INTRODUCTION

In the worlds of _Traveller_ there are countless souls sailing across the
sea of stars in search of fame, fortune and perhaps some deeper
meaning to it all. Some are looking for the answer to the eternal
questions of their civilization, others simply want to get away from
it all and find something better in the void. Anything can happen in
the stretches of emptiness between worlds, and sometimes this can
mean trouble. For the unprepared, this is often fatal. If someone
cannot protect themselves from the dangers of the universe, there
are always others who will – for a price.

_Traveller: Mercenary_ is a guide to the gritty life of the hired gun. These
specialized few are often more than just soldiers looking for some
side money, they are frequently members of units of like-minded
militants that devote their lives to pulling the trigger. It is a hard life
to enjoy, and a harder one to be successful at. Wherever there are
spacefarers, there will be violence; where there is violence there is a
need for mercenaries.

From freelance soldiers of fortune to ranking grunts of a structured
military charter, there are mercenaries from all walks of life across
the universe. It is a good life of adventure for most travellers, and for
those fortunate enough to survive a long enough while in ‘the life’,
wealth, fame and adventure is almost certainly assured. Of course,
there is always the chance that the mercenary dies a horrible death
fighting a battle they never should have been involved with – but
that is just the hazards of the job, is it not?

#### Mercenaries within Traveller

From the basic character creation methods and tables found in
the core _Traveller_ rulebook, players can create military-minded
characters or just combat-oriented characters from other walks of
life. Although anyone can sell their services to the highest (or not
so highest) bidder to become a mercenary by the strictest definition
of the term, true mercenaries are a lot more than just a gun for a
paycheque.

_Traveller_ allows for any character to become gunslingers or
swordsmen if they wish to practice at those skills, but mercenaries
are dedicated to making it their livelihood. They require more
focussed training and attention than a common solider would; they
are mostly fighting for the credits – not for orders, their planet or
the Emperor. This makes them invest far more to protect their own
skins, and they have to be sure that their training must be better
than anyone they might go up against.

Mercenaries are commonly stereotyped as being violent, callous
and purely self-serving. Although some may be, it is not always the
case. Groups of mercenaries can be tighter and more fraternal than
familial brothers, and some charters have been around long enough
to have multiple generations of mercenaries raised in their ranks.

Just as it would be in the military, mercenaries must decide what
is more important to them on a ticket – their morals or their bank
accounts?

In Traveller , mercenaries are generally accepted by the spacefaring
culture. They are a monitored and standardised private force that
the rich and powerful can call upon to help them with their military
needs. The types of groups that hire mercenaries are vast; as are
their reasons for doing so. Companies might require a group of
escorts to protect something from their rivals, or they could seek
someone to strike at the competition in a more direct fashion than
with price wars or corporate takeovers. Governments often use
mercenaries to do what their armed services cannot, either morally
or sometimes even legally. Private parties rarely have the funds or
connections to acquire a mercenary ticket, but those that do can
have the strangest and most unique motives. In effect mercenaries
are far more prevalent than in our reality; they exist to fill the roles
that others fall short of.

The use of mercenaries is a vital part of the small skirmishes that
often take place on the frontier borders of expanding space. Full
militaries are too structured or limited in their abilities to function as
they should; their hands commonly tied with political or corporate
red tape. As interests move beyond the limits of law and government,
mercenaries are the best solutions for many of the hazards found in
the less well travelled regions of space. The mercenaries do the job,
the employers reap the awards, and everyone goes home happy; in
theory, at least.

Mercenaries do what they feel they can and must do in order to
pay their bills, fill their stomachs and pass the time. While this
makes them individualistic and unpredictable, it also makes them
numerous and somewhat expendable – all perfect traits for Player
Characters in a Traveller game.

#### Mercenaries in Specific Traveller Settings

> [!MERCENARIES1] Mercs
> This book is written with a general setting in mind, specifically one that has legalised mercenary activity for the use on the space frontier (like that of the Third Imperium setting). This does not mean that every setting or culture will have the same rules and limitations on the existence and use of mercenaries. One government might freely utilise mercenary groups to put down threats, but the next could think all mercenaries are nothing but criminals.
>
> The overall usage of mercenaries is limited by the designed setting of the Referee, as he may or may not want to make his game ‘easy’ for his mercenary Player Characters.

### INTRODUCTION

#### What This Book Adds to Traveller

_Traveller: Mercenary_ brings a new type of character to the table – the
professional mercenary. Whether it is a member of a bodyguard
service in the private sector or a plasma-slinging paramilitary
guerrilla, players can turn their normal _Traveller_ characters into
something else entirely. This book is written to expand the scope
of _Traveller_ to include these professional soldiers-for-hire in many
ways.

Most readers will look into the first chapter as the main reason they
are picking up this book. The start of the book is devoted to the
creation of mercenary Player Characters. It is filled with new career
paths, advancements and mishaps that can shape a character to
become the best mercenary they can. From the first term that he
qualifies to do so, a character can begin the life of a true mercenary.
No matter if they left the armed services on their own or at gunpoint,
they might be able to find profit in selling their services here. The
new career paths listed in this book are designed to be used in
addition to those found in the core rulebook – not replace them.

The book also contains a chapter dedicated to the addition of new
skills that _Traveller_ characters can now utilise. These skills range in
use and purpose, but they can be important to characters devoted to
professional soldiering. Although designed to appear in the creation
tables for the mercenary career paths, these new skills can also be
acquired by some of the core _Traveller_ careers; how this is possible
is noted here as well.

Mercenaries do not simply wander around looking for their next job.
They are commonly sought out and hired on an official and legal
contract. These contracts are collectively called ‘tickets’ in _Traveller_ ,
and they represent a fully-enclosed mission that the mercenaries
are being hired to accomplish. Mercenary tickets are the bread-
and-butter of a mercenary’s life, sometimes literally. This book
includes the full description for Referees of how to create individual
mercenary tickets for their games. Either using the detailed facets of
ticket creation or the random tables given in this book, a Referee can
not only quickly draw up a mission for their players to set out on, but
also can know how much something like that would pay. The use of
mercenary tickets is a standard in the business, and this book tells
readers precisely how they work and how to create them.

As mercenaries leave behind their freelance or order-taking days
in search of becoming something more, they might decide to start
their own mercenary groups or charters. They will need to recruit
new members in order to do this effectively. This book offers a good
system on how any given character, not just mercenaries, can go
out and recruit hirelings and subordinates. If any character is skilled
and convincing enough, they could acquire the men they are looking
to lead.

With the addition of more militarily-leaning missions and tickets,
this book also brings a few new additions to the way larger battles
and combats work in _Traveller_. With new rules concerning morale,
suppression fire and the like will allow Referees to bring a new style
of gritty realism or heroism to their battles. These rule additions will
turn a common fire fight between larger groups from a clunky dice-
rolling frenzy to a full scale conflict worthy of media attention.

Whether in a true military or a private mercenary unit, active combat
forces need a place to recover, rearm and re-equip. Commanding
officers need stations where they can plan everything the unit needs
and important documents should be stored safely in case of an
unexpected leadership change. This book contains a detailed list
of possible bases and headquarters useful to Referees in order to
create the central locations of their game’s mercenary and military
units.

A good mercenary is only as good as the equipment he is trained
to use, and this book brings a host of new bits of gear for just
that reason. Adhesive bandages, gyro-stabilized hip rigs, and anti-
personnel airburst artillery rounds are just a few examples of the new
and fantastic equipment this book unveils. With so many wonderful
new toys to choose from, Player Characters might join a mercenary
ticket just to get access to some of them!

Traveller: Mercenary is not just a guide to living the life of a hired gun.
It serves as a collection of useful rules additions and augmentations
to the entire system, bringing a brand new facet of adventure and
excitement to the Traveller system.

### INTRODUCTION

## MERCENARY SLANG AND LEXICON

The following is a short collection of common terminology used by many mercenaries and their allies in the _Traveller_ universe. Players
of mercenary characters should pay attention to these words and phrases, as that their employers, partners and employees will often
use them in common parlance.

Ace(d) – Any one-shot/one-strike kill; as in ‘I aced him with my seventy-six, right in the eye!’
‘Act the Part’ – Overplaying a dramatic stance as a mercenary in order to earn a bigger reputation
Aggro – Becoming overly violent or aggressive; as in ‘Whoa! Why all the aggro? It was just a joke!’
Bar Tab – A tongue-in-cheek term used to describe the amount of money spent on supplies for a specific ticket
Black Op – Any ticket that cannot be officially or legally claimed; most often also a ‘wet ticket’
Camo Job – Any ticket that will require the use of standard military fatigues, uniforms or other apparel; alternatively a ticket where the mercenary is hired by an armed service branch
Cloak and Dagger – Any ticket that requires stealth or anonymity
Dead Ticket – A mission that has been tried and failed; also used to describe a ticket that has passed its expiration without being undertaken
ETC – Anagram for ‘estimated time to conflict’; as in ‘I have the convoy in my sights, what is our ETC?’
FUBAR – Anagram for ‘fouled up beyond all repair’; can also be used as a profanity; as in ‘The evacuation site is crawling with hostiles, this ticket is FUBAR.’
Glassing – The use of high explosives or incendiary devices to deal with a lightly or unarmored target
Heat/Hot – Slang term for violent conflict, as in ‘Negative, I cannot get in yet. Too much heat out here to ignore. I could use some help.’
‘High Tide’ – A description of very high or unexpected activity in a conflict situation; as in ‘Get that PGMP up here, it is pretty damned high tide outside that bulkhead!’
Ice Cold Ticket – A mission that requires a low sense of morals and likely a great deal of violent action
JIR – Anagram for ‘justifiable immediate response’; or the level of violent action that should be taken in response to opposing stimuli
‘Low Tide’ – A description of little or low activity in a possible conflict; as in ‘Holster up your big guns guys, its nothing but low tide the rest of the way.’
Meatmonger – Derogatory term for any mercenary that is overly violent in situations where it is not necessary
Merc – Slang term for any mercenary; sometimes used by non-mercenaries in the derogatory
One-off Job – Any ticket from a new employer that has no current plans of re-hiring the mercenaries afterward
Park Walk – Any ticket that is appraised as being far easier than the overall skill level of the mercenary group signed on to it
Sandbag – Extremely derogatory term for a mercenary who is not holding up his share of a specific ticket; as in ‘Move your sandbag ass Hawkins! You are slowing us all down!’
‘Take Two’ – Anytime a skilled mercenary fails at a simple task and is forced to perform it again
Trial by Fire – A mercenary’s first combat-based ticket
Zoo Trip – Any ticket that takes the mercenary to an unknown location with unknown flora/fauna that must be dealt with in some way

Although this supplement deals primarily with mercenaries and
their careers there is also room to include slighly amended rules
for army and marine characters. In addition to providing expanded
Mishap and Events tables that remain true to those included in this
book two new career options for military personel are added - the
(oceanic or wet) navy and air force.

Few planetary forces are based solely upon ground troops; many
use extensive atmospheric air forces or hydrospheric naval fleets.
Because of this, there is room for additional and alternative
career options based on the Army career path in the _Traveller_ core
rulebook.

These options, (Wet) Navy and Air Force, are considered to have
the same general form and function of the Army career path. They
are the localised armed forces for their government, although

#### NEW ARMY MISHAPS

2 2d6d 6 MMishapishap
2 Finding conditions to be inhumane under a barely sane commander during your current posting you desert and are
now a wanted man. Gain 1d3 Enemies amongst the military, including your former commanding officer, who try to
bring you to justice.
3 You are involved in a disasatrous campaign and barely escape off planet in a frantic and badly organised
evacuation. This leaves you a long way from your own lines and you make 1D3 Contacts as you return home.
However you find yourself a wanted man and are listed as AWOL by an inquisitional commission that has come
down hard on those even remotely involved in the debacle.
4 Your regiment merges with another due to budgetry constraints. You are one of those who are not offered a
position within the new unit and are forced to leave the service.
5 You spend several days in the brig after getting into a fight with a superior officer. Gain that officer as a Rival as he
has you ejected out of the service.
6 Severely wounded. Roll twice on the Injury table and take the lower result.
7 Your unit is slaughtered in a disastrous battle, for which you blame your commander. Gain him as an Enemy as he
has you removed from the service.
8 Injured. Roll on the Injury table
9 You are sent to a very unpleasant region (jungle, swamp, desert, icecap, urban) to battle against guerrilla fighters
and rebels. You are discharged because of stress, injury or because the government wishes to bury the whole
incident. Increase Recon or Survival by one level but also gain the rebels as an Enemy.
10 You discover that your commanding officer is engaged in some illegal activity, such as weapon smuggling. You can
join his ring and gain him as an Ally before the inevitable investigation gets you discharged, or you can co-operate
with the military police – the official whitewash gets you discharged anyway but you may keep your Benefit roll from
this term of service.
11 You are tormented by or quarrel with an officer or fellow soldier. Gain that officer as a Rival as he drives you out of
the service.
12 You have a strong relationship with a munitions supplier which is deemed to be too close by your superiors and
you are ‘requested’ to resign from the service. Gain the supplier as a Contact..

they might have attachments to space navies or interplanetary
soldiering. Unless otherwise noted, these two career path options
are considered to be interchangeable with the Army path for logistic
purposes (perhaps with a little narrative adjustments here and
there).

Referees and players can choose to make characters from these
career options if it makes more sense (a water-world using (Wet)
Navy instead of Army, for instance) or simply if they wish to do so.

Also included here are expanded Mishap and Event tables for
the Army and Marine professions, allowing a greater variety in a
character’s career in keeping with the expanded tables found with
all the new careers described within this book.

The primary goal of this sourcebook is to open up the possibility
for new and existing _Traveller_ characters to become members of a
mercenary unit. Whether it is out of necessity because of the state
of their world, the need to erase certain debts from powerful people,
or simply because they have a ‘knack’ for it – characters can become
mercenaries.

This chapter is dedicated to those new characters that want to try
out the lifestyle of a soldier-of-fortune.

#### Basic Character Creation for a Mercenary

This chapter follows the normal stages of character creation as
detailed in the _Traveller_ core rulebook, pointing out where and how
players and Referees can branch away from the standard career
paths in order to use what is available in _Traveller: Mercenary_.

## THE MERCENARY CAREER PATHS

The following career paths are specifically designed for those
involved with mercenary units. They tend to be combat-oriented and
are dangerous to spend multiple terms in.

There are six distinct mercenary career paths – Cadre, Commando,
Guerrilla, Security, Striker and Warmonger. These careers are all

based on the idea that the character will be directly involved with
the acquiring and completion of mercenary tickets.

#### Choosing a Mercenary Career

There are two distinct ways to choose to roll a term on a mercenary
career path. Either simply meet the listed Qualifications of the
path as normal, or meet the ‘Previous Service’ terms listed for
each mercenary career. Effectively, a character that has spent some
time in a military role is more likely to be able to fill a position as a
mercenary.

#### NEW BENEFIT – PRIME TICKET

The mercenary careers have access to a new type of mustering-
out benefit called Prime Ticket. This symbolises the character’s
closeness and availability to work with the same employers they
had in that career in the future. This benefit means they can
choose to call in the Prime Ticket at any time the character is
directly involved in creating a new mercenary ticket (see the
Mercenary Tickets chapter), allowing them to gain 10 additional
Ticket Adjustments when creating their next ticket. These Ticket
Adjustments must be used in the next ticket arranged, and
cannot carry over if unused.

### CCCRREATINGREEAATTIINNGG AAA M MMEERCENARYERRCCEENNAARRYY

Cadre mercenaries frequently fill tickets that revolve around the
training of new recruits. It is not uncommon for a cadre to be asked

## WARTIME EVENTS

Characters that choose the life of a mercenary know they are headed
into a world of conflicts and unrest, many of which they will try to
make a profit upon. Because of the amount of time that mercenaries
spend away from the ‘real worlds’ and in battlefields, military bases
and demilitarised zones. Mercenary characters (or common career
characters in hostile surroundings, if the Referee wishes) have the
chance to experience unique events. If you roll a Wartime Event on
the Events table for your career, roll on the Wartime Event table.

#### WARTIME EVENTS

RRoll 2d6oll 2 d 6 EEventvent
2 Just a Flesh Wound: You are lightly wounded. Roll two dice on the Injury table, choosing the higher result.
3 Heartfelt Confession: Someone close to your, likely within you unit, is fatally wounded and dies in your arms.
Whilst dying, he or she confesses something previously unknown to you; from knowing about a traitor to
explaining where stolen treasure might be.
4 Double-cross: Someone on your side in a conflict turns on them at the last moment, causing tension within
the unit. Paranoia and distrust exists in the ranks for some time to come. Gain a Rival.
5 Impressive Scar: You were wounded by an alien weapon that left a strange scar on your face or neck. It does
not hurt anymore, but it does give you a rough exterior that is sometimes difficult to ignore.
6 Camaraderie: You become very close to the other members of your unit and such fraternity is rewarded with
unquestioning acceptance. If you choose to remain in the same career path and assignment for your next
term, you do not need to roll for Qualification.
7 You save a member of your unit’s life and gain a new Ally.
8 Weapon Cache. You stumble upon a stockpile of weaponry and armament. When no one is looking you
manage to claim a piece of the find for yourself. Add an Armor, Combat Implant or Weapon Benefit (player’s
choice) when you muster out.
9 Employment Offer: The character is approached by a potential future employer, and the unit is set up for
another conflict before the current one is even concluded. You gain a +2 DM to your next Qualification roll.
10 Heroic Stand: You are caught alone in a fire fight where you hold off an enemy force for a prolonged period of
time. Increase Social Standing by 1 or gain a +1 DM to your next Benefits roll.
11 Trouble with Authorities: Your unit is arrested and detained for supposed illegal wartime activities. Lose one
Benefit roll or reduce your Social Standing by 1.
12 Unusual Event: Something odd has occurred. Roll 1d6
1 – Meta-Intelligence Officer. You encounter a Psionic officer, who offers to spend some time with you. You
may immediately test your Psionic Strength (see page 152 of the Traveller core rulebook) and can, if you
qualify, take the Psionist career in your next term.
2 – Alien Mercs. You are saddled with a small unit of alien mercenaries for a few tickets. Gain a Life Science
and a Contact among an alien race.
3 – Military Black Market. You are approached by a black marketeer who has some advanced technology for
sale - cheap. You may choose any piece of TL12 or less piece of personal equipment instead of taking the cash
from a Benefits roll.
4 – Shell Shock. You were knocked into a short coma by artillery, and lost several weeks of your memory.
5 – Governmental Award. You and your unit are publicly heralded by the government you were serving. This
ruins anonymity, but increases Social Standing by 1.
6 – Ancient weapon technology. You discovered a weapon older than the Imperium. Now, if you could only
figure out how to use it.

#### Mercenary Retirement Benefits – Friends &

#### Favors

Unlike many of the common career classes presented in Traveller ,
mercenaries are not fortunate enough to receive a retirement
package – they rarely live long enough to receive one anyway! They
do however, get access to a network of old friends and favors that
non-mercenary characters do not.

A character that leaves a mercenary service at the end of the 5th or
later term of service is assumed to have created one of these friend
and favor networks. They are allowed to roll on the table below
once for each term beyond the 4th they spent in the career. The
results are added benefits that the character receives.

### CCRREATINGEATING AA MMEERCENARYRCENARY

might be. Aslan are not terribly well-known for their soft, nurturing
demeanours – making mercenary life perfect for them.

#### Droyne

The strange and enigmatic Droyne rarely enter the greater galactic
community, and when they do so it is almost always on their own
terms and for their own unfathomable reasons. Although they do
occasionally join with mercenaries for specific tickets, they are not
known to ever do it on a permanent basis. Simply speaking, the
Droyne are not stable enough for mercenary life.

#### Hivers

Frequently found on the employer side of a mercenary ticket, the
Hivers are generally opposed to getting physically involved with their
targets directly, which makes hiring mercenaries perfect for them. In
Hiver society, such endeavors are looked poorly upon when not a
tentacles-off policy is taken in mercenary work. Their bodies are not
built for the types of rugged service or physical combat that most
mercenaries must engage in order to be succeed, so it is simply
better for them if they remain the employers of mercenaries rather
than the employees.

#### K’Kree

Even though they may say they would prefer to take a plasma
charge to the chest before travelling around in a cramped starship,
the ‘centaurs’ make remarkably good mercenaries for ground
operations. So long as they can stay out of spacecraft-related tickets,
their powerful physiques and multi-limbed frames can be extremely
useful to a mercenary unit. A K’Kree will happily fight against their
foes, especially if aimed at meat-eating targets.

#### Vargr

The pack mentality of the canine Vargr makes them perfectly suited
for life within a mercenary unit. They constantly strive to help and
out-do one another for personal prestige amongst their fellows, and
enjoy the long hours and cramped quarters. Their physical makeup
is well suited for close quarters and firearms combat, and their
naturally energetic lifestyle lends them the drive to finish even the
most tedious of tickets. Their society loves the idea of a mercenary’s
life; they go so far as raise their children to become them.

#### Zhodani

It is a rare Zhodani indeed that will decide to join the mercenary life.
Their society tends not to have present the factors that create the
need for mercenaries and they tend to look down on this barbarous
element of the Imperium. Some Zhodani occasionally may be found
operating in border areas as mercenaries, but they are few and far
between. Even if more did wish for this life prejudices against them
within the Imperium (where most mercenary work can be found)
makes it difficult to find employment.

#### FRIENDS & FAVOURS

12 You were named as an inheritor on an old
colleague’s last will. Gain +15,000 credits

#### Medical Debts – You Are On Your Own

Unlike a steady job with the armed services or a common corporation,
working with mercenary groups is tenuous and risky. It is dangerous
work, and the hiring units know that. Where a common career might
insure an employee for medical costs from being injured on the job,
a mercenary’s life is often riddled with injuries.

This means that any character that receives medical debts due
to injuries received during a term in a mercenary career will not
see any of that debt paid by their employers. Mercenaries who get
themselves too beat up in their tickets will need to then take on
more tickets to pay for the bills incurred in the first, and so on. It
is this cycle of working to pay for ‘repairs’ after working that leads
so many mercenaries to dying on the job – it is easier than trying to
keep up with the doctors’ bills!

## ALIEN MERCENARY CHARACTERS

The most common setting for the _Traveller_ game, the Third
Imperium, has several alien races that players and Referees can
choose to create characters from. Many of them make fantastic
mercenaries, and some even have cultural leanings toward it.

#### Aslan

Just like their other career opportunities, they seem to divide their
ideology on mercenary life as well. Male Aslan tend toward the
more physical aspects of the career (Commando, Strike), while
females tend toward the more administrative or supporting roles
(Cadre, Warmonger). As a race they do not see anything wrong
with selling their services, no matter what the moral implications

### CCRREATINGEATING AA MMEERCENARYRCENARY

## MEDALS AND COMMENDATIONS

Characters from a military background are capable of earning
medals for any heroic action they might have taken during their
years of service with the Army, Marines, Navy or within a Mercenary
career. The awards here are those presented by the Imperium to its
armed forces, different governments will have their own rewards
with their own names, although what the different medals represent
will reflect those of the Imperium. Many mercenary units will have
their own awards and since they are often working for governments
can find themselves eligible for a wide range of decorations.

These medals are awarded during character generation whenever the
character is involved in a Mishap or Event that is combat orientated
and needs a skill roll to prevent injury. The result of this roll will
determine what medal(s) is/are received by the character.

CCombat Ribbon: ombat Ribbon: Any character that is in a combat Event or Mishap
will automatically be awarded a Combat Ribbon. These will include
a citation that will detail the character’s name, rank, unit and the
name and date of the action. Although the Imperium does keep
track of such awards they are not advertised greatly, although on
smaller planets or settlements a well-travelled favorite son may
well get a mention in the local news media if he receives a Combat
Ribbon.

CCombat Command Ribbon: ombat Command Ribbon: Any officer that receives a Combat
Ribbon is automatically awarded with a Combat Command Ribbon.
This award recognizes the fact that the character has led troops into
battle and will provide the same details as a Combat Ribbon. Many
mercenary units will offer higher positions to ex-service personnel
who have a Combat Command Ribbon ahead of those who have
just gained rank without having led men in combat. Local media is
more likely to pick up on the reward of such a medal, but it will not
feature in any major network or periodical.

PPurple Heart: urple Heart: Any character that has to roll on the injury table
having failed his skill roll is awarded a Purple Heart. The medal will
again have all the details of the character and incident upon it and is
considered a more notable reward than either the Combat Command
Ribbon or Combat Ribbon by most civilians. Mercenary units tend to
be less impressed though, although they will respect a man willing
to risk his life and shed blood for his cause/regiment/comrades.
The award is much more likely to be featured in local media and any
character returning to his homeworld/town/neighborhood is more
likely to receive a hero’s welcome.

MMeritorious Conduct under Fire (MCUF): eritorious Conduct under Fire (MCUF): The MCUF is the first
medal for bravery awarded to those who show bravery on the field
of battle. Although many thousands of these are awarded every year
within the Imperium they are considered to be a great honor to
receive. This medal, and its more illustrious medals for bravery, is
very highly regarded in both military and civilian circles. An individual

awarded such a medal will be honored by his community with,
at the least, a public reception by local dignitaries. A character is
awarded this medal if the Effect of his skill roll is 3 or more.

MMedal for Conspicuous Gallantry (MCG): edal for Conspicuous Gallantry (MCG): Considered for acts
of great heroism, the MCG is a very notable reward indeed. The
bravery of those given this award is unquestioned and those that
receive it are likely to get widespread recognition, with larger media
outlets noting the reward. A character is awarded this medal if the
Effect of his skill roll is 5 or more.

SStarburst for Extreme Heroism (SEH): tarburst for Extreme Heroism (SEH): The SEH is the highest
honor that can be achieved by an individual under arms in the
Imperium. Generals, Admirals and Subsector Dukes will all salute
the man, or woman, who has shown the outstanding heroic qualities
necessary to win the award. Despite the vast nature of the Imperium
and many conflicts that it will be engaged in an individual receiving
the medal is still notable enough to be reported in major news media
and those that receive the reward can expect a (deserved) hero’s
welcome when they return home. A mercenary unit will welcome
a bearer of the medal into its ranks, the prestige alone being worth
their while, let alone the benefit of having such a notable warrior
within its ranks. A character is awarded this medal if the Effect of his
skill roll is 7 or more.

#### Going for Glory

Some players will want to take every opportunity they can to gain
the highest military honors possible during character creation.
As a result it is possible for players to go for glory whenever they
are presented with a chance for a reward. A character may add
up to 3 to the difficulty of the skill roll, making it much more
likely to be injured. However, when it comes to receiving an
award the modifier is added to the Effect instead.

Example: Ensign Thomas Atkins, Jnr is serving in the Wet Navy
on his homeworld when he engages enemy forces. The enemy
boards his craft and he must fight them off (Event 53 on the
Wet Navy Events Table). Deciding that this may be his only
opportunity for glory Atkins leaps into the fray, taking a massive
+3DM to the target number he needs to roll. Taking the dice he
rolls a 4 and a 3, he has a skill of 2 in Melee (Unarmed) and 9 Str
for a further +1. This gives him a total of 10, however he needs
11+ to avoid injury and is hurt in the ensuing fight.

Checking to see if he has won a medal for his pains, he adds +3
to the total for his bravery, getting a 13. This is 5 more than the
8+ normally needed to avoid injury (this number is unchanged
for the purpose of determining if the character will receive an
award), and young Tommy’s bravery does not go unnoticed. He
will receive the MCG and also gain a Purple Heart (for his injury),
a Combat Ribbon and a Combat Command Ribbon, assuming
he will survive his wounds

### NNEEWW SSKKILLSILLS

Those who have joined the ranks of the mercenaries, or simply
those who have studied some of their talents, can apply a host of
new and interesting abilities in their everyday lives. New equipment
types, the need for certain knacks and even just a basic desire to
excel in their careers give mercenary characters better access to
these specialized abilities.

This chapter is dedicated to a handful of new skills designed for
use by mercenary characters in _Traveller_ and new specialties to old
skills that can be now added to those core rules. Additionally, there
is an entire section of addendums to the core career paths found in
the main rulebook – adding the new skills to some of the original
careers if they are desired.

## New Skills and Specialities

Each New Skill is noted with an ‘*’ in front of its name and is
described here using the basic following format:

those uses.

#### NEW SPECIALTIES AND COMMON CHECKS FOR CORE SKILLS

If this book presents a new speciality or check for the core skills
found in the _Traveller Core Rulebook_ , they will be listed under the

    fill the space between pistols and rifles; autocarbine, gauss
    carbine, etc.

    weapons and snub pistols.

#### Heavy Weapons

- FFlamethrowers: Using weaponry designed to project lamethrowers:

#### * Instruction

This skill allows the character to help others learn from their
knowledge and experience. Anyone with the Instruction skill can
pass on the basics of their own knowledge to less experienced
characters over a period of time. They can, with a successful check,
pass skills to other characters up to a maximum level of one less
than their Instruction skill or one less than their own skill level in
the skill being taught (whichever is lower). Thus, a character with
Instruction 4, Admin 4 Explosives 2 and Pilot 5 could teach another
character Admin 3 and Explosives 1 (the skill -1) but only Pilot 3
(Instruction level -1).

Teaching the skill requires an Instruction test on the behalf of the
teacher, which takes between 1-6 days less than the time it would
normally take (depending on Timing – see page 59 of the Traveller
main rulebook). The number of students that can benefit from this
teaching is equal to the Effect of the check. During the training,
the Referee should severely curtail the activities of all characters
involved.

At the conclusion of the training, the learning character(s) must then
succeed in an Education or Intelligence roll with a Target Number
of 8+. Player Characters cannot teach the Instruction skill to other
Player Characters. The greatest assets an individual character has
is his pool of skills, so we encourage the Referee to exercise great
caution in allowing Player Characters to simply hire Non-Player
Characters for their Instruction skill.

#### * Interrogation

Mercenaries are often forced to draw information out of sources
that do not wish to give it. This places the mercenary in a position to
use any number of methods to extract it. This skill governs several
ways to force others to give up what they know – knowingly or not.

#### * Recruiting

This skill governs the ability to recognize the best individuals to
attempt to bring into the character’s allegiance, group or affiliation.
Used primarily by mercenaries to find new blood for their charter,
this skill can also be used by those simply looking for related
hirelings or employees. The Recruiting skill also governs the ability
a character has to be the most approachable and acceptable when
trying to acquire these new comrades as well.

The full rules for mercenary recruiting can be found in the Recruiting
Unit Members chapter of this book. Otherwise this skill is used to
better gauge the potential of new recruits or other could-be allies,
and the ability in which the character has to hire them.

Recruiting 0 allows the character to recognize anyone who shares
a career path term with him, and the knowledge of what that path
is. Recruiting 1 grants the character the ability to know the average
skill level of a character that shares a career path term with him.
Recruiting 2 allows the character the ability to know the highest and
lowest skill (and level) of a character that shares a career path with
him.

manoeuvrability and potential power in close quarters fighting. The
character with this specialty may add his level in Zero-G to his Melee
skill in a low or zero gravity combat.

## ADDING MERCENARY SKILLS TO

## CORE CAREER PATHS

The five new skills added to Traveller from this book cannot be
expected to solely be in the possession of mercenary characters,
and should be available to any character generated. As these skills
are generated by the choosing of career paths, the core careers in
the basic rulebook do not have these new skills in their possible
learning paths as written.

### NNEEWW SSKKILLSILLS

To allow players and Referees creating characters to have access to
these skills during character creation using even just the core career
paths found in the basic rulebook, we have pointed out several
places in a common character creation where the new skills can be
_substituted_ for those as written if the Referee allows for it.

The following are all of the places in the _Traveller_ core character
creation system where the new mercenary-based skills could be
acquired.

#### Navy Career

When performing a term in the Navy career path, the following skill
substitutions can be noted.

- Mechanic can be substituted with Weapon Engineering

    can be substituted with Weapon Engineering 1

#### ALTERNATE CHARACTER GENERATION RULES

All of the alternate methods of generating a Traveller character
given in the core rulebook are designed to not have to rely upon the
career path tables, and are therefore exempt from all of the above
substitutions and additions. Instead of applying them as listed
above, the player or Referee simply chooses to purchase the new
skills with the Point Allocation system as normal.

### MMEERCENARYRCENARY TTIICKETSCKETS

Every mercenary in the _Traveller_ universe is looking for one primary
goal in their chosen careers – money. Where a common spacefaring
citizen in _Traveller_ can just go out and get a job using the skills
that they have, a mercenary is not as lucky. A mercenary’s skills are
most commonly built for combat, which is not something that the
average spacefarer can make money at. Not legally; not without
being signed to a _ticket_.

Tickets are legally sanctioned, but not always publicly known,
contracts between one party (the employer) and the mercenary unit
involved (the employee). Each ticket is backed by the local authority
that must be present when it is drawn, and should dictate what the
mercenaries are required to do in order to get paid. It is, essentially,
the most important piece of documentation a mercenary can own.

Although just having a ticket does not necessarily mean that the
authorities (the legal agency in the vicinity of the ticket’s execution)
will accept it, merely that someone with the right lawyers, money
and power will stand behind the mercenaries if need be. Having a
properly drawn up ticket with a group of mercenaries will not make
them immune to legal retribution, but it will protect them most of
the time.

This chapter is a comprehensive look at how to create a mercenary
ticket, what they actually do in the _Traveller_ game setting for those
who have them, and a list of a few standardised tickets for Referees
to use when the players are not feeling like negotiating.

## WHAT IS IN A TICKET?

A mercenary ticket is drawn only as detailed as the mercenary unit
needs it to be, leaving out whatever details they feel they will need
to. Properly drawn tickets can contain any and all of the following
portions.

#### Employer Details

This section of any ticket discusses the party or parties involved that
will be hiring the mercenary to perform the duties of the ticket itself.
The details of the employer(s) are often very precise and meticulous
in their description, as it is very easy for a mercenary to _adjust_ his
loyalties if this is not the case. An employer with any bit of sense
will make sure that the ticket explains exactly who they are, so an
unscrupulous mercenary unit cannot hope to double-cross them in
the future.

It is common practice for employers to list themselves by the largest
of terms. A company will not be listed by the executive brokering
the deal, and a government will not list a ticket under the president
or leader. This is actually done for two reasons; to keep the ticket
sanctioned even if that individual is no longer with the employer,

and to make sure that no one person can be blamed in the eye of the
public. Ticket information are sometimes considered public domain
in some areas after they have been fulfilled or cancelled, so group
names are best served to avoid personal vendettas.

#### Employee Details

This section is the most important for the continued reputation of
the mercenary unit hiring to the ticket. It describes which and how
many members in the mercenary unit will be required to complete
the ticket. The more manpower a ticket leaves room for, the easier
the ticket will likely be, but also means lessened profitability. If a
ticket requests specialists, it means the price can be driven up.
This section of a ticket is the best place for a growing mercenary
company to include its specifics – adding to its reputation with each
fresh contract.

The employee details of a mercenary ticket are also where a unit
can choose to operate under false names, anonymous details, or
limited facts about them. Depending on the services needed, and
perhaps the targets of those services, not being recognized for the
work being done can be better for the mercenaries in the long run.

#### Service Required

Arguably the most important section on any ticket, this is where the
actual business of the contract is listed. Unlike other areas of the
ticket, where ambiguity might be useful, the services section needs
to be as detailed as possible for the benefit of both parties. If the
services are drafted too vaguely, the ticket could be misinterpreted
and the job done improperly. The employer wants the ticket to be
precise in order to get the job done right; the employee wants the
service to be explained as plainly and specific as it can be. The result
is hopefully a clear image of exactly what they have to do to get
paid.

#### Pre-Ticket Support

There are some tickets that require special equipment or services
to occur before the employee can begin to fulfil the services. Some
employers will understand this fact and arrange for this special
support as part of the ticketing process. If a ticket’s services are
going to be difficult without certain gear the employer is frequently
expected to at least offer the funds to equip themselves, if not the
equipment itself.

For obvious reasons, this section is very important to the mercenary
unit involved. If they want to survive such a specialized ticket, this
sort of pre-service assistance is necessary. Some mercenary units
pride themselves on rarely needing pre-ticket support, but most are
happy to get at least a little payment before the action begins.

# MMEERCENARYRCENARY TTIICKETSCKETS

### MMEERCENARYRCENARY TTIICKETSCKETS

#### Post-Ticket Support

Events unfortunately happen while in the course of a ticket’s
fulfilment that cannot always be expected, and often the employer
makes ready for that. Items attached to a ticket like assisted health
care, rearmament fees, or something as simple as evacuation
transportation can be placed under post-ticket support. This section
of a mercenary ticket is dedicated to what the employer is willing to
do for the employee after a ticket’s service has been met, beyond
simple financial payment.

Employers rarely choose to add a great deal into post-ticket support
unless it somehow figures into their overall cost of hiring the unit.
For instance, an employer that has access to a fleet of fast space
cutters might throw in transportation for free, but pay slightly less
in hard currency as a result. A medical frigate could allow for post-
ticket first aid or surgery in exchange for reduced fees or pre-ticket
support. Few employers give services away for free, but when they
need to get just the right unit to fill their ticket – they may have to.

#### Compensation Package

The most important part of a ticket to all parties involved, the
compensation package of the contract is what describes the
financial fees involved with its fulfilment. Employers want to get as
much as they can out of the ticket for the least amount. Employees
want to get paid as much as they can for as little work as possible.
Essentially, everyone wants to get to the successful end of a ticket
while gaining as much as they can – so long as they gain more than
the other side of the contract.

Although the actual credit value of a ticket’s compensation is
almost always the main wage an employee can earn, but many try to
get additional compensations in the form of material gains. Guns,
armor, even ship shares will sometimes be offered in lieu of cash,
but not as commonly as some mercenaries might like.

#### Repatriation Bond

Rarely used but almost assuredly included, this section of a ticket
is designed to protect the employee in the unlikely case that the
employer falls apart, is disbanded or dies before the ticket can be
completed. In the case where an employer is not around to fulfil
its end of the ticket, the repatriation bond is a lump sum of credits
due to the employee at the ticket’s closing. This sum is often less
(sometimes dramatically so) than that of the agreed compensation
package, but every mercenary unit likes to see they get paid for their
efforts. Getting back from a ticket and receiving some payment is
far better than getting back to find that an employer no longer exists
and neither does the wage.

The repatriation bond almost always includes a second sum of
credits reserved to send communication to the unit in the field,
telling them that the ticket has been voided by the employer’s
removal. This also pays for transport out of the field if necessary,
and sanctions their immediate evacuation from the situation. Most
operational authorities will honor the removal of mercenaries that
are no longer ticketed to stay, as it has become commonly good
form to do so.

#### Escape Clause

Added in the case that a mercenary unit wants out of its agreed
duties, this section of a ticket is not as common as one might think.
No employer wants to leave room for a disloyal mercenary unit to
walk out on an unfinished job, but no employee wants to be signed
into an untenable ticket situation either. When an escape clause is
added it normally bears serious repercussions (sometimes in the
form of financial reimbursement) toward the employee. As it in
effect protects the mercenary unit from getting ‘stuck’ in a ticket they
cannot or should not finish, it is up to them to make it worthwhile to
the employers for their time, effort and reputation.

## THE ADMINISTRATION OF A TICKET

Once an employer realises they are in need of a mercenary’s services
they choose who they are going to seek for employment, then
arrange for a meeting with their administrative staff. Some units
have pre-arranged members for the business end of their careers,
calling themselves officers or even legal contractors. There are many
who do not care who they send, just the nearest unit members. It all
depends on the unit, their overall training and how much they care
to get the most out of each ticket.

Once an administration has been arranged, it is generally a short
meeting that takes place in a neutral location. Dinner, jokes and
sometimes drinks will precede a ticket administration. Mercenary
units will sometimes use the environment surrounding the
administration process as a way to squeeze just a few additional
credits out of a potential employer before the ticket is signed.

An administration meeting has three main segments: the offer, the
negotiation, and the closing. Each of these three steps is singularly as
important as the rest and any can be devastating to the mercenary’s
position in the ticket if handled poorly.

#### The Offer

When a potential employer sits down with a mercenary unit
representative to set up a ticket, they already know what they need
the ticket to do and a good idea of what they are willing to pay for it.
If they do not, they have already lost their initial bargaining tool and
the negotiations will assuredly go against them. They must have
their ideas and limits ready or a seasoned mercenary administrator
will take them for all they are worth.

The initial offer for a ticket’s services should be simple enough.
The employer states what they need done and what their initial
ticket compensation package should look like, and hope that the
mercenary accepts it. If the offer is too low, the mercenaries might
walk away from the table disgruntled and offended by the small
offer. If the offer is too high, a mercenary unit might wonder exactly
how dangerous the ticket really is and walk away before they get into
something they cannot handle.

In game terms, when a mercenary administrator sits down to judge
the opening offer of a ticket – to ensure it is good enough, but not

### MMERCENARYERCENARY T TICKETSICKETS

too good – he must throw his Admin skill 8+. Depending on the
Effect of the throw, the mercenary can have a good deal of sway over
the honesty of the Ticket Offer segment of a ticket (see Creating the
Ticket below). The degrees of Effect on this throw are below.

EEffectffect TTicket Offer Adjustment icket Offer Adjustment
1 or lower – 4 DM
2 – 2 DM
3 +0 DM
4 +0 DM
5 +1 DM
6 or more +2 DM

#### The Negotiation

Once the initial offer has been accepted, rejected or otherwise pored
over, the real negotiation over a ticket begins – the terms of the
ticket. This part of the process is where the two sides of the ticket
administration try to adjust the various terms to their benefit. From
something as simple as the amount of monetary compensation
being offered to the length of time the ticket is active, all of these
things are discussed and decided.

Some administrators might gloss over certain details in favors of
others, but everyone is obviously interested in getting their way.
This is where an employer can lose a mercenary if they are too strict
and are not willing to meet the unit’s terms. The mercenary can also
lose their chance at the ticket if they do not bend enough to meet
the employer’s wishes. It can be very tense for the administration
teams, especially if they feel that they are getting the short end of the
deal. It is not often that a ticket is simply offered and then signed,
and many mercenaries train their administration officers explicitly to
make the most of each and every ticket they sit down to negotiate.

In game terms, the negotiation process requires both primary
administrators (the employer and the employee) to throw their
Broker skill. If the employer’s result is higher than the mercenary’s,
then the ticket is more or less arranged as the employer needs it to
be, and all of the tables used to generate a mercenary ticket (see
Creating the Ticket below) are rolled normally, with no modifiers. If
the mercenary administrator manages to roll a higher overall result
than the employer, his Effect is compared to the table below. This
shows just how much sway the mercenaries have in creating the
ticket and adjusting it according to their wishes. Ticket adjustments
are discussed further later in this chapter.

EEffectffect NNumber of Ticket Adjustmentsumber of Ticket Adjustments
1 or lower 1d6
2 1d6+1
3 1d6+2
4 1d6+3
52d6
6 or more 2d6+2

The negotiation process is a back and forth process that can take
several hours, but it is generally up to the mercenary administrators
as to exactly how far they want to push the ticket’s limits – the
employer needs them, after all, and not necessarily vice versa.

#### The Closing

The final part of any ticket administration, the closing portion of
the meeting – even if it is an electronic one – is always a very tense
few moments. The employer does not want to say or do anything
that might jeopardise the ticket at the last minute. The mercenary
representative wants to make sure that he does not give the
impression to the employer that his unit will not do the best it can
to finish the ticket. Everyone wants to walk away from the meeting
happy, or at least satisfied the job will be done and paid for.

There is no real game mechanic for leaving an administration
properly, but so long as the mercenary does not do anything
unforeseen that might tip of an employer to shoddy work, everything
should go as planned.

### MERCENARY TICKETS

## CREATING THE TICKET

Whether it is because of player actions during a session, or simply
because a Referee wants to arrange a mission for his players behind
the scenes, the ability to roll up a mercenary ticket is an important
part of this sourcebook.

This section covers the process of building a mercenary ticket step
by step. From the first details to the final arrangements, this section
shows how these missions are created.

#### STEP ONE – WORKING OUT THE EMPLOYER DETAILS

It may seem obvious that the employer of a mercenary ticket would
be listed plainly and honestly, but it is not always the case. Some
employers are purposefully shady in their listings, and only through
the mercenary’s scrutiny can they be discovered.

The Referee may choose or roll randomly upon the table below to
show the amount of detail an employer will place inside the ticket.

The above information is considered privileged for the Referee unless
the mercenary administrator involved chooses to research it further.
The costs the administrator one Ticket Adjustment to research,
and takes an Admin throw 7+ to know the status of the employer’s
true details. Knowing these details will not allow the mercenary to
actually change anything, but it will give them insight as to who they
are dealing with and whether they really wish to proceed.

#### STEP TWO – INCLUDING THE EMPLOYEE DETAILS

This segment of the ticket is completely in the hands of the
mercenary administrator. The employer might request specific
pieces of information, but it is truly up to the mercenary unit what
they include. Some tickets might seem too amoral or high-profile for
a mercenary unit just looking to make the paycheque, allowing them
to work without the social stigma.

The amount of information about the mercenary unit listed on a
ticket is up to the individual administrator. If the unit does not want
to include all of the information about itself, it simply does not.
Omitting any information about the unit on the ticket costs the unit
administrator one Ticket Adjustment.

If the unit wishes to be completely up front and honest, including
all pertinent unit information freely, they instead receive a bonus
Ticket Adjustment – it is easier to negotiate with an employer when
they trust your unit.

#### STEP THREE – SERVICE REQUIRED

The largest portion of any ticket, creating the service section is a
huge multi-segment process that often fills pages of the contract
document. Even though the employer will have all of this information
already in mind, the mercenary unit can negotiate a few of the terms
here and there to better suit their skills.

#### EMPLOYER DETAILS

2 2D6 ResultD 6 Result EEmployer Detailsmployer Details
2 Employer is trying to remain anonymous and use false nomenclature to protect itself.
3 – 5 Employer is purposefully vague on important details.
6 – 8 Employer is perfectly honest in the ticket, but details are little more than title and mode of communication.
9 – 10 Honest details; including the employing agent’s name and direct communication.
11 Honest and very detailed information about the employer.
12 Private Ticket; employer is honest – but is willing to pay extra to keep the information secret.

#### Outside Administration

Even if an entire player group of mercenaries is running missions
in Traveller , they might want to simply let someone else in the
unit do all of the ticket administration. They can let a different
unit member do all of the negotiating in order to simply run the
ticket’s services and get paid.

If a player unit decides to allow this form of ‘outside
administration’ to create tickets for them, they will obviously be
unable to accumulate Ticket Adjustments for the ticket creation
process. In this situation they are at the mercy of their unit’s
administrators, and must abide by what they negotiate.

Any ticket that is administrated by outside forces is given 1d6-1
Ticket Adjustments during the creation process.

#### Ticket Adjustments

Whether gained through the characters’ terms of mercenary
service or through the administration process, Ticket
Adjustments are what allow them to make the most of the ticket.
They are, in essence, the only amount of control the players have
over the random creation process of a mercenary ticket.

Throughout the ticket creation process, there will be several
places where the expenditure of a Ticket Adjustment will affect
the final form of the ticket. The Referee should keep a constant
tally of how many Ticket Adjustments the players use during the
process.

### MMMEERCENARYERRCCEENNAARRYY T TTIICKETSICCKKEETTSS

In game mechanics, there are several sub-steps the Referee must
go through in order to create exactly what sort of services the ticket
requires. These sections are detailed collectively under the heading
of Services. Anytime during this process, unless otherwise noted,
the mercenary unit can expend Ticket Adjustments to move the
result of any random roll upon the tables below up or down one
increment.

The following sub-steps should be completed in the order they are
written.

#### 3.1 GENERIC SERVICE TYPE

There are several overall types of work that a mercenary unit can
fill a ticket for. The Referee can either choose or roll randomly on
the table below to determine this. For this roll, the administrating
character’s Rank is added to the result.

2 2d6 Resultd 6 Result GGeneric Service Typeeneric Service Type

3 Cadre
4 Cadre
5 Commando

12 Warmonger
13 or higher Dream

Once the Generic Service Type has been determined, the next step
is to figure out the exact nature of the ticket’s mission. The varied
sub-types of mission are rolled randomly on the individual Service
tables below, the descriptions of all mission categories are listed
after all of the tables.

#### Mission Definitions

The following are brief descriptions of what each mission type
means to the categories that they could theoretically be assigned
to. These descriptions are by no means the only reasons and
circumstances these missions could take place, but it should give
the Referee a good place to start for their common tickets. Following
each description in parenthesis is also what Length of Service table
will be used in the following sub-section, as well.

AActive Duty: ctive Duty: The mission assigns the mercenary unit to serve on
a battlefield that is currently home to some sort of military conflict.
(LONG)

- _Cadre_ missions of this type tend to be ‘hands on’ training runs
    that let the mercenary unit help one side of the conflict learn
    how to survive and hopefully be victorious.
       - _Commando_ missions in active duty roles tend to be simple fill-
          in positions for regular military units.
       - _Security_ units placed in active duty are used to protect important
          battlefield assets or personalities.

AAssassination: ssassination: The mission involves the killing of a specific target
or targets. (SHORT)

- _Criminal_ missions of this kind are unsanctioned murders, plain
    and simple.
- _Guerrilla_ units sent to assassinate someone are almost always
    targeting the head of a company, governmental office or rival
    force in the way of the employer’s progress.

CCommerce: ommerce: This Warmonger -only mission type is used to describe
a ticket that revolves around the sale of specific goods or services in
a hostile area, or to a hostile client. Including arms deals, smuggling
and personal contracting, this mission is all about making profits.
(MEDIUM)

CCounter Strike: ounter Strike: This Striker -only mission is the directed use of
force in retaliation for an attack of some kind against the employer.
Paying largely for expedience and rapid-response, these missions
are used normally at the beginning of smaller conflicts before they
become full-fledged wars. (SHORT)

DDefence: efence: This Security -only mission is based around the hiring and
assignment of mercenary personnel to a single location or person,
protecting them from outside harm. This could be a corporate
location, a specific item, or even a travelling starship. (MEDIUM)

EElimination: limination: The mission is based around the active seeking of a
target and destroying it. It could be a location, an item, a group or a
specific piece of information. (SHORT)

- _Commando_ missions of this type frequently are a single piece
    of a larger effort. The unit must destroy a specific target that
    would be helpful to the greater conflict effort.
- _Striker_ units undertaking these missions are frequently targeting
    hard-to-get locations or groups, using their fast insertion
    techniques to deal with the target before any further defences
    can be raised.
- _Dream_ missions of this type are too good to be true. They
    are unguarded targets that the unit must eliminate, and likely
    without too much trouble. The pay is probably too much for
    such an easy job, but few mercenaries ask why.

EEscort: scort: This mission involves the unit going from one point to the
next while defending a specific target from capture or destruction.
(MEDIUM)

- _Security_ units assigned to this mission are likely bodyguards or
    handlers of something or someone worth a great deal to the
    employer.
- _Warmonger_ mercenaries that are escorting items are also
    frequently smuggling the item as well, making sure that the
    target reaches its destination unmolested.
- _Dream_ escorts are much like any other babysitting role, but pay
    immensely well due to the extreme importance of the target to
    the employer.

### MMMEERCENARYERRCCEENNAARRYY T TTIICKETSICCKKEETTSS

FField Exercise: ield Exercise: This mission type involves the mercenary unit
performing some sort of average task in a potential hostile location.
(MEDIUM)

- _Cadre_ units often take groups of recruits or employers out into
    the field to train them in ways that they cannot manage in a
    gym or classroom.
- _Warmonger_ units are sometimes asked to bring their wares out
    directly to those who will put them to use.
- _Dream_ missions of this type send the mercenary unit to a task in
    a utopian area for them, and they can enjoy their environment
    while they fulfil their ticket.

FFirst Strike: irst Strike: This mission type is the preliminary attack of any
conflict, often starting a greater escalation. (SHORT)

- _Guerrilla_ mercenaries that sign on for first strike assignments
    are likely to be making a very public statement about their target
    at the same time.
- _Commando_ units that are given the mission to go on first
    strikes are typically attacking a location with massed firepower
    and military fervour.
- _Striker_ units on these missions are tactical offensive groups
    that hit hard, fast and without pause. Their targets rarely have a
    chance to defend themselves and employers expect a great deal
    of momentum and efficiency.
- _Dream_ missions of this type are rarely difficult for the unit and
    target unknowing and lightly defended targets that are extremely
    important to the employer – making them high-paying and low-
    risk.

RRaid: aid: This mission type is used to specifically cause financial
damage to the target. (SHORT)

- _Criminal_ missions of this type are often planned as thefts,
    vandalism or arson.
- _Commando_ units that are given raid missions are sent in to a
    location to cause as much collateral damage as they can while
    performing their maneuvers. They are supposed to go in,
    inflict mass damage, and then quickly evacuate.
- _Warmonger_ missions of this type are aimed at rivals of the
    employer, taking assets from them in order to weaken the
    target’s position against them.

RRecon: econ: This mission involves gathering information on the target.
(MEDIUM)

- _Guerrilla_ units on recon duty are secretly learning about the
    target to likely use it as part of an attack or offensive against it
    later.
- _Cadre_ mercenaries that sign up for these missions are in charge
    of showing others the best way to gather intelligence upon the
    target.
- _Striker_ missions of this type are designed to get into hostile
    territory and learn as much as the mercenaries can, by whatever
    means necessary, before making a hasty escape with the
    information.
- _Dream_ assignments in a recon mission are ‘cushy’ jobs that
    involve non-hostile targets. They are often personal in nature

to the employer, and the mercenaries are being paid for their
subtlety instead of their firepower.

RRetrieval: etrieval: This Commando -only mission type involves a heavily
armed unit going into enemy territory with guns blazing and
engines hot in order to find, obtain and evacuate with the target.
These are frequently used in military situations when prisoners are
involved, but governmental hands are too politically tied to take
action. (MEDIUM)

SSabotage: abotage: This mission type involves the wilful tampering or even
destruction of items or locations belonging to the target. (SHORT)

- _Criminal_ missions of this type are almost always aimed at
    the local operational authorities, otherwise they would not be
    considered criminal in nature.
- _Guerrilla_ units signing on to commit acts of sabotage are likely
    to do so in dramatic and showy way.

TTechnological Test: echnological Test: This Dream mission involves the mercenary
unit being equipped with a brand new and untested piece of
equipment that they are to give field testing for. Whether it is a new
type of armor, weapon, or something as mundane as a new type of
environ-tent, the unit is paid well to do research into the usefulness
of the item. NOTE: This mission grants the mercenary administrator
2d3 additional Ticket Adjustments for use solely in the Post-Ticket
Support section of the ticket. (LONG)

TTerrorise: errorise: This Guerrilla -only mission is the application of violence
and fear to make some kind of political or social statement on
behalf of the employer. This is sometimes considered to be a truly
despicable ticket type, but pays very well for a surprisingly low
amount of work. (MEDIUM)

TTrain: rain: This Cadre -only mission involves the mercenaries staying on
a base, ship, or compound where they will be helping the target
learn whatever skills the employer specifies. This is a very safe ticket
to undertake, but most mercenaries also find them excruciatingly
boring and frustrating. (MEDIUM)

UUnlawful Aquisition: nlawful Aquisition: This Criminal mission type is the basic idea
of picking something up for the employer that does not currently
belong to them. Whether it is simple theft, hijacking, kidnapping or
some other form of ‘acquisition’, the unit must take possession of
the target and bring it to the employer. (SHORT)

#### 3.2 LENGTH OF SERVICE

The ticket’s services are always of a specifically defined length
of time, otherwise the mercenary unit could theoretically be
contractually obligated forever. It is through the negotiation process
that the timing of the contract is worked out.

The following three tables are designed to quickly determine how
long the mercenary unit will be given to fulfil the ticket’s services.
The mercenary administrator may lengthen or shorten the time
increment rolled by spending Ticket Adjustments, one per level

### MMEERCENARYRCENARY TTIICKETSCKETS

moved up or down. Additionally, the administrator can spend
three Ticket Adjustments to change the ticket mission’s base _table_
completely (such as from Short to Long.).

Unless the mercenary administrator specifically includes an
‘end of mission’ clause (which costs the administrator a Ticket
Adjustment), the unit will not actually receive their Compensation
Package until the determined time has expired. Most employers
might be convinced to sway this if proof of a successful ticket can be
shown, but they are not legally required to do so unless this clause
is included. For longer term contracts that run into several months
or more it is not unusual for an employer to pay on a monthly basis
in arrears. There are few mercenary companies that can afford to
pay salaries and upkeep whilst in the field for months at a time with
no income coming in.

#### 3.3 TICKET EXPOSURE

The actions taking place within the service requirements of a ticket
can sometimes be hard on the public eye, or they could elevate a
mercenary’s reputation, depending on what the employer requires
them to do. A unit could want to stay more or less anonymous to
the public on certain tickets; it is their reputation on the line, not the
employer’s, when the media gets to telling the story.

The Referee can use the following table to determine the type of
exposure the ticket’s activities will get. The mercenary administrator
can spend Ticket Adjustments to raise or lower the result by +/– 1
per Ticket Adjustment.

2 2d6 Resultd 6 Result PPublic Exposureublic Exposure
2 or lower Hidden – Without doing research, no one
knows the ticket existed.
3 – 4 Obscure – Only the local public is aware of
the ticket’s actions.
5 – 6 Low Profile – Much of the planet is aware
of the ticket’s actions, and the local public
know the name of the mercenary unit.
7 – 8 Uncommon – The ticket has received some
media attention in the local area and the
mercenary unit’s involvement is locally
public.
9 – 10 Common – The media has spread the
mercenary unit’s name throughout the
planet and it has spread to neighboring
planets.
11 – 12 Exposed – The mercenary unit’s name is
publicly known on a planetary level; even
a few specific members’ names are being
said.
13 or
higher

High Profile – The ticket and the mercenary
unit are being talked about throughout the
system. At least one member of the unit is
being named specifically.

There are a few minor adjustments that are automatically applied
to the table above:

- Any _Criminal_ missions have a –3 to their exposure.
- Any _Guerrilla_ missions have a –2 to their exposure.
- Any _Warmonger_ missions have a –1 to their exposure.
- Any _Dream_ missions have a +2 to their exposure.

### MMERCENARYERCENARY T TICKETSICKETS

#### 3.4 DETERMINE TARGET

The purpose of a ticket’s service, no matter what it might be, will
have a target detailed for the unit to interact with. The various
missions a ticket could arrange for can have one of three types of
target; defensive, neutral and offensive. The following lists explain
what missions can roll on which target tables, which are located
below.

DDefensive Target Missions: efensive Target Missions: Active Duty, Defence, Escort,
Retrieval, Train
NNeutral Target Missions: eutral Target Missions: Commerce, Defence, Field Exercise,

The mercenary administrator can adjust the result of the target table
one increment up or down by spending two Ticket Adjustments.

#### 3.4B – TARGET TYPE DESCRIPTOR

All ticket targets should have a more specific type of descriptor that
helps the Referee work out the exact nature of the service, which can
be chosen or rolled randomly on the table below.

### MMEERCENARYRCENARY TTIICKETSCKETS

#### TARGET DESCRIPTORS

(^1) Roll again for further descriptor, ignoring the same result.
Political targets are directly affiliated with a governmental office,
authority or institution.
Military targets are owned, operated, or inhabited by a military
organization or mercenary unit.
Civilian targets are privately owned, or have no known affiliation
with a governmental source.
Commercial targets are involved with traders, corporations and
their wares.
Mobile targets are anything that is not stationary; making them
more difficult to track down and interact with.
Alien targets are anything that comes from an alien culture, territory
or species.

#### 3.5 DETERMINE RISK

Not necessarily known to the mercenary unit upon the ticket, the
relative danger of the mission can directly affect the survivability
of the ticket. Simple missions pay less, but are nothing to worry
about; more difficult ones are where the money – and the medical
bills – is at.

Referees can choose or roll upon the following table to determine
the level of risk involved with the ticket (and the payment increase
involved). This is kept secret by the Referee, but a mercenary
administrator can choose to spend a Ticket Adjustment to learn the
results.

#### TICKET RISK

1 1d6 Resultd 6 Result LLevel of Riskevel of Risk PPay Grade Adjustmentay Grade Adjustment
1 Too Easy – This is well beneath the unit’s level of training; it is unlikely they will
even break a sweat.

2 Easy – This ticket will not cost the unit much in the way of resources or stress. -1 Increment
3 Average – This is what the unit is trained for, and should serve as a good reminder
what ticket work should be.

###### –

4 Worthy Test – This is a fantastic place to test the unit’s skills, even some of the
obscure ones. They might suffer some wounds or even casualties.

+1 Increment

5 Difficult – This ticket will be a tough one for the whole unit, and the members will
need to be diligent in their training or they might not make it back home.

+2 Increments

6 Arduous – This mission is a nightmare. If anyone makes it back in one piece, they
will have been pushed to the very limit.

+3 Increments

Once the level of risk has been determined, the ticket’s service has
been fully described. The Referee can then use the various pieces
that he has chosen or rolled to put together a cohesive idea of what
the mercenaries will be doing to earn their money.

#### STEP FOUR – PRE-TICKET SUPPORT

Now knowing what exactly the ticket is going to require out of the
mercenary unit, they can ask about receiving some support from
the employer before they undertake it. This is common practice, and
although it might reduce their actual compensation package, it is
often seen as needed.

The mercenary administrator can either spend a number of Ticket
Adjustments to add Pre-Ticket Support, rolling once for each on the
table below, or they can throw Broker 9+ to add a single result from
the table without spending the Ticket Adjustment. A ticket can only
have one instance of each type of support, re-rolling duplicates.

### MMEERCENARYRCENARY TTIICKETSCKETS

As a note, if a mercenary administrator specifically waives any Pre-
Ticket Support, he may increase the Pay Grade of the Compensation
Package by +1 Increment.

#### STEP FIVE – POST-TICKET SUPPORT

When the ticket is finished and finalised, the mercenary unit
returning for their payments, there could be some special services
needed. These are added to the ticket in the form of Post-Ticket
Support. Each roll on the following table cost the mercenary
administrator a Ticket Adjustment. Alternatively, the Referee can
choose to automatically add one roll from the table on behalf of
the employer – an effort to reduce cost in exchange for services. A
ticket can only have one instance of each type of support, re-rolling
duplicates.

As a note, if a mercenary administrator specifically waives any Post-
Ticket Support, he may increase the Pay Grade of the Compensation
Package by +1 Increment.

#### STEP SIX – COMPENSATION PACKAGE

Using the information rolled or selected for the ticket thus far, the
Referee can now figure out the base amount in which the ticket is
actually supposed to pay the mercenary unit. This amount, of course,
is subject to a great deal of change depending on the number of
mercenaries active in the unit (dealt with in the Profits section later
in this chapter).

### MMEERCENARYRCENARY TTIICKETSCKETS

The initial pay grade of the Compensation Package is determined
by the mission type and any adjustments made due to ticket
negotiations.

#### PAY GRADE AMOUNTS

GGraderade AAmountmount GGraderade AAmountmount
Ω 5,000 Cr M 1 MCr
0 10,000 Cr N 1.5 MCr

J 400,000 Cr X 30 MCr
K 500,000 Cr Y 40 MCr
L 750,000 Cr Z 50 MCr

The mercenary administrator can choose to augment the Pay Grade
by spending Ticket Adjustments, at a ratio of two adjustments per
Pay Grade.

Any ticket that has a final Pay Grade of ‘F’ or higher qualifies for a
potential bonus in its compensation package. By willingly reducing
the Pay Grade by one increment and spending a Ticket Adjustment,
the mercenary administrator can roll once (and once only!) on the
special compensation bonus table below.

PPrime Ticket: rime Ticket: The employer will grant the equivalent to the Prime

#### STEP SEVEN – REPATRIATION BOND

Almost every ticket includes these insurance clauses in case the
employer (or their need for the ticket) is eliminated. These clauses
keep a mercenary’s expenditures lower in the unlikely case of an
employer’s willing or unwilling removal from the ticket.

The Referee rolls upon the following table to determine the amount
of the Compensation Package funds (cash only, no bonuses) will be
paid to the mercenary unit in case the employer is forced to abandon
the ticket. The mercenary administrator can adjust the result one
increment by spending a Ticket Adjustments.

evacuation costs.

#### STEP EIGHT – ESCAPE CLAUSE

Although they may not be part of every ticket contract, some
mercenaries may wish to include an escape clause. The actual
terms of the clause are dependant on whether or not the mercenary
administrator cares to debate over them at all. If the mercenaries
want to have an escape clause added, the administrator must spend
a Ticket Adjustment to earn a single roll upon the table below.

### MMMEERCENARYERRCCEENNAARRYY T TTIICKETSICCKKEETTSS

#### ESCAPE CLAUSE LEVELS

2 Below Average - The mercenaries must return
any Pre-Ticket Support, and must pass an
Advocate throw 8+ or be fined 1d6 x 5,000
credits.
3 Average - The mercenaries must return any Pre-
Ticket Support, and must pass an Advocate

4 Above Average – The mercenaries must
return their Pre-Ticket Support.
5 Good – The mercenaries can pass an
Advocate throw 8+ to avoid giving back any
Pre-Ticket Support.
6 Perfect - The mercenaries are allowed to back
out of the ticket without any repercussion.

#### STEP NINE – SEAL THE TICKET

When the negotiations are done and the details of the ticket are
finished, the local governing authorities often request that the
finalised ticket contract is ‘sealed’. Sealing a ticket means that it has
been closed from the negotiations and is considered to be enacted
for all purposes, including the legal bondage of the employer. The
authorities hold on to the ticket, keeping it from the public eye and
record until after the ticket has been fulfilled.

Some mercenaries might want to keep their ticket completely
private, risking the wrath of the operational authorities in order to
hide their activities from all parties. If this is the case, not only will
the mercenary administrator need to spend a Ticket Adjustment

- but he will also have to succeed in a Broker throw 8+.

## USING THE TICKET SYSTEM

The ticket creation system is detailed and unique in how it functions,
but it has several distinct uses for the _Traveller_ system. Referees and
players alike can use the ticket system for their games in order to
enhance its mercenary aspects.

This section explains some of the ways this chapter can be used in
_Traveller_ games.

#### Random Mission Generation

The ticket creation system can be used by Referees not only to
generate work for their mercenary Player Characters. It can also be
used very quickly like a random encounter table of sorts for _Traveller_
games. When a Referee wants to randomly create a short mission
for their game, not even specifically for mercenary-based groups,
they can use step three to determine what sort of interesting events
the player group could get involved with.

We encourage every Traveller Referee to try using this system at
least once to see how it works for them, and an impromptu mission
can be exactly what a player group needs to get involved in greater
plots.

#### Mercenary Plotlines

Although the main use of tickets for a primarily mercenary group
of players is obviously used to make money, a crafty Referee could
easily build an entire story arc off the actions of a particularly
lengthy ticket. With some tickets stretching out over years, a group
of players placed on the actions of a specific ticket could have an
entire campaign’s worth of adventures and excitement trying to
fulfil them. Even if it is just used as a gateway to larger plots and
schemes that the players learn about during the course of the ticket,
a simple ticket could serve a Referee as a storyline device.

Most mercenary-laden games in Traveller will revolve around the
creation and execution of tickets; why not make them serve the
greater story as well as keep the players interested?

#### Downtime Activities

In Traveller , the progression of characters and storylines can take
months and years instead of the common chronological paths that
other roleplaying games might take. A slow starship journey across
the stars could take a great deal of time, or perhaps a training class
might eat up a few months of the characters’ time. Whatever the
reason, Player Character groups could find themselves with great
amounts of downtime. For characters involved in a mercenary unit,
downtime can end as quickly as they can arrange for a ticket to work
upon.

A group of Player Characters could find themselves with some
additional time outside of the normal gaming window, especially
in a group that has a few mercenaries waiting around for their non-
merc allies to be done with their activities. If a Referee wishes to do
so, these mercenary characters could take on a short ticket in order
to make some money while they wait.

## TICKET RESOLUTION – NARRATIVE

## OR SUMMARY?

There are two main ways to utilise the services of a ticket; narrative
format and summary format. Both have their strengths and
weaknesses to the players and Referee, which are covered here.

#### Narrative Resolution Format

The fairest and most enjoyable format of ticket resolution for a
gaming session, a Traveller ticket played in Narrative form runs it as
a string of scenarios and adventurous events. The Referee plans out
all of the encounters he wishes to take place, maps out the course
of the adventure, and creates individual Non-Player Characters to
interact with, and so on. Essentially, this format has the Referee turn
the ticket into a fully designed scenario.

### MERCENARY TICKETS

This format can be very time consuming for the Referee, and
essentially sets the stage for as many gaming sessions as it takes to
finish or abandon the ticket (if possible). It is a great way to quickly
create the storyline for a few sessions, and allows for the individual
Player Characters to utilise their skills and perhaps finish a ticket
spectacularly well.

Although not as expedient as simply creating the summary of a
ticket and adjusting the timeline of the game, Narrative format is far
more detailed and fair to the representation of the Player Characters’
actual skills and talents.

#### Summary Resolution Format

The simpler of the two forms of ticket resolution, Summary format
is actually a series of die rolls and skill throws made by the Referee

and involved Player Characters to determine what the results of the
ticket’s mission were. This method is fast and simple, getting the
Player Characters paid in a rapid fashion in order to move the overall
story along. Essentially the Referee rules that the ticket is undertaken
between gaming sessions, the chronology of the gaming setting is
moved forward as the ticket dictates, and the characters are paid
(and perhaps in need of medical care).

This method is a great deal less exciting than knowing exactly what
happened during the ticket, but is more useful for player groups
that are not all members of the mercenary unit, or when mercenary
characters just want to make some extra money on the side. Referees
should be careful to note that this format could be overused by some
mercenaries, making too much money for too little risk.

#### An Example Ticket Creation

The following is an example of how a ticket is created. Any dice rolls or game mechanic adjustments are placed in brackets, while the
narrative game explanation is written normally.

A small unit of mostly Strikers sends their administrator, Bariael, to an interested party’s offices in order to negotiate an upcoming employment
ticket. When Bariael arrives at the office, he is introduced to the general idea of the ticket, and is quite pleased with what he has found [ Admin
throw of 9 + 2 (skill DM) = 11; gaining +1 DM on the Negotiation ].

The Negotiation process goes well enough over a few stiff drinks [ Broker throw of 6 + 1 (Offer bonus) + 3 (skill DM) = 10; this is better than
the employer’s 8, earning Bariael 7 Ticket Adjustments (1d6+1) }, and he sits down to hear what they need done.

The employer, seems up front about their details [ Honest Details ], so Bariael sees no reason to try and hide who they are either [ +1 Ticket
Adjustment ]. The ticket will show that they legally were hired to fill the services, and that is good enough for him.

The ticket explains that Bariael’s team will need to move quickly [ rolling a 3 on the Medium Mission length table; 5 weeks! ] and retrieve
[ rolled a 4 on the Commando Mission table, but spent one Ticket Adjustment to make it a Retrieval mission instead ] an exposed [ rolled
an 11 on Exposure ] military ally of the employer [ rolled a 2 on Defensive Targets, spent one Ticket Adjustment to make it an Allied
Individual; then tolled a 2 on Target Descriptors ]. Seeing as the job seems dangerous, Bariael digs deep [ spending a Ticket Adjustment ] and

##### learns that the mission will indeed be very difficult [ the Referee rolled a 5 on Target Risk ], adding more fuel to his debate for higher pay

Bariael decides to get more out of the employer, now he knows how dangerous the mission will be [ spending two Ticket Adjustments to gain
Pre-Ticket Support ]. He barters 40,000 credits in liquid funds [ roll of 5 on Advance Funds ] and full repairs of all their gear [ rolled a 3 on
Services ]. He also wants to have some additional help waiting for them when they are done [ spends one Ticket Adjustment to roll upon the
Post-Ticket Support table ], and the employer agrees to set the unit up on one of their touring pleasure yachts when they return [ rolled a 1 on
Post-Ticket Support ].

The actual compensation package for the ticket was originally not that high for such a risky job [ Grade C + 1 (Target) + 2 (Risk) – 3 (Support
Negotiation) }, but Bariael talks them up slightly higher, arranging for 75,000 credits to be paid upon completion [ spends two Ticket
Adjustments to increase to Grade D ].

Adding the obligatory Repatriation Bond of 50% payment upon cancellation including emergency evacuation [ rolled a 4 and 5 ] , the ticket
is almost complete. As an aside, knowing that they might be biting off more they can chew, Bariael adds in the need for an Escape Clause
[ spending his last Ticket Adjustment ] in case things get just a little too hectic for his team. Of course, there will be legal ramifications if he
does [ rolled a 2 on Escape Clause Levels ], but he is still satisfied with the final arrangement.

The ticket is done and ready to be enacted. The employer is satisfied, Bariael has signed off on his team’s part, and the ticket paperwork has been
sealed and shipped off to the necessary authorities for safekeeping while the Strikers do what they do best...

### MMMEERCENARYERRCCEENNAARRYY T TTIICKETSICCKKEETTSS

A ticket can be resolved in a Summary using the following steps:

- Step One – Each ticketing member throws one related skill
    (chosen by Referee) at 8+.
- Each failure must roll on the Ticket Mishap Table (below).
- Step Two – Each ticketing member must throw Endurance
    8+ or Social 9+.
- Failing the Endurance throw earns the character a roll on the
    Injury Table (see _Traveller_ core rulebook, page 37)
- Failing the Social throw earns the character a Rival or Enemy
    (Referee’s choice).
- Step Three – Unit rolls on Ticket Event Table (below).

As a note, larger mercenary units do better in most cases than
smaller ones when it comes to conflicts. For every full 10 members
of the unit active for the ticket, one Player Character member can
ignore Step One or Step Two of the above process.

#### TICKET MISHAP TABLE

PPersistent Enemies: ersistent Enemies: The character finds himself targeted by

Endurance or Social roll in Step Two has a -2 DM.

BBad Media Coverage: ad Media Coverage: The character is shown in a particularly bad
light on the local media coverage, and word has spread about the
negativity surrounding him. He must decrease his Social Standing
by 1 immediately.
PPersonal Loss: ersonal Loss: The character lost something important to him
(weapon, jewellery, etc.) during the ticket. This item is chosen by
the Referee, and should be something that the character would have
had with them during the ticket.

Once a ticket has been resolved, the Referee will need to adjust the
game’s chronological placement (after taking the ticket’s length
into account) and work out the final profitability of the ticket for
the unit.

## TICKET PROFITABILITY

After a ticket has been finished and the unit returns from its location,
they will be expecting to get paid. Legally bound to receive their
pay, the mercenary unit must then divide their compensation into
several pieces, paying various other sources of aid before figuring
out their final profits.

#### Reductions

After a mercenary unit is paid for their work on a given ticket,
the higher echelons of the unit’s staff will take charge of making
sure that all of the appropriate fees and wages get paid out of the
initial sum before the unit members actually get paid. This rapidly
depletes the compensation from a ticket, but it keeps everything in
working order. These reductions in the ticket wage are a necessary
expenditure for a unit that wants to remain active, and even criminals
tend to pay them.

The following Reductions are removed (if applicable) from the base
monetary Compensation Package of the ticket, creating the final
Profit Margin.

#### TICKET EVENT TABLE

12 Impressive! – The unit excels at the ticket and the employer is impressed, adding a +10% to the monetary
amount of the Compensation Package of the ticket.

### MERCENARY TICKETS

#### REDUCTION ONE – TRANSPORT

Transport costs for a unit that has to travel through space to and
from the operational area are usually covered separately by the
patron. The very high costs of moving personnel between different
systems tend to disproportionately increase the prices of tickets if
included, so the whole process is resolved independently from the
ticket pricing system. However, it has become standard practice for
the ticket provider to recover some of the cost from the mercenary
unit, effecting their final payday.

If a mercenary unit uses its own transport the employer will usually
cover all the transit costs as it will be cheaper than contracting out
the transportation to a third party. Employers are very careful to
ensure they are not overcharged, especially if the mode of transport
is out of all proportion to the mercenary unit hired.

This amount, unless previously covered within the services section
of the ticket, is based upon the overall Compensation Package. The
amount is fluctuating in order to get the most out of bigger units,
but also to help starting mercenary units from going bankrupt trying
to get from place to place in order to work.

The Reduction for transport is set as a basic 1d6%, but has
modifiers depending on the size of the unit and equipment being
transported.

- +1% for every 10 unit members being transported
- +1% for every vehicle being transported
- +1% for every 25 passengers (allies, non-unit personnel and so
    on)
- +3% if being transported into actively hostile territory
- +5% is Emergency Evacuation is required

WWhat Eliminates this Reduction: hat Eliminates this Reduction: Owning sufficient transport,
using personal sources, ticket support choices, local ticket.

#### REDUCTION TWO – EQUIPMENT UPKEEP

A mercenary unit will want to ensure that all gear that was used
during the ticket mission is up to ready status after the ticket is
over. When they have the money to do so, they will pay for necessary
repairs and the like. With the ever-changing market for mercenaries
always threatening to send them on another ticket, they should keep
their gear ready to use at a moment’s notice.

The Reduction for equipment upkeep is set as a basic 1d6+1%, but
has modifiers depending on the technological level and types of
gear used by the unit.

- –1% for a non-combat ticket
- +1% for every 25 unit members on ticket
- +1% for using equipment with a TL higher than TL11
- +1% for every vehicle used
- +1% for a unit using Battle Dress
- +2% for a unit that actively used Field Artillery or Artillery Battle
    Dress

WWhat Eliminates this Reduction: hat Eliminates this Reduction: Access to sufficient upkeep
workshops and equipment, ticket support choices.

#### REDUCTION THREE – MEDICAL FEES

There are few tickets out there that will not subject the mercenary
unit to at least some kind of dangerous situation or conflict – or
the employer would simply go with a simpler solution. This means
that the mercenary unit will invariably see combat, and will likely
suffer at least minor injuries here and there to its members. The unit
will seek medical attention for its more seriously wounded, and the
money to pay for such services are taken out of the impending ticket
fees as a standard of procedure.

The Reduction for medical fees is set as a basic 1d6–1%, but has
modifiers depending on the number of unit members possibly
injured, and the threat level of the mission.

- –3% for a non-combat ticket
- –1% for a unit that uses Battle Dress armor
- +1% for every 10 active unit members on the ticket
- –2% for a unit that actively used unit members with at least
    Medic 1
- –3% for a ticket assessed at a _Too Easy_ level of risk

### MMMEERCENARYERRCCEENNAARRYY T TTIICKETSICCKKEETTSS

- –1% for a ticket assessed at _an Easy_ level of risk
- +1% for a ticket assessed at _a Worthy Test_ level of risk
- +2% for a ticket assessed at _a Difficult_ level of risk
- +3% for a ticket assessed at _an Arduous_ level of risk

WWhat Eliminates this Reduction: hat Eliminates this Reduction: Not suffering wounds or
casualties, ticket support choices.

#### REDUCTION FOUR – AUTHORITY PAYMENTS

When a ticket is sealed for use the local authorities charge a
small amount of taxation upon the funds involved to pay for the
legal backing it will receive. Placing it in the public record requires
attorneys, clerks and a host of computer technicians and the like
who are on the payroll in some way, shape or form. This Reduction
pays the local authorities what they require to do their jobs, and
keeps them from making further problems for an otherwise already
difficult career.

The Reduction for authority payments is set as a basic 1d6%, but has
modifiers depending on the amount of money in the compensation
package.

- –1% for a unit that actively used unit members with at least
    Advocate 2 during ticket administration
- +1% for a Compensation Package ranging between 30,000
  - 99,999 credits
- +2% for a Compensation Package ranging between 100,000
  - 499,999 credits
- +3% for a Compensation Package ranging between 500,000
    credits and 1 Megacredits
- +4% for a Compensation Package over 1 Megacredit

WWhat Eliminates this Reduction: hat Eliminates this Reduction: Anonymous or illegal
ticketing.

#### REDUCTION FIVE – TICKETING COSTS/LIVING EXPENSES

When arranging a ticket there are several minor costs that the
mercenary unit must pay in order to ensure that everything works
smoothly on the back end. Paying for rental spaces for equipment,
storage for vehicles, and housing bills are just some of the things
that take up a few credits kilocredits here and there; these costs
add up. Professional mercenary units take care of these costs out
of each ticket’s compensations in order to stay at peak efficiency
between missions.

The Reduction for ticketing costs/living expenses is set as a basic
1d6–2%, but has modifiers depending on the size of the unit and
the number of vehicles they commonly own.

- +1% for every 50 members of the unit
- +1% for every 5 vehicles owned by the unit
- +2% for every compound, office or other structure owned by
    the unit

WWhat Eliminates this Reduction: hat Eliminates this Reduction: Illegal living or storage
arrangements.

#### Calculating Final Profits

Once the Compensation Package from the ticket has had all of
the necessary reductions removed, some 30% of any profit at this
stage is put aside for the mercenary company’s own accounts.
These funds are used to purchase new equipment, recruiting and
training new members and other sundry costs. After this share is
deducted the remaining money is split between the members of the
mercenary unit.

Higher ranking members of the unit are expected to be paid more
than a common grunt, making their share greater. This is considered
a standard practice, and followed universally unless members of a
unit are untrustworthy characters that are willing to try and steal
from their fellow team members.

In game terms, after all applicable Reductions have been subtracted
from the Compensation Package, the mercenary unit adds up all
of their effective members’ Ranks (three Rank 0 members count
for a single Rank 1). The Compensation Package is then divided by
that total number of Ranks, giving the Salary Share amount of wage.
This should amount to only the members that were considered
active on the ticket, but some extremely large mercenary units or
companies might have a special Rank 6 Salary Share that they take
for themselves. If a Referee has not already detailed this information,
a system for randomly generating the size and Ranks of a mercenary
company is included in this book (see Recruiting Unit Members ,
page 60).

The final Salary Share amount is then multiplied by each member’s
individual Rank; the result is their wage from the ticket.

The following example is a continuation of the ticket creation
example earlier in this chapter.

Bariael’s unit has successfully completed the retrieval and is now
working out the details of their payment. The money they received as
pre-ticket support was spent on bribes and expedited transports, so the
unit accountant only has to worry about paying the requisite fees and
paying the fifteen unit members involved in the mission.

The payment plan of 75,000 credits is then subjected to the various
reductions after the ticket. Transport reductions pull 5% (1d6% +
1% +2% = 3,750) to pay for the travel of fifteen unit members to a
hostile place. The unit does not have to pay for equipment upkeep at
all because of Bariael’s cunning negotiation skills (Post-Ticket Support),
but medical reductions for such a dangerous mission amounted to a
total of a further 7% (1d6–1% +1% +2% = 5,250). Authority reductions
came at a negligible 1% (1d6% – 1% +1% = 750) because of Bariael’s
legal training, and the unit got off very light on living expenses at 2%
(1d6–2% + 2% = 1,500) due to their compound’s location. Reducing the
package by 11,250 credits, leaving some 63,750 credits of which 19,125
are then placed into the unit’s pwn bank account leaving the accountant
to split up the remaining 44,625 credits into wages and profits.

### MMEERCENARYRCENARY TTIICKETSCKETS

_The unit consisted of two Rank 3 Strike Leaders, three Rank 2 Strike
Specialists, and ten Rank 1 Squadmates. This makes the Salary Share
wage 2028 credits (3 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1x10 = 22; 44,625_ ÷ _22 = 2028,
rounded down). This means that the Strike Leaders will receive 6,084
credits, the Strike Specialists each receive 4,056 credits, and the
Squadmates get the base amount. This was a rather lucrative ticket,
especially considering they now get to go on a short vacation for some
much needed rest!_

## COSTS OUTSIDE OF TICKETS

Not all mercenary units will want to keep their missions and jobs
on official tickets, even if it is generally in their best interests. Some
will try to keep track of their own finances, pay their members out
of savings, and upkeep equipment and vehicles without using the
conventional ‘out of compensation’ methods. Perhaps a unit has
been out of work for a few months and they simply need to make
sure their rent is paid and their guns have bullets to fire. Whatever
the reasoning, if a unit goes more than six months between tickets,
they will need to arrange to pay for their own upkeep and wages.

This section discusses how to calculate exactly what a mercenary
unit that is taking care of its own accounting will be paying out to
stay functioning.

#### The Process

The actual accounting process is very similar to how the
compensation package of a ticket wage is calculated, except
the amounts are dictated by what is known as the CPM variable

- Cost Per Member. Figuring the CPM is based on the number of
members in the unit, their technology level, their average skill, and
if they have any outside assets to consider. Once the CPM variable
is determined, the calculation of monthly monetary losses (after six
months) is a series of multipliers.

#### STEP ONE – FIGURING THE UNIT’S CPM VARIABLE

Determining the CPM variable of a mercenary unit is a matter of
deciding just how many individual costs a single member of the unit
is likely to consider. This is a very general calculation, but the costs
of running a mercenary unit is often spread throughout the ranks
without their knowledge anyway. Just because a single fire team
has never suffered a casualty does not mean that their wages are
not being affected by the medical fees of those who have. For these
reasons, the CPM variable of a unit must be re-calculated every 6
months if a unit has not used the ticket system.

The base number for a CPM variable is 5. This is then modified by
the series of unit-based checks below. Many of these modifiers will
be determined by the Referee, using rules presented in the Recruiting
Unit Members chapter of this book. It should be noted that the CPM
variable cannot be reduced to less than 2 by any given modifier.

Unit has not seen conflict in past 6 mos. –1
Unit has medics as members –1
Unit keeps HQ on TL7 – TL9 world –2
Unit keeps HQ on TL4 – TL6 world –3

Once the CPM variable is calculated, it must be taken through the
following steps to create a running total of funds that must be paid
monthly to keep the unit in working order.

#### STEP TWO – TRANSPORT MULTIPLIER

Unless the mercenary unit managed to hijack rides or smuggle
themselves on free transports and corsair ships, they will have had
to pay travel fees and the like. Getting around is not free, and few
units can ever hope to stay active on their own planet just to save
money.

The multiplier for transport is listed in credit amounts, creating a
final number that will be multiplied by the unit’s CPM variable. This
creates the cost for the unit’s monthly transport fees.

- 100 credits for every off-planet trip in the past month
- 200 credits if vehicles were transported off-planet in the past
    month
- 50 credits if any unit members travelled with battle dress of any
    kind in the past month
- 200 credits if any unit members had to use emergency
    evacuation transport in the past month

#### STEP THREE – EQUIPMENT UPKEEP MULTIPLIER

Possibly the most expensive part of keeping a mercenary unit
functioning is its equipment costs. Blades need sharpening, guns
need ammo and vehicles need fuel. This is where a unit can go
bankrupt quickly enough. Units that cannot keep their equipment
running will soon be down to knives and sharp sticks to get their
missions completed.

The multiplier for equipment upkeep is listed in credit amounts,
creating a final number that will be multiplied by the unit’s CPM
variable. This creates the cost for the unit’s monthly equipment
upkeep.

- 100 credits if the unit uses equipment with a TL less than TL6
- 200 credits if the unit uses equipment with a TL between TL7
    and TL10
- 500 credits if the unit uses equipment with a TL higher than
    TL11
- 200 credits if the unit commonly uses heavy or support
    weaponry
- 200 credits if the unit uses vehicles
- 400 credits if the unit has a HQ on a TL10 world or higher

#### STEP FOUR – MEDICAL CARE MULTIPLIER

Just because a mercenary unit does not see wartime combat does
not mean that they do not incur other medical care costs. Members
get sick, need augmentation, or otherwise get themselves wounded
in missions – or maybe just training. Medical care is expensive,
and unless a unit works out special deals with a doctor or medical
facility, they will haemorrhage funds.

The multiplier for medical costs is listed in credit amounts, creating
a final number that will be multiplied by the unit’s CPM variable.
This creates the cost for the unit’s monthly medical care bills.

- 100 credits if the unit was involved in a small action (10 or less
    opponents)
- 200 credits if the unit was involved in a notable action (11 to
    100 opponents)
- 500 credits if the unit was involved in a major conflict (101 or
    more opponents)
- 50 credits if unit members have augmentations
- 50 credits if unit members have known conditions or diseases
- 200 credits if unit suffered major wounds or casualties in the
    last 6 months.

#### STEP FIVE –LIVING EXPENSE MULTIPLIER

Every mercenary unit, no matter how big or small, will need a place
to live. The larger the unit, the larger or more numerous these living
quarters will need to be. Communications between member cells
is paramount, and paying all the appropriate taxes upon owned
properties keeps them from getting into legal trouble with their local
authorities. A unit must pay its rent, or they will soon be homeless.

The multiplier for living expenses is listed in credit amounts, creating
a final number that will be multiplied by the unit’s CPM variable.
This creates the cost for the unit’s monthly living expenses.

- 50 credits for every planet the unit has a HQ on
- 100 credits for every starship the unit has a HQ on
- 200 credits for every space station the unit has a HQ on
- 300 credits if the unit has a medical facility at their HQ
- 200 credits if the unit has a starport attached to their HQ
    (planetary only)

#### INTERSTELLAR PASSENGER COSTS

The high costs of interstellar passenger transport would be crippling for many of the smaller mercenary units as they send their agents
(more often than not the owners of the business) out to negotiate tickets away from the world upon which they are based. Fortunately
these mercenaries tend to have skill sets that are highly desirable for merchant vessels looking for protection from pirates and hijackers.
Many of these negotiators will sign on as a working passage when travelling between the stars, almost entirely eliminating the costs by
acting as a gunner or as part of the security detail whilst travelling in a merchant ship or liner.

### MMEERCENARYRCENARY TTIICKETSCKETS

#### Example of Paying Non-Ticket Fees

The following example involves the same unit from earlier in this
chapter; this time they have decided to deal with their own fees
outside of ticket costs.

_Bariael’s unit has taken a few missions off the record recently for a
group of pirates and their expenses have begun to pile up. Looking at
the 34,000 Cr balance in the unit account, Bariael decides to settle up
their debts and look for more hones work._

_Figuring the CPM variable of the unit is easy. Bariael’s unit numbers
sixty members [_ Common; 5+1=6 _], actively uses gauss weaponry [_ TL12;
6+1=7 _], are marginally skilled [_ 7+0=7 _], and have several Psionists at
their HQ on an old industry planet [_ Psionists and TL9 HQ; 7+1–2=6
(final CPM variable) _]._

_The unit took two long trips to the pirate bases for their jobs, and once
had to be pulled out early when things got rough; meaning that Bariael
will need to cover some of these costs to the tune of some 2,400 credits
[_ 100+100+200 = 400 x CPM = 2,400 _]._

_Equipment costs are relatively standard for the month, having never
needed to rent any vehicles or worry about a high-tech headquarters,_

paying a sum of 3,000 Cr [ 500 x CPM = 3,000 ] to the engineers and
ammunition suppliers.

Paying the local doctors and medical suppliers was particularly expensive
this month, as the missions were highly dangerous. Fifty pirate poachers
waited for them on both bases they had to assault, putting a great deal
of stress on their augmented marines, and putting several of them in
the hospital with bad wounds. There total bills summed up to 3,300 Cr
[ 300+50+200=550 x CPM = 3,300 ], which they have to pay or their
members on the mend might not get any better anytime soon.

Thankfully the taxes on their primary HQ are not very high, but their
alternate base set up on a faraway medical station requires a much
larger set of fees – even if it is not used very often. As Bariael wires
another 3,300 Cr [ 50+200+300=550 x CPM = 3,300 ] to the governing
accounts, he wonders if the alternate base is really worth the cost.

Having spent a total of 12,000 Cr [ 2,400+3,000+3,300+3,300 =
12,000 ], leaving the unit account with a meagre 22,000 Cr, he realises
that they had better get a ticket going soon – they can only afford these
bills for another month before they will have to start letting people go!

### RREECRUITINGCRUITING

A mercenary unit is only as good as its members, and they are not
an infinite resource. Members are killed in action, some move onto
other employment and even old age claims a select and lucky few.
To make sure that the unit always has the right number of members
to fulfil their tickets it will recruit replacements and more often than
not using specialist recruiters.

Going to planets in the hopes of finding the right personnel to hire,
recruiters are often charismatic and persuasive in order to get as
many possible recruits from each trip. Recruits will frequently ‘wash
out’ before they can even attain their first rank in the unit, forcing
the recruiters to sign on as many as they can – because they will only
get a few actual recruits out of the endeavor.

This chapter shows readers how to not only send Player Characters
on missions to gather potential new members for their mercenary
units, but also includes rules on how to randomly generate a unit’s
details and the basic statistics for Non-Player Character mercenaries.
It has everything a Referee needs to build a mercenary unit, whether
around a set of Player Characters as co-workers or as foes.

## THE RECRUITING PROCESS

Gathering up potential recruits is not as easy as it sounds to some;
a mercenary cannot just walk down to the nearest marketplace
and set up a kiosk where people will sign up. It is a more in depth
process that requires training, experience, and understanding to
function properly. This is why most mercenary units have specific
delegates that they send on recruiting missions.

A recruiting agent in a mercenary unit will obviously have some
training in the Recruiting skill, and likely some in Admin and
Advocate as well. All of these skills can be useful during the process,
but arguably the most important part of the process is actually
based on location.

#### THE RECRUITING THROW

After all modifiers have been fully calculated (see following sections),
the recruiting officer can throw his Recruiting skill 8+. It will take 1d6
weeks before all the recruits that might be hired can be located. The
Effect measures how many potential recruits agree to try for unit
admission. The table below shows the results.

(^1) This cannot be modified below 0 or above 10 for any reason
No matter the results of the Recruiting throw, the recruiter can
attempt another throw in 1 – 6 weeks _after_ he is finished with the last
round of recruiting. This will take up a great deal of time, but could
be useful if the unit has a few months to spend filling the ranks.
Whatever the recruiting mercenary decides to use as his methods
of doing so, the following are potential modifiers used to alter the
Recruiting throw to add potential new recruits into their mercenary
unit.

#### The Recruitment Site

Where the mercenary chooses to seek out his recruits is as important
as how skilled he might be. A planet’s population, government and
legal limitations can have a serious impact on the number of recruits
that will come forward when the call is sent out.

Each of the following subsections explains how these factors can
adjust the Recruiting throw and its corresponding Effect.

#### PLANETARY POPULATION

The number of people living on a planet has a marked effect upon
the efforts of a recruiting mercenary. If there are not many people
around, the mercenary cannot hope to draw them away from their
lives. Within a larger population there will be plenty of potential
recruits that will be drawn the recruiter’s offer of employment.

Using the planetary Population Digit system from the _Traveller_ core
rulebook, the table shows how a planet’s population will affect
mercenary recruitment. For planets with negligible populations
(level 0 or 1) there will be no chance of any recruits being found
since it is extremely unlikely that any amongst the population will be
both willing and physically able to become a mercenary.

9 (Billions) +4
10 (A) (Tens of billions) +4
11 (B) (Hundreds of billions) +6
12 (C) (Trillions) +6

#### Operational Government

The government in the area from which a recruiter is trying to draw
members from is important to the attitude and agreeability of the
potential recruits. A democracy might give its citizens the freedom
to choose a mercenary’s life, but a Balkanization of warring states
might not take too kindly to mercenaries taking away their new
soldiers.

Using the planetary Government Type system from the Traveller
core rulebook, the table shows how a planet’s overall governing
body will affect mercenary recruitment.

### RREECRUITINGCRUITING

#### Type of Law Enforcement

The way that the local law enforcement policies keep their own
populations safe or in line can have an effect upon the willingness
of the civilians to join into a mercenary unit. If they have been
oppressed by a military force before, or perhaps treated too lightly
to feel militant about anything, they may not want to spend any time
with a group full of soldier types.

Using the planetary Law Level system from the _Traveller_ core
rulebook, the table shows how a planet’s major legal system will
affect mercenary recruitment.

#### Starport Existence

Whether or not a planet has local access to travel into the stars
will vastly affect the populace’s willingness to leave their planet for
extended periods of time. A people who have yet to achieve space
travel, or those who have yet to discover it, are not going to find a
recruiter’s pitch less frightening than what the void might offer.

Using the Starport rules from the _Traveller_ core rulebook, the table
shows how a planet’s major legal system will affect mercenary
recruitment.

#### Base Existence

The galaxy has hundreds, if not thousands, of important bases
situated throughout known space. These bases make recruiting
occasionally difficult, but can be extremely prolific if the mercenary
can manage to get the local staff to allow a recruiting drive to take
place.

Using the rules for adding Bases to a planet from the Traveller core
rulebook, the table shows how a base upon the planet will affect
mercenary recruitment. As a note, there are some bases listed here
that are just good examples of what could exist out in the galaxy.

#### Assessing the Recruits

Once the recruiting mercenary has lined up his possible recruits,
they must then be run through a quick gamut of tests to prove they
can serve even the most simple of roles within the unit. Some are
sent to shooting ranges, others to the mechanics pool, and even
some to the kitchens. If they can find a role for them to fill, they can
become recruits.

Many recruits will be veterans of either the regular armed forces or
of other mercenary units. As long as these individuals are physically
capable of fulfilling roles within the unit they will be swiftly assigned
to where their skills are most needed. This can, on occassion, leave
some overqualified personnel manning some positions, but this
is seen as a good problem to have. These recruits will make up
between half and two thirds of any recruiting class, at the referee’s
discretion, the remainder are raw recruits and have to go through
some basic training before they are found a role within the unit.

There are three different tests with which the potential recruits
can be tested. Each of the following subsections explains how the
Referee or Player Characters will need to use these individual tests
to weed out the less desirable potentials. Whether being directly
trained by the Player Characters or determined by the Referee these
judging methods are the same.

The potential recruits should be divided roughly evenly between the
three tests, with each ‘class’ rolling the specified skill to see how
many pass into Rank 0. If a Player Character with at least Instruction
2 and the necessary skill at level 2 or higher is selected to teach that
portion of the recruits, that class receives a +2 DM to their collective
skill throw for judgment. It should be noted that all raw recruits
should use the statistics for Trainees (found later in this chapter).
The course takes; from between 10 and 60 days.

### RREECRUITINGCRUITING

#### COMBAT TRAINING

The potential recruits are put through a series of combat tests; being
shown how to shoot basic weaponry, defend themselves in close
quarters combat, and use specialist weaponry. This is considered
the generally easiest part of training, especially with a qualified
instructor.

The class must make a Dexterity throw 8+ in order to pass in high
numbers. The following table shows what percentage of the recruits
will pass into Rank 0 depending on the Effect.

#### SUPPORT SKILL TRAINING

The group of recruits are taught several of the basic background skills
that are needed to keep any mercenary unit functioning between
tickets. Ammunition packing, vehicle and weapon maintenance,
and first aid basics are just some of the skills that are shown to
them. The most average of recruits end up in these sorts of classes;
not tough enough for combat or smart enough for office training.

The class must make an Education throw 9+ in order to pass in high
numbers. The following table shows what percentage of the recruits
will pass into Rank 0 depending on the Effect.

#### OFFICE TRAINING

The potential recruits are placed in a classroom and tested for their
aptitude at the office and administration skills required to keep a
unit from falling into bankruptcy. Finances, asset management,

ticket administration and membership paperwork are some of the
assorted tasks that office recruits will need to know if they join the
unit. It is a difficult course to pass, but one that almost guarantees
their success in the unit.

The class must make an Intelligence throw 9+ in order to pass in
high numbers. The following table shows what percentage of the

### RRREECRUITINGECCRRUUIITTIINNGG

#### THE PASSING RECRUITS

Once the classes are over and the instructors have chosen which
recruits are skilled enough to join the unit as trainees, the collective
recruits are gathered together and shipped to wherever the unit’s
base of operations (if any) is. The group is then placed into
further training, undertaking their first official terms as mercenary
members.

#### Recruiting Example

The following is an example of a basic recruitment session.

_The Attalusian 44th is looking to do a recruiting drive on a local planet
they just received the allowance to do so legally. They send their most
knowledgeable recruiter. The planet is populated by hundreds of
thousands [_ +0 DM _] of aliens currently dealing with a captive government
[_ –2 DM _] under nearly martial law (Level 5) [_ +0 DM _]. The planet is lucky
to have a class D starport [+0 DM] attached to a frontier port [+2 DM],
making the most out of the few weeks they are allowed. The recruiter
does a very admirable job, spending only two weeks to find a sizeable
number of willing recruits [_ Recruiting roll of 12 plus a total DM of +0;
a success with an Effect 4 _]._

_The group of recruits is excellent for such a short amount of time,
numbering 24 [_ 5d6 _]. The group is then split into three individual groups
of eight to go into their initial judgment tests. The combat training
group does amazingly well [_ passing with Effect 4; 60% of 8 = 4.8
rounded to 5 recruits _], the support group did as expected [_ passing with
Effect 4; 50% of 8 = 4 recruits _], and the office training course was a
nearly complete failure [_ pssing with Effect 0; 5% of 8 = 0.4 rounded
to 1 recruit _]. The result of the recruiting drive on this planet will end up
with ten Rank 0 recruits, who will ship out to Attalus VI as soon as the
ink on their contracts is dry!_

## BUILDING A MERCENARY UNIT

In _Traveller_ , mercenary units are bonded groups of like-minded
individuals seeking employment and compensation for their work.
They are not very different from any other type of sub-contractor;
save for their work often includes combat and destruction. Just like
there are ten thousand different labour unions for this or that, there
is a massive variety of mercenary units.

This section is written to help Referees flesh out their own mercenary
units rapidly, or help build a unit around his Player Characters. There
are only four steps involved in building a mercenary unit; Size, Fame/
Infamy, Experience and Traits. Each step can be rolled randomly or
chosen by the Referee as he sees fit. If the Player Characters are
founding members, the players should have a great amount of say
in such matters as well.

#### Unit Size

Mercenary units can range from multi-planetary unions that
number in the thousands of active members to small, privately run
five-to-six man elite teams. There is a lot to be said for efficiency in
numbers, especially when massive numbers of bodies are needed
to fill a ticket, but taking 1/500th of the compensation package of a
ticket makes such numbers a problem. A small team might have
more to lose, but the pay is always better. Each unit has to decide its
comfortable level of members, and adjust its ticketing accordingly.

Referees can roll or choose on the table below to determine the
size category of the mercenary unit, detailing the number of active
members and the maximum number of members that can be sent
on a normal ticketed mission.

#### MERCENARY UNIT SIZE

2 2d6 Resultd 6 Result SSize Categoryize Category NNumber of Membersumber of Members

7 Common 10 – 60 (1d6 x 10)
8 – 9 Large 20 – 120 (2d6 x 10)
10 Legion 100 – 600 (1d6 x 100)
11 Huge 200 – 1200 (2d6 x 100)
12 Expansive 1000 – 6000 (1d6 x 1000)

(^1) The unit could send far less, depending on the assessed risk of the
ticket, or by employer request

#### Fame/Infamy of the Unit

Mercenaries live by the amount of work they can get, and their
ability to draw employers to their negotiating tables instead those
of their competition. While good scouts and administrators help
draw in business, nothing is as important to a mercenary unit as
its overall reputation. Word of mouth advertising, media coverage
and other avenues of spreading their reputation is all but priceless.
Whether it is a reporter claiming the unit uses too much firepower
or a former employer bragging about how he got one over on their
administration, someone will find such information appealing – and
interesting enough to look further.

Referees can roll or choose on the table below to determine how
far the reputation of the mercenary unit has travelled, detailing any
earned bonuses to their Social Standing throws when applicable.
This table is based not only upon the die roll, but also the size of the
unit (determined above).

(^1) This DM is only applicable when the Referee believes the unit’s fame/infamy can come into play

#### Unit Traits

With so many individuals being recruited into a single unit, there is
a touch of social homogeneity that occurs. Likes and dislikes tend
to be shared throughout the ranks, giving an overall appearance of
a constant. Individual members may or may not share this quirk or
belief structure, but enough of the unit does that it can be considered
a general trait amongst its common members.

Referees should choose below or roll a d66 – 2d6 with one die
representing the ‘tens’ digit, the other as ‘ones’ – on the table to
determine an interesting quality of the mercenary unit. Player
Character members do not have to abide by this, but camaraderie
might influence it upon them during game play.

#### Unit Experience

Just how effective a unit can be in its missions is not simply left to
the number of warm bodies it can throw at the enemy. The overall
level of training and experience of the unit members matter greatly to
the success of their missions and to the degree in which the average
members get paid for their tickets. Knowing the overall Rank and
experience of their unit is especially important to Player Character
mercenaries, as it directly affects their finances and survivability.

The Referee must roll on or choose from the following table as to
the general skill level of the unit. That skill level is then compared
to the table below, which gives the Rank breakdown of the unit. For
obvious reasons, any Player Character members are not included in
the listed results – they are considered to be additional ‘bonuses’
to the unit.

#### An Example Mercenary Unit

Having picked up Traveller: Mercenary, the Referee decides to build a
mercenary unit that might end up recruiting his Aslan Player Characters
during the next game session. He begins by figuring out that the unit

_- the Hyr’kur (Talonbourne) – is actually rather small [_ roll of 6 on Unit
Size _], having only 21 current members [_ 2d6 x 3 _]. They are relatively well
known in Aslan space [_ roll of 11 on Unit Fame _], even if they are not
considered to be veterans in the business [_ roll of 6 on Unit Average
Skill; Marginal _]._

There is only one [ 7% of 21 = 1.47, rounded to1 ] member at Rank 4,
two [ 10% of 21 = 2.1, rounded to 2 ] at Rank 3, six [ 30% of 21 = 6.3,
rounded to 6 ] Rank 2s, four [20% of 21 = 4.2, rounded to 4] Rank 1s,
and eight [ 30% of 21 = 6.3, rounded to 6 plus the remaining two
members ] Rank 0 members. There is something strange and interesting
about an all-Aslan mercenary unit, especially one that has shown itself
to be even more belligerent than the common outlook of their species
[ rolled the 35 result on Unit Traits; Violent ]! The Referee is satisfied
with the unit, and he hopes his players will give them a try.

### RREECRUITINGCRUITING

#### Sample Mercenaries and Pre-Made Characters

While mercenary Non-Player Characters can be generated using the normal character generation rules, it is easier just to note down
Characteristics and the few appropriate skills needed to interact with the unit. A skilled mercenary has three or four levels in the skills related
to his individual career path, and zero or one level in a half-dozen other skills.

The following are pre-made mercenary Non-Player Characters that Referees can use in their gaming sessions as adversaries or to populate
the units around their Player Characters.

### NNEEWW CCOOMBATMBAT RRUULESLES

This chapter gives Referees a series of new optional combat rules
to use with their _Traveller_ fights. They add a few extra touches when
the bullets, beams and blades start flying. Also in this chapter is a
more extensive, unit-based combat system designed for large scale
battles. Combining elements of personal combat with the feel of a
chaotic wartime engagement, this ‘Battle System’ is very useful for
mercenary units that move and act in large forces.

## ADVANCED RANGED COMBAT

The core rulebook for _Traveller_ explains how to pick up a firearm,
throwing knife, grenade or the like and use it to attack an enemy.
It also discusses the firing modes of some types of weaponry.
Although these rules are perfectly good enough for a common fire
fight, we have looked a little deeper into additional ways to augment
and further utilise ranged combat.

The following are several advanced rules that can be used with
_Traveller_ ranged combat attacks, if the Referee allows for their use.

#### Aiming for the Kill

Aiming at a target for several seconds can increase a shooter’s
chance of striking the target, but it can also be used to try and strike
specifically vital areas on a target. Typically used by snipers and
precision marksmen, the ability to go for a head shot can be the
difference between a clean kill and a botched job.

Specifically aiming for a kill works exactly like regular Aiming (see
_Traveller_ core rulebook page 61), but does not add to the character’s
DM to hit the target. Instead, the character gains a bonus to his
damage equal to the amount of initiative spent specifically Aiming
for the Kill. He cannot dodge, duck, or move while aiming. He
also loses his Aim bonus if hit or distracted. The maximum bonus
obtainable from Aiming for the Kill is +6.

#### Extreme Range Firing

Certain ranged weapons may fire at ranges beyond the Distant
range band. This remarkably long distance is not only difficult to be
accurate at, but can make the shot less effective. Any weapon that
has the ability to fire into the Distant range band can potentially
strike targets even beyond, so long as the firer can see the target.
Weapons fired at this extreme range do so using the modifiers for
Distant range with an additional DM of –2. Only characters with at
least three levels of skill in the weapon may fire at extreme range. To
fire at extreme range, characters must be stationary and prepared
to fire from some kind of rest (tripod, tree limb, bunker embrasure
and so on). Vehicles must be stationary for weapons to be fired at
extreme range from it. Energy-based weapons (lasers, PGMPs, and
so on) inflict half damage (round up) at this extreme range.

This can be combined with Aiming fir the Kill (above).

#### Blind Firing

Often can be dangerous in a firefight due to the possibility of hitting
allies, important items or bystanders, blind firing is whenever a firer
holds his weapon in a way to fire overhead, around a corner, into
a doorway and so on without looking where he is shooting. This is
extremely unlikely to actually hit anyone specific, but it might be
just the thing to keep an enemy’s head down long enough for the
situation to improve.

Blind firing works exactly like any other form of firing (including
automatic), but it always treats the firer as having Level 0 in that
weapon’s relative skill. Additionally an extra die is thrown when
firing, but before any calculations are made the highest die (or one
of the highest, in case of a tie) is removed completely. For automatic
firing this extra die is thrown after all the dice are paired up, with one
extra die rolled for each pair of dice. Any successful attack(s) needs
to then have a die rolled to randomly choose which eligible target in
the firing line is hit – whether friend or foe.

# NNEEWW CCOOMBATMBAT RRUULESLES

### NNNEEWEWW C CCOOMBATOMMBBAATT R RRUULESULLEESS

#### Panic Fire

Only the steel nerves of a warrior can hope to stand up to incoming
bullets and lasers without losing their aim; not everyone can be so
lucky. Fear can make someone do unexpected things, including
emptying a magazine of ammunition wildly toward the enemy.
Called Panic Fire, this action is a horrible waste of bullets, but it can
turn a weapon’s payload into a spray of destruction.

In order to call upon Panic Fire, a character must be using some
form of small arms slug thrower. Panic fire uses all remaining
rounds in the weapon, and hits are resolved as if the weapon were
being fired with an Auto rating two higher than the weapon would
normally have. For every shot there is a -2DM penalty to hit. If there
are insufficient bullets left in the weapon’s magazine prior to firing
then there will be no benefit from using Panic Fire.

#### Parabolic Fire

There are several weapons that use munitions that arc high into the
air instead of directly toward the target. Grenade launchers, hand
grenades, mortar shells; these are all examples of weaponry that are
designed for a style of attack called Parabolic fire. By adding a arc on
the projectile while judging roughly where it will land, the firer can
estimate how far the shot needs to land in order to avoid obstacles.
Low walls, trenches, and bunkers can sometimes be circumvented
by a well-placed grenade.

To throw a grenade or launch another projectile in a proper
parabolic arc, the character makes the appropriate skill (Heavy
Weapons, Athletics and so on) check with a penalty depending on
how far the shot is intended to land (see table below), regular range
modifiers do not apply. If the check is successful, add the Effect
to the projectile’s damage. No matter what happens, the projectile
scatters in a random direction 1d6 minus the Effect in meters. This
means that even a failure could still potentially strike the target (or
scatter back over the obstacle for short parabolic arcs!), but get no
bonus to damage.

#### Shotgun Spread

The statistics listed for a shotgun on page 99 of the _Traveller_ core
rulebook are used when loading it with the standard shot-filled
shell. It is possible however, to load a shotgun with a lighter cluster
of metallic slivers instead. Flechette rounds hurl a cloud of small
pieces of metal toward a target. Although it does not have anywhere

near the penetration of a common round, the flechette shell spreads
out slightly to puncture and lacerate a wider area of the target or
targets.

Any shotgun loaded specifically with flechette rounds can be fired
like a common round at a single target up to Short range, using
the standard statistics for the weapon. If firing at a target or group
of targets at Medium or Long range, the frag shell has its damage
reduced to 2d6 but gains a +1DM bonus to hit, and can hit not only
the target aimed at but also anyone (friend or foe) within 1 meter of
the initial target.

#### Suppression Fire

Any seasoned veteran will explain that the best way to survive any
fire fight is for a combatant to keep their head down and out of the
line of fire. However, if a trooper is doing that they are not likely to
be hitting any enemies either. The key is to try and get the enemy to
keep their heads down more than the trooper. The best way to do
this is through Suppression fire. By shooting at an enemy without
even trying to necessarily hit them, the impacts of the attacks will
likely make them think twice before ducking out of cover.

Suppression fire works by having the character actually target the
areas surrounding the target; a wall, a tree or even the ground at their
feet are all perfectly suitable. The impact of the character’s attacks
are often enough to give pause to a potential attacker. The firing
character rolls his shooting attack like normal, except with a –2 DM
for trying to hit cover and nearby objects to the target(s). This attack
action also uses up double the normal amount of ammunition per
attack. Failures are treated as normal misses. Success means that
the firer has hit close enough to the target to force them to duck
away, stalling their next action by adding an initiative penalty equal
to the Effect of the attack. Suppressed targets also receive a –1DM
penalty to any skill checks that they try to perform in both the current
and following combat round.

Automatic fire can be used for Suppression fire, but no target can
be affected twice by Suppression fire on the same action. The target
must be allowed to take one action before he can be suppressed
again. If multiple hits are used upon the same target, the highest
Effect takes precedence.

There are some situations and instances that can make a target so
unshakable that they do not care about Suppression fire, and will

## GROUND FORCES VERSUS STARSHIPS

In _Traveller_ , combat is normally a handful of individuals against
another handful of individuals, with each side armed to take out
the other. Occasionally a larger weapon system or vehicle can get
caught in the mix, laying waste to lesser targets in short order. These
sorts of conflicts are already a part of the _Traveller_ game system with
the current rules in place, and such scenes should take place with
relative ease.

Starship-scale weaponry and armor is dramatically different than
the weapon and armor values used by ground forces (infantry and
planetary vehicles). A single strike from a starship-scale weapon will
likely vaporise even the biggest and thickest of vehicles – let alone
a single infantry target. As described in the _Traveller_ core rulebook,
starship-scale weaponry multiplies its damage by 50 when striking a
ground forces target. A single successful impact is normally enough
to eliminate a ground force target, but gunners can get frustrated
trying to ‘swat flies’. It is worth noting that starship weapons are
not designed for engaging ground targets and so their rate of fire is
painfully slow, able to fire weapons only once every three Combat
rounds, and some weapons are utterly useless (missiles, for
example, do not have the necessary targeting programming to be
effective against ground targets).

#### Ground Force Weaponry against Starship-

#### scale Targets

Because starship-scale weaponry is so lethal to ground force targets
it is not often that a vehicle or heavy infantry would ever want to
make a stand against a starship. Most ground force weaponry
simply cannot muster enough damage potential to do anything
but scratch the paint of a starship. Starships are shielded from the
void of space and layered in armor designed to withstand raw star
radiation and absolute zero temperatures – a bullet just seems to
pale in comparison.

Some heavier or advanced weaponry however, can be used to inflict
minor damage upon starship-scale targets. Where bullets and
flechettes cannot hope to penetrate the hull of a starship, high-yield
weapons like plasma and fusion cannons can punch through lighter
starship-scale targets.

Gaining a +4DM bonus to hit anything on the starship-scale, ground
force weaponry must divide its damage by 50 before comparing it
to a starship-scale target’s armor. Because a single weapon will,

obviously, be unable to punch though armor it is possible for
multiple weapons to all target the starship simultaneously, and
the cumulative effect can inflict damage. Every additional ground
weapon beyond the first can add half its damage dice to the total
before dividing the total by 50 in order to calculate damage.

Most small arms (rifles, pistols, and the like) will have no effect
against a starship, only lasers and energy weapons have a chance
to inflict real harm.

#### Example

The Starglider is currently in its warm up launch preparations on the
starport pad when a group of marines and starport security attack the
ship, with the starport authorities having realised that the crew are
actually a group of wanted criminals. The Starglider has rather basic
of hull armor with a rating of 6. The marines have an assortment of
weaponry firing at the huge stationary target. There are a dozen security
armed with gauss rifles, these are ignored. The marines are equipped
with a dozen FGMP-14s and there are some twenty more security armed
with laser rifles. Finally one marine is armed with a TL15 AT gun fitted
into his suit of battledress.

In the first round of firing 9 FGMPs, 15 of the lasers and the AT gun
all hit. The first FGMP does 16D6 damage, the others combine for
64d6 (8*16d6/2), the AT gun does 5d6 (10d6/2) and the lasers 37d6
(15*5d6/2, rounded down). This totals 122d6 damage, divided by 50
and then rounded down – the combined effect of all this firepower is
2d6 damage to the ship. A 10 is rolled and the Starglider’s armor of
6 is deducted from this. Looking at the damage table on page 150 of
the main Traveller rulebook a single hit has been inflicted upon the
Starglider, which ends up reducing the ship’s hull by 1. Certainly a good
attempt by the marines, but not enough to prevent the Starglider taking
off and her villainous crew escaping.

## BATTLE SYSTEM – LARGE SCALE

## CONFLICT IN TRAVELLER

These rules offer a fairly simple, abstract system for dealing with
large battles (those involving more than a platoon of men to either
side) in Traveller. The Battle System rules take a look at the bigger
picture in a conflict, not the individuals. While this does not mean
that the Player Characters will be ignored during the action, it does
mean that most of their individual skills and talents will not come
into play, there is only so much a small team of adventurers can do
on a battlefield where thousands of troops clash.

#### Preparation for Battle

Before a Battle-scale conflict can occur, the Referee must set all of
the ‘pieces’ in order to play. Each acting group is divided under a
specific skill group and unit leader, creating the individual units that
will be taking part of the battle.

There are eight types of units in the Battle System engagement
rules. They are as follows.

### NNNEEWEWW C CCOOMBATOMMBBAATT R RRUULESULLEESS

- Infantry – Infantry – Any basic combat unit made up of men on foot or
    single-driver vehicles (bikes, sleds and so one) equipped with
    rifles, energy weapons and other automatic firepower.
- Heavy Infantry – Heavy Infantry – Any combat unit wearing Battle Dress and
    equipped with Heavy Weapons.
- Close Quarters – Close Quarters – Any combat unit equipped solely with
    pistols, melee or natural weaponry.
- Vehicle – Vehicle – Any unit consisting of a small number of individual
    multi-crew vehicles (AFVs, hovertraks, etc.) or single larger
    vehicles (tanks, grav carrier, etc.).
- Artillery – Artillery – Any unit of long-range weaponry used to attack the
    enemy from the farthest limits of the battlefield; also a unit of
    Artillery Battle Dress soldiers.
- Ortillery – Ortillery – Space based artillery, normally only available to one
    side in a battle. Less accurate than regular artillery, but deadly
    and immune to enemy fire from the ground.
- Close Air Support (CAS) – Close Air Support (CAS) – Aircraft of any sort that support
    land troops. These can include aeroplanes, helicopters and
    grav vehicles designed for this role.
- Command – Command – The primary leadership center of the entire
    force.

#### Creating A Military Force

The Referee will determine how many units there will be available to
both sides (as well as their types and unit strength), unless playing
in a campaign where the Player Characters will have jurisdiction
over the disposition of troops.

The number of members in the unit can vary drastically depending
on the number of potential members the commander has access to.
If he only has eight hundred soldiers, he is not going to be able to
make an Infantry Brigade of 1000 men.

#### Unit Statistics

Once the make up of an army is decided there are a number of
statistics for each unit that need to be noted. They are as follows:

- Unit Type (Infantry, Artillery and so on)Unit Type (Infantry, Artillery and so on)
- Unit Strength (numbers of men)Unit Strength (numbers of men)
- Unit RatingUnit Rating
- MoraleMorale
- Tech LevelTech Level

#### UNIT TYPE

This is simply determined by what manner of members make up the
unit; Infantry, vehicles and so on.

#### MEMBER STRENGTH

This is the effective number of members in the unit. This is also
the number of ‘hits’ the unit can withstand before being destroyed.
This number will steadily decrease during a conflict as the unit takes
casualties.

#### UNIT RATING

Highly skilled troops are capable of overcoming less well trained
enemy forces even if severely outnumbered. Unit skill not only

has a direct influence upon the unit’s morale.

The unit rating reflects also the average skill levels of the troops.
Raw troops will have a few individuals with skill 0, but many without
any skill whatsoever. Trained will all be of skill 0, whilst elites will
have a skill of 3, on average (and on very rare occasions, even more
than this). Different units are specialized in different skills, as shown
below. The defining skill of the units is calculated using the base
average of the unit members.

- Infantry – Infantry – Gun Combat (any non-pistol)
- Heavy Infantry – Heavy Infantry – Heavy Weapons
- Close Quarters – Close Quarters – Melee (any) or Gun Combat (any pistol)
- Vehicle – Vehicle – Drive, Flyer or Seafarer (depending on the type of
    vehicles)
- Artillery – Artillery – Heavy Weapons (field artillery)
- Ortillery – Ortillery – Gunner (any)
- Close Air Support – Close Air Support – Flyer (any)
- Command – Command – Tactics _and_ Leadership

#### UNIT MORALE

Unlike personal Morale (see earlier in this chapter), this statistic
is based partially on the skill of the unit and their faith in the
commands of the force commander. The Unit Morale of each unit
is calculated by adding the Unit Rating number to the Unit Size plus
the Leadership skill of the primary Command unit of the army.

_Example: A veteran battalion of Infantry will have a Unit Morale of 5
plus their Unit Rating of 4, plus the Leadership of their Command unit.
However, a veteran fire team will only have a Unit Morale of 1 plus 4 in
addition to the Leadership of their Command unit – showing how large
units add to the willpower of the soldiers within them._

If, during battle, a unit’s morale reaches 0 it is broken and will attempt
to flee the field or surrender, depending on the circumstances on
the battlefield.

#### TECH LEVEL

A few troopers in battledress are unlikely to have much trouble with
many hundreds of wild-eyed swordsmen and tech-level is a very
important consideration once battle is joined. All units equipped to
Tech Level 3 or less are considered to be Close Quarters units.

#### Deployment Zone

Each force has three deployment zones in which to place its forces.
These are named Front Line, Reserves and Support, any unit may
be placed in any of these zones, apart from Close Air Support and
Ortillery, which are always assumed to start in the Support zone.

Although some units are better positioned in different zones.
Artillery will almost always be placed in Support, whilst infantry,
heavy infantry and vehicles will almost never be placed there. Each
unit benefits from its placement and it is important for either side
to place its troops appropriately in order to maximise their combat
efficiency.

#### Placing the Units on the Battlefield

Once all of an army’s units have been formed, rated and recorded
in order to keep track of their statistics, the force commander (or
the commanding player) will decide where exactly on the battlefield
the units will begin. They, of course, will be allowed to move once a
battle has begun.

Ortillery units are not considered to be on the battlefield, as such,
bringing their devastating firepower down upon their enemies from
the safety of orbit. They are, for convenience, positioned in the
Support Zone of their army.

Close Air Support units are held in reserve, they do not enter the
battlefield until their commander decides they are required and
when they do appear it will be in their own Support zone.

#### Execution of Battle

The units have been set, and the battle has begun. Now it is time
for the bullets and bodies to start flying. This happens in a series of
phases through the Battle Round, with the Command unit taking
charge and sending other units into action.

The Execution of Battle phase comprised of the following phases.

- Command Phase – Command Phase – Deciding which and how many units will
    act this round

### NNEWEW C COMBATOMBAT R RULESULES

- Action Phase – Action Phase – Giving units their actions and recording the
    results
- Morale Phase – Morale Phase – Recording the Morale losses or gains of
    each unit, recording broken units
- Withdrawal Phase (optional) – Withdrawal Phase (optional) – Force commanders may
    decide to flee from combat

What each individual phase means to the combat, and how they
function in Battle System, is detailed in the subsections below.

#### Command Phase

The Command Phase is arguably the most important phase in the
round, as it determines how many units of the army will be allowed
to take actions this round. A combination of the pre-battle plans set
down and the communication capabilities of the Command Unit,
this phase begins every Battle Round.

Both sides’ primary Command Units must roll a Leadership throw
8+ to determine the number of Unit Actions the army will receive
this round. If successful, the army is allowed the Command Unit’s
Tactics level plus the Effect of the throw in Unit Actions. If a failure,
the army simply receives the Command Unit’s Tactics level in
actions instead. This is a very important throw for the army, and the
primary Command Unit should be protected because of it.

A Command Unit will receive a +1DM to the Leadership roll if they
are situated within their Reserves zone, being closer to the action
they will be able to judge the situation on the ground that much
more clearly. However being closer to the front lines also means
that they are more likely to become subject to enemy attacks.

The Command Unit can choose to use these Unit Actions as it sees
fit during the Action Phase. Unused Unit Actions are not carried
over from round to round, and must be used or wasted.

If an army is without a Command Unit at all during the Command
Phase, every unit in the army immediately loses one point of Unit
Morale and must each pass a Unit Morale test in order to take a
Unit Action with a -1 DM. Losing the command element of an army
is often the breaking point of the conflict, and few armies last long
after that happens.

For example, Archibald Venturi is leading his army from his primary
Command Unit. His Command Unit has a Tactics of 3 and a Leadership
of 2. During the Command Phase, he rolls his Leadership and scores a 4
and 4 plus his skill of 2 = 10; success. His Effect is 2 plus his Tactics of 3
gives his army a total of 5 Unit Actions this Battle Round.

#### Secondary Command Units

Armies will normally create a second Command Unit to lead the
army in case the first is destroyed or broken. This is a good idea
for those who can afford the additional command staff, as it
allows for a single additional Unit Action each round while the
primary Command Unit is still in control.

Should the primary Command Unit be destroyed or broken, the
secondary Command Unit takes control and becomes primary.
However, the unexpected re-structuring process is harmful to
the chain of command, and the Tactics and Leadership skills of
the unit are reduced by 1 (minimum of 0).

### NNEEWW CCOOMBATMBAT RRUULESLES

The Command Unit can also try call up any CAS units he wishes
to use during his Command Phase, needing to roll Tactics 8+. The
Effect of the roll should be noted, this is how many Battle Rounds the
CAS can stay before they have to leave the battlefield to replemish
fuel and munitions. A failed roll means the unit is delayed and the
Command unit can try again the following Battle Round.

#### Action Phase

The primary part of the Battle Round, the Action Phase is
unsurprisingly where the units take their actions across the
battlefield. It is during this phase that units will move and attack.

The Action Phase begins with each commander choosing to spend
Unit Actions on their army’s individual units. Each unit may accept
up to 2 Unit Actions in this manner, each one chosen as an Attack or
Maneuver action. A unit may only use one Maneuver action each
round, but is not limited on its Attack capability. Thus, an unit could
Attack twice with two Unit Actions, Maneuver and Attack with two
Unit Actions, or Maneuver or Attack with one Unit Action.

Continuing the example, Archibald gives his own unit two Unit Actions,
his twin Close Quarters Platoons one Unit Actions each (he hopes to
get them close enough to carve up his hated enemies), and his Artillery
Squad the last one.

### NNNEEWEWW C CCOOMBATOMMBBAATT R RRUULESULLEESS

The force commander with the most Unit Actions rolled (or the
highest Tactics level in the case of a tie) chooses one of his units
with Unit Actions this round and activates them. Once they have
finished their first (or only) Unit Action, the enemy commander may
then do the same. This order continues until all Unit Actions have
been taken.

Once the Unit Actions have been spent or assigned, the force
commanders can take turns performing them. It is important to
note that all units that have been given two Unit Actions cannot
perform their second Unit Action until after all other units with Unit
Actions have performed their first.

#### Maneuver Actions

When a unit is given a Maneuver as its Unit Action, it can move
into an adjacent deployment zone. Ortillery is unable to move,
Close Air Support can move through up to three zones in a single
maneuver action. This is to symbolise the unit making headway
or taking a withdrawal on the battlefield. It is possible that a unit
will not be able to enter a deployment zone as it may be locked by
enemy forces.

Each unit can effectively block one enemy unit from entering the
deployment zone it occupies, as long as it has morale greater than 0.
Infantry and Heavy Infantry units can block two units from entering
their zone, Ortillery and Close Air Support are unable to block enemy
units, and no unit can block an enemy Close Air Support unit.

When a non-broken (see Unit Morale above, and the Morale Phase
below) unit uses a Maneuver action to move away from the enemy
(making the number higher), they are considered to be tactically
withdrawing, and regain 1 point of Unit Morale.

A unit that moves out of its support deployment zone away from the
enemy is considered to have retreated from the battlefield and takes
no further part in the battle.

#### Attack Actions

A unit taking an attack action represents several minutes of that
unit’s battlefield experience. The unit is not simply making attacks
when it uses such an action, but also seeking cover, making
equipment repairs, and even trying to take care of their own
wounded. All of a unit’s battlefield behaviours that are not revolving
around manoeuvring are summarised in the Attack action.

When a unit decides to make its Attack action, it must first pass an
immediate Unit Morale test by rolling equal to or under the unit’s
current Unit Morale in order to take action on 1d6. It is possible for
a unit with high morale to automatically pass this test.

Once the unit has verified its ability to perform an Attack action, the
unit chooses a valid target unit for its attack. Each type of unit gets
a different DM for attacking enemy units different distances away,

showing its ability to inflict damage upon targets that close or far
away. This DM is then used to modify the Attack Skill throw made to
attack that target, added to which is the skill of the attacking unit. The
distance modifiers and the unit’s difficulty to inflict damage upon
the enemy are found on the preceding tables. A listing of ‘–‘ means
the unit is unable to attack effectively at anything at that range.

Once the unit has declared a valid target for its Attack action, the
unit then makes its Unit Skill throw at the difficulty listed on the
preceding table. If it fails, the unit’s attack was ineffectual and no
actual damage is inflicted (but the target’s Unit Morale still suffers).
If successful, there is the potential of inflicting casualties upon the
enemy unit.

The Effect from a successful Attack action helps determine how
much damage is inflicted upon the target unit. The Effect is added
(or subtracted) to the modifier listed on the preceding table. These
modifiers show how easy or difficult it is for a specific type of unit
to harm another type of unit. Particularly hard-to-damage units like
vehicles or artillery tend to have much smaller units, so inflicting
even a single casualty upon them is a success for an attack.

#### ADDITIONAL MODIFIERS

- For each point of unit size +1 to the casualties inflicted.
- Technology level has a huge effect on casualty results. Deduct
    the difference between the tech levels from the casualties
    inflicted upon a unit with a higher technology level, and add the
    difference to any casualties inflicted upon a unit with a lower
    technology level.

A unit that maneuvers into an enemy zone and attacks that turn
doubles the amount of casualties it inflicts for that attack upon any
enemy unit within the same deployment zone, representing the
bonus that the attacking force gets from flanking fire. CAS units do
not benefit from this bonus, nor can they be subjected to it.

A maximum of two units are able to attack a single enemy unit in
a single Battle Round. However they can attack that unit up to two
times each if they have enough actions allocated to them.

Ortillery and Artillery units require forward observers to plot out
enemy positions and call down fire upon the enemy. This takes one
action, leaving these units only able to fire once per Battle Round,
and then only if they have been assigned two actions during the
Command phase.

Example: An elite battalion-sized Tech Level 10 Vehicle unit attacks a
Tech level 6 Infantry unit. The Vehicle unit is in its own Reserves zone,
thilst the target is in the enemy’s front line, creating a range of 2.

Needing an 8+ to inflict damage the unit rolls a 5 and a 4 and adds to
this its skill of 3 (for an elite unit) and the +2DM for the range, the result
of 14 is more than sufficient to inflict casualties!

### NNEEWW CCOOMBATMBAT RRUULESLES

_The number of casualties inflicted are the Effect of the Attack Skill throw
(6), plus the difference in Tech Levels (4), plus the size of the attacking
unit (5) plus the number in the Unit Damage table (5). A total of 20
(6+4+5+5) casualties fall under the withering hail of fire._

#### Rally Action

Additionally, the Command Unit of an army may perform a special
type of action that boosts Unit Morale called a Rally action. This
costs a Unit Action, and functions otherwise like a Maneuver
action. The Command Unit chooses a single unit in his force that has
lost Unit Morale to send a communiqué to and makes a Leadership
throw 9+. Failure means that the unit is even more confused by the
communication, losing another point of Unit Morale. If successful,
the targeted unit regains lost Unit Morale equal to the Effect of the
throw.

Once all units in the army that received any Unit Actions have taken
their first one, no matter the status of the enemy army’s progression,
units that received a second Unit Action may begin to take them.
The phase continues back and forth until one side has no more Unit
Actions to take, at which point the other side takes all remaining
actions in rapid succession. When all Unit Actions have been used
and resolved, the Action Phase ends.

#### Morale Phase

After the bullets, lasers and orbital fire of the Action Phase, the
Morale Phase is the upkeep from the last few minutes of battle. This
phase is where units realise they are in over their head, perhaps
even so much so that they retreat from the battle altogether.

At the beginning of the Morale Phase the army units must check to
see if they qualify for an Unit Morale loss or gain. The following are
the ways a Battle Unit loses or gains Unit Morale.

- All units that were attacked in some way (successfully or not)
    immediately lose one point of Unit Morale.
- Any unit that shared a deployment zone with a friendly unit that
    was utterly destroyed this turn loses one point of Unit Morale.
- Any unit that shared a deployment zone with a friendly unit that
    routed this turn loses one point of Unit Morale.
- Any unit reduced to less than half of its starting Member
    Strength loses one point of Unit Morale.
- All units in an army that has a Command Unit destroyed or
    broken this turn loses 2 points of Unit Morale.
- Any unit whose attack destroys an enemy unit gains 2 points of
    Unit Morale.
- Any unit whose attack destroys an enemy Command Unit gains
    3 points of Unit Morale.
- Any unit whose attacks an enemy unit that then routs this turn
    1 points of Unit Morale.

Once all of the units have had their Unit Morale adjusted for
whatever reason, any units that have fallen to 0 Unit Morale are
now considered to be broken. Broken units are no longer capable of
engaging the enemy and are removed from the army’s roster.

Once all units have taken stock of their new Unit Morale values and
whether or not they have broken, the Morale Phase ends.

#### Withdrawal Phase (optional)

A commander can decide to withdraw his forces from battle, either
piecemeal or all at once (conceding defeat in the latter case). If
neither force commander wishes to use the Withdrawal Phase, the
round ends and a new Battle Round begins with a new Command
Phase.

If both force commanders decide to use the Withdrawal Phase, all
units leave the battle without suffering any further casualties or
damage. The battle ends immediately.

If one force commander chooses to use the Withdrawal Phase and
the other does not, the withdrawing army will be subjected to one
last volley of attacks as they flee the battle. Every non-withdrawing
unit can make a single Attack action at one enemy unit.

The Referee can choose to create further scenes of chasing down
the fleeing units as they scatter away from the battlefield, seeking
refuge from the enemy. In many cases however, even the victorious
units will want to take count of their own wounded and casualties,
leaving the routed forces to their own.

Ortillery and CAS units are unable to act on the field of battle on
their own, if all ground forces of their army are withdrawing or have
been routed or destroyed they will automatically be assumed to have
withdrawn from the battle, leaving their enemies victorious.

### HHEEADQUARTERSADQUARTERS AANDND MMIILITARYLITARY BBAASESSES

No matter where in the galaxy military or mercenary unit performs
its duties, they must have someplace they call home to return to
when the day is don. For some it could be a few small barracks
buildings behind a chain link fence, for others – a massive floating
compound in the void of space. The larger the unit, the greater the
need for a base of operations.

This chapter describes the placement of headquarters facilities
throughout the galaxy for mercenary units and military forces.
It presents dozens of options and potential ideas for players to
build their own bases or Referees to prepare the headquarters of
the people the characters will be interacting with. Hearing that a
mercenary unit is big is one thing, but having a unit member give
the Player Characters a guided tour of their seventy-square kilometer
walled complex can make a huge difference in how they perceive
that mercenary unit.

## THE IMPORTANCE OF A CENTRAL

## BASE OR HQ

Unless a unit’s various members spend every minute of every
day together, they will need to arrange for a central location (or
locations) to serve as their ‘home base’. This should serve as the
intelligence center, meeting hall, home away from home, and
equipment storage facility – amongst other purposes. It is where
the unit’s officers connect with their fellow members, and military
operations are planned.

Although all of these things could be undertaken nomadically or
perhaps from several distinct locations, it is far more efficient to
have one main hub where a unit member knows they can go to
when they need unit resources. Whether those ‘resources’ are as
simple as a couch to sleep on between tickets or as complex as
seeing a therapist for a bad case of post-traumatic stress, the base
or headquarters of the unit should be available.

Governmental or private military forces keep bases for their armed
forces. They need a place to stay during their tours and somewhere
to keep their equipment. When a civilian joins the military they
eat, sleep and breathe the army (or marine) life. A military base,
even if it is just a few barracks buildings and a motor pool, is an
important component in any military force. Even the simplest of
frontier forts can mean the difference between life or death for the
soldiers stationed there.

A mercenary unit has a slightly different outlook upon their
headquarters. A good base is expensive to maintain, but adds to a
unit’s credibility and efficiency. If a unit commander has to send out

messages to all the corners of a planet to call together the team of
professionals an employer needs, time is lost and money must be
spent on transporting the members around. Always having to contact
a supplier to get equipment the unit could have been storing at its
headquarters is just as expensive and risky. Even if it means paying
a few extra thousand credits every couple of months, a professional
mercenary unit will try to keep a central headquarters.

Setting aside the social and general benefits of having a central base
of operations from which a unit can operate, there are certain logistic
bonuses involved. Having a suitable central hub or headquarters
from which a unit can operate (or at least a satellite office large
enough), the unit can function with additional ease and fluidity.

The following bonuses apply to a unit that has an operational base
or headquarters.

- Any Admin or Advocate skill throws made on behalf of the unit
    have a +1DM
- Mercenary administrators gain one additional Ticket Adjustment
    if negotiations take place inside their HQ
- Any Engineer, Mechanic, Medic or Weapon Engineering skill
    throws made within the base/HQ can have a +1DM if they have
    sufficient facilities
- Rolls made to acquire equipment using the Availability rules
    (see _New Equipment_ for details) gain +1DM if the base/HQ is
    the delivery point

#### What Makes a Base or Headquarters Suit-

#### able?

There are several places in this chapter that will talk about ‘suitable’
facilities, bases and headquarters. This is a rather abstract
terminology, but it is a malleable concept from unit to unit. If a unit
does not have enough room for personnel, storage for equipment,
medical bays for medics to work or similar problems with the facility
it will be more of a detriment than a benefit.

In order for a Referee to determine whether a base/headquarters
is considered suitable for the unit’s purposes, the following ten
questions should be asked about the facilities. So long as at least
seven of the questions are answered ‘yes’, the facility is suitable.

1 1. Is there enough room for every unit member staying in the. Is there enough room for every unit member staying in the
ffacility to have a sleeping area, personal storage, and access acility to have a sleeping area, personal storage, and access
tto waste removal?o waste removal?

It is important that the members of the unit that have to stay in
the facility have their own place to sleep and store their equipment
when not in use. In smaller facilities that have too many personnel

# MMEERCENARYRCENARY HHEEADQUARTERSADQUARTERS AANDND

# MMIILITARYLITARY BBAASESSES

### HHEEADQUARTERSADQUARTERS AANDND MMIILITARYLITARY BBAASESSES

for each to have their own sleeping space it is sometimes necessary
to have schedules to make sure that all personnel get enough
sleep. Waste removal services for personal litter and organic refuse
is a must, even for species that might not be otherwise bothered
by such things, especially when they receive business visits from
potential employers.

2 2. Are there offices for officers, administrators or legal. Are there offices for officers, administrators or legal
aadvocates?dvocates?

In order to keep good records and proper files for the unit, a
base facility should have rooms or at least some dedicated desks
for paperwork and other official documents. It is good business
practice to make sure that unit member records are in good order
and accessible, especially if audited by a governmental agency.

3 3. Is there enough motor pool/engineering bay space for the. Is there enough motor pool/engineering bay space for the
uunit’s vehicles?nit’s vehicles?

If a base facility does not have room for a unit’s mechanical support,
like vehicles and landing craft, things will become too cramped with
fuel and spare parts to make use of them easily. Not to mention the
poor living conditions having such materials lying around will make
for the unit members. Any unit that utilises vehicles should make
sure that there is ample room to house them and all of the tools
necessary to keep them running.

NOTE: A unit with no vehicles can automatically answer this
question ‘yes’, as it needs no space at this time.

4 4. Is there special storage for hazardous or dangerous. Is there special storage for hazardous or dangerous
eequipment, such as heavy weapons, explosives, and fusion quipment, such as heavy weapons, explosives, and fusion
ccells?ells?

Military and mercenary units in the galaxy frequently utilise some
very dangerous technologies that require specific safety storage or
handling. A single mishandled PGMP can wipe out an entire squad
of men if fired accidentally in the base, and a misplaced cigarette
could detonate an entire crate of explosives if not secured properly.
Radioactive materials must be shielded from the rest of the base.
There are many important safety regulations that should be met
when dealing with dangerous equipment. If a base cannot follow
these regulations, they should not try to use the equipment when
at all possible.

NOTE: A unit that does not own examples of dangerous equipment
can automatically answer this question ‘yes’.

5 5. Is there at least one official Med Bay for every ten medics. Is there at least one official Med Bay for every ten medics
iin the unit?n the unit?

A proper base facility that houses medical professional members
within the unit must be ready to utilise their skills properly. Unit
medics and doctors cannot hope to perform surgery without
a decent medical bay, and even first aid can be made difficult in
the wrong environment. A good ratio to keep is one medical bay
for every full ten medically-trained members using the base. Unit
members are often injured in their line of work, and having a good
team of medics on hand can make a huge difference to morale.

NOTE: A unit with no medics can automatically answer this question
‘yes’, as it needs no medical bays at this time.

6 6. Are there emergency assets in place in case of base defence,. Are there emergency assets in place in case of base defence,
ffire or natural disaster?ire or natural disaster?

Although a military or mercenary base is likely to be considered a
rather safe place due to its personnel’s training, the unexpected can
always happen. An earthquake could drop in a ceiling, a fire could
trap men in the motor pool, or an enemy could launch an air strike
upon the site. When the facility itself becomes a target of destruction
(natural or not), all of the personnel inside should have emergency
assets to utilise. These come in the form of fire retardant blankets,
readily-marked breather masks, extinguishing systems, or even just
emergency generators or escape tunnels. Whatever the situation, a
good unit base will have specific ways to deal with it – or else it will
never survive its first emergency.

### HHHEEADQUARTERSEAADDQQUUAARRTTEERRSS AANDANNDD M MMIILITARYILLIITTAARRYY B BBAASESASSEESS

## THE FACILITIES OF A COMMON BASE

## OR HEADQUARTERS

Individual base facilities differ from unit to unit, especially if the unit
is a specialized one. A unit of professional sharpshooters will want
a fantastic weapon workshop and target range, but a close combat
platoon might prefer a complete gymnasium instead. Other than
the very basics, a headquarters facility can vary greatly.

The following subsections discuss the individual facilities that could
be found in a military base or mercenary headquarters.

#### Housing

Most bases will have barracks-style rooms in which the unit members
can sleep when they are off duty, often attached to small equipment
lockers where they can keep individual belongings. Side arms,
personal clothing and effects can be stowed near where a member
sleeps when stationed at the base, but privacy is rarely something
that a common unit member can hope for. Such privileges are
reserved for higher ranking or specialist members.

#### Dining

For any base that will be home to unit members for extended periods
of time, there has to be some form of dining area and food storage
system. Whether it is a small pantry and kitchenette, or a massive
cafeteria and mess hall, the base must have somewhere to arrange
for the feeding of the unit members.

#### Waste and Hygiene Services

All living species give off waste of some kind, even if it is not
offensive or obtrusive. Additionally, a unit member’s activities will
sometimes cause them to become physically soiled or filthy. A base
or headquarters must have adequate ways to clean its members of
such filth and dispose of their waste matter. Showers, locker rooms,
restroom areas; these are all suitable for most races.

#### Communications

An area or areas must be set aside to be used solely for
communications amongst the unit’s members and the outside
world. Mercenary administrators will want to arrange for ticket
negotiations, military officers will need to speak with their superiors,
and common members will need to make the occasional call home.
Unless a unit base is meant to stay a complete secret, it will have
some kind of outside communication capabilities if at all possible.

#### Equipment Storage

Weapons lockers, refrigerated grenade cases, armor closets;
these are just some of the necessary storage facilities a combat
unit will need in its base. Specialty storage for certain items can be
expensive, but always welcome when the unit learns of the danger
of having something like a ‘hot’ fusion cell or unknown bio-sample
around. Cheap cases can normally be acquired for average storage,
but a unit that takes good care of its equipment and makes sure

7 7. Is there a readily accessible means to communicate with. Is there a readily accessible means to communicate with
tthe members of the unit?he members of the unit?

For a base to truly be effective as the central hub for the unit, it must
be able to reach the members of the unit in the case of necessary
information or impending gatherings. Early technology might use
brightly coloured pennants that can be seen for many kilometers,
radio transmitters and the like. As technology increased bases
could utilise teleconferencing and other high-tech communication
methods. The unit hierarchy at the base must be able to communicate
with the unit as a whole; otherwise the base is just another halfway
house.

8 8. Are there private places where unit Psionists can go to. Are there private places where unit Psionists can go to
cconcentrate and remain stable?oncentrate and remain stable?

The scientific discovery of telepathy and psionic abilities brought
around a completely new way of looking at so-called psychics. Any
unit that utilises a Psionist’s abilities within the unit will want to
make sure that they have their own ‘quiet place’ to calm their minds
and shut out all of the mental static that can be counter-productive
to their talents. A Psionist member that has to use his abilities in
poor mental conditions can hope to do his best, but accidents –
accidents that could cost unit lives – can happen.

NOTE: A unit with no members Psionic members can automatically
answer this question ‘yes’, as it needs no private concentration
areas at this time.

9 9. Is there sufficient life support for the species in the unit?. Is there sufficient life support for the species in the unit?

In _Traveller_ , there is a multitude of different species that could
potentially become members of a mercenary unit or military
force, and not all of them can be expected to breathe oxygenated
atmosphere and tolerate a water-based hydrosphere. For obvious
reasons a base facility must have access to the atmospheric and
environmental conditions required by the races that call it home.
For planetary bases this is rarely a problem, but mobile starship
facilities or space stations will need to keep track of what kinds of air
and ambient chemicals are necessary or toxic for their members.

1 10. Is the facility’s location known and accessible to the unit 0. Is the facility’s location known and accessible to the unit
mmembers?embers?

For a base facility to be considered a headquarters, the unit
members must be able to travel to its location. A base is only useful
to its members if they utilise it, and it does them no good if they
cannot manage to find or get to it. New recruits might need to be
transported to the base the first time; once they have been shown
how to reach it, they had best be able to get back when called for
duty.

### HEADQUARTERS AND MILITARY BASES

everything is where it needs to be when they go to action is the most
efficient.

#### Addressing Area

A central room, hall, auditorium or maybe teleconference room is
often built for when the unit’s higher ups need to speak or address
the entire unit on hand at the base. The area could be used for a
dozen different things when the superiors are not using it, but it is
a definite necessity in any structured unit where the members must
receive orders.

#### Entertainment and Recreation

Although not a necessity to some non-field officers and accountants
who are away from the front lines, most unit members will
agree – bases that have no outlet for recreation are nightmare
assignments. Gymnasiums, an arcade, even something as simple
as a music-player and a small dance floor can be enough to keep the
members’ minds off the horrible days and nights they occasionally
have to endure. Video fictions, television programs, and electronic
simulation software is available at higher technology levels, and can
sometimes take up a surprisingly little amount of space. These sorts

of facilities can be expensive to arrange on the frontier, but the unit
will be thankful for such small favors.

#### Medical Bays

Often considered to be the most important facility in any headquarters
or home base by the men that live and work there, med bays are
equipped to handle the types of general trauma that a unit might
suffer in the field. First-aid, triage and rudimentary surgery are all
potentially doable in a basic med bay, but more involved processes
could require something more. That is not to say that a base or
headquarters cannot have a medical bay good enough for such
things – it just means that they rarely have the personnel skilled
enough to man specialist bays like those. Beside the commonplace
bullet wound or cutlass gash, med bays are also home to the
pharmaceutical storage bins and any dietary supplements, health-
enhancers or combat drugs the unit might keep. Every unit base
should keep a med bay, medic on hand or not, even if just to have
someplace to keep their trauma patches and anti-pox vaccines.

#### Engineering Workshops

Units that utilise a great deal of higher technology devices or have
skilled technicians amongst their members will to have dedicated
workshops. Places where a demolitionist can put together the
charges the strikers will need in the morning, where the recruits
can mill out gauss ammunition by the ten-gross batch, or where an
expert could crack open a captured enemy computer to see what
secrets it holds. These sorts of workshops are always good to have
if there are personnel to use them, but quickly become additional
storage when a unit does not.

#### Motor Pool or Hangers

Units that have frequent vehicle visitors or own vehicles themselves
will have areas set aside specifically for them. Tools, parts, fuel and
all of the necessary space to repair and re-arm vehicles is a must
have for a good motor pool (ground vehicles) or hanger (gravs and
flyers). There are usually dedicated workers that spend long hours in
these areas, checking out the vehicles and making sure that they are
ready for action the next time each one is commandeered for use.

#### Training Areas

Considered expressly useful in cadre camps and recruit compounds,
training areas are not often high on the priority list of facilities to be
added to most other bases. These add-ons can come in the form
of weight rooms, gymnasiums, shooting ranges, computerised
simulation chairs, basic desk-and-teacher classrooms and a variety
of other specialized facilities. Training areas are remarkably useful
for long term base accommodation and unit schools, but not too
much at a frontier base or guerrilla outpost.

#### Stockade/Brig

Space in most bases is a prized element, and not given up freely to
friends – let alone prisoners. A unit base that creates a dedicated
prison facility is expecting to take prisoners for one; for two, they
do not mind giving up room that their members could be using.

### HHHEEADQUARTERSEAADDQQUUAARRTTEERRSS AANDANNDD M MMIILITARYILLIITTAARRYY B BBAASESASSEESS

Sometimes a prison area is useful for when members get drunk,
drugged or otherwise out of hand; they can be a real danger if they
reach their weaponry or have a disagreement with their comrades.

Other than unruly personnel it is unusual to have many prisoners on
a base, normally specialist facilities are constructed for prisoners,
either for any enemy taken captive in war or personnel convicted of
criminal acts.

#### Other Facilities

This category of possible base facilities is a miscellaneous collection
of the minor add-ons some military and mercenary units could want
to build or bring into their own bases and headquarters.

- Religious altars, artefacts or chapel areas
- Alternate atmospheric quarters for alien guests or members
- Negotiation offices for ticket or governmental administration
- Biological or chemical laboratories
- Psionic testing facilities
- Duelling arenas (primarily Aslan units)
- Rentable guest and visitor housing

## BASE AND HEADQUARTERS

## FACILITIES THROUGH THE ERAS

Depending on the unit that designed them and the area in which
they are placed, military bases and mercenary headquarters vary
greatly. As technology increases, so too does the complexity and the
utility of the facilities involved. If anti-gravity and jump technology
are available, it is not likely that a unit will choose to still live in
a frontier fort made of stone and timber. Sometimes however, it
simply cannot be helped.

This section describes the various facilities that may arise at the
different Technology Levels of _Traveller_. Of course there is nothing
stopping a higher-technology unit from bringing their advanced
facilities to a lower-technology world. Many of the sections give a
narrative example or two of what could be described as a common
instance for that Technology Level, and likely further into the future
as well.

#### Technology Level 0

A planet that is populated by hunter gatherers, unable to construct
complex equipment or civilizations, cannot hope to host domestic
mercenary or military forces – let alone bases. When your dominating
populace is just learning the applications of fire and simple tools, the
formation of these kind of groups are impossible. These primitive
people group together for survival reasons.

#### Technology Level 1

As the sentient population of a planet begins to form cities and
civilizations, conflict will almost invariably result. Expansionist
behaviours, civil wars, and competition for resources brings about

the need for soldiers. This need leads to standing armies, and those
armies must have places to congregate between campaigns.

With such limited technologies at their disposal, armies equipped
for close quarter or limited ranged combat march for months to get
from one place to the next. Living in ‘tent cities’ while on the march,
these early armies took their bases with them – creating the facilities
where they go, as they need them. It is horribly inefficient, but it
serves the primitive culture well enough.

With the advent of standing armies comes the first mercenary units,
travelling from conflict to conflict or hired out by some chieftain
for protection as much against his internal enemies as his external
ones.

#### MILITARY TENT CITY

The closest thing to a proper ‘base’ in these barbaric times, the
generic term of tent cit y actually represents any of the early command
locales that primitive armies made use of. An area of personal tents,
lean-tos, and open air bedrolls marked where the army is calling
home for the moment. A larger command tent or cabin is where
the officers planned the army’s battles and maneuvers, and some
better organised armies might have a tent or cordoned area set
aside for the wounded and dying.

#### Technology Level 2

The unearthing of sciences and advancement of government creates
a better environment for a centralised armed forces and different of
military units that have specific needs. Archers require dry storage
for their bows and arrows, cavalry need stables, and knights look
to armorers for their heavy armor. The beginning of cannonade
artillery and simple large-bore guns shake the battlefield.

With the advent of new weaponry and fighting tactics comes the
need to train soldiers to use and fight against them. In order to
do this efficiently and without too much hassle, armies use keeps,
compounds and castles dedicated to the armed forces. Experienced
soldiers could teach a hundred men in a courtyard, sending the
recruits back to their cots when it was over to begin anew in the
morning. Horse training and the use of wagons and carts allow for
the faster movement of troops, and the requirement of taking all of
an army’s assets with them was far less prevalent. It was just as easy
to send for supplies as needed, normally coming from the nearest
friendly stronghold.

Mercenaries become more common at this point. Small groups of
former soldiers occasionally band together in numbers, meeting
under one title or another to sell their services to the highest bidder.
The term ‘sellsword’ is coined, and small groups of mercenaries
fight alongside regular armies.

#### MILITARY KEEP AND COURTYARD

A typical gathering point for an official armed force in this technology
level, a solid keep will be a large wood and stone structure with

### HHEEADQUARTERSADQUARTERS AANDND MMIILITARYLITARY BBAASESSES

a central building, several smaller attached buildings, and often a
low wall surrounding the entire courtyard area. The central building
is where the army’s leaders live and plan, or where important
equipment and documents are kept. Additionally, the top of this
often-taller structure is used as a lookout point, overseeing the
entire compound and many kilometers around if possible.

Additional buildings will be barracks, equipment or food storage,
and several more specialized locations that the army might have
need of. An apothecary or barber’s room (medical bay equivalent)
is common, as is a stable (motor pool), or a good blacksmith
(workshop) for making repairs to weapons and armor. The need
for additional services was beginning to grow for the advancing
technologies of the army, and a basic keep shows it.

#### MERCENARY MEETING HALL

Without the funds and official leadership that makes a mercenary
unit as viable as they become in later eras, early sellswords gathered
in private drinking halls and meeting houses to discuss their
business. One happenstance leader, normally the man or woman
that created the unit, will give short announcements and take
note of the combat worthiness of his fellows. Members are often
expected to keep up their own equipment and rarely stay together
except when hired in the field. The meeting hall is not much of a
‘headquarters’, but it is where the unit gathers to arrange their
contracts and other business.

#### Technology Level 3

The birthplace of modern warfare, the introduction of the personal
firearm as an army regular changed warfare – with opposing armies
no longer having to be at spear’s length from an enemy to do battle.
Armies began to use primitive firearms as a standard armament,
and anyone who could afford a musket can potentially sell their
services. Some of the most basic ideas of much more advanced
tactics begin.

Military forces saw the evolution of the stronghold, fort and military
base into dedicated offices and even small cities devoted to the
defence of a governing territory. Huge camps filled with soldiers,
storehouses for black powder and ammunition, and early hospitals
made the organization and operation of a well-established military
force far easier than in past eras. Joining the army of a nation or
government could be a choice rather than a must, and many people
living in squalor or on low means chose to do so just to have hot
meals and a roof over their head more nights than not.

When governments clash, the occasional mercenary unit would
appear to help out for a the best wages they could negotiate. Not
well liked or trusted by the common troops, mercenaries stick close
together and made sure to prove their worth whenever possible.

#### MILITARY COMMUNITY STRONGHOLD

As if the early idea of a keep expanded its walls to surround a small
population, the stronghold is a collection of smaller buildings

arranged all within the jurisdiction of the armed forces. Barracks
houses, equipment warehouses, stables, gunsmiths and field
medics all have their own areas to call home within the huge base
area. There is likely to be set aside quarters and accommodations
for officers and governmental agents, but the majority of the space
will be accessible by the groups of soldiers calling the stronghold
home.

Some soldiers with families are still allowed to live off-base, arriving
each day to train and work as if being in the army was like any
other profession. Because of this coming and going security at the
perimeter of the stronghold – often a fence or low wall – must be
steady and vigilant. Without proper guards and security patrols,
expensive equipment and personnel could walk off the base’s
grounds without anyone knowing.

#### MERCENARY HALFWAY HOUSE

Turning into a way of life for the more adventurous or skilled,
mercenaries begin to realise their potential in knowing how to fight
for money. Buying small homes or warehouses to serve as a general
meeting and planning point for a group of like-minded individuals,
informal halfway houses became headquarters for mercenary units.
They are places where a mercenary can store his musket and his
ammunition, and even as a place to sleep if no other location was
available to him. Elevated members became unit leaders and they
made sure that the halfway house always had the guns, blades and
shot his unit needs.

#### Technology Level 4

Industrialization of a society saw a leaning toward naval combat
and an even more prolific use of firearms as they became easier to
manufacture and operate. Firing rates and accuracy increased, and
an average person could easily become a competent soldier with
just a few weeks of training.

The violent expansionist behaviour of a culture that truly believes
itself superior, having reached its industrial maturity, forced the
use of armed forces to occupy less-privileged areas. The need for
military presences in these new lands created the use of frontier
fortifications, establishing a forceful presence that would remind
the ‘less-advanced’ colonies and conquered civilizations of who is
actually in charge.

Units of mercenaries in this era knew how to make the most of the
industrialising culture, using their leverage of being hired to do
what the expanding militaries can. A mercenary unit that was well-
equipped and could take care of its own weapons and ammunition
could sell their services to the highest bidder.

#### MILITARY FRONTIER FORT

Set up in the wake of a culture’s industrial bloom, this form of
military base actually seems like a step backwards in time for the
most part. Built to house and serve the needs of the military while
pushing the boundaries of their nation forward, they are not always

### HHHEEADQUARTERSEAADDQQUUAARRTTEERRSS AANDANNDD M MMIILITARYILLIITTAARRYY B BBAASESASSEESS

the most carefully laid-out locations. Built where the resources allow
it, the fort is supposed to be the forward outpost, forging the path
for more permanent residency when the local area is safe. This can
mean that a fort that succeeds can be updated with new supplies
from the main body of the armed forces, but are often little more
than walls and barracks space.

#### MERCENARY STOREHOUSE AND WORKSHOP

Mercenary units come to realise that their role in conflict has become
less about manpower and more about firepower. The people with the
bigger and better guns were getting ahead in the world, so a good
mercenary headquarters look like an engineer’s workshop half of the
time. Many members of the unit would stay in the workshops at all
times to half-work and half-protect the equipment, and nearly every
new recruit would be responsible for learning a useful trade. All the
normal amenities of a mercenary headquarters would be there as
well, but the constant need for new weaponry filled the empty hours
between getting hired to fight.

#### MERCENARY GUERRILLA HIDEOUT

As the governments and cultures of the era expanded and began
to step upon the rights and freedoms of the soon-to-be-conquered,
some mercenaries focussed on working for the downtrodden.
Creating secret bases and hideouts in the most unlikely of places,
these units of mercenaries had to live with just the basics in their
headquarters. Extravagant or spacious facilities could tip off their
enemies to where they base their operations out of, and the whole
operation would soon be over. So long as they were amongst
the people they were fighting for however, they would have an
inexhaustible source of temporary hideouts for small numbers of
men.

#### Technology Level 5

The addition of easily used engines and real-time communications
revolutionised the lives of both regular and mercenary forces. The
initial use of armored vehicles, although slow and ponderous,
turned every infantryman’s nerves to ice water. Accurate rifles were a
commonplace thing then, but personal gear with near enough punch
to even slow down the earliest of ‘tanks’ was heavy and dangerous
to carry. Airplanes can ferry troops and supplies to faraway places,
and the world suddenly seems a great deal smaller.

Militaries are now able to take huge amounts of troops and
armored support to the battlefield, removing the need for frontier
bases. Advances in medical and engineering sciences allow for
soldiers to receive medical attention in the field, and small hospices
and triage camps can be set up quickly and efficiently. Most military
bases have become large compounds of barracks buildings and
training grounds, with a heavy leaning toward the average soldier.
Some incorporate airfields for rapid supply or deployment trips,
and vehicle motor pools are almost always present in military
structures.

With the kind of resources it takes to build and operate early armored
vehicles, and the dangerous weapons required to combat them,
mercenary companies can not afford to get embroiled in the military
arms race. The appearance of a single tank on a battlefield could
result in the end of an entire mercenary unit, making them unlikely
to fight in large engagements. Small conflicts, assassinations, and
open warfare are far more their style.

#### MILITARY BASE COMPOUND

Designed to serve as the long-term home for several hundred
military soldiers at a time, these bases are much like the older
strongholds – only built with more advanced materials. Barbed wire
fences and machined gun turrets keep the unwanted out, and rows
upon rows of buildings house the soldiers in their respective squads
and platoons. If space permits, a base and its inhabitants can benefit
from an airstrip on the grounds, and frequently several motor pools
hold trucks and armored vehicles to expedite the movement of
ground forces and supplies.

#### MERCENARY URBAN HQ

Even though they could not initially deal with the rapid ascension
of military armored support, mercenaries were still needed in
less affluent areas – especially by those governments who could

### HHEEADQUARTERSADQUARTERS AANDND MMIILITARYLITARY BBAASESSES

not afford their own ‘modern’ armies just yet. Setting up a main
headquarters where their potential employers could find them was
a must, so long as it ensured that their higher-tech competition
could not roll in and deal with them out of hand. The solution was
setting up a single office-style headquarters in an urban area – lots
of civilians around. The mercenaries had little to worry about the
populace – they are openly neutral in most matters – and an enemy
could not attack them for fear of a civilian backlash.

#### Technology Level 6

When self-propelled explosives in the form of rocket-propelled
grenades and air-dropped bombs became a reality, military forces
began to lean very heavily toward their air force to deal with their
enemies. Semi-automatic rifles were becoming the standard
weapon of infantry, and squad-based anti-tank weapons gave them
something to battle against enemy armor. Military ground forces
still made up the majority of a government’s ability to take and hold
territory – but often after the airplanes and naval assets softened
things up a great deal.

Military bases did not change too much in structure, only in capacity
and on-hand equipment. They are still large and self-contained,
nearly all of which now supporting small air force capabilities and
powerful communication arrays. The addition of anti-air guns on
manually-cranked turrets help fortify the base against possible
attack from above, and more efficient tanks and APCs turn any
infantry maneuver into a much faster deployment.

New personal weaponry brought the mercenaries back to the
battlefield in a very big way. Rocket-propelled grenades, anti-tank
guns and personal flamethrowers give non-governmental forces
like mercenary units a chance against armored targets. An enemy
tank still meant a major challenge, but at least now the mercenaries
could potentially deal with the crew inside easily enough. Their
new ability to act on current battlefields allowed them to deal more
openly in most cultures, and the use of mercenary hirelings became
useful again.

#### MILITARY FOREIGN BASE

With the ability to ferry massive numbers of troops and support
equipment across the planet safely, bases can be created on allied,
foreign territories. Advanced communications rooms allows these
extensions of military power to stay in constant contact with the
home government, explaining when supplies were needed – or
when an attack could be eminent. Additional defences are almost
always put into place to make up for the slightly reduced ability to
populate the base, if only due to the possibility that the area the
base is on could become hostile at a moment’s notice.

#### MERCENARY COMPOUND

The scaling and enhanced availability of ‘advanced’ weaponry forced
mercenary units to become a bit more structured in how they did
things. When half of your members have access to rocket launchers

and LMGs it is necessary to begin creating checks and balances.
Officers, and therefore officers’ quarters, become standard fare of a
mercenary base. Secure storage of dangerous equipment is a good
idea, and any salvaged or purchased vehicles have a close eye kept
on them. Other than the uniform a mercenary compound feels a lot
like a military base.

#### Technology Level 7

A government’s military might is now almost assuredly governed by
its ability to inflict massive damage, primarily using bombs, missiles
and offshore batteries. Infantry forces have become self-supporting
squads that can stay in the field for long period. Specialist units like
snipers and combat engineers are elevated to their own positions in
the armed forces, and most governments do not hesitate to utilise
their talents. Rapid-firing automatic weaponry is standard, and most
body armor is to help with occasional shrapnel and flak rather than
direct hits from an enemy’s weapon,

Military bases can now be small cities within their boundaries,
sometimes several kilometers from end to end. The addition of
aquatic vessels large enough to serve as mobile bases for naval
forces brings a new malleability to military command. From a single
aircraft carrier a few officers could direct and lead entire campaigns
against their government’s enemies.

The weapon design and trade industry – both legal and not – flood
the market with potential tools for mercenaries to use. Guns that
were considered ‘top of the line’ a few years before were suddenly
available to be purchased by the gross from smugglers and arms
traders. A good mercenary unit is always only as good as their gear
would let them be, so every mercenary unit sets aside funds and
time to shop for the newest and best weaponry and other equipment
they can find.

#### MILITARY COMMAND CARRIERS

Floating bases built on the largest vehicles to date, a command
carrier is the heart of a military compound with the ability to move.
Whether on a gigantic boat or an enormous tracked land-crawler,
the command assets of a force are well protected by the vehicle’s
weaponry and a large number of allied soldiers that also call the
carrier home. Although they cannot hope to hold as many soldiers
as a stationary compound, the command carrier can easily have
several barracks, its own motor pool, and almost always contains
medical facilities for everyone on board.

#### MERCENARY TEMPORARY BASES

A good mercenary unit realises that it must expand its scope of
potential employers in order to survive, which is very possible with
real-time audio and visual communications equipment. Taking
missions (not yet called tickets) in faraway lands forced mercenary
units to set up small, temporary bases closer to where they would
be acting. Only needing to house the individuals involved in the
mission, temporary mercenary bases are not extravagant.

### HHHEEADQUARTERSEAADDQQUUAARRTTEERRSS AANDANNDD M MMIILITARYILLIITTAARRYY B BBAASESASSEESS

#### Technology Level 8

Even though infantry-based weaponry is still effective against
vehicles, especially with the addition of squad-based missile
launchers and advanced warhead capabilities, ground warfare had
moved primarily to a mechanised state. Infantry moves around in
vehicles, deploy for specific actions and then use their vehicles to
move elsewhere. Rotor craft and airplanes do as much fighting as
infantry platoons, especially when the field of battle was far from
any base.

Mercenary units, too limited to have much in the way of air assets of
their own, keep their focus on the ground. Small conflicts between
local governments or even corporations are a much better way to
make a profit. Wars had simply gotten too big and destructive for
a good mercenary unit to survive, so they hire out to the private
sector. A corporation that needs a shipment to get through an area
safely might hire a few mercenaries to serve as its escort, with other
less savory duties falling upon their shoulders from time to time.

#### MILITARY MECHANISED ROUTING POINT

Essentially a normal military base that is comprised almost
completely of airstrips, hangars, helipads and/or motor pools, a
mechanised routing point is where a military’s forces can upkeep
and ready all of the vehicle assets. Using the vehicles and the
weapons they mount, the routing point is very well defended from
most forms of attack. Although it keeps a much smaller ratio of
infantry to a normal forward base, there are always enough hands
and bodies to utilise the tanks, APCs and aircraft stationed there.

#### MERCENARY COMMERCIAL HEADQUARTERS

When military warfare simply became too dangerous for a common
mercenary unit they began to change their outlook, dealing
with commercial entities. It is hard to invite the CEO of a mega-
corporation to a barbed-wire and gun-turret ringed compound in
the middle of nowhere, so many units began to use less harsh base
structures. Building a common base, all of the normal amenities
(weapon storage, training, and so on) are built inside of an area and
then wrapped in a pleasant (or at least unassuming) looking façade.
A normal office building from the outside could hide a huge force on
the inside – which is exactly how they want it.

#### Technology Level 9

The birthplace of the mercenary ticket, the beginning of gravitic
science and the addition of lasers to the military arsenal are all
major changes. When soldiers begin to carry powerful energy
weapons that can punch through vehicle armor, warfare took a
turn back toward older styles of fighting – the marching forces of
trained infantry. Vehicles still had a place in the overall schematic of
battle, but they became secondary when a handful of soldiers could
put out as much firepower that a small platoon used to have.

Military bases turned back a few decades, returning to the era of
massed barracks and equipment lockers. Massive airstrips and
helipads became secondary to higher-tech workshops and supply
storage. Gravity manipulation and early Jump technology brings
these enhanced infantry units into space.

### HHEEADQUARTERSADQUARTERS AANDND MMIILITARYLITARY BBAASESSES

With so much of the military devoted to space travel and exploration
in an era of re-vitalised infantry use, mercenaries began to pick up
the slack planetside. The opening of business opportunities for
mercenary companies take on a new light as well; becoming a
formal and legal way of dealing with open conflicts. Governments
saw their own military weaknesses and knew they needed to do
something about their shortcomings, leading to the legitimization
of mercenary work – collectively called the ticket system.

#### MILITARY COLONY SHIP QUARTERS

Interstellar travel brings a new avenue of career choices to the
military. When a government plans a Jump expedition they know
they need to have a proper military presence on board the ship.
Barracks space is generally smaller and less comfortable but the
troops will have access to everything that they would normally have
at a planetside base.

#### MERCENARY HQ COMPOUND

As the government legalises and legitimises the use of mercenary
tickets, units no longer have to worry about hiding their activities
(most of the time). A mercenary unit can set up official headquarters
anywhere they can manage, even including some military assets
that they would not have been able to otherwise attain before. Using
their newly acquired governmental contacts, a mercenary unit
can arrange for things like helipads, motor pools, energy-weapon
recharge ports and the like to be added to their compounds. The
unit commanders might need to arrange for better defences in their
base with all of the added facilities, especially with new faces and
potential employers coming back and forth.

#### Technology Level 10

The expansion into space brings the military to new, creating a new
theatre of conflict for mercenaries to profit in. With government
backing on tickets and an increasing ability to obtain high-tech
weaponry, vehicles and equipment, a good mercenary company
could easily become an interstellar business.

Military gear has advanced to the point where a single infantryman
is able to deal with a dozen less well equipped enemies at once, and
most minor conflicts are handled quickly. Military bases in space are
small and efficient to keep down on life-support costs, and with the
advances of personal technology, a few good soldiers could easily
protect a ship or space station in most situations.

Mercenaries also expand into space, taking their equipment with
them on their tickets, returning (hopefully) to the nearest planetside
headquarters to re-equip and debrief. Training as special-service
soldiers and dealing with the ‘grey areas’ that space exploration and
colonization created in laws and politics.

#### MILITARY PLANETARY EXPLORATION BARRACKS

The ability to create a quick base of operations on a planet being
newly explored is paramount to the expansion of a government’s
influence and territory. Potential hazards exist in environments

previously unseen and scouts can only give so much initial
information before the defence forces move in to stabilize the area
for further colonization. The sort of pre-fabricated bases that the
military puts together in these cases are temporary, becoming larger
and more permanent bases as the colony expands.

#### MERCENARY EXTRA-PLANETARY FIELD OFFICE

Designed to be run very cheaply and without too many members
having to live on site, an extra-planetary field office (or ExFO for
short) is a mercenary unit’s first real attempt at setting up tickets
away from their home planet office. A small set up with a good
communications system to arrange plans with the main body of the
unit, the ExFO rarely is home to more than a few field operatives
and a good ticket administration team. They are frequently set up on
larger starships or space stations, giving outsiders a place to meet
with the unit away from prying eyes.

#### Technology Level 11

The galaxy has expanded again with the advent of better Jump
technology, and new sciences – and species – are becoming more
common throughout known space. Authoritarian forces are drawn
even thinner as individual soldiers become better at dealing with
larger conflicts, and fewer and fewer soldiers are required. What
once took twenty men now needs ten, and the occupation of hostile
territory becomes more about who has the bigger guns rather than
the bigger armies.

Interstellar navies patrol the stars, creating some of the first ship-
to-ship battles that were not solely based upon weapons fire. New
advances in armor technology allowed for boarding parties and
hostile breaching actions upon ships in space, and elite soldiers
begin to receive specialist zero-G training. Planetary combat is
much the same, but more effective weaponry increases the need for
more efficient protection.

The ticket system continues to blossom into something that spreads
through to every government and culture that it touches, allowing
for legal mercenary activities nearly everywhere. Travel is expensive
but possible and the growing need for shipside mercenaries to
help with security leads some units to become strictly space-based.
An employer that can afford multi-Jump transit routes can afford
to equip and pay for a few space-trained mercenaries. Mercenary
units begin to much more aggressively recruit ex-members of the
armed forces, turning most units into an excellent mix of skills and
training.

#### Military Breaching Troop Barracks

Always located near the airlock and shuttle systems, a military
unit that has specialist boarding troops garrisoned on a starship
will try to arrange for the troops to have everything they need for
their hazardous duties. Comfortable sleeping areas, fast-access
armoring stations, and personal power pack chargers are standard;
anything to make sure that the ship’s elite troopers are kept ready to
act at a moment’s notice.

### HEADQUARTERS AND MILITARY BASES

#### MERCENARY STARSHIP HEADQUARTERS

With added monetary gains and the ability to request ship shares in
their ticketing contracts, affluent mercenary units are able to cross the
galaxy themselves in search of – or in completion of – work. Unlike a
military starship, a mercenary ship HQ is set up more like a freighter
or trader. Housing is spread through out the vessel wherever it can
be allocated, necessary workshops are placed in the best locations
for the tools and power supplies they require, and unit commanders
keep central quarters and common areas for the unit to interact
socially. Nearby the primary airlock will always be negotiation rooms
and communications chambers for bringing potential employers’
administration agents on board. There is something to be said for
the added security being hundreds of thousand of kilometers away
from anyone brings when the negotiation process begins with a new
client.

#### Technology Level 12

Marines wrapped in thick advanced armor follow the scouts into
the unknown hefting huge plasma cannons that could lay low
their enemies. The first suits of mass-produced combat armor
revolutionises small-unit combat. A single well-equipped marine is
more than capable of taking and holding a position from dozens
of less-advanced soldiers, their expensive gauss rifles making a
mockery of earlier armor. Military operations are often planned
solely around the number of ‘advanced infantry’ that could be
summoned quickly to the battlefield, turning every military outpost
into a veritable stockpile of high-tech equipment.

Units of mercenaries that can not keep up with the technological
race are forced out of the major conflicts, to avoid being shredded
by gauss rifle fire or burnt to cinders by heavy weapons. They
continued to pursue the smaller targets and conflicts – hopefully
those without any major military presence opposing them.

#### MILITARY TROOP OUTPOST

In areas of the galaxy that were rife with unrest and potential
conflict, concerned governments would send in their best military
forces. Setting up small but well-supplied bases at the farthest
reaches of a government’s territories is much like the ancient
frontier fortifications and posts. Enough room for the soldiers to be
comfortable, but packed with more equipment and materials than
most soldiers would care for.

#### MERCENARY LOW-COST SATELLITE HQ

As the costs to keep a mercenary unit running increase along with the
need for more advanced equipment, some units take on a ‘quantity
over quality’ aspect to their work. Sending administrators out to the
far reaches with little more than a brochure and a communications
backpack, these units try to sign on to as many low-end tickets
as their manpower allows. Some lesser sources become frequent
clients and the unit can eventually set up a satellite HQ – a small
office used for ticket and supply administration. There are never any
true active members (other than the administrators) in these tiny
facilities, and they serve solely as a way to set up business away
from the major base facilities. The only thing that a satellite HQ
must have is an adequate communication system; not being able

### HHEEADQUARTERSADQUARTERS AANDND MMIILITARYLITARY BBAASESSES

to seal tickets or arrange for the transport of troops member makes
the office useless to the unit.

#### Technology Level 13

Elite infantry warfare moved up to never-before-seen heights with the
selective introduction of battle dress. Powered, physically enhancing
suits of armor that can carry around tremendous firepower that
was once platform-mounted revolutionises the way that conflicts
are fought. A single solider enveloped in battle dress can stride onto
a battlefield and dominate hundreds of soldiers armed with lower
technology weapons. Conventional vehicles are brought back to the
field of battle in greater than ever numbers, mainly to protect non-
battle dressed soldiers, and heavy weapons become more common
to compensate for this.

Military structures become far more heavily defended to deal
with the enhanced firepower of this new age of warfare. Barracks
facility size per soldier had to be increased to accommodate bulkier
equipment, along with medic bay capabilities to compensate for
the wounds inflicted by the new munitions. Whether a planetside
base or starship compound, infantry capacity was increased and
enhanced.

The mercenary life takes a backwards step once again when battle
dress took infantry warfare to a higher level. Vehicular use had to be
increased to deal with the hard-to-come-by battle dress suits, and
the purchase of field artillery grew more necessary. Mercenary units
without the funds or contacts to deal with the newest technologies
were forced to stay involved only with smaller tickets, which did little
for their profitability.

#### MILITARY BATTLE DRESS BARRACKS

Needing a new type of facility to house the elite, high-tech soldiers
trained to use battle dress; military bases of are forced to make
several small but substantial changes. Reinforced walkways, far
more numerous fusion cell charging areas, and larger workshops to
accommodate numerous suits of armor and heavy weapons rigs
were just some of the alterations. Medical bays became standard
with anti-radiation protocols because of fusion weaponry and the
plasma torch was one of the standard triage tools to open fused
power armor. Although it did not take away from the supplies
needed by a standard combat armor soldier, a modern military
barracks in this technological era required special services for
powered armor pilots.

#### Technology Level 14

Battle dress soldiers are far more frequent, with entire units of
plasma gun-wielding infantry standing defiantly in the path of
conventional firepower. Fusion weapons have become scaled down
to become man-portable for a man in powered armor.

The introduction of handheld fusion weapons requires all infantry
to wear sealed armor or at least take extensive anti-radiation
precautions, and open-air vehicles are almost completely out of use.
The gauss rifle became the standard weapon for a common solider, as

it is the only cheap weapon that can consistently penetrate powered
armor. Military bases become smaller and more compact, taking
into consideration the need for quality soldiers and equipment over
mass numbers. When everyone has similar technology as well, the
only way to set your armor-jocks aside from theirs is the amount of
skill they can muster behind the controls. Training and simulation
modules became standard for military bases, as on-the-field training
is too expensive and dangerous to the rest of the unit.

Affluent mercenary units have the military might of small
governments but dare not use their power to build their own
empires since such a show of force would attract the attention of
more potent governments.

#### MERCENARY STARBASE FACILITY

Although maybe only a dozen existed across the galaxy, major
mercenary corporations are like small governments in their own
regard – governments whose armies are for lease. They keep many
satellite HQs across the territories in which they are active and
numerous planetary bases to serve as local hubs, but the highest
officers of the unit would live and work from floating compounds
called starbases. Space stations equipped with everything that a
mercenary might possibly want, these facilities are a hired soldier’s
dream. Weapons, armor, spacecraft, equipment and the heights of
pleasurable living; they are all found on a mercenary unit’s primary
starbase. Only the higher ranking or famous members of the unit are
ever invited to visit, and only the unit commander and his closest
associates will call it home.

#### Technology Level 15

Man-portable fusion weaponry and meson technology means that
soldiers without powered battle dress have slim chances of survival
on a battlefield, as a single strike from these high-tech weapons
that penetrate conventional armor can disintegrate a body in
nanoseconds. Warfare is more terrifying and deadly than it has ever
been.

The military of such a highly advanced culture frequently uses a firm
‘make peace by preparing for war’ motto, equipping their soldiers
with advanced combat armor and gauss weaponry while flooding
their barracks with battle dress soldiers and FGMP rigs. Grav belts,
G-Carriers and rapid deployment shuttles make conventional
vehicles seem obsolete, and most battles that do not take place in
outer space are fought between platoons of battle dress soldiers.

With warfare becoming as advanced as it has, young governments
and cultures are lost in the wake of larger conflicts. Mercenaries rarely
want to get involved in the biggest conflicts due to the sheer number
of mass-effect weaponry. This means that they have become the
primary armed solutions for lesser governments and corporations
to utilise. Only the largest and most profitable mercenary units can
hope to compete on TL15 battlefields, and many of them simply
choose not to. When a single salvo from man-portable fusion
cannon can destroy many megacredits worth of equipment and
resources, who can blame them for not wanting to?

### EEQQUIPMENTUIPMENT

Unless every group of characters has an arms smuggler or gun-
runner amongst their closest friends, the acquiring of high-tech
military equipment is not an easy one. A good mercenary unit
will frequently take tickets with weapon designing companies
governments just to make good contacts and deals to better equip
them later.

Not all units and freelance teams can be so lucky however.
Sometimes it takes a ‘right-place, right-time’ aspect to get a good
supplier to deal with the Player Characters or mercenary unit, other
times it could be dealing with an unsavory ‘friend of a friend’.
Getting the money to pay for new equipment is only half the process;
the hardest part is finding someplace to buy it.

#### Availability Score

All of the equipment found in this chapter has an additional
statistic that was not included in previous lists. Unless a ‘–‘ symbol
is found, meaning the item is commonly available, there will be a
difficulty number such as ‘8+’ listed for the items. This is the item’s
Availability.

When a character wants to purchase a piece of equipment from this
chapter that has an Availability score, they will first need to succeed in
a Broker or Streetwise throw made at the listed difficulty. Characters
with military or mercenary career terms in their background can
add their current Rank to this check as a DM. If the throw is failed,
the character cannot acquire a way to purchase the equipment this
month. Success means that the character has found a source and
can buy a number of them in one purchase up to his Social Standing
score.

## NEW ARMOR

Unless otherwise noted, only one type of armor can be worn at
a time. Resolve damage from the outside in – damage that gets
through the outer layer of armor is next applied to the inner layer.

PPlate Armor: (TL1)late Armor: (TL 1 ) A suit of forged metal plates jointed and
riveted together to overlap and protect the wearer’s body. The entire

suit is very heavy and unwieldy, but can protect the wearer better
than anything else made in the same technological era. Those
who were fortunate enough to have plate armor fitted for them
often were the hardest soldiers on the battlefield to kill. Due to its
encumbering nature, the wearer of plate armor suffers a –2DM to
any sort of skill throw requiring manual dexterity, coordination or
balance. Wt: 20, Cr 200.

BBallistic Vest (TL8) allistic Vest (TL 8 ) Designed to protect all of the wearer’s major
organs (except the brain), the ballistic vest is heavy and bulky but
offers considerable protection to anyone who uses it. Wt: 1. Cr 200.

PProtec Suit (TL9)rotec Suit (TL 9 ) A slim-fitting business suit woven from
protective fibres, the protec suit is not unattractive and can turn
melee weapons while softening the blow of small arms fire. Can be
worn under other types of armor. Wt: 1. Cr 350.

PPoly Carapace (TL10)oly Carapace (TL 10 ) A bodysuit of fibrous material with adhered
plates of polymer plastics designed to shield major arteries and
organs, the carapace comes with an armored facemask and half-
helmet as well. It is good protection against all forms of damage,
but can be restrictive to individual limb movements. This armor
imposes a –1 DM to all Dexterity based skill rolls. Wt: 2. Cr 10,000.
((TL11) TL 11 ) Wt: 2; Cr 15,000
((TL13) TL 13 ) Wt: 3; Dexterity penalty is removed; Cr 35,000

BBoarding Vacc Suit TL11)oarding Vacc Suit TL 11 ) Also known as boarding armor or
combat suits, the boarding vacc suit was originally used to help
battle against pirates when life support failed during an attack.
It is an armored suit hardened to the dangers of exposure to
vacuum or hostile environments. As technology improved the suits
became thinner and sturdier, revolutionising their use in ship-to-
ship combat. A boarding vac suit will have a melee weapon/pistol
combination grafted to the cuffs on the suit for the wearer’s use.
Wt: 25. Cr 12,000.

### EEQQUIPMENTUIPMENT

AArtillery Battle Dress (TL13) rtillery Battle Dress (TL 13 ) A war-only specialization of the
advanced personal armor, artillery battle dress is powered
combat armor attached to a mounted super-heavy weapon. The
servomotors in the suit are designed to increase the user’s stability
and strength in order to fire its on-board weaponry, increasing his
Strength by +6 while wearing the armor. Damage to the wearer’s
Strength characteristic is calculated as normal, but the value from
the armor are used for all other purposes such as hand to hand
damage or skill checks. On-board computers/2 gives tactical
information and communication, and the suit is frequently outfitted
with numerous upgrades. The suit is fully enclosed, with a five-hour
air supply and gives full protection against NBC (nuclear/biological/
chemical) hazards.

The right arm and shoulder area of a suit of artillery battle dress is
always replaced with one of the weapon choices found in the Options
section below. Adapted for computerised firing by the armor, the
wearer’s right arm is used to operate the weapon system from inside
the suit, and the cost for the weapon is not included in the profile of
the armor. Wt. 28. Cr 250,000.

((TL14) Artillery Battle Dress TL 14 ) Artillery Battle Dress This design is considerably stronger,
giving Strength 16, and has upgrades to its internal systems to give
it computer/3. Additionally, the suit’s left arm has an integral gauss
pistol built into the forearm. Wt. 14. Cr 400,000

#### Options

FFriend or Foe HUD (TL11)riend or Foe HUD (TL 11 ) Several tiny scanners and cameras
implanted in the armor keep track of registered friendly transponders
(the suit comes with 100 transponders) and marks targets without
transponders as enemies. This information shows up on a visor-
based HUD, allowing the wearer to know the exact location of
allies and enemies with his line of sight or up to a kilometer away,
whichever is greater, giving a +1 DM bonus to any Tactics throws.
Friend or Foe HUD costs Cr 4,000. Additional transponders cost Cr
100 for twenty.

GGyro-Stabilizer Rig (TL12) yro-Stabilizer Rig (TL 12 ) This upgrade can be added to Combat
Armor or Battle Dress only, adding a localised motion-pivot at the
waist that counters the effects of recoil at the cost of Cr 10,000. By
spending 1d6 minutes attaching the rig’s arms to a heavy weapon
or rifle, it reduces the weapon’s Recoil number by 2 (to a minimum
of 0).
((TL14): TL 14 ): The TL14 version is internal, affecting any weapon the
wearer is holding. Costs Cr 50,000.

MMounted Mortar (TL11)ounted Mortar (TL 11 )
This upgrade can only be added to Artillery Battle Dress armor.
This adds a single Field Mortar weapon system to the suit, allowing
it to hold twelve rounds for it inside of an internal feed system.
Costs Cr 800.
((TL13) TL 13 ) The TL13 version mounts the TL13 version of the Field Mortar
and holds a capacitor that can fire 50 shots. Costs Cr 30,000.

MMounted AT Gun (TL11) ounted AT Gun (TL 11 ) This upgrade can only be added to
Artillery Battle Dress armor. This adds a single AT Gun weapon
system to the suit, allowing it to hold two magazines of six rounds
inside the armored compartment. Costs Cr 3,000.
((TL14) TL 14 ) The TL14 version mounts the TL14 version of the AT Gun
and uses a capacitor that can fire 50 shots before recharging. Costs
Cr 50,000.

MMounted Frag Cannon (TL12) ounted Frag Cannon (TL 12 ) This upgrade can only be added
to Artillery Battle Dress armor. This adds a single Frag Cannon
weapon system to the suit, allowing it to hold twenty rounds for it
along a belt-fed ammunition system. Costs Cr 4,000.
((TL13) TL 13 ) The TL13 version mounts the TL13 version of the Frag Cannon
and internalises the ammunition system, increasing capacity to forty
rounds. Costs Cr 10,000.

MMounted MRL Pack (TL12) ounted MRL Pack (TL 12 ) This upgrade can only be added to
Artillery Battle Dress armor. This adds a single MRL pack weapon
system to the suit, allowing it to hold twenty-four rockets for it within
an armored drop-feed system. Costs Cr 10,000.

MMounted Mass Driver (TL10) ounted Mass Driver (TL 10 ) This upgrade can only be added
to Artillery Battle Dress armor. This adds a single Mass Driver
weapon system to the suit, attaching it to a rear-feed ammunition
system that comes standard with 100 shots. Costs Cr 4,500.

MMounted MagRail Minigun (TL14) ounted MagRail Minigun (TL 14 ) This upgrade can only be
added to Artillery Battle Dress armor. This adds a single MagRail
Minigun weapon system to the suit, allowing it to hold two-hundred
rounds for it inside of an armored ammunition drum-loader. Costs
Cr 175,000.
((TL14) TL 14 ) The TL14 version mounts two of the MagRail Miniguns,
allowing it to increase its Auto rating to 12. Ammunition loads are
suitably doubled. Costs Cr 400,000.

MMan-Portable Mount (TL12) an-Portable Mount (TL 12 ) This upgrade can only be added to
Artillery Battle Dress armor. This allows for a single Man-Portable
weapon system (PGMP, ARMP and so on) to be attached to the
suit. If ammunition is a concern, the mount holds 100 rounds in an
internal storage system. The mount costs Cr 500 plus the cost of the
Man-Portable weapon.
((TL14) TL 14 ) The TL14 version is able to mount the FGMP. Costs Cr 500.

## NEW AUGMENTS

In a mercenary’s life injuries are, unsurprisingly, rather common.
Because of this, mercenaries are generally at home with the idea
of getting replacement ‘parts’ for what they get blown, shot or cut
off in the line of duty to the unit. Unlike civilians, however, who
might accept a simple cosmetic replacement, mercenaries lean
toward prosthetics and implants that will help them in the future.
Although they are expensive and sometimes unsightly, a mercenary
who wants the best in surgical augmentation will get it.

### EEQQUIPMENTUIPMENT

### EEEQQUIPMENTQUUIIPPMMEENNTT

Most of the items in this category can be cybernetic (mechanical
or electronic implants and prostheses) or biological (genetic
engineering and surgical alternation) or both (a more common
solution), but the general term of ‘augmentation’ is used for all of
them. Like normal, augmentations can bring characteristics above
the normal maximums for his race.

AAdvanced Subdermal Armor (TL12) dvanced Subdermal Armor (TL 12 ) This is an upgraded version
of normal subdermal armor, using even more advanced polymers
and lightweight alloys to line the character’s organs as well as skin.
Advanced subdermal armor still stacks with other protection, but
not other types of subdermal armor.

TL12 Armor 4 Availability 10+ Cr 250,000
TL14 Armor 5 Availability 11+ Cr 500,000

AAslan Cyber-claw (TL10) slan Cyber-claw (TL 10 ) The jointed metacarpal of the character
has been replaced by a cybernetic mechanism and polymer sheath
holding a retractable claw almost identical to the natural weapon
of an Aslan. With a subtle flick of the wrist the mechanism locks or
unlocks the three-inch long steel claw, allowing it to be used as a
deadly weapon. Some Aslan have taken to getting their natural dew-
claws replaced with these augmentations as a sign of their militant
mentality.

AAssisted Ambulation Augmentation (TL13) ssisted Ambulation Augmentation (TL 13 ) By adding tiny
stimulatory conduits in certain muscles and tendons, a person’s
body can be ‘programmed’ to function more efficiently and for
longer. Using the electricity generated from an internal battery
system which recharges itself through the users diet, they can
function at peak physical capability for hours longer than normal.
Depending on the TL of the augmentation, the character can stay
active for longer periods of time, requiring less sleep daily.

BBallistic Tracking Lenses (TL12): allistic Tracking Lenses (TL 12 ): The character’s retinas have
been laced with tiny receptors that link via the nervous system to
the character’s fingers and pulse rate. The retinal receptors place
an outline over any object that the character is currently aiming a

weapon at, allowing for better target acquisition. BTLs (as they are
called) give the character a +1 DM on all ranged attacks. Costs Cr
40,000 with an Availability of 10+. The character’s eyes will shine
strangely in direct lighting, revealing the BTLs to observers.

WWeapon Implant (TL10) eapon Implant (TL 10 ) One of the character’s hands and
attached forearm is replaced with a lifelike framework of alloy and
polymers that has a secret hinged split in it. Opening in two halves,
from between the middle and ring fingers to the elbow, the implant
hides a small weapon that is shielded from most scanners (TL12
and lower). The weapon is modified in structure to fit in the implant
and operates on nervous impulse, but is otherwise the same as its
common counterpart.

MMechanostatic Scanner (TL13): echanostatic Scanner (TL 13 ): One of the character’s ears
have been augmented with a manually activated device similar to
a communications scanner. When activated, any cybernetically
augmented individuals within twenty meters will give off a traceable
buzz that the character can hear. Although this does not help in any
way, it can help the character be aware of augmented threats nearby
his location. Costs Cr 10,000 with an Availability of 9+.

SSmuggling Container (TL9): muggling Container (TL 9 ): A portion of the character’s body
is surgically modified to house a polymer pocket that is made to
look like normal skin. Using a trigger that looks like a blemish or
scar to open, the pocket can hold roughly 10 pounds of weight and
nothing larger than eight inches in diameter. Costs Cr 15,000 with an
Availability of 11+ (due to its illegality). It would take a Life Sciences
or Investigate throw 10+ to discover the container when closed.

## NEW COMMUNICATIONS GEAR

Communication is extremely important to any mercenary unit,
especially when working on a ticket that requires working on smaller
teams or perhaps alone. Staying in contact with the commanding
officer or other teams is vitally important for success and this
requires specialized communications gear.

BBattle Computer (TL 9) attle Computer (TL 9 ) The battle computer is a man-portable
system (backpack weighing 18 kilograms) capable of capturing and
collating intelligence and providing approximations of enemy forces.
It can be linked to untended ground sensors via communication links

to increase its potential and can provide visual displays overlaid on
maps when interfaced with a map box (see below). When attached to
a communicator it can direct a powerful laser communication beam
at one of several preprogrammed targets (such as relay satellites or
tactical communication hubs) and automatically switch to back-up
relays if primaries are jammed or rendered inaccessible. A battle
computer system grants the commander of any battle a +2DM to
all Tactics throws when dealing with a monitored area. Availability
is 10+, cost is CR 100,000.

GGun Cam (TL8) un Cam (TL 8 ) A small rapid-recording camera placed on the
barrel of a firearm, the gun cam is a useful tool for post-combat
evaluation and training. The camera takes several seconds of
recording around the pulling of the weapon’s trigger, allowing for
slow-motion playback to see what the shooter was doing right or
wrong – or the verification of kills. The gun cam costs Cr 150 and
has an Availability of 7+.

TTactical Relay Network (TL6+) actical Relay Network (TL 6 +) A true essential to any large
mercenary unit, the tactical relay network is a fully integrated system
of recorders and transmitters that allow individual active members
transmit important battle information to one another and a central
hub of monitors. The main hub then keeps track of everyone on the
network like the tactical brain of the entire team. Early versions are
simple radio headsets, but at higher technology levels information
like medical readings and ammunition counters can be kept track
of. Through the monitoring of this information, an officer can
manipulate the entire team efficiently. Every participating member
on a tactical relay network can use the Tactics skill of the character
monitoring the central hub, to a limit depending on the TL of the
network.

RRescue Transponder (TL8) escue Transponder (TL 8 ) This device is a high-powered homing
beacon that is worn on the wrist or ankle of the user. Activated with
a quick snap of a safety tag, normally when wounded or captured,
the tracker sends out a nearly constant emergency signal across
several bandwidths to let allies know where the wearer is. It has a
10 km range, lasts twelve hours, has no Availability score, and costs
Cr 50.
TTL 10 L 10 This version is more efficient, raising the range to 200 km
and the cost to Cr 200.
TTL 13 L 13 This version is not worn; it is swallowed and has a 1000 km
range. It costs Cr 750.

RRadio Jammers (TL6) adio Jammers (TL 6 ) First available in base-camp versions, and
then made portable by tech level 8, the radio jammer suite is a static

generator that fills the wavelengths with incomprehensible noise.
The basic models make radio-wave communications impossible
up to 2 km of its location. It requires an Electronics throw with a
difficulty equal to the TL of the jammer to get a single transmission
through. Most jammers are not effective against tight beam laser
communication, however. Availability 8+, costs Cr 500.
((TL 8) TL 8 ) This version is more efficient, raising the range to 5 km and

## NEW MEDICAL SUPPLIES

These supplies are designed for fast and easy use by soldiers and
combatants, likely in the case of being injured on the field of battle.
When hospitals and medic offices are too far to be helpful, triage
devices such as those below could be the difference between life
and death.

AAdhesive Bandages (TL6) dhesive Bandages (TL 6 ) Originally used in small tubes to seal
up bullet holes in flesh in a hurry, this chemical glue is very strong
stuff that essentially turns the moisture in skin to plastic instantly.
The applicators change as technology gets better, but the substance
remains effectively the same. The use of adhesive bandages while
using the Medic skill halves the time it takes to perform first aid,
but incurs a –1 DM to the Medic skill roll. The cost is Cr 10 for a
three-dose tube.
TTL8: L 8 : Cr 50 for a five use spray.
TTL10: L 10 : Cr 75 for a ten use roll-on.
TTL12: L 12 : Cr 100 for twenty use applicator wand.
TTL14: L 14 : Cr 500 for a hundred use gelling gun.

TTrauma Pack (TL8) rauma Pack (TL 8 ) The trauma pack is one of the most useful
carried by battlefield medics. It is a small satchel of chemicals and
drugs used to pump life back in a wounded body. Unsubtle and
deadly in multiple doses, the chemicals can make a soldier ignore
the most vicious of wounds for a few hours – hopefully enough time
to get him to a proper medical facility. The use of a trauma pack
requires a Medic throw 8+, but will give a wounded character back
a temporary 1d6 Endurance. This Endurance can be used to bring
a technically ‘dead’ character back from 0 or less Endurance (so
long as the new total is above 0), so long as they suffered their
last wound within 30 seconds. This regained Endurance lasts for
1d6 hours – at which point it vanishes, potentially killing them. A
character can only benefit from one administration of a trauma pack
per day. Higher technological versions of the trauma pack are not
any more efficient, merely lighter. The TL8 trauma pack weighs 2 kg,
has an Availability of 9+, and costs Cr 750.
TTL10: L 10 : Weight: 1 kg.; Availability 9+; Cr 1,500.
TTL12: L 12 : Weight: 0.5 kg.; Availability 9+; Cr 3,500.
TTL14: L 14 : Negligible Weight; Availability 10+; Cr 7,500.

#### Drugs

There are several drugs (or ‘meds’) that can be used by mercenaries
and their ilk, all of which are legal in the systems in which they are
produced. They likely have some form of combat-based usage, but
some users may have found other recreational reasons for buying
them too.

AAdrenaliser (TL10) drenaliser (TL 10 ) An injected cocktail of alien adrenalines, this
drug is used to keep the user awake and active for several hours at
a time. Although it is known to have a detrimental ‘crash’ when it
wears off, soldiers on patrol duty will sometimes use adrenaliser
to stay alert. One dose of the drug is the equivalent of ten hours
of sleep, after which the user will have 2d6 x 5 minutes to find
someplace to lay down – because the lost amount of sleep will hit

him without fail at the end of that time. The drug has an Availability
of 9+, and cost Cr 150 per dose.

CClotting Aid (TL9) lotting Aid (TL 9 ) This daily preventative thickens the user’s
blood through enhanced platelet levels, causing wounds to clot and
knit much faster. Someone currently on a daily dosage of clotting
aids will give a +1 DM to other people’s Medic throws to treat them.
They have an Availability of 8+, and cost Cr 200 per 30 day bottle.

MMeta-Performance Enhancer (‘Titan Drug’, TL10) eta-Performance Enhancer (‘Titan Drug’, TL 10 ) boosts the
user’s physical strength to superhuman levels. Reacting similarly in
the body to how some narcotics can enhance the user’s strength; the
titan drug does the same thing without all of the same dangerous
side effects. The drug kicks in 60 seconds after injection, and lasts
for around fifteen minutes, adding 6 to the user’s strength (up to a
maximum total strength of 16 for a human). When the drug wears
off, the user’s muscles cramp painfully under the stress and fatigue.
He suffers 1d6 points of damage and is instantly enfeebled (Str of 5
for 1d6 hours). Meta-Performance Enhancer costs 600 credits per
dose and has an Availability of 9+.

NNervous Response Dampeners (TL9) ervous Response Dampeners (TL 9 ) This ‘battlefield vitamin’
is actually a mild anti-anxiety drug, helping combatants cope with
some of the horrors they could be subjected to in war. Taken a few
hours before battle, the dampeners last for a day or so, granting
the user a bonus point of Morale for 2d6 x 3 hours. They have an
Availability of 8+, and cost Cr 100 per dose.

### EEQQUIPMENTUIPMENT

SStarlight Drops (TL12) tarlight Drops (TL 12 ) enhance the user’s vision dramatically. By
adding a few stinging drops of this liquid into each eye and waiting
for the burning sensation to pass, the user effectively gains night
vision equal to that of a nocturnal predator. In darkness or near-dark
environments, the user gains a +1DM on all ranged combat and
perception-based throws. The effects of the drug last for 1d6 hours,
during which time the user’s eyes look silvery and cloudy. A dropper
of starlight drops carries 6 doses (12 eyes), has an Availability of 8+
and costs Cr 500.

#### Medical Care

MMental Therapy ental Therapy Characters that see a great deal of combat,
especially wars, can have their nerves frayed from hours of shelling
and vehicle passes. They could eventually crack under the pressure,
and some need outlets for their stress and internal worries. Many
mercenary units arrange for ‘combat shrinks’ to see their members
at least once a month, just to make sure that they are keeping it
all straight in their minds between tickets. A patient undergoing
regular therapy (at least one session per month) can count their
Morale Characteristic one point higher, and will pay approximately
50 credits per week per Technology Level.

## NEW ROBOTS AND DRONES

Rarely as easy to acquire as a new recruit, drones are good for very
specific tasks that members might be hard pressed to accomplish.
Their use is always governed by the Remote Operations skill, and
some units train their less combatant officers to pilot them from
the rear of a battle.

LLoader Robot (TL9) oader Robot (TL 9 ) These standard battlefield robots are
programmed to take the place of a fallen artillery crewman, loading
the weapon automatically while the crewman gets medical attention.
It still requires verbal commands from the other members of the
artillery team, keeping units from running completely automated
artillery teams. The robot effectively has Heavy Weapons (Field
Artillery) 1. Armor 8, Hull 3. Availability 10+. Costs Cr 80,000.

MMinesweeper Drone (TL10) inesweeper Drone (TL 10 ) Hovering disks equipped with
ground-scanning sensors and concussion generators, minesweeper
drones are perfect for scouring terrain for anti-personnel landmines
and detonating them. The drone has Combat Engineering 2 for
the purposes of finding landmines, and its weapon can set off a
pressure or trip-based mine safely on a basic throw of 8+. Armor 4,
Hull 2. Availability 9+. Costs Cr 95,000.

RRecon Drone (TL9) econ Drone (TL 9 ) About the size of a ground car, recon drones
are equipped with a wide array of radar and visual sensors to map
out a given area. Most recon drones are built as grav units, and
thus are highly manoeuvrable. They can be fitted with up to three
additional types of sensor packages for the appropriate cost, and
can be remote-linked to a battle computer (see below) or other
monitors. Remote drones also come with two hardpoints where
pistols or rifles could be mounted and fired by remote control as
well. Availability 9+, base cost is Cr 200,000.

SSpotter Drone (TL10) potter Drone (TL 10 ) Tiny drones that are little more than a
lift unit and a laser targeter, the spotter is an artillery team’s best
friend. The small spheroid zooms out to where the artillery needs
to fire, spends 1 – 6 minor actions holding a laser designator on the
potential target, and waits for the attack. This requires the drone’s
operator to pass a throw 9+, but will add a +4DM to the designated
artillery team’s next attack roll when shooting at the target. Hull 1.
Availability 8+. Cost Cr 12,000.

#### Options

SSelf-Destruct: elf-Destruct:
Explodes as per a frag grenade with a 5 meter radius when directed
to do so with a Remote Operations throw 9+, but increases the
drone’s cost by 25%. The high cost is to protect the drone from
accidental or enemy self-destruct activation.

## NEW SENSORS

Sensors used by mercenary units are often limited to a practical
use in or after conflict. Many are adapted to be used with the
helmet HUDs of well-equipped units, others use more traditional
computerised sensors found in recon vehicles or command unit
backpacks.

EEnergy Emission Warning Beacon (TL13) nergy Emission Warning Beacon (TL 13 ) The stationary ground
sensor (EEWB) is designed to predict incoming energy weapon
fire by ‘listening’ to the hiss of superheated air splitting when
high-energy weapons are fired. Although this will not help in close
quarters or basic fire fights, it can be very helpful at longer ranges.
Any character hooked up to an EEWB feed adds an additional –1DM
to attackers using energy weaponry at Long Range or farther when
they react. Weighs 4.5 kg, Availability 10+, cost Cr 60,000.

FForensic Sweeper (TL13) orensic Sweeper (TL 13 ) This complicated handheld device is
a multi-medium scanner that looks for radiation residue, ballistic
particles, chemical traces, and bio-organic remains all at once.
Within an hour of sweeping a twenty square meter area with the
handheld wand, and succeeding in an Investigate throw 8+, the
device will know all of the following pieces of information. Weighs 2
kg, Availability 10+, cost Cr 7,500.

- The types of weapons fired in past 36 hours
- The known species of any beings passing through the area in
    the past 12 hours
- The known species of anyone injured in the area during the
    past 48 hours
- If any chemicals (drugs, poisons and so on.) were in use during
    the past 12 hours

AAnti-personnel Equipment Scanner (TL10): nti-personnel Equipment Scanner (TL 10 ): This bulky set of
goggles is used to search a person’s body for metallic, plastic or
ceramic devices – such as guns, knives, or explosives. By looking
at a target with great scrutiny (1–6 minutes) within five meters,
the character may make an Investigate throw 8+. If successful,
the goggles penetrated the target’s clothing/armor and found all

inorganic devices in or on them. Weighs 1 kg, Availability 9+, cost
Cr 10,000.

#### Options

HHelmet Reader (TL9) elmet Reader (TL 9 ) A single type of sensor feed can be
wirelessly fed into the eyepiece HUD of a basic combat helmet with
this option. Cost Cr 250.
TTL10: L 10 : Can receive up to three feeds at once. Cost Cr 500.
TTL11: L 11 : Can receive up to five feeds at once. Cost Cr 750.
TTL12: L 12 : Can receive up to eight feeds at once. Cost Cr 1,000.
TTL15: L 15 : Can receive information from unlimited feeds at once. Cost
Cr 5,000.

## NEW SURVIVAL GEAR & SUPPLIES

Mercenary unit members are sometimes asked to live for weeks,
months or even years in the. In order to make their lives easier in
these sometimes hostile environments, corporations have made
several advances in survival equipment and supplies.

CChemical Sniffer (TL9) hemical Sniffer (TL 9 ) Using a sophisticated air/liquid-intake
device, the sniffer computes what sorts of chemicals are found in
the air of an area. The process takes only a few minutes, and can
detail specific elements in the sample taken. It is designed with large
buttons and switches for the thick gloves of a vacc or environmental
suit. Availability 7+, costs Cr 2,500.

PProtein Tap (TL9) rotein Tap (TL 9 ) A crank-operated augur and press attaches
to large plant or animal life and pulps organic matter into an
unrecognizable paste. Although the basic pastes produced by the
tap tastes like the source of the material, most tap-users carry
syrupy flavors to add to the substance. The device adds a +1 DM
to all Survival skill checks made to ‘find’ food in the wild. Cost Cr
1,000.

MMap Box (TL9) ap Box (TL 9 ) Originally designed for wilderness exploration,
the map box is a compact storage system for computer generated
maps of a world. Scale may be adjusted by hand using a few button
presses or voice commands (TL11 or higher). Most inhabited
planets have insert wafers available for Cr 150 each that will update
the box appropriately. When not available, two orbital sweeps of the
world are required to obtain the necessary photographs to construct
a map wafer. Blank map box wafers are available for Cr 30. The use
of a map box grants the user a +2 DM bonus to all skill throws
involving direction and navigation of the mapped planet. The cost of
a map box (with one planet preprogrammed) is Cr 3,000.

NNuclear Dampers (TL13) uclear Dampers (TL 13 ) A common term used to describe
safety devices built against nuclear weaponry, dampers units are
actually used to decrease the stability of atomic nuclei. By projecting
a localised field from two separate stations (one master and one
slaved), a wide area of altered isotopic energy is produced – seeking
out the unstable nuclei of weapons-grade materials. In the area of

the fields, the strong nuclear force is depressed, making the nucleus
much less stable. The fields are primarily designed to be focused on
incoming nuclear warheads, causing them to rapidly shed neutrons
at low energy levels, rendering the warhead inoperable as its core
material disintegrates on an atomic level. Any nuclear devices that
are not currently already in a state of fusion (fusion cells, starship
cores, etc.) will have a penalty of the Effect of the damper operator’s
Computer skill throw to any attacks made. The range of the damper
field is proportional to the distance separating the two stations. At
tech level 13, the ratio is 100:1 (a separation of 50 meters between
stations would give a field range of 5 kilometers). Each damper
station weighs 75 kg, and the maximum distance the stations can
be apart before the field disperses is 200 meters. Availability 11+,
cost MCr 5.
((TL14) TL 14 ) As above, and the ratio is now 500:1. Availability 12+, cost
MCr 10.
((TL16) TL 16 ) As above, and the ratio is now 1,000:1. Availability 13+, cost
MCr 20.

PPurifier Tabs (TL6) urifier Tabs (TL 6 ) These small chemical tablets are dropped
into potentially questionable water, turning up to one gallon of it
into drinkable (perhaps not tasty) water. The process takes only a
few minutes, and turns the water an off-blue colour. The tablet only
purifies natural contaminants, not synthetic poisons or toxins. Cost
Cr 10 per tablet.
TTL10: L 10 : More advanced chemicals will even isolate and purify man-
made toxins and pollutants. Cost Cr 50.

TTent-barracks (TL8): ent-barracks (TL 8 ): A large tent providing shelter for eight people
against the weather and environment. The pole structure requires 1

- 6 man hours to set up properly. Weight 10 kg. Cost Cr 500.
((TL10) TL 10 ) The TL10 version can be effectively pressurised using a
chemical seal from the inside. There is no actual airlock – the tent
depressurises when it is opened. Availability 8+, cost Cr 5,000.

#### Options

AArmored (TL9) rmoured (TL 9 ) Survival structures (tents, habitats and so on)
can be layered with the armored option, granting Armor 5 to
those inside from attacks originating outside of the structure (and
vice versa). This triples the weight of the structure. Availability 9+,
Cr 2,500.

CChameleonic Fibres (TL12) hameleonic Fibres (TL 12 ) The chameleonic fibres upgrade
can be given to tents, habitat modules and other basic structures.
The structure gains the benefits of advanced camouflage. The TL12
version bleeds heat excesses to match the background infrared
levels and effectively renders those inside invisible to IR sensors
(Hard (-4) to detect with sensors)). Availability 10+, cost Cr 8,000.
((TL13) TL 13 ) The advanced TL13 version uses both the IR and Vislight
camouflage technologies, adding light-bending technology to the
structure, making everyone inside nearly invisible to the naked eye
(Hard (-4) to spot)). Availability 11+, cost Cr 60,000.

### EEQQUIPMENTUIPMENT

SSpring-blade (TL4) pring-blade (TL 4 ) A thin-bladed dagger set into a spring-loaded
or hydraulic sheath located on or around the forearm, used for
surprise attacks. Spring-blades have a +2 DM for their initial surprise
attack, but suffer a –1DM for parrying.

MMonoblade (TL8) onoblade (TL 8 ) A light one-handed sword with a polymer blade
honed to a monomolecular edge by the mechanisms in the supplied
scabbard.

#### Bludgeon Weapons

MMace (TL1) ace (TL 1 ) A heavy weight at the end of a short haft sometimes
spiked or flanged.

SSap (TL2) ap (TL 2 ) This melee weapon deals 1d6+1 stun damage in addition
to its normal damage. A character struck by a sap must make an
Endurance check. If this Endurance check is failed, the character is
knocked unconscious.

#### Primitive Projectile Weapons

Ancient technologies provided early peoples with good ways of
hunting and defending themselves. A peasant with a bow can kill
an armored knight or soldier with a careful aim and a single,
inexpensive arrow.

Attacks with primitive projectile weapons use the Athletics (archery)
skill.

BBow (TL1) ow (TL 1 ) A stout but supple piece of wood carved to a specific
shape and strung with a piece of cord, string or gut to increase
tension. The string is pulled back and released to hurl an arrow
long distances with surprising force. At higher technology levels,
bows are modified with additional strings and pulley systems to add
accuracy and power.

CCrossbow (TL2) rossbow (TL 2 ) A horizontal bow set into a mechanical firing
mechanism and stronger-than-normal pull, crossbows are very
powerful weapons that are very time consuming to reload. At higher
technology levels, crossbows are built with crank and pulley systems
that make the weapons easier to reload, even self-loading at TL9.
reloading a TL2 crossbow takes 6 minor actions, at TL4 this is
reduced to 3 minor actions.

## NEW FIELD TOOLKITS

Some technical and specialist skills require specific tools of various
kinds. These tool kits contain everything that a character would
need to fully utilise the skill. All field tool kits have an Availability of
9+ and weigh roughly 5 kg.
CCombat Engineering – ombat Engineering – cost is equal to Cr 50 times Technology

## NEW WEAPONS

If there is one thing that is sacred to a mercenary, it is that there is
no such thing as too much firepower. The need for bigger and better
weaponry has put the ingenuity of weapon designers across the
galaxy to the test. Personal weaponry like pistols and knives are fine
for a few spacers getting into a scrap with a small band of pirates,
but they will not do much good on a battlefield. When artillery shells
start to fly, it takes a different grade of weaponry to survive amongst
the chaos of war.

This section is devoted to these higher-grade weapons often found
in the armories of militaries and mercenary units.

#### Blade Weapons

Although units across a battlefield rely heavily on their firearms to
win their wars, a good stout blade at their hip is always welcome
when the enemy closes. Not all mercenaries are into full-scale
warfare either, and a thin-bladed knife can be an assassin’s best
friend.

AAxe (TL1) xe (TL 1 ) A heavy wedge-shaped blade at the end of a stout haft,
normally wielded in two hands to deliver powerful chopping blows.

SSpear (TL1) pear (TL 1 ) A long haft of wood tipped with a sharp end, used to
thrust into a target. Can also be used as a Thrown weapon with a
+1DM to hit.

SStiletto (TL2) tiletto (TL 2 ) A long, thin blade used to puncture rather than slice.
Often 30 – 40 centimeters in length for reaching organs.

#### Slug Throwers

ZZip Gun ip Gun A one-use pistol made from makeshift materials, the ‘zip
gun’ is a catch-all title used to describe any one-shot homemade
firearm. Zip guns have a -1 DM to attacks.

FFlechette Pistol lechette Pistol A small and light pistol that uses air pressure to
all-but-silently hurl tiny slivers of metal with great accuracy. Often
considered to be an assassin’s preferred sidearm due to its inherent
quietness.

CCartridge Pistol artridge Pistol A revolver-style pistol that fires shotgun
ammunition at very close range. It comes standard with an attached
arm brace to help absorb some of the considerable recoil created by
the weapon’s discharge.

MMagRail Pistol agRail Pistol Using the basic MagRail principle of much larger
weaponry, this pistol magnetically projects five-centimeter diameter
alloy discs at astonishing velocity. Although it has a slower rate of

fire due to the limits of its attached power pack, its munitions can
cut through armor and flesh with ease.

AAntique Carbine ntique Carbine A breach-loading short rifle-like weapon often
used by horsemen or cavalry to fill the role between pistols and
rifles. Unless the weapon is especially well made, it will have a -1
DM to attacks. Antique carbines require a successful Slug Carbine
check to reload.

AAutocarbine utocarbine Fast firing slug throwers that only require one hand to
fire, but can be terribly inaccurate without a second hand to steady
it. Autocarbines are considered to be a good standard firearm for
most security forces.

FFlechette Carbine lechette Carbine A short-barrelled weapon capable of shooting
metallic flechettes at longer ranges than the standard pistol.

AAccelerator Carbine ccelerator Carbine Also known as a gyrojet carbine, accelerator
carbines are designed for zero-gravity combat. They discharge tiny

missile munitions that leave the barrel with minimal velocity and
recoil before accelerating to higher impact speeds.

GGauss Carbine auss Carbine Not as bulky as the gauss rifle, gauss carbines fire
high-velocity projectiles using electromagnetic rails. Gauss carbines
are the favored weapon of boarding marines because of their size
and ease of use.

MMagRail Carbine agRail Carbine Using the attached power cell to augment firing
rate, this carbine projects the same five-centimeter diameter alloy
discs as its pistol version. It uses a larger magazine and a more
rapid fire rate, but does not increase the velocity or the ‘calibre’ of
the projectiles.

SSniper Rifle niper Rifle A high-calibre rifle designed not for rapid firing, but
instead for penetration and visceral damage. With its integrated
silencer (see _Traveller_ core rulebook page 102) and magnification
scope (see below), long-distance targets can be killed quietly and
efficiently.

FFlechette Rifle lechette Rifle Much like the normal autorifle, the flechette rifle has
a decent rate of fire and moderate takedown potential. Its metallic
slivers punch through lightly armored targets easily, making it a
good assault weapon when dealing with common infantry.

MMagRail Rifle agRail Rifle With the larger frame of the rifle stock, a larger
power source can allow for even larger ammunition to be hurled

#### One-Handed Carbines

Carbines are designed to be fired in one hand with relative
ease, but it is harder to keep them under control when doing
so. Because of this, carbine weaponry has two listed Recoil
numbers. The number found in parentheses is the Recoil of the
weapon if being fired in one hand.

alloy discs shot by the MagRail rifle can tear humanoid targets apart
in seconds if held on target.

#### Energy Weapons

As technology increases, the users of that technology must adapt
alongside of it. Only the most affluent and technologically savvy
mercenary units can hope to use energy weapons on a regular basis.
They are deadly, powerful, and above all else – expensive.

FFusion Pistol usion Pistol Using advanced directional gravitics, the fusion
pistol projects a small blast of fusion energy from its attached power
source at respectable ranges. Those without radiation protection
who are in Personal range of the weapon when a fusion pistol is
fired will suffer a moderate dose of radiation – each firing of a fusion
pistol emits 1d6x5 rads.

SStagger Laser tagger Laser The first energy weapon designed to effectively hurl
multiple shots, the stagger laser actually just uses an industrial
beam splitter to create the effect of several smaller beams in place
of a single solid one.

### EEQUIPMENTQUIPMENT

MMatter Disintegrator atter Disintegrator This weapon was designed for killing heavy
infantry, plain and simple. The science behind the weapon is easy;
cause the target to shed neutrons at an alarming rate, using its own
matter against it. The larger or more dense a target is, the larger
the reaction. The Effect used with a matter disintegrator is not
determined by the attack roll; instead it is equal to the Armor rating
of the target – meaning that the weapon will always inflict damage
if it hits.

#### Grenades

Useful for clearing bunkers and trenches without putting oneself in
direct danger, grenades are fantastic ways of dealing with several
enemies at once. All grenades (including those listed in the Traveller
core rulebook) can be purchased specifically for the use in a grenade
launcher.

EEMP: MP: Electromagnetic Pulse grenades are used to knock out drones,
robots, computers and electronic equipment. Any unshielded
electronic technology caught in the radius of an EMP grenade will
automatically shut down for 1d6 minutes unless equipped with
shielding to prevent this. Few high-tech mercenaries use these
devices due to the erratic nature of their effect radius - which can
effect their own gear on occasion.

IIncendiary: ncendiary: Incendiary grenades deal 1d6 heat damage to
characters within three meters of the blast; the radius is considered
to be ablaze for 2d6 minutes – inflicting 2d6 fire damage to anything
that enters the area.

Plasma: Plasma grenades use two chemical agents and an
electric pulse to start a massive reaction in the grenade’s shell,
causing it to explode in a small orb of superheated gas.

#### Heavy Weapons

The finest in man-portable heavy weaponry, a mercenary unit that
frequently takes wartime tickets will likely have several members
devoted to the upkeep and use of heavy weapons. While not as
powerful as support weaponry, like that found in emplacements
or on artillery battle dress soldiers, a single ‘heavy’ in a mercenary
squad can make a remarkable difference in a fire fight.

FFlamethrower lamethrower A pressurised tank of combustible fuel attached to a
projecting nozzle, the flamethrower shoots a long stream of burning
liquid and flame at its targets. When fired, the flamethrower’s stream

strikes a single target and expands in all directions to consume
it and the area around it. The fuel does not puncture armor like
a bullet, but instead coats the target in burning fuel – which will
continue to blaze for several seconds. As technology advances the
type of fuel becomes more efficient, eventually reaching the point
the of blue-white plasma thrower at TL14.

In game terms, a flamethrower attack targets a single point of
impact within range, making attack rolls against everything in a
straight line from the firer to that point (rolling in order) – stopping
when an attack hits. When the stream hits a target however, it
breaks the projection and becomes a radius of 3 meters around
the target, rolling the damage for the weapon as normal. Anything
that suffers damage from a flamethrower will continue to suffer
half (round down) the current damage value every round until the
damage is halved eventually to 0. Due to the lack of penetration
to a flamethrower’s stream, armor values are doubled against
flamethrower attacks.

LLight Machine Gun (LMG) ight Machine Gun (LMG) A heavier belt fed version of the
automatic rifle, the LMG fires standard ammunition at staggering
speeds. Ammunition is provided in 100 round belts. Reloading
requires six minor actions if the weapon is manned by a single
individual, two minor actions if a dedicated loader is present. If a
loader is present, he may choose to link two 100 round belts to
form a 200 round belt on the spot as a minor action. This may not
generally be done ahead of time as each belt is carried in its own
ammo box. Linked 200 round belts are often provided ahead of
time if the weapon is emplaced in a defensive structure or is vehicle
mounted.

LLight Assault Gun (LAG) ight Assault Gun (LAG) Essentially a superheavy rifle, the LAG
fires a single solid slug at extreme distances with anti-armor
penetration capability. A magazine containing five rounds is inserted
into the underside of the weapon, ahead of the trigger guard, and

locked into place before firing. The weapon comes standard with
both a manually set tripod and an over-the-back sling to assist in
carrying from place to place.

AArmor Rifle, Man Portable (ARMP) rmour Rifle, Man Portable (ARMP) Designed to be the epitome
of sniper rifles, the ARMP is a single-shot, bolt action heavy rifle
that can puncture the plate armor of personnel carriers. With the
integrated bio-mass range finder (see below) and adjustable pivoting
bipod, an ARMP properly set up with a proper line of fire can kill a
target that thinks it is safe behind cover. Little can withstand a well-
aimed direct hit from the ARMP’s specialized ammunition.

AAuto Cannon uto Cannon A gravity fed, fully automatic weapon, the auto
cannon fires a large-calibre round at amazing velocities with a
practical rate of fire reaching 200 rounds per minute. Ammunition
is provided in two large drums, placed to either side of the firing
position. Empty drums may be changed independently of one
another by a secondary loader, allowing the weapon to be fired
while being reloaded. Replacing an ammunition drum requires the
normal 6 minor actions, but is doubled to 12 if performed while the
gun is being fired. This ammunition system is so heavy, that the
weapon must be mounted on a vehicle or emplacement to be fired
effectively.

VVRF Gauss Rifle RF Gauss Rifle Standing for Very Rapid Fire, the gauss rifle is a
shoulder-slung gauss weapon that uses an attached power backpack
to accelerate hundreds of metal darts per second at targets several
over a hundred meters away. Generally only carried by soldiers in
battle dress, the VRF gauss rifle is a heavy rig that must be set on a
stationary pintle-mount if it is to be fired by any character outside
of powered armor.

MMagRail Minigun agRail Minigun Modified to fire steady streams of twenty-
centimeter discs of sharpened metal, the MagRail minigun
does not use revolving barrels like conventional slug-throwing

miniguns, although it does have four individual firing ports. It uses
a compartmentalised energy cell to direct the individual barrels
to fire in alternating patterns, drawing from a single drum-sorted
ammunition feed located under the weapon’s rear.

#### Options

BBipod/Tripod (TL4) ipod/Tripod (TL 4 ) Any weapon that has been fitted with a
stabilizing bipod or tripod can be set up in two minor actions to
halve the weapon’s Recoil (round down), so long as the weapon is
not moved. Costs Cr 50.

MMagnification Scope (TL4) agnification Scope (TL 4 ) When Aiming with a rifle, the firer can
reduce the effective range of the attack for the purposes of DMs by
up to 2 range bands. Costs Cr 25.

BBio-Mass Range Finder (TL10) io-Mass Range Finder (TL 10 ) Using sophisticated density and
IR recognition scanning, the computerised scope draws reliable
outlines of where living targets are, despite up to twelve inches of
inorganic material between target and firer. This eliminates up to 2
points of DM penalty from Cover. Costs Cr 500.
TTL12L 12 3-D imaging and motion tracking is added to the scope. This
eliminates up to 4 points of DM from Cover. Costs Cr 750.

#### Support Weapons (Field Artillery)

Rarely used outside of a battlefield, field artillery is one of the most
effective ways of dealing with large groups of soldiers or heavily
armored targets. Operated by teams of skilled technicians (or a
single man in artillery battle dress), artillery systems are not to be
trifled with.

FField Mortar ield Mortar A simple aiming and firing mechanism based on
self-propelled rounds being dropped into a tube, the field mortar is
primarily used to drop parabolic attacks into the rear of an enemy
formation. At TL8, the fragmentation shell has been re-designed
to be more aerodynamic. At TL11 the mortar actually uses a power
pack to create charged balls of energy to launch into the enemy.

Ammunition for the field mortar cost 50 credits per shot, except for
the power pack fuelled TL11 version.

AAT Gun T Gun The single best way to deal with an armored target, the
Anti-Tank gun is a huge cannon that fires a single armor-piercing,
high-fragmentation shell that is designed to punch armor and
explode. At early technology levels, the gun is called a ‘howitzer’ and
is used to lob shells in wide arcs. As technology increases, the AT
Gun’s ammunition becomes more and more efficient as it is made
from better materials, allowing it to be fired more like a conventional
gun. At TL15 however, the AT Gun is fired a directed plasma lancet
of energy drawn off a huge fusion pack attached to it by cables and
conduits. For the earlier versions, ammunition for the AT Gun cost
25 credits times the Technology Level.

FFrag Cannon rag Cannon A high-calibre parabolic cannon, the frag cannon is
used to launch special anti-personnel rounds over a battlefield. The
rounds explode when they reach a certain falling velocity, hurling
thousands of chunks of superheated shrapnel into the masses
below. It is a weapon that cannot be used in areas where allied forces
might be, as the airbursts are not easily contained. As technology
increases, the frag cannon becomes more computerised and easier
to manage with fewer crew. Ammunition for the frag cannon costs
50 credits times the Technology Level of the weapon.

MMRL Pack RL Pack The multiple rocket launcher pack is a rack of motorised
launch tubes that uses the same ignition system to rapidly deploy
payloads. Earlier versions used simple ‘aim and fire’ rockets that
required several crew to load, direct and fire properly. As technology
increased, the MRL becomes a radar-controlled automated system
with contained loading systems and laser-guided rockets. MRL
packs fire either single shots or a number of rockets as a separate
attacks roll up to half (round up) the pack’s Technology Level,
and have a rate of fire equal to three times the number of rockets
launched. Missile reloads cost 25 credits multiplied by the TL of the
MRL pack each.

#### Field Artillery Rules

The usage of field artillery in Traveller are often powerful pieces of equipment that are not easily transportable, requiring multiple
characters to run properly. To show this, there are two important statistics for each piece of artillery. These are described below.

EEffective Range ffective Range Field Artillery is designed to fire at very long ranges. The number listed is the farthest the target of a Field Artillery attack
can possibly be, suffering no penalties at that range. Firing at targets up to +50% of that range will suffer a –4DM to hit. Anything farther
can not be hit at all.

MMinimum Range: inimum Range: Either due to how difficult to physically manipulate or due to the requirement of parabolic firing arcs, some weapons
are extremely difficult to fire at close ranges. For every range band closer to the firing weapon than what is listed, the attack suffers a –4
DM to hit.

RRate of Fire: ate of Fire: Artillery is difficult to fire rapidly due to reloading and re-aiming constraints. The number listed is the amount of minor
actions that must be spent preparing the weapon before firing again; treated similar to a Reload score.

MMinimum Operating Crew: inimum Operating Crew: This is the number of skilled Artillerists needed on hand to ready/aim/fire the weapon properly. Each
crewman contributes to the overall firing skill of the artillery piece, figured by taking the average of all crewmen’s Heavy Weapons (field
artillery) skill levels. For each crewman less than the listed minimum, the weapon suffers a –2 DM to hit rolls.

### EEQQUIPMENTUIPMENT

MMass Driver ass Driver This simple gravitic weapon hurls clusters of dense
matter at dangerous velocities. The ammunition used in a mass
driver is little more than metallic or polymer ovoid-shaped pellets
the size of a human fist. Dozens of these pellets are fired in a tight
grouping, striking a relatively small area with tremendous force, like
an artillery shotgun of sorts.

MMeson Accelerator eson Accelerator Using nuclei-stripping technologies originally
discovered for the nuclear dampers protecting many major
population centres in the galaxy, the meson accelerator is a huge
field-focussing device that disintegrates matter caught in its focused
energy emissions. The ‘beam’ fired by the accelerator is actually
invisible except for its effects, but the weapon’s designers added a
harmless light-projection system to colour the area of effect a bright
blue immediately before it fires – allowing allies to steer clear of the
coloured area!

## VEHICLES

Mercenary units must get from place to place in order to fulfil their
tickets, requiring them to either borrow transport vehicles from their
employers or purchase some for themselves. Also, having access to
some heavily armored assault vehicles can make all the difference
in some combats.

AAssault-cycle ssault-cycle A semi-enclosed, one-man armored motorcycle
that moves at very high speeds while allowing the rider to fire twin
LMGs at targets that it passes by.

GGunskiff unskiff A mobile, gravitic gun platform that lets its passengers fire
their weaponry over the somewhat precarious railing. Sometimes
used to ferry troops, but most often used as firepower platforms,
gunskiffs are a favorite of the Aslan – who also use them to deploy
assault troops.

HHovertrak: overtrak: A bit of a misnomer, the hovertrak anti-armor tank has
no ‘trak’ portion of it at all. It was originally named for the tracked
version of its chassis, now obsolete with the advent of its hovering
capabilities. Fully enclosed and supporting a small anti-personnel
weapon, the main reason the hovertrak exists is to support its
powerful anti-tank cannon turret. Few mercenary units can afford
these behemoths, but those who can will never be without a job.

GGravcopter: ravcopter: Fast and agile, the gravcopter uses two small gravitic
generators located to either side of the passenger cabin to propel
itself across the sky. It is lightly armored and armed, mainly used
to deliver troops to hard-to-reach places very quickly.

HHydrofoil ydrofoil A fast-moving boat that actually lifts above the water on a
set of ski-like ‘foils’, this is the best watercraft for aquatic assaults.

CCarry-All arry-All A huge helicopter with four massive rotors positioned at
the corner of its expansive crew and cargo compartment, the Carry-
All is the best way to bring a single platoon to a specific point of
interest safely – albeit slowly. The passenger limit listed is an utter
maximum, and can be reduced by bringing other vehicles within
the cargo hold of the Carry-All. Every Hull point worth of vehicle
carried by the Carry-All takes up three passengers worth of room.
Unfortunately, the Carry-All cannot have the Deployment Ramps/
Harnesses option added to it.

AAssault Capsule ssault Capsule A cylindrical vehicle designed for tunnelling
under enemy lines to deliver soldiers, the assault capsule can take
a squad through solid rock rather quickly. Using a dozen individual
and spinning plasma-cutting devices, the capsule liquefies the
ground it draws itself through. It can be used above ground like a
slow-moving car, but it is better suited for underground travel. The
second Speed score listed is for its tunnelling rate.

### EQUIPMENT

RReflec Covering (TL11) eflec Covering (TL 11 ) The vehicle is coated with the expensive
Reflec armor polymer, a plastic made with layers of reflective
material and heat-dispersing gel. It is highly effective against lasers,
increasing the Armor rating by +5 against laser weaponry, but
provides no other protection against other attacks. Once the vehicle
has taken half (round down) of its Hull points in damage, the Reflec
has torn free or burnt off, and the bonus no longer applies. This
costs 1,000 credits times the sum of the Armor and Hull ratings
of the vehicle.

AATGT: TGT: The _All Terrain Gun Transport_ is nothing more than a tracked
weapons platform. It carries two powerful fusion cannons into battle
and allows the gunner to fire them in tandem, shielding both driver
and gunner from the dangerous radiation such weapons produce.
Some replace these weapons with a single meson accelerator, but
such weapons are still semi-experimental and too expensive to
risk.

#### Options

RRadiation Shielding (TL8) adiation Shielding (TL 8 )
The use of fusion weaponry has increased on the battlefield
dramatically in higher-technology areas, and a troop transport could
easily be killed by the ambient rads on a battlefield if they are not
careful. By using special alloys and aerosol medications in the crew
passenger compartments of a vehicle, it can render all passengers
immune to radiation while on board. This adds +10% to the vehicle’s
cost and can only be used on enclosed vehicles.

EECM Shielding (TL9) CM Shielding (TL 9 )
The advent of electromagnetic pulse grenades have made fast-
moving, especially flying, vehicles dangerous to use – as that an
ECM stall could be fatal! Vehicles that purchase this option are
immune to the effects of ECM grenades and effects. This costs 25%
of the vehicle’s total cost, and can even be added to a grav belt.

DDeployment Ramps/Harnesses (TL4) eployment Ramps/Harnesses (TL 4 ) By adding fast-action
ramps or repelling harnesses to a vehicle, the passengers inside
can exit the vehicle in a much faster fashion than using common
routes. The vehicle with this option can deploy all of its passengers
in a single 1 – 6 second action if the vehicle is held steady. This costs
100 credits per passenger-capacity of the vehicle.
