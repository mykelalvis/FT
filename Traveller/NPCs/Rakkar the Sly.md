Rakkar was born on Oziz, in the Thoengling Empire, a poor world at the coreward edge of Gvurrdon. Although small for a Vargr, she soon impressed the more aggressive members of her pack with flair and cunning, showing a natural gift for getting her way through trickery. Aged just 19, she managed to dupe the captain of a corsair out of their ship and leave her homeworld, successfully impersonating the former captain for almost a year. The crew were so impressed by her brio that they unanimously accepted her as their own.

She has since risen quickly to become the leader of a sizeable corsair fleet, her name and likeness displayed on wanted screens across Gvurrdon, the Spinward Marches and Deneb. An inveterate risk-taker, she is far from satisfied with her achievements to date. With the fortunes of hundreds of Vargr and dozens of ships resting on her slender shoulders, she is constantly on the lookout for the next big score or elaborate con to lift her fame to an even greater level.
