### Dim

The primary star and mainworld share the same name in this system: the star due to its weak luminosity and the planet for the prospects of its  citizens. Dim is a cold, mostly barren world, far outside the habitable zone of the system, its star a distant speck that provides little in the way of light or heat. The system’s largest gas giant, Oaf, is at the tipping point of becoming a brown dwarf and approaches the size of Dim, the star. Oaf and Dim orbit a close common barycentre, the two cosmic bodies engaged in a tightly spinning dance with one another. The other planets of the system, including Dim itself, are circumbinary and therefore orbit both the star and gas giant. The planet Dim is not tidally locked with its primary star, which is unusual in a red dwarf system. At some point in its distant past, Dim may have been struck by a planet nearly its own size, giving it a rotational period of about 12 standard days. The collision theory also explains the presence of a reasonably thick atmosphere and large amount of water, most of which is frozen to a depth of several hundred metres.

Life on Dim is, well... not bright but the world does have some intrinsic value. It is located on the extensive Lishun Main, which wends its way from Ameros into Shinkan and continues two subsectors into Fornast sector before it finally terminates. Traffic on the main is high and Dim’s modest starport is designed to facilitate trade as best it can. The central pod of its highport is a busy thoroughfare where freight and speculative cargo flows from ship-to-ship. Low-tech robots, large and small, scurry about transporting cargo modules, product samples, mail pods and other materials between wheeling and dealing merchants. Visitors learn to watch their step lest they be run down in its narrow streets.

Free-market shenanigans aside, Dim’s top commodity is information. Dim is an entry point into the Core and as such serves as a launchpad into the markets of the sector. Some may dismiss borders as ultimately just imaginary lines but most tramp traders are quick to point out that there is something different about the Core’s worlds. They have a unique culture and way of doing business. Newcomers to the sector or Travellers who have returned after being away in Fornast or Antares for a while come to Dim to get the lowdown on current events. The liquor may be cheap at Dim Highport but the talk is not. Its numerous taverns, speakeasies and dive bars are crowded with Travellers who trade information on any number of topics.

The surface of Dim is barely populated. The world’s metal and mineral reserves are poor although there are a few small operations that scratch out a living mining copper, aluminium and tungsten. Its main industry is ice cracking: robotic extractors obtain the ice, crack it for hydrogen and ship it up to the highport where it is sold in its unrefined state. There is no downport on Dim, just a small spaceport that is fit only to dock small craft.

Dim Highport Cargo Robot
Dim cargo bots of various shapes and sizes
are a common sight at the Highport. These
robots may be rented by the hour and used
to retrieve small lots of cargo from the
central hub or other ships docked at the port.
Most are designed to be remote controlled
by individuals, but some have preset
programming and a list of daily tasks which
they doggedly perform with little regard for
pedestrians on Highport thoroughfares.
Travellers must take care to watch out for
these lumbering drones as accidents occur
from time-to-time.

Operating a Dim Highport cargo robot
without trampling innocent bystanders:
Difficult (10+) Electronics (remote ops) check
(2D minutes, DEX).
