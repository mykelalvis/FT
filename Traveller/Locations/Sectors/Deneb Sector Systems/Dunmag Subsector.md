The 28 star systems of the Dunmag subsector are, for the most part, arranged as variously sized clumps with jump-2 vessels required to transit between them. This creates a set of small local economies that have links to other, similar groupings. Whilst not as conducive to economic growth as a major main or cluster, these conditions did permit a modestly powerful economy to develop in the subsector before the Imperial [[Civil War]].

During the 'bad war' phase of the war in Deneb, many worlds suffered major damage with population centres and industrial sites attacked from orbit. Some worlds – notably [[Andalia]], [[Twinian]] and [[Pagamin]] – were rendered all but uninhabitable. The consequences of this damage went beyond the boundaries of Dunmag; the destruction of economic assets created a hole in the middle of the sector, which later absorbed goods that could have been sold elsewhere. While the damage was considerable elsewhere, the damage to Dunmag was bad enough that it affected the reconstruction of the whole sector.

Today, Dunmag is a market more than a producer of goods and its position between [[Inar Subsector|Inar]] and [[Atsah Subsector|Atsah]] further contributes to this status. Trade ships from the larger economies of the sector compete for business in Dunmag, sometimes to the benefit of the locals, who can negotiate a good deal or benefit from one major player undercutting another to reduce market share. On the other hand, there is little money for investment in high-tech or high-value industry in a region with plenty just over the subsector borders.

Dunmag's subsector fleet, the 125th, is concentrated largely in the coreward end of the subsector, with only minor patrol assets based elsewhere. This deployment strategy dates from a time – which some would say has not entirely passed – when corsair raids into Antra (to coreward) were such a problem that the 125th Fleet was routinely expected to provide 'surge' patrolling capability or cover routine deployments whilst the Antra subsector forces launched an attack on known corsair bases.  Proposals to move subsector fleet assets to the rimward end of the subsector have come to nothing, largely due to the expense of building new bases in an area not seriously threatened.
