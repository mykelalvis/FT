Violante is owned by a consortium of wealthy nobles from [[Deneb sector]], whose ancestors, foreseeing a time when the spinward regions of the [[Imperium]] would be heavily populated, decided to invest in an unspoiled paradise. The world was parceled into estates with strict controls on population and land use. The world population consists of landowners and their families (about 30% of whom live elsewhere for part of the year), supervisory staff, technicians, and servants.
