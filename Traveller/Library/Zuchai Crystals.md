### ZUCHAI CRYSTALS

An essential part of jump drive technology, Zuchai crystals are an important resource across the whole of Charted Space. The crystals are part of the high- energy sink, or 'jump capacitor', within the drive, focusing the vast amounts of energy required to open a path to jumpspace and form the protective bubble to keep the ship safe. The structure of Zuchai crystals is well suited to energy retention with little bleed when connected properly to the ship's power plant but if the charge is not released properly within several hours there is significant risk of degradation of the crystals. If degraded crystals are not replaced it can lead to the destruction of the jump drive or even a massive discharge of stored energy. Needless to say this is not a good thing for the drive, the ship or the crew.

While lab-grown synthetic Zuchai crystals are widely available, naturally occurring ones have better energy storage properties and last much longer before requiring replacement. A ship's jump drive requires a number of kilograms of Zuchai crystals equal to half its jump drive Power requirement, multiplied by the rating of the jump drive. For example, a typical stock far trader [[TravellerCore#FAR TRADER|typical stock far trader]] would require 40 kilograms of Zuchai crystals. Under normal operating conditions natural crystals remain viable for 40 jumps before they begin to degrade while synthetic ones start their degradation after 25 jumps. Natural Zuchai crystals cost Cr1000 per kilogram and synthetic ones cost Cr750 per kilogram.
