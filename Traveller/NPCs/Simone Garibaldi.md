# SIMONE GARIBALDI

Simone Garibaldi is a young but well-known academic who has become the subject of some controversy in recent months. She holds a doctorate in linguistic archaeology from a highly respected university and achieved prominence after translating the works of the ancient Vilani poet Gaakuuru. Gaakuuru's work was assumed to be lost, with all known examples being quotations or extracts found in the writings of later figures. However, Garibaldi somehow managed to collect enough of his work to fill three translated volumes.

Garibaldi resigned from her university post three years ago and has been out of contact until very recently. Upon resurfacing, she announced that she had been seeking source material, then working on translations for the past three years. She has declined to explain how she came by the lost works of Gaakuuru and will not release the original manuscripts for analysis. Garibaldi says this is due to their age and delicate condition, which is plausible. However, there are those who have their doubts about her story.

Garibaldi's translations were, in general, well received. The quality of the translated manuscripts is excellent; they hold the same power and style of the fragmentary Gaakuuru pieces that have survived. A number of experts initially pronounced Garibaldi's find authentic and the translated works enjoyed wide circulation. Recent controversy has actually increased sales but Garibaldi's professional reputation has been tarnished by claims her works may be forgeries.

There is some evidence to support these allegations. Inconsistencies of style crop up here and there, and there are five separate instances where the manuscripts seem to refer to events that occurred or people who became prominent after Gaakuuru's death. Garibaldi's refusal to produce the originals from which she made her translations has not helped her case; she is currently discredited in academic circles and the subject of divided popular opinion.

The Referee should be the final judge as to whether or not Dr. Garibaldi is, indeed, telling the truth. If the material is a hoax, Simone has turned her talents in Vilani literary history to the production of these forged manuscripts. If, on the other hand, the Referee decides Simone is genuine, she may enlist the Travellers to help her find more obscure manuscripts or prove the works are not forgeries.

Either way, Garibaldi's story is that she came by the originals more or less by accident. She paid a visit to an old Vilani colony world that had fallen into barbarism, out of general interest rather than following a lead.

The writings were contained in an ancient colonial library, which has now become the seat of a powerful local religion. Garibaldi is a little vague about whether or not she had permission to visit but hints that there were other literary treasures there as well. Garibaldi says she has a photographic memory (and can demonstrate this to be true), which enabled her to reconstruct the texts and translate them without removing documents from the library. She does not want to reveal the location of the works for a variety of reasons but with her reputation in tatters she may have to obtain proof that her work is genuine.

There are many ways Dr. Garibaldi might cross the paths of a band of Travellers. She may hire them to transport her to another star system or guard a case, which she says contains the precious originals. If she is a forger, this may be a complex plan to have the manuscripts 'destroyed' in an attempt to steal them. A third party (a rival scientist, her publisher or someone encountered along the way) may hire the Travellers to gain solid evidence that the manuscripts are or are not forgeries. The Travellers may be caught in the middle when someone else attempts to obtain proof of forgery through kidnapping and thus forced to decide whether or not to intervene on one side or the other.

Simone Garibaldi is attractive, extremely intelligent and practical. She is not above using people to get what she wants. In all of her dealings, she insists that the Gaakuuru manuscripts are genuine, although as a rule she says little or nothing about how she came by them except to people she trusts â€“ or wants to appear to trust. The Travellers may never encounter her directly but still be affected by events surrounding her work, perhaps being engaged to obtain the original documents (or prove they do not exist) after someone forces Garibaldi to reveal their location.
