# ENTROPE

Entrope gives its name to the Entropic Worlds, a group of three star systems that have changed owners several times in the past few centuries. Although officially claimed by the Darrian Confederation, Entrope is under occupation by the [[Sword Worlds Confederation]], having been conquered in the Fourth Frontier War.

The political situation is complicated as the [[Imperium]] backs the Darrian claim to the Entropic Worlds, while the Zhodani Consulate supports that of the Sword Worlders. This is more to do with politics and alliances than any belief in the rightness of the claims, and neither side is willing to precipitate an incident by expressing support in more than polite diplomatic terms.

A small world with a very thin atmosphere, Entrope was settled in the distant past and has received additional colonists at various times in its history. Despite the need for compressor masks when working outside and sealed environments for living in, the population grew steadily to the present level, numbering tens of billions.

This huge population is jammed into several enormous city-states with smaller communities between them.
Many of the latter are domed agricultural settlements, although seabed farming is also extensively used.

The cities are heavily and harshly policed to deal with the inevitable pressures caused by having so many people in close proximity and to keep a lid on the world's internal troubles. Society is heavily factionalised, with alliances between power groups forever changing and violence more or less the norm. Usually this is 'kept in the family', in that efforts are made not to cause collateral damage when attacking a rival faction. This is a pragmatic measure as much as anything else â€“ collateral casualties result in resentment and no faction needs any more enemies than it already has.

Officially, the world is ruled by a charismatic dictator.  However, exactly who this august person may be can change, literally, from one week to the next. Whoever comes out on top of the latest power struggle could be referred to as a charismatic dictator in that he or she enjoys considerable support, at least for the time being. However, the political ground on Entrope shifts alarmingly fast.

This factionalization is one reason why the Entropic Worlds have changed hands so often. The world is capable of constructing powerful defences and a viable system squadron; certainly enough to prevent casual annexation. However, some factions are pro-Darrian, others pro-Sword Worlds and still more sufficiently anti-the others that they would rather side with offworlders than see rivals in power.

The current dictator's faction has held power more or less constantly since 1084, although there have been several leaders in that time. Revolutions and counter-coups have been put down with assistance from Sword World troops but not always quickly or easily. At present, the ruling faction is presenting the Sword Worlders as offworld allies invited to help deal with dangerous rebels wrecking Entropic society, a polite fiction that makes occupation more acceptable. There are as many who actively welcome enforced membership of the [[Sword Worlds Confederation]] as oppose it.

Annexation, conquest or liberation by either the Darrians or Sword Worlders has always been accompanied by internal conflict and usually a coup. This has resulted in a great deal of destruction over the years and some appalling tragedies, such as the breach of city segments during political infighting.

The starport was a casualty of the 1084 [[Sword Worlds]] takeover and a short bombardment wrecked the facility.  Although it could be rebuilt using salvaged materials, occupation forces and the current 'popular dictator' have not made this a priority. The Sword Worlders annexed a former industrial spaceport for their military use and do not permit access to any other vessels. Non Sword-World ships must land among the rubble of the former port and make do as best they can.

The outer system represents rich, if hazardous, pickings for salvage crews. The wreckage of battles for control of orbital space can be tracked and wrecks can be a lucrative source of under-the-counter military components as well as more legitimate salvage. The problem is that not only is salvage work in space a dangerous business but the Sword Worlders in particular take a dim view of unauthorized salvage, seeing it as desecration of the graves of honorable dead. Despite this, military salvage goes on and the proceeds often turn up in the seedier starports of the [[Sword Worlds]] themselves. At present, the gains outweigh the risks.

One problem with salvage in the Entrope system is that the system has no gas giants, so obtaining fuel without visiting the starport can be a problem. A jump-2 ship can carry enough fuel to make two jump-1s but the usual solution is to melt ice from a suitable asteroid in the system's belt, then go looking for a suitable wreck with full tanks. This allows a fast escape in the event of a patrol passing by.

Although unlikely, this has happened from time-to-time.  More worrying are tales of salvage crews closing with a wreck only to find that it is not derelict at all but the shattered remains of a previous salvage vessel. Whether these tales are true and whether the victims were destroyed by patrols, in disputes with other salvagers, or by some other means is cause for nervous speculation.
