The Darrian subsector lies entirely beyond [[Imperial]] space, with access requiring either passage through the [[Sword Worlds Confederation]] (not always possible) or transit via an arm of the [[Spinward Main]] and into the subsector from [[Vilis Subsector|Vilis]]-[[Querion Subsector|Querion]] or [[District 268]]-[[Five Sisters Subsector|Five Sisters]].

The subsector itself is dominated by a 15-world cluster centring on [[Ilium]] and [[Mire]], the original area into which the [[Darrians]] expanded when they first discovered interstellar travel. Although many of these worlds were cut off for a long period during the aftermath of the _Maghiz_ , they remained culturally Darrian and were peaceably re-integrated into the [[Darrian Confederation]].

Technically, this cluster lies on the [[Spinward Main]] but since access to the rest of the Main requires transiting through the Gram Arm of the [[Sword Worlds]], astrographical convenience is overruled by local politics.  [[Uniqua]] and [[Garoo]] are also on the [[Spinward Main]], although they lie at the extreme outer end, where the main passes out of [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]] and into [[Foreven Sector|Foreven]] to spinward.

The Darrian people love, and are respectful of, life although not to extremes. As a result, the surface of Mire is a wondrously unspoiled environment, as is Rorre, for similar reasons. Rorre was settled by [[Darrians]]s who disliked technology and preferred a rustic lifestyle.  It was untouched by the _Maghiz_ and life on [[Rorre]] continues more or less as it always has.

[[Torment]] is a prison world, used by the Darrians as a place to dispose of criminals that even their tolerant society cannot accept, with access prohibited in much the same manner as Imperial [[Red Zone]]s. Prisoners mine raw materials in return for necessary supplies.

The world of [[Ilium]] was terraformed by the Darrians before the _Maghiz_ and retains a slight atmospheric taint despite best efforts to remove it. Another tainted-atmosphere world is [[494-908]], which defied the efforts of [[Darrians]] terraformers and is used as a military training area, including orbital bombardment. [[Spume]] also has a tainted atmosphere; this is compounded by the taint being radioactive as a result of natural volcanism. The population live in a sealed mining settlement.
