Fessor subsector is between the two large empires, The 3:rd Imperium and The Zhodani Consulate. (But a bit closer to the Zhodani Consulate.) Both empires try to economically, and otherwise influence the different worlds. The population of the subsector is mostly of solomani origin, and is often more pro-imperium than pro-zhodani. But the total population isn't very large. Just below 3 billion. (2.4 billion at the Imperium controlled planet of Fessor.) The tech-level isn't very high either, since this subsector has been seen as a battlespace for the next frontier war, one has not been really interested to invest too much, and Fessor subsector has become a backwater subsector.

In this subsector there are many rich and agricultural worlds, but this hasn't helped this subsector much. Religion is a strong force in Fessor Subsector, and this have kept some worlds at a lower tech-level than they otherwise would have.

Comments:  
In Alien Realms (Deep Metal) it is said **Parthinia** is 6 weeks from zhodani space. It is here placed six jump-2s from the closest zhodani (not just zhodani client) planet. Deep Metal is about a zhodani diplomatic/trading mission, trying to get a mining contract at Parthinia. Parthinia is also home of the human minor race called The Issigur.

From JTAS 21 (Homesteader's Stand) is the planet of **Lorelei**. This adventure is about a religious cult, that have fled from the religious dictatorship of **Blukjere**, two parsecs away. These refugees have now turned bad, and are terrorising a peaceful farm valley...

Aces & Eights must be one of my favourite Amber Zone adventures. (From JTAS 14) This adventure starts out as a gambling investigation on a luxury liner. It is said that the luxury liner will pass the planet of **Malefolge**...

At **Gwydion** the free trader Themis has crashed. An adventure about the investigation of the crash is found in JTAS 16 (Last flight of the Themis).

Rebel leader Enoc su-Krang has hired a number of mercenary contingents to take over the government at **Pynchan**. In JTAS 7 (Pursue and Destroy) the events of a small mercenary group is played. (Here it is recommended that, Mercenary and Azhanti High Lightning rules are used, but I would suggest Striker rules.)

On **Orval** there is a brotherhood of monks that brew a very good beer. They can be quite violent when defending their brewing secrets.
