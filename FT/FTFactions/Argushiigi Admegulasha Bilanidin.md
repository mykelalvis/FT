# Argushiigi Admegulasha Bilanidin - Traveller

[![Computer-CT-Liz-Danforth-Traveller-Book-pg-70 19-August-2019b.jpg](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/images/8/86/Computer-CT-Liz-Danforth-Traveller-Book-pg-70_19-August-2019b.jpg)](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/File:Computer-CT-Liz-Danforth-Traveller-Book-pg-70_19-August-2019b.jpg)

The Argushiigi Admegulasha Bilanidin, or the "AAB", is perhaps the most respected scientific and research body in [[Charted Space]].

- A literal translation of the name is _"Vilani Repository of All Knowledge"._
- It is the _Galactic Encyclopedia_ of [[Charted Space]] and collects and consolidates [Library Data](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Library_Data "Library Data").
- The [IISS](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/IISS "IISS") classifies any [system](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/System "System") or [world](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/World "World") with a major AAB facility as a code _Ab_ or "[Data Repository](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Data_Repository "Data Repository")."

## Description

Located in the city of _[Ishimaga](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Ishimaga "Ishimaga")_ on [Vland](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Vland_(world) "Vland (world)") ([Vland](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Vland_Sector "Vland Sector") 1717), the extensive AAB facilities include a vast museum, a library, and several research centres and publishing houses.

- The AAB is a privately-funded institution although it has been known to receive Imperial grants from time to time. However, the majority of the AAB's funding comes from private donors, the sales of academic materials, and tuition fees from the [University of Kasiiga](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/University_of_Kasiiga "University of Kasiiga").

### AAB Encyclopedia

The vast stockpile of information to be found here is far beyond that available anywhere else in the [Imperium](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Imperium "Imperium"), and thus the AAB has become a sort of 'clearing house' for new inventions and patents.

- Not only does the AAB collect samples, specimens and recorded materials from all over charted space, it also publishes an abridged fifteen-holocrystal encyclopedia set of its extensive data files. Known simply as "The Encyclopedia," the set contains the equivalent of 7,500 fully illustrated volumes, yet its [holocrystal](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Holocrystal "Holocrystal") can easily fit into a large pocket.

### AAB Research

Although the AAB sponsors very few outside research programs, it maintains a vast network of laboratories on Vland. Due to the often conservative nature of the AAB, researchers who find employment here are likely to be investigating already existing phenomena, rather than breaking new scientific ground. Its giant database is freely available to scholars and researchers who come to Vland.

- The personnel and resources of the AAB also form the backbone of the faculty of the [University of Kasiiga](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/University_of_Kasiiga "University of Kasiiga"). The AAB additionally produces a tremendous quantity of academic materials for the [University of Kasiiga](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/University_of_Kasiiga "University of Kasiiga"), which form much of the content of interstellar university texts throughout charted space.

## History & Background

Soon after the founding of the [First Imperium](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/First_Imperium "First Imperium"), the [Vilani](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Vilani "Vilani") began accumulating knowledge about the societies, technology, and planets of the cultures they came into contact with.

### AAB Trustees

Over time, a governing board calling itself the "Trustees" formed to oversee the many tasks associated with acquiring, storing, and maintaining recorded knowledge from all worlds within [[Charted Space]]. The "Trustees" set up a system by which agents would roam the space lanes acquiring records, or copies of them where acquiring the originals was impossible, and transporting them back to the AAB.

_Well-known Trustees:_ Not surprisingly, several [Vilani](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Vilani "Vilani") families are "Trustees" on the Governing Board, including members representing the:

- [Shiishuginsa family](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Shiishuginsa_family "Shiishuginsa family")

### AAB World Branches

Throughout the First and [Second](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Second_Imperium "Second Imperium") Imperiums, the AAB maintained branch locations on most Imperial worlds. These branches had current copies of the AAB database as well as original copies of locally produced works.

- The [Long Night](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Long_Night "Long Night") destroyed this library system, although some individual branches, as well as the AAB itself, survived into the present-day [Third Imperium](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Third_Imperium "Third Imperium").

#### Active AAB World Branches (1116)

Several worlds have established during the [Third Imperium](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Third_Imperium "Third Imperium") or re-established AAB Branches, many of these are also branches of the [University of Kasiiga](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/University_of_Kasiiga "University of Kasiiga"). They include:

- [Vland](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Vland_(world) "Vland (world)") - AAB and University of Kasiiga headquarters located in the city of _[Ishimaga](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Ishimaga "Ishimaga")_.
- [Gashema](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Gashema_(world) "Gashema (world)") - First AAB and University of Kasiiga branch that serves as a full back-up repository.
- [Shea](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Shea_(world) "Shea (world)") - [Shea](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Shea_(world) "Shea (world)")'s capital ([Urshiiglii](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Urshiiglii "Urshiiglii")) holds one of the largest [MemClip](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/MemClip "MemClip") libraries in all the [Imperium](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Third_Imperium "Third Imperium") - an AAB branch. The University of Kasiiga branch on Shea is a separate city unto itself near [Urshiiglii](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Urshiiglii "Urshiiglii").
- [Shalam](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Shalam_(world) "Shalam (world)") - The AAB Branch on [Shalam](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Shalam_(world) "Shalam (world)") is a repository and research laboratory dedicated to the study of the ancient [Memory Alpha](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Memory_Alpha "Memory Alpha") [artifact](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Artifact "Artifact"). There is no [University of Kasiiga](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/University_of_Kasiiga "University of Kasiiga") branch on Shalam.
