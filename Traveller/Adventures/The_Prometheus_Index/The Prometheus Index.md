# The Prometheus Index 
©2016 Michael Brown 

On a world where education is outlawed, the PCs help steal a database of knowledge to educate the masses.
## Overview 

A world ruled by a ruthless oligarchy of geniuses has outlawed higher education for all except the ruling class. A teacher (considered a terrorist on this world) hires the PCs to sneak into a government facility and steal a database of general knowledge for dissemination to the masses.

The Prometheus Index is designed for tabletop RPG science fiction games using a 2D6 mechanic, starring characters of varied career backgrounds. At least one of the heroes should have some sort of reconnaissance skill. No other skills or equipment are required to play the adventure, although equipment to aid in stealthy movement could be useful.

Monetary figures are given in dollars ($). The referee should adjust for the chosen game system. 

## Players’ Information 

Lud is run by an unpopular oligarchy composed of genius-level intellectuals, as determined by rigorous intelligence testing. The rest are subjected to what is essentially a caste system with their social roles dependent on their test score. Higher education for all but the leaders and the upper caste is all but outlawed; the masses are taught only enough to do their assigned jobs. Teaching any sort of higher learning to the lower castes draws harsh penalties, up to and including death. 

Nevertheless, an insurgent movement has sprung up to combat the blight of state-sponsored ignorance. Teachers -- considered terrorists by the government -- run clandestine schools, using teaching materials smuggled in from various sources, especially offworld. Instructors play a desperate game of cat-and-mouse in their efforts to educate what citizens they can while evading government anti education squads. 

Nunzia Brandt describes this situation to the PCs as they meet with her in a dark corner of a nondescript tavern. She admits to being one of the “terrorists,” and does it because she’s tired of seeing the lower castes being mistreated due to a number on a test. 

She recently learned that the government has moved a critical database of general knowledge to a local secure facility in some nearby mountains. The database, once copied, would go far in educating people en masse. Therefore, Brandt wants to hire the adventurers to liberate the database and deliver it to her, where she’ll have computer experts waiting to copy and disseminate it. For their help, she offers $100,000, which she also assumes buys their silence. She doesn’t lie about the danger; harsh penalties await those who get caught. 

## Referee’s Information 

The secure government facility is a converted castle 700 meters atop a mountain. The site is reached by a winding road up one slope. Numerous signs warn of the consequences of trespassing. The road ends at a gatehouse; two armed citadel guards are on duty at all times, and immediately sound an alarm if challenged by intruders. Eight more patrol the grounds in pairs, with a Routine chance of encountering a patrol in a 15-minute time period. Patrols that encounter intruders call for backup which arrives in 1D6 combat turns. 

The interior of the building hasn’t changed substantially since its days as a castle, although it’s obviously been modernized with power, climate control, and computer equipment. The walls are made of local stone and are in most places at least 1.5m thick. Doors are heavy wood, 1.5m by 2m by 4cm. Windows are little more than narrow slits 45 cm wide fitted with bulletproof glass.

It’s assumed the group waits until nightfall to get the database because the facility is fully staffed in the daytime with all manner of major and minor functionaries, bureaucrats both petty and important, castle staff and administrators, the citadel guards, and the regional leaders. 
1. Regional Genius’ Offices. The Regional Geniuses work here. One’s a workaholic; he’s here at night on 9 or better and will investigate any thing amiss. The heroes find valuables (8 or better, $(1D6 x 1,000)); incriminating documents (10 or better); or a bottle of fine liquor (7 or better). 
2. High-Level Staffers’ Offices. 1D6 are here burning the midnight oil on 10 or better. They sound an alarm if they spot intruders. 
3. Low-level Staffers’ Offices. A janitorial crew is working in here on 7 or better. They attack intruders without sounding an alarm, fleeing if they take 25% casualties. 
4. Security Office. One guard mans the monitors at all times and dispatches patrols to handle alarms. His equipment can be jammed or spoofed (10 or better). 
5. Computer Center. Equivalent to a starship computer and networked. The database is in an armored briefcase behind the secret door at lower right (12 or better to detect), along with other valuable equipment worth $(2D6 x20,000.) The guards have standing orders to kill anyone taking the database without authorization.
6. Administrators’ Offices. The offices of the citadel administrators. The group may find valuables ($1D6x250)), sensitive documents (10 or better), or two co-workers engaged in a secret tryst (9 or better).
7. Tunnel. A seldom-used holdover from the building’s castle days. Seeping moisture has promoted heavy fungal growth which releases a cloud of spores at the slightest disturbance. Treat as smoke grenade and roll 2D6 vs. the main toughness stat or get a respiratory fungal infection. Environmental gear protects.

### Citadel Guards
Tough but not too bright. Competent with pistols and batons (armed with both), and carry communicators. Their uniforms double as light armor.
