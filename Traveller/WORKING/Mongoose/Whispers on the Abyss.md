# I NTRODUCTION

Whispers on the Abyss is a mini-campaign for Traveller,
set in the region around the Abyss Rift within the Lanth
subsector of the Spinward Marches. The Travellers
are tasked with a potentially lucrative mission – to
showcase a new starship variant to potential clients in
the Rhylanor, Lanth and Vilis subsectors. Their voyage
will take them to both iconic and obscure destinations,
and along the way they will come to realise that
something is stirring in the Abyss region.

This mini-campaign is intended for any group of
Travellers. They will not need a starship as one is
provided for their mission. No particular skillset is
required, although the ability to operate a starship
will be useful. Diplomatic and ‘people’ skills will also
be an advantage, as will status or reputation in a
merchant, naval or political field. Travellers of almost
any background or political inclination can play this
mini-campaign but ideally they will have no strong
affiliation as this may make some of the choices to
be made more interesting.

Long-time Traveller fans may recognise some elements
they encounter along the way. Rumours or events may
remind them of classic adventures – a worker’s revolt
on Dinom, a crashed Kinunir cruiser and wild stories
of lost treasure ships somewhere in the Abyss Rift.
Some of these are just rumours of far-off places; others
are hard reality. This does not mean these veteran
Travellers will know all there is to know about these
events. The story unfolding around them is here and
now, not there and then.

Whispers on the Abyss is set in the early days of the
year 1107.

###### INVOLVING THE TRAVELLERS

Whispers on the Abyss begins at Rhylanor starport.
If the Referee wants to build in a job offer to an
existing campaign, this could take place anywhere in
the region, although the default opening of the mini-campaign assumes the Travellers have already agreed
to undertake the mission. There are several reasons
why they might have done this, as discussed under
Traveller Motivations on page 3. It is not necessary for
the Travellers to all have the same motivations; indeed,

it might be interesting for them to have cross-cutting
agendas. Their backgrounds will give them different
advantages and perspectives that might be useful
to the group as a whole, assuming they decide their
loyalty to one another outweighs other affiliations.

If Whispers on the Abyss is to be played with new
Travellers, the contract with the Reidd-Valaasii Starship
Corporation (RVSC) can be their meeting point if they
come from very different backgrounds. There is no
reason why one or more of the Travellers might not
have secret motivations as discussed further on, or
some of their Contacts and Allies might be worked into
the campaign’s backstory.

The campaign assumes the Travellers were selected
for the mission by RVSC. Depending on their
background they might have been headhunted as
experts, applied and got lucky, blagged their way in or
used a favour, or perhaps ended up on the mission by
some unusual circumstance. The Travellers can decide
for themselves, providing their answer is something
plausible, or the Referee can determine their entry
point based on their skills and background.

However they came to be involved, the Travellers
are part of a crew and attached personnel assigned
to showcase a sample of the new Type R2A4 fast
trader, an upgraded version of the ubiquitous Type
R subsidised merchant. Some of the Travellers may
be crew, some experts in their field, and some may
be along because of their sales or diplomatic skills.
Sufficiently eminent people might just be there to lend
gravitas to the proceedings.

Any Traveller can contribute to the mission in their
own way. For crew, it is obvious – they are expected
to make the ship look good and not prang it against
the docking bay wall. Experts can answer queries or
just baffle the questioner with impenetrable jargon. An
Imperial noble or decorated war hero raises the status
of the group just by being there. Someone else might
contribute by being distractingly attractive or laying
down a blistering guitar solo whilst standing atop the
ship’s dorsal bulge. How the Travellers will go about
the mission is up to the Travellers, based on their skills,
their imagination and their chutzpah.

###### REFEREE’S NOTES

The Travellers have a great deal of agency in
Whispers on the Abyss, as is appropriate. This does
mean they may wander off the expected path from
time-to-time. You might be tempted to railroad the
Travellers from one decision to the next and to make
sure they make a decision the way that the campaign
expects them to. That, however, is completely contrary
to the ethos of this campaign and Traveller in general.
The Travellers are captains of their own fate and will
bear the consequences of their decisions.

There is some structure to the campaign as a result of
the Travellers’ mission and the presence of personnel
working for their patron. These characters will make
suggestions or protest actions they do not agree with
and will report criminality or actions that are not in the
best interests of the patron. The Travellers will have to
deal with this in whatever way they see fit.

There are several situations the Travellers could
simply ignore. They may shrug and fly off, deciding
not to investigate the downed starship or get involved
in the revolution on Dinom. There are reasons why
they might or indeed should get involved, including the
possibility of reward from a patron that gains influence
as a result of their actions. The Travellers might simply
feel the call to adventure, or may be smart enough to
realise any situation can be turned to their advantage.

However, some Travellers may have been conditioned
by electronic adventure games into a simplistic ‘quest
giver says do this, do it, collect reward’ mentality.
Human-moderated roleplaying games offer so
much more than this but Travellers may need to be
reminded. For example, the Travellers might see a
newsvid about an incident with themselves front and
centre. They may find their meal is on the house
because the restaurant is honoured to host such
heroes... and can benefit from the publicity. They may
also discover that by getting involved with events they
can make their mark on the cosmos.

Whispers on the Abyss offers the Travellers the
chance to witness or take part in great events that are
beginning to unfold. If the Travellers’ actions matter
in the universe, they are more likely to get involved
and start caring about what happens. Years after the
campaign is over, the Travellers might recall how
they unknowingly took part in the opening actions of
a major conflict. They might even find themselves
wondering if they started it! This is the great reward
waiting for Travellers; the chance to shape the future.

The converse is also true. Travellers who will not do
anything unless someone waves a bag of Credits
will miss out on the chance to be part of great
events. They have complete agency and can choose
to sit on the side-lines or hold out for the biggest
mission reward if they want to. If the Travellers take
that approach, so be it. The events outlined in this
volume will take place without them and the Referee
can always reuse incidents at another time in the
campaign. Travellers who do not get involved will not
be able to influence the course of history.

How the Referee approaches this is a matter of
personal choice. Railroading may be acceptable, as
can offering big wads of cash. However, a Referee
who explicitly or by demonstration shows the
Travellers that their actions make a difference and
that the universe will not wait for them if they do not
act, can draw them into an experience that will be
memorable for everyone. The loot drops and the
mission-end pay-outs are all very well in-game but
the experience of having played that game is what
keeps bringing Travellers back to roleplaying with
others around the tabletop.

###### TRAVELLER MOTIVATIONS

The Travellers’ motivations link to their degree of
accountability on the mission and the type of reward
they can expect to receive.

RVSC EMPLOYEE


The Traveller was already working for RVSC when the
mission was conceived. They may have responded
to a call for volunteers or been ordered to take part.
Either way, they are accountable to the firm and
expected to hold others accountable too. It would
be expected that employees would be loyal to the
company and keen to safeguard its interests in the
hope of receiving promotion and similar rewards.
However, an employee might be disgruntled and
seek a way to pay back the company for some
mistreatment or slight, or to get enough cash for an
early retirement. That cash might come from the
company – legitimately or not – or from some outside
agency. Such an employee might be able to play
everyone off against one another, although they would
need to make enough money to disappear afterward.

##### Introduction



Employee Motivations and Agendas
Agenda Notes
Just doing
my job

The employee has no particular goals
other than to do the job and be duly
rewarded. They will generally act in the
company’s best interests because it is
expected of them and the best way to
get that big bonus.
Corporate
ladder

The employee intends to use this
mission to further their career, whether
honestly or not. They are eager to
be seen acting in the best interests
of the company but may engineer
circumstances or report incidents in a
manner intended to enhance their status.
Turncoat The employee is unhappy with the
company and wants it – or perhaps
some specific people within it – to lose
status and money. The employee may
have already agreed to leak secrets
or sabotage the mission and if not
they will be inclined to do so if an
opportunity arises.
I want out The employee wants to escape from
their contract and retire or move on to
a better life. Successfully completing
the mission might be one way to do
that but if an opportunity comes along
that seems better, the employee may
well take it.

FREELANCE EXPERT


The Traveller is a freelancer in their field, sought out
and hired by the firm for this one mission. These might
be crewmembers but experts in related fields and
skilled lawyers, administrators and diplomats are all
desirable. The freelancer motivation is a good cover
for a plant serving the interests of some political or
commercial concern.

Expert Motivations and Agendas
Agenda Notes
I want a job The expert is hoping to be hired on
a permanent basis or get a lucrative
consulting contract with the firm.
Successful completion of the mission
is important to this but so is being
seen to be of value.
I just want
the fee

The expert is doing a job for
payment. They will be concerned
with maintaining their professional
reputation more than protecting the
interests of RVSC, although often the
two go hand in hand.
I need to
prove myself

The expert needs to demonstrate
their competence, either to
remedy some setback they have
recently suffered or to convince an
organisation they are worthy of an
award, membership or reinstatement.
Cover The expert is using the mission as a
cover for something else. They may be
a Fake, a Plant or both.

Fake

**SAMPLE TRAVELLERS**

##### Introduction

**NOTABLE FIGURE**
A Traveller with a noble title or impressive rank and
military decorations would be an asset, as might
someone whose fame comes from a less formal
source. Notables need to be ‘wholesome’ to be
useful to the mission – a notorious criminal or highly
controversial figure is not an asset to a company
attempting to establish its reliability and trustworthiness.

Notable Motivations and Agendas

Agenda Notes
I was bored The notable figure took the job for lack
of anything better to do. They might
want to travel a bit at someone else’s
expense or get away from previous
commitments. Either way, the notable
is not really committed to the mission
and has little at stake in it. They may or
may not put in much effort.
This is
important

The notable took the job because they
thought it was worth doing. This may
be due to connections with RVSC or
someone concerned with the mission

- which might in fact be one of the

potential clients. Alternatively, the
notable might have a different Agenda,
like wanting to see expanded trade
in the region or improving relations
between worlds along the border.
I am
important

The notable took the job because it
offered an opportunity to show off and
impress people. They are likely to be
prone to risk-taking and showboating,
caring more about their image than the
details of the mission itself.
Cover The notable has a deeper Agenda
but will play one of the above roles
as a cover. They may be a Fake or a
Plant, or both.

**FAKE**
A twist on any of the other motivations, ‘fake’ indicates
that the Traveller does not have the qualifications or
experience to hold the post they have been assigned.
They may have a false identity or blagged their way
into the job. Nepotism and corporate favouritism
are also possibilities. A Traveller might be present
because they come from a noble family and the
company wants their endorsement, or the Traveller
might be a relative of the manager who selected the
team. The fake might work hard to be worthy, or may
coast along doing as little as possible.

Fake Motivations and Agendas
Agenda Notes
Blagging it The fake has managed to land this
plumb job through a combination of
luck, misunderstanding and sheer
cheek. They may or may not have
deliberately deceived anyone but
now their performance is under the
spotlight, their shortcomings are
likely to be detected. The fake might
try to weasel their way out of being
blamed or rise to the occasion.
My family’s
money is
important

The fake is along on the mission
because their family’s money
or connections are important to
RVSC. They could be quite well
qualified or totally unsuited to
the mission but some manager
or other decided to overlook any
shortcomings to get them on the
mission. It is important to the
company that the fake comes out
looking good, which will influence
decisions made by personnel
along the way.
Nepotism and
Corruption

The fake was appointed so they
could add an important mission
to their achievements. They may
or may not be totally unsuited to
the task at hand but someone
at RVSC wants them to be on a
highly successful mission and to
come out looking good. If others
have to lose out, so be it.
Cover The fake is operating under false
pretences. That might be a few
forged certificates or a whole
false identity. How good the
cover identity is may become
significant at some ports of call.
Someone who is blagging it under
the pretence of being a highly
qualified expert but who does
know a bit about their field may
well get away with it until they
have to prove their credentials for
an entirely unrelated reason.

##### Introduction



PLANT


A plant is someone working for an outside agency or
government. Examples include intelligence personnel
serving the Zhodani Consulate, Sword Worlds
Confederation or the Imperium, or perhaps one of
the local nobles or corporate bodies. A plant might
be assigned to actively sabotage the mission or just
gather information. Rival corporations will want to know
what RVSC is doing whilst nobles might have political
motivations. Alternatively, the mission might have
been selected as a cover for agitation or intelligence
gathering about the places visited along the way.

Plant Motivations and Agendas
Agenda Notes
Intelligence
Operative

The plant works for a major
intelligence service, probably Imperial
Naval Intelligence or its equivalent
in the Sword Worlds or Zhodani
Consulate. Their mission may be
to observe the mission or monitor
conditions at various ports of call.
Corporate
Spy

The plant has been inserted by a rival
corporation to steal information about
the ship or the company. Disruption
of the mission may or may not be
on the agenda – stealing secrets is
considered part of doing business but
sabotage is likely to trigger retaliation.
Political
Agent

The plant works for a major Imperial
noble house or some organisation
with an interest in the situation on the
border. They may just want information,
but it is possible that some agitation
might be desirable in the hope of
triggering a favourable situation.
Wild Card The plant has joined the mission for
reasons of their own. These might be
political, monetary or outright crazy.
This person has an Agenda of their
own which may or may not align with
the mission goals.

###### MAKING USE OF AGENDAS

To some extent the Agendas and motivations of the
Travellers are for roleplaying purposes but they can be
used as tools by the Referee. Knowing a Traveller’s
motivations allows side missions and other proposals to
be pitched the right way to the right Traveller and may
create a situation where the Travellers must choose
whose Agenda is to be furthered. The Referee will also
benefit from knowing what will tempt each Traveller and
what is less likely to.

Travellers with certain motivations may have access
to additional information or special treatment in some
situations. For example, someone who has been an
employee of RVSC for 10 years is more likely to be able
to persuade a local representative to help them than
an outsider hired for one mission. On the other hand,
someone with political or intelligence contacts may have
access to information unavailable on the datanets.

##### Introduction

The Travellers have taken a contract with the Reidd-Valaasii Starship Corporation, a medium-sized
corporate body active in the starship customisation and
refurbishment sector. Their mission is to showcase a new
variant of the Type R subsidised merchant to a number of
clients including world governments and corporate bodies
between the Rhylanor and Vilis subsectors.

The ship is based on a major rebuild of the Type R,
creating the unofficial designated Type R2A4 ‘fast
trader’. This is a play on the ‘fat trader’ nickname of
the original Type R, which was designed as a low-cost
means of moving a reasonable amount of cargo along
the mains and in the clusters. The design was a success
and has been in service for a great many years but is
limited by its one-parsec jump range which makes it
efficient in local trade but unable to compete with faster
ships for high-value cargoes. To be fair to the fat trader,
it was never intended to do so and the standard model
fulfils its design brief more than acceptably.

During its long career many variants of the Type R have
appeared. Most are minor conversions, retaining the
standard jump-1 and 1G acceleration performance of
the original and therefore both its limitations and cost-effectiveness. RVSC has long been a source of these
minor conversions but has also created significant
variants with improved performance. The latest of these is
the R2A4, which features jump-2 and 4G capability, along
with internal modifications and enhanced armament.

The R2A4 is primarily intended to serve as a high-capacity secure trader capable of crossing between
mains and clusters but has potential in other roles.
These range from political and diplomatic duties as a
low-cost yacht substitute, to patrol and escort work. A
rescue and salvage variant is planned, with production
of a prototype scheduled for the next few months.

###### STARSHIP SALES REPS

The role of the Travellers, put simply, is to sell the
ship. Not the specific example they are operating
but the concept and the class. RVSC is not looking
to make a few Megacredits selling a single vessel, it
wants bulk orders from governments. There will no
doubt be lengthy negotiations to work through but the
initial impression made by the Travellers will ease the

# T HE MISSION

process or perhaps make it possible in the first place.
Therefore, the Travellers are assigned the mission
of ‘making a good impression’ at every port of call.
In some locations they will meet with local officials to
discuss the vessel.

The Travellers are provided with a marketing package
to be uploaded to the local datanets upon arrival. This
essentially states that the ship is available for order and
invites interested parties to get in touch, along with a
great deal of exciting footage, catchy music and vast
amounts of statistics and technical data. The Travellers
will have to decide how best to deal with requests for
inspections of the vessel or meetings with the crew.

There are certain destinations the ship is expected
to visit and at most of these there is already some
interest. The mission itinerary is as follows:
•	 After a few days to prepare and familiarise
themselves with the ship the Travellers will depart
Rhylanor for Jae Tellona, then cross onto the
Spinward Main at Fulacin.
•	 From there they will proceed generally spinward
on the Spinward Main making stops at Echiste,
Dinomn and Extolay, before making a transit of the
Vilis subsector to Arden.
•	 The planetary government of Arden has ambitions
of becoming an interstellar polity and is interested in
the R2A4 design, so this will be the most important
pitch the Travellers make on their voyage.

In addition to generally making a good impression, the
Travellers are expected to undertake actions intended
to make an order more likely. They may have to put up
with annoying local officials or system patrol personnel
but hopefully the rewards will be worth it. Those
rewards will vary according to the degree of success
encountered. Each Traveller who has joined the
mission will receive Cr100000 up front which can be
spent before beginning the voyage. In addition, there is
a stipend of Cr10000 per month payable by automated
transfer. Essentially, this means ship’s computer makes
a transfer on the last day of the month, drawing on a
line of credit set up for its use. Additional funds may be
made available if a need can be demonstrated.

The real payoff comes at the end of the mission and
depends on how well the Travellers do. Starship
procurement takes time and there is no guarantee that



any agreement in principle will lead to sales. However,
RVSC will pay bonuses based on the Travellers’
performance, which will be augmented at a later date
if sales are actually made. This means the Travellers
might receive significant amounts of money in a few
years’ time. In the interim there is a possibility that
RVSC may transfer ownership of the prototype to the
Travellers if they perform well enough.

Ownership will be subject to certain conditions,
including a contractual obligation not to make RVSC
or the R2A4 design look bad. Apart from that, the
Travellers will own the ship free and clear. They will
be permitted to sell it, subject to approval from Head
Office, or set it up with a hired crew on a suitable trade
run. Even if the Travellers already have a more suitable
ship, the prototype can be a lucrative asset.

###### OTHER CREW

The Travellers will not be operating alone on this
mission. Three personnel have been assigned to assist
and support them, and they will have additional help in
operating the vessel. A new virtual crew system has been
installed aboard their ship, enabling the vessel to be
operated remotely or by a single individual. The system
does not have any sort of free will; it can only execute
orders or follow standing protocols. These include an
emergency return-to-port routine which features automatic
completion of any necessary paperwork and inserting a
request for recovery into the local communications nets.
The ship will then pay necessary fees to avoid being
seized whilst it waits for a crew to reclaim it.

RVSC is open about this being as much a security
measure as a safety protocol. The ship is set up to
make for the nearest port in system in an emergency
and that includes an attempt by the Travellers to make
off with it. The feature will be removed if the vessel is
given to the Travellers but until that point an RVSC
representative can trigger the protocol and disable the
vessel in a manner that will not directly endanger the
crew. Attempts to disable the function or tamper with
the ship’s programming will also result in disablement.

If the Travellers are suspicious about the mission they
may ask – or try to find out by some other means

- why regular RVSC employees are not assigned

this important task. The truth is that the company is
stretched thin but in a good way. Multiple clients are
interested in refurbished or modified Type Rs, and
some of the prospective deals are rather complex. The
R2A4 was put together as a technology demonstrator
for a client who ended up ordering several examples

of a different design. Local management found
themselves with a demonstrator vessel which needed
to pay for itself and decided to try to create sales with it
rather than leave it lying around. In short, this mission
is a piece of opportunism on the part of the company.
It will hopefully offset the cost of building the prototype
but if not little has been lost.

JOACHIM KRYSTALFUCHS


Joachim’s surname translates to ‘crystal fox’ in an
archaic [[Terra|Terran]] language, predictably leading to the
nickname of ‘foxy’, which irritates him to a considerable
degree. He is an employee of the RVSC corporation
and has been with them for nearly 10 years. Before
that he served a term in the Imperial Interstellar Scout
Service, which he hated, and then spent a while on
temporary contracts aboard free traders and other
small merchant craft. Working for RVSC gave him what
he had always wanted; a structure.

One reason for his dissatisfaction with free trader
and scout life was that Joachim cannot tolerate
disorganisation and chaos. He is not a particularly
imaginative individual but finds satisfaction in knowing
what he is supposed to do and being recognised for
doing it. In that, he is a perfect crewmember for a well-run ship – competent, reliable and not prone to having
brilliant ideas that go against policy or the current plan.

Joachim is aboard as a crewmember-in-general. He
can fill several positions, although is not very skilled
in any of them. Normally his role would be routine
maintenance and backup steward, but he can also help
out in engineering or with general tasks aboard the
vessel. He is cheerful and willing to work so long as he
is respected but resents being treated as an underling.

Joachim’s motivation is ‘just doing my job’ and he has
no hidden agenda. However, he is very loyal to RVSC
as he has been well treated during his time with the
firm. He will not go against their interests unless there
is a very good reason to do so or he is deceived,
which he will resent. For this reason Joachim has been
entrusted with an override-all passcode for the ship.
He can, if necessary, lock everyone else out of the
command system and take control of the auto-crew
system. This will enable him to lock himself in a secure
location and order the ship to make for the nearest port
in-system. He is well aware of the level of trust given
to him and feels honoured. He will not reveal any of
this other than in a dire emergency and if the Travellers
have earned his respect he will give them every chance
to resolve the situation before triggering a shutdown.

##### The mission

**STANNEN VAANAII,**

**JUNIOR RVSC EXECUTIVE**
Stannen is a tall, elegant person of indeterminate
gender. They dress in traditional Vilani style when not
wearing the mandated company vacc suit or executive
dress, and occasionally drop quotes in old Vilani into
conversation. This can come off as rather pretentious
but it is an artefact of Stannen’s home society, where
Vilani traditions were highly regarded and every
educated person was expected to be able to converse
in the ancient language. It is unlikely that Stannen has
much Vilani blood in their heritage, placing them in the
category of ‘cultural Vilani’ rather than ‘racial Vilani’.

Be that as it may, Stannen comes from a well-off
background and has an excellent education. This led
to a fast-track career as a junior executive and when
the present mission came up Stannen beat out all

competition to secure a place aboard as the company’s
official representative. Stannen knows they are operating
at a higher level than they are qualified for and has
become a little insecure about it. At times they are
confident and assured they will rise to the challenge;
at others they worry about wrecking the mission with a
bad decision. Travellers who become good friends with
Stannen might act as mentors and help them blossom
into an excellent leader, which will earn them long-term advantages as Stannen rises up the ranks of the
company. Stannen’s Agenda can be taken as ‘corporate
ladder’ with an unhealthy dose of ‘blagging it.’

Despite this self-doubt Stannen is a good diplomat and
a reasonable administrator, and is loyal to the company.
This mission could be a career-making event and
Stannen really wants to succeed for personal reasons.
At the same time they genuinely want everyone to
benefit – the company, the Travellers and the clients

- and firmly believe that ‘good business is good for

everyone’. One problem here is that for cultural reasons

##### the Mission



Stannen is a little too honest for the role and may have
to be... guided... by more savvy Travellers from being
too fair to a client who is not dealing entirely straight.

Stannen is well aware of the emergency shutdown/
return to port protocol but does not know that Joachim
has been entrusted with the highest level of control.
This will not cause resentment if Stannen finds out
but it would certainly be a surprise to find the only
management-level official present can be over-ridden
by a crewmember. Stannen’s home society is rather
hierarchical and such a thing would not be expected.

MANINRA HEISS


Maninra is aboard as a security advisor, which means
she is concerned with the safety of the vessel and the
mission as well as making sure the Travellers do not
wander off with the ship. She began her career as a
steward with Tukera Lines but showed an aptitude
for shipboard security and gradually moved into that
role. Eventually, her experience and skills came to the
notice of a corporate head-hunter and RVSC made
her an offer Tukera was unwilling to match. On the
current mission she has reverted to a poise she used
with Tukera; the helpful and friendly steward nobody
notices. Her brief is to quietly observe and facilitate the
mission when it is going well, offering advice or straight-out shutting down any activity that seems too risky or is
not in the interests of the company.

In-keeping with her role as the near-invisible steward,
Maninra says little most of the time and is just ‘there’ in
the background doing something innocuous. She is adept
at predicting what guests will like and having a perfect
cocktail almost ready just as they realise they want one.
She can also do wonders with even basic starship ration
packs, so with the luxury foods available on this mission
she is likely to create gourmet delights just for the sake of
it. The Travellers will be told that Maninra is the mission’s
security expert but she would consider it a triumph if
they were to forget and start treating her like a servant.
Privately, she would feel contempt for people so easily
duped but she is a stone-cold professional who will stay in
character until the job is complete.

Maninra’s Agenda is ‘I need to prove myself’. Although
she is now an employee of RVSC she came from
Tukera Lines quite recently and needs to demonstrate
she was worth the large salary increase. If the
Travellers dig a little into her background they may
find Maninra a little suspicious, perhaps thinking she
might be a plant sent by Tukera Lines to spy on the
mission. This is untrue but it is close to a different
secret; Maninra is loyal to her new employers but has

agreed to provide information to an Imperial Naval
Intelligence programme which monitors conditions in
the border subsectors. Some of her activities might look
suspicious, perhaps for the wrong reasons.

When engaged in routine shipboard activities Maninra is
not routinely armed but she has a laser carbine and three
semi-automatic pistols in her quarters. Two are compact
concealable weapons which she will usually carry when
planetside; the third is a full-sized handgun to be worn
openly. Maninra has override and lockout access to the
armoury and no-one aboard can countermand this. She
would normally leave the armoury in its default condition –
locked but available to any crewmember upon presenting
their identification to the door security system. Only if she
suspects foul play would she deny crewmembers access
to the weapons lockers.

##### The mission

The following information is for the use of the Referee.
The Travellers will be able to find out some or even
all of it if they make sufficient effort, but there is no
guarantee that everything they discover is true. In
general, the easier a piece of information is to obtain
the less detailed and accurate it is likely to be. It is
possible that deliberate deception may have taken
place, perhaps for political or economic ends or to
conceal an awkward truth.

###### THE REIDD-VALAASII

###### STARSHIP CORPORATION

RVSC was formed in 861 from a merger of smaller
corporations, some of which had been operating for
a very long time. The company makes much of this
ancient pedigree in its promotional materials, although
it has little effect on today’s business. Its head office is
at Deneb, with regional offices in the Spinward Marches
and Corridor. The firm’s main yard in the Spinward
Marches is at Rhylanor.

The company is not a shipbuilder as such. Its primary
market is in refurbished and modified vessels, some
of which are outfitted to order whilst others receive
standard upgrade and modification packages. The
majority of RVSC’s business is in the low-cost end
of the market, selling refurbished free traders and
subsidised merchants to individual clients or small
merchant lines. When a higher-end client wants
a specific conversion they will usually provide the
vessel, although RVSC can buy in a hull and essential
systems, outfitting the ship around its critical machinery.

Standard practice is to buy vessels that have become
uneconomical to refit or which have been repossessed
for mortgage default. Those deemed unsuitable for
refurbishment are broken up for salvage or used for
experimentation but the majority are overhauled and
offered for sale. RVSC can afford to undertake this
work where a private owner might not as the company
has regional outfitting and repair yards. These
standard refurbishments are relatively inexpensive
for a company with long experience of performing
them. Ships are sometimes returned to their original

# R EFEREE'S INFORMATION

layout but more commonly slight modifications are
necessitated by the vessel’s condition. For this reason
a line of outwardly identical free traders offered for sale
may differ internally.

Many vessels are offered for sale at the Rhylanor
installation or delivered to customers across the sector
after being bought from a digital catalogue. In other
cases the firm will be contracted to supply a number of
vessels to a merchant line on a specified time frame.
RVSC is adept at predicting what it will be able to deliver
but occasionally market conditions cause a problem.
This can lead to a flurry of procurement efforts or the
need to buy in ships requiring expensive major refits.

This low-end activity keeps RVSC solvent but the
firm has ambitions of moving upmarket. Some vessel
conversions undertaken are quite expensive, especially
since one-off customisation takes longer than a
standard refurbishment. However, upmarket is where
the money is. The current strategy is to use the more
extensive conversions as the basis for a new line of
upgraded variants. This allows standard hulls and
machinery to be bought in at a reasonable price then
fitted to a higher-end specification.

###### GOVERNMENTAL PROCUREMENT

An individual with funds available can, in theory, just
hand over payment on a starship they like and fill out
the paperwork. Governmental and similar procurement
processes are much lengthier. All decisions must be
justified to a higher authority, with long periods of
discussion in between. This is hardly surprising given
the amounts of money involved in buying multiple
starships and all the other concerns that must be
juggled to produce a final decision.

The procurement process usually begins with the
government, shipping line or other client producing a
statement of its requirements. Just agreeing on this can
be a long process, especially when there are multiple
agencies within the client which all have their own
desires. The details of starship operations might not be
of much interest to a governmental official representing
an industrial or social sector but the effects of buying



those ships will be. Will the purchase create jobs? Will
it bring greater prosperity to certain cities? Could the
money not be better spent on something else?

Different governments may have various ways of
dealing with this process but there are always multiple
considerations to balance. One way to get governmental
departments to agree is a process called offset. Offset
attempts, as the name suggests, to offset some of the
costs of a deal by getting something extra out of it. This
can become very complex and may actually push the
cost up rather than down, but even that can be of benefit
if some of the money comes from a different agency. For
example, a government might offer a contract to build
six in-system patrol vessels, on condition that the builder
also constructs a starport extension at a very low price.
This satisfies other government departments which are
more concerned about trade than security. The starship
builder may be able to undertake the starport job itself
but may have to sub-contract – and that deal might also
be subject to an offset. This all makes procurement very
costly and complex, making offset deals a perfect place
to hide less official parts of the arrangement.

Given the amount of money involved, it is perhaps
inevitable that corruption is commonplace. Bribes
and favours are an accepted part of doing business
in some societies and by a great many people even
where they are supposedly not. Even where direct
bribery is not a factor, many procurement deals are
influenced by politics and personal advancement.
For example, a politician might select one deal
over another for the effect it will have on popular
opinion. Navies have at times had to make do with
inappropriate or underperforming equipment because
a politician wanted to be seen to be ‘tough on military
overspending’. The opposite sometimes happens, such
as when an extravagant deal sails through just because
a political opponent spoke out against it.

Companies operating in the sector must navigate
this minefield and the most successful ones know
how to manipulate it. A given politician might be
incorruptible with simple bribery but could be swayed
by considerations of the benefits a given deal would
bring. New merchant ships mean greater prosperity
and will create jobs in supporting industries, increasing
the popularity of the architect of the situation.

There is no possible way a procurement deal can be
swung on a single skill check. Even if the Travellers
somehow got an official totally and permanently on their
side the inertia of the process prevents instant success.
If they are to sell the concept of their ship the Travellers

must work slowly and patiently, sowing seeds and
moving on to the next target. Procurement is a marathon
at best and sometimes it can become a slog through the
riddle maze of elder wisdom. On the other hand, there
would be no big pay-outs if the job was easy.

###### THE TRUTH ABOUT THE MISSION

The mission, overall, is above board and legal. There is
no double-dealing on the part of RVSC. However, that
does not mean there is no element of politics – internal
to the corporation and on a wider scale – involved.
The R2A4 prototype was developed as a technology
demonstrator, incorporating equipment that various
potential clients had indicated they might like to see. A
few extras were added, either as experiments or due to
the agenda of someone at RVSC. Among these is an
automated intelligence-gathering and analysis package
the company should not have had access to.

There are layers to the mission. Just under the surface is
an agenda to gather information on market conditions and
the state of the shipping industry in the target area. This
is perfectly legitimate in the context of market research;
all successful businesses do something similar. However,
RVSC has co-opted the intelligence package to assist in
this endeavour. Use of a classified piece of equipment for
commercial gain is a violation of multiple laws, although
the firm might manage to get away with it with the polite
fiction that it was conducting a field test on behalf of a
potential client – the Imperial Navy. If RVSC has enough
friends in high places it might pull that off.

There is, however, a deeper layer to the agenda.
The use of the intelligence package for commercial
purposes is a cover for its real intent – to gather military
intelligence on shipping and naval assets in a highly
sensitive area. RVSC is an Imperial company but not
all of its employees are patriots. Some are quite willing
to take money from an unknown client to manipulate
a deal with Imperial Naval Intelligence, and to arrange
for a classified system containing fresh data from within
the Imperium to be aboard a ship headed out across
the border. The Travellers have no way of knowing but
they have signed up to deliver classified equipment to
the Imperium’s old enemy, the Zhodani Consulate.

None of the company personnel aboard know anything
about this – it is a hands-off operation masterminded by
an Imperial noble who is in the pocket of the Zhodani.
Espionage of this sort takes place all the time, with
varying degrees of success. However, the timing of the
‘pinch’, as the intelligence community calls such an
operation, will be significant. Events are unfolding in the
Abyss region that could have long-term effects.

##### Referee's Information

###### THE INTELLIGENCE PACKAGE

The package is a physical device buried deep in
the ship’s computer. Getting it out would require
dismantling the computer and replacing some
components. It is not large, however, consisting only of
a few components that look like most others. There is
nothing about these blocks to indicate they are not an
integral part of the computer.

The package is designed to accept sensor data
from the ship’s systems as well as any information
directly sent to it. This would normally be by way of an
encrypted signal buried in the normal comms chatter.
The device is also programmed with known parameters
of a great many ships and craft. It can extrapolate from
a few fragments of sensor data, gradually building up a
picture of what is around it.

The package cannot ‘see’ anything the host ship’s
sensors cannot but its database allows it to fit the
tiniest pieces of information together. If the host ship is
picking up faint drive emissions halfway across the star
system it would normally not be able to make much of
them other than knowing that something is moving. The
intelligence package might be able to cross-reference
the emissions and create an estimate of what kind of
ship is producing them. Gradually this can be narrowed
down until a class of ship or perhaps even a specific
vessel is identified.

This all takes place at the local level but the package
is also intended for strategic analysis. It knows the
doctrines and standard patterns of movement used
by Imperial and Zhodani fleet assets, and can often
predict a ship’s mission with a reasonable degree
of confidence. Building on this, a picture can be
developed of what an entire fleet is doing; changes in
patrol deployments and the movement of supporting
assets such as tankers can indicate a major fleet
operation. This requires a great deal of up to date
information, however, and predictions become looser
and less accurate when older information is used.

These features are all experimental and subject to
errors at times. The Travellers will not be aware of the
device aboard their ship for most of the campaign but
once they do know about it they may be able to use it to
their advantage. The Referee can use the intelligence
package as a sort of ‘oracle’, providing generally useful
but sometimes misleading information which can draw
the Travellers into new adventures.

##### Referee's Information

The Referee should assume the Travellers were asked
about their preferences when they took the job and the
final fitting-out took place whilst they were en route to
Rhylanor. This means that the Travellers can customise
their vessel a little; when they are presented with the
ship everything they asked for will be in place. At first
glance the R2A4 looks a lot like a standard Type R, the
hull form generally the same, except that there is no
launch riding on the dorsal surface. A bulge, effectively
creating a small upper deck, has been added where
the launch used to be. Depending on the Travellers’
decisions this may have one of two purposes:
additional armament or a luxury suite. The R2A4 is also
in general sleeker than the original design, featuring
retractable aerofins to assist atmospheric manoeuvring.

There are no rear cargo doors, although the hull
styling is such that from a distance it may seem they
are still present. The reason for this is a change to the
propulsion and power systems. The original Type R has
a split engineering section, with cargo space between
the chambers. This can be inconvenient for a lone
engineer, especially when there is awkwardly shaped
cargo in the way, but most functions can be carried
out from a control station on one side or the other. In
short, the split engineering section of the standard Type
R facilitates efficient cargo operations under normal
conditions but in an emergency can impair damage
control or complex operations.

The R2A4 still has the original engineering chambers
but between them is a whole new drive section,
with a fuel tank inserted forward of it. This takes up
a significant part of the cargo deck and makes rear
loading impossible. Forward of this the cargo area is
retained, accessed by way of clamshell doors in the
nose and two large side doors. With the latter open
the cargo deck is surprisingly light and airy. Another
change is the boarding arrangement. The original
Type R assumes passengers come aboard by way of
the launch, or from a starport gantry leading directly
into the upper deck. In this variant boarding is by way
of hatches located just aft of the side cargo doors,
or through the cargo doors themselves. An elevator/
stairway leads up to the main deck through where two
of the cabins used to be.

# T HE R2A4 PROTOTYPE

Other variants of the Type R retain jump-1 capability
but add fuel tankage to permit two jumps. This may be
dedicated fuel or a fuel tank/cargo area which can be
used for one or the other at need. Some have been
converted to liners with additional cabins and recreation
spaces in the cargo area, whilst others have been
made into low-end passenger or mercenary transports
with blocks of less salubrious accommodation. Another
possibility is the addition of working areas and suites
for VIPs, creating a sort of low-cost dual-purpose yacht
or corporate trade scout. In that role the Type R variant
will carry samples rather than shipping cargo for direct
profit, attempting to secure contracts for goods over the
longer term which will then be delivered by more
cost-efficient vessels.

The upper deck has also been extensively remodelled.
This variant is not intended to carry passengers for
profit but might take officials along on a cruise to
demonstrate the vessel’s capabilities. Gone are the
twin rows of cabins, in favour of accommodation
for crew and guests as well as chambers intended
to make a good impression on visitors. This is not
a commercially viable ship in the usual sense; it is
a vessel designed to facilitate the making of deals
bringing in large amounts of money.

The Type R2A4 has 74 tons of unallocated space, of
which 20 tons are located in the dorsal bulge where
the launch used to be. Most of the remainder is on the
former cargo deck and can be left as cargo space if the
crew desire. The cargo hold is two decks high on the
standard Type R but variants like the R2A4 typically
install a middle deck for systems and accommodation.
Cargo areas remain two decks high to allow for
awkwardly shaped items to be stowed.

The prototype has a much more capable computer
system than production models are likely to have. It uses
a core/70 whereas the standard model would probably
have a computer/20. This adds MCr75 to the theoretical
price tag of the ship and was installed primarily to allow
virtual crew packages to run alongside more common
software. This vessel is a technology demonstrator and
was never intended to be able to pay for itself directly.
Whether any prospective client would want the auto-crew system is an open question but it does give the
operators some additional options.

**UPPER DECK

MIDDLE DECK


DORSAL BUMP**

###### UPPER DECK

The forward part of the upper deck is given over to
command spaces, which are protected by heavy
bulkheads. These are more about security against
internal threats than defending against other starships.
The forward command area contains the bridge, an
armoury and a small amount of common space set up
as a comfortable working area for additional crew.

Aft of the command chamber is the business centre of
the ship. A configurable common area and presentation
chamber are set up to keep guests entertained and
comfortable whilst they learn all about how great this
variant is. There is a well-stocked wine and spirits
cabinet containing a variety of upmarket brands,
although how long it remains well-stocked is an open
question. This area can also be used for dining, with
meals prepared in the adjoining galley.

Further aft is the crew accommodation block. It is
currently set up with two high staterooms and six
standard ones, plus a medical bay and some common
space. The former boarding area is now used for
storage for the most part, with access to the dorsal
bulge on vessels requiring it. The bulge contains 20
tons of the ship’s unallocated space.

###### MID AND LOWER DECK

The former cargo deck is two levels high, although a
mid-deck can be installed to support any additional cabins
or systems which have been added. The forwardmost
section of the deck is a secure cargo area, surrounded
by armoured bulkheads, with a capacity of 20 tons. This
is not part of the unallocated tonnage, although this area
could be used to install additional systems.

Aft of the secure cargo area is most of the unallocated
tonnage. If this area is not repurposed it can hold about
50 tons of cargo in addition to any in the secure area.
Personnel entry to the ship is by way of hatchways
located slightly aft of the big side cargo doors. An
enclosed elevator/stairwell on each side of the hull gives
access to the upper deck. Another hatch, normally kept
secured, leads to a tunnel running aft through the fuel
tanks to engineering. The tunnel is lined with lockers
for various spares and components. Two of the lockers
are dummies, each giving access to a concealed
compartment. Careful analysis of the ship’s fuel needs
compared to its apparent capacity might reveal there
was some discrepancy but modifications are always a
little inefficient, so loss of 5% of hull capacity as dead
space might go unremarked.

Right aft is the greatly enlarged drive and power
chamber, which also contains a small workshop.
This area is normally off-limits to passengers and
is surrounded by heavy security bulkheads. If the
concealed compartments and secure area are used
in conjunction with the remaining cargo hold, the
vessel has a nominal capacity of 114 tons. However,
since the cargo area is subdivided it may not be
possible to pack this efficiently. Capacity might be
further reduced by additional component blocks
added at the Travellers’ request.

###### DORSAL BULGE MODIFICATIONS

The dorsal bulge is designed to accept a custom
20-ton ‘systems block’ which can contain a variety of
equipment and accommodation. These blocks can be
added to any existing subsidised merchant, although
this costs 20% more than outfitting one at the time of
its rebuild. If no systems are installed in the bulge it
remains as a 20-ton open space which could be used
for stowage but which is very awkward as a cargo area.

MISSILE BATTERY


The missile battery modification uses two of the vessel’s
four hardpoints to add a formidable arsenal of missiles
to the ship’s capabilities. Two barbettes are fitted, each
with a missile magazine, with a small command chamber
between them. If other turrets are shipped these can be
controlled from the gunnery room.

ACCOMMODATION SUITE


The accommodation suite might be used to turn the
ship into a low-cost yacht or to carry high-paying
passengers who feel they are too good for the ship’s
standard accommodation. The accommodation suite
consists of a luxury cabin and a standard one – for
guests and underlings – a private lounge/dining area
and a secure stowage section equivalent to a rather
more luxurious armoury.

SECURE TRANSPORTATION UNIT


The Travellers are unlikely to choose this option
but some users might find it desirable to be able to
transport prisoners. This variant is on offer to the
Imperial Navy and the Ministry of Justice, and has
already found some potential users among local
governments. There are two cell groups, each capable
of holding six prisoners in modest discomfort, plus a
small entry and exercise area. A secure storage area
allows prisoners’ personal effects and ‘compliance
assistance equipment’ to be stowed.

The whole block is surrounded by a heavy bulkhead
with additional security features on the access points
and a remote-controlled point defence turret housing
a sandcaster and beam laser is fitted atop the bulge
to discourage unwanted visitors. The turret cannot be
accessed from inside the bulge.

**INTERNAL ACCOMMODATION UNIT**
Users wishing to increase the vessel’s passenger
capacity can replace 40 tons of internal cargo space
with additional cabins. These are built two decks high
between the lift/stairwell units and take up most of the
available cargo space. Access to what little cargo space
remains is by way of small hatches in the sides of the
ship; the large side cargo doors are removed as they are
partially blocked by the new accommodation area.

Essentially this modification converts the vessel into a
liner of sorts and is often accompanied by the luxury
suite in the dorsal bulge and a conversion of the
forward secure cargo bay. The accommodation block
is on two levels; the high staterooms and main lounge
are on the top floor, with the standard staterooms and
a tiny common area on the lower one. The whole block
is surrounded by a solid bulkhead, more for structural
than defensive reasons.

VEHICLE GARAGE


This modification converts the forward secure cargo
area into a small vehicle garage with a maintenance
area. Standard configuration allows for two ground
cars and two air/rafts, all of which are carried in
secure cradles when not in use. If the Travellers
choose this option they will be provided with 14
shipping tons of vehicles which can be a mix of G/
bikes, grav floaters, air/rafts and ground cars. ATVs
and military vehicles are not available.

HOSPITALITY SUITE


Often paired with an additional accommodation unit,
the hospitality suite turns the forward secure cargo area
into a recreation and dining area. It has a dedicated
galley and is fitted out to a luxurious standard, but the
main feature is the glazed forward dome. Essentially
the front of the ship is turned into an observatory,
whose armoured ceramic panels can be turned
opaque or used as a projection area for holographic
presentations... or even a backdrop for live-action/
holographic plays.

Travellers who make good use of this modification
should be permitted a positive DM on attempts to
impress or influence guests. This will typically be DM+
or +2 but may be higher if the Travellers do a lot of
preparation or really put some effort in. It will still not be
possible to instantly sell hundreds of ships to a client
but this stage of the process will be facilitated.

##### The R2A4 Prototype

The R2A4 prototype has an advanced ‘Autocrew’
capability, theoretically allowing it to operate under
remote control or even to carry out missions with no
crew aboard. Interstellar law requires that any starship
or space vessel have a designated master, which
raises questions as to whether a ‘drone’ starship would
be viable. There are also reportedly problems with
jump operations without a live astrogator aboard the
ship. RVSC has no interest whatsoever in researching
these matters using expensive ship prototypes – or at
all for that matter – so the R2A4 is not programmed to
conduct jump operations automatically. It can carry out
missions within a star system, which is probably legal
providing the ship’s designated master is also present
in the system to take responsibility for its actions.

The Autocrew can carry out most other functions,
although physical tasks that cannot be performed by
the ship’s cleaning robots are impossible. The auto-steward function can, for example, regulate the oven
temperature to cook a pie perfectly but someone will
have to combine the ingredients and place the dish
in the oven. The Travellers may worry about their
vessel turning into some kind of robotic death-trap but
this is not possible. The Autocrew consists of several
distinct functions, none of which have more than limited
decision-making capability. These are not artificial
intelligences and have no free will; they are expert
systems intended to help the crew.

Normally the Autocrew can be given instructions by
anyone designated as a crewmember, with preference
given to those with responsibility for the relevant
area. Thus when the pilot gives orders to the auto-manoeuvring system these will over-rule whatever
the steward has told it to do. There are exceptions to
this; the three RVSC employees aboard can over-rule
anything the Travellers have ordered the system to do
and Joachim can trigger the emergency lockdown no
matter what anyone else has to say about it.

AUTOBRIDGE


The AutoBridge function is more than an automatic pilot.
It can plot normal-space courses and fly the ship, and is
also capable of handling communications and sensors
tasks. Under normal conditions the AutoBridge package

# A UTOCREW

maintains a sensor watch and will carry out course
optimisation manoeuvres whenever needed. It will also
attempt to avoid collisions, notifying the crew of hazards
before it does so. The package has an effective skill
level of 1 when carrying out all of these functions.

AutoBridge can, in theory, take the ship from one
landing pad to another on the other side of the star
system with nothing more than verbal commands from
someone lounging in a hot tub in the dorsal bulge. It
is not the best of pilots, however, and will err on the
side of caution unless explicitly instructed to take a
more aggressive approach. This will not show the ship
off very well, so Travellers are expected to handle
demonstrations of piloting. On the other hand, the
ability to constantly optimise a course requires nothing
more than endless number-crunching and will quietly
impress those who understand the value of shaving a
few minutes off an interplanetary transit.

AUTOENGINEER


The AutoEngineer function runs the drives and power
systems, and is capable of making fine corrections
on a constant basis. This in theory saves a little fuel
by optimising power output and drive thrust but in
practice the difference is very small. There is also an
auto-diagnostic feature which should be very useful in
fault-finding. However, it has serious faults that have so
far escaped the notice of the programming team. The
system has never been run continuously for more than a
few days, which has prevented the flaw from appearing.

When the AutoEngineer system has been running
for more than a couple of weeks, small mathematical
errors start to corrupt its function. These will go
unnoticed at first as the system’s self-diagnostics
correct for them. After this time, there is an increasing
chance of a malfunction or a false alarm regarding one
of the ship’s systems. This might be anything from a
desk lamp to the jump drive. Malfunctions should be
small and worrying or irritating rather than dangerous
at first, causing the Travellers to start looking for
problems. The false alarms will then drive them crazy
by directing them to systems that are working perfectly
well but register as being the source of the problem.

After a bit of running around fixing non-existent
problems and chasing real ones in the wrong place,
the Travellers may tire of the AutoEngineer package.
It is unlikely to cause life-threatening problems but
will become a constant irritant. However, turning it off
removes part of the whole-ship automation system
and may cause other packages to begin behaving
erratically. Sufficient reprogramming to fix the problem
is beyond the resources of this mission.

When AutoEngineer is working correctly – which is
most of the time – if can carry out all life support,
power and drive functions with an effective skill level
of 1. As with other systems, it needs someone with
hands to do physical work – the AutoEngineer can
regulate the water flow to a shower system but cannot
hand the soap to a user.

**AUTOGUNNER**
The AutoGunner package can operate any or all of the
ship’s weapons with an effective DM+1. It is an efficient
system but suffers from a form of over-helpfulness that
could be a liability in a weapons control package. One of
AutoGunner’s foibles is its habit of offering an auto-lock
on almost any target in range. This may be disconcerting
as a customs vessel approaches and the gunnery
system suddenly asks ‘lock weapons on target?’ over the
shipboard intercom. Playing around with the interface
will enable the Travellers to eliminate this trait, more or
less. Other than being over-eager to the point where it
can seem positively bloodthirsty, AutoGunner works well
enough and can be trusted to decide which targets are
most urgent, prioritising point defence and protection of
the ship over more distant threats.

**AUTOPURSER**
The AutoPurser part of the package is essentially a
financial expert system, which constantly predicts
market conditions and trends in nearby systems as well
as managing the vessel’s internal finances. AutoPurser
pays the Travellers every month, exactly on time, and
handles docking fees and the like automatically unless
someone really wants to intervene. In this role it is
entirely competent – its effective skill level of Admin 1 is
sufficient for routine tasks never to go wrong.

When acting as a broker or financial planner,
AutoPurser has an effective skill level of 1. However,
its mode of operation can be modified. The default
setting is extremely cautious, prioritising the greatest
chance of making some profit – even a tiny one – over
calculated risks. This is not a good way to actually
make money out of interstellar commerce and the

Travellers may decide the system should be a bit less
risk-averse. That can raise different problems, since
at its most extreme AutoPurser can be a reckless
gambler who dreams of the vast payoff if the huge
risk turns out to have been worth it. The Travellers
will have to experiment with the settings to find a level
they are happy with, or simply ignore its advice.

USING AUTOCREW


The Autocrew packages can be used to allow a
band of Travellers lacking critical skills to carry out
the mission, or add a little personality to the ship.
The foibles of AutoGunner and AutoPurser might
cause some minor problems and can also be used to
distract the Travellers from the gradual breakdown of
AutoEngineer. Nothing goes wrong with AutoEngineer
for the first five weeks of the mission, after which there
is a chance of cascading faults. The Referee should roll
2D on the AutoEngineer Faults table at the beginning
of mission week 6 and each week thereafter. The roll
begins with no DM but certain events will cause the
failure DM to increase. The Referee should keep track
of this and apply it to all rolls thereafter.

What is happening is that small mathematical and
command errors in AutoEngineer begin to affect other
systems that interact with the ship’s power and life
support equipment. AutoEngineer eventually corrupts
their operations to the point where the ship is very
difficult to operate. Shutting AutoEngineer off will
permit the problems in other systems to be diagnosed
and cleared out – taking 2D hours per attempt, and
requiring an Average (8+) Electronics (computers)
check. It would be unwise to allow a corrupted system
to do this automatically.

AutoEngineer cannot be cleared this way. Turning it
off and on again will not resolve anything but does
create the chance of more problems. Make a new 2D
roll to determine the level of issues when the system
is turned back on. Travellers may be able to mitigate
the problem by bug-hunting. Each session of 1Dx1D
hours allows a Difficult (10+) Electronics (computers)
check to be made. The failure DM is reduced by the
Effect of the check.

If AutoEngineer is simply switched off, it stops
corrupting the other systems but they are all designed
to interface with one another. As a result, there will be
minor glitches and false alarms on a regular basis, and
every time an automated check is made there is a one
in six chance it is subject to an effective DM-1 instead
of the usual DM+1.

RHYLANOR SUBSECTOR



Spinward Marches

H



The Rhylanor subsector contains 32 star systems
of which 25 are located on one of the arms of the
Spinward Main. The subsector is economically powerful
and also vital as an easy route for commerce across
the coreward end of the Spinward Marches. The
majority of this activity is in the coreward end of the
subsector, with a jump-2 transit to the rimward end
possible by way of Jae Tellona.

The astrographical layout of Rhylanor has significant
military and political implications as well as the more
obvious economic ones. Not surprisingly, the subsector
and its name-world were primary targets for the
Zhodani during the four Frontier Wars. There are seven
naval bases in the subsector, including the primary
sector fleet installation at Macene. Although this has
not been granted Depot status it approaches the
capabilities of one and is likely to be commissioned as
a Depot in the next couple of decades.

Security for the subsector is provided by the 212th Fleet,
which is typical for its type. The fleet has a light cruiser
as its flagship and a number of modern fleet destroyers
but relies mainly on patrol and escort vessels as well

as older destroyers. In wartime it might be reinforced
with heavy units from the sector fleet but it is generally
preferable to keep these concentrated under central
command. The in-system defences of major worlds and
naval bases contribute greatly to the security of these
systems, freeing the subsector fleet to maintain an
increased presence in the less well-travelled systems.
As a result the Rhylanor-Coreward segment of the
Spinward Main is one of the safest trade arteries in the
region despite its proximity to the border.

Rhylanor is famous as a battleground but also as the
birthplace of Emperor Olav I. After his victory over
the Outworld Coalition in the First Frontier War, Olav
hault-Plankwell took his fleet to Capital and declared
himself Emperor – thereby ushering in the Civil War.
This creates a rather controversial figure – Admiral
Plankwell is definitely a hero up to the end of the First
Frontier War. Thereafter he is seen by many as a
righteous figure, offended at the lack of central support
for the people of the Marches. Others, particularly those
from sectors ravaged by the Civil War, see him as a
power-hungry megalomaniac who caused immense
destruction and suffering.

**JOURNEY OF THE CREW**

##### Rhylanor subsector

All but six of the 27 star systems in Lanth lie on the
Spinward Main or can be reached from it by a jump-2 capable ship. The Jenghe system provides jump-1
access coreward into the Regina subsector, whilst the
neighbouring naval base at Extolay is tasked with trans-

# L ANTH SUBSECTOR

border security. Relatively little traffic continues spinward
along the main, although trade with Arden has picked up
in recent years. Most shipping heads coreward, usually
terminating at Efate from where a jump-2 network
facilitates trade out to the border and beyond.

LANTH SUBSECTOR



spinward Marches

G



27



The Lanth segment of the Spinward Main is well-travelled and generally secure, but that does not
always translate to it being safe. The majority of
the subsector is very sparse, known colloquially as
the Abyss Rift. This region has a bad reputation for
misjumps and navigational problems, and whilst the
situation is exaggerated by wild spacers’ tales the
statistics do show a higher incidence of misjump in the
region surrounding the rift.

Lanth is politically complex, in that its capital is located
in the rimward-spinward corner and requires a jump-4 transit to reach. Thus Lanth itself receives little
commercial traffic other than large corporate freighters
capable of long jumps. Information and instruction
turnaround is at least four weeks for any world on
the Spinward Main. This is not usually a problem as
regional offices and local officials can take care of
routine matters, but does create some tension since
help can more quickly be obtained from Regina or
Rhylanor than Lanth.

The worlds of Lanth and D’Ganzio, both of which
have naval bases, are generally thought of as
bastions against Sword Worlds expansion. This is not
necessarily military; economic and cultural influences
are also considered a threat. A programme of local
assistance and trade on generous terms is in place,
with a flotilla of jump-2 freighters routinely making the

run into Confederation space. It is widely thought that
the project is a cover for intelligence gathering and
covert operations, which is probably true.

The subsector is at present defended by the 23rd
Provisional Fleet, a placeholder designation which has
never been superseded. The 23rd Provisional Fleet has
its headquarters at Ivendo and possesses a higher
proportion of low-jump, small vessels such as patrol
corvettes than is usual for such force, although it also
boasts a contingent of high-jump ‘rift cruisers’. It is
unusual for a subsector fleet to have more than one or
at most two cruiser-sized units and these are almost
always flagships. In this case, the need to operate in
the Abyss Rift has made such vessels a necessity.

Lanth and D’Ganzio are ‘fortress worlds’, intended
to hold out for long periods in the event of attack. In
addition to their local forces and the non-jump-capable
defences for the naval bases, both have a contingent of
light and heavy cruisers on deployment from the sector
fleet. These are officially there for ‘border security and
assistance’ work but in wartime are likely to be tasked
with chasing down Sword Worlds raiders or conducting
heavy reconnaissance of the region between Lanth and
the Sword Worlds Confederation. In the meantime, they
show the flag and remind the nearby world populations
that the Imperial Navy’s ships are far more advanced
than those of the Sword Worlds.

VILIS SUBSECTOR


Spinward Marches
F



The Vilis subsector lies at the spinward edge of the Third
Imperium. 16 of its 26 star systems are Imperial members,
although most are of relatively low value. The spinward-rimward corner of the subsector borders the Sword
Worlds Confederation, whilst the spinward-coreward
edge contains part of the demilitarised zone created after
the Third Frontier War. This region is influenced by the
independent world of Arden, which styles itself the leader
of a semi-fictional ‘Federation of Arden’.

Strategically and economically, the subsector is not of
any great importance. It is considered to be something
of a buffer zone and receives relatively little defensive
investment – which coupled with astrographical
isolation leads to lower levels of commercial and
industrial investment as well. Vilis is considered by
most strategic planners to be a forward battleground
or if necessary a concession that could be given
away at the negotiating table in return for keeping
something more important.

The flaw in this strategy is that if enough of the Vilis
buffer zone is given away, or if Lanth falls to a Sword
Worlds advance, hostile ships can be based that much
closer to the Spinward Main. ‘Fortress Vilis’ proponents
warn that not caring enough about the subsector could
mean losing the vital trade artery and everything it
connects to. ‘Surrender Vilis and we give away Regina’
is a common cry when budgets are under discussion.

Vilis currently does not have a formally designated
subsector fleet. This situation is unusual and resulted
from the complex treaty agreements made after the end
of the Third Frontier War. Security forces are assigned

but they have never been allocated Numbered Fleet
status. Instead, there are two small area commands
based at Frenzie and Mirriam, whilst the naval base
at Denotam is intended to house forward-deployed
elements of the sector fleet. It is well protected by in-system craft but usually plays host only to a handful
of destroyers and light cruisers which show the flag in
the demilitarised zone. In wartime the base would be
used to stage movements of heavy fleet elements out
to spinward against the Zhodani or spinward-rimward
against the Sword Worlds.

Naval Security Force Frenzie patrols the rimward-spinward corner of the subsector and makes forays out
into the Querion subsector. Most of its vessel allocation
is a mix of patrol corvettes and similar low-capability
ships and refitted obsolescent destroyers. This is wholly
inadequate to resist an invasion but suffices to keep the
peace. Naval Security Force Mirriam is even weaker,
being tasked mainly with patrolling four near-worthless
systems. However, the bases are well defended and
would serve as a breakwater for an invading force, or
as a staging point for more capable vessels moved up
to operate in the enemy’s rear.

For many years there have been plans to rationalise
the security forces of the sector and either move some
of the numbered fleets or redesignate them. However,
all such plans have had to struggle against the tide of
cross-cutting agendas and more pressing requirements
for vessels elsewhere. The usual response is that ‘the
sector fleet is a courier jump away’, which is all very
well unless the sector fleet is similarly stretched too thin
and dispersed by internal-political requirements.

##### Rhylanor subsector

A little preparation is required to set up Whispers on the
Abyss. This can be worked into an ongoing campaign
at some suitable point or dealt with outside the game
environment. It is best if each Traveller goes through
this process privately. If they then want to reveal their
Agenda or affiliations that is up to them. If they want
to mislead others or pretend ignorance of the situation
they can of course do so.

What the Travellers have in common is that somehow
they became aware of an interesting opportunity. A
small starship company was offering good money and
the chance of a big bonus to take part in a ‘showcase
cruise’ aboard their new starship variant. Crewmembers
and business people were obviously needed but others
might play a useful part. A highly decorated naval
officer might add gravitas to the vessel, whilst a famous
actor or rock star would attract media attention.

The deal, in general terms, was simple enough. Each
Traveller would receive transportation to Rhylanor
Highport, either by liner or by way of vouchers to cover
their own ship’s expenses. At that point they would
take possession of the ship and receive Cr100000 as a
hiring bonus. After a couple of days to become familiar
with the ship they would set out on a cruise along the
Spinward Main, terminating at Arden. The goal is to sell
starships. Not just one or two but to generate the sort of
orders that will keep a yard busy for years!

The Travellers’ role is to impress potential clients at
each port of call. In most cases interest has been
already generated by way of datanet advertising or
paying local representatives to set up meetings. These
will be important people, the sort who can authorise
multi-Megacredit purchases. The Travellers will show
off the ship to them, both directly and by demonstrating
excellence in routine operations. Pay will be Cr10000
per month for each member of the mission, with a
bonus at the end and the possibility of percentage
points on deals the Travellers facilitate.

The money is good, with the potential of a bigger
payoff at some point in the future when deals go
through and ships are delivered. There are other
advantages as well. The Travellers are about to make
some important contacts. The sort of people who

# S ETTING UP THE CAMPAIGN

buy multiple starships are worth knowing. Whether
the Travellers simply want the prospect of future
employment or they have bigger ambitions, this
mission could open doors for them. A Traveller with
political ambitions might find a niche with one of the
world governments they visit or develop a rapport
that leads to support later. Someone with a shadier
background might find it useful to make friends among
a world government that does not have an extradition
treaty with the Imperium. Smart Travellers can get a
lot more out of this mission than just a paycheque.

Or is there more to it than that? The Referee needs
to determine with each Traveller if they have one or
more Agendas (see page 6). Travellers do not need
to specify an Agenda if they do not wish to and may
change theirs as a result of experience. However,
an Agenda gives an indication of what the Traveller
wants out of the mission and will help the Referee
provide interesting experiences. In some cases
Agendas may be due to personal goals but there
is also a possibility a Traveller may be working for
some outside agency.

Travellers should be presented with the five general
motivations – Employee, Expert, Notable, Fake and
Plant and asked if any of them apply. The Employee,
Expert and Notable Agendas are straightforward and
self-explanatory. Fake and Plant might require some
additional explanation. Travellers who are Fakes need
to decide why they are presenting a false identity or
set of competences. This might be a personal reason,
like someone wanting to become a media celebrity and
trying to ‘fake it until you make it’. If so, the Referee is
provided with some possible side adventure leads.

If a Traveller is a Plant then who they work for may
be important. The Referee can assume the Traveller
was approached or volunteered to carry out some
undercover work, but that does not mean they
necessarily know who is the end client. A Traveller
might think they are attempting to learn corporate
secrets or sabotage the mission on behalf of another
shipping corporation when in fact an Imperial noble is
the end client and wants the information to speculate
on the stock exchanges.

A Plant who is working for an outside agency may be
able to obtain support or information along the way.
Travellers may also have the opportunity to effectively
become a Plant as their mission evolves. Ultimately they
will make their own choices but a client who has placed
the Travellers where they can fulfil a role might not be
pleased if they choose not to carry out their task. Be that
as it may, the possible clients a Plant might be working
for could have implications beyond this campaign.

###### FINGERS IN THE PIE

The Travellers’ Agendas, if they have any, may
connect them to some of those who are interested in
the mission. There are several forces at work here,
each of which has its own goals. These are not all
mutually contradictory.

**RVSC**
RVSC, obviously, wants the mission to go ahead
as planned and hopes to receive orders for starship
conversions. Reports on market conditions and
possible advantages to be gained will be very welcome.
The company will not acknowledge the existence
of the automated intelligence package aboard the
prototype, for the very good reason they do not know
about it. Almost everyone involved thinks it is part of the
Autocrew system. A few technicians were incentivised
not to ask too many questions when fitting it, partly by
being given a rush job and partly by being paid a fat
bonus to just get it done and not talk about it. They
think they were just covering someone’s mistake;
perhaps a manager who messed up the schedule.

In fact, the intelligence package was provided to
a regional manager named Davis Levoreen, who
accepted a large off-the-books payment to get it placed
aboard the prototype. He thinks the money (and the
package) came from Imperial Naval Intelligence. He
is corrupt and greedy but not a willing traitor to the
Imperium. What he does not know is that the package
was ‘redirected’ by personnel working for Sir Armanda
Khernadi – who is very much a traitor. She was
suborned by the Zhodani intelligence community a few
years ago and has been passing minor secrets along
ever since. Getting the package and its data into the
hands of the Zhodani will be her big proof of loyalty and
result in a position of great power when – inevitably and
soon, she believes – the Zhodani Consulate overruns
everything as far as the Corridor sector.

One or more Travellers may become associated with
this operation if they have a suitable Agenda. In all
likelihood they will remain ignorant of the real situation
until late in the campaign but they may be connected
to Davis Levoreen in other ways. He is always looking
for ways to make more money, which includes assisting
young executives in climbing the corporate ladder in
the hope of placing people who owe him a favour in the
right jobs. He will also protect those who screw up or
are not competent in their position in return for favours
and simple bribery is a useful tool as well. Essentially,
any Travellers who are involved in shady dealings
within RVSC are likely to be connected to Levoreen.

IMPERIAL NAVAL INTELLIGENCE


The INI knows that one of its experimental intelligence
gathering and analysis packages is missing but they
have no idea it is aboard the R2A4 prototype. A
Traveller connected with naval intelligence will probably
have a different brief. The INI keeps a close watch on
the borders at all times and is concerned about recent
developments. War scares are not uncommon and it
is a standard tactic to move ships around in a way that
elevates concern then withdraw them. That way a real
build-up might be mistaken for just another exercise
or show of strength. All the same, INI is concerned
about recent activities on the part of Zhodani ships and
intelligence operatives.

Reports from within the Consulate suggest a slightly
elevated rate of warship movements, combined with
a drop in detected intrusions and threatening actions
along the border. This suggests that either the Zhodani
have suddenly become much better at sneaking
ships into Imperial space or they are building fewer
reconnaissance cruisers. That might be seen as a good
thing but it may indicate they want to lower tensions
and there are both good and bad reasons why that
might happen. The intelligence services want more
information, particularly about Zhodani diplomatic and
intelligence operations along the spinward frontier. Any
attempts to court Arden would be of great interest given
its status as a supposedly neutral world where Imperial
and Zhodani agencies can do business.

A Traveller connected with the INI will have
Commander Alix Jehk as their ultimate point of contact.
Commander Jehk is a coordinator of operatives
reporting to regional command at Rhylanor. The
Traveller will be instructed to watch for signs that the
Zhodani Consulate is increasing its influence over
Arden and its associated worlds.

##### Setting up the Campaign



###### GENERAL PRODUCTS

The megacorporation General Products is interested
in RVSC and its activities. General would prefer the
mission not go very well, since it is competing for the
same market share with its new design of armed naval
auxiliary/transport. Physical sabotage is not a preferred
option but the mission can be undermined in other
ways. Small ‘mistakes’ when demonstrating the ship or
‘gaffes’ when dealing with local dignitaries may reduce
the chances of a successful negotiation.

Passing information to the local representatives of
General Products might lead to opportunities to be
exploited once the mission has moved on, and will be a
goal for any General Products agents planted aboard.
General also wants to know about the ship, ideally
schematics and detailed system blueprints. These will
have to be stolen from the ship’s computer. The details
of any deals struck will also be useful; perhaps they
can be derailed by a better offer.

A Traveller who becomes involved with General
Products will be advised about a covert datanet
channel which can be used to upload information for
the local representative or the next mobile operative
to pick up. Direct requests for assistance may or
may not produce a response depending on how long
the Travellers are in port and what level of presence
General Products has.

OTHER PATRONS


A variety of other people have an interest either in the
region or in starship procurement. The Travellers might
become involved with almost any of them, although
for the most part they will simply want information on
local conditions and deals in progress. The Travellers
may think they are gathering harmless information for
someone wanting to use it in a business context when
in fact they are feeding data to a terrorist group or an
independence movement funded by a foreign power.

One potential contact uses the code-name Silent
Observer and is known to pay well for information on
a variety of subjects. Silent Observer seems to be an
infobroker; someone who will find out whatever the
client needs to know in return for a large fee. This
is partially true, but the infobrokerage is a cover for
intelligence gathering on the part of the Ine Givar,
an organisation dedicated to the overthrow of the
Imperium. It has agents on many worlds, gathering
intelligence and feeding it to their planning committees.
Travellers associated with Silent Observer will be given
discreet upload channels and paid by credit transfer to
a disposable account. They will not deal directly with
Silent Observer, which they may correctly assume is an
organisation rather than an individual.

##### Setting up the Campaign

Rhylanor is one of three worlds comprising the
Rhylanor Cluster, just off the Spinward Main. Most
traffic in the subsector goes along one or the other
arms of that main, with jump-2 ships linking Rhylanor
to major trade routes by way of Jae Tellona or
Porozlo. Rhylanor’s slight disconnection from the
trade arteries is not a problem for governmental
communications as the world is well served by
the x-boat network, but relatively few small private
ships come through its port. There is, however, no
shortage of shipping in the form of large corporate
freighters and jump-2 commercial vessels operated
by respectable intermediate shipping lines. It is almost
as if Rhylanor thinks itself a bit too good to be hosting
beat-up old free traders.

Rhylanor is the innermost planet of its solar system,
with a very thin atmosphere. Whilst this does have
an oxygen-nitrogen mix it is far too thin to support
humans or advanced life of any kind. Surface gravity
is rather light, at 0.5G. There is sufficient surface
water to support life, but it is very primitive. Much of
the surface outside the inhabited cities is covered in
multi-cellular growth similar to lichen. There are no
native animals and imported species cannot survive
outside the controlled climates of the arcologies.

The thin atmosphere means Rhylanor receives
considerable amounts of stellar radiation and
provides little protection from meteorites. Numerous
impact craters have been identified all over the
surface, with clusters in some areas. The largest
crater is close to the equator and houses a colony
of [[Llellewyloly]], a rather strange sentient species
normally referred to as Dandelions due to their
appearance. Some of the craters have become
micro-ecosystems which interest scientists, but since
all that has ever been discovered is new kinds of
lichen their findings rarely cause much of a stir.

The lichen-covered surface is largely irrelevant to the
population of Rhylanor, most of whom never venture
outside their cities. These are linked by regular grav
vehicle services which operate out of combination
space/gravports at each major population centre. It has
been observed that on worlds such as this most of the

populace tend to forget that there is an outside surface
at all, other than when some event reminds them.
Most recently this was an ill-fated expedition to climb
Mount Whatsit, otherwise known as Zhitar. Flying to
the top of a mountain such as Whatsit in a grav vehicle
is unremarkable as an achievement but climbing in
a pressure suit is a whole other level of challenge.
By all accounts the team that made the attempt were
experienced and highly competent, and their tragic
failure has led to restrictions being placed on already
inaccessible regions.

###### SOCIETY ON RHYLANOR

The people of Rhylanor have much to be proud of
and they know it; Rhylanor is the birthplace of Olav
hault-Plankwell, victor of the First Frontier War and
instigator of the Imperial Civil War. Whilst Plankwell
is a controversial figure, Arbellatra Khatami Alkhalikoi
is almost universally revered. After victory in the
Second Frontier War she brought an end to the
Imperial Civil War and established herself as regent.
In time she was chosen as Emperor, the first of the
current ruling dynasty.



Rhylanor is ruled by a hereditary oligarchy made up
of Imperial noble families. Some of these families
claim descent from various historical figures, with
varying degrees of separation, although some
connections are rather tenuous, often by way of
someone assumed to be a lover or a distant relative
of some member of the Plankwell or Alkhalikoi
families. Claims that would be dismissed as over-stretched elsewhere are readily accepted by
members of the social elite and those who wish to
join it. There is a game to be played in the upper
echelons of Rhylanor’s society and those who do not
play along stand no chance of being accepted.

The population, numbering around eight billion,
dwell in large arcologies surrounded by enclosed
agricultural lands. These support crops and livestock
originating on a great many worlds, although
Rhylanor also imports a great deal of food. Quality of
life is high and the populace are generally content.
Indeed, many would describe them as rather smug.
Well-educated and with a strong sense of who they
are, the people of Rhylanor are used to controlling
processes carried out by robots and machines rather
than actually doing the work, and tend to look down
on those who have less than they do.

###### THE STARPORT

Normally a world has one officially designated
starport and may have multiple spaceports. Rhylanor,
naturally, is an exception. The main port is generally
known as Rhylanor Highport and consists of a
cluster of multiple controlled-environment segments
around a main structure. Many of these segments
are permanently set up to provide for the needs of
species requiring a different atmosphere composition
or pressure, an aquatic environment or whatever
else they may need. This part of the installation is
unofficially referred to as the ‘alien quarter’ although
the term is discouraged and port employees can be
disciplined for using it.

Specialist shuttles are available to take visitors from
the landing bays to an area set up for their comfort
without moving through the main parts of the station.
Whilst convenient this does create segregation and
limits interactions, so the station authorities have
provided numerous meeting areas that can be set
up to allow people to interact face to face through
a clear screen of starship-grade material or to don
suitable protective equipment and sit down across a
real negotiating table.

Other parts of the station are dedicated to agriculture
and industry, with a modest system defence presence.
This does host a few Imperial Navy vessels but major
units are housed at the naval base elsewhere in the
system. The highport was constructed to serve as a
defensive installation at need, mounting huge batteries
of missiles and torpedoes along with a defensive laser
armament and several large particle accelerator bays.
More commonly, fighters and system defence boats
operate from the station, mainly undertaking security
and customs work.

The other orbital port is also officially named
Rhylanor Highport. When it was replaced it should
have been downgraded to a spaceport but for
some reason it was not. Known locally as ‘The Old
Station’ this installation is technically part of the main
port, just a detached one, and continues to serve
in-system and interstellar traffic. The Old Station
is constructed as a double torus, with one wheel
serving as a business and habitation centre and the
other containing agricultural production areas as well
as some minor industrial facilities.

The downport is rather less impressive. It might be
considered the ‘first among equals’ on a world with
multiple ports serving its primary cities. Although
officially part of the designated starport, Rhylanor
Down receives only a little more traffic than the city-spaceports. Its startown is rather shabby, partly due
to a lack of investment and partly because the local
population consider the downport to be the province
of those who are insufficiently important to establish
themselves on the highports.

###### NAVAL BASE AND SHIPYARDS

Rhylanor naval base is the headquarters for the
subsector fleet and also hosts a major naval academy.
Elements of the sector fleet do visit and the facility is
set up to host a major capital ship contingent at need.
However, for the most part the base is dedicated to
system defence and support of patrol operations in
local systems. Much of this activity is to rimward-trailing
as systems in other directions either fall under the
jurisdiction of the Lanth Subsector Fleet or are more
easily secured by ships based out of Risek and Nutema.

The naval base has repair facilities for several
cruiser-sized vessels and one or two capital ships,
although normally major vessels would be sent to
Macene for repair or overhaul. The Rhylanor yards
mainly undertake maintenance of subsector fleet
vessels and the occasional set of modifications on an

##### Rhylanor

existing vessel. It is widely assumed that some ships
coming out of the Rhylanor yards are prototypes or
experimental variants, or may be one-off conversions to
carry out some specific task.

The Rhylanor naval base does not construct starships,
although there are shipyards in the system which are
owned by corporations and private concerns. Much of
the work they undertake is for the navy, typically rather
humble but necessary vessels such as auxiliaries,
tankers and supply transports. Freighters and jump-2 commercial ships are also regularly constructed
or overhauled at these yards, usually for clients who
have pre-ordered a large batch. However, sometimes
deals go awry or orders are reduced in which case
spare capacity or half-built ships are offered at a
discount on the local starship construction market.
Rhylanor Highport has a vibrant ship sales and orders
sector as a result.

###### THE RHYLANOR INSTITUTE^

###### OF TECHNOLOGY

RIT is arguably the foremost university in the sector
and certainly presents itself as such. It has a broad
base of programmes in most disciplines but specialises
in hard science and technological research. A large
segment of the population have RIT qualifications from
open-learning courses, usually at a pre-degree level.
It is possible to study almost anything to bachelor’s
degree level at RIT, although other universities have
better degree and graduate programmes in the
humanities and other non-scientific fields.

Some of the research undertaken at RIT is highly
classified, with the end client or sponsor kept secret.
Usually this sponsor is the Imperium itself or one of the
megacorporations and it is entirely possible that there
are two or even more projects researching the same
subject for different clients. The university maintains a
number of research starships and installations, typically
on remote outsystem bodies in other star systems.

##### Rhylanor

The campaign opens on the world of Rhylanor, one
of the most famous in the Spinward Marches. Many
citizens of distant star systems believe that Rhylanor
is the capital of the sector, some because it is the only
place they have heard of in the region and some due to
the efforts of those who believe their homeworld really
should be the local capital.

The default opening is that the Travellers are arriving
to begin their mission for RVSC. If they have a ship of
their own it will be looked after by the company in their
absence and given annual maintenance for free. When
the mission terminates RVSC will either pay for liner
passage back to Rhylanor or deliver the Travellers’ ship
to a destination of their choice. There is a possibility
they may be permitted to keep the prototype if they
perform particularly well.

###### ARRIVING AT RHYLANOR

The Travellers will arrive at the orbital starport

- probably but not necessarily the modern one.

There, they are to be met by a representative of the
company. If the Travellers do not already know one
another they may be arriving from different systems
and might not be aboard the same ship. The Referee
might decide that some of the Travellers have been
at the port for a few days and that ships carrying the
others arrive at different times over a period of a few
hours or even days. The level of detail is very much
up to the Referee. If some Travellers are already
present they will be able to explore the highport, do
some shopping, or whatever else they feel like. The
adventure begins when they have all arrived.

The designated RVSC representative is Stannen
Vaanaii, who greets the Travellers and hosts a fairly
typical meet-and-greet. Joachim and Maninra are
present and will be introduced. The atmosphere
is intended to be relaxed, with wine and light
refreshments. Everyone is encouraged to introduce
themselves with a short statement of their background
and any notable achievements. Travellers should not
reveal their Agenda if they have one but can of course
make statements that suggest they have a particular
Agenda if it suits their purposes.

# T OF RHYLANOR

#### HE GREAT GATES

Once everyone is introduced the socialising gives
way to a briefing and allocation of tasks. A set of very
well created holographic images showcase the R2A4,
progressing from its humble origins as a broken-down old Type R subsidised merchant to its sleek
new look as a fast and elegant vessel to rival anything
the megacorporations can field. Internal and optional
features are mentioned, and the Travellers have the
opportunity to agree which they want. It can be assumed
they expressed their preferences in advance and the
conversion yard has already implemented them.

DORSAL BULGE: Missile Battery, Accommodation
Suite or Secure Accommodation Block?

MAIN CARGO AREA: Retain as cargo hold or fit
Internal Accommodation Unit (reduces cargo capacity
by 40 tons)?

FORWARD SECURE CARGO AREA: Retain as
cargo or convert to vehicle garage or hospitality suite (both reduce cargo capacity by 20 tons)?

The Travellers are reminded that this is not a
commercial cargo-hauler any more. It is a showcase,
a technology demonstrator and money is to be made
from obtaining orders for additional vessels rather than
carrying stuff from one port to another. They have the
chance to tailor the ship to whatever market sector
they intend to target. The secure cargo areas are not
a secret from the crew, although they do not appear on
publicly available schematics of the vessel. Stannen
is happy to discuss everything about the ship and the
mission. They do not, however, know about the secret
intelligence package.

Next, the Travellers will need to decide who is assigned
to which positions aboard ship. Stannen is in overall
charge of the mission but the ship will need people
assigned to certain roles. The Autocrew system can
cover most or perhaps all positions but there is a need
to identify who has primary responsibility for those tasks.
For example, the ship needs a designated chief engineer
whose commands override those of other crewmembers
in all areas of engineering responsibility. This person
should be a qualified starship engineer but if no-one with
the right skills is available a designated person can run
the relevant systems using AutoEngineer.

The vessel will need the following:

MASTER: This person takes responsibility for
commanding the ship and answers for everything
the crew (including the automated systems) do in the
course of the mission.

ASTROGATOR: This person is responsible for
navigating the ship through normal and jumpspace, and
bears specific responsibility for matters relating to the
ship’s course and position.

PILOT: This person is responsible for manoeuvres
the ship makes whether or not an automated system
is in actual control.

CHIEF ENGINEER: This person is responsible for
ensuring the drives, life support and power systems are
functioning correctly.

GUNNERY OFFICER: This person is responsible for
weapons systems and their use.

PURSER: This person is responsible for ensuring
the ship is properly supplied and that accurate
accounts are kept.

Everyone is being paid the same, so it might seem
there is no incentive to take on responsibility. However,
performance in a command role will be used to
determine how bonuses are allocated. Command
personnel ideally should have relevant skills but even
if they do not they are still responsible for everything
in their department. Most of the time that means
checking the Autocrew is doing its job properly and
giving it suitable commands. If they want, the Travellers
could actually fly the ship themselves but – as far as
is apparent at this point – the ship could carry out
the mission automatically. A single Traveller can take
responsibility for all positions if necessary. This might
be a big job but credit would not have to be shared.

###### DOWN TO KIKHIMAA CITY

The regional conversion yard for RVSC is close to
the city of Kikhimaa, an arcology with its own small
spaceport. A shuttle has been provided for the
Travellers’ use, along with a pilot and a steward to
serve refreshments on the short flight. Leaving the
orbital port, the Travellers will be struck by just how
dull Rhylanor looks from orbit. The brownish-grey
mats of lichen that cover its surface reflect little light,
creating a monotonous landscape punctuated by
mountain ranges and small seas.

There is a lot of traffic around the port but relatively little
moving planetside, making the landing approach very
simple. The only complication is a regulation against
overflying the city or heading directly towards it. Instead
the shuttle must follow a curving path such that it is
never in a situation where drive failure could cause it to
impact the arcology. This is not an unusual requirement.

The yards are an impressive sprawl on the far side of
the port from the city, with individual semi-underground
work cells covered by a retractable shield. Normally,
these are kept closed but as the Travellers approach
they will see that many are open. Some pads are
empty, others house half-dismantled ships – a mix of
free traders and subsidised merchants for the most
part but also some small craft and a patrol corvette –
and a few showcase the gleaming forms of completed
vessels. It is obvious that RVSC is putting on a show.

The shuttle lands directly at the installation rather
than the starport, neatly dropping into a work cell that
could house a dismantled 600-ton vessel. Once the
shield slides closed overhead the cell is purged with
compressed gas and a safe atmosphere is pumped in.
The process takes just a few minutes, after which the
Travellers can disembark. Exiting the work cell takes
them into a utilitarian personnel corridor.

If the Travellers think to ask, Stannen tells them that
a network of tunnels run under the complex and are
used to convey parts using a high-speed grav-levitation
transit system. Personnel only go in these tunnels
for maintenance; the rest of the time the system is
automated. The access corridors at just below ground
level are for people and light robots. Stannen will show
the Travellers a work in progress if they want; a free
trader being brought back from the very brink of the
scrap heap. Like many others, it was bought cheaply
after being condemned as a hazard to navigation.
When work is completed the vessel will be offered
for sale on the open market at an attractive price.
The vessel is named Adumza and her history can be
traced if the Travellers want to do so. There is nothing
untoward about her past; Adumza is simply an old ship
worn out by poor maintenance and overwork.

The Travellers are free to look around for a while but at
some point they need to take possession of the ship.
It stands ready, with gleaming paintwork and bright
metal, looking like a brand new ship. The lines of the
old Type R it was are identifiable but this is a sleek and
business-like vessel. The personnel hatches stand
open and in front of them is a well-groomed human
in the dress uniform of an RVSC executive. Stannen
introduces him as Davis Levoreen, a regional manager

##### The Great Gates of Rhylanor



who has overseen the creation of the prototype. He
is accompanied by an adminbot; essentially a self-propelled desk and portacomp terminal.

Levoreen greets the Travellers in a professionally
friendly manner and welcomes them to the project.
He says he cannot remember exactly who came up
with the idea – but says it in a manner that suggests
he is being modest. Whoever’s brainchild it was, here
is the result. A broken-down old Type R reborn as
a travelling showroom to sell starships. Rebuilt and
refurbished, on time and under budget. She is ready
to fly; all she needs is a name.

The Travellers have been given the honour of naming
the ship. Silly or rude names will be rejected as the
vessel has to maintain a professional appearance
but other than that the Travellers can decide on
whatever they like. After the name is entered by way
of the adminbot it appears on the digital nameplates
all over the ship and the status indicator next to
the name on the portacomp display switches to
‘ACTIVE’. The Travellers may or may not be moved
but for at least some of those present it is a profound
moment. The prototype was ready for operations a
moment ago but now it is alive.

Davis Levoreen asks each Traveller to identify
themselves to the adminbot, which takes the usual
biometrics and cross-references them with planetary
and interstellar databases. It then issues each Traveller
with two identicards. Most of the time the ship will
recognise individuals but these are required to set up a
given person as a crewmember, mission personnel or
someone with command responsibility. This done, the
Travellers are ready to board their ship.

###### FIRST IMPRESSIONS

The Travellers will need to proceed to the bridge in
order to log in as crew. Until they are on the ship’s
system they must physically use their identicard to
open secure doors or activate functions. This can be
a faff, since the card must be presented close to the
reader which then requires a verbal identification and
a biometric scan. Passenger status can be conferred
at the entry points but crew or mission personnel –
anyone with access to secure spaces like the bridge
or engineering chambers, or who can give orders to
the Autocrew system – can only be logged on to the
system in the command chamber.

As they proceed through the ship, the Travellers will
get an impression of understated quality. There is
nothing ostentatious about the vessel; instead it has

an air of professionalism and reliability. Trying out
appliances or systems will confirm this impression

- the ship has been very well put together with

attention to the details. The crew-recognition system is
straightforward enough but requires the crewmember
to be physically present on the bridge and the system
set to ‘open’ by someone with command level access.
This was Davis Levoreen, as the Travellers can see.
Once they close the system down only one of the
newly recognised command personnel or the mission
leader – Stannen – can open it up again to accept
new crewmembers. Anyone else can be designated
a passenger or go through the whole identification
rigmarole every time they need to open a door.

Initial exploration of the ship’s systems indicates they are
functioning at or above required standards. It is standard
practice for a new crew to run diagnostics and ground
tests on all systems even if someone else has just
finished doing the same. Apart from being a requirement
under interstellar law it is simple common sense to test a
ship before trying to fly it. Standard tests and diagnostics
can be performed in a few hours, which will give the
Travellers a chance to familiarise themselves with the
ship and establish working practices as a crew. Once
this is done, they can begin their mission.

###### TRIALS WITHOUT TRIBULATIONS

The Travellers are expected to carry out standard trials
before setting out. Systems are powered up and down,
run above and below their normal settings and with
everything switched on then with different combinations
of systems and accessories off. The intent is to find
any last bugs in the system and test for unexpected
interactions between unrelated systems. Everyone
knows the story of how a little-used galley appliance
caused an expensive liner to misjump, although nobody
can find any corroborating evidence.

The Travellers could be lazy about the trials, merely
ordering the Autocrew to go through the motions.
Testing Autocrew is part of the trials but the Travellers
should be more involved if they are doing their jobs
properly. The Referee should ask for a Difficult (10+) check in each relevant area: Pilot, Electronics (sensors), Astrogator, Engineer and Mechanic. These
checks are not to perform operations and manoeuvres
but to determine if the Traveller can spot any problems
that may exist. Any number of Travellers can make
each check and alternate skills can be used if the
Travellers are inventive. For example, during flight
systems tests someone with no piloting experience
could watch the data systems and avionics for
irregularities using Electronics (computers).

##### The Great Gates of Rhylanor

The prototype performs almost flawlessly, exceeding
expectations in most areas. There are always a few
things to fine-tune on a new ship but even this is as
straightforward as could be hoped. The Travellers may
be aware that a previous test crew did all of this and
did it meticulously, as part of the process of creating
a showcase vessel. The outcome should not be
unexpected, although the Travellers may be suspicious
that the ship is a little too good. There is nothing to
suggest there is anything awry here and indeed there
is not. Skilled people did their absolute best and were
given time to do it properly. This is a great ship, in
perfect working order.

During the trials period the Travellers will range across
the system. Approaching the naval base is not permitted
of course but they can get close enough to detect some
of the activity going on there. The battle tenders _Shirgiir_
and _Sargaan_ are exercising their battle rider squadrons
before redeploying. This is a rather controversial move;
not a year ago the navy announced it was increasing
the defences of ‘fortress Rhylanor’ to deter Zhodani
aggression. Now, and according to rumour as a result
of internal political pressure, these powerful vessels
are moving elsewhere. The navy does not comment on
deployments, nor does it answer questions about them,
but the datanets have been full of a ‘debate’ – clash is a
better word – between nobles friendly with the Duchess
of Mora and exponents of other strategies.

Nobody is giving straight answers but the rumour mill
says that one entire squadron of battle riders is to be
stationed over Trin with the other dispersed at worlds

represented by the Duchess’ friends. This translates to
populations feeling safe and being confident that their
noble representative can get things done for them,
which in turn leads to popularity and opportunities.
Meanwhile the frontier is being weakened again, say
opponents of the Duchess. Conventional wisdom states
that the Duchess of Mora is making a bid to be named
as sector duke and is both demonstrating her influence
and buying support by browbeating the sector admiral
into repositioning the fleet where she wants it.

There are other warships about. The heavy cruiser
Khishaa lazily changes course towards the Travellers’
ship, her commanding officer extending compliments
and courtesies and respectfully reminding the Travellers
they are close to restricted space. The iron fist enclosed
by this velvet glove is open about her identity and
power, whilst the capital ships beyond are secretive.
The Travellers can detect a fleet carrier and a group of
cruisers in the distance, with battleships nearby. Their
transponders do not return an identity however; they
merely show as ‘Imperial Navy Warship’ with a warning
to stay outside the vessel’s security zone.

With trials complete the Travellers are ready to set off
on their mission. First destination will be Jae Tellona,
where a demonstration has been arranged for a group
of potential clients. The Travellers have a week in jump
to plan how they want to go about this, or they may be
more inclined to just wing it. Stannen will try to push
for some kind of planning but they are not confident
enough in the role of mission leader to order Travellers
to get their act together.

##### The Great Gates of Rhylanor

Jae Tellona is significant mainly for its position,
providing as it does a jump-2 link between the rimward
arm of the Spinward Main at Belizo and the coreward
arm at Fulacin, Zivije or Celepina. A number of small
starship lines operate out of its port solely to provide a
service between these worlds. Once on the Spinward
Main or in the Rhylanor Cluster it is more economical
to transfer to a jump-1 ship unless the cargo is urgent.
For this reason the Jae Tellona Highport is the heart
of a micro-economy based on interstellar trade rather
than industry. Little of the profit from this activity
benefits the planetary population.

Jae Tellona is a harsh desert world with no free-standing
water. Its steep axial tilt means that whilst a local day is
about 36 hours long at mid latitudes, the polar regions
have a night/day cycle over two standard years long.
This is not of great importance to the population as the
majority live underground. There is little native life above
the single-cell level, although what there is tends to
be extremely hardy. This is not just due to the dry and
hot conditions; Jae Tellona has an extremely strong
magnetic field which causes spectacular aurorae in the
polar regions due to ionisation of the atmosphere. The
effect is sufficiently strong as to interfere with electronic
and gravitic equipment and is not conducive to the
development of life.

The dominant life on Jae Tellona takes the form of carpets
of algae and a variety of primitive insectoid creatures that
feed off them. The algal carpets are capable of changing
position, albeit very slowly, creeping across the surface
at a rate of up to 10 kilometres per week. None of these
creatures or the algae themselves are edible to humans
but some produce useful biochemical compounds. A
number of scientific expeditions are in progress on various
parts of Jae Tellona to learn more about the possible uses
of these compounds.

The population of Jae Tellona mostly dwell in two polar
cities, each with its own downport, and in small mining
settlements scattered across the globe. Landings
can be tricky due to ionisation interference, and are
sometimes curtailed entirely when the ‘aurora report’
indicates particularly difficult conditions. Both cities, and
the rest of the planet in theory at least, are governed by
the Imperial megacorporation Sternmetal Horizons with
oversight from the Imperial Navy.

The world has little industry of its own other than what
is needed for maintenance of the settlements and
mining installations. Its exports are mostly metal ores,
of which most are basic types that command a low
price. A few high-value deposits exist, and independent
prospectors sometimes stumble across a gem bed
or similar lucky find, but for the most part Jae Tellona
is a source of raw materials to be turned into wealth
elsewhere. Miners make a decent wage and spend it
in the cities but the population is not large enough to
generate meaningful amounts of wealth that can be
invested in developing the world as a place to live –
even if Sternmetal Horizons wanted to do so.

Jae Tellona

The early part of the Travellers’ voyage is determined by
their jump-2 range. A transit by way of Jae Tellona is the
quickest route onto the Spinward Main and the beginning
of the mission proper. Despite its Class A starport and
naval base, Jae Tellona is something of a backwater;
a place to pass through rather than visit. That does not
mean there is no profit nor adventure to be had there.

###### ARRIVING AT JAE TELLONA

Upon emerging from jump at Jae Tellona, the
Travellers’ instruments quickly confirm they are in the
right place. Traffic signals from the orbital port offer a
slot in the busy arrivals schedule and advise against
causing irregularities. A helpful list of fines for non-compliance pops up as ‘additional information’. At the
same time an automated signal from the small naval
base advises against attempting to approach.

The naval base appears to have a complement
of patrol vessels present and only two significant
warships. One is not unexpected; the fleet destroyer
Hammond. If anyone cares to check, the vessel was
named for a Second Imperium commodore of no great
reputation. There are a lot of fleet destroyers and not
all of them can have dramatic names. The other ship is
unusual. She is the Theide , a Denisov battlecruiser of
the Sword Worlds Confederation Navy. Her presence is
noteworthy; goodwill visits are sometimes undertaken
but to see a capital ship so far inside the Imperium
suggests something is afoot.

The Travellers will soon find out why. The newsfeeds
are full of stories about the capture of a notorious
Vargr corsair group’s command staff. They are due to
go on trial at Jae Tellona naval base in the next few
days, facing the death penalty on charges of piracy.
The commander of the Sword Worlds ship, Kapiten im
Raum (this translates roughly as ‘Captain in Space’)
Svan Borressen, is present to testify in their defence.
The newsfeeds are divided on this; most object that it is
none of the Sword Worlds’ business what the Imperium
does with pirates, whilst some cite the opportunity for
closer links with the Confederation or push the line that
everyone deserves a good defence. The presence of
outsiders just reinforces the Imperial commitment to
fairness and justice for all.

In the meantime, it is obvious that there is a lot of activity
in the system. Most of it is local traffic moving around the
cluster or operating on the Spinward Main feeder routes.
There are some big freighters moving in and out of the
highport’s large-ship docks – they always get priority on
docking approaches due to their size and momentum.
The highport’s shipyards also seem very busy, along
with the local supply lanes bringing components and
personnel to them. Of particular note is a new expansion
to one of the yards, which is still ongoing despite there
being ships under construction there.

The Travellers could of course just let Autocrew handle
the whole docking process. It is quite capable of liaising
with traffic control and complying with instructions.
Indeed, it might be a useful test of the system or a
chance to show off what the ship’s automated systems
can do. An Average (8+) Pilot check is required to make
a suitable approach and dock smoothly. Whether the
Travellers or the AutoBridge system does it, there are
interested eyes on them as they begin their approach.

Not everything goes as smoothly as the Travellers
would like. Their instruments inform them that another
ship is on a course that could bring it dangerously
close. The vessel is a 600-ton starship, noted as being
an Argacan multipurpose ship named Prime Example.
If the Travellers want to know more the information in
the Library Data entry on page 121 should be made
available. More data will require some investigation.

The Argacan has changed course rather suddenly,
creating a danger of collision. This should be an
infraction but for some reason traffic control is
completely ignoring the situation. The Argacan does
not respond to communications at first, creating a
situation in which the Travellers must respond without
information. At this point the AutoGunner starts asking if
the Travellers want to lock weapons on the other vessel
and AutoBridge indicates it intends to alter course in a
few seconds. This is the safe and responsible option
but will result in the Travellers losing their approach slot
and being given a new one in nearly two hours’ time.

The starport finally responds; an automated voice
transmission that informs the Travellers they are in
violation of traffic regulations. Failure to take evasive

# C COMPETITORS

#### ORSAIRS AND



action will result in their vessel being detained for
investigation and a heavy fine imposed. The port’s
only response to protests is to repeat the whole spiel.
There is a reason for this: Prime Example is a General
Products vessel, directly operated by the corporation,
and General has a ‘special relationship’ with the port
authority. Its ships get priority in pretty much everything
and in the case where there is doubt as to which vessel
has right of way, the traffic control system will always
side with General Products.

The upshot of this situation is that if the Travellers
collide with the General Products vessel – even if it is
blatantly the fault of Prime Example – they will be held
responsible. Likewise, if they refuse to yield they will be
held liable for financial losses due to Prime Example
having to reschedule docking. This is entirely unfair
but this is the world of corporate favouritism. It should
be obvious to the Travellers that shooting at the other
ship is not an option. At the very least they would be
detained for weeks awaiting trial on charges as serious
as General Products can come up with, possibly facing
incarceration or loss of licenses as well as huge fines.

One way around the problem is to convince the port
authority to honour the Travellers’ right of way since
they are on an assigned docking approach. This will
not be easy, since the port authority is heavily biased. A

difficult (10+) Advocate check will suffice providing the
Traveller can come up with some convincing-sounding
legal arguments or a scenario in which General has
to deal with a lawsuit which will keep Prime Example
entangled for a while.

The other good option is piloting finesse. The General
Products crew think they are dealing with a tubby Type
R, 1G acceleration and all that. They do not realise how
much thrust the Travellers have to play with. It would
be possible to avoid a collision without going so far off
vector that the Travellers lose their docking assignment
and without getting so close to Prime Example that a
traffic control infraction is incurred.

The plot, or whoever is instructing AutoBridge, must
make a Very Difficult (12+) Pilot check to pull off this
manoeuvre. However, they gain DM+4 for the ship’s
thrust on top of their own Pilot skill. Failure indicates
infractions are incurred rather than a collision occurring,
though on a straight double-1 the other ship has to
make an emergency manoeuvre to avoid one.

Once they are able to dock, the Travellers can proceed
through the usual customs and security checks and
make their way to the Hotel Imperial Jae Tellona,
known locally as ‘The Imperial’. This is not quite
as prestigious as the chain’s name suggests but it
is a high-quality business hotel with meeting and
conferencing facilities. Stannen is comfortable with

Manoeuvre Outcomes
Check Result Outcome
Natural 2 Prime Example makes a violent manoeuvre to avoid a collision. The Travellers will be arrested
for causing a hazard to navigation. Investigation takes 1D days and inevitably results in a guilty
verdict. RVSC is fined MCr2D and will take disciplinary action against the Travellers when it
can. The footage is used to discredit their efforts to sell this vessel, so DM-4 applies on all sales
interactions if General Products has any opportunity to make the client aware of this incident.
This outcome is in addition to any others that might apply.
Effect -6 to -4 The Travellers narrowly avert a collision with a wild manoeuvre that throws them way off
their approach vector. The Travellers face a delay of 4D+30 minutes and the ship is fined
Cr10000x2D. This is paid automatically by the AutoPurser and the Travellers may face
disciplinary action at some point. More importantly, General Products will use the footage to
embarrass RVSC, imposing DM-2 on attempts to market or sell the vessel unless there is no
chance the Travellers’ gaffe is known.
Effect -3 to -1 The Travellers avert a collision with a clumsy manoeuvre and lose their assigned docking slot. They
are delayed by 2D+15 minutes and the ship is fined Cr1000x2D. General Products uses the footage
to embarrass RVSC, imposing DM-1 on efforts to sell the ship wherever the footage has been seen.
Effect 0 The Travellers avert a collision and retain their docking slot but their ham-fisted flying fails to
impress potential clients. DM-1 applies to attempts to sell the ship at Jae Tellona only.
Effect 1–3 The Travellers avoid a collision in a smooth and professional manner.
Effect 4–6 The Travellers avoid a collision in a manner that shows off the agility of their ship. DM+1 applies
to attempts to sell the ship here at Jae Tellona.

##### Corsairs and competitors

such places due to the circles an RVSC manager
moves in and will remind Travellers if necessary that
discretion and decorum are expected.

The Travellers have a meeting scheduled for two days’
time, with some local representatives of small shipping
lines. In the meantime they can do more or less as
they like. The AutoPurser aboard their ship will take
care of reasonable expenses. In this case ‘reasonable’
is relatively extravagant. People selling starships are
expected to behave in a certain manner and frugality
can create the wrong impression. Therefore it is
acceptable for them to eat in the best restaurants
or buy trinkets in upmarket shops at the company’s
expense. This is not a license to waste money
however; a Traveller who buys a piece of nice jewellery
either for their own use or as a present is presenting
the right lifestyle and the expense will be approved.
Trying to buy six luxury grav cars or a dozen new guns
is not considered acceptable. Common sense applies
here – a set of several sporting shotguns might be a
legitimate ‘lifestyle’ or ‘facilitation’ purchase – the latter
refers to items used as social tools to gain access to an
elite group, in this case by going shooting with them.

###### INVESTIGATING^

###### GENERAL PRODUCTS

If the Travellers choose to investigate General Products
and the behaviour of its personnel, some information is
immediately available. General bought a small shipyard
a few years ago and have expanded it greatly ever
since. The megacorporation has obviously poured
money into the project. It is common knowledge that
this sort of thing buys a lot of influence; secondary
industries become dependent on the big money and
officials want to keep the megacorporation happy.
This can lead to the present situation, where the
megacorporation automatically receives preferential
treatment and can quickly gain control of a situation by
means of influence or more underhand methods.

**ASKING AROUND**
Travellers who do a bit of old-fashioned asking around
will find there are two different attitudes to General
Products locally. Those who have benefited from the
influx of funding have nothing bad to say even if they are
thinking something different. However, there are plenty
of people who have lost out or feel they have been
mistreated by the megacorporation and its new lackeys.
Small businesses in particular have suffered since
corporate buyers want low, low prices and are intolerant

of problems no matter who caused them. Others have
been subject to the same treatment as the Travellers got
on docking approach and resent the situation.

There is no solid indication of criminality on the part
of General Products, just hard business practice and
exploitation of a favourable situation. However, this
does not mean there is no resentment and therefore
people willing to point fingers and make allegations.
Most of these are specific to an individual or a
business that has lost out and may not be useful to the
Travellers. Collecting enough opinions to be useful will
require talking to a lot of people and finding some who
are willing to tell their full story.

An Average (8+) Streetwise check will enable the
Travellers to put together a picture of the situation at
ground level: General Products has clearly dumped
a great deal of money into the Jae Tellona operation
and has been particularly blatant in using its money
to win legal but morally questionable victories over its
opponents. Multiple Travellers can make this attempt and
a combined Effect of 4+ produces additional information.

Apparently, General Products invested a lot of money
in its shipyard at Jae Tellona around 1070–80, setting
up a specialist production facility for the Kinunir
vanguard or colonial cruiser. This was either a reckless
investment or the megacorporation knew something
others did not, because at the time orders were small
for the new design. In the event, even the short run
originally ordered was curtailed and the design largely
forgotten about. A few years ago General began
throwing money around, converting the production
facility to build other designs and greatly expanding
it. Again, this investment seems based on insider
knowledge, or else General Products are just keen on
wasting money.

SEARCHING THE RECORDS


Raking through old datanet entries and news reports is
a time-consuming business but Travellers willing to put
in a day or so may make an Average (8+) Investigate
check. Success results in a pieced-together picture of
heavy investment much like that indicated by hearsay,
with some additional information. General Products is as
secretive as other megacorporations about its dealings,
making press releases as it suits the firm’s agenda.
These mostly trumpet how many jobs have been created
or how the new designs coming out of the local yards will
revolutionise transportation in the region.

Among all of this are notes on transactions with former
suppliers of components for the ill-fated Kinunir. The
volume of production from the Jae Tellona yards does

##### Corsairs and competitors



not match the materials going in. The discrepancy is
not large; around 5-6,000 tons of shipping over the
past three years. That would equate to four or maybe
five vessels of the Kinunir built on the quiet. These is
nothing illicit about that; General Products might be
trying to relaunch the class and creating demonstration
vessels, or they may have orders from a client who
wants a version of those ships for some reason.

An Effect of 4+ on the Investigate check (this can come
from more than one Traveller, providing everyone
puts the time in) will confirm this suspicion. General
Products did not convert all the Kinunir construction
slips to other uses and has chosen to leave them
unchanged whilst building new slips for other vessels.
The only logical explanation is that General Products
has resumed the production of this class. Why they
would do so remains unclear.

###### SALES PITCH

The Travellers’ scheduled meeting with the clients
can take place at their hotel’s conference suite or
aboard their ship... or any other location they deem
appropriate. There were to be three potential clients
present but two cancel at the last moment without
providing a reason. Prodding will get the Travellers
nowhere; they are dealing with an automated
scheduling system which simply repeats that the client
apologises for being unable to attend.

The clients originally scheduled were:
•	 CEO Hector Zarr, representing Rhylanor Freight
Services LIC
•	 Director of Procurement Ruelle Laugur,
representing ShortHop Shipping LIC
•	 Sir Ba-abtab Atwa, representing General
Procurement, LIC

If the Travellers are interested in why these
representatives cancelled at the last minute, they
will have to investigate. No additional information is
available from their local offices. A direct approach,
such as barging in and demanding answers, would lead
to legal complications so a more subtle investigation is
necessary. One way to go about this would be to look
at publicly available information regarding policies and
transactions. There is little obvious but an Average (8+)
Investigate check reveals something interesting about
each potential client:
•	 Rhylanor Freight Services is currently diverting some
of its ships or rushing them to the loading docks.
Others have already left, to an in-system destination.

They are not going far, just responding to an urgent
short-term contract to deliver quantities of materials
to the General Products shipyard. It is clear that
the firm has been bought off with a fat contract on
condition it boycotts the RVSC pitch.
•	 ShortHop Shipping was about to go to court over
several lawsuits brought by General Products.
There are no details available but it seems the
megacorporation was trying to harass and bully
the smaller firm, a common corporate tactic. All
pending cases have suddenly been postponed.
There is nothing conclusive about this but it is
likely there is a connection between ShortHop
pulling out of discussions with RVSC and the
curtailment of legal action.
•	 Sir Ba-abtab Atwa, however, does attend. He is a
Bwap, as the Travellers can probably tell from his
name. Bwaps are excellent natural administrators
and it is not uncommon to find them in senior
bureaucratic posts all across the Imperium. Sir Ba-abtab Atwa is also an Imperial knight, suggesting
that either he has served very well or his family did
so at some time in the past.

As representative for General Procurement, Sir Ba-abtab Atwa is actually the most prestigious of the
potential clients. He will be impressed by an orderly
atmosphere for the meeting and by solid projections of
cost and return – he favours hard numbers over pizazz
and salesmanship. The Travellers might realise this if
they think about the nature of Bwaps and may be able
to tailor their approach to his expected characteristics.

MAKING THE PITCH


However they choose to do it, the Travellers’ pitch to Sir
Ba-abtab Atwa will need to be set up in advance and
there is a protocol to be followed. He is a representative
of a body that may spend a lot of money on starships
and is used to moving in diplomatic and high-end
corporate circles. Whilst he will focus on the deal rather
than the wrappings, so to speak, Sir Ba-abtab Atwa
will be slightly offended by a gee-whiz or manipulative
mind games approach. This will impose DM-2 on his
reactions, although he is unlikely to show it. A straight
and professional approach will be best in this case.

Sir Ba-abtab Atwa begins with his credentials. This
is normal but in this case the experience may be
excruciating for the Travellers. He cites every company
General Procurement has worked with, their employee
numbers, location of key facilities, turnover and major
projects in the past 20 years. And he does it in detail.
Travellers who manage to sit through the whole thing
without obviously fidgeting or making snarky remarks

##### Corsairs and competitors

will pass his professionalism test – although this is not
a deliberate test, it is the way Sir Ba-abtab Atwa does
business. Those who cannot even manage the basics
like paying attention through a 30-minute exposition
of every job his company has ever done will not be
favoured. DM-1 will apply (in addition to any others)
to his reactions if the Travellers fidget or mess about.
Besides, they might learn something useful...

The high points – if that is the word – of Sir Ba-abtab
Atwa’s spiel are:
•	 General Procurement handles procurement and
disposal of components and whole vessels for a
variety of third-party clients including the Imperial
Navy and the Duke of Regina.
•	 The firm recently established a long-chain supply
project for naval munitions for an unspecified client
and a disposal route for expired warheads. This
will permit a gradual expansion of stocks without
straining the local production capability.
•	 General Procurement is one of the few firms licensed
to handle full-capability naval ships on behalf of its
clients and has passed stringent tests to become
certified as a handler of nuclear munitions.
•	 Recently, General Procurement organised the
transfer of several obsolescent escort and patrol
craft from the subsector fleets in Lanth and Rhylanor
to local governments. Naturally, he expects a
contract to find suitable replacement candidates and
is surprised that one has not yet been offered.
•	 General Procurement is on contract to the
Rhylanor and Lanth Subsector fleets to source
vessels and components.
•	 Recently the firm successfully located components
to permit the government of Lanth to keep four old
in-system defence vessels in commission for at
least another 20 years, saving the system defence
force millions of Credits in replacement vessels.

This goes on for quite a while, until eventually Stannen
is able to put RVSC’s credentials forward. This is a
rather more succinct presentation, after which the
Travellers can finally get down to business. In short,
General Procurement is always looking out for new
designs and new suppliers that will fit its clients’ needs.
The firm is willing to look at the new conversions on
offer and to consider recommending them to clients.
There can be no instant decisions to buy multiple ships;
this is an initial pitch to open negotiations if General
Procurement is sufficiently interested.

The Travellers can make their pitch any way they like but
in this case a simple and straightforward presentation
is best. As already noted, a dog and pony show will

alienate Sir Ba-abtab Atwa and impose a negative
DM. Travellers who make a simple presentation get no
positive DM but those who roleplay delivering a glacier
of facts, statistics and ever more numbers should be
granted DM+1 or even +2 if they do it well. Ultimately,
the Travellers must make an Average (8+) Diplomat or a
Difficult (10+) Persuade check. Failure indicates Sir Ba-abtab Atwa is not interested at this time, though he may
be open to a revised pitch later.

Success does not instantly sell starships. However, if
the Travellers succeed in the check Sir Ba-abtab Atwa
opens lengthy negotiations with RVSC. Eventually this
may lead to a recommendation that a client considers a
rebuilt RVSC ship rather than buying new. It will be many
months before this bears fruit but the Travellers will
have succeeded in their mission at a basic level and will
qualify for the Jae Tellona Bonus (see page 104). If the
Travellers achieve Effect 4+, Sir Ba-abtab Atwa is quite
enthused. Since he is a Bwap this naturally translates
as a desire for even more numbers. Do the Travellers
have metal fatigue projections for the port side aerofin?
Do they know if it is possible for six unassisted humans
to move a standard cargo container from the farthest
corner of the cargo bay in the event of a cargo handling
system failure? How long would that take? How would
such heavy labour affect nutrition requirements for the
crew and how does that affect operating budget?

Sir Ba-abtab Atwa can go on like this forever and
many of his questions exceed their available data. So
long as they make an effort, and perhaps have some
fun playing out the scene, they will qualify for the
Jae Tellona Enhanced Bonus. Sir Ba-abtab Atwa will
make a recommendation to some of his clients, setting
up secondary meetings with RVSC personnel. The
Travellers may not have the same sense of triumph as
conquering a mountain or defeating a mob of enemies
in a fistfight, but they have done a good job and can
expect to be rewarded.

SIR BA-ABTAB ATWA
Sir Ba-abtab Atwa is a member of a reptilian species
known as Bawapakerwa-a-a-awapawab, which is
shortened to Bwap on most occasions. Like most
members of his species, Sir Ba-abtab Atwa is obsessed
with details and minutiae, and loves sifting through
data looking for patterns. His personal comm is loaded
with insanely hard puzzles which he enjoys solving
whenever he has a few moments to spare. His role
with General Procurement is no accident; Bwaps are
excellent administrators and he comes from a family
ennobled for their services to the Imperial bureaucracy.

##### Corsairs and competitors



Like most Bwaps outside their swampy home
environment Sir Ba-abtab Atwa wears a loose kaftan-like garment designed to keep his skin moist. Even so
he finds human-normal conditions uncomfortable and
will drink a great deal of water during any encounter.
He has been working in human-standard conditions
all his adult life and is used to this but does very much
enjoy getting back to his climate-controlled quarters at
the end of a day of meetings. Attempts to somehow use
his discomfort against him simply do not work; he is a
consummate professional. Indeed, he will sometimes
extend meetings when something interests him.

The key to piquing Sir Ba-abtab Atwa’s interest and
enthusiasm is numbers. Hard, cold numbers, the more
detailed the better. He has a natural talent for pulling
trends and projections out of a column of statistics, and
loves doing it. His enthusiasm takes the form of intense
concentration rather than physical excitement but in his
soul Sir Ba-abtab Atwa is flying on a magic carpet of hard
data. His work with General Procurement might make
him a useful contact in the future, or perhaps a source of
information. He may also have work for the Travellers.

###### EXPERT WITNESS

Soon after completing their business with General
Procurement, the Travellers are informed there is a
gentleman to see them. The information will probably
come by way of hotel staff or a messenger-bot which
darts up and delivers its invitation to meet with the
un-named gentleman. There is no indication of who
this is but the invite suggests a meeting at a place
‘the gentleman’ has hired. He is willing to come to the
Travellers, of course.

If the Travellers ignore the invite they may later hear
about how a Sword Worlds battlecruiser captain spoke
eloquently in defence of some captured Vargr corsairs,
and that for some unknown reason the case against
them was suddenly dropped on the verge of a guilty
verdict. They will not get the chance to take part in
these events, however.

If they do, the Travellers find themselves in the presence
of Kapiten im Raum Svan Borressen, commanding
officer of a Denisov-class battlecruiser. Anyone with even
a passing knowledge of the Sword Worlds Confederation
will know that this is the most prestigious vessel an
officer can command and that this Svan Borressen must
be an important man back home. He is not, however,
what most Imperials would expect.

Well-groomed and softly spoken for the most part,
Borressen is impeccably dressed in the formal uniform
of his position, not all that different to an Imperial Navy
uniform, perhaps with a little more braid. Whilst he
does wear a Holmgang Sword at his belt, there are
no ‘Viking braids’ or fur shoulder-pieces; none of the
identifying marks that Imperial entertainment vids like
to assign to Sword Worlders. Polite and well-mannered,
yet at the same time assured and confident of his own
importance, Borressen greets the Travellers and invites
them to take some refreshments with him.

Borressen’s Galanglic is accented and occasionally
contains an unfamiliar idiom but he is anything but the
‘space barbarian’ depicted in entertainment vids and the
more questionable news broadcasts. He explains that
he is the captain of the ship’s company of the Theide ,
a vessel of the Denisov-class, and is on a diplomatic
mission to the Imperium. He says this without any
attempt to stress his or the ship’s importance – those
who do not understand are not worth his time and
anyone who does know will be impressed without any
need for a tawdry display of self-importance.

Kapiten Borressen has a favour to ask of the
Travellers. They are representatives of a starship-related corporation and therefore could be presented

SIR BA-ABTAB ATWA
STR 2 DEX 8 END 5 INT 9 EDU 10 SOC 10

Skills: Admin 6, Advocate 2, Diplomat 3

##### Corsairs and competitors

as expert witnesses in an important legal case. He
would like them to take a look at the situation and
consider whether they would be willing to testify in the
defence of a band of Vargr corsairs who were recently
captured by the Imperial Navy. They are being
portrayed as pirates and will face the death penalty.
Borressen considers this unfair and has decided to
intervene on their behalf. He asks that the Travellers
at least listen to the situation.

###### THE ZUENG CONUNDRUM

During the Fourth Frontier War, the Vargr corsair group
known as the Zueng pledged its loyalty to the so-called
Outworld Coalition. In return for a payment and plunder
rights, the group joined several others in launching
attacks on Imperial shipping. The Zueng were particularly
audacious; they are known to have raided as far as Trin’s
Veil and even took a supply ship in the Mora system. It
is clear that Borressen respects this achievement but
perhaps that is not surprising. His people admire daring
and audacity, and particularly those who are smart
enough to get away with their deeds.

The Zueng were hunted as pirates but maintain they
were mercenaries conducting commerce raiding on
behalf of a client rather than pirates seeking plunder.
The judge in this case is refusing to consider the
difference, especially as some members of the Zueng
have behaved as outright pirates before and since
the war. The likely outcome is that the whole group
will be sentenced to death just for being members
of the Zueng and Borressen does not think this is
fair. For this reason he demanded to be allowed to
speak in the defence of the Zueng and his status as a
diplomatic envoy from the Sword Worlds was enough
to obtain a grudging agreement.

Borressen does not think his testimony will be enough
and is trying to find expert witnesses to assist him. If they
agree, the Travellers will receive an expert witness fee
from the court, amounting to Cr500 each per day and
more importantly they will be championing justice against
serious odds. What honourable spacefarers could
refuse? If the Travellers decline, Borressen accepts their
position with good grace and bids them farewell.

**THE CASE AGAINST THE ZUENG**
The Zueng is a ‘known pirate organisation’ according
to the Imperium, with members automatically assumed
to be connected with piracy. This warrants arrest on
sight but does not mean the subject is guilty of piracy
or any associated offence. It is still necessary to
prove the subject has engaged in piracy or activities

in support of piracy but many courts are prone to
consider this proven on the flimsiest of evidence. This
appears to be the case here, and the proceedings so
far have been distinctly biased.

The Zueng leadership maintain they are a mercenary
group and not pirates, and that those who have crossed
the line into outright piracy have always been expelled.
This may or may not be the truth. This particular group
were not directly engaged in piracy when they were
apprehended – they could not have been, as they did
not have a ship! They are a delegation of senior Zueng
officials who were travelling by liner from outside the
Imperium to Garda-Vilis in the Vilis subsector. They
have stated their intent was to meet with officials of the
Tanoose Freedom League to discuss how the League
might be supplied with weaponry.

The Tanoose Freedom League is a rebel organisation,
although one that professes loyalty to the Imperium. It
is in revolt against the imposed government of Garda-Vilis which it accuses of corruption and profiteering on a
planetary scale. This makes the intentions of the Zueng
distinctly questionable but since the Imperium itself
has not taken a position on the rebellion, supporting it
cannot be said to be directly anti-Imperial.

The six Zueng members on trial are all middle-aged
Vargr, old enough to have taken part in operations
during the Fourth Frontier War. None has admitted
doing so, but to be senior in the Zueng today they
must have served aboard some of its ships in their
youth. Essentially, this means the case against the six
comes down to the fact they may have served aboard
ships carrying out what the Imperium calls piracy but
the Zueng maintains was legitimate commerce raiding
and they are members of an organisation that has at
times engaged in piracy.

This is a flimsy case, with no evidence of actual piracy
in the past or any intention of doing so in the present.
Nevertheless the court is hostile and the outcome looks
clear. Kapiten Borressen hopes to reverse that. He has
a case of his own to present but is looking for additional
support. As experts in the commercial starship field, the
Travellers may be able to provide useful insight or at
least some gravitas to his appeal. What he is hoping is to
present a case that commerce raiding is a legitimate act of
war and therefore anything the Zueng did was not piracy.
He wants to use the Travellers as expert witnesses who
will answer his questions to the best of their ability and
stresses, quite truthfully, that he does not want them to lie
or present a particular agenda. He just wants someone
credible and unbiased to respond to his questions.

##### Corsairs and competitors



ABOARD A DENISOV


If the Travellers agree, Borressen invites them to
dine aboard his ship. He will send a shuttle for them
in a few hours and in the meantime must prepare for
his presentation. If the Travellers accept they will be
greeted aboard the battlecruiser Thiele with courtesy
and decorum. The ship is, of course, spotless and in
perfect condition as all vessels on a diplomatic mission
are expected to be. The crew are smartly turned out
and professional in appearance.

The main difference between the Sword Worlds vessel
and an Imperial one is the lack of formality. Borressen
gives most of his orders as requests or statements
of what he would like to happen and his crew
acknowledge rather casually most of the time. ‘Okay,
Svan’ is an entirely acceptable response, providing the
order is obeyed of course. If asked to explain, any of
the crew can do so. ‘A true leader is always respected
and those who have given loyalty are bound by honour
to obey’. Rather than obedience to an imposed chain
of command, the Sword Worlds system is based on
a personal feeling of duty. What happens to those
deemed unfit to lead is open to speculation.

Dinner is a full-dress affair for Borressen and his
officers. There are a couple of women among them,
who are respected as much as any other holder of
their rank. However, they are very much in the minority.
Borressen’s officers are well educated and familiar
with Imperial popular culture, and happy to discuss
most subjects. They will be offended at attacks on their
culture and would consider Travellers who made them
to be boors and bigots.

The crew and officers are quite open about their
mission, saying it is a goodwill visit that just
coincidentally allows them to get a look at the Imperial
fleet... and lets the Imperials show them how scary
their fleet is. They openly accept that interstellar powers
play this game all the time and that it can be quite fun
to answer in a forthright manner when an Imperial
official tries to cleverly wangle the truth out of them.
‘Are you carrying out espionage?’ gets responses like
‘Why yes, what fool would not be?’ and ‘Do you have
nuclear warheads aboard your ship?’ merits a response
like ‘Well, yes. You can’t expect us to pop home to get
them if a war breaks out, now can you?’ There are
many tales of situations like this, in which ‘clever’ and
devious Imperials were bamboozled by the naked truth.

Eventually Borressen explains what he wants the
Travellers to do. It is not complex; he will put them on
the witness stand as neutral experts and ask questions.

Nothing more than that and no duplicity. He cannot, he
says with a chuckle, promise the prosecution will be so
honourable. They will ask their own questions if they
wish and the Travellers are expected to answer.

If the Travellers want to see around the ship, they
will be given a tour. Anything sensitive will be locked
up of course but the Travellers can take a look at the
engineering chambers, the bridge and most other
sections of the ship. It is in excellent condition, as a
vessel sent on a flag-showing cruise should be, and
the crew are efficient at their jobs. Although not as
technologically advanced as an Imperial navy vessel,
the Denisov battlecruiser is certainly a powerful
vessel. Borressen’s comment on that is typical of him,
‘The more Imperials know that, the less likely I will
have to kill them’. This is a rather blunt reference to
flag-showing as deterrence but is also indicative of
Borressen’s personality. He will fight ruthlessly if he has
to but would prefer peace through sufficient firepower.
Sufficient, since he knows his people are massively
outgunned by the Imperials but are tough enough to
make them pay a price for any victory they might win.

###### TRIAL OF THE ZUENG

Borressen has already arranged for the Travellers to
be added to the trial. The prosecution is not pleased,
since they were confident of winning despite their weak
case. They cite numerous instances of vessels that went
missing as well as some that were definitely attacked. For
their part, the Zueng members refuse to confirm nor deny
they took part in any given action and dismiss several
of the allegations as spurious. Their legal representative
points out that several of the ‘kills’ attributed to the Zueng
are normally considered mysterious losses connected
with the Abyss Rift and suggests it is rather odd that the
prosecution suddenly wants these to be victims of piracy.

Borressen then calls his expert witnesses. He begins a
rather bold defence of the Zueng members by stating that
he fought in the Fourth Frontier War. He was an officer
aboard the cruiser Sigurd , which famously raided Imperial
shipping during that conflict. Is the prosecution saying
he is a pirate too? What then of the Imperial personnel
who raided his people or the Zhodani Consulate? Are
they all pirates or just the ones the Imperials do not like?
This is risky, since Borressen is presenting evidence
that a hostile court could use to convict him of piracy. On
the other hand, he is on a diplomatic mission and the
Imperials will not want an incident.

Not content with this, Borressen begins calling
witnesses starting with Admiral Carlos Santoncheev,
commander of the Imperial Spinward Marches fleet.

##### Corsairs and competitors

Borressen reels off a long list of Imperial command
officers, stating that every one of them is a witness for
the defence because the Imperial Navy has carried out
commerce raiding operations and will do so again in
the future. With no evidence against them other than
membership of an organisation branded pirates by the
Imperials, the Zueng members are no more guilty of
piracy than any naval officer or rating willing to carry out
a raid if ordered to do so.

Borressen has an excellent point. There is no specific
evidence of any act that could be considered piracy.
The court will not wait weeks whilst someone goes to
Macene to fetch the sector admiral and does not want
to obey Borressen’s demands in general. He is fine with
that; it was a piece of theatre and nothing more. He does,
however want to cross-examine the expert witnesses. His
questions, and those of the prosecution, are noted below.

**BORRESSEN’S QUESTIONS TO THE TRAVELLERS**
Borressen obviously wants neutral ‘experts’ to make
certain statements in the courtroom. His questions are
geared towards that goal, although his agenda may or
may not be apparent:
•	 You are experienced spacefarers, are you not?
•	 The vessel you crew... is it armed?
•	 Why is your vessel armed?
•	 Does possession of this weaponry make you a
danger to shipping?
•	 If you were under attack you would fight, would
you not?
•	 Would you fight to protect a friend, or someone you
owed loyalty to?
•	 If your friend or someone you owed loyalty to was
threatened by a great beast too powerful for them or
you to fight, would you stand by and let them die?
•	 Perhaps you might try to distract the beast?
•	 What if your friend was fighting for their life against
a mob? Would you try to get some of them to
chase you instead?
•	 If the only way to distract the mob was to threaten
someone they cared about, would you do it to save
a friend’s life?
•	 If your ship became disabled and what you needed
to save it was nearby but did not belong to you,
might you take it?
•	 Would you do the same to rescue a stranded friend?
•	 If an unarmed man were carrying ammunition
to someone firing at you, would you consider it
acceptable to shoot them?
•	 Would you consider it acceptable to prevent
materials reaching a weapons factory, if you know
its products will be used against you?

•	 Have you or have you not just stated that you
consider it acceptable to attack someone or
something your enemy will rush to protect in order
to save a friend? Have you just stated that you
might take what you or a friend needed in order to
save them or you?

Borressen wants to lead the Travellers, who in this
case represent ‘the common spacefarer’, to say they
consider commerce raiding acceptable as it weakens
an enemy and draws off some of their warships. He
also wants to push the idea that scavenging wrecks
after a fight is not the same as piracy for profit and that
raiding is a legitimate form of warfare even if the victims
are unarmed civilians. The prosecution really have no
counter to this. ‘But they’re... pirates!!!’ is not much of
a legal argument and in any case there is no evidence
that piracy took place at all. The prosecution had relied
on muddying the waters and blurring the line between
commerce raiding and piracy. Instead what they have is:
•	 The Zueng had a legitimate warfighting reason to
attack Imperial shipping. Their attacks cannot be
assumed to be piratical in nature without evidence
of a specific profit motivation.
•	 The attacks cannot be considered war crimes
without convicting Borressen, Santoncheev and the
entire Imperial Navy.
•	 Even where wrecks were plundered the possibility
exists that the raiders were searching for items
they needed to repair their ship or to support
themselves, or which could be used to support the
war effort elsewhere.
•	 Therefore, there is no case against the Zueng
members for piracy without specific evidence – and
there is none.

This all assumes the Travellers make a good case that
is useful to Borressen. If they want the Zueng to be
found guilty they could derail his defence of course,
or they might decline to take part. The Travellers face
no penalties in any case – telling the truth in a court is
not an offence, no matter how political the case may
be. There is, of course, a political dimension to all
of this. The Zueng are aiding the Tanoose Freedom
League and thereby acting against an Imperial member
government. The authorities wanted to block this and a
conviction would suffice.

If the Vargr are convicted, they will be deported from
Imperial territory. If they or other members of the Zueng
subsequently return to any Imperial system they face
long-term imprisonment. This is really what the authorities
were hoping for; an excuse to ban the organisation and
simplify actions against its members. If the Travellers

##### Corsairs and competitors



confound this the Tanoose Freedom League will receive
additional weapons and support, to the detriment of the
Vilis government and possibly the wider Imperium.

If the Travellers successfully assist Borressen, he
is grateful and respectful of them as honourable
starfarers. In time he may become a friend, or at least
a Contact to be called upon from time-to-time. His ship
departs Jae Tellona soon after the trial ends – with the
Zueng members aboard. The Travellers may wonder if
he was in league with them all along but this is not the
case. He was just doing what he thought was right. The
Travellers may encounter Borressen or the Zueng later
but not before they reach Arden and great events begin
to unfold around them.

KAPITEN IM RAUM SVAN BORRESSEN


Kapiten Borressen is a high flyer in the Sword Worlds
Confederation Navy. By a combination of charisma, drive
and talent he gained rapid promotion, rising to command
a small escort then increasingly powerful ships. He is
confident and assured, and subscribes to the ideal that
truly effective people do not need to make a noise about
their achievements. Anyone worth his time knows how
impressive he is; those that cannot see it are irrelevant.

Borressen runs a highly effective crew in a relaxed
manner. He believes it is important to make sure
everyone knows what is expected of them and is
offered help if they need it. Once expectations and
capabilities are established he is intolerant of laziness
and stupidity, and he is distinctly contemptuous of
those who have little drive or competence. Fakers
are a particular hate of his, as they are not merely a
dangerous hole in an otherwise capable crew; they are
also deceiving their crewmates.

If required, Borressen will do what is necessary
to defeat his enemies. He finds commerce raiding
distasteful but would carry it out without hesitation as he
knows it weakens the Imperials and draws off their fleet.
He would prefer military targets and relishes the idea of
putting his battlecruiser alongside a major Imperial ship
in a straight and honourable fight. However, his duty
is to win the war rather than chasing glory. He knows
he has been trusted with command of a very fine and
prestigious ship, and he is expected to use it in the
most effective manner possible. This probably means
an audacious raiding cruise with a well-timed return
to base in order to preserve the asset that is his ship.
However, he would consider sacrificing the vessel if the
inspirational value were great enough. Could he make it
all the way to Deneb, drawing dozens of Imperial ships
after him? Borressen would like to try.

Fulacin lies on the Spinward Main but whilst its
excellent orbital starport receives large volumes
of shipping hardly anyone visits the surface. The
officially recorded population is around 800, all of
them employees of the firm MagnetoDynamics or their
dependents. At any given time there are a great many
more temporary workers and contractors on-planet who
do not have the status of permanent residents.

At first glance the world’s profile suggests it may be
ripe for colonisation but this is not the case. There
is sufficient water and a theoretically breathable
atmosphere but both are tainted by heavy metal dust
which causes respiratory illnesses in a short period and
longer-term health problems if the victim survives. As
a result Fulacin received a token ‘landgrab’ population
whose main purpose was to serve the starport.

To this day much of the planet remains unexplored.
It has been mapped from orbit of course but with so
many worlds to develop this one remains very low on
the list of priorities. There is an advanced ecosystem
which includes species sometimes found elsewhere in
the sector. Among these is the groat, a hardy herbivore
which seems resistant to the world’s taint and an
aggressive predator often known as the snowcat.

###### MAGNETODYNAMICS

As a link on the Spinward Main, Fulacin required
a starport. For many years this was a small orbital
installation providing little more than fuel to passing
ships, paired with an even smaller downport which was
home to around 200 people. Defining some of these
as residents of Fulacin created a planetary population
who could be granted Imperial Member status, thereby
making Fulacin Imperial territory. This was sufficient for
the authorities and for many decades the world was
more or less forgotten.

The arrival of MagnetoDynamics in 1040 saw an
influx of workers and an expansion of the downport
into something resembling a very small city. Other
settlements were set up here and there, if local
conditions favoured an extraction plant. The downport
grew into a ‘corp town’ where every business was
licensed by MagnetoDynamics and most services were
provided directly by the company. Existing businesses

were bought out or brought under company license, in
general without difficulty. MagnetoDynamics is today
effectively the world government.

The region around the downport, now designated
Fulacin Down, is surrounded by large towers which draw
in atmospheric gases and process them to extract useful
chemicals. Similar plants line the shores of nearby seas.
The plants are mostly automated, with inspection crews
rotating endlessly among them. It is a measure of how
much of a backwater Fulacin is that no protests have
been lodged against the alteration of natural atmospheric
content. Some local lifeforms appear to be moving away
from the regions downwind from the towers or becoming
scarcer in those regions. MagnetoDynamics appears to
have no interest in investigating the ecological effects
of its activities other than to issue the now notorious
statement that ‘the groats don’t taste any different'.

Away from Fulacin Down there is little but vast
wilderness, with the odd atmospheric processing tower
or shore installation on the horizon. A few prospecting
camps have been set up, mostly by independent groups
operating under licence from MagnetoDynamics. Few
of these are permanent and fewer still have led to
exploitation efforts. Even when good deposits are found
the company tends to just buy the rights and tag the area
as a reserve for future exploitation. Offers from small
mining firms to subcontract for extraction are politely
declined. The few mining sites that have been set up are
mostly small and tend to be proof-of-value operations
rather than profitable mines.

# R ESCUE AT FULACIN

The Travellers’ point of entry to the Spinward Main is
at Fulacin. The intent is to make a refuelling stop at the
highport and move on, as so many vessels do. There is
no meeting scheduled at this world, although that is no
reason not to show off the ship or try to find additional
clients. There is quite a lot of traffic around the highport,
most of it jump-1 ships going one way or the other
along the Spinward Main or jump-2 vessels in from
Jae Tellona. As the Travellers take their place in the
docking approach queue, anyone on the bridge is likely
to notice some anomalous readings from the planet
below. They are inconclusive and soon gone. The most
likely explanation is that Fulacin’s atmospheric taint is
interfering with local comms signals causing ionisation
or some other sensor ghost producing effect. This
impression is broadly correct – Fulacin’s atmospheric
taint does cause some interference.

The Travellers can make as much or as little of their
stopover at Fulacin highport as they like. A couple of days
away from the ship is useful to prevent crew fatigue and
they do have permission to run up reasonable expenses
in keeping with the lifestyle of starship sales reps. Side
adventures and random encounters might ensue but at
some point the Travellers will depart. Their destination is
a port further spinward on the main but before they reach
the jump point other events intervene.

Another sensor anomaly is detected. This one is
stronger and more persistent than the first. The location
is similar, allowing for atmospheric distortion. As the
Travellers are wondering what it might be, their sensor
system begins behaving very oddly. Data, in the form of
incomprehensible numbers, begins to be presented in
tables which are apparently cross-referencing with one
another. This is not an AutoBridge feature. After a few
moments the tables disappear and are replaced with
an image of a wedge-shaped starship that might be
familiar to the Travellers. It is a Kinunir-class ‘cruiser’,
and its image is accompanied by a summary table.

VESSEL TYPE: Kinunir-class 78.2% Confidence.
VESSEL IDENTITY: Unknown.
LOCATION: Planetary Surface.
CONDITION: Structurally Intact 88.4% Confidence.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: Debris nearby. Low
power readings. Negative transponder.

ANALYSIS: Vessel has been forced to crash-land or
has been brought down. Communications offline or
deliberately disabled.

This information dump has been triggered by a low-powered distress signal emitted by the wreck on an
unusual band. It would be mistaken for interference
by anyone without the equipment to decode it. That
has been done automatically by the intelligence
package aboard the prototype, which might prompt the
Travellers to wonder what secrets their ship is hiding.
Nobody on board knows about the package, so there
are no immediate answers to be had.

The Travellers will need to decide what to do with
the information, however. Nobody else has received
it and unless a navy ship gets close enough to pick
up the signal it will be lost. The Travellers could of
course just head for their next destination but there
is a mystery and a chance for profit here. It is not
necessary to obtain permission to enter orbit; the
port cares only about its docking approaches and the
planetside installations handle their own traffic control
whenever they get a visiting ship. The Travellers can
discreetly land and investigate if they choose to do so.
There might be salvage rights, rewards for a rescue
or the chance to rifle through the contents of a navy
warship... and all theoretically legitimate since they are
responding to a distress signal.

###### A ZHODANI CONSPIRACY

The vessel downed on Fulacin is an Improved Kinunir
patrol destroyer named Malishu. It is not a vessel of the
Imperial Navy – not yet at least. The ship is more or less
complete and was ostensibly out on trials when it came
to Fulacin, although there was more to the mission than
that. General Products hopes to secure a big contract
to supply the subsector fleets in the Rhylanor and Lanth
subsectors with patrol vessels and is going about it in
an underhand manner. Malishu came to Fulacin to meet
another vessel. This was the yacht Calston Riviera,
personal transport of Sir Hamex Calston.

Sir Hamex Calston holds the rank of commodore in the
Imperial Navy and is assigned to the procurement and
disposal department of the sector fleet. He is currently

on leave, officially listed as taking care of some family
business but is in fact meeting with representatives of
General Products in regard to the procurement of an
entire class of starship. In short, the intention was that
he be ‘just passing through the Fulacin system’ when
a General Products vessel happened by and was ‘so
impressed by its capabilities’ that he just had to send a
glowing recommendation to his superiors. This is a rather
sleazy bypass of the normal procurement procedure
and unfair to competitors but Sir Calston was sure of a
large payment from General Products which soothed any
misgivings. Unfortunately, everything went wrong.

The seeds of this disaster were planted just after the
Fourth Frontier War, when a programme of placing
operatives on important Imperial worlds was expanded.
Those sent to places like Rhylanor and Trin were
expected to gather intelligence and perhaps someday
engage in sedition, assassination or sabotage missions.
They might even act as or direct a fifth column to assist
in an invasion attempt. Some were active agents, some
‘sleepers’ who did not even know they were Zhodani
until their psionic conditioning was triggered.

Alongside these major-world projects, operatives were
inserted to many backwater and minor systems; places
like Fulacin. These were dedicated people, their loyalty
and determination enhanced by psionic conditioning.
Their purpose was looser than elsewhere – essentially
they were to be ready for when they were needed,
without a particular mission. So it was with Fulacin. A
group of operatives was inserted among the ‘Wildcatter’
population; people unaffiliated with MagnetoDynamics.

The Wildcatters are not supposed to be on Fulacin and
often occupy abandoned installations despite them
having no right to do so. MagnetoDynamics generally
ignores them however, since they do little harm and
cannot exploit in bulk anything they find. Their best
option – even if it has to be pointed out to them by
means of gun and writ – is to sell the rights to whatever
they find to MagnetoDynamics. At worst irrelevant and
occasionally useful, the Wildcatters explore remote
parts of Fulacin and unearth some of its treasures.

Most of the Wildcatters on Fulacin are drifters or
professional small-team prospectors with no agenda
beyond making a living. Some, however, are Zhodani
assets. These join other Wildcatter groups and mingle
with them. One such group is currently occupying
Prospecting Outpost NN-4A6, better known as Naysix
to its current inhabitants. Out of a population of twelve,
five are Zhodani operatives. The rest are completely
oblivious to the fact they live with spies.

The Wildcatter spies have been doing what they
were sent to do years ago – make ready for whatever
comes their way. They have extended an old mine
shaft and concealed their weaponry, and collect data
on the planet and its conditions just in case it is ever
needed. They also explore, ranging widely in their
air/rafts. They do not know what they are looking
for, just that if they find anything unusual they are to
report it by way of their secure datanet channel and
their commanders will decide what to do with the
information when they finally receive it. If orders come,
they will be ready to act at a moment’s notice.

Meanwhile, other assets were inserted into the
workforce at General Products. Some of them are now
crewmembers aboard the first vessel of the highly secret
Improved Kinunir class of warship. Once it was ready
for trials, their orders came down – steal the ship and
deliver it to the Consulate. Given they held positions
of trust aboard, that was achievable. However, the
operatives knew of another opportunity; an Imperial
noble holding high naval rank was due to hold an illicit
meeting aboard the vessel as part of a corrupt deal to
bypass the naval procurement system. Perhaps he could
also be captured? The intelligence services refer to this
sort of coup as a ‘pinch’ and this could be a big one.

The plan was relatively simple. The operatives aboard
Malishu would wait until their vessel met with that of Sir
Hamex Calston over Fulacin. With the assistance of the
operatives on-planet they would pinch both the ship and
the noble, then make a dash for the border. With a jump-4 ship at their disposal they could be in Zhodani space in
a little over a month. Risky, perhaps, but the payoff was
potentially worth it. They made the decision to try.

###### AMBUSH AT FULACIN

The Calston Riviera was cruising in low orbit over Fulacin,
not a place a noble’s yacht would normally be but certainly
not illegal. Sir Calston could legitimately refuse to answer
questions about why he was there just at the time the
Improved Kinunir arrived – if those questions were ever
asked at all. Malishu arrived on schedule, having jumped
into the outsystem and headed in to the mainworld under
low power. She had a military transponder which could
be set to not respond to civilian ‘pings’ and thus went
undetected. Using this setting when the ship was not
under naval command was illegal but that was not much
of a concern given her mission.

Malishu was undergoing trials with a small crew
aboard. Insufficient for long-term operations, they
were enough to run the ship for a couple of weeks.
She slipped into orbit undetected, exchanging low-

##### Rescue at Fulacin



emission tightbeam greetings with the yacht. Neither
was supposed to be there, nobody knew they were. As
the ships began to match orbits, a team from Malishu
took the pinnace out to conduct trials, or so they said.
Once clear of the ship, two of the pinnace crew drew
concealed pistols and eliminated their crewmate.
They announced a ‘touch and go’ landing as a test of
systems and dived fast towards the surface.

Meanwhile, the assets among the Wildcatters entered
the mine shaft and retrieved their long-hidden weapons.
Their trusted friends, who had shared dangerous
escapades on the surface of Fulacin for years, were
liquidated in seconds. The pinnace touched down and
they boarded, heading for the parent ship. As they did
so, the yacht’s shuttle conveyed Sir Hamex Calston
aboard the Malishu , where he was greeted with due
ceremony. The boat departed and the shuttle arrived,
armed Zhodani agents gunning down the small craft
technicians and heading for the command spaces.

What happened next was a confused blur; a bodyguard
and loyal crew fighting back as best they could. A chase
through the ship and the activation of security lockouts.
Malishu fired on the yacht’s boat, damaging it badly, but
it docked and the yacht attempted to escape. No distress
signal was transmitted, to protect the reputation of Sir
Hamex. The yacht was already accelerating away with
its crippled boat partway in the docking bay when the
crew realised the owner was not aboard. It was too late,
the Kinunir’s particle guns were coming online. With only
one option left they initiated an emergency jump from
within the extreme-hazard zone. The yacht misjumped
and has not been sighted since.

Malishu’s crew lost control during the fight, causing the
vessel to begin a rapid descent. Some of the Zhodani were
able to save themselves by returning to the pinnace and
attempting to launch. They were more or less successful
but had few options on where to go. As an interim measure
they returned to their settlement to ponder their next move.
Aboard Malishu , a pilot was able to mitigate the crash but
could not prevent it. There are survivors aboard but they
are in grave danger. With no communications there is little
chance of rescue until a surface survey notices the ship
and that cannot happen in the immediate future. There is a
storm approaching, laden with toxic dust, which will further
confuse the situation.

###### REACHING THE WRECK

The general location of the wreck is not hard to find but
sensor data is confused by the atmospheric dust and
a clear picture is not available. The vessel does not

respond to communications, although the Wildcatter
settlement about three kilometres away auto-responds
to transponder pings. It identifies the installation by its
formal designation NN-4A6 and warns of toxic dust
conditions as normal, with an elevated risk due to a
storm in progress. No further communication is possible.

Descending through the dust storm is a little nerve-wracking. Sensor readings are distorted whilst optical-spectrum devices cannot see more than a few metres
at times. A good pilot, proceeding cautiously, should not
get into serious trouble although there are occasional
dips or buffeting side gusts. The Referee should call for
an Average (8+) Pilot check and use the Effect as an
indicator of how rough or smooth the ride was. A very
bad check might make everyone sick but there are no
horrific consequences of failure. Even if the pilot screws
up horribly the automated terrain-avoidance system will
prevent a crash so long as the ship’s drives are functional.

However, given the confused sensor readings caused
by metallic dust the Travellers may get a few surprises.
The terrain-avoidance system may be triggered by a
false reading, suddenly applying full thrust to avoid a
collision with an imaginary mountain. This might inspire
the Travellers to fiddle about with the sensor settings
or to take other measures to smooth out the descent.
The Referee can ask for appropriate skill checks but
messing about with the sensors does produce one odd
effect; suddenly a second set of sensor data overlays
their own. The system tries to make sense of it and avoid
the ground that is suddenly very close indeed. After a
moment the two are resolved and the Travellers get
a few seconds of imagery from the crashed Improved
Kinunir. This is not very useful – dust storms look the
same from most angles – but it may spark their curiosity.

Landing on uneven ground, with debris from the
crash here and there and irregular wind gusts, is a
tricky business. The Travellers may discover a useful
or frustrating – or both – feature of the AutoBridge
system. If the ship thinks it is about to ground too hard
it will automatically abort the landing and gain height.
The problem is, the system is a bit too cautious. An
acceptable landing might be aborted to the annoyance
of everyone aboard. The solution is to fine-tune this
system or turn it off. With it off it is possible to slam the
ship into the ground hard enough to damage it. If the
system is engaged this cannot happen.

The Referee should call for a Difficult (10+) Pilot
check. As currently set, the system will not permit a
landing with less than Effect +3. This can be altered
by trial and error to any value the Travellers want.
Note that even an Effect of -2 or so will not seriously

##### Rescue at Fulacin

damage the ship. It will, however, cause some dings
and perhaps break a few internal objects. Given the
Travellers’ mission, this may be a concern and cause
some acrimony among the crew.

Once on the ground the Travellers will need filter
masks or other breathing equipment to avoid inhaling
the atmospheric taint. Whatever other equipment they
think they will need should be specified before they set
out. Visibility is poor but there is little chance of getting
lost between the ships if the Travellers are sensible.
Even distorted comms signals and sensor readings
will be enough of a guide. Gusts make the dust thicker
and then thinner again, causing the wreck to emerge
suddenly from the gloom.

The downed vessel has the distinctive shape of a Kinunir
cruiser, although with sleeker lines and some variation
in proportions. The vessel appears to have come down
somewhat nose-up, crushing its aft landing gear before
slamming down on its belly. The underside of the hull is
apparently ruptured, and there are cracks here and there
on other surfaces. The pinnace bay doors are open and
badly twisted. It looks like they will have to be cut off
and replaced, and in general there seems to be some
twisting of the ship’s structure. There is still no response
on comms and no sign of the pinnace.

###### GAINING ENTRY

The wreck is lying on slightly sloping terrain, partially
dug in buy the force of the crash. Its nose is buried in
soft ground. It would not be difficult to climb onto the
upper surface from the front of the ship and walk along
the top, although gusty winds might occasionally make
this more hazardous. A Traveller might also climb up
the aft section of the ship to reach the pinnace bay
doors, which are standing wide open.

There are no other easy ways of gaining entry. All
external hatches, valves and airlocks were secured
when the anti-boarding measures were activated.
Resourceful Travellers might manage to get a
maintenance hatch open or expand a crack somewhere
but the most likely point of entry is the pinnace bay. The
Referee should keep in mind that the atmospheric taint
can get into the ship through open hatches and doors.
Contamination will be relatively slight, and the vessel’s
life-support system will try to create overpressure to
blow dust out, but there are risks inherent in taking off
breathing equipment in tainted areas. This is only likely
to be a problem if someone blows a large hole in the
side of the ship.

###### THE MALISHU SITUATION

The vessel’s power plant is online but all systems
are operating at a reduced level. Lights are dim, air
circulation is normal except where overpressure seems
desirable and water/sewage systems are operating
well. There are some cracks or breaks in pipes,
however, so in some areas there may be seepage.
This may or may not be clean water. The ship is in
defensive mode, with its hatches and doors sealed,
but the attackers have over-ridden some of these to
gain access to more of the vessel. The hull creaks and
groans as gusts of wind cause it to distort, especially
when a gust catches the side of the fin.

The ship was operating with a greatly reduced crew for
the purposes of its trials, some of whom were armed
with personal weapons for security. They never really
stood a chance, even with the assistance of the internal
monitors and security systems, but they put up enough
of a fight that most of the hijackers retreated and left
them to their fate. This does mean that the surviving
Zhodani agents have failed in both their missions –
they have seized neither ship nor human target and
may have compromised their cover. They are dedicated
enough to risk their lives but nobody is prepared to die
to fail. It is inevitable they will make another attempt on
the ship once they realise it is reachable.

The crash has thrown every loose object inside the
ship around and smashed many of them. This makes
detective work very difficult. The Travellers may find
bullet-riddled corpses and guns in a chamber but it
will not be clear who shot whom, or if a third party
was responsible. Some rather gross quick and dirty
investigation is possible, perhaps by digging bullets
out of a corpse and matching them to weapons.
Travellers whose computers are set up for forensics
work or can be configured by an inventive operator
may be able to match fingerprints to weapons and tie
the shooter to the target by way of the bullet. Others
will have to take an educated guess.

When the Travellers enter the wreck they have no
idea what to expect. Dim lighting, creaks from the hull
and mysterious bodies might lead them to jump to
conclusions. The Referee should play on their paranoia
if possible, making the investigation of the vessel a
tense and creepy experience rather than a dry search
for something to shoot. The Referee should also
keep in mind that the vessel is not fully fitted out. The
Travellers will eventually notice there are no Imperial
or Navy insignia anywhere, nor is anyone in a uniform.
The overall impression is a spaceworthy but not quite
finished vessel still in the hands of its builders.

##### Rescue at Fulacin



There are a handful of robots aboard. These are
commercially available types and not necessarily the
ones that will be used if the Imperial Navy adopts the
design. Every deck has a general cleaning/maintenance
bot and there are medical-assistance and cargo handling
bots in their specialist areas, plus a couple of ‘carrybots’
that are little more than automated trollies that deliver
heavy or bulky items wherever in the ship they are
needed. These are normally stored in the workshop
storage area but might be encountered anywhere in a
functional, malfunctioning or destroyed condition.

The bots are pieces of machinery, not ‘cute robots’.
They do not talk and do not have any form of
personality, other than a few quirks in the way that they
interpret orders. Orders can be given to a carrybot
or cleaning/maintenance bot by anyone with Crew
access. Medical bots can normally be commanded by
any crewmember subject to override by a specialist or
command level officer. working in that department.

How the Referee uses the bots is subject to dramatic
interpretation. A crippled bot might cause a disturbance,
thrashing about amid the wreckage, and bring nervous
Travellers to investigate. Or it might be lying, powered-down or smashed in the crash, as nothing more than
scenery. Bots cannot be used to gain information
and will not actively help the Travellers, other than by
obeying direct commands, but they may be useful at
times and a distraction at others.

###### INSIDE THE SHIP

The Improved Kinunir takes the general form of a
flattened cone with a prominent dorsal fin. There are
three decks whose size varies due to the hull form.
The space between the inhabited decks is generally
taken up with fuel tanks and other liquid storage such
as lubricants, drinking water and other stores that
can be fitted into oddly shaped spaces. The hull is
internally partitioned by bulkheads which form part of
the ship’s structure.

Bulkheads are extremely difficult to breach and would
require specialist cutting equipment or a great deal
of energy from a laser or plasma weapon to burn a
hole through. Bulkheads are penetrated by iris valves,
which are almost as resilient as the bulkhead when
locked. In the event of an emergency such as a hull
breach or security alert, iris valves close automatically
and require special authorisation to open. This
normally rests with the ship’s officers or someone
they designate. For damage-control purposes there
are overrides on the bridge and in the drive room to
allow a coordinating officer to grant emergency parties
access to other parts of the ship.

Some bulkheads do not have iris valves but are
penetrated by manually operated hatches instead.
These are operated by the traditional wheel, which
withdraws the locking pins from the bulkhead. Hatches
are not remotely controlled and cannot be; they can
however be jammed by placing an obstruction through
the open/close wheel. Most internal walls are lighter
partitions, which can be smashed through with some
effort. Partitions are penetrated by light doors, and
will hold pressure only for a short time before failing.
Internal doors can be kicked off their mountings by a
determined person but they are tough and dismounting
or breaching one will require significant effort.

Deck floors are also bulkheads, with a narrow (typically
80 centimetres) equipment space directly below each.
This contains pipes, ducts, conduits and wiring as well
as internal sensors, floor grav plates and the like. Under
it is a ceiling for the deck below, which is the equivalent
of a partition. Floor grav plates provide a standard 1G
unless controlled to do something different from the
bridge. The plates are designed to provide a measure of
inertial compensation but cannot change their field fast
enough to entirely negate the effects of acceleration or
deceleration. They might mitigate a crash a little but only
a little. The plates’ maximum output is about 2.4G for a
very short time, i.e. to compensate for a rapid change of
velocity. Sustained output is in the 0-1.2G range.

##### Rescue at Fulacin

###### INTERNAL SECURITY

The outer hull of the Improved Kinunir is penetrated at
various points by airlocks and other access points. It
might be possible to cut a path into the ship although
the hull but this does risk entering a liquid-hydrogen
fuel tank, sewage processing tank or other hazardous/
noxious area. The ship’s outer hull is armoured against
warship weapons, so cutting a path in would take some
time even with the right equipment.

Most entry points are locked unless the ship’s officers
or its automatic systems unlock them. It would not
normally be possible to accidentally hit the cargo ramp
button and vent the lower deck to space, for example.
Nor could unauthorised personnel simply walk up and
open an airlock while the ship is grounded. Automatic
security systems are in place, which will allow access
to the outer entry points and key areas of the ship only
to certain personnel. The ship’s systems grant access
based on a keycard system.

The card does not normally require to be presented,
except at certain secure areas. Most commonly it
operates on a transponder basis, which also allows
personnel to be tracked. Some functions, such as
jump initiation and missile launch, do require the card
to be placed in a slot but in most cases doors and
iris valves will open as an authorised crewmember
approaches them unless the ship is on alert or a
privacy lock has been initiated.

Access using any given card can be amended by the
ship’s captain or executive officer, or granted from the
bridge on a temporary basis by any officer. Thus the
captain can amend a crewmember’s card to give access
to a weapons turret or arms locker on a permanent or
temporary basis, or any officer on the bridge can instruct
the door to unlock so that an otherwise unauthorised
crewmember can clean the missile launchers.

COMMAND CARDS are issued to the captain,
executive officer and chief engineer. They give access
to all areas and functions.
OFFICER CARDS are issued to all officers. They give
access to all areas necessary for an officer’s duties.
For example, marine officers would have access to
weapons lockers but not engineering spaces.
SPECIALIST CARDS give access to normal crew
spaces plus a specialist duty area. For example,
gunners have turret access; marine weapons
technicians have arms-locker access.
CREW CARDS give access to normal crew spaces
such as the galley and whatever area the crewmember
normally works in. For example, engineering technicians
have access to the drive rooms but not weapons turrets.

Groundside access is normally via the ship’s loading
ramps, or by lowering the whole cargo platform to the
ground, or by flying a grav vehicle into the vehicle bay on
A deck. In space, access is normally via the small craft
bay at the aft of the ship. There is a personnel airlock on
A deck for EVA (extra-vehicular activity, in other words
operations outside the ship) whilst the ship is in space.

Since this vessel is still in the hands of its builders,
this system has been only partially implemented.
The commander, first officer and chief engineer had
Command level keycards and all other personnel were
issued Crew cards. Blank keycards were stored in the
security office for issue as necessary. This means that
some functions can only be accessed using one of the
Command cards. Two of the three are still aboard.

###### Q DECK

The dorsal fin and associated components are collectively
referred to as Q Deck, although this is not a ‘deck’ in the
proper sense. Personnel spaces are cramped, just big
enough to give access to essential systems and storage
lockers. The latter contain items that are not likely to be
used very often if at all. Q Deck is sometimes referred to
as ‘the attic’ and it is inevitably the most junior personnel
who are sent up there to get something.

The majority of the ship’s armament is mounted along
the base of the dorsal fin. There are four laser turrets
each side, with a pair of particle accelerator barbettes
at the front corners. This permits both accelerators
to bear on a target in front of the ship or one to each
side. These weapons cannot bear aft and are blocked
by the ship’s structure from firing in a ‘downward’
direction. The ship can quickly pitch or roll to bring
them to bear, however. Laser weapons are likewise
restricted to one side of the ship or the other, and
‘upward’ relative to the ship’s main axis.

These turrets can be accessed from a crawlway
running through the base of the fin and can be
manually operated from within the turret. However, they
are almost always remotely operated and normally
accessed only for inspection and maintenance. The
missile armament, on the other hand, requires crew
in attendance. Two turrets are mounted, one on the
aft tip of the lower hull, with a magazine and missile
preparation area close by. These turrets can also be
remotely operated but standard practice is to have
a gunner physically in the turret and a technician
overseeing the automated loading mechanism.

This whole area is pretty basic even in a fitted-out
and operational ship. Only the EVA room would have
extensive facilities as vacc suits and rescue equipment

need servicing. In the present situation the chamber
is more or less bare other than a small emergency
locker. It is possible that one or more of the Zhodani
agents will use the crawlway to move fore and aft whilst
concealed, getting behind the Travellers or out of an
area that would seem suspicious.

###### A DECK

A Deck is the narrowest of the main decks. It forms
the base of the dorsal fin but is considerably wider.
A Deck is mostly concerned with flight and command
operations. An access shaft at the fore end of the
dorsal fin runs down to the lower decks through A deck.
The aft access shaft runs up to the fin and the EVA
room. There are also inter-deck access hatches on the
rear flanks of this deck, leading down to B deck. Most
crew do not require access to A deck, which makes it
relatively easy to keep the command area secure.

Despite the impact with the ground, the ship is
reasonably intact although fittings have sprung loose
and small objects are scattered all over the floor.
Fitting-out was incomplete so most areas are in a
liveable-at-best condition and some cabins are just
shells. Much of the equipment that would be aboard
a functional vessel – tools, emergency softsuits,
spares and small luxuries – are entirely absent or
present in a minimal quantity. It is probable that this
vessel would not pass a standard spaceworthiness
inspection for lack of many minor but required items.
However, General Products passed their own vessel as
spaceworthy and its condition – before the incident –
was good enough for trials with a skilled crew.

**A DECK FORWARD**
Everything forward of the access/security chamber is
secured both electronically and physically. Obtaining
a command level keycard grants access. Once the
Travellers have done so they can view security footage
and see the incident play out from the return of the
pinnace and elimination of the support team to the
attempt to seize Sir Hamex and the subsequent fight
and crash. After that footage is partial and patchy. The

Travellers will be able to download or delete the footage
if they have access. They can also gain access to the
ship’s logs but they say nothing about the meeting, just
references to a trials cruise before final fitting-out.

There are two bodies on the bridge, both dressed in
General Products-issue working coveralls. The pilot is
strapped into her seat and appears to have suffered
a gunshot wound to the abdomen before taking her
station. The other crewmember is beside the captain’s
chair but does not have a command-level access card.
He appears to have triggered the emergency lockdown
but succumbed to injuries taken in the crash. Both
legs and his pelvis are broken, with no sign he was the
victim of deliberate violence.

The crew were operating on a low-security setting
before the attack, with all personnel able to access all
systems. This might have been useful with a small crew
undertaking trials but it did not account for treachery.
Once triggered, the security system should have
restricted use of command-level cards to designated
carriers but this was one of the disabled features. Thus,
the Travellers will be able to use any card they find. If
they are really stuck and cannot find one to get access
to this area, the Referee may decide that additional
command level cards had been created and perhaps
been left lying around somewhere.

Within the ship’s office is an electronically locked safe
which responds to command level access. There is
little inside except the ship’s fund of ‘contingency cash’.
This amounts to Cr250000 in high-denomination Credit
plaques and an assortment of smaller denominations
totalling Cr32000 or so. The cash is useable by anyone
but has been electronically marked and could be
traced by General Products. The armoury is more or
less empty. The crew had a few pistols and a couple
of shotguns aboard. Some of these, along with some
ammunition and spare magazines, may still be present.
There are no heavier weapons.

A DECK AFT


Only the forward access valve in the security chamber
requires command level. Up, down or aft requires
only Crew level access. What would eventually be the
wardroom for officers is a bare shell but all the cabins
are at least usable. There are few personal effects
aboard as the crew were essentially ‘at work’ for the
duration of the test cruise rather than living aboard
in the usual sense. There is a body in this area; a
crewmember caught unprepared and unarmed, riddled
with pistol bullets and left for dead.

##### DECK B

###### B DECK

B Deck is the uppermost of the main decks and
primarily contains crew accommodation forward, with
the upper part of the pinnace bay aft. All crewmembers
require access to this deck, so ‘Crew’ level access is
adequate for all access points other than the upward
shaft to A Deck.

4. Galley and Mess Hall
5. Crew Accommodation Aft Block
6. Pinnace Bay Upper
7. Nuclear Dampers
8. Access Shafts Down to C Deck

**B DECK FORWARD**
The whole forward section of B deck is unsecured.
Doors will open automatically if functional, although
some are warped and may need to be ‘assisted’
by a boot or other heavy implement. The crew
accommodation area is barely fitted out but some
cabins were in use. The galley is stocked for a month,
assuming a crew of 20, with a few luxuries clearly
intended for celebration of milestones in the cruise.
Three of the crew tried to flee into this area and were
shot through doors or cornered and executed. If the
Travellers are able to investigate there are powder
burns indicating point-blank execution even on those
who were already critically wounded.

**B DECK AFT**
Most of B deck should require crew level access, but
this has been disabled. The vessel’s nuclear damping
system is intact, giving access to C deck below by way
of the associated shafts. The pinnace bay is where the
Travellers are most likely to enter the ship. They will
probably come in through the aft doors at C deck level
but movement into the rest of the ship requires getting
up to B deck level and using the gantry that runs right
around the pinnace berth at that level.

The gantry leads into a platform from where the rest
of the ship can be accessed. There are two bodies
here; unarmed personnel in the working coveralls
of General Products employees. These were the
technicians assigned to look after the pinnace, who
naturally came to greet the crew when they arrived.
The techs had just long enough to wonder why a
bunch of planetsiders were exiting the shuttle before
they were shot. Their Crew level keycards are still on

their bodies. Travellers may note that both have one
or more gunshot wounds to the head and that overkill
has occurred. In fact some of the boarders put an
extra round into their victims as they passed.

There is further evidence of violence in the mess hall,
although this was more of a fight. Sir Hamex and his
two bodyguards were talking to the ship’s captain
and some of his crew when they heard gunshots.
Fellow crewmembers would have hesitated to shoot
when a comrade came into the chamber but the
bodyguards did not. They opened fire with light, compact
submachineguns and hit some of the attackers. Two
were killed in the exchange along with some of the crew
but they bought time for the captain and Sir Hamex, both
wounded, to escape. They retreated forward and used
the between-decks access panels to flee to C deck. A
couple of other crewmembers got the pilot to the bridge
where they activated the security lockouts. They grabbed
guns from the armoury and tried to find other survivors.
From this point on there were multiple armed people
hunting one another throughout the ship.

###### C DECK

C deck is the widest of the main decks. It contains
the lower half of the pinnace bay and the vessel’s
engineering spaces as well as the marine barracks.
One peculiarity of the class is that the engineering
spaces are split and are located on opposite sides
of the pinnace bay which makes it difficult to pass
quickly from one to the other. Both engineering areas
are accessible from the decks above and below, using
shafts sealed at either end by iris valves.

Typically only engineering crew and marines, as well
as the missile technicians and gunners, require access
to this deck. Normally Specialist level access would
be granted but since this vessel has not yet been
commissioned Crew access is sufficient for most areas.

##### DECK C AND D

**C DECK FORWARD**
The forward part of C deck is unsecured. The marine
armoury and barracks were incomplete and have been
trashed by impact with the ground. There is some
distortion of the deck and bulkheads as well. This area
was cursorily searched by the hijackers, who then
moved on. They noted that someone had snatched
some basic medical supplies but failed to notice the
ship’s captain, whose unconscious body was hidden
in the lower deck access tunnel. He died there, his
keycard still on his person.

**C DECK AFT**
The engineering spaces normally need Specialist
or higher access but this has been over-ridden
using the first officer’s keycard. Doors must still be
manually activated. Warned by other crewmembers,
the ship’s engineer was able to escape through
the access shafts to D deck. She was still trying to
find a place to hide or a way to fight back when the
ship impacted, critically injuring her. Her body lies
somewhere between the engineering spaces and D
deck with her card on her person.

Sir Hamex Calston is strapped into the portside
gunner’s chair. He was brought here, severely
wounded, by his surviving bodyguard after evading
the hijackers by way of D deck. He has two gunshot
wounds which have received cursory treatment and is
in a critical condition.

###### D DECK

D Deck is mostly given over to stowage and cargo,
although some of this space can be repurposed.
Cargo is loaded by way of a ramp that can be dropped
between the forward landing feet, enabling the forward
cargo area to act as a vehicle garage. The fuel scoops
can be accessed by way of hatches at the sides of
the forward cargo area. Crew-level access is all that is
normally required for this deck.

1. Forward Cargo Area
2. Fuel Scoop Machinery
3. Fuel Scoop Machinery
4. Workshop and Stowage
5. Access shaft to C Deck
6. Cargo/Configurable Space

**D DECK FORWARD**
Routine access to the ship, other than for officers and
important visitors, was by way of the forward cargo ramp.
It is now buckled and distorted. There are a few boxes of
mission supplies in this area but it is otherwise empty.

D DECK AFT


The aft part of this deck is less damaged than the
forward end and served as a refuge for those who
managed to escape the initial surprise attack. The
hijackers did attempt to breach this area but came under
submachinegun fire from the surviving bodyguard. They
decided to retreat to the pinnace at this point as the ship
was clearly descending out of control. The bodyguard
managed to get his charge back up to C deck and
concealed him in the missile stowage area whilst he
hunted down any surviving hijackers.

###### PLAYING OUT THE ADVENTURE

Most of the crew and the hijackers were killed or
seriously injured in the fight and the crash. Some of the
Zhodani agents escaped in the pinnace and will return
now the wreck is on the ground. As the Travellers
search the ship they will find evidence of a fight and
may encounter survivors. How these react depends
on circumstances. The crew do not know why they
were attacked, and having been betrayed by comrades
they had known for months or years they will be wary
and defensive. Zhodani survivors may approach the
Travellers as if they are glad to be rescued, or may
observe and seek an opportunity for an ambush.
Surviving crewmembers may not know which of the
others are traitors but the Zhodani agents are all aware
of one another’s true allegiance.

The Referee should keep in mind that the ship still
has power but is under emergency/combat protocols
so access to some parts is restricted to those with
clearance. Gaining keycards or bypassing the ship’s
security will give access to secure areas. There is also
light, air recycling and life support in the ship. It would
be possible to take a hot shower or cook a meal, and
in some parts of the ship there are no real signs that
anything has happened. Others are, in the parlance of
the spacefaring community, ‘comprehensively trashed’.

The adventure should play out as a tense and perhaps
creepy search of the ship, with the Travellers piecing
together what has happened along the way. They may
have to reassure or negotiate with survivors and will
need to find one of the Command level keycards to
get access to the bridge. Once they have done that
they can set up access for themselves or disable
the security lockdown in a similar manner to how
they would manage security aboard their own ship.
Eventually they will find Sir Hamex Calston and may
realise there is something afoot here.

##### Rescue at Fulacin



The Travellers may or may not be attacked by
Zhodani survivors during the investigation stage of
the adventure. If that happens, it is best played out
as a series of fleeting encounters, not all of them
violent and perhaps not all with enemies. Someone
runs past the end of a corridor and scrambles into
a maintenance hatch leading into the between-deck
tunnels. Was that the same person who fired at the
Travellers across the pinnace bay or someone else?
The Travellers might encounter traps, or walk right
past what seems to be another fatality but is in fact
a Zhodani agent playing possum. The Zhodani are
dedicated enough to risk an attack on a group that has
‘rescued’ one of their number, accepting that hitting a
fellow agent is a necessary hazard.

Eventually, the pinnace returns. After escaping, the
Zhodani agents went back to their base to decide what
to do and agreed to make another attempt on the ship.
They will land beside the wreck and enter, intending
to eliminate anyone inside and capture Sir Hamex if
he is still alive. They may pose as a rescue party. The
Travellers’ ship will be bypassed for the time being
but the agents view it as their ticket out of the system
so will plan to capture some of the Travellers in order
to force them to hand over the ship. If they can, the
agents will try to dupe the Travellers into cooperating
with them until they are taken aboard the prototype.
The traitors include the ship’s first officer, who still has
her Command level access card.

The adventure will probably climax with a fight between
the Travellers and the Zhodani agents aboard the wreck
or perhaps their own ship. The Travellers can expect
no mercy and will be kept alive only as long as they are
compliant and useful. No Zhodani agent will confess to
their real identity and there is nothing to indicate their
true allegiance either on their person or at their camp.
The Travellers may leave Fulacin without knowing who
brought down the ship or why. Subsequent events may
give them a strong clue, however.

###### OPPOSITION AND ALLIES

There are some survivors aboard the wreck and the
Zhodani agents will return at some point. Exactly how
many survivors or opponents there are is up to the
Referee but it is advisable to keep numbers small to
avoid having to keep track of multiple people.

CREWMEMBERS


Legitimate crewmembers will be confused, frightened
and angry at the betrayal of their trust. They will
try to hide or avoid anyone they do not know and
will generally be seeking to get into the bridge area
and send a distress signal. This requires Command
level access, which means finding the captain or the
engineer’s body. Some crewmembers may know where
they are but be too afraid or simply unable to get there.
They will be grudging or ineffectual allies for the most
part, and quite probably know less than the Travellers
about what happened and why.

was attacked in some backwater, say the Dinom system,
by members of a rebellion going on there? The Travellers
swooped in with their excellent ship and bravely rescued
Sir Hamex. Nobody knows anything about a missing
General Products ship and everyone benefits!

He can be bargained into paying large amounts of money
for silence but his offer is probably a better one. Extorting
money will make him an Enemy of the Travellers, whilst
working with him could produce great results later
and does not antagonise him. He may be useful if the
Travellers need information and he knows some very
rich people who respect discretion and resourcefulness.
Alternatively, the Travellers might just turn him over to the
authorities and watch him try to explain why he was in the
Fulacin system at all. That might lead to them having to
answer some difficult questions, however.

COMMODORE SIR HAMEX CALSTON


Sir Hamex Calston is slightly overweight and physically
lazy by inclination, although his mind moves at an
alarming pace. He comes from an ‘old navy’ family of
minor nobility and followed a typical career path for
such people. Graduating naval academy he served for
a time aboard cruisers and capital ships before moving
into a staff role at various naval bases. Sir Hamex has
not been part of a warship crew since his sublieutenant
days, although none can deny the work he does is
important to the navy.

From administration of the supply chain, Sir Hamex
progressed into starship and component procurement,
a role that required close liaison with manufacturers
and designers. He has been one of the senior officers
dealing with procurement for the Lanth and Rhylanor
fleets for some years now and is generally very
effective. However, there is a lot of money involved in
what he does and helping someone important make
money is the key to greater prestige as a noble. At
some point in the past couple of years Sir Hamex
became more concerned about his noble status than
his duty to the Imperial Navy.

There are some complex and cross-cutting agendas
among the nobility of the Spinward Marches and
some powerful people want the Improved Kinunir
adopted for service. Their reasons vary – some have
invested in the project, others have a deeper agenda.
Better security along the frontiers is beneficial to
trade but it also makes the people who made it
happen look good... and it might help persuade
the sector commander to move some battleships to
deployments they want.

###### SIR HAMEX CALSTON

Sir Hamex Calston is badly hurt, having taken two
gunshots and ridden through a starship crash with
nothing but a padded seat to protect him. He is badly
frightened but is also a career naval officer and an
Imperial noble. He knows how to put on a brave face.
He is of course suspicious of his rescuers and will not
divulge sensitive information but may have to make a
deal to get himself out of the present situation.

The meeting with General Products was illegal, illicit
and fairly typical of how business is done in certain
quarters. Naval procurement is big money and those
who get results for the right clients are assured of
additional power and prestige. Sir Hamex Calston is
willing to saddle the navy with an inferior ship it does
not want if that furthers his own career and his family’s
fortune. However, he is corrupt rather than traitorous.

If the Travellers can present Sir Hamex with a way out
of the situation he will be in their debt and could be
a very useful contact in the future. If he understands
their mission he will offer to fast-track the Travellers to
a meeting with the subsector admirals for Lanth and
Rhylanor, which would be an excellent opportunity to
present their ship. RVSC never dreamed this would
be possible, so the Travellers could greatly exceed
expectations if they are willing to play along.

Sir Hamex’ idea is that the Travellers ‘rescued’ him from
a hijack attempt on his yacht. If the vessel turns up he will
deal with any conflicting stories. It would be best not to
be caught in the vicinity of the present incident since he
was not supposed to be there at all but what if the yacht

##### Rescue at Fulacin



Sir Hamex is part of a group of nobles who support
the Duchess of Mora in her bid to become sector
duke. He hopes to receive a barony when he leaves
naval service and to that end is pushing her agenda.
However, he is not disloyal. He believes, or has
convinced himself, that the Improved Kinunir really is
the ship the subsector fleets need and feels no shame
about receiving favours and thinly disguised bribed in
return for backing it.

The meeting with the General Products crew at
Fulacin was supposed to finalise Sir Hamex’ backing
for the vessel with a semi-plausible story about being
impressed by one of these excellent ships at a chance
encounter. He now needs to find an explanation for
why he was aboard the vessel when it was hijacked.
It will be easy enough to distance himself from the
incident providing he can get far enough away and
perhaps produce some witnesses to the ‘attack’ on his
yacht somewhere else.

Sir Hamex is worried about the consequences for
himself rather than the Kinunir crew or the navy in
general but after a while he begins to see a way
through all of this. If the Travellers will go along with his
plan he gets himself out of the investigation and will be
able to cite the fact that even an Imperial Knight cannot
travel in safety as a reason why the subsector fleets
should adopt the Improved Kinunir as soon as possible.

###### AFTERMATH

The Travellers are sort of in possession of a vessel
owned by General Products. ‘Sort of’ refers to the
fact that it is useless except as a source of spares
and scrap in its present condition and since there
were survivors aboard the Travellers do not have
salvage rights. The vessel legally still belongs to
General Products. They are also in contact with Sir
Hamex Calston or his bodyguard. He is not just an
Imperial noble; he is an important figure in warship
procurement for the local subsector fleets. Discovery
of his off-books meeting with the General Products
crew could be problematic.

There are multiple ways all of this can play out, but
some matters are more pressing than others. Fulacin
has a Class A starport and a system defence squadron.
The incident went unnoticed at first due to the fact both
ships involved were trying to remain undetected and
the storm prevented the crash from being immediately
noticed. The yacht did not transmit a distress call as its
crew knew it needed to jump immediately in order to
avoid being blasted to atoms. Perhaps the vessel or its
wreckage will turn up somewhere else, which will raise
questions. In the meantime, as the storm clears the
wreck will be sighted at some point. What appears to
be a downed navy ship will certainly attract attention.

Rescue ships will be sent almost immediately and if
the Travellers’ ship is sighted near the wreck it will be
intercepted by the system defence flotilla and any naval
ships that happen to be in-system. Attempting to flee
will result in the Travellers being fired upon by the navy;
they are unlikely to survive. If they somehow evade
interception or destruction their vessel will be flagged
as a possible hostile and they face the same response
in all Imperial star systems the news has reached.

In this event, the mission is scuppered. The
authorities do not immediately know who was on
board but they will find out quickly enough. The
RVSC personnel aboard will want to surrender to
the authorities and actually have the means to force
that to happen. The Travellers will face protest and

possible resistance if they decide to flee anyway and
if they do their best option would be to run for the
border. They might find safe haven in the Federation
of Arden. This means they are outlaws known to
have been involved in the loss of a megacorporate
ship which was of interest to the Imperial Navy. Their
futures could become quite interesting...

If the Travellers wait for or surrender to the
authorities they will be disarmed and detained, and
questioned at great length. However, this is more
about determining facts than finding something for
the Travellers to be guilty of. So long as their stories
match each other and the security camera footage
available they will, more than likely, be determined to
have done the right thing. They detected a crashed
ship and tried to assist despite the storm; there is
nothing wrong with that. They do not seem to have
any connection to the hijackers and fought against
them... again, these are worthy actions.

There are a couple of ticklish subjects to deal with,
however. How did the Travellers detect the crash when
nobody else did? Examination of their sensor data is as
confusing to the local investigators as to the Travellers
themselves. If they can give a plausible answer the
matter will not be pursued further. The big questions
are about who the hijackers were and why Sir Hamex
was present. ‘We don’t know’ is a perfectly plausible
answer that fits the known facts, so despite rigorous
questioning the Travellers do not have much to fear.
They will not be able to keep anything taken from the
wreck, however, as it belongs to General Products.

The Travellers can avoid all these complications by
leaving the crash site under cover of the storm. They
have a few hours before the wreck becomes visible
from orbit; long enough to search the ship and perhaps
remove a few pieces of plunder before quietly leaving
the system. If they do so they will leave behind a
mystery providing they get rid of the wreck’s security
footage and sensor records. If not, the Imperial
authorities will want to question them and/or the
owners of the prototype and will detain the Travellers
at some point in the future if they can. This looks more
suspicious than if the Travellers just cooperated but
ultimately they can be shown to have done the right
thing and are unlikely to be charged with any offence.

The wreck will be secured as far as possible and a
team from General Products will come to remove
everything they can. After this, the most likely fate is
for the wreck to be broken up by a commercial salvage
team. If the Travellers visit the Wildcatter settlement
they will find evidence of long-term occupation and
hastily covered-up indications of violence such as bullet
impacts in the walls. All bodies, bloodstains and the like
have been removed.

Personal effects are still present, although data-storage
devices were destroyed or removed. If the Travellers
take a good look around they will notice several
printouts of maps showing parts of Fulacin. There are
courses and timings noted on them which correspond
to wide-ranging flights in an air/raft. This is odd for
prospectors, who would more commonly be thorough
in exploring a small region then moving their base of
operations. It is more in keeping with exploration.

A nearby mine shaft has recently collapsed, and if
excavated would be found to contain the bdies of
several Wildcatters along with everything missing
from the settlement other than a few personnel and
their weapons. Explosives were used to collapse the
shaft. It will be obvious that this was an organised
group, but there are no indications about their
allegiance or ultimate purpose.

The Travellers may be left with more questions than
answers but there are a few solid facts to work on. A
noble and naval officer met with a General Products
team in a manner that suggests this was not an official
encounter. From this it may be possible to infer that
General Products is trying to rig the procurement
process to get ships adopted by the local subsector
fleets, perhaps as part of a wider plan to push for
adoption Imperium-wide.

The attack is more of a mystery. It seems to have been
an inside job but it is not clear whether the ship or the
noble was the target. The Travellers will have to ponder
this one as there is no clear and obvious answer. What
they do know is that someone had agents on Fulacin
for a long time. What might they have been waiting for?
If the Travellers know the Wildcatters were undertaking
long exploration flights they might wonder if they were
looking for something. There is no indication of what
that might be.

##### Rescue at Fulacin

The Travellers have a meeting scheduled at Dinom,
eight parsecs from Fulacin. By refuelling at K’Kirka they
could get there in a little over two weeks. They may
also have Sir Hamex aboard and if so Dinom would
be a good place to ‘rescue’ him. The meeting was set
up months ago and is not scheduled for a particular
place and time. Instead, the Travellers’ contact knows
a delegation is on its way and will arrange a meeting as
soon as possible after the Travellers arrive.

The Travellers are thus not bound to a schedule and
could wend their way slowly along the Spinward Main
if they chose. They will notice a few things during their
voyage, even if they move as quickly as they can.
Peculiarities with the Autocrew system will be making
themselves felt by this point, although serious trouble
will not have occurred. The Travellers may also notice
the odd sensor glitch, as if the system was picking up
more data than it should or was receiving a conflicting
data feed. Going back over recorded signals will not
reveal any external source for this additional data.

The Travellers may also take note of the traffic along
the main. Vessels large and small ply the main,
mostly turning coreward at Dinom towards Regina
and perhaps Efate. A smaller proportion of vessels
proceeds towards Arden, with few indeed making
the whole run into Zhodani space to turn around at
Sansibar. The vast majority of vessels on the Spinward
Main are Imperial registered but there are some that
use Arden as a flag of convenience or are actually
based there. Zhodani vessels are relatively rare and
those that are sighted on the Spinward Main are
usually capable of more than jump-1. Chugging along
the spacelanes is the cheapest way to move goods but
vessels trading in the space of another great power
tend to be carrying high-value items and will benefit
from getting them to market quickly.

Some worlds on the main have quite poor starports.
A quick glance at the starcharts suggests that jump-1
vessels that cannot land on a planetary surface will not
be able to pass Vriebefger, Pirema, Rech or Dinom.
This is in fact not the case. The starport code refers to
the quality of the mainworld starport but the economic

# T HE SPINWARD MAIN

benefits of a jump-1 main are such that alternative
fuelling installations were set up with Imperial funding.
These are rather basic, consisting of old navy tankers
kept topped up by shuttles skimming the system’s
gas giants. With only minimal facilities these are not
starports but they are vital to the regional economy.

One unintended consequence of setting up these
fuelling stations was to further stunt the growth of the
mainworld economy. With no need to visit the port,
most ships simply refuel and move on. The mainworld
therefore receives less trade and cannot make money
from services at the port. Some populations feel this
is unfair but since they never had the money to build
a ‘proper’ starport they could not have gained these
benefits. There have been various initiatives aimed at
upgrading the poorest ports on the main but thus far it
has been more cost-effective to provide fuel and let the
mainworld look to its own affairs.

If the Travellers want to visit worlds along the way
they can of course do so. All manner of side trips and
adventures are possible but there is only one scripted
encounter. This can be inserted at any suitable point.

###### SENSOR GLITCH

As the Travellers are passing through one of the
systems on their route, their sensors pick up a faint
set of emissions. These are off the main inbound
and outbound jump-to-port lanes and not likely to be
a vessel headed for another planet. Travellers with
naval experience will know that this is the sort of place
where navy warships quietly lurk – and so do raiders.
Sometimes the navy wants its ships to be seen, acting
as a deterrent and reassuring trade ships. On other
occasions it may be beneficial to hide and see how
the traffic behaves when it seems like there is no
enforcement going on.

There are various reasons why a warship might be
behaving this way. It is a routine pirate-trap technique,
which some civilians object to as they feel they are
being used as bait. If this is the case, there is probably
no special alert in progress. However, sometimes a

route might be covertly observed for a specific reason.
A spate of pirate attacks is the likely cause, or the
suspicion that a dangerous criminal might be trying to
move through that system.

What is peculiar about this detection is that although
this vessel is producing minimal emissions and does
not respond to transponder pings, the Travellers’
sensors are producing a lot of data from somewhere.
This resolves itself into a familiar looking table after a
few moments.

VESSEL TYPE: Kinunir-class 100% Confidence.
VESSEL IDENTITY: Enki Kalamma.
LOCATION: Coordinates Available.
CONDITION: Operational, observing EMCON status.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: Weapons unpowered.
ANALYSIS: Vessel has adopted covert observation
status. No combat alert in progress.

The information disappears after a moment and
cannot be retrieved, leaving the Travellers with
questions. They may wonder how their sensor system
could tell so much about a military vessel which
has not even revealed its presence. The system
has even attempted to identify the ship from its
emissions. Whilst all vessels have unique emissions
the differences between well-maintained ships of the
same class are tiny. It is not clear how the Travellers’
ship has produced this information. Since Autocrew
has begun glitching, the Travellers might wonder if
this is connected. They are not wrong; problems with
Autocrew have interfered with the naval intelligence
package aboard their ship. However, they will not find
any sign of it even if they suspect the presence of
some additional electronic system.

It would be unwise to acknowledge the presence of
the warship. It is operating under Emission Control (EMCON) status and should not be detectable to
passing civilian vessels. Acknowledging the vessel
demonstrates the Travellers have exceptionally
good sensors and the skill to use them, which will
pique the interest of the patrol ship. The Travellers’
vessel will be stopped and searched, and they will
be subject to questioning about how they detected
the Kinunir and their business in the area. This could
go awry but if the Travellers are not foolish and have
not left evidence of criminality lying around they will
eventually be cleared to proceed.

##### The spinward Main

The Dinom system is named for its primary, a very hot,
bright giant star which long ago destroyed most of its
planetary system. All that remained was a gas giant
and its satellites, which were perturbed out of their
orbits. All but one were ejected from the system or
swallowed by the star. The survivor, now named Dinom
as the de facto mainworld of the system, was captured
at the gas giant’s trailing Trojan point.

Dinom has a 1,600-year orbital period. At present its
north pole is pointed more or less directly at the star,
creating a situation whereby one face of the planet
is permanently ‘bright’ and the other permanently
‘cold’. Precession will gradually alter this but for
the next couple of centuries the faces will endure
extreme opposite conditions. The world’s atmosphere
of methane and carbon dioxide is frozen on the cold
face and was boiled away into space on the bright
face. The only permanent habitation is in the twilight
zone between the two.

It was never a good prospect for colonisation and for
many years the only presence in the system was a
refuelling station orbiting the gas giant. The discovery
of rich mineral resources resulted in the creation of
three ‘corp towns’ named Rhylan, Medianne and
Napan. These attracted some secondary settlement
as new arrivals opened businesses to cater to the
miners and ore processing workers. The population has
reached 230,000 and is unlikely to grow much more.

Dinom does not really have a planetary government
as such. Each of the cities is run by a board of
directors who answer to the shareholders of the mining
and ore processing companies. Workers and non-shareholders receive little representation at any level,
creating an effective oligarchy. Offworld affairs are
the responsibility of the World Board, which meets in
Rhylan. Theoretically responsible for system security
and related matters, the board is primarily concerned
with ensuring offworld events do not impact the
shareholders’ profits.

# D INOM

The situation on Dinom naturally produces some
resentment, which has traditionally been appeased
with better salaries or slight improvements in working
conditions. However, in recent months unrest has
been increasing. Sabotage and threats of violence
were met with a crackdown using offworld security
personnel but rather than suppressing the unrest
this measure has triggered an open revolt. By no
means all the workers of Dinom are involved but a
great many are engaging in passive resistance, civil
disobedience, go-slows or strikes. A smaller number
are in open rebellion and have in some cases taken
control of outlying installations or sectors of the
cities. The World Board of Dinom is downplaying
the situation to its own people and outsiders alike...
putting a bright face on things, if you will.

# T HE BRIGHT FACE

Even far from the system’s primary, things are hot
and bright. The Travellers’ sensors are subject to
interference as soon as they arrive in the Dinom
system. Most interstellar traffic bypasses the
mainworld, refuelling at a station orbiting the gas giant
before leaving as quickly as possible. The majority
of ships approaching the mainworld are freighters
on contract to pick up shipments of refined ore for
transportation to industrial worlds. Those arriving
normally carry bulk foods for the masses and luxuries
for the elite. Speculative trade in a port like this is
usually unprofitable but there will always be the odd
trader willing to chance it. Otherwise, all the mainworld
port would ever see is shuttles from orbiting freighters.

There is no traffic in orbit or close to Dinom when
the Travellers arrive and interference from the star
imposes DM-1 on sensor and communications tasks.
Occasionally there are sensor ghosts or erroneous
data which might make the Travellers think their
sensor system is acting up again. Heading in towards
Dinom should be uneventful despite this, although the
automated traffic control system carries an advisory
that there is unrest on-planet and that personnel should
be cautious outside the landing area.

The three cities of Dinom all lie on the equator, in
the twilight zone. They are connected by a bright
ribbon which any data terminal can tell the Travellers
is an enclosed monorail system. It was intended
to circumnavigate the planet, although the project
ran into difficulties and is unfinished. The cities
themselves are blocky and set low, with complexes
of sealed buildings linked by transitways. A ring
of ore processing works and vehicle maintenance
facilities surrounds each and as the Travellers
approach they will see vehicles – ATVs and heavy
load carriers for the most part – moving between the
city and its industrial installations. Other vehicles are
far out from the cities, headed for small installations
or engaged in prospecting work for the most part.

The starport is little more than a ring of landing pads
around a central terminal, all contained within a large
impact crater. Each pad can take a ship of up to 1,000
tons or slightly more if the pilot is careful and has large
ore-loading gantries close by. A semi-underground
monorail link runs through the crater wall into the city

proper. As the Travellers approach they will detect a
ship on one of the pads and a couple of small craft on
another. There is no other activity.

The ship is of a familiar type; an Argacan multipurpose
vessel whose transponder states it belongs to General
Products and is named Bright Face. Attempts at contact
get an automated reply but there is more than likely
no-one aboard. Similarly, the traffic control system tells
the Travelers their arrival has been noted but does not
engage in conversation. If it were not for the vehicles
they passed over on the way in, the Travellers might
think they were approaching a dead world.

###### ARRIVING ON DINOM

Disembarking from the ship requires the Travellers to
don vacc suits and walk to the terminal entrance at the
edge of the landing pad. Most basic ports at least have
a pressurised boarding tunnel or vehicles to allow new
arrivals to dress comfortably but Dinom’s World Board
sees no reason to spend money unnecessarily. Once
inside the terminal the Travellers can rent lockers for
their suits and change into something more comfortable
if they like. Weapons must be placed in the lockers as
well – Dinom has an overall Law Level of 5 but does
not permit anyone but security personnel to carry
weapon in the cities.

Finally the Travellers meet some actual people; a team
of bored and underworked terminal staff and security
guards. The latter are armed with handguns and batons,
and wear the same uniform as the rest of the world’s
security force. They are neither motivated nor particularly
competent but do insist the Travellers pass through a
TL9 weapons scanner. After a lackadaisical repeat of the
warning about unrest the Travellers are waved through.

A rail car is waiting for the Travellers. It passes through
a tunnel in the crater wall and underground for a
kilometre or so then surfaces for the last few hundred
metres. An airlocked section of track leads to a station
which is mostly automated. There is no startown as
such since Dinom receives few visitors but there are a
couple of hotels nearby. One, the Dinom Excellence, is
obviously far upmarket of the other. Since the Travellers
are on expenses and are expected to live a certain
lifestyle, it is the obvious choice.



Hotel rooms come with a business package, which
amounts to use of a small office and the chance to rent
a larger conferencing suite when required. It is a small
matter for the Travellers to upload a notice of their arrival
to the business databases and within seconds they
receive a reply from the office of the World Board. This
is automated, like almost everything else so far, and
amounts to a promise that a meeting will be scheduled
as soon as possible. This is almost immediately followed
by a personal call from someone who appears to be
bouncing around in an all-terrain vehicle.

The caller introduces himself as Chief Executive
Arlent Streen, currently responsible for in-system craft
operations and related matters. The World Board is
primarily interested in procuring a flotilla of shuttles
to better move ore between the surface and visiting
freighters. However, good offers are always welcome.
He is authorised to discuss other related matters,
including the purchase of one or more transport
starships and even an expansion to the port. He is about
to visit an ore processing plant that is having some
problems, so will have to either schedule a conference
call for this evening or meet in person in a few days
when he gets back to Rhylan. Either way, the Travellers
will need to find something to do in the meantime.

###### WANDERING AROUND

If the Travellers decide to take in the sights and
experience the vibrant recreation scene in Rhylan they
will be very disappointed. Most of the people on the
streets are sullen and wary of strangers, and there
are a lot of security personnel around. Some of these
are similar to the starport staff whilst others, although
wearing the same uniform, seem to be offworlders.
This impression is correct; the World Board greatly
expanded its security force without being very choosy
about professionalism and training. The Board trusts
its hired thugs more than most of the planetary security
force, which means that experienced security officers
are often overruled by less competent offworlders.

The Travellers will witness multiple instances of people
being stopped and questioned or even searched without
any apparent reason or cause. They may themselves
stopped and required to identify and account for
themselves, although this is far less likely if they are well
dressed. People in suits or uniforms seem to be more or
less invisible to the security patrols and are treated with
courtesy when there is an interaction. The Travellers will
not witness wanton brutality but there is an undercurrent
of mistrust and fear throughout local society.

One other thing is apparent; all the good bars and
restaurants charge a large entry fee, although this is
usually taken as a deposit against equally expensive
services. Those with less to spend must console
themselves with downmarket establishments, which are
often within view of the good ones. The Travellers may
observe an interesting facet of Dinom’s society. Those
who want to be elevated into the monied upper echelons
are expected to act like they already are members. They
will spend large amounts of money they cannot afford to
get into the right bars and events. A few might make the
right contacts and get a better job through them but most
just funnel their money upwards. Anyone able to fund
the lifestyle required to be noticed and accepted into the
upper echelons is already rich enough to be a member.

The Travellers do not have to worry about this too
much; they have a deep expenses account. However,
the upper-echelon facilities are not always pleasant.
They are likely to be filled with well-off people judging
everyone to see if they are worth interacting with and
desperate fake-well-off people hoping to make the
right friends before the cash runs out. Backstabbing,
toadying and bullying are commonplace. The Travellers
might or might not be uncomfortable in this environment
but either way it offers an insight into why there is
unrest on Dinom.

###### INVESTIGATING THE

###### GENERAL PRODUCTS SHIP

Public records show that the General Products ship
Bright Face is on contract to the World Board for
‘general transport duties’. This suggests it has been
involved in bringing in additional security personnel,
which would be a generally correct assumption. This
is not why Bright Face was sent to Dinom; she was
named for the world and targeted at clients there. Her
crew were instructed to generally make themselves
useful and promote General Products.

It is possible that the World Board might be induced
to buy some craft or even starships but that is a long
shot. The General team are primarily concerned with
trying to get contracts for heavy machinery or perhaps
a construction project to improve the starport. The
crew of Bright Face will not disclose this but it may be
possible to make some deductions. A number of pieces
of General Products heavy equipment have been
brought to Dinom for demonstration purposes. The
Travellers may become aware of them from favourable
slanted news reports or vivid criticism of ‘plans to
further marginalise the workforce’ by adopting a new
wave of megacorporate job-stealers.

##### The Bright Face

The General Products team have been the subject
of a fair amount of publicity since their arrival. The
official media hosts demonstrations of their great
equipment and excellent starship, and promises a more
prosperous future for everyone when General Products
invests in Dinom. Fringe channels present the same
story rather differently – more prosperity for the wealthy
and more security officers on the streets to keep the
workforce down.

The Travellers may be able to deduce the General
Products involvement in Dinom from all this without
going near the crew. If they do seek them out, they can
be found in the bar of the Dinom Excellence or one of
the better nearby entertainment venues. They come
over as a lot less arrogant than the crew of the Prime
Example and are happy to share a few drinks with the
Travellers providing they appear to be of equivalent
social status – the General Products team are also on
show here. Some of the crew seem happy enough to
have desperate locals toadying to them, whilst others
look uncomfortable. All have a job to do however, and
that job involves finding out why the Travellers are
here. Any interaction will be underlaid by corporate
rivalry and information-gathering.

Soon after the Travellers arrive on Dinom, the General
Products vessel lifts off on some errand. If the
Travellers have agreed to Sir Hamex’ plan he will be
aboard the vessel. If not, the ship is still sent out of the
system and is unavailable to take part in the events
unfolding on Dinom.

###### SIR HAMEX CALSTON

If Sir Hamex is with the Travellers, Dinom is a perfect
place to part ways with him. He suggests the Travellers
let him approach the General Products crew with a
proposal – the Imperial Navy will pay a hefty reward to
them for getting him home and he will match it with a
payment to the Travellers when he has access to his
family’s money. This way the awkward details of the
situation can be quietly glossed over. He will tell a story
of how his yacht was attacked somewhere other than
Fulacin, covering up his illicit meeting with General
Products. He will owe the Travellers a big favour for
this, and for their discretion about the matter and will
repay them over time.

If the Travellers are agreeable, Sir Hamex will contact
the General Products crew, who readily agree to give
him passage home. They depart soon afterward,
somewhat to the annoyance of the World Board who
still have work for them. The Travellers may correctly

assume that General Products has promised to
compensate the World Board for the loss of ‘their’ ship
for a few weeks.

###### INVESTIGATING THE

###### SITUATION ON DINOM

The planetary datanets are heavily controlled by the
mining companies on Dinom and are downplaying the
rebellion as just some troublemakers rioting and looting
for the fun of it. The official line is that the companies
are addressing worker grievances as best they can
and doing a pretty good job of it, but their efforts are
hampered by people with an agenda. Depending on
which news channel the Travellers watch the real
culprits are either Ine Givar terrorists or Zhodani agents,
although at no point is any actual proof presented.

Digging through the fringes of the mainstream
news, the Travellers will discern a different picture.
It appears that there is a full-scale revolt going on.
Rhylan is well secured, as are most parts of the two
other cities. However, Medianne and Napan have both
seen running street battles between angry workers
and security personnel. These are riots rather than
revolts but there does seem to be what amounts to
guerrilla warfare going on outside the cities. Some
settlements and installations appear to have been
taken over by the rebels, with amateurish efforts to
retake them generally ending in failure.

Neither side really knows what they are doing. The
rebels are just miners and prospectors who are tired
of mistreatment and the security forces have little
experience of anything bigger than a bar fight. Snippets
of illicit footage show raids to sabotage equipment and
the occasional carcass of an ATV holed by a mining
laser or blown off its wheels by an improvised explosive
charge. The amount of straight-out fighting that has
taken place is rather small, however. The situation
might best be described as severe social unrest with a
small rebellion taking place alongside it.

###### A CONVERSATION^

###### WITH ARLENT STREEN

Later in the day, the Travellers are informed they have
an incoming conference call from Executive Arlent
Streen. If they have done some research on him they
will know that – according to public records – he is a
powerful mining magnate who has been a member of
the World Board for several years. He is an effective

##### The Bright Face



businessman and generally considered to be one of
the more fair members of the upper echelon of society.
This translates to playing hard and squeezing any
situation for the maximum benefit but stopping short of
the blatant rapacity of some of his peers. This is one
reason he was chosen for his present assignment. He
is touring the outlying mines and ore processing plants
to try to negotiate with unhappy workers there.

Streen’s call includes two images. One is from a
pickup inside the helmet of the vacc suit he is wearing
and shows his face. The other is from a camera
mounted on the shoulder of one of his assistants. It
automatically tracks Streen so long as his assistant is
facing him and shows him outside among obviously
damaged ore-processing equipment. He has a couple
of bodyguards with him, plus some administrative
personnel. There are some other people nearby,
wearing heavy-duty work vacc suits.

Streen quickly explains that he is looking at the
damage caused by sabotage at the plant and will be
unable to hold a conference call with the Travellers that
evening. He wanted to send his personal apologies
and to reschedule for a day or two in the future. As he
is speaking the Travellers can see reflections of the
group Streen had come to meet with in his faceplate.
The image is distorted into a fish-eye panorama which
makes it difficult to interpret what the Travellers are
seeing. However, anyone who makes an Average (8+)
Recon check has time to recognise movement as some
of the workers draw guns.

If the Travellers do not see this or warn Streen, the first
shots come as a surprise. Some are aimed at other
workers, eliminating those who might interfere. The
rest are aimed at Streen’s party. One bodyguard is
killed instantly when her faceplate is shattered, along
with the assistant who was operating the camera.
All the Travellers will see from that point on is from a
sensor pointed at Streen’s face – which will tell a story
without conveying much useful information. If they call a
warning, the bodyguards react a bit quicker. One is still
fatally shot but manages to protect the camera operator.

The assailants do not want Streen dead. They plan to
use him as a hostage and perhaps force him to reveal
secrets or access codes held by his company. The plan
was to eliminate his staff and bodyguards then seize
him. Instead the workers have a fight on their hands.
An ‘assistant’ pulls a compact laser weapon out of an
attaché case and deploys its hidden armour. With this
in one hand and the gun in the other she lays down
suppressing fire and begins backing towards a nearby

group of ATVs. The surviving bodyguard engages some
workers rushing to cut off Streen’s retreat. His real
assistants flee with him.

The Travellers may witness this all unfold or perhaps
view it later from security footage. Either way, the
extraction is a professional one but it does not go
perfectly. Under cover of her case-shield, the laser
gunner holds off attempts to pursue from the front as one
of the ATVs surges forward and opens its doors. One of
the bodyguards is hit in the back, rupturing his air tanks.
He manages to shove Streen inside before collapsing.
The surviving members of the team scramble into the
airlock or cling to the outside of the vehicle as Streen’s
driver accelerates away from the ambush.

‘We need help,’ Streen says just before all comms from
the installation go out. This is one of those situations
where it really is just a downed transmitter; the rebels
have closed down the comms relay antenna, cutting
Streen off from outside contact. The World Board may
or may not be aware of the situation but in any case
they have other matters to attend to.

###### OPEN REBELLION

The Travellers may become aware of noise out in
the streets. The same situation is repeated in each of
the building complexes of Rhylan; a feeble attempt
is made at open rebellion. Gangs of workers, a
few of them armed, are making an attempt to seize
government centres and critical infrastructure. The
expected outpouring of popular support will not appear,
although there may be minor riots in some areas. The
security forces at the world’s de facto capital have been
strengthened and respond with escalation. For the most
part this means tear gas and batons but some of the
offworld security people are decidedly trigger-happy.

Within minutes the newsfeeds are filled with images
from ‘all cities and settlements’ showing a feeble
rebellion being put down with ease. The message that
‘security forces are bringing the situation under control’
is repeated over and over again. Astute Travellers may
notice that almost all the footage is from Rhylan, with
minimal coverage of the other cities. Fringe information
outlets do have some images from the other cities and
the situation there is anything but controlled.

Some rioters try to gain entry to the hotel the Travellers
are using. Their agenda might be to seize important
people for use as hostages or maybe they just want to
strike out at the injustice they feel but either way the
Travellers may be in danger. Hotel security is used to

##### The Bright Face

politely asking rich people not to make so much noise.
They have not faced a serious threat in their entire
careers and may well retreat in the face of one. On the
other hand most of the rioters are just frustrated and
angry, and may be unwilling to hurt people unless they
are provoked. If so, the Travellers may have a chance
to find a diplomatic solution.

The Travellers could fight the rioters. They are roaming
the hotel in small groups for the most part, so the
Travellers are unlikely to face more than five or six
opponents. There are no dedicated rebels among these
people; they are following the noisiest or the ones who
cause the most entertaining destruction. The Travellers
might be able to talk them down, perhaps persuading
them to stop frightening the hotel staff who are as
much victims as they are. They might even be able to
befriend the rioters. The Travellers might end up sitting
out the riot, swapping hilarious stories with the former
rioters over the contents of their rooms’ mini-bars.

Persuading any given group of rioters to leave the
Travellers – or someone else – alone requires a
bit of persuasion. Usually this will be accompanied
by an Average (8+) Persuade check but Diplomat
might also work. There are other options depending
on the circumstances. The Referee should reward
Travellers who play out the scene and come up with
a decent argument with a positive DM. It might even
be possible to calm down the situation in the hotel by
persuading multiple groups. If the Travellers request
assistance from the hotel, such as opening the bar for

everyone, staff will probably comply without hesitation.
Management might protest but they can be shown
the benefits of bribery over rioters just taking what
they want anyway. How an open bar in the middle of
a riot plays out depends very much on the Travellers’
handling of the situation.

The workers, for their part, are angry and will at
least want a verbal confrontation even if they are
willing to fight. They may cite all manner of injustices
the Travellers know nothing about and are likely
to consider offworlders to be in league with the
company fat cats who oppress them. Still, they are
for the most part just frustrated people caught up in
the moment and can be distracted or persuaded if
the Travellers try hard enough. Overall, the situation
in Rhylan is troubled but there is no real prospect of
the workers taking over. They will begin to slip away
quite quickly, with the hardcore routed by inept but
enthusiastic security personnel.

DINOM SECURITY PERSONNEL


About half of the city’s security personnel are locals.
They are treated slightly better than the average worker
and generally loyal to the ruling elite. This is in part
just professional habit; many of the security people
are also disaffected by their loyalty to one another
and their work ethic keeps them following orders... for
now. Some elements of the security force might be
persuaded to throw in their lot with the rebels.

The other half of the force consists of offworld
contractors. Some are quite skilled and professional
but there are far too many thugs and troublemakers
among them. This part of the force has no sympathy for
the local population and in many cases enjoy lording it
over them. Heavy-handedness is their stock in trade.
Both groups are equipped the same way, with a light
torso protector and helmet, a baton and a handgun. In
the present situation many have been issued carbine
versions of standard assault rifles.

by revolutionaries last they saw and was headed
generally north-west. There is no prospect of him
getting back to the monorail line, so his only chance is
to hazard a trek across the bright face of Dinom with
wounded people aboard a possibly damaged ATV. His
chances are not good.

1,800 kilometres is a long drive at the best of times but
the bright face is a brutal environment which will make
it even more dangerous. Streen’s shortest and fastest
route is a great circle, heading far north then swinging
back south, but this means heading into the hottest and
most dangerous terrain. Staying closer to the twilight
zone might be safer were it not for the pursuers. There
are also mountains to cross.

1,800 kilometres is not a long way for a starship. If
the Travellers can negotiate the rioting and the failed
revolution they could intercept Streen and rescue
his personnel. Locating him should not be hard; his
ATV comms system lacks the range to contact the
Travellers without a local repeater, which is currently
turned off. However, once within direct line of sight,
a starship comms system should be able to find his
signals and home in on them.

If the Travellers decide to help they will witness
fighting in the streets and may have to negotiate with
more rebels. Some are open to bribery, some can
be persuaded or evaded, and some might decide
to attack the Travellers. The same can be said for
the security forces. The Referee can make as much
or as little of the Travellers’ difficulties as seems
appropriate. Given how chaotic the situation is, a
starfarer crew making for their ship will not concern
the authorities very much – at least, not at first.

The Travellers will have little trouble getting to their ship
once they reach the starport. Everyone’s attention is on
the rebellion and a starship making a rapid departure is
no surprise. Absent any orders to intercept or impede the
Travellers, port staff mostly ignore them. The port has
not come under attack but it might, so staff are making
rather panicky defensive preparations just in case.

The quickest way to locate Streen would be to take a
ballistic path in the direction of his last known location
and begin a sensor search once above the mountains.
Locating the ATV takes just a few minutes but if the
Travellers succeed in an Average (8+) Electronics (sensors) check they can gain some additional
information. Streen’s party are aboard a wheeled ATV,
proceeding roughly north-west at what appears to be
an oddly low speed. There are other vehicles some
distance behind, apparently pursuers.

###### ASSISTING STREEN

It is possible the World Board knows that Arlent Streen
is in trouble. They are rather busy at present and lack
the resources to react and in any case the comms
blackout might have prevented his signal getting
through. If this is the case then only the Travellers
know where Streen is and how much danger he is in.
They may not care, of course, in which case he will be
left to his fate. However, the Travellers’ mission will be
furthered by making friends among the elite of Dinom
and what better way to do that than saving the life of a
World Board member?

Streen’s last known location was between the city
of Medianne and the mines north of it, about 1,600–
1,700 kilometres from Rhylan. He was being pursued

##### The Bright Face

Contact with the ATV is relatively easy once the
Travellers are in range. The position is not good.
Streen’s party are slogging across a particularly
cratered area and have taken damage to one of their
vehicle’s wheels. They are aware they are being
pursued but cannot be certain where the hostiles are.
All vehicles involved in the pursuit are unarmed but if
the pursuers catch up they will surely be able to cripple
Streen’s ATV and get inside.

There are various solutions to this problem. The
Travellers could direct Streen to hide his vehicle in
a crater or a dust pool and pick his crew up after the
pursuers have passed, or they could attempt a direct
rescue. This might have to be done under fire, which
is not a much of a problem if the ATV can be driven
straight into the ship. However, that would require
landing in a very cratered area with such precision that
the ATV can quickly board. It would be safer to hover
just above the surface and have Streen’s people leave
their vehicle to be pulled up into the ship.

**LANDING**
Selecting a suitable landing spot and directing the
ATV to head for it requires an Average (8+) Electronics (sensors) check. Setting the ship down in such rough
terrain without damaging it requires a Formidable (14+)
Pilot check. Failure does not indicate a crash unless
there are extreme circumstances such as a double 1 on
the dice which is also a failure with Effect -6 or worse.
Otherwise, the pilot will slightly prang the ship, doing 2
points of damage for every point of negative Effect.

If the Travellers manage this, the ATV can board
directly through the cargo doors providing there is
enough space available. The ATV requires a minimum
of 10 tons of cargo space to enter, which may require
some moving of items in the cargo bay or could be
completely impossible.

**HOVERING**
Hovering is easier, requiring only an Average (8+) Pilot
check to remain suitably steady. However, Streen and
his people will have to dismount from their vehicle and
assist their wounded to the ship. Travellers will then
have to pull them up. This is not all that difficult but it
will take time and during this the first of the pursuers
enter the crater. They are proceeding rather recklessly,
bouncing about and completely leaving the ground
at times. None of the pursuing ATVs has a mounted
weapon but vacc-suited rebels will open fire with
weapons similar to the assault carbines that arm the
world’s security forces.

The rebels may drop personnel off to shoot from a
couple of hundred metres away, whilst others stand up
in their ATV’s roof hatch or cling to an external panel.
Shooting under these conditions is extremely difficult,
with DM-8 imposed for a fast-moving ATV in rough
terrain and DM-4 if the rebels slow down to a sensible
speed. The Travellers are unlikely to be hit unless they
are very unlucky but there is still a real threat.

In addition to Streen, there are four people in the
ATV: his driver, the laser-armed bodyguard and two
assistants. One of them is wounded badly enough to
need carrying to the ship and manhandling up into the
cargo bay. Getting each able-bodied person aboard
takes 3D+6 seconds. The casualty takes three times as
long. To simulate the rather wild fire coming in, every
round there is a chance of something coming close
enough to matter. 8+ on a straight 2D check indicates
D3 attacks come close enough to be rolled for. The
rebels will still need to roll to successfully hit, of course.
Who is targeted is determined randomly.

The rebels are determined to capture Streen if they can
but they are not fanatics. Indeed, their morale in the face
of return fire is distinctly weak. They press their initial
attack in an amateurish and reckless manner, mostly
because they had already committed to it before the
starship arrived but once they take two or three casualties
they will waver and may break off in a panicky manner.

###### ENGAGING THE ATVS

If the Travellers want to they could easily eliminate
any or all of the pursuing ATVs. The RVSC personnel
aboard are uncomfortable with the idea, although
AutoGunner is positively enthusiastic. If the Travellers
took the missile option for their ship, they will find that
the ATVs are far too close to engage directly. They
could come up with a clever solution to this, such as
launching missiles upward in a very high arc to give
them time to arm, then driving down again. A couple

##### The Bright Face



of hundred metres is a rather small margin however,
though AutoGunner is happy to give it a try. A missile
engagement of this sort requires a Difficult (10+)
Gunner (turret) check to set up, and the missiles will
not auto-track such a small target. Effect of-6 or worse
will result in the Travellers’ ship or Streen’s ATV – or
both – being in the blast radius.

A safer option is to use the ship’s lasers. They are not
designed to be targeted on something as small as an
ATV and will suffer DM-2 on Gunner checks. Warning
shots might not work as there is no atmosphere for the
lasers to ionise. This means that beams and pulses
are invisible and the rebels may not at first realise the
explosions of vapourised rock they are seeing are
connected with weapons fire. Even amateurs like they
are will get the message sooner or later but in the
meantime the rebels will continue to shoot and close in.

Hits on an ATV with a starship laser are devastating.
The ATVs used by the rebels are a standard design,
with Protection +6 and Hull 60. Hits with starship-grade weapons multiply damage by 10. Thus the
ship’s dual pulse laser mounts do 2D+1 damage
plus Effect, all multiplied by 10. On average, this is
around 80–100 damage. Even after taking armour into
account, this is more than enough to wreck and ATV
and vaporise everyone inside. Doing so will produce
an instant and precipitate defeat.

###### THE BIGGER PICTURE

Streen is a member of the World Board and wants to
know what is going on planetwide. If the Travellers let
him use their ship’s communications system they will
be party to whatever he learns. Once communication
is established it quickly becomes apparent that all is
not well. Rhylan seems to be firmly in the hands of the
World Board but Napan has apparently fallen. There
is fighting in the streets in Medianne but so far the
security forces seem to be holding onto critical areas.

Broadcasts coming out of Napan certainly suggest
the rebels are in control. They have seized at least
some of the city’s critical infrastructure and are
broadcasting from the main governmental centre.
Members of the elite and at least one member
of the World Board have been captured and are
triumphantly displayed. Some are injured, although
there is no sign of deliberate mistreatment.

The rebels have been broadcasting a series of
rather confused messages since they launched
their attempted coup. The main narrative seems

remarkably modest; all major industry on Dinom will
become the property of the new Workers Council,
which declares its loyalty to the Imperium. Shares
in the main industries will be distributed among the
workers, with the elite permitted to keep enough to
live comfortably providing they leave Dinom and never
return. The Workers’ Council guarantees safe passage
to anyone who surrenders.

These messages are interspersed with rather rabid and
bloodthirsty exhortations to smash the elitists and shoot
the World Board out of hand, creating a great deal of
uncertainty and not really aiding the workers’ cause.
All of these messages are being fed onto the world
datanet and it may be possible to track their origins. A
Traveller willing to spend an hour and attempt a Difficult (10+) Electronics (computers) check can obtain one of
the following pieces of information on every success:
•	 The moderate messages are coming from two
sources. One is in the Cold Face mines south of
Napan, presumably the administrative centre for
the mines. It is reasonable to assume this is the
centre for the revolution and its headquarters.
Some broadcasts are coming from Napan itself.
•	 The more rabid messages are being inserted
into the data stream from an unknown location
or locations, which apparently bounces around
servers in multiple settlements.
•	 Someone with a more sophisticated knowledge of
datanet manipulation is making these broadcasts,
despite their rather simplistic content. That might
raise some questions if the Travellers think about it.

Arlent Streen feels that, under the circumstances,
he can speak for the World Board. He thanks the
Travellers for their assistance but wants to ask for
more. Their intervention could turn the tide of the
rebellion, he feels. This, of course, assumes he is alive.
If the Travellers did not come to his assistance he will
be someday found, faceplate shattered by a pistol
bullet, somewhere out on the bright face. In this case,
another member of the World Board will ask for the
Travellers’ assistance.

The Travellers receive signals from the rebels as well.
There are two variants, both coming from the main
rebel headquarters. The first simply states that the
situation has nothing to do with the Travellers and they
are requested to leave peacefully or remain at the
starport where their safety is guaranteed. The second
asks the Travellers to hand over Streen and anyone
with him, and to join the rebellion. The Travellers are
offered high status in the new world government if they
contribute to victory. They will be leaders of the world’s

##### The Bright Face

interstellar commerce fleet – not difficult since theirs is
the only ship the rebels would have – and will have a
say in governing an entire planet.

The rebels may or may not intend to keep the second
promise but they are realistic enough to know that
they do not need more enemies. The rebels will allow
the Travellers to depart even if they take Streen or
other members of the World Board with them. If the
Travellers have acted against the rebels and caused
casualties there will be some who want revenge but the
rebel leaders know it is in their interests to simply let
the Travellers leave.

###### CHIEF EXECUTIVE ARLENT STREEN

Arlent Streen is a member of the World Board on
Dinom and a major shareholder in several of the
world’s industries. His holdings include mines and ore
processing equipment but also some industry and
infrastructure maintenance companies. He is not the
owner of these firms but is a major shareholder with a
great deal of influence. The majority of his holdings are
in and around Medianne.

Streen is little more popular with the workers than other
World Board members but is not hated as some are.
His policies are one-sided, geared towards making
money for the shareholders above all else but he is
aware that the workers will tolerate only so much.
He is also adept at influencing company operators to
follow his agenda in a way that allows him to distance
himself from the ill-treatment of workers. There are
some members of the working class who actually think
he is more favourable towards them than the company
owners they work for.

Like many of the upper echelon of Dinom society,
Streen is not a bad man, in that he is not deliberately
cruel to anyone and means nobody harm other than
his business competitors. He cares little for ordinary
people, however, and will act towards the Travellers
according to his estimation of them. Those who seem
like important corporate figures he will treat as peers,
whilst those who are ‘just workers’ receive little more
than basic courtesy. This is tempered by a more human
side; Streen has had a good scare and those who
helped him will not be forgotten.

Streen is an opportunist and as his initial terror fades
he begins to see threats and opportunities. He wants to
make sure the facilities he has shares in are protected
but does not mind too much if those of his competitors
are taken by the rebels or handed over in negotiations.
He soon begins planning to gain the most he can out

of the situation. If he can create the impression of
being the saviour of Medianne, that will raise his status.
He might even become sole planetary governor if he
orchestrates the crushing of the rebellion. If, on the
other hand, negotiations are necessary he wants to
lead them. Handled well enough, that could have the
same result – Streen comes out on top – although with
a shifting of power to give the Workers Council more
say in governance. He will thus attempt to thread a
careful path through the situation, trying to at once be a
potential friend to the rebels and their nemesis.

###### ESCAPE FROM NAPAN

Whether it comes from Streen or some other member
of the World Board, the Travellers receive a request for
assistance. It appears that Napan is more or less in the
hands of the Workers Council, although there is some
fighting still ongoing. They have captured numerous

members of the planetary elite, whose fate is at present
unknown. Others have attempted an escape from
the city by way of the monorail system. Of these, the
earliest to flee made it to Medianne and have begun
proceeding to Rhylan where they will set up an interim
crisis council. However, rebel forces have disabled
the monorail in that direction. A trainload of managers,
shareholders and executives, and their families, have
been forced to leave the city eastward towards the
unfinished section of the monorail.

There is no way to reach the stranded people before
the rebels do, other than the Travellers’ starship. Streen (or his replacement) therefore requests they proceed
immediately to the unfinished monorail section and
attempt a rescue. There should be a dozen or so people
there, most of them families and dependents. If they
can be extracted before the rebels close in the position
of the World Board will be stronger. Streen reminds the
Travellers that at least some of the rebels are openly
calling for the execution of captured enemies.

COMPLICATIONS


If the Travellers agree, the end of the monorail is not
hard to find; just fly east and follow the tracks or pick
them up after crossing the mountains west of Rhylan.
There is, however, a complication. As the Travellers are
proceeding towards the unfinished monorail system
their threat warning system indicates they are being
tracked by aerospace defence systems of an unknown
type. Streen, if he is present, looks as puzzled as
anyone else but answers oddly if confronted about it.

‘They’re not active yet,’ says Streen about the
aerospace defence systems. Clearly they are; missile
plumes are detected rising from a mountainous area
south of Napan. The missiles are curving towards
the Travellers’ ship but are not on an intercept vector.
AutoGunner, or a Traveller experienced in gunnery,
can predict the missiles’ trajectory; they are trying to hit
the Travellers’ ship but cannot change vector quickly
enough. The reason for this is that their powerful initial
boost is designed to get the missiles to orbital height
quickly. They simply have too much initial velocity to
engage a lower target unless the Travellers are more or
less directly overhead.

As the Travellers realise there is a cone in which the
missiles can engage them and thus all they have
to do is stay out of it, a second launch is detected.
This is moving much more slowly. The rebels have
disabled the initial high-boost phase. The missiles are
curving towards the Travellers’ ship and simulations
predict an engagement this time. There are three

missiles in this salvo, each following an independent
trajectory. They will attack separately using different
techniques, as if the gunners are experimenting. One
takes a high-powered least-time course as soon as
it is high enough; another is lobbed much higher and
accelerates downward. The first engagement will occur
in 2D minutes, the others 1D and 3D minutes after that.

Streen says that the World Board did spend some
money on planetary defence a few years back.
Bunkers were dug close to each city, to be equipped
with a vertical-launch PAD (Planetary Aerospace
Defence ) missile system. The project was never
finished however; complications with weapon
procurement and construction delayed installation
of the weapons. Only the bunker at Rhylan is
operational, with a handful of missiles available. It is
still in the hands of the World Board.

Someone must have smuggled missiles on-planet
and set them up somewhere before the revolution.
That suggests a level of preparation that might be
beyond a rabble of disaffected workers and the sort of
connections required to orchestrate arming the rebels
with anti-ship missiles. In the interim the Travellers
need to deal with the immediate threat.

The Referee should determine the time to impact as
soon as the missiles are detected and keep track of
each starship combat round that passes. Travellers
can take normal actions in this time. If a partial round
remains before a particular missile impacts, Travellers
can take actions but suffer DM-1 for every minute less
than the full six that remains, so if a missile was nine
minutes out the Travellers could take one action against
it as normal and another with DM-3 as only three of the
normal six minutes are available.

Firing on the missiles using the ship’s lasers is treated
as normal point defence, although any hit will destroy
a single missile. If the Travellers choose to evade
they can extend the time for a given missile to reach
detonation range by the amount of Thrust applied that
round but this is not without hazards. The missiles are
all following different trajectories so Thrust must be
applied separately between them if the pilot wants to
increase impact time for more than one. An Average (8+) Pilot check must be made with a negative DM
equal to the maximum Thrust being applied against any
one missile to avoid getting too close to the ground. If
this is failed the pilot must immediately pass a Difficult (10+) Pilot check with no DM for thrust to avoid clipping
an obstruction close to the ground. This will do 1D
damage to the ship per point of negative Effect.

##### The Bright Face

The Travellers may discover that by diving very low
and using the monorail tubes as sensor cover they
can evade detection and targeting. If they do not do
this they will be attacked by salvoes of two to four
missiles every D3 rounds. From the low rate of fire
the Travellers may infer that the weapons are being
manually loaded onto improvised launchers.

###### THE MONORAIL RESCUE

The monorail system runs in two parallel tubes, linked
in places by personnel accessways and occasionally by
wider areas where a train can be switched to the other
line. Normally there is an ‘eastward’ and a ‘westward’
line but the possibility of damage or a stuck train makes
it necessary to swap lines from time-to-time.

The tunnels are unpressurised but do have retractable
doors every few kilometres in case compartmentalisation
is necessary. Trains, consisting of a power car and
one or more passenger or freight cars, hang from an
overhead single rail. This is unpowered; all trains use
fuel cells which are swapped at the rail depot at Rhylan.
Cars are pressurised and linked by a flexible corridor.
The whole system is simple and robust, and capable of
running huge trainloads of ore back to the starport.

The rebels tried to halt the progress of the escaping train
by closing the internal doors but automated systems
opened them again as it passed. A second train was
seized to carry a pursuit party and now it is just 20
minutes or so from the end of the line. The escapees
have reached that point and have nowhere left to go.
They are inside a pressurised two-car train, with few
weapons and a handful of vacc suits between them.

The pursuers are aboard a cargo train. Even empty,
it masses much more than the passenger vehicle. A
collision at speed would send the wreckage of both
out of the end of the tunnel, probably killing everyone
aboard. A slower nudge would push the smaller train
off the end of the rail, causing it to crash down to the
ground outside. In the low gravity of Dinom this might
be survivable but injuries are certain.

The pursuers are rebels with a job to do, not
hardcore killers... for the most part. The majority
will try to capture their enemies and will fight to
suppress resistance. The pursuers hope their victims
will simply surrender, in which case they can be
taken back aboard the passenger train and used as
hostages. If that does not work they will dismount
from the train and force the escapees to surrender

at gunpoint. Resistance will have to be squashed
and that means firing at a pressurised passenger car
containing children.

However, there is a minority among the pursuers with
a different agenda. They are Ine Givar members,
dedicated to the overthrow of the Imperium, and they
have a mission to make the conflict on Dinom as bloody
as possible. This group are not aware of the bigger
picture – they are just foot soldiers – but they are
confident in their leaders and dedicated to the cause.
They will fight longer and harder than the workers,
although they are not in any way a suicide squad. They
will stop short of deliberately shooting at children but
are entirely willing to smash their train into the halted
one no matter who is aboard.

The Ine Givar contingent has a far more aggressive
plan. They intend to approach quickly as if they are
planning to stop at the last second and board the
passenger train. In fact they are going to jam the
controls and detach the rearmost cargo car of their
train. As it stops using its emergency brakes, all
the freight cars will continue and smash the lighter
passenger train into tiny bits. Rebels will be killed
in the crash and survivors can then be eliminated.
By creating martyrs on both sides they will ensure
escalation of the conflict.

The Travellers will need to rescue a group of frightened
civilians, including multiple children, from a halted
monorail train in an unpressurised tunnel. This requires
persuading people to don emergency suits or get into
rescue balls and leave the train, which may not be easy
to do. Most of these people have led very privileged
lives. Some are of a ‘save me or I’ll sue you’ mentality,
which is as solidly entrenched as it is stupid. They
genuinely believe it is the duty of others to get them out
of this predicament in comfort. There will be indignant
refusals to don suits or climb into anything, coupled with
declarations that ‘there are children here!’ as if that will
make the Travellers suddenly become more able to help.

The Travellers should roleplay their interactions with the
escapees rather than just making a skill check. Pointing
out that there is a huge freight train barrelling straight
at them and it cannot be relied upon to stop would
get through to most people but there is no guarantee
here. Against a backdrop of screaming children and
entitled parents’ demands they will have to persuade
the escapees to leave the safety of the passenger train.
Doing so from a distance would be Very Difficult (12+)
at best but if the Travellers come to the train in person it
will become much easier to talk people into doing what
must be done. The best approach would be a firm but

##### The Bright Face



patient insistence in person, accompanied by assistance
in donning emergency suits or getting kids into rescue
balls. The latter can be rolled by another person or the
user can walk inside and cause them to roll but they are
prone to snagging and could rip on a projection.

The rescue should be roleplayed out using as
many of the following incidents as seems desirable.
The Travellers could buy some time by manually
commanding the internal compartmentalisation doors
to close further down the track. This will force the
pursuers to slow down until they can get an override
from the rail depot at Napan. As they begin accelerating
again, the monitors at the link gantry and aboard the
passenger train will predict an increasingly destructive
collision if the freight train does not slow down.

The end of the monorail is a construction site and
currently abandoned. The two tubes run aboveground,
on supports sunk into the bedrock, linked by a
supporting frame but each is capable of standing alone.
The lowest point of each tube is four metres above the
ground at this point; height varies with terrain contours
over the length of the line, at times passing through
ridges or running high above crater floors.

1. Passenger Car: This car contains 14 people,
   about half of them children, who are families and
   dependents of executives. In some cases they
   have been separated from other family members
   or from executives who have sent them away for

safety whilst they try to stabilise the situation. The
passenger car has several emergency softsuits
and rescue balls, and can be exited through its rear
hatch or by way of the power car.

2. Power Car: The power and drive systems are fully
   enclosed, with a simple manual control system for
   occasions when the monorail is not being controlled
   by its centralised operating system. The escapees
   used manual control to override the rebels’ attempt
   to recall the train. There are additional rescue balls
   and softsuits in this car.

The train does not have an airlock. The hatches at
each end of the linking corridors can act as an airlock
between two linked cars, or one car can be used as
an airlock with personnel clambering down onto the
track in softsuits. This is the recommended emergency
escape method. Notices about it are posted in all cars,
though it has never been necessary since work on the
monorail was begun.

3. Eastbound Tube: The tubes are wide enough
   to accommodate large ore carriers or the much
   smaller passenger cars. Internal diameter of the
   tube is some eight metres.
4. Link Gantry: The gantry’s personnel platforms at
   each end can be accessed directly from an ore car
   or by way of an extending platform. Normally this

##### The Bright Face

is automatically activated when a car is stopped
alongside it. Getting up to the platform from the
tube floor is possible by way of handholds set
into the walls. Personnel in the tunnel would not
normally be endangered by a passenger train but
would have to crouch in the centre to avoid being
crushed by an ore train. The gantry is not enclosed
between the tunnels. There are manual control
points for internal doors on the gantry platforms.

5. Westbound Tube: This is more or less identical
   to the eastbound equivalent. The outer walls of
   the tube are constructed from a material made
   by liquifying local rock and resetting it as a form
   of moulded concrete. It is known universally as
   concret, from CONstruction acCRETion, and is
   much stronger than the material known as concrete
   in lower-technology societies.
6. Temporary Ramp: A ramp of compacted rubble
   faced with a thin layer of concret gives easy
   access to the westbound tunnel. A vehicle could be
   driven up into the tunnel and placed under the link
   gantry’s end point.
7. Levelled Surface: The surface of Dinom has
   been roughly levelled off for a kilometre or
   more ahead of the tube endings and a plinth is
   under construction for the next support about
   200 metres ahead. Beyond that the projected
   route of the monorail can be traced but no work
   has begun. There are vehicles, mostly open
   earthmoving and construction types, scattered
   here and there. The workforce have fled or gone
   to join the revolution in whatever transportation
   vehicles may have been present.
8. Mobile Crane: The crane not only lifts sections of
   rail or construction material into place, it also has a
   nozzle for spraying liquid concret over a framework.
   The usual practice is to create a frame and line it
   with a thin polymer membrane then spray concret
   over it, repeating the process to build up a strong
   and airtight structure in multiple layers.
9. Bulldozer: The bulldozer has a pressurised cab
   which could squeeze a couple of additional people
   in. It is tall enough to be used as a platform to get
   up to or down from a halted train.

**INCIDENTS**
The following vignettes are characteristic of the
situation. They may be repeated more than once, with
some variation.

AN ENTITLED PARENT: One of the train passengers
is particularly self-important, not to mention scared out
of their wits. They try to take control of the situation by
fixing what they can – or attempting to do so – whilst
ignoring the bigger picture. This individual pesters
the Travellers with demands they find a better fitting
softsuit, or a proper vacc suit, and keeps wanting to
know how the Travellers propose to get their children to
safety. This behaviour might even extend to demanding
a Traveller give their vacc suit to the parent, or trying to
drag someone else’s child out of a recue ball because
their own kids deserve the best ones. The Travellers
might try diplomacy or just manhandle the entitled idiot,
or something else entirely. Even a flawless rescue will
not make this person grateful. They will pick faults and
threaten legal action over the tiniest imagined error
or lack of respect.

SCARED CHILDREN: Not surprisingly, scared
children can be difficult. They will not want to get into
rescue balls and may behave in an irrational manner.
One may refuse to be rescued and have to be forced
into a rescue ball; another may hide. Some of these
kids are the offspring of entitled parents like the one
above. Others are just terrified and reacting to what
is in front of them rather than dealing with the wider
situation. A Traveller might end up trying to figure out
how to stuff a violently struggling six-year-old into a
rescue ball whilst the screaming kid pounds on their
faceplate with tiny but determined fists.

SUITING UP: A lot of people on Dinom never go
outside their pressurised building complexes and did
not really pay attention during the mandatory safety
briefings. Now they need to get into a suit whilst in a
state of mortal terror and they are really struggling.
The Travellers will have to deal with several people all
failing to get suited up at once. If they are not rigorous
in checking suits someone might leave a connection
loose, which will become apparent once there is no
pressure outside. The Travellers may have to restrain
a panicking individual and hold them down whilst
someone else fixes their suit.

COAXING SOMEONE OUT: Even when everyone
is suited or in rescue balls, there will be difficulties.
Getting frightened people out of the – admittedly
illusory – safety of the train will prove difficult.
There will be some who balk at this point, or who
start to panic. Coaxing is one solution, although
just grabbing someone and shoving may be more
effective in the short term. Rescue balls will bang
together and bounce off one another, sending the
occupants rolling helplessly away.

##### The Bright Face



ONTO THE GANTRY: If the Travellers think of it, they
can reverse the train a little and step straight onto the
gantry leading to the link tunnel after it extends to meet
the train’s door. If they instead descend to ground level
they will have to climb the handholds in the wall. This is
doable for someone in a softsuit, although there is a risk
of snagging, but rescue balls must be lifted. Dinom has
low gravity, so it is possible to lift a rescue ball – especially
if it contains someone small and light such as a child –
up part of the way. Rolling the ball up the curved wall is
also an option, as is snagging the rescue cord on the ball
and lifting from above. It might even be possible to hurl
a rescue ball up, although this would be disconcerting at
best for the occupant. The Referee should also take into
account the possibility of a child in the rescue ball violently
struggling as Travellers try to balance it for lifting.

Out the Front Door: Rather than using the gantry,
the Travellers might go out the nearby end of the tube.
This is well above ground level, however. Jumping is
an option, given the low gravity, but the landing area is
uneven and strewn with construction debris. A Difficult (10+) Vacc Suit check is required to avoid injury, with the
unfortunate subject suffering 1D damage for every point
of negative Effect. Damage to ankles is the most likely
result but a fall results on Effect -2 or worse. This could
cause harm anywhere and may rip a softsuit. Rescue
balls dropped from the tube may bounce alarmingly and
could also rip. Providing they do not, the occupant will
not be hurt from the fall, although they may be terrified,
disorientated and possibly covered in vomit.

In the event of a fall or bouncing rescue ball, a Vacc
Suit check, or a straight 2D check in the case of a
rescue ball, determines whether or not a tear occurs.
On Effect -1 to -5 the tear is small, causing 1D damage
per round until sealed. On Effect -6 or worse the tear is
serious, causing 2D damage. Sadistic Referees might
like to consider the possibility that a deflating rescue
ball might propel itself around erratically. The chance to
avoid a rip is as follows.

Worker-type reinforced vacc suit 4+
Standard starship-type vacc suit 6+
Rescue ball 8+
Softsuit 10+

The Travellers might find other ways down from the
tube entrance. It would be much easier to climb onto
the crane job or the cab of the bulldozer if they can be
repositioned. Both are in workable condition and can
be driven by anyone who enters the cab. Drive (track)
checks are necessary for anything but the simplest
manoeuvres undertaken with great care.

###### COLLISION IMMINENT

It will become apparent at some point that the freight train
is travelling at a recklessly high speed and will collide
with the passenger cars still at the end of the tube. If the
Travellers contact the rebels on the train and ask them to
stop, they will trigger what was going to happen anyway.
The rebels state they have no intention of harming anyone
who does not resist. They intend to take the occupants
of the passenger train prisoner and return up the line
to Napan with them. Offworlders are requested not to
interfere and will be left alone if they do so.

Anyone monitoring the channel hears a confused
conversation in the background. Someone announces the
controls are not responding, then an argument breaks out.
It quickly escalates into several voices shouting for others
to drop their weapons, then a shot is heard. It is followed
by others and whoever the Travellers were speaking to
shouts, ‘Get them out of the way! It’s not going to stop!’.
More shots follow, then the channel is cut. Moments later
the monitors detect the freight train’s last car uncouple
itself and apply its emergency brakes. The rest of the train
continues to accelerate.

If the Travellers were not in contact with the rebels this
happens ‘off camera’ but they may find out about it later
from someone else. The pursuit force included a handful
of Ine Givar members who want to cause a collision that
kills members of both sides. The more hate they can
stir up, the greater the benefit to their cause. They have
eliminated the ordinary rebels and retired to the last
car which is braking to a stop. The rest of the train will
continue to accelerate until it runs out of line. After the
collision, the Ine Givar operatives intend to walk the rest
of the way to check on their victims then wait for a new
power car to be run up the line to collect them.

How this plays out depends on the Travellers. If they
come up with a clever solution, such as somehow
derailing the freight train, the Referee should let them
try it. Sending the passenger train back up the line
requires over-riding its safety system which is designed
to prevent a collision but it can be done. The freight
train will not stop; its controls are smashed. A collision
will not stop the much heavier mass going the other
way, though pushing the twisted wreck ahead of it will
slow the freight train and could perhaps distort the
monorail enough to bring it eventually to a stop. It will
certainly buy some time.

More than likely the Travellers’ efforts will be directed
towards getting everyone out of the way. The exact
timing of the train’s arrival is a little fluid, to allow for
dramatic pace-setting. The Travellers might go down to

##### The Bright Face

the wire, hurling rescue balls up to the gantry then diving
flat as the freight train screams by just above them. They
may tumble out of the tube mouth and scatter as the
freight train hurtles off the end of the line. If they are well
organised they may have the satisfaction of watching the
train wreck well after they have rescued everyone.

If the freight train still has any significant momentum
when it exits the tube it will travel a surprisingly long
way before impacting the ground, due to Dinom’s low
gravity. The destruction will be significant, making it
difficult to search through the wreckage for evidence or
clues about what happened. The Ine Givar operatives
in the tube will retreat if they think they will face
opposition. The Travellers could pursue but it may
be more important to get the survivors to safety. In
any case the missile launchers near Napan will begin
lobbing missiles high and sending them down into the
general area of the tube end in the hope one will lock
onto the Travellers’ ship. It might be best to depart the
area before one gets lucky.

###### THE BATTLE OF MEDIANNE

Whatever the outcome of the monorail rescue, the fight
for control over Dinom is moving towards a climax.
Rhylan is firmly in the hands of the World Board, whilst
Napan is about 80% controlled by the rebels and will
soon be completely under their dominance. Medianne
is mostly controlled by the World Board, although some
building complexes are contested and a few are in
rebel hands. Extreme measures such as venting enemy
held complexes to space are not available to either side
as there are civilians inside. The Ine Givar operatives
within the rebel force would be willing to do it, however.

At first glance it appears that the World Board is
winning the fight. However, there is a problem. A
large force of rebels is moving overland towards
Medianne. They are using every form of transport
they could gather, with combat personnel carried
aboard converted ore sleds dragged by ATVs. This
force might be enough to turn the tide of the battle,
especially as it has the ability to force entry into the
city at any point. This is provided by a number of
mining lasers which have been crudely mounted onto
construction vehicles. The latter are slow-moving
under their own power but are being dragged on
sleds. If they can deploy close to the city they will be
able to burn an entry point with sufficient precision to
keep collateral casualties to an acceptable level.

The defenders really have no counter to this threat.
Medianne is not a fortified city and there are no armed
forces on Dinom – just a rather poor security service. If

the lasers are brought close to the city the rebels will be
able to storm whatever buildings they like or threaten
to cause mass casualties if they are so inclined. The
only possibility is to keep the lasers away from the city,
which means either creating a defensive line in front of
the city or launching a mobile counterattack.

What troops can be spared from the fighting in the city
are loaded aboard ATVs and other vehicles, heading
out towards the incoming rebel army. There is little
uniformity or discipline among the counterattackers, just
a general rush forward. Their goal is the Anakka Ridge,
a few kilometres outside the city. Bounded at one end
by the Irkhar Crater and at the other by a region of
broken ground, it is the only defensive position of any
worth within reach. Detachments peel off towards the
crater and the broken area to cover the flanks whilst the
main force makes for the ridge line. It is soon apparent
they are not going to get there in time.

The lead elements of the rebel force crest the ridge and
begin descending as the first defenders get into range.
Nobody has any idea what they are doing here, so the
ensuing fight becomes a scramble, with ATVs ramming
one another and intense small arms fire battering at
their hulls. Some personnel are dropped to fight on foot
whilst others fire wildly from moving vehicles. The lead
elements of the rebel force are outnumbered and if
anything slightly more inept than the defenders but they
have an advantage.

Few among the rebels know they have offworld
benefactors and fewer still suspect it is the Ine Givar.
Support has not been immense but did include
quantities of rocket-propelled grenade launchers and
shoulder-fired guided missiles. Some of the rebels
have been trained with these and let fly with more
enthusiasm than skill. Most of the hits scored are lucky
but within the force are a few Ine Givar operatives
who are more capable in using the weapons. It would
take a careful observation of the situation to notice
this but Travellers who possess Tactics (military) may
realise that a small percentage of the rebel force are
accounting for a lot of the defenders’ vehicles.

If the Travellers do not intervene in a meaningful
fashion, or if they assist the rebels in any effective
manner, Medianne will fall to the Workers’ Council.
If they choose to help defend Medianne they may
determine the outcome of the battle and the fate of an
entire world. Arlent Streen or another member of the
World Board will certainly request their assistance.
If the Travellers want to make demands they can
negotiate for their help but that does not mean a deal
made under duress will necessarily be honoured.

##### The Bright Face



1. Outskirts of Medianne: The city is composed of
   multiple complexes of sealed buildings linked by
   personnel and vehicle tunnels.
2. Irkhar Crater: The crater is deep, with treacherous
   pools of deep dust and regions of unstable surface.
   It might be passable in a vehicle but only with great
   care at an extremely low speed.
3. Anakka Ridge: This section is very steep and
   faced with loose rock.
4. Collapsed Section: Personnel could climb the
   rubble with care but vehicles are likely to get stuck
   or slide back down.
5. Anakka Ridge: This section is lower and smoother,
   allowing an easy passage for vehicles.
6. Broken Ground: Tumbled boulders provide cover
   for infantry and block the passage of vehicles.
7. Extraction Plant: A small ore extraction plant
   exploits a rich vein close to the surface. A deep
   crevasse to the south also has exposed veins,
   which are mined using machinery lowered on
   gantries. Spoil is deposited in the bottom.

COURSE OF THE BATTLE


The battle for Medianne begins as the first rebel
vehicles crest the Anakka Ridge. A fierce but rather
inept firefight breaks out, with vehicles ramming one
another at times. On other occasions infantry manage
to get aboard a vehicle and begin attacking its hatches
or vision panels. This phase of the battle is total chaos,
in which the defenders come off worst.

What follows is characterised by a running fight back
towards the city. Some of the defenders take up
positions atop the extraction plant, on its conveyors
or atop its towers. This creates an obstacle for the
attackers and allows some of the defenders’ vehicles
to rally and make a semi-organised counterattack. The
extraction plant becomes a primary target for heavy
weapons – the few there are – and ground assault.

If the Travellers do nothing to prevent it, the defenders
lose their hold on the excavation plant and are pushed
back until their defence suddenly turns into a rout.
Some make it back to the city but soon there are
mining lasers burning holes in building complexed.
Each is evacuated in turn and the defenders try to
repel the assault but as more and more complexes are
breached the defenders are spread too thin and the
civilian population is packed into too small an area. A
few trains escape down the monorail to Rhylan before

##### The Bright Face

the lines are cut by the rebels. Ultimately, Medianne is
forced to surrender. With two of its three cities under
rebel control, the fate of Dinom appears to be sealed.

**THE TRAVELLERS AT MEDIANNE**
The Travellers could join either side, do nothing, or act
as a rescue service for the wounded – whatever they
think is best. If they offer to remain neutral and rescue
casualties, both sides will agree to give them safe
passage. That does not prevent the odd stray shot of
course, and perhaps an ‘unfortunately’ aimed rocket,
but overall the Travellers’ neutrality will be respected so
long as they operate without favour. Rescue operations
will not affect the outcome of the battle.

The defenders do not have much weaponry that can
harm the Traveller’s ship. If they join the rebels, they
are essentially flying an impenetrable fortress and
can do as they please. The ship will get dinged and
bashed, and the RVSC personnel aboard will wince at
every tiny impact but the Travellers have free rein to
intervene at their leisure.

If the Travellers join the defenders, or the rebels think
they have, things are different. The rebels have plenty
of unguided rocket-propelled grenades and a starship
is a big target. Even with damage reduced to one-tenth,
the ship will suffer at least cosmetic effects if hit and
it will be a priority target. Most of the 60mm grenades
launched by the rebels will miss, eventually coming
down... somewhere. They do have guided missiles
as well, and these will hit a lot more often. The ship’s
lasers cannot target something so small. In short, if
the Travellers take their ship into the battle zone it
will receive a constant nibbling, with the possibility of
a lucky hit taking out antennae or other vulnerable
systems and impeding ship operations.

During the various phases of the battle the Travellers
can influence the outcome and the aftermath in
various ways. The Referee needs to keep track of a
DM which will be used later. This is named Victory and
begins with a value of +0. Victory is used to determine
the final outcome of the battle but is irrelevant if the
Travellers stay neutral or join the rebels; in that case
events will unfold as already described. If Victory
reaches -10, the defenders will surrender even if the
battle seems to still be in doubt.

**BATTLE PHASE 1: THE INITIAL CLASH**
During this phase of the fight it is not clear who is
winning, nor which side any given vehicle is on. If they
look hard enough the Travellers will be able to discern
identification marks – a pair of stripes in vivid colours

- on the side of rebel vehicles. These are difficult to

make out at the best of times, with dust thrown up
and vehicles making wild manoeuvres, and cannot
be seen from beyond ground-launched missile range.
Optical sensors could do so easily if they could be kept
focused on a target for long enough but that is unlikely
under the circumstances. If the Travellers want to use
their lasers or missiles from outside response range
they will probably have to accept they will hit as many
defenders as attackers.

To identify a target at small arms range a Traveller must
pass an Average (8+) Recon check, otherwise there is
a 50–50 chance a given vehicle or group of personnel
belongs to either side. The fact they are firing at the
Travellers is a useful guide, although if their actions
have been ambiguous thus far there is a chance that
friendly fire might beget more friendly fire.

Similar comments apply for much of the battle, with
vehicles intermixed during most stages. However,
there will be some clear targets. A group of personnel
launching rockets at the extraction plant are certain to
be rebels, for example. The rear echelons of the rebel
force are also easy to identify. The Travellers could take
out the mining lasers with a few laser shots or missiles,
if they identify the threat. That is by no means likely, as
the Travellers would have to realise what the objects
on some of the vehicles are and figure out they could
be used to breach the city. If the Travellers do spot the
problem and pre-empt it, so be it, but the Referee should
not suggest this course of action as it shortcuts past
some of the drama unfolding in front of the Travellers.

During this phase of the battle the Travellers might join
in at ground level, try to give support from their ship, or
almost anything else. If they are taking fire the Referee
should remind them they have the people they just
rescued aboard. One reasonable option is acting as an
observation and command post. Neither side will just
start taking orders from some randoms in a spaceship
but Arlent Streen could liaise with the defenders and
set up a conduit for reconnaissance and advice.

The Travellers could easily penetrate either or both
sides’ communications. Both are using civilian vehicles
with ordinary comm systems. These are designed to
talk to one another and to any other comms system in
range. Getting into the comms net is no harder than
contacting a nearby vehicle on any other day. The
Travellers might try to deceive one side, rally the other,
offer advice or shout inventive taunts just for the fun of
it. It is possible that clever Travellers could take part of
a force out of the fight by deception. They might even
cause a retreat. This would not be a simple matter of

##### The Bright Face



a single check of course. Whether they try to help or
hinder, the Travellers will find themselves using skills
such as Tactics, Persuade, Recon and any others that
might apply over the course of their efforts.

Monitoring the communications situation will yield
information; some vehicles among the rebels are
using military-grade encryption. This is not something
normally encountered aboard miners’ vehicles. The
Travellers lack the means to break this encryption

- even if they know about the intelligence package

at this point it is not designed for cryptoanalysis.
They may be able to log samples of the signals to
compare them to known encryption packages later,
and a successful Average (8+) Electronics (comms)
check allows the Travellers to identify one of the
vehicles using encrypted communications. This can be
attempted every phase of the battle. If the Travellers
can directly or indirectly take these vehicles out – such
as by identifying one as a primary target to the other
side – they will impede the rebels greatly as these are
command vehicles crewed by Ine Givar operatives.

Spoofing the rebels’ communications or otherwise
causing confusion increases the Victory DM by +1,
or +2 if the Travellers do something particularly
clever. Eliminating one or more command vehicles
increases Victory by +2. It also makes post-conflict
reconciliation more likely as the Ine Givar operatives
would otherwise have pushed for harsher treatment
of the defeated population or might have carried out
an atrocity themselves.

BATTLE PHASE 2: CRATER FIASCO
Some of the rebels attempt to launch a flanking
movement through the Irkhar Crater. This goes well
at first; a couple of ATVs and some smaller vehicles
leaping into the crater from the far wall. This dramatic
entrance goes awry when the first buggy lands in a
deep dust pool and simply vanishes. Some of the
rebels stop and try to get their comrade out; others
press more cautiously forward.

The rescuers are sitting targets, clearly identified as
rebels. The Travellers could take them out easily with
starship weapons. On the other hand they are trying
to prevent a comrade from meeting a horrible death.
The rebels will agree to a truce in order to attempt a
rescue and the vehicles pushing across the crater are
only too glad to retreat in this case. There are some
defenders on the far wall of the crater who will have to
be persuaded to hold their fire but if this can be done
it could be extended to an agreement that the Irkhar
Crater will not be used as a route of advance.

If the Travellers join the rescue attempt, they might try
lowering someone on a line from their ship. The buggy
driver can be found by feeling the vibrations of his
panicked attempts to struggle through the dust or using
advanced sensors in a creative manner. Visibility in the
dust is zero but once the driver is found it should be
possible to get a line round him and lift him out.

The Travellers’ actions at the crater will not affect the
Victory DM; the route is unviable and the rebels will
fall back with casualties whatever the Travellers do.
However, blasting the rescuers will result in bitter
resentment among the rebels which may lead to later
troubles. If the Travellers passively assist, such as by
providing sensor data to the rescuers or talking them
through a return across the dangerous crater, at least
some rebels will be more favourably inclined towards
reconciliation. Active assistance involving some risk
may win the Travelers some unlikely friends.

BATTLE PHASE 3: MISSILES INCOMING!
The distant Ine Givar missile launchers are brought into
play. If the Travellers’ ship is high enough to be tracked
it will be engaged intermittently with missiles, likely with
no more success than previously. Missiles will also
be targeted on Medianne. Starship missiles are not
intended to be launched in a ballistic arc on a low-gravity
planet and are not very accurate in this role. However,
they are very destructive and a city is a big target.

Three salvoes are fired at the city during the battle,
each consisting of 1D missiles. Each missile that is not
intercepted makes a normal attack roll, with success
indicating it hit something and penetrated the city’s
micrometeorite armour. Misses come down between
building complexes or outside the city. They may cause
damage and casualties but are not sufficient to affect
the outcome of the battle.

Each missile that hits the city reduces Victory by -1; it
is possible that a missile salvo will produce an instant
surrender. The Travellers can engage the missile
salvoes or have AutoGunner do it. Each salvo is in
range for D3 starship combat rounds before impact
and each turret can engage one missile per round.
Other solutions are possible, ranging from improvised
electronic warfare to putting the Travellers’ ship in the
way of a missile. Such heroic actions will impress the
World Board greatly, if they survive, but run contrary
to the Travellers’ mission brief. A damaged ship will
be less impressive to clients encountered later in the
voyage, although the Travellers may be able to turn
that to advantage by presenting the story of how the
damage occurred in the right light.

##### The Bright Face

If the Travellers do not attempt to counter this threat
the Referee has two choices. If the attacks proceed
without interference, Victory will continue to drop.
If it reaches -10 the city surrenders. So be it; the
Travellers had a chance to alter the outcome and did
not. If the Referee prefers, the rebels may be very
short of missiles and stop their attacks after Victory
reaches -6 or so. In this case they are assumed to
be holding their last missiles in reserve and may do
something with them later. This may be a revenge
attack or a shot at the Travellers’ ship.

**BATTLE PHASE 4: FLANKING ATTACK**
As the chaotic battle around the ridge unfolds, a
force of rebels pushes through the rough ground on
the eastern flank. They are on foot and began their
endeavour as an attempt to slip around to engage
defender vehicles from an unexpected direction.
However, it became apparent that smaller vehicles
could be guided through the broken ground and a
snake of mining buggies is now entering the area
and will eventually emerge to make a dash for the
excavation site or the city itself.

There are some defenders positioned in the broken
area but not enough to stop the attack for long. Unless
the Travellers specifically watch the flank they are
unlikely to notice anything happening at first, but sooner
or later they will become aware of what is happening.
The World Board might ask for help, or the Travellers
may intercept signals from the embattled defenders.

What the Travellers do about this, if anything, is up to
them. The rear elements of the rebel force are easy to
identify and could be targeted with starship weapons.
This is like shooting fish in the proverbial barrel and
produces a precipitous retreat. The Travellers might
also try to bring down some of the rocks to create a
barrier. This will reduce casualties and may cut off the
personnel who are already through the broken ground.
Other options are possible, ranging from doing nothing
to flying up additional troops to assist the defenders or
getting down on the ground to join the defence.

If the Travellers do not intervene, the rebels break
through and are able to impede the defenders as
they fall back from the ridge. In this case Victory
is reduced by -2. Halting the attack with some
casualties, such as by blocking the advance
route with rubble, increases Victory by +1. Heavy
casualties, such as those caused by starship
weapons fired at personnel trapped in close terrain,
may inspire some rebels to harbour a bitter grudge.

BATTLE PHASE 5: COUNTERATTACK
The battle becomes a confused affair, with some
elements of both sides engaged in a running fight
from the ridge to the excavation facility. In the midst of
the chaos some of the defenders’ vehicles rally into a
coherent group and launch a determined counterattack.
Their small arms fire is effective against personnel
riding open mining buggies but does little damage
to heavier vehicles. Nonetheless, the counterattack
punches through towards the ridge. The Travellers may
note a factor in this conflict they had not recognised
before; some vehicles are pulling out of the fight with
little actual damage. A hail of bullets might do nothing
more than chip the windows of an ATV but it may be
enough to make the crew want to pull back. Some
vehicles are destroyed by grenades or caused to crash
but for the most part this is a battle of morale and
determination rather than firepower.

The counterattack begins well enough, with a couple
of enemy vehicles driven out of the fight and another
caused to crash, but soon it becomes bogged down.
One-by-one, the defenders’ vehicles are pummelled into
wrecks by rebel grenade attacks or forced to withdraw.
Amid the chaos of the counterattack, one of the ATVs
ends up on its side with injured personnel inside. It is
leaking air and broadcasting a distress call. Another
defender vehicle tries to return to assist but is driven off.

If the Travellers attempt a rescue they will have to get
four injured defenders out of an ATV which is lying on
its side in the middle of a battle. This might be quite a
challenge but would win the Travellers favour with the
World Board. During the rescue they come under fire
from a party of rebels including one with a grenade
launcher. The Travelers might fight back or try to
negotiate a truce. The Ine Givar operatives among the
rebels are vicious and dedicated but the rebels are
much more likely to be merciful.

If the Travellers do nothing to assist, the scene plays
out differently. A party of rebels abandons the fight and
clambers onto the ATV to drag their enemies to safety.
As they are bringing the last casualty out a guided
missile strikes the ATV, killing rescuers and victims
alike. The Travellers will be able to positively identify
the launching vehicle as a rebel-crewed one. This
incident does not affect Victory but it may increase the
level of bloodshed which is what the Ine Givar want.

BATTLE PHASE 6: THE EXCAVATION FACILITY
The excavation facility is the key to the defence. It is
targeted by rocket-propelled grenades and the odd
missile but is very solidly built and able to take a lot

##### The Bright Face



of hits. The defenders are at first rather liberal with
their ammunition but soon begin to run short. This
necessitates desperate supply runs out from the city.
The excavation plant is subjected to ground assaults
as well, with hand-to-hand fighting in places on the
ore conveyors.

It is recommended that each Traveller be given one
last chance to contribute to the defence of Medianne

- or the attack on it, if that suits their purposes. If there

are only two or three Travellers they may be given an
additional chance. If the Travellers are not inclined to
try some of the following options they can be used as
scenes by the Referee, indicating the ferocity of the
fighting without affecting the outcome of the battle.

A Traveller who attempts one of these options may make
an Average (8+) check using a relevant skill. Victory
is modified by the Effect. This assumes the Traveller’s
actions are plausible and relevant. The Referee should
give the Travellers some leeway here – a single rifle shot
can turn a battle depending on who it hits, so there is
room for both large-scale and small-scale actions.

GENERAL FIGHTING: Defenders shoot down at
enemy vehicles, trying to puncture tyres or shatter
windscreens, and have the occasional success.
Improvised bombs made from mining explosives are
hurled by defenders, whose aim is rather random.
Rebels take up positions of cover and shoot back
whilst their vehicles try to push on towards the city.
The situation is fluid until, suddenly, it is not – it will
change when the Referee determines the victors of
the battle. Within moments, it will be clear what the
outcome will be. Until that point, the general fighting
will be the backdrop to whatever the Travellers do.
Travellers who get stuck in during the general fighting
can use an appropriate weapon or other skill to
perform some noteworthy feat.

IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVES: The defenders could
turn the tide of the battle if they can suddenly inflict
heavy casualties on the rebels on break an assault that
otherwise looks likely to succeed. One possible gambit
would be to plant charges in such a way as to hurl a
shower of small rock fragments at enemy personnel.
This will also affect open buggies but cannot do much
harm to an ATV unless a larger charge is used. The
defenders might think of this or other gambits but it is
better if the Travellers come up with it themselves. They
might either plant the charges themselves or direct
someone to do so. Other explosive options include
dropping satchel charges onto enemy ATVs or reckless

actions such as using a vacc suit manoeuvring system
to fly in the low gravity to land on an enemy vehicle and
place the charge manually. Explosive antics naturally
use the Explosives skill.

DIRECTED FIRE: The defenders lack military
experience and are trying to disable enemy vehicles
with sheer firepower. If the Travellers can advise on
weak points or coordinate the fire of several defenders
they may obtain a better result. The Travellers could
use Tactics (military) or a weapon-related skill to direct a
group of defenders.

HAND-TO-HAND: The rebels are attempting to
storm the excavation plant, clearing defenders from
the gantries and ore conveyors. This is a scramble,
balancing on precarious footholds firing one-handed,
or a close combat with pistols, knives and tools. A
Traveller could make quite the difference defending or
clearing a key location. Vacc-suited brawling normally
uses the Melee skill.

CASEVAC: Less fighty Travellers might busy
themselves extracting casualties. This is risky and Ine
Givar operatives might choose to attack the medics
just to increase the overall level of hatred between
the factions. However, most personnel on both sides
will try to avoid harming obvious angels of mercy and
might actively protect them. Medical assistance and
casualty evacuation does not affect Victory but may
assist with reconciliation providing the Travellers are
making few distinctions. If they help only one side’s
wounded they will win favour from that faction but the
other may resent them for it.

LEADERSHIP AND TACTICAL GUIDANCE: The
Travellers will by now have realised how inexperienced
and generally inept both sides are. A Traveller willing
to get down among the fighting can use Leadership
to rally a group of friendlies or Tactics to direct them
effectively. Someone aboard a starship can offer
tactical guidance using the vessel’s sensors.

STEALTH AND SUBTLETY: If the Travellers can
identify leaders or Ine Givar operatives (even if they do
not know what they are as yet) they might eliminate a
few key figures. This might involve sniping or a sneaky
assassination after infiltrating the enemy. A suitable
check (a weapons-related skill or Stealth most likely)
imposes its Effect on Victory.

ELECTRONIC WARFARE AND PSYOPS:
Travellers can also affect the course of the battle
remotely. It may be possible to improvise some form

##### The Bright Face

of electronic warfare or interfere with the enemy’s
communications. Even just yelling randomly over the
enemy’s communications channel will disrupt their
command and control – such as it is. More subtle
psychological operations can be carried out by giving
false information or trying to undermine morale. That
can be done by just telling enemies they are going
to die but talented Travellers might be able to fake a
retreat or the sounds of a surrender.

**REFEREEING THE ENDGAME**
The last phase of the Battle for Medianne will likely
determine the fate of the world and the Travellers are
centre stage if they want to be. Some or all of them
might be aboard the ship, others on the ground. It
may be that the Travellers all take to the field and
use Autocrew to direct their ship, acting as missile
defence for Medianne.

The default option throughout all this is for the Referee
to describe a developing situation and the Travellers to
react to it. This can be as detailed as seems desirable;
some groups will want to play out a desperate knife
battle atop the excavation machinery, others will prefer
to make a skill check to determine the outcome of the
phase and move on. For some groups, the narrative
can go a step further. Providing the Travellers are not
too silly they can be permitted to narrate their actions
and the results based on the Effect of their check. This
can be phrased as an answer to the question; ‘what did
you do during the Battle of Medianne’.

_‘I was up on the excavator gantry, two rounds in my
rifle and a slow leak in my suit. Shot one hostile, batted
another off the conveyor with my rifle butt. Big guy
came at me with a heavy-duty rocksplitter drill. After
that things got kinda tough...’_

‘Me and Foxy were pulling survivors out of a wrecked
ATV. Some of the rebels spotted us... thought we were
in trouble but they righted a buggy for us to put the
wounded in and walked us out of the combat zone.
Hope those guys made it.’

‘I jammed enemy comms. As in, 45-minute blues jam with
an epic saxophone solo! Want me to sign your shirt?’

The Travellers can contribute to the battle according to
their nature and if they get into the spirit of the narrative
they will get to supply their own ideas. This can be used to
test the waters for the future – not all groups can handle
telling their own story, in which case a more conventional
incident-and-response model should be used.

###### THE FATE OF DINOM

At the climax of the battle for the excavation facility the
Referee should determine the outcome of the battle.
The system below is recommended but if desirable
it can be entirely disregarded in favour of whatever
outcome the Referee wants or feels to be appropriate.
If the Travellers’ actions were heroic but the dice hate
them, the Referee might decide their chosen side
won anyway. The default option is to use Victory as a
DM on a 2D check. If the Travellers took actions that
influenced Victory they may be able to swing the battle.

The outcome of this check determines the overall
situation. Even if they have taken Medianne the rebels
know that Rhylan will be harder to capture and are likely
to be dismayed by the level of casualties they have
suffered. The surviving members of the World Board, for
their part, are worried the rebels might succeed and do
not want to suffer further losses – financial or personnel.
They would be willing to send people to fight for distant
Medianne but combat on their doorstep with a prospect
of being captured does not appeal.

Victory Determination

2D + DMs Result
0 or less Total collapse of the defence. Areas of the city surrender or go over to the rebels before the leaders

city falls quickly, with minimal resistance remaining.
7–9 The defenders are pushed back, some making it into the city and some driven off in rout. Some
resistance continues.
10–12 The defenders are driven back into the city but retain control of most of it.
13–15 The rebel advance is halted, although barely. Medianne remains in the hands of the World Board.
16+ The rebel advance is broken. Their forces pull back leaving Medianne in the hands of the World Board.

##### The Bright Face



Thus as the battle for Medianne winds down, both sides
are willing to talk. A truce is declared, although there will
be incidents of violence from time-to-time. These will be
worse and more frequent if the Travellers took actions
that antagonised one side, such as shooting at people
who were trying to rescue casualties and the violence
will be mitigated if the Travellers were seen to be
merciful or if they eliminated many Ine Givar operatives.

The Ine Givar want a continuation of the conflict, ideally
ending in the establishment of an ostensibly democratic
Workers Council which they can influence to cause
trouble for the Imperium and perhaps eventually
secede. If they cannot achieve this then more
bloodshed suits their purposes. They will try to disrupt
negotiations and cause incidents if they can. The
Travellers might end up getting involved with finding out
who was responsible and hunting them down, or they
may prefer to leave it to the authorities.

If the Travellers want to stay and take part in the
negotiations they can, although they do have a mission
to complete. The Travellers’ ship might be the nearest
thing to a neutral place for discussions, although that
depends on their actions so far. Whichever side ends
up controlling Medianne has a huge advantage in the
negotiations but the outcome is by no means certain.
The most likely long-term situation is a sort of coalition
between the workers and the owners, in which the
World Board is expanded to include leaders from the
Workers Council and a percentage of profits will be
diverted to welfare funds and other projects designed
to improve quality of life. In this event, there will be
resistance from the remaining Ine Givar operatives and
a great deal of tension for years to come. There is no
guarantee Dinom will not see further violence.

If the workers and the World Board cannot come to
an agreement, a standoff develops with the workers
controlling Napan and the World Board in Rhylan.
Medianne will be a disputed area, ostensibly controlled
by one side or the other but subject to sabotage, rioting
and infiltration. Large-scale conflict is unlikely for some
time as both sides have taken heavy losses and neither
profits from further violence. If one faction does get the
idea it can win, renewed warfare is probable.

The fate of Medianne is a guide to the future of
Dinom – if the World Board retains control things
will eventually return to how they were, with some
concessions. If the city fell to the rebels, society
on Dinom will change considerably. This has
consequences for the Travellers. A World Board that
retains control may someday choose to buy starships
and will look favourably upon RVSC. A weakened
World Board will not be in a position to do so. In short,
the Travellers do not benefit financially from a rebel
victory and RVSC will not be pleased with them.

The Referee must determine the level of hatred
engendered by the conflict, using the Travellers’
actions and experiences as a guide. Bloodshed breeds
hatred, and hatred may lead to continued resistance or
atrocities. Reconciliation will take a long time in any case
but notable acts of mercy will help build bridges and
ultimately repair society. This will help indicate whether
the conflict sputters on or takes some other course. It
may be that the Travellers return to Dinom for further
adventures, perhaps rooting out Ine Givar operatives
or leading a resurgent worker rebellion in a drive on
Rhylan. There is a whole campaign to be played out on
this world, perhaps leading to the Travellers taking on
Arlent Streen for control of the planet. This is, however
beyond the scope of Whispers on the Abyss.

##### The Bright Face

After their adventure on Dinom, the Travellers still have a
mission to complete. The most important potential client
of the voyage is the government of Arden, eight parsecs
away. The quickest route is by way of Phlume, Rangent
and Pequan, taking advantage of the Travellers’ jump-2 range. However, there are no meetings scheduled
until Arden so the Travellers can go any way they want
and there is no reason the Travellers could not add
in additional stops. They will have to justify these to
the RVSC personnel aboard, which is likely to mean
demonstrating there is some prospect of showing off the
ship to someone who might want to buy one, or carrying
out some important errand along the way.

The Travellers might also want to bypass systems
where they anticipate difficulties. More than a couple
of additional stops will generate objections, forcing the
Travellers to come up with ever-better justifications
for their decisions. This part of the campaign is
freeform and may include additional adventures if the
Referee desires it. Profiles for other worlds along the
way are presented in the sections on the Vilis and
Lanth subsectors, starting on page 26. The incidents
associated with the worlds named below can be moved
elsewhere if the Travellers take a different route. They
do not need to be presented in any particular order.

###### PHLUME

Phlume is an agricultural world with a population of
about seven million. Its own technology is of the late
pre-starfaring era, which creates ideal conditions
for Imperial corporations to sell advanced goods at
lucrative prices to a population with enough money
to buy them in quantity. Phlume’s modest starport
sees considerable numbers of jump-1 trade ships out
of Extolay, some of which push on to Tionale before
turning around. Trade is brisk but cargo volumes small.
Relatively few vessels proceed to spinward; most
ships using the Spinward Main turn coreward towards
Regina. Phlume has seen a recent increase in vessels
flagged out of the so-called Federation of Arden,
including some formerly Imperial-registered ships.

# A CROSS THE BORDER

The orbital component of Phlume’s starport is little more
than a fuelling station, with all trade and recreation taking
place at the downport. The world has no system defence
forces of its own, so a standing deployment from the
subsector fleet is maintained, usually a destroyer plus
one or two escorts or patrol corvettes. Small as this
deployment might seem to the casual observer, it
absorbs multiple ships that could otherwise be useful
elsewhere. For every vessel on a standing deployment
another must be ready to replace it. Maintenance and
transit times must also be considered.

The Travellers have no meetings scheduled on
Phlume and may wish to simply refuel and move on.
An Imperial-registered ship headed outward is the
least likely of all passing vessels to be subject to a
search, so in all probability the Travellers will receive
an automated greeting and advisory that they are in a
border system. Whatever the Travellers decide to do
here they are around long enough to suffer another
of those strange sensor glitches. This time the data
comes together faster and indicates three ships.

Unless the Travellers attract attention they will not be
considered suspicious. They will be allowed to proceed
unimpeded but may be puzzled by the data they are
receiving about Imperial Navy vessels.

###### RANGENT

Rangent is almost entirely covered in seas, which are
farmed to provide the world’s only exports. A few small
cities exist on the available land masses and in shallow
water, from which huge factory-ships make long
cruises and submersibles tend the world’s extensive
aquaculture industry. There is no starport as such,
just landing sites on some of the larger islands where
seafood and seaweed products can be trans-shipped.
Smaller starships can land directly on the factory-ships
as they ply the world’s oceans, taking on cargo without
ever interacting with the world’s population. As a result,
the five million or so inhabitants are largely isolated
from the wider universe and uninterested in offworld
events. Almost the entire population is employed by the
Rangent Corporation, which provides a governmental
function but is first and foremost a commercial entity.

The Travellers will note that whilst there are a lot of
prospecting and mining vessels in the system, through
traffic is very low. It is also clear that someone has
been waiting for a passing ship. They are contacted on
a civilian band by someone named Jeffe Khalid, who
offers to pay over the odds for passage out of the system
as soon as possible. There are not alerts about a person
of that name and Jeffe explains that he has been stuck
here for weeks after a falling-out with the crew of a free
trader named Burnished Gold. There is a ship of that
name in the databases and inquiries do show it passed
through here a few times in the previous couple of years.

Jeffe was a crewmember aboard Burnished Gold , he
says, and hopes to get to a port – any port – where he
can find a ship to sign on with. He has some money and
is willing to pay over the odds for passage. He offers
Cr10000 for middle passage but can be bargained up
to Cr25000. All he wants is to get to a Class B or A port
with a decent amount of through traffic. If the Travellers
take him on, they will find Jeffe to be an unassuming
generally hassle-free passenger. He will even offer to do
jobs around the ship, as if he is trying to make himself
useful enough to be hired as crew.

###### PEQUAN

Pequan is a habitable world populated by around
seven million people. Its mid-tech society is ruled by
an oppressive dictatorship which maintains cool but
cordial relations with all local powers. Pequan does not
seem to favour one over another but has been the site
of in a series of incidents involving attacks on shipping
or harassment of trader crews on-planet. Some of

these incidents have led to periods of poor relations
with other worlds or interstellar polities but ultimately
Pequan’s dictator needs what little trade comes through
and cannot risk alienating too many ship operators.

The Pequan system possesses no gas giants and the
mainworld has only a landing area with no facilities.
This could make the system a barrier to jump-1 traffic
but, many decades ago, a group of entrepreneurs
solved the problem and began making good money into
the bargain. A fuelling station was set up orbiting one of
the system’s rockball planets, kept fed by small ships
collecting water ice from the system’s planetoid belts.
The station operators charge a premium for fuel. This
enables them to support their own fuel supply vessels
and even attract a few freelancers. Ice-mining is a
boring way to make a living but it is not difficult.

The Pequan fuel station was independent for over a
century but has recently been bought out by a group of
outside investors. It is an open secret they are based
out of Arden; the facility is slowly receiving a makeover
intended to remind all passing ships that the Federation
of Arden is real and present. Vessels registered out of
Arden are overcharged for fuel but not nearly as much
as non-Arden ships.

As the Travellers are refuelling, another ‘sensor glitch’
takes place. This one takes a little longer to resolve
than the previous few.

VESSEL IDENTITY: Unknown.
LOCATION: Orbiting Mainworld.
CONDITION: Operational. Weapons Unpowered.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: Not responding to

ANALYSIS: No analysis possible at this time.

The Chazhdr-class is a Zhodani light cruiser. This
example is only two jumps from Zhodani space and
has all manner of reasons to be present in a neutral
system. Cruisers from the Imperium and the Consulate
make ‘goodwill visits’ to neutral worlds as a means of
projecting what is known as soft power. The presence
of this vessel may alarm the Travellers but all it is doing
at present is conducting diplomacy.

What the Travellers cannot know at this point is that
other cruisers have moved into systems between Arden
and the Imperial border. Having a couple wandering
around the region showing the flag is normal but there
are far too many for this to be a normal operation. In
fact, these cruisers are scouts for the Zhodani battle
fleet and have a secondary purpose of intercepting
couriers or reconnaissance vessels bearing news of
an impending attack. Once the Imperial Navy collates
all reports of cruiser activity along the borders it will be
obvious something is happening, but these ships will be
able to deny the Imperials clear information on Zhodani
strength and movements for a time. The Travellers will
find out about this soon enough.

##### Accross the Border



###### JEFFE KHALID

Jeffe Khalid is a legend – legend in the sense that
the term is used for a cover identity in the intelligence
community. His real name is Karl Rashid – Lieutenant-Commander Karl Rashid, Imperial Navy. An honours
graduate of the Deneb naval academy, Karl served
for a time in the engineering department of various
warships but soon found his talents lay elsewhere. He
rapidly advanced through the ranks of the intelligence
service to become a coordinator and was assigned
to the field office at Arden. His job is supposed to
be analysis and data collation, not field work, but he
decided to personally check out rumours of strange
activity along the border. This is a violation of the rule
that senior operatives must not place themselves in
danger of capture but in the intelligence world rules can
be rather malleable.

Karl inserted himself as a crewmember on the
apparently legitimate free trader Burnished Gold but
became suspicious about the crew. He engineered an
argument and got himself dumped at the next port, and
has been trying to figure out how to get back to his field
office without attracting attention. He is also deeply
worried about ship movements along the border. He
has no solid evidence but the patterns are changing,
as if someone knows something is about to happen.
Factoring in all the rebellions and industrial troubles
going on at the moment and a Zhodani disruption
campaign seems likely. Karl does not think war is about
to break out but that is always a possibility.

If he can, Karl will quietly return to Arden and put
his suspicions in his regular report. It may be a little
late for that, however. He will prefer to remain on
Arden and feed information back to Imperial Naval
Intelligence if he can but if his identity is discovered
he and possibly other members of his staff will need
to get out quickly. Karl has no reason to suspect
the Travellers are anything other than a corporate
team sent to sell starships, although if he sees one
of the ‘sensor glitches’ he will recognise the system
and begin to wonder why the Travellers have it. This
could be a ‘crossed lines’ situation, with the Travellers
also working for the INI, or could be something more
complex or sinister. Karl will not reveal who he really
is or any insider knowledge unless he is certain the
Travellers can be trusted.

##### Accross the Border

Lying roughly midway between the borders of the Zhodani
Consulate and the Imperium, Arden has a unique role as
a conduit for trade and diplomacy, and is attempting to
leverage this to create a small interstellar polity. The idea
is presented in terms of a neutral buffer state which would
benefit both major powers but the obvious reality is that
Arden simply wants to become more powerful.

Arden was apparently settled during the Rule of Man
era – or perhaps even before its creation – by dissident
or exiled Vilani. The arrival of Imperial colonists in 290
added some new cultural influences to the mix and
today’s Ardenian society bears little resemblance to the
culture of the First or Second Imperium. Government
is theoretically at least a little democratic, with officials
elected by mass vote. However, candidates are all
drawn from the same elite segment of Arden’s society
so there is little difference between their views.

The ruling elite of Arden are all members of the
Arden Society, which is dedicated to maintaining
control over the homeworld and expanding influence
to other star systems. Society members control
businesses on nearby worlds and own a number of

private trade ships. They are particularly interested in
acquiring a shipbuilding capability and in advancing
Tech Level in general but in the interim are
expanding the world’s fleet of commercial vessels.
In addition, since Arden imposes tariffs on Imperial
vessels, many free traders are being encouraged to
use Arden as a flag of convenience.

The Travellers have an important meeting scheduled
at Arden. The Arden Society is interested in purchasing
multiple starships in order to expand its influence over
the surrounding systems. The obvious requirement
is for jump-1 traders but there is also a need for
vessels that can act as light escorts and patrol ships.
A fleet of refurbished Type R subsidised merchants
would be ideal and the Travellers should have had
a good chance to convince the authorities to begin
negotiations. However, events have taken a sharp turn.

Upon arriving in the Arden system, the Travellers
are greeted as normal by starport traffic control and
directed into an approach pattern. They may not be
paying much attention but sooner or later they will
notice something is not right. First of all, another
‘sensor glitch’ takes place. This is apparently triggered
by a transponder return from a large vessel close to
the orbital port. After a few seconds of jumbled data, a
clear readout emerges.

VESSEL IDENTITY: Dievledl.

CONDITION: OPERATIONAL: Weapons Unpowered.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: Responding to civilian

ANALYSIS: Vessel poses no threat. Goodwill visit
probable.

There is nothing suspicious about the presence of
a Zhodani cruiser at Arden. Both the Consulate and
the Imperium have courted Arden for many years,
whilst supposedly respecting its neutrality. Zhodani
ships are a common sight here and indeed Imperial
Naval Intelligence maintains a field office specifically
to observe passing Consulate vessels. However, the
Travellers will notice something odd about the local
traffic pattern... there is none.

Transponder pings produce responses from the usual
port utility craft and fighters out on patrol but there
are no vessels on an obvious out-to-jump heading. A
couple of what might be commercial craft are in orbit
or headed up and down around the highport but it
seems Arden starport is under some kind of lockdown.
The automated greeting from the port gives no
indication of an alert.

# E SCAPE FROM ARDEN

The Travellers’ sensor systems suddenly begin to go
berserk. Data floods the screens, gradually resolving
itself into readouts on dozens of craft. Most are small,
such as fighters and utility cutters. Some of these are
unusually far out, as if in position to intercept incoming
or outgoing vessels. There are a few system defence
boats, mostly of old Imperial designs, lurking with their
transponders off. There are also four ships positively
identified as Argacan multipurpose vessels. All are
positioned as if on patrol rather than engaging in
commercial activity. A force of six paramilitary vessels
of Vargr design are also in-system. Their transponders
are off but the Travellers’ ship can still identify them as
vessels belonging to the Zueng.

The Travellers should not have this data. Their
sensors should not be able to pick up fighters at such
a long range, nor to identify them individually without
a transponder response. If the Travellers investigate
they will find a signal buried in the system’s datanet
broadcasts. It is heavily encrypted but seems to be
coming from the highport. This signal is feeding their
ship data that has been gathered by the Imperial
Navy intelligence team at the highport... and their
ship is responding.

If Jeffe Khalid is on board and sees what is going
on, he recognises what has happened. This is a
supposedly covert data transfer from his field office and
the ship should not be responding. He will of course
want to know why the Travellers have an intelligence
package aboard their vessel but more urgently he
needs to know why their ship is now making an
immense data dump and what it is transmitting.

Attempts to shut off the data dump do not work. It might
be possible to isolate antennae and physically disable
comms but not quick enough to prevent the information
transfer. If the Travellers want to look at what they
are transmitting it is horrifying. Every ship they have
encountered has been logged and not just the ones
where they suffered a ‘glitch’. Older data includes
dispositions of the entire sector fleet reserve at Macene
as well as the vessels deployed at Jae Tellona and
Rhylanor. The system defence forces in these systems
are also laid out in glorious detail. Vessels which would
normally return nothing more than ‘Imperial Navy

Warship’ are named and identified, sometimes with
extensive notes on their history and known defects
or damage. The Travellers’ ship has just dumped the
biggest ‘pinch’ of data on the Imperial Navy’s Spinward
Marches Fleet ever stolen... but who received it?

The Travellers cannot know at this time but Jeffe
Khalid’s field team was compromised months ago. He
only avoided being captured by his ill-advised decision
to go into the field. Zhodani Naval Intelligence now
has information on Imperial defences. If Khalid knows
about any of this he will want to send a coded signal
asking if the team has been compromised. He will
receive an ‘everything normal’ response of course but
he remains suspicious.

If the Travellers try to talk to traffic control they receive
a vague response about a ‘temporary traffic lockdown’
resulting from ‘possible pirate activity’. This is vaguely
plausible but unlikely. Traffic control will talk with the
Travellers, asking them to head to the highport quickly
and avoid sudden changes of course. All vessels will
be searched once landed, as a precaution due to the
presence of suspected pirates. The port authority
expects to have traffic moving in a few hours.

By now the Travellers are likely to be smelling the
proverbial rat. Their suspicions will be confirmed
when their ship suddenly goes into security lockdown.
This is based upon the return-to-port system built
into Autocrew but it has been modified. Not even
Joachim can over-ride it. The ship veers off course,
now headed for a remote landing area on Arden
itself. As the Travellers are fighting to get back into
their systems, they receive a signal from the Zhodani
cruiser. The signal informs the Travellers their ship
is being seized as a suspected spy vessel. If they
do not resist they will be released unharmed after
questioning but their ship will be interned.

If the Travellers do nothing, the Zhodani will keep
their word. The ship will auto-land in a remote area
and be boarded by Consular Marines. They do not
answer questions and will not tolerate interference in
their mission but they are not really interested in the
Travellers themselves nor any of the crew. Khalid is
a person of interest to them, so he will be taken away
for interrogation but the Travellers will be asked a few
questions about their ship and mission then released.
The ship itself is quickly taken over by a Zhodani prize
crew who have overrides for the return-to-port system.
It is last seen headed out of the system on a jump
vector for Consulate space.

The Travellers will find themselves on Arden with
only their personal effects and whatever funds they
have. They will be watched but are not imprisoned,
suggesting there is more to this matter than meets
the eye. There is; the Zhodani were expecting a ship
with the intelligence package aboard and know the
crew are innocent dupes. The Imperials might not be
so sure, but that is a problem for another day. The
Travellers will witness the arrival of the lead elements
of the Zhodani war fleet over Arden and the official
recognition of the Federation of Arden by the Zhodani
Consulate. These are significant events but the
Travellers might do well to avoid them.

###### REGAINING CONTROL

The return-to-port system has been compromised.
Even if the Travellers thought they had disabled
Autocrew, the Travellers will find it has been embedded
secretly in control systems. Rooting it out is quite a job,
requiring finding code hidden within code or disabling a
number of systems and using others to take over their
function. The override could be removed given enough
time but the Travellers do not have that luxury. There
are, however, other options.

Joachim cannot help much in terms of the actual
programming but his high-level override could be
used to conflict the system. Combined with spurious
and confusing inputs, the Travellers might use this
to cause some elements of the imposed override
to produce errors and ultimately crash. Ironically
perhaps, the glitches with AutoEngineer might also
interfere with the override code.

The Travellers will need to come up with at least
three different methods of confusing the system.
AutoEngineer’s malfunctioning mathematics is one,
Joachim’s commands are another. Other options
include deliberate input of confusing data, requiring
an Electronics (computers) check or disabling some of
the systems that interact with the vessel’s command
and control programming. Physically disconnecting
or smashing parts of the computer at random might
actually work, as the automated rerouting of functions
will add an additional layer of confusion.

The other, rather radical, option is a Very Hard
Reboot. This means cutting power to the ship’s
avionics and flight systems for a few minutes – turning
it off and on again. If done in flight this has the same
effect as confusing the control systems – the ship
loses all control and begins to fall out of the sky. All
is not lost at this point. Minimal emergency control
systems come online after a few seconds, which are

##### Escape from Arden



separate from the main flight package and free from
interference. They are also not very good, imposing
DM-2 on Pilot checks. There is in addition the non-trivial fact that the ship’s lifters and drive have no
power whilst the system is down.

The pilot will have to rely on the rather small amount
of lift produced by Arden’s thin atmosphere and use
the vessel’s aerofins to direct its fall into a controlled
descent. The ship will begin to spin as it descends
towards the Envain Mountains. On the plus side the
Travellers will go off the radar when they get low
enough, but impact with the ground seconds later
makes that a small triumph.

To correct the spin and set up a dead-stick descent the
pilot must succeed in a Difficult (10+) Pilot check, with
the DM for minimal controls as noted. Three attempts
are possible before impact and time to impact is
increased by the Effect of a successful check. Without
help this is unlikely but other Travellers can assist
depending on their skills.

ENGINEER: There is no power to the lifters and
drive but that does not mean no thrust is available.
Gravitational induction and field-collapse hysteresis
in the lifter system means that a falling ship actually
generates a little power which can be used for a burst
of thrust. A successful Average (8+) Engineer check
allows the engineer to make this available to the pilot
for a few seconds. The Effect of this check can be
added to the Pilot check each round.

SCIENCE, NAVIGATION, SURVIVAL: Travellers
likely to know about wind conditions and weather may
be able to predict a wind-tunnel effect in the Greyrock
Valley, which runs for much of the length of the
mountain chain. Using updraughts from the mountains
and increased airflow in the valley might provide a little
more lift. The Effect of a successful Average (8+) check
can be added to the Pilot check that round.

OTHER GOOD IDEAS: If the Travellers can produce
other good ideas and a check to go with them they can
help out. Diverting stored power from the life support
reserve or some other rather desperate measure might
help but creative Travellers should be rewarded. If the
margin between crashing and escape is an inspirational
saxophone solo then it is up to the Referee to decide if
it should be allowed.

The delay in impact buys time for the Travellers to clear
their system. A brute-force power reboot succeeds
on 8+ on a straight 2D check. This can be attempted

each round instead of an attempt to crash the control
system. The latter requires a Difficult (10+) Electronics (computers) check. If either succeeds the Travellers
have control of their ship once more. The override code
will have to be removed from the system somehow but
that can wait until they have escaped.

###### STRANDED ON ARDEN?

With control restored the Travellers find themselves
hurtling along the Greyrock Valley, off the radar for a
moment, and able to begin their climb to orbit. Their
problems are not over, however. As they begin their
ascent, jump flashes indicate the arrival of ships...
lots of ships. These openly identify themselves
as warships of the Zhodani Consulate. This is no
goodwill visit by a cruiser; these are battle squadrons
centred on a powerful capital ship, with supporting
cruisers and destroyers.

A blanket transmission orders all Imperial ships to
stand down and be interned, then a rather more
formal declaration indicates the Federation of Arden is
hereby recognised as a neutral interstellar power by
the Zhodani Consulate. If the Federation was a pipe
dream before, it is now reality. This is a significant
moment in history just for that but it is also the
opening of the Fifth Frontier War. The Zhodani are
beginning with a significant advantage given to them –
albeit unwittingly – by the Travellers.

If the Travellers do not manage to restore control they
have one chance at survival – turn the return-to-port
system back on and let it get them out of trouble. They
will find themselves stranded on Arden once their ship
has been interned of course but may be able to leave
peacefully. Arden is, after all, neutral territory and the
Travellers are still free sophonts. This is not as simple as
obtaining passage on a ship, if there are any leaving in
the near future. The Travellers will have to slog through
Arden’s notoriously torturous bureaucracy to obtain their
exit visas... and the ship they leave aboard may be a
General Products Argacan! That is a story for another day.

###### ESCAPE FROM ARDEN

The Travellers have a narrow window to escape. The
Zhodani fleet jumped short of the planet to allow its
considerable number of ships to assemble. There are
a few fighters and Zueng ships near the mainworld,
plus some system defence boats and four Argacan

giant or cracking ice off an asteroid. The Travellers are
off the radar and the situation is fluid at present, so they
have a decent chance.

If the Travellers seek to slip away under low power their
best option is to lay in a course to coast past the fighter
cordon with everything turned right down. This will keep
their emissions from being detected unless they are
very unlucky but it is slow and nerve-wracking. The first
stage of this stealthy escape is to prevent their ship’s
transponder from giving them away.

Civilian ships have three transponder settings,
though most run permanently in Active mode. With
an Active transponder a ship broadcasts its identity
and heading every few seconds. This enables
installations and other ships to plot the progress of
vessels and ensure there are no dangerous close
passes. The transponder will also ‘ping’ every few
seconds, emitting an interrogative signal that requests
transponders in Passive mode to respond.

In Passive mode the ship does not broadcast its
position or identity but will respond when ‘pinged’ by
another transponder. Passive mode is not commonly
used in high-traffic systems and looks a little suspicious
but in areas where pirate attack is a threat it can be
useful not to be noticed. To obtain information from a
vessel in Passive mode, a ship has to first reveal its
own presence, identity and basic information.

The third mode is Covert, in which a ship does not
respond to transponder pings at all. This is useful when
trying to hide but is considered highly suspicious by most
navies. In peacetime a vessel that does not respond
to pings is likely to be investigated. Under the present
conditions it is entirely possible it will be attacked.

With their transponder in Covert mode the Travellers will
only be detected by their ship’s emissions. By turning
off as much as they can and operating the drive under
low power the Travellers may be able to coast past the
patrols. Setting up a minimum-power orbit break requires
an Average (8+) Astrogation or Pilot check. Once in
motion there is little the Travellers can do but wait... and
that will be harder for some than others.

One or another of the RVSC personnel may not be able
to stand the strain. It is one thing to act in desperation
and quite another to sit quietly whilst sensor emissions
probe for the Travellers’ ship. A panicking crewmember
might do something very unwise, such as ordering
AutoGunner to power up the weapons and lock them
onto a nearby Arden fighter. This will greatly increase
the chance of detection.

Providing nobody does anything too stupid or swift
corrective action is taken, the Travellers should be
able to drift past the cordon and get far enough away
to avoid detection. They can then change course to
find a suitable fuel source. Gas giant skimming is
not an option, meaning the Travellers will have to
find an icy asteroid or perhaps find ice on one of the
outsystem rockball planets.

###### ONE LAST PROBLEM

If the Referee thinks the Travellers have suffered
enough they may be able to quietly slip out of the Arden
system and escape. However, there is one last problem
for those who can handle it. One of the Argacan-class
vessels purchased by Arden picked up a faint trace of
their emissions and has begun looking for them. The
Zhodani fleet is quite distant, the Zueng ships are busy
provisioning or fuelling and the Travellers are out of
range of the starport’s fighters. This will be a simple
confrontation between two vessels, if it happens at all.

Details for the Argacan are on page 114. The crew
are new and still in the process of familiarising
themselves with the design. Their skills can be
assumed to give DM+1 on all tasks. The Travellers’
ship is faster but the Argacan is bigger and more
heavily armed. It is possible that the Argacan will
be detected whilst it is searching for the Travellers’
ship. If so, they may have to hurriedly complete
refuelling operations and make ready. If they are still
undetected, they might try to slip away. That might
lead to a long-range duel as the Travellers try to
reach a jump point, or they might escape scot-free.
Alternatively, the Travellers might try to ambush their
opponent. A straight fight is also a possibility.

The Referee should present this last problem as a
campaign finale. Some Traveller groups will want a
dramatic victory over that ship that annoyed them
so much at the beginning of the campaign. It is not
the same one but might still provide catharsis. Other
groups might enjoy the subtle victory of slipping away
leaving the frustrated Arden crew scanning every rock
in the system looking for them. In short, the Referee
should use this incident to provide the Travellers with
a clear sense of triumph. Their mission has not gone
as planned, and they are in a war zone, but at least
they can win this fight.

###### MISSION INCOMPLETE

Once the Travellers have dealt with the pursuing ship,
one way or another, they are clear to escape and ponder
recent events. RVSC had expected the mission to end

##### Escape from Arden



with a sales pitch at Arden and maybe some opportunistic
sales attempts on the homeward cruise. Instead, a
full-blown interstellar war has broken out. This may
create opportunities as well as problems for a starship
conversion yard and it will certainly confuse the situation.
Orders that might have materialised as a result of the
cruise may now be deferred or cancelled. On the other
hand, there may be a sudden need for additional naval
auxiliaries or escort vessels operated by shipping lines.

The starship marketplace has been turned upside down
but business will continue. The Travellers might get a
fat bonus in three, five or even ten years’ time if a client
makes orders based on their efforts, but in the short
term the project has been derailed. RVSC will pay the
scheduled bonuses for interest in their ships resulting
from the cruise – that is only fair – and promises to
honour the bonus scheme if sales result, assuming of
course the Zhodani do not overrun the sector. In the
meantime, the Travellers are offered continued use
of the prototype so long as they stay in the Spinward
Marches and continue to showcase its capabilities. Any
sales that can be traced to the Travellers’ actions will
be grounds for a bonus.

The Travellers have not been given ownership of the
vessel, although at some point they might be. Instead,
they can use it as they please, more or less. The
AutoPurser wipes all company funds from the ship’s
system – basically setting up a transfer through the
courier system that will eventually put the funds into
RVSC’s coffers. To replace these funds the system sets
up an interest-free loan of MCr1. The Travellers can
use this money how they please, which will no doubt
include upkeep of the vessel. They can speculate it,
invest it or spend it on shoes if they like, but it has to
repaid someday. Wise Travellers will use this as seed
money to make more or to keep their ship flying.

This of course assumes the Travellers return to Imperial
space and try to settle with RVSC. With the overrides
disabled they can do as they will, although the RVSC
people will want to go home unless they have become
very good friends with the Travellers. The ship is
likely to be posted ‘missing, presumed lost’ given the
circumstances, so the Travellers could probably continue
to operate it for some time before having to admit they
are still alive. In this case AutoPurser will stop paying the
Travellers and handling expenses 10 weeks after leaving
Arden. The Travellers will find themselves with a ship
but zero money. Still, a good, fast ship can always turn a
profit somehow. There will surely be many opportunities
in the turbulent times to come.

There is also the question of the intelligence package.
Imperial Naval Intelligence still does not know the
Travellers have it. If they found out they would try to
take it back and would view Travellers who did not
immediately try to return it as soon as it was discovered
as highly suspect at best. Alternatively, if the Travellers
seem amenable, they might be tasked with doing some
covert intelligence-gathering on behalf of the Imperial
Navy. Those who were involved in getting the device
aboard the prototype know it is there and will want to
reclaim it. The Travellers might do a deal if they are so
inclined, or may end up on the run from everyone who
wants the device. What they do about this is their choice.

As to the payable bonuses, they are summarised on
the Bonus Payments table, applicable to each Traveller.

The Travellers have witnessed the outbreak of the Fifth

of opportunities, and have gained a number of useful
contacts. What they do next is entirely up to them. They
could, of course, run far away and wait for the shooting
to stop but that means missing the chance to be
centre stage in great events that will alter the course of
history. Indeed, if the Travellers remain in the Spinward
Marches they might be able to influence the fate of
worlds or even the outcome of the war itself.

# E AND WEAPONRY

#### QUIPMENT

A range of equipment is available to
the Travellers and their associates in
the course of this campaign. Much of
it is standard and the Travellers will
undoubtedly have their own kit. The
items presented here vary a little from
the standard version.

RVSC has a dress uniform, like many corporations.
It is somewhere between a military uniform and
a business suit, consisting of a double-breasted
jacket with vestigial epaulettes. Management-level
personnel wear an aiguilette on the right shoulder
and all personnel have a military-style ‘fruit salad’
with award ribbons for long or exceptional service.
The corporation permits ribbons from other services
to be worn in this display, which is taking a liberty in
the eyes of many other observers. The corporation
justifies this by referring to the ancient practice of
allowing police personnel who were military veterans
to wear their ribbons on duty uniform.

The jacket is in very dark grey, as is the associated
legwear. By tradition, personnel may wear trousers
or a long skirt, or a kilt in the company tartan. This
is completely made-up of course but features on a
great many items of merchandise. A waistcoat in
dark grey or company tartan is worn, with a white

shirt or blouse. This uniform is for formal occasions
and can be toned down to normal business-casual
by removing the waistcoat and switching to a single-breasted jacket.

Most personnel are issued a formal dress uniform at
regular intervals or upon submitting a valid request
for replacement. Those who may be operating in
questionable circumstances will be supplied with a
second, almost identical uniform incorporating light
personal armour. The epaulettes are designed to
protect the collarbone from a downward blow, with
slash-proof material over resilient core, whilst the jacket
provides Protection +2 without appearing any different
to a standard suit jacket. The waistcoat is a little more
bulky than standard and some users prefer to wear the
ordinary one under most circumstances. It is sufficient
to provide Protection +4. The jacket and waistcoat
together provide Protection +6.

The ‘tactical’ version of the suit also incorporates
provision for a concealed holster for a small handgun,
with space for two spare magazines, although this is
not usually worn by executives, and a dispenser at the
belt for two ‘escape grenades’. Typically one flash and
one noise grenade are carried. It is unusual to need this
sort of security equipment but RVSC has suffered the
occasional kidnap attempt on high-ranking personnel
and has been known to do business on worlds with
rather loose law enforcement. Any management-level
personnel visiting a world outside the Imperial border are
issued with the tactical version of the company uniform
as a matter of course. This includes the Travellers.

For working dress aboard ship, RVSC issues coveralls
of slightly above-average quality, bearing the insignia
of the company on the sleeves and left breast. These
are paired with a fluorescent orange sleeveless
jerkin with many pockets and a tool belt. These only
vary from the norm in that the jerkin has a ‘glow’
feature which can be triggered at need and there is
an emergency siren and radio beacon built into the
tool belt. The company has a very slick employee
safety film which is mandatory viewing – more about
demonstrating how much the company cares about
keeping its people safe than reminding them
not to wander away from the ship in a dust
storm and to Joachim Krystalfuchs’ eternal
embarrassment he has a starring role.

The company also provides a vacc suit and
expects all mission personnel to use it in
preference to their own. This does not matter all
that much if they are not observed by outsiders but
RVSC wants to maintain a corporate image and get its
brand into every mission log and routine surveillance
video. The vacc suit is of good quality and entirely
suitable for its role but it is a little lighter and easier to
move in than a standard TL12 design. This is mainly
so that RVSC personnel look good when operating in
their suits and comes at the price of reduced armour.
The suits are entirely as good as standard ones in
terms of environmental protection.

##### Equipment and Weaponry

RVSC issue weaponry with its own logo. Most
weapons are standard, differing only in appearance
from those on sale at most starport weapons
outlets. However, the firm does make use of some
less common weaponry. None of these items are
exclusive to RVSC; they are bought in bulk and
modified to the company’s appearance specifications
but are available elsewhere.

**SMALL ARMS**
The standard handgun used by RVSC is manufactured
by The Smallarms Company of Deneb, or SCD. SCD
sells primarily to government and corporate clients
and operates in the security rather than military sector.
Its weaponry is often found aboard starships or in
the hands of starport security teams. Some items are
also popular with law enforcement agencies, although
the Imperial Ministry of Justice trialled and rejected a
number of personal weapons a decade ago.

The S8 (for ‘Shipboard Eight’) is issued as standard
for security personnel and as an emergency gun
in shipboard lockers. It is built around an 8x20mm
cartridge, throwing a relatively small bullet at high
velocity. Standard ‘ball’ rounds claim slightly superior
performance to the industry-standard 9x19mm handgun
but with a price tag to match. Low-penetration ‘security’
rounds are also available. These are made from tough
but slightly flexible polymer, flattening on impact rather
than punching a hole in solid material. This slightly
improves knockdown against unarmoured targets but
is all but useless against objects and body armour.
Security rounds are generally carried aboard ship to
avoid endangering critical components and to reduce
the danger from ricochets.

The S8 has trigger, grip and magazine safety devices
but no manual safety. The weapon can be carried un-cocked with a round in the chamber, with no chance

of an accidental discharge and brought into action
immediately using a double-action trigger pull. After
this, function is normal for a semi-automatic pistol. An
ambidextrous de-cocking lever lowers the hammer
to the safe position. Standard magazines contain 18
rounds, plus one in the chamber.

A smaller version, designated C8 (for ‘Compact Eight’)
is issued to management-level personnel who are
going in harm’s way and to anyone who might need a
concealable weapon such as bodyguards at a formal
occasion. The C8 is in no way a ‘body pistol’ – it is
made from standard materials and is simply smaller
and slimmer. The C8 can take an S8 magazine but
it sticks out the bottom of the magazine well and
prevents the weapon from being holstered. An 8-round
magazine is more commonly used, which is not
compatible with the larger S8.

For more serious situations, the company issues a laser
carbine which bears the corporation logo but is otherwise
standard. In between the two is a smoothbore longarm
designated SCD-Guardian. This is a short shotgun-like
weapon with a three-shell magazine under the barrel.
It can be carried safely with a shell in the chamber,
giving four rapid shots. Chambered for a 14mm shell,
the Guardian is light by shotgun standards and can fulfil
multiple roles. The semi-automatic action is arguably
one of the fastest and smoothest on the market, with a
cut-off to allow a shell of a different type to be inserted
into the breech. Guardians are normally stowed with
the chamber empty to allow the first shot to be tailored
to the present need. A folding stock is fitted but can be
removed if desired.

‘Standard shot’ ammunition is used for human-sized
targets. It performs poorly against armour but is not
likely to ricochet or penetrate control pathways. ‘Light
shot’ is the most common shell actually fired, however.
It contains larger numbers of very small pellets, making
it ideal for small, fast targets like vermin or to injure
rather than kill human-sized opponents.

ESCAPE GRENADES


Escape grenades are small metallic cylinders not
unlike certain data storage devices – this resemblance
is intentional. Once activated, they are triggered by

sharp impact. Striking one or slamming it down on a
desk will suffice, although this is inadvisable as the
grenade will do 1D damage to anyone holding it when
it goes off. More commonly, they are flung against
the wall or floor as an executive’s bodyguards bundle
them away from danger.

There are three types of grenade available; flash, noise
and glitter. Flash grenades emit a bright flash which
will dazzle anyone not prepared for it. It is not enough
to completely blind someone but will cause a flinch
and some lingering pain which may slow a response.
Unless there is some reason why it is not pure chance

- such as someone realising what is about to happen

and looking away – roll 2D. On 11–12 the victim was
looking right at the flash and suffers DM-6 on all vision-based actions. There is a 50% (1–3 on 1D) chance the
penalty is reduced by 1 each round thereafter until it
reaches zero. On 5–10, the flash was in the subject’s
field of view and the DM starts at -2. On 2–4, the target
was looking elsewhere or averted their gaze in time
and suffers no penalty.

Noise grenades make a huge bang and have a
slight concussive effect. Everyone exposed must
make an Average (8+) END check, or be stunned
for a number of rounds equal to the negative Effect.
Anyone expecting the bang gains DM+4 for this check.
Regardless of the outcome, anyone without protection (such as ear defenders or a sealed armour suit) suffers
DM-2 the following round on all checks. This includes
the user’s allies but that is often considered acceptable
if it buys time for an extraction.

Glitter grenades are more accurately named defensive
optical scatter devices but are almost universally
referred to as glitter bombs. A tiny bursting charge
throws up a cloud of refractory microfragments
sufficient to affect a three metre cubed space. The
cloud will settle in 2D rounds and can be dispersed
quicker by fans or wind. In the meantime it makes any
form of optical sighting harder, obscures optical and
thermal cameras, and reduces the damage caused by
lasers by 2D. DM-2 applies to optical sighting and DM-4
to any form of intense light such as lasers or focused
flashlights. The effect is also highly dramatic, creating
a fabulous rainbow of ever-changing sparkles. These
grenades are misused on a frequent basis, despite dire
warnings from the company.

##### Equipment and Weaponry

The support weapons used by the rebels in the battle
for Dinom are either improvised from mining equipment
or brought in from offworld. Similar equipment can be
encountered on other worlds, with slight local variations.

60mm Rocket-Propelled Grenade
Generally known as an RP-60, this weapon is a
standard design used by many planetary armed
forces as well as insurgent groups. There are
branded and trademarked versions, and crude
copies knocked up in cave workshops. The ones on
Dinom are somewhere in between; a mix of grenades
smuggled in and others made in secret workshops
using mining explosives.

The warhead section is cone-shaped, with a pre-fragmented case and a hard penetrator tip. On a direct
hit this allows the warhead to punch into light vehicles
before detonating, although it performs poorly against
armoured vehicles. The warhead is a combination of a
shaped charge and fragmentation, as is typical of high-explosive dual-purpose (HEDP) weapons.

Propulsion is by way of a small rocket motor in the
base of the warhead section, using offset vents to
create spin. The weapon is extremely simple, with
no guidance system and no electronics to detect
or jam. Effective direct-fire range is 250 metres,
although the weapon will travel further. In normal
gravity these weapons have a range of around one
kilometre, but on a world like Dinom they can be
fired in a high arc to come down 10 kilomatres or
more away. Accuracy is minimal at this distance,
making rocket propelled grenades suitable only for
harassing urban areas at random. At 250 metres
or less there is a respectable chance of a hit on a
moving vehicle even just using a basic optical sight.

60mm RAM Grenade Launcher
The standard launcher for an RP-60 is a reusable
tube with a basic optical sight, fed from a rotating
two-shot ammunition canister. Canisters can be
reused but reloading involves replacing blow-out panels at the rear in a workshop. Swapping
a second projectile into place is a Minor Action;
replacing a canister is a Major Action.

60mm Bombardment Cluster
The bombardment cluster is a set of four container/
launchers positioned at varying angles and attached
to the side of a vehicle. Weapons are launched in
an arc to impact at a distance pre-set by the angle
of the launchers. This is affected by inclined ground,
of course, enabling some control over where the
projectiles come down. Aiming is accomplished
by pointing the whole vehicle, making the process
rather imprecise. These weapons are normally set
for a 300–500 metre range and suffer DM-6 on
attempts to attack a target smaller than a city block.
An app is available for download to a vehicle’s
navigation system which provides an estimated
impact point and reduces the DM to -2. There is no
legitimate civilian use of this app, making it illegal
in most areas and potentially proof of involvement
in an insurgency. All projectiles are launched in a
single salvo, although a vehicle could have more
than one cluster mounted on it.

##### Equipment and Weaponry



100mm Anti-armour Missile
Typically known as an AT-100, this standard
weapon is manufactured on many worlds and is
simple enough to throw together in a field workshop
providing basic electronics components and
explosives are available. It consists of a disposable
launcher/container with a basic electronic sight. The
latter combines optical and thermal detection in a
manner that would be expensive and impressive on a
mid-tech world but is dirt cheap at TL10. Once locked
onto a target, a process taking 1-3 combat rounds
depending on range, movement and visibility, the
weapon will self-guide.

These weapons are intended to take out mid-tech
armoured vehicles and lighter vehicles of all Tech
Levels, including grav craft. However, they can engage
spacecraft if they are low enough. DM+2 applies as
usual when targeting a space vessel with a ground-based weapon but damage is reduced to a tenth.

Mining Laser
Mining lasers are intended for intense focus at very
short distances and are not particularly effective as
weapons without modification. By adding additional
beam collimation equipment and altering the focus
point it is possible to create a weapon with an
effective range of up to 500 metres. Focus is rapidly
lost beyond this distance. Traverse and elevation
mechanisms can be created by altering the mining
mount but these devices are intended for blasting
rock at a distance of a few metres and are not at all
precise when used against anything smaller than a
building. Mining lasers do damage on the ground
scale and suffer DM-2 to attack rolls.

10mm ‘Guardian Compact’ Submachinegun
The 10mm ‘Guardian Compact’ submachineguns
used by Sir Hamex’ bodyguards are a standard
design manufactured by Instellarms and a few
licensees. Expensive for their type, they are well
made but command a high price mainly for their
connections with high-end security. Layout is
conventional, with a magazine inserted through the
handgrip. Usually a 12-round carry magazine is used,
allowing the weapon to be holstered like a handgun.
Users typically carry a spare 12-round magazine and
two 26-round extension magazines which project
from the bottom of the weapon. First shot is double-action, after which conventional semi-automatic or
full-automatic fire continues. The usual ammunition
choice is designed for maximum stopping power
rather than penetration and to avoid ricochets. When
operating in a more open environment, standard ball
rounds are commonly used.

Assault Carbines
The assault carbines issued to the Dinom security
service are a shorter and lighter version of a standard
weapon produced on many worlds. Chambered for
a 5x40mm round, these are bullpup configuration
weapons loaded through the fixed stock from a
detachable magazine. With a shortened barrel and a
vertical foregrip they are well suited to operations in
urban terrain.

Laser Weapon
The laser weapon in an attaché case used by Arlent
Streen’s bodyguard is a common security device. The
handle of the case has a catch which releases the
weapon and at the same time deploys light armour
panels which fold out under their own weight. The
result is a personal shield which can be held up by the
handle, covering a 40x100 centimetre rectangle. The
shield is awkward to use and not much use against
melee attacks but it will get in the way of bullets and
provide some protection. This can vary and should
be determined by 1D+2 each time the shield is hit.
The laser weapon is an oversized pistol with a large-capacity powerpack. Similar guns are available without
the case; those bought without the case cost Cr4500.

##### Equipment and Weaponry



Starships, along with transportation systems and
structures built in hostile environments such as
airless worlds, are required to carry an adequate
quantity of protective equipment. The simplest of
these are survival shelters, otherwise known as
depressurisation refuges, emergency blisters and
a variety of other terms. A survival shelter is fixed
in place, inflating to create a hemispherical refuge
which will usually be fed from the vessel or building’s
life support system if it is functional and from bottled
air if not. Zips are used to allow access and are not
completely airtight but will suffice for a short time.
Most blisters have small second chamber that can be
used as an airlock by rescue personnel.

Rescue balls are designed to inflate into a complete
sphere, remaining tethered to their deployment point
until deliberately detached. They are spherical and can

be propelled by a person inside walking ‘up’ the side
in the desired direction. The user can pick up objects
or manipulate tools and controls using a glove/sleeve
which covers the forearm.

Softsuits are short-term temporary vacc suits, with
a soft transparent helmet and an air bottle on a belt
clip. Another pocket contains a rather basic multitool
and a set of chemical lightsticks. Softsuits are
rather flimsy and come in what is described as ‘one
size fits nobody’, with adjustable panels. They can
accommodate most humanoids but vessels intended
for other body types may not have enough of them.
A softsuit is intended for survival, allowing the user
to get to a safe area or be rescued. They are not
suitable for long-term use and provide no protection
against damage or radiation.

Two starship designs feature in this mini-campaign, both produced by General Products.

### STARSHIPS

Manufactured by General Products, the _Argacan_ is
a new market entry which has thus far found little
favour. The general concept is good enough but
General has of late suffered a number of blows to
its reputation in the shipbuilding sector. The most
notorious of these is the Kinunir ‘vanguard cruiser’,
essentially a large escort or small patrol ship but
hyped as the answer to all manner of security
problems. General Products has a reputation for
adequacy which it sought to throw off with ambitious
projects like the Kinunir. After this failure, the firm
has returned to its roots and is trying to bring to
market a range of inexpensive but reliable craft and
vessels. The _Argacan_ is among them.

Conceived as a multipurpose naval auxiliary which
can carry out light patrol work or even act as an
escort for civilian traffic, the _Argacan_ tried to be
all things to everyone at a budget price. It is not
especially cheap for a rugged 600-ton vessel but
represents good value as an investment for a client
who might need to swap ships from commercial to
security work or who prefers not to have to assign
escorts to vulnerable auxiliaries. Target clients of
course included the Imperial Navy, since that is
where the big budget Credits are found but thus far
sales have been limited to planetary governments
and the occasional shipping line that perceives a
need for such a vessel.

The _Argacan_ is designed for efficiency of cargo
space rather than appearance or elegance of
function. Fuel tankage and cargo occupy the lower
deck, which is roughly rectangular. Above, it has
a smaller and narrower upper deck, widening aft
to house the power and drive systems and in the
centre where the accommodation block is located.
The bridge and command spaces slightly overhang
the forward end of the lower deck, with a glazed
downward-looking section to allow the cargo chief to
direct loading operations by direct observation.

As standard, the _Argacan_ is armed for strong
self-defence. Two turrets are carried atop the
upper deck, with one more at each corner of the
lower deck, all remotely controlled from a gunnery

chamber just aft of the bridge. As standard, the
dorsal turrets mount an all-laser armament, with a
sandcaster/beam laser armament aft and a missile/
laser mix forward. Beam lasers are considered to
be defensive weapons, allowing these turrets to
switch from sand or missile operations to close-in
defence against missiles and small craft.

Crew complement can vary and some operators
prefer to take delivery without armament. As
standard, the vessel operates with a commanding
officer who also serves as either the astrogator
or chief engineer, plus a mix of specialist
and multiskilled crewmembers. A total of four
engineering crew are required, including three
qualified as engineers and one to perform ‘light’
technical or maintenance tasks. This requirement
can be fulfilled by multiskilled personnel with other
duties so long as there are enough people to
get the job done and a total of three levels of the
Engineer skill are present aboard.

A typical crew includes a pilot and two other
bridge-qualified personnel, which may include
the commanding officer, a chief engineer and
sufficient other personnel to perform necessary
duties, with some multiskilled crew who have
Gunner skill if weapons are carried. Standard
complement is six to eight without weapons and
eight to ten if weapons are carried.

Performance is above the level of the typical trader,
which comes at the price of increased cost and
reduced cargo capacity. Some users will never
need the light hull armour or the weaponry but
these allow the Argacan to appeal to a wider target
audience. The cargo bay can be configured into a
small barracks or vehicle transport garage, making
this a useful ship for a world government wanting
to project power or a mercenary unit needing
low-cost transport. Starmerc units specialising
in raiding might also favour this vessel. As yet, it
is in service with only a few clients but General
Products is convinced it has a winner in the
Argacan and is offering vessels on a generous
mortgage scheme to help popularise it.

The original Kinunir vanguard cruiser was a
major disappointment both for its designers and
its operators. Only 20 were ever buil and about a
quarter of those are already out of service. General
Products, in particular, staked a lot on the class and
lost heavily both in financial terms and in prestige.
The Improved Kinunir is an attempt to salvage
something from the debacle by reworking the design
and making use of the streamlined plan originally
set up to mass-produce the class.

General hull form is near-identical to the original
design, using a flattened cone shape. Layout is
generally conventional, with drives aft and control
spaces forward. A pinnace is carried for liaison
work and personnel transfers. However, there are
some major differences between the Improved
Kinunir and its predecessor; the requirement
to carry a platoon of marines, imposed late in
development upon the original and the cause of
many troubles, has been deleted and the space
repurposed. The Improved Kinunir is intended to
carry a squad of marines for shipboard security
and boarding parties but is no longer billed as
capable of putting down insurrections. Instead, the
Improved Kinunir is what the design was originally
intended to be; a patrol and escort vessel.

The Improved Kinunir is slightly larger than
the Chrysanthemum escort destroyer and has
the same level of strategic mobility – jump-4.
However, it cannot keep pace in normal space
with fleet elements and is not intended to, as 4G
acceleration is entirely enough for security work,
saving greatly on costs and fuel requirements. The
Improved Kinunir is not intended to operate with
the sector fleet; instead it is aimed at the subsector
fleet and individual world governments that wish to
contribute to local security.

Primary armament consists of two particle
accelerator barbettes located to fire in a forward
arc. These are more than sufficient to outgun a

###### IMPROVED KINUNIR PATROL DESTROYER TYPE:—

typical pirate or small raider, and are backed up by
two missile turrets. A battery of eight laser turrets
is mounted along the sides of the central fin and
primarily intended for defensive fire. In the escort
role an Improved Kinunir can engage missiles or
small craft heading for its charges; the pattern of
four turrets each side of the fin ensures that only
half the complement can engage a given target at
once but provides good all-round protection against
the sort of relatively minor threats this vessel is
intended to deal with.

One of the more controversial alterations from
the original design is the addition of a thin layer of
bonded superdense armour. Critics of the design
have suggested that more armour or none at
all would be better options. However, the level
of protection fitted was the most that could be
added without a redesign and provides sufficient
protection to defeat or at least mitigate hits from
light weapons. The Improved Kinunir is not
intended to fight cruisers or fleet destroyers; it is a
long-range patrol asset whose likely opponents are
pirate vessels.

The Improved Kinunir nominally requires a crew
of 50, plus a marine contingent. Usually a squad
of eight is carried, led by either a senior sergeant
or a second lieutenant. The marines are usually
cross-trained to be able to take over some
shipboard tasks including maintenance, damage
control and gunnery, which allows ships to run
with a slightly lower crew complement.

Other interstellar states might term this vessel a
frigate but the Imperial Navy does not currently use
that designation. Although unlikely to be adopted
for use by a sector fleet, the Improved Kinunir is
intended to be attractive to the navy as a security
platform and thus complies with Imperial Navy
designation practice. At the present time this vessel
is offered to a variety of clients and has gone into
low-volume production but the Imperial Navy has
not made a decision about adoption.

The following information is readily available at most
data terminals, although the exact wording may vary
if there are local considerations such as bias against
certain nobles, governments or business groups. Library
data represents what is commonly known, not the whole
truth. Some entries are entirely false, although this is
rare. Such data tends to get weeded out by routine fact-checking, although there are some persistent myths and
falsehoods that just will not go away.

###### ABYSS RIFT

The so-called Abyss Rift lies within the Lanth
subsector, although some claim it extends into
neighbouring Vilis. It is a small region of extremely
low stellar density with a reputation for starship
disappearances and misjumps. There have been
reports of radio signals received whilst in jump – which
is thought to be impossible – and even of ‘someone
or something on the hull, trying to get in’. Some of
these reports have come from reliable witnesses but
most seem to be variants on old spacers’ tales whose
origins probably lie in the bottom of a bottle.

There are seven worlds within the Abyss Rift, of which
three are Red Zoned. Reasons for interdiction are
rarely given, so there is nothing out of the ordinary
in the lack of available information. Despite this, the
usual conspiracy theorists make much of the fact that
there are multiple Red and Amber Zones in the rift.
The fact that the centre of the rift seems to lie in Lanth
1917, between the interdicted worlds of Ylaven and
Victoria, suggests to many that there is something
very unusual in the area.

###### ARGACAN MULTIPURPOSE VESSEL

Manufactured by General Products, the Argacan is a
new market entry. It is a multipurpose transport vessel
capable of acting as a naval auxiliary, carrying out light
patrol work or even acting as an escort for civilian traffic.
It is obviously aimed at governmental clients and as with
all such ships, the Imperial Navy or perhaps the Imperial
Marines is the ideal target. Thus far sales have been low
but it is believed that large numbers have already been
put into production in anticipation of orders.

# L IBRARY DATA

###### DENISOV BATTLECRUISER

The Denisov-class is the pride of the Sword Worlds
fleets, and the most prestigious command available. It is
not the largest or most heavily armed vessel available,
nor is it a dedicated command cruiser even although it
has command facilities. However, its dashing reputation
and the possibility of being turned loose to conduct a
spectacular raiding cruise makes the Denisov the most
desirable posting an officer could wish for.

The Denisovs were designed as highly mobile super-cruisers rather than true capital ships, capable of
undertaking devastating raiding cruises into enemy
territory. Layout is conventional for Sword Worlds
ships, with a central hull in the shape of a blocky
cylinder and two cylindrical outriggers containing
additional systems. The class uses a dispersed power
generation system to increase survivability and has
sufficient fuel to jump a total of four parsecs, although
its drives can only manage jump-3. This is in keeping
with the intended role as a raider.

###### FEDERATION OF ARDEN

The ‘Federation of Arden’ may or may not be a
political entity, depending on who is consulted on the
subject. Its basis is in a complex history beginning
with colonisation of Arden and nearby worlds during
the Long Night. There are records of what might be
termed a pocket empire centred on Arden but these
are questionable as they exist only on Arden itself.
It is probable that the colonised worlds remained
in contact using their colony ships but entered a
technological decline resulting in the loss of starflight
capability later in the Long Night.

The population of these worlds lost touch with their
Vilani heritage over the centuries and are recorded as
being ‘neo-barbarians’ by the first explorers from the
Third Imperium to discover them. That term can have
many meanings and does not necessarily indicate
low technology or a lack of civilised values. Settlers
from the expanding Imperium are known to have
reached Arden around 290, although details on how
well they were integrated are sketchy. Arden joined
the Imperium after the First Frontier War but became
independent after the Third.



Ever since independence, in 986, Arden has been
reinventing itself in two ways. It promotes its port as
a neutral location for contact between the Imperium
and the Zhodani Consulate. Some of this is official
but more commonly Arden acts as a back-channels
conduit for diplomacy and a host for contact at a lower
level. This typically means cross-border trade, not all
of it of a legal nature.

The other reinvention is as the head of the ‘Federation
of Arden’ whose existence is debatable. It is not
officially recognised by the Imperium, the Consulate,
nor most of the governments Arden claims are
members and indeed the nature of the Federation
seems to change depending on the current agenda.
At present the Federation is presented as a framework
of trade agreements and assistance treaties with no
political requirements, although Arden likes to present
the Federation as a political bloc when it thinks it can
get away with the statement.

It may be that the Federation of Arden remains a
political fiction but it is unofficially recognised by
some business groups and shipping lines. Arden has
manoeuvred itself into a position where it can negotiate
on behalf of ‘Federation members’ who are given

incentives not to dispute the arrangement. This is
costing Arden a great deal of money but seems to be
working. Each new client that recognises Arden as the
first among equals in its little corner of space is a step
towards the creation of a formal polity.

One policy currently being pursued is the acquisition of
starships. These include low-cost patrol ships to increase
security and create the impression of a political union
that can defend itself. Most, however, are trade vessels
which are mostly assigned to regular runs among
‘Federation member’ worlds or to special projects. There
is big money on offer by the standards of independent
shipbuilders. The Imperial megacorporations have not
been so keen – Arden is small fry by their standards and
does not appear to favour suppliers with close ties to any
of the major powers.

###### FORTRESS RHYLANOR

Fortress Rhylanor is one of several ‘Fortress’
projects proudly declared by the Imperial Navy since
the end of the Fourth Frontier War. Others include
Fortress Efate, Fortress Lanth and Fortress Regina.
As part of a move towards an ‘elastic defence’
doctrine, the navy designated certain worlds as

##### Library Data

forward bases or fortresses. These would serve as
a breakwater even if the Imperial Navy was driven
back from the systems around them.

The Fortress project includes navy subsidies to expand
system defences with orbital forts, ground-based
defensive systems and additional non-jump-capable
craft. These are to be backed up by a deployment of
battle riders from the sector fleet’s reserves to create a
defence force capable of withstanding a major attack
until relieved. Variously portrayed as a set of secure
forward bases from which to punish the Zhodani for
invading and a group of fortified islands amid a sea
of invaders, with naval forces lunging out to clear one
system then another, the Fortress worlds are portrayed
as the keystones of the defence plan.

Critics of the project claim that it is a return to the ‘thin
hard crust’ strategy, which proved unsatisfactory in the
past, and that the defences are either too weak or too
strong. Those who think they are too weak suggest
that the navy is setting itself up to be defeated in detail
trying to rescue the Fortress worlds, which will be
necessary for strategic and political reasons. The navy
may find itself driven to make advances simply to avoid
losing face when its much-vaunted Fortress project
turns out to be a paper armadillo.

Others say that far too much budget money is being
spent on fortifying worlds that will never be attacked.
Meanwhile, they say, the interior of the sector is
vulnerable to raids and rebellions. The fleet should be
protecting everyone, not a handful of worlds on what
is now a peaceful frontier. The Zhodani Consulate can
be kept friendly by trade and diplomacy but the same
cannot be said for internal threats such as the rabid Ine
Givar movement. Instead of endlessly training to support
the Fortress worlds the navy should be reminding
dissenters that it stands ready to put down any revolt.

###### GENERAL PROCUREMENT LIC

Despite similarities in name, General Procurement LIC
is not part of the megacorporation General Products.
It is a privately owned procurement and disposal
company specialising in obtaining starship components
or whole ships for a range of clients and of disposing of
surplus ships and equipment. Disposal in this context
can mean destruction or scrapping but more commonly
General Procurement acts as a conduit to sell off
surplus equipment and vessels. The firm has a contract
with the Spinward Marches fleet to dispose of surplus
items at the best price it can get, recovering a little of

the fleet’s budget at the end of a vessel’s service life.
There are strict rules about what such a private concern
can handle; warships are stripped of sensitive systems
before being handed over.

###### GENERAL PRODUCTS

General Products is an Imperial megacorporation
specialising in starship construction and heavy industry.
It is known for low-cost bulk production rather than
the quality of its systems but overall has a good
reputation in the marketplace. This has been dented
in the starship sector by a number of underperforming
designs. Most notorious of those was the Kinunir-class
vanguard cruiser whose production run was curtailed
after only 20 were built. Serious flaws in the design
emerged during operational use, although the class did
still manage to provide good service.

At present, General Products is pushing heavily in
the Spinward Marches in the hope of reclaiming lost
market share. In addition to new and upgraded starship
construction yards, notably at Jae Tellona, the firm
has taken on contracts to provide heavy industrial
machinery on several worlds. The terms of such
agreements are kept confidential but there are claims
that General Products are loss-leading in order to
achieve a better position in the local market. This is not
uncommon, although the scale is noteworthy.

###### INE GIVAR

The Ine Givar is often described as a terrorist
organisation, though it was not always such. There
is a tendency to apply the ‘terrorist’ label rather
loosely in the hope of discrediting a target. In the
case of the Ine Givar, its original intentions appear to
have been relatively ‘clean’ and some segments of
the organisation are opposed to the use of terrorist
methods either on moral grounds or because they are
deemed counterproductive in the long run.

Like many such groups, the Ine Givar was formed
from various like-minded movements, all of which
were opposed to the Imperial system. Concentration
of wealth and power in a small class of nobles
and megacorporations – the two are intertwined in
Imperial society – is seen as a major injustice by most
members. Some are associated with the Ine Givar for
other reasons, such as revenge for some past action,
and it may be that these were the driving force in
escalating the organisation’s level of violence.

##### Library Data



Officially, the Ine Givar is a peaceful organisation
promoting a move towards greater democracy and
social equality but most of the members who are true
to this ideal have dissociated themselves. What is left
is a rather nasty insurgency movement dedicated to
bringing about the collapse of the Third Imperium by
any means necessary. The Ine Givar quietly sponsors
and feeds weaponry to groups that would not choose
to be associated if they knew where the support was
coming from – anyone with a grievance against the
Imperium will be supported whether openly or covertly.

Most Ine Givar chapters believe that the ends justify
the means and are willing to engage in terrorism
but some seem to relish it more than others. The
majority of actions are still ‘clean’, taking the form
of insurgency against military targets rather than
terrorist attacks on civilians. Other means are also
routinely used; industrial disruption from strikes or
slowdowns, bribery, coercion and extortion. This is a
factor that makes the Ine Givar more dangerous than
most insurgent organisations as it is adept at many
forms of attack against the fabric of the Imperium. It
has been suggested that the Ine Givar is a front for
Zhodani activities, but it is more likely that it is an
entirely separate organisation but willing to accept
help from anywhere.

###### KINUNIR VANGUARD CRUISER

The Kinunir was the subject of major controversy
from the start. Allegations of favouritism and outright
corruption were never proven, but the procurement
process that led to orders being placed was certainly
controversial. Large orders were placed with several
shipyards, though the bulk of construction was to be
carried out by General Products, which was heavily
involved in the design of the vessel.

The basic concept of the Kinunir was sound, although
compromises and design changes along the way
weakened it in some areas whilst giving it capabilities
it did not need in its primary role. Although rather
vaingloriously dubbed a vanguard cruiser or even a
battle cruiser, the Kinunir was an escort or perhaps
a light destroyer. With a primary armament of two
particle accelerators backed up by lasers and a small
missile capability, the class is capable of dealing with
the average pirate vessel with ease, and could in all
probability defeat a group of corvettes whilst retaining
combat effectiveness.

During the development process new requirements
emerged. The small marine contingent originally
intended for boarding parties grew to a whole platoon
with meteoric assault capability. This was advertised
as enabling a Kinunir to act as a ‘fire brigade’ dealing
with unrest or insurgency, although the small numbers
of troops aboard would be of limited use in a major
incident. A Kinunir would be able to bring rapid
assistance to bear on a threatened noble’s estate or
embassy, or to deploy troops to cover an evacuation
of such a facility. The marines had their uses but the
capability offered did not live up to the hype.

Other changes were more significant. According to
rumour, the Kinunir was used as a testbed for several
experimental systems. A new missile autoloader
was among them, although most vessels received a
standard system instead. Unconfirmed reports claim
some vessels had an advanced artificial intelligence
system aboard or some kind of experimental shield
generator. The Imperial Navy will neither confirm nor
deny such rumours.

The name-ship of the class was laid down by General
Products after two other vessels – Shulgi and Zaggisi

- were put into production by competitors. General

Products was able to record flight three days ahead
of these ships by rushing Kinunir to completion. The
loss of the vessel under mysterious circumstances in
1088 resulted in accusations of cutting corners, to the
severe detriment of General Products’ reputation in the
starship construction sector.

In addition to Kinunir , four other members of the class
are no longer in service. Allamu and Ninkur Sagga
were both lost in the Battle of Two Suns, a major
action of the Fourth Frontier War. Gaesh proved
unsatisfactory during trials and was paid off to become
a prison hulk and Shuruppak was transferred to the
Vegan Autonomous District. It is not clear if this vessel
was satisfactory or not. In addition, Adda Dubsar never
entered service. The half-built hulk was scrapped on
the ways after production was curtailed. Fifteen vessels
of the class remain in service with the Imperial Navy.

###### MAGNETODYNAMICS

MagnetoDynamics is a mining and mineral extraction
corporation. It was established in 1040 with the
goal of implementing newly patented techniques
for the extraction of resources from atmospheric
and oceanic suspension. The world of Fulacin was

deemed ideal for this kind of exploitation and was
leased to MagnetoDynamics in return for expansion
of the starport.

The project has overall been a success, although not
without some difficulties. Extraction proved viable
but the cost of expanding the port absorbed much of
the company’s profits until the outbreak of the Fourth
Frontier War in 1082. Economic conditions after the
war were difficult, causing a suspension of operations
until new investors came forward in 1089. Since this
time MagnetoDynamics has profited both from mineral
extraction and commerce at the starport, opening up
additional facilities on the planetary surface. The firm
has expressed an interest in moving into asteroid
mining using an unspecified new technique.

###### STARSHIP CORPORATION

RVSC is a business group with its headquarters at
Deneb, in the sector of that name. Incorporated in
861, it claims descent from several older starship
manufacturing yards which operated independently
in niche markets during the previous centuries.
RVSC today specialises in repurposed and modified
vessels, although much of its revenue comes from
refurbishing and refitting standard designs. The
company does not custom-build vessels, however it
will outfit a standard ship to the user’s specifications.
The usual practice in this case is to buy in the
vessel at the ‘ready for fitting-out’ stage, have them
delivered to an RVSC yard for completion.

###### RHYLANOR FREIGHT SERVICES LIC

Rhylanor Freight Services is a Limited Imperial
Company operating a mix of jump-1 and jump-2
vessels out of Jae Tellona. Jump-1 ships maintain a

regular service to Rhylanor, where the company was
incorporated, by way of Porozlo. Most of these ships
are Type R subsidised merchants. Jump-2 services
are operated to Belizo, Celepina and Fulacin using
mostly far trader-type vessels. This operation is what
would usually be termed a ‘feeder service’ and is
reliant on high volumes of traffic at the interface points
on the Spinward Main.

###### SILENT OBSERVER

Silent Observer is a privately owned infobrokerage,
whose publicity materials claim it has access to
information sources nobody else can get close to.
Whether or not this is true, Silent Observer does a
brisk business in data from shipping records to ancient
history. Everything offered in its constantly-updated
catalogue is entirely legal but often hard to find or
helpfully collated. A small membership fee gives access
to ‘top layer’ data in the manner of an encyclopaedia,
with in-depth information on any subject available for
a fee. It is rumoured that there are additional layers of
membership and that there are state secrets or pieces
of scandalous information on public figures available to
those who have worked their way up the membership
hierarchy. This may simply be a clever marketing
gambit to keep customers paying.

###### SHORTHOP SHIPPING LIC

ShortHop Shipping has its head office at Mora. It
operates a fleet of small jump-2 vessels, many of
them converted scout/couriers. ShortHop has a few
dedicated routes, some of them on contract to the
Imperial authorities to maintain communications to
otherwise isolated systems. However, most of its
vessels operate on an ad-hoc basis from Rhylanor,
Mora and Lunion. Contracts are typically one-off courier
or personnel transport missions for a variety of clients.

##### Library Data

Whispers on the Abyss is a standalone mini-campaign
but it is far more than that. The Abyss referenced in
the title could be assumed to be the Abyss Rift which
spans the Lanth and Vilis subsectors, but there is
another possible meaning.

That abyss is the spectre of all-out war between the
Zhodani Consulate and the Third Imperium. That war
has begun.

The great fleets are in motion and the Consulate
has the initiative. Its forces can strike wherever they
wish and the Imperial Navy can only react. It is likely
the Zhodani will be able to run wild for at least a few
weeks or months before a coherent response can be
mounted. At that time the situation may stabilise and
the character of the conflict will change.

If the Imperium can avoid being forced to the
negotiating table in the first months of the war, the
outcome is in doubt. It is impossible to say which side
will have the advantage once Imperial reinforcements
arrive. It may be that the outcome of the war depends
upon many small factors – a band of Travellers here,
a warship crew there. What is certain is that the
Travellers stand atop one of the fulcrums of history. Will
they rise to the challenge? Will they flee the war zone?
Will they pursue their own goals against the backdrop
of the Fifth Frontier War? Only they can decide.

Long-time Traveller players may think they know the
outcome of this conflict but everything can change.
It may be useful to think of previous publications
covering the Fifth Frontier War as being simulations or
expectations of how it will play out. The Fifth Frontier
War series from Mongoose Publishing may take a
different course, and will definitely allow Travellers to
have a hand in deciding the outcome.
