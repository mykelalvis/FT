### Prisons

Prisons tend not to be large. Worlds handle their own law enforcement and punishment of offenders, and the [[Imperium]] only deals with Imperial felons. Most of the latter are guilty of extremely serious crimes, which may carry the death penalty. These hardcore prisoners are detained in extremely high-security installations on asteroids, in remote areas or aboard prison hulks created by gutting a surplus starship of its drives and weapons. Less dangerous perpetrators of significant crimes, such as large-scale embezzlement, are also detained in these installations.

#### Incarcerated in the Spinward Marches
Despite a number of accusations and entertainment shows on the subject, the [[Imperium]] does not have hundreds of prison hulks filled with political prisoners scattered throughout [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]]. There are relatively few Imperial felonies meriting incarceration in an installation of this kind. The sort of people sent to them are those considered far too dangerous to be dealt with in any other way, or else those with a penchant for escaping custody or evading punishment and who therefore require special treatment. The cost of supporting these installations is considerable, so they are only used when necessary.
