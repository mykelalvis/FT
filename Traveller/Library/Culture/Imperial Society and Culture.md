# IMPERIAL SOCIETY AND CULTURE

The Third Imperium covers a broad expanse of space that includes distinct regions, peoples and cultures. However, there are certain norms and standards consistent across Imperial space. The first of these is language. While many human and alien races speak their own native languages, Galanglic is the official language of the Imperium. Galanglic is descended from Terran English but has changed significantly in the millennia since Terrans first took to the stars.

The governments of Imperial worlds are independent. There is no uniform Imperial style of government or guidelines for how to govern a world. However, the Imperial bureaucracy is present on most of its worlds, run by the nobility. Nobles serve as Imperial administrators, collecting taxes, interfacing with other Imperial agencies such as the navy and scouts, and making sure that the worlds of the Imperium abide by its laws. Each world also has its own legal system; the laws of each world can be very different. Some worlds have highly codified, stringent legal systems on which it is quite easy for Travellers to run afoul of the law. Others have few or no laws at all. The Imperium does not impede upon the laws of its worlds unless they conflict with Imperial law. Imperial law is mostly vague, allowing the Emperor to alter it depending on circumstances but some Imperial laws are immutable.

The Imperial Credit, or simply the Credit, is the currency of the Imperium. There may be some instances in which barter or local currencies exist on various worlds but the currency of interstellar trade and commerce is the Credit.

The Imperium is a diverse and cosmopolitan place. It is home to two Major Races, dozens of Minor Races and to many individuals from among the other Major Races who have immigrated to the Imperium from their own polities. Generally speaking, the Imperium is a welcoming and accepting place for all of them. There are xenophobic cultures that might take issue with foreign humans or aliens on their worlds, usually backwaters and low-population worlds that see little interstellar traffic that are less accustomed to the diverse nature of the Imperium surrounding them. Even in the heart of the Imperium, pockets of such worlds exist. Likewise, Travellers might witness isolated acts of racism and intolerance here and there but overall the varied array of human and alien races are accepted as part of life in the Imperium. There is mutual respect and tolerance between most sophonts who see little difference between each other regardless of the fact that many Minor Races look and behave quite differently from the human majority.

Imperial culture is varied and its worlds can be quite different from one another, even those only a few parsecs apart. Religion, fashion, sport, entertainment and other aspects of culture differ from world-to-world. Imperial worlds do have some things in common: trade and the presence of the Imperial military and nobility. Each of these institutions imports ideas, styles of dress and cultural norms that are often mimicked by the societies of Imperial worlds, especially those more open to interstellar culture. Imperial culture is also defined by its contrasts with neighboring human and alien polities. For example, the Zhodani embrace the use of psionics but they are anathema in the Imperium. Likewise, the stark differences seen in Aslan, Vargr and other alien cultures contrast with Imperial culture, more sharply defining it.

## Trade

Trade is the lifeblood of the Imperium. At its heart, the Third Imperium is a federation of worlds unified by free trade and open communication. The first Emperor established the empire based on the notion that free trade would enrich its citizens and bring civilization to its worlds. The history of the Imperium has proved him right.

The majority of trade revenue is earned by megacorporate and sector-wide merchant lines that run freight operations along the major trade routes. These routes primarily serve worlds with high populations and other factors that give them importance. Trade goods are transported aboard megafreighters in the multi-10,000-ton range. However, the trade routes only serve 10 percent of Imperial worlds. The remaining 90 percent get their goods from subsector merchant lines, interface lines and tramp traders.

The tramp trader is the bottom rung of the food chain but operating such a ship is a romanticised enterprise. The captains of tramp traders are their own bosses, plying interstellar space in Type-A free traders or Type-A2 far traders, picking up small freight and mail lots when possible, carrying and serving passengers, and speculating on cargoes that may or may not be in demand at the next port. It is a difficult life, made more so by the constant need for an influx of Credits to pay the starship mortgage. Most of them would not have it any other way. Tramp traders do not have to leave the trade routes to do well. In spite of the fact that the big merchant lines gobble up most of the business, there is work to be had by small traders. There are many niche and underserved markets hidden away on the worlds of the trade routes. Most tramp traders spend time on the main routes and veer off them when profits beckon elsewhere.

Secondary routes and stellar clusters are also served by the tramp trader community but many of these attract mid-sized lines, which appoint subsidised merchant starships to serve them on an experimental basis. The most popular spacecraft for such trade missions is the 400-ton Type-R subsidised merchant, affectionately called the ‘fat trader’ or ‘subby’ by people in the business. If running a subsidised merchant reveals that profits are there to be had, an interface or subsector line will eventually invest in a secondary or cluster route, turning its worlds into regular stops.

Trade is not always solely motivated by immediate profits. In the early days of the Imperium, even when the distance travelled between worlds was too great for trade to be immediately profitable, technological exchange proved to be beneficial for both parties. Many of the early Imperial trade missions were run at a loss, with the intention of seeding the routes to distant worlds with outposts and colonies. By exporting technology to distant worlds, early traders gave them the means to start producing high-tech goods of their own. Eventually, such societies made technological advancements and learned to produce things that the worlds at the heart of the Imperium could use. As the populations and economies of the worlds in between began to rise and Imperial borders expanded, the distant worlds that the Imperium had invested in became valued trading partners.

An ancillary benefit of trade missions was cultural exchange. Visiting distant worlds enabled Imperial traders to establish common ground with peoples and cultures that had not been a part of interstellar society for centuries. The day would come when they would be asked to join the empire. The less foreign and alien the Imperium seemed, the more likely these worlds would be willing to become full-fledged members. Such missions are still undertaken along the frontiers of the Imperium, although there are far fewer unincorporated worlds in Charted Space in modern times.

The spirit of free trade on the frontiers lives on with the exploratory trade companies. Spinward Marches-based corporations like Barracai Technum and McClellan Factors operate armed Leviathan -class merchant cruisers in the backwaters and beyond their borders. These spacecraft are over 1,000 tons in size and designed to travel into potentially hazardous regions in order to establish contacts with new trading partners. Merchant cruisers have relatively small cargo holds, in which they carry wares from civilised space meant to serve as enticements to join the trade community. Frontier trade also attracts interest from the intelligence community. Merchants operating on the fringe garner the attention of various agencies that want information about what is happening beyond Imperial borders.

Developmental trade missions and burgeoning new routes are not limited to the frontiers. Old routes closer to the heart of the Imperium frequently die out and new ones take their place. It often depends on which of the big industrial worlds are producing the top products at a given time. When a middling or struggling industrial world suddenly makes a breakthrough, or just lucks into a market that becomes hot, traffic shifts to accommodate the trend. There are big profits to be made for merchants who read the tea leaves correctly and beat everyone else to new markets. The trends are always shifting and the most successful traders are those who catch the wave before their competitors see it coming.

## Technology

The Imperium benefits from the highest technology in Charted Space. They are in rare company, having achieved TL15. Only the K’kree of the Two Thousand Worlds, Hive Federation and some polities of the Vargr Extents have matched this level of achievement. The Aslan Hierate, Zhodani Consulate and Solomani Confederation are standardised on a slightly lower Tech Level of 14. The single level of advantage is significant, with TL15 granting the ability to manufacture jump- drives, significantly more output from fusion power plants and many other innovations.

Imperial scientific agencies, the military and corporations are pushing the envelope to the next Tech Level. A few worlds have already achieved the next technological milestone. The industrial world of Vincennes in Deneb, the research station at Pashus also in Deneb and the tech-focused colony at Gannvair in Fornast have each risen to TL16. At this level, independent artificial intelligence, antimatter energy production, brain transplants, miniaturization of previous technologies and resultant improvements in communications and weapons technologies become available.

Imperial culture embraces the judicious use of artificial intelligence to produce wondrous technologies and manage massive populations in the tens of billions. There are numerous safeguards in place to ensure the safety of this technology but innovation is always being pushed to the limit. At the Imperial Naval Base on Celetron, there are experiments under way to create the first fully autonomous starships. The Ye- lu system has taken it a step further by automating an entire world. The Saregon system has foregone traditional government and allowed an AI computer to govern billions of sophonts. The fear of unbridled technology persists but the pressure to remove constraints is strong.

While there is always a race to reach new heights of technology, the Imperium is a diverse society whose primary cultural influences come from the Vilani and Solomani. Dating back to the age of the Ziru Sirka, the Vilani have preached caution in the development and use of technology; meanwhile the Solomani have always emphasised continuous innovation and advancement. The two are at cross purposes but their divergent philosophies have found ways to coexist. Both Vland and Terra are at the Imperium’s maximum Tech Level of 15. Despite the constant drumbeat of progress, the Imperium does exercise caution in key fields of research and development in an effort to keep technological development under control and prevent potentially dangerous technologies from proliferating across Imperial borders.

## Law

There are three types of law in Imperial space:

- Planetary law – Each world is empowered to author its own laws that establish everything from the enforcement of petty infractions to high crimes like murder, kidnapping, extortion and theft.
- Subsector law – The primary purpose of subsector law is to ensure that star systems do not exert undue oppression or cruelty upon one another. To an extensive degree, star systems are allowed to influence and control each other but when it impedes economic growth, threatens trade or opposes the interests of the Imperium, subsector-level authorities may intervene. - Imperial law – Crimes such as treason, revolt, tax evasion and undue violence between worlds using weapons of mass destruction invokes Imperial law, enforced by Imperial military forces.

Few Imperial laws are codified, with most left deliberately vague. The Imperium is an immense polity with widespread and diverse populations. What works in the spinward region of the empire might not apply to trailing or for that matter between two worlds that are a few parsecs apart.

There is a significant grey area in Imperial law when it comes to the rules of war. Simply put, the Imperium allows belligerent forces to engage in war with one another provided they do not break the immutable Imperial laws, free trade is not impeded, and undue cruelty or oppression is not inflicted on one side or the other. Imperial law may also be invoked if a war between nations or worlds escalates and threatens to spread to a larger cluster of systems or an entire subsector. Other than that, war is considered to be a necessary outlet for aggression that should not be suppressed. Doing so can create an even worse situation in which a drawn-out cycle of terrorism, sabotage, assassination, insurrection and subterfuge create a long-term problem. While wars inevitably result in an unfortunate loss of life and a great deal of property damage, they can sometimes produce solutions in far less time with fewer casualties and a reduced negative effect on the local economy. The Imperium is quick to point out that this allowance is not an endorsement of war. Quite the opposite. The
nobility does what it can to create diplomatic channels and mediation between opposed sides. Should a conflict escalate to war, it is not above the Imperium to pick sides. Assistance to one side or the other may sometimes be granted when it is deemed in the empire’s best interests.

## Solomani and Vilani

The majority of Imperial citizens are human and come from a variety of subspecies but the most prevalent are the Vilani and Solomani. The Vilani, who came from Vland, discovered jump drive technology thousands of years before Terra and built the largest interstellar empire in the history of Charted Space. Just as that empire began to falter, the Terrans aggressively came onto the scene and swept the Ziru Sirka away during the Interstellar Wars. Having become an interstellar people themselves, the descendants of the Terrans became known as the Solomani, meaning ‘men of Sol’.

The Vilani and Solomani have slight physical differences despite having evolved on different worlds for hundreds of thousands of years but culturally they are quite different. Because of the challenges posed by living on a world that was not their own, the Vilani became a conservative people who favoured cautious resource management and tradition over unbridled innovation. Conversely, the Solomani were more aggressive, uninhibited in their advancement of science and technology. After the Solomani conquered the Ziru Sirka and declared the Rule of Man, the two human subspecies and their cultures became irrevocably intertwined.

After thousands of years of coexistence, Vilani and Solomani have found common ground. Social and physical intermixing has created a hybrid in which tenets of both cultures are present. The divisions between them are as evident as they have always been but they have learned to cooperate, leveraging advantages of both cultures to make a better Imperium. This is not to say that conflicts do not arise. Situations inevitably come up in which Vilani and Solomani values directly clash with one another. However, such occurrences are increasingly rare.

It is difficult to say which culture holds greater sway in modern times. The Vilani had thousands of years to perfect the art of building and maintaining an empire, while the Solomani had only a few brief centuries of experience before they inherited all of Vilani space. The Solomani had little inkling of what to do next after they won the Interstellar Wars. Solomani culture was thin gruel compared with the ancient and highly structured Vilani civilization. The Rule of Man raped and looted the First Imperium but were ultimately made students of its conservative, empire-building ways. To paraphrase the ancient Terran poet, Horace, ‘Captive Vland captured her rude conqueror’.

While the Vilani certainly knew a lot about empire building, the Solomani knew how to give an empire some teeth. Their embrace of technology and innovation enabled Humaniti to reach heretofore unseen levels of technological advancement and the security that it provides. As Humaniti began to encounter and conflict with the other Major Races, it is doubtful it could have survived with the arbitrary constraints placed upon technological development by the Vilani.

Despite all of this, there remain several forbidden realms of technology where the old Vilani caution creeps in. Foremost among these is uncontrolled artificial intelligence. The war machines that were left on Vland by the Ancients, destructive automatons that posed an existential threat to humans, left their indelible mark on the culture. The Vilani were driven to reach beyond their world but also chastened by a history in which technology was a thing to be feared.

## Psionics

The first widespread use of psionics was recorded during the Long Night, when isolated worlds and pocket empires validated the practice. Some worlds were even led by psions or governments that employed them in advisory roles.

The practice of psionics was mostly viewed as an oddity in the Third Imperium, despite their growing usage and acceptance during the first centuries of Imperial history. Psionic institutes and programmes at universities taught psionically talented individuals how to use their abilities to read minds, move matter and instantly teleport from place-to-place. These programmes reached a peak in popularity from about 650 to the mid-700s. However, a series of psionic scandals rocked the Imperium in the late 700s, resulting in the public turning upon psionics and those who used them. The Psionics Suppressions of the early 800s repressed the use of psionics and revoked the charters of nearly all psionic institutes. Psionics became illegal in Imperial space and practitioners were forced underground.

In the modern era, psionics are still illegal but two institutes remain in service, one on Wypoc in the Spinward Marches and the other on Terra. These institutes purportedly focus on the study of psionic phenomena to ensure the safety of Imperial citizens from external forces and foreign states that use them.

## Cultural Zones

The Warrant for the Restoration of the Imperium was published in Imperial year 0, claiming that all of the territory held by the Ziru Sirka and Rule of Man combined was the rightful domain of the Third Imperium. Using the Warrant for Restoration as its justification, the Imperium expanded its borders and consolidated its interior during the Pacification Campaigns.

The Third Imperium managed to integrate most of the worlds previously held by its predecessors. This was not accomplished without making sacrifices; inevitably, the Imperium encountered peoples and cultures reluctant to join. Circumstances dictated the methods by which they were coerced.

The Domain of Antares proved to be difficult to conquer during the Pacification Campaigns and the subsequent Julian War gained the Imperium no additional ground. Concessions had to be made to bring the region on board. A collection of worlds known as the League of Antares was established as a cultural region in order to placate the most resistant forces in the domain.

Likewise, in the far-flung Corridor, Gushemege and Dagudashaag sectors, the Lancian and Amec Protectorate cultural regions were granted to preserve distinct cultures that had developed during the nearly two millennia of the Long Night. The Luriani Cultural Association was similar. Of all the human Minor Races, the amphibious Luriani proved to be the most difficult to assimilate. The Imperium managed to bring them into the fold over time and granting them their own cultural region was a necessity.

Not all of the cultural regions were granted as concessions. Some were established to reward loyal service to the Imperium. The Vegan Autonomous District was given as a boon to the alien Vegans, whose aid to the Imperium was instrumental in its victory during the Solomani Rim War. The Sylean Worlds were established to honor the contributions of the Syleans, whose cultural principles and personal sacrifices were a crucial part of the foundation upon which the Imperium was built and maintained.

Additional cultural regions have been proposed for the Geonee, Suerrat, Darmine and Chanestin. Outliers in the Imperial nobility have even proposed the recruitment of polities such as the Darrian Confederation and Sword Worlds under the auspices of cultural region grants.

The problem with establishing too many cultural regions is that it eventually begs the question of why have an Imperium at all. The entirety of Imperial space could be subdivided into dozens, if not hundreds, of distinct cultural regions, each with their own laws, religions and traditions. In such a scenario, the Imperium would be reduced to a loose confederation of worlds. While some idealists dream of such a thing coming to pass, the astrographic implications are not kind. The Imperium is surrounded by the empires of Major Races and two great human polities: the Zhodani Consulate and Solomani Confederation. Were the Imperium to allow itself to be split into myriad cultural regions, it could become easy prey for its neighbors. The cultural region controversy is one of the defining issues of the modern age, one which Emperor Strephon and Imperial Society and Culture the Moot struggle with on a daily basis.

## Interstellar Relations

The Imperium has a complex array of relationships with the polities on and just beyond its borders. Treaties, armistices and pacts have guaranteed peace with most of its neighbors but there remains some enmity with some of them.

The Zhodani and their Outworld Coalitions have gone to war with the Imperium four times, the first of which began in 589 and the most recent one ending in 1084. In the interim between each war, relations with the Zhodani have been frigid. The Zhodani believe the Imperium is encroaching upon their borders and the Imperium distrusts the Zhodani due to their use of psionics. It is doubtful that the two sides will ever have an amicable relationship.

The Julian Protectorate has gone to war with the Imperium twice, once in the Julian War, which began in 175, and again over three centuries later in the Hidden War. Since its founding, the Imperium has laid claim to the sectors held by the Julian Protectorate based on the principles established in the Warrant for the Restoration of the Imperium. However, the confederated states of the Protectorate have no intention of joining, nor has the Imperium expressed any desire to reignite the flames of the only major war it has ever lost.

Perhaps the greatest threat to peace lies on the border with the Solomani Confederation. The majority of Solomani space was integrated into the Imperium centuries ago but relations declined and Empress Margaret I was forced to give the region its autonomy. The Solomani eventually declared full independence, calling their new state the Solomani Confederation. After a 12-year war, the two sides signed an armistice but not before the Imperium had driven a deep wedge into Solomani space, capturing Terra in the process. Even after over a century of peace, the Solomani are smouldering for a rematch but the powerful Imperium poses a daunting opponent.

The Imperium has a history of conflict with two of the Major Races – the Aslan and Vargr – and no major conflicts with the K’kree, Hivers or Droyne. Of the Major Races, the Imperium shares a border with only the Vargr Extents. There are comfortable buffer zones with the rest, most of which contain collections of independent polities.

The Aslan are an expansionist race united by a philosophy based on honor, which they call _fteir_ in their native language of Trokh. During the Long Night, the Aslan and various human polities fought a series of Border Wars, which ended in the year 380 with the signing of the Peace of Ftahalr. Among its tenets, this treaty provides for a 30-parsec-wide gap between Imperial and Aslan space. While no major war has been fought between the two species since the treaty was signed, the two polities are now in close proximity to one another in the Trojan Reach. The Aslan continue to encroach into neutral territory and Imperial Navy forces in the region are preparing for the worst should a concerted invasion occur but the two remain peaceable with one another... for now.

The Imperium has a much more complicated relationship with the Vargr that dates back to the era before the Long Night. The Vargr were a major impediment to the coreward expansion of the Ziru Sirka; in fact, constant raiding by Vargr corsairs was a contributing factor to the fall of the First Imperium. They continued to be a problem for the Rule of Man. The Third Imperium has gone to war with various Vargr polities during the Pacification Campaigns, Julian War, Vargr Campaigns and all four Frontier Wars. Despite a long history of conflict between the two races, there are more Vargr Imperial citizens than any other alien Major Race.

The Imperium maintains relationships with its neighbors by exchanging embassies with them. The Imperium has no embassies in the Zhodani Consulate, Solomani Confederation nor the Julian Protectorate, but every other interstellar state on the periphery of the Imperium has at least one embassy. Ambassadors are typically selected from the ranks of honor nobles or the diplomatic corps, with a great deal of crossover between the two.

The Vargr and Aslan present unique challenges for the diplomatic corps. It would not be practical to send ambassadors to all of the myriad Vargr states, so only the most important ones are chosen. The Imperium is careful to select ambassadors who are seen as charismatic in the eyes of the Vargr. Ambassadors are often recalled when a state falters or subsides in importance, a common event in Vargr space. Fortunately, the Vargr accept boons and slights much better than most. The Vargr also have a greater innate respect for alien cultures. Plurality and variety in the Vargr Extents lends itself to easier acceptance of foreign societies.

The challenge posed by the easily offended Aslan is quite the opposite. The Imperium sends a separate ambassador to each of the 29 Tlaukhu clans, no matter where they rank in the Hierate. Additional embassies have been established in Aslan space on interface worlds and regions of importance.

While the Imperium has no embassy in Zhodani space, and nor do the Zhodani have one in the Imperium, both meet on [[Quar]], a neutral Imperial client state located in the gap between the two polities, in the [[Cronor Subsector]] of the [[Spinward Marches]].

Most Solomani worlds refuse to allow the Imperium an embassy on the grounds that they have never recognized the existence of the Solomani Confederation. The Imperium steadfastly refers to the region as either the Solomani Autonomous Region or the Solomani Sphere. However, the moderate Boötean Federation often holds summit meetings between the two sides on its capital at Hamilcar. Likewise, the Imperium has invited members of the Solomani Party and various factions from the Confederation to meet at the Imperial Centre of Peace and Diplomacy on Terra.

Imperial embassies focus on evangelising their core values: free trade, peaceable relations and the tenets of Imperial law. Cultural exchanges and political conferences are common occurrences. Embassies are also used for clandestine communication and espionage functions, although both sides either play down or deny this to be true.

Ultimately, the Imperium wants trading partners, not enemies. The empire was founded on the principles of free trade and the benefits derived from commerce between worlds. Conflict and war, especially on an interstellar scale, are expensive activities that the Imperium works hard to avoid. When war is required, the Imperial doctrine is to defeat enemy navies and occupy their worlds, suing for peace after victory is (hopefully) achieved. Overly destructive orbital bombardments and the use of weapons of mass destruction are generally avoided in modern times, although the Imperium has not outwardly prohibited such actions and maintains immense arsenals of nuclear, chemical and other destructive weapons.

## Internal Relations

The Imperium is currently at peace, but it is impossible to keep 11,000 worlds happy all the time. Friction occurs between sectors of the Imperium, subsectors of each sector and often between worlds. In the latter case, squabbles can result in armed conflict, which are usually resolved by the parties involved without Imperial interference.

Internal conflicts are localised as best they can be. Armed conflicts between blocs of worlds or subsectors are forbidden; such things can easily get out of hand. The Imperium has suffered one major revolt, many minor revolts and one civil war over the course of its history and it acts quickly and decisively to ensure such things do not happen again.

Rival nobles have conflicts with one another from time to time but must be careful not to let things escalate lest a superior noble or even the Emperor becomes involved. Noble patents and fiefs are not distributed equitably, nor are worlds or lands granted under enfeoffment always equivalent in value or prestige. It is not uncommon for nobles to become envious of each other’s fiefs. Conflicts are usually resolved through official channels, but some degree of skullduggery sometimes happens. Rival nobles are not permitted to declare war on one another, but they can and sometimes do manipulate the governments under their administrations into doing so. Noble conflicts can become personal, sometimes quite literally. The practice of duelling between individual nobles is frowned upon, but nonetheless occurs from time to time.

There are a few hot spots in the Imperium worthy of mention. The Domain of Deneb has always been a hotbed for conflict. The duchies of Deneb are highly contentious with one another and the Spinward Marches has always felt a bit neglected by Capital. To express their grievances, not one but two of its Grand Admirals travelled to Capital during the Civil War to claim the throne by force. The League of Antares has always had a strong independent streak. The region changed hands multiple times during the Pacification Campaigns and Julian War. Likewise, the Domain of Ilelish remains a troubled region where a widespread revolt once had to be put down.

Keeping the Imperium together is a constant challenge. While the Emperors and the Moot have done essentially what they set out to do – build a massive empire based on free trade and the defense of the space between its worlds – there are many more issues to deal with. Maintaining unity has always been the bane of the Emperor’s role and he must be vigilant lest it slip from his grasp.
