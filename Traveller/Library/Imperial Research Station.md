# IMPERIAL RESEARCH STATIONS

The Imperium maintains a number of research installations in the Marches. Most are mundane laboratories in cities of high-population, high-tech worlds, where the staff go home to very ordinary lives at the end of the day. Others are corporate laboratories on contract to the Imperium or military facilities located at army or naval bases.

Most do important but unexciting work, such as developing improved targeting software for naval applications or pushing the envelope of gravitic technology to wring an extra tenth of a percent efficiency out of gravitic systems. However, there are a number of less ordinary installations that conduct highly secret research.

These installations are located in remote areas of inhabited planets or outsystem worlds, and designated by a Greek letter (such as [[Research Station Gamma]]]] located on [[Vanejen]] in the [[Rhylanor subsector]]). Access is restricted; the surrounding area is normally considered a Red Zone and anyone visiting without a permit is liable to be arrested and punished for the violation. Lethal force is and can be used against anyone declining to surrender.

The nature of research undertaken at these facilitates is highly classified. Most specialise in one area, but this is not always the case, and wild theories exist about what any given installation does. Most concern exciting subjects like psionics research, biochemical warfare and investigation of Ancients devices. All that is known for certain is that these installations are highly secure and that a lot of money is spent on them. Budgetary allocations are not available for scrutiny other than by a very select group of personnel within the Bureaucracy.
