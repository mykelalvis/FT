# I NTRODUCTION

Humans have always been great explorers, first of
their homeworld and then of the wider cosmos. The
rise of the Solomani Confederation made it inevitable
that expeditions would be pushed out in any available
direction. This was mostly rimward for political
reasons. Coreward was already explored and, in any
case, the territory of the Third Imperium. Exploring
that was a matter of either taking a commercial
starship passage or committing an act of war. The
Hive Federation to trailing and the Aslan Hierate to
spinward imposed similar considerations. The rimward
frontier, however, was wide open.

Exploring out towards the galactic rim was beneficial
for multiple reasons. Expansion into nearby systems
has been ongoing since the Solomani people first
emerged from their homeworld and will likely continue
unabated. Exploration permits dangers to be avoided
by colony missions and good sites to be selected.
Resource-rich systems and habitable worlds can
be claimed with a token settlement and developed
later. There is always the possibility of encountering
a potential ally or making discoveries that grant a
technological edge over the Imperium. Persistent
rumours point to the search for a new home beyond
the reach of the Imperium or where a utopian society
can be established.

It is likely that the Hivers and Aslan have carried
out long-range exploration rimward but have not
shared their findings with other polities. The Solomani
Confederation is no more open about its efforts but
observation by Imperial intelligence agencies, and
general interaction between states, have uncovered
some details. Much of what is presented in this
volume remains known only within the Confederation,
however, and some is highly secret. If the Solomani
Confederation discovers something incredible out on
the rim, others will learn of it much later and in highly
distorted form.

A rimward campaign is likely to include a great deal
of exploration of the unknown. This could include
charting an entirely unknown region of space, trying to
find a cure for a disease that is killing a Minor Race or
producing a set of academic papers on the life cycle
and habits of several exciting new types of burrowing
mammals. It is possible to undertake exploration on
a ‘go that way and see what tries to kill you’ basis but
this is not usually all that effective. Travellers who
collect information and make a good plan are more
likely to succeed – not to mention come back alive –
than those who just pile in.

The most obvious campaign theme has the
Travellers operating aboard an exploration ship or
conducting missions from one of the forward bases.
However, the focus could instead be on a world-
taming expedition on a single distant planet, or the
trials and tribulations of a supply crew carrying out
a ‘Rim Run’ from the Solomani Confederation to
one of the forward bases. All manner of problems
might present themselves: mutinous crewmembers
and a captain on the verge of a breakdown, a
Solomani Security detachment that suddenly wants a
diversion to an unexplored planet well off the known
corridor, intrigue and politics with a newly discovered
starfaring species... or all of the above and more.
It is a long way from Confederation space to the
forward exploration bases.

Given the nature of a rimward campaign, some
additional game mechanics are necessary. These
are based on those presented in the Deep Space

world creation system from the Traveller Core Rulebook
if that seems desirable, bearing in mind that there will
be few inhabited worlds in the Rimward Region and
Tech Levels of any encountered peoples are likely to be
well below those typical in Charted Space.

A NOTE ABOUT THE SOLOMANI
The Solomani have at times been portrayed as violently
racist ‘Space Nazis’. The author would prefer to believe
that such a society could not succeed in the long term.
More importantly, it is entirely unplayable for reasons
that should be obvious. The answer to this problem was
to re-evaluate the Solomani people in light of the fact
that the Charted Space universe is generally viewed
from an Imperium-centric position.

Imperial propaganda portrays the Solomani people
as thoroughly unpleasant, and there is some basis
in truth to what they say. The Solomani do think they
are better than everyone else and they do have some
racist policies. However, they are not jackbooted
haters. Most Solomani people are entirely willing to
acknowledge the worth of aliens and non-Solomani,
and become good friends with them. Perhaps the
best example is an Imperial noble who thinks they
are better than others because they were born into
the right bloodline, with all wealth and privilege, but
is willing to acknowledge the talent and dedication of
someone from a lower background. A Solomani has
exactly the same attitude and for the same reason –
only the bloodline is not a narrow one going back to
an ennobled ancestor; it is the grand bloodline of the
children of Old Earth!

The Solomani, as a people, can be a little patronising
towards outsiders. They expect more of their own
people than of non-Solomani and recognise a racial
‘call to greatness’ that others do not experience. This
leads to an expectation that pure-blooded Solomani will
occupy leadership positions and show everyone else
the way. This is still racism but it is of a complex sort
that rarely manifests as arbitrary hate. The implications
of that are something for Solomani Travellers to
explore. One question that might be asked are the
Imperials really any better? They think their nobility are
something special whilst the Solomani believe their
whole civilisation is exceptional. Is social injustice really
any different anywhere?

###### Introduction

There are many reasons to explore. Simple curiosity
is only one of them, although it is important. Some
people, and some cultures, are driven to know what is
on the other side of that hill just because they do not
know. Often, curiously of this sort is intertwined with
hope – what point is there in going to look at far-off
places if one is certain there will be nothing to see?
The desire to explore, then, is a symbol of hope for
the future. The explorer hopes to discover something
of interest, or profit, or perhaps to find a better place
to live. It has been suggested that once a society has
ceased to explore, it has ceased to hope.

This is a huge generalisation, of course, and can be
misinterpreted. A culture that never leaves its village
but pushes the boundaries of philosophy is exploring,
although in a very different manner. One that explores
new realms of science and technology has not ceased
to develop. Yet there is a point where a society
ceases to push outward in any direction – physical,
metaphysical or scientific – and begins to stagnate.
One of the stagnation-indicators is how money is spent.
When more is spent on ways of concentrating wealth
in the hands of a few than on pushing outward in any
direction, a society has reached the end of its life span.
It is only a matter of time before the collapse begins.

This, according to Solomani observers at least, is what
happened to empires from the Romans to the Vilani.
Both reached a point where external threats were very
far away and could easily be ignored. Both came to
prize stability over progress. Both internalised external
events for the gain of powerful individuals and groups. A
barbarian uprising on the frontier was no longer a threat
to the empire; it was an opportunity for someone to
make money on an arms contract or discredit a rival for
supposed poor handling of the situation. The Solomani
Confederation aims to learn from these lessons,
constantly pushing out to prevent collapse from within.

There are other reasons to explore than simple
curiosity. Finding new resources and new territories is
usually beneficial, and learning about threats when they
are small or distant can be vital. How different history
might have been if the Vilani Imperium had explored
just beyond its frontiers a little more thoroughly! The
difficulties posed by long-range exploration have led to
technological and procedural developments which have

# T HE OUTWARD URGE

in turn affected the Solomani Confederation as a whole.
For the most part, although, the Solomani people are
compelled to explore and push outward simply because
‘it’s there’. Some refer to this as The Outward Urge, in
reference to an ancient tale from Old Terra.

EARLY TERRAN EXPLORATION
The ancestors of modern humans wandered where
they needed in search of food and resources. It is
known that tool-making proto-humans reached the
northern extremities of Europe around 100,000 years
before the present. This was not exploration in the
grand sense; it was scouting by a mobile community
which then headed for the best prospects in terms
of food and shelter. This small-scale model of scout-
led nomadism characterises some space exploration
missions, straddling the divide between border creep,
organised exploration and transient occupation of an
area to exploit its resources. A tribe of hunter-gatherers
on ancient Earth might use similar methods to a belter
community moving from one prospective motherlode
to another. However, for exploration to be meaningful
in the wider sense the data gathered must be sent
back for use by someone. This model does not always
support the wider exploration programme.

The Last Ice Age – perhaps better referred to as the
Most Recent Period of Glaciation – reached its peak
around -25,000 by the Imperial calendar, driving
human populations far south before the glaciers
retreated. What followed was a period of migration
into lands changed by the ice; a migration that was in
part an exploration of a world made anew. Humans
achieved behavioural modernity during this period
and it is arguable that this was the most significant
event in human history. Had it occurred under different
circumstances the Solomani people might have had a
different underlying mindset. Instead, they awoke in a
world cleansed and made anew. It was theirs for the
taking, and so they did.

From tribal migrations back into Europe and across
Asia, humans spread across the globe. They found
wonders and dangers; a remote continent where
seemingly every living thing was poisonous or hostile,
vast deserts, forbidding mountain ranges. They
explored island chains and set out from them in ocean-

going canoes on one-way trips. Many died in the
remote seas but some discovered new lands at the
very outer edge of their endurance. Now they knew
it was possible, they paddled back and forth in open
boats on the vast ocean.

Humans settled every land they could survive in and
searched for more. As technology advanced they
voyaged in greater safety, only to find their ‘new’ lands
were populated by those who had done more with less.
Wars of conquest or greed were inevitable but at the
same time voyages of discovery brought enlightenment
and the advancement of society. Exploration advanced
science, and vice versa, and spawned tales of heroic
endeavour. A mountain expedition almost met disaster
and resulted in an understanding of air pressure and
altitude sickness. An exploration crew whose ship
became trapped in ice self-rescued under impossible
circumstances, showing others what can be done with
nothing more than grit and ingenuity. Endeavour was
rewarded, creating a self-fulfilling cycle.

The exploration of Old Earth is considered by many
to be the heart of the Solomani psyche. The species’
earliest experiences were of new lands and wonders
to be seen, of dangers barely averted and tales
shared around the fire about them. Some Solomani
will say that the reason they are superior to all other
humans is that those others were ‘given the stars for
free, whilst we had to look under every rock on the
way there’. This is a common Solomani philosophy;
that they are what Humaniti was supposed to be,
having taken the hard road and done everything for
themselves. It is an argument not without some merit
but extremely irritating to those whose route onto the
cosmic stage was just as difficult.

THE FIRST^

INTERSTELLAR EXPEDITIONS

Naturally, exploration did not end with the surface of
Terra. The first orbital satellite was launched in -2564.
At this time the population of Terra was still divided into
rival national powers. Competition between the major
powers led to a ‘space race’ that saw orbital missions
followed by expeditions to Terra’s moon and probes
launched throughout the solar system.

The emphasis gradually shifted, toward the sort of
stagnation feared by the modern Solomani people.
Plans to colonise other bodies in the system were
shelved as too expensive or not worth the risk, and
emphasis shifted to making money from orbital space.
Commercial satellite launches, and eventually small

specialist factories in orbit, provided a good return
for the corporations that ran them but there was no
money to be made from cleaning up any mess they
made. Orbital space became cluttered with debris
and crowded with satellites, to the point where an
international body was formed to direct orbital traffic
and clear some of the debris that endangered craft
moving through the orbital zone.

This was the United Nations Space Coordination Agency
(UNSCA). It started with a remit to make orbital traffic
safer and enforce international law in space, although
gradually expanded into a coordinating body for global
endeavours such as planetary defence against asteroid
strikes. UNSCA became a clearinghouse for scientific
and technical information on space operations and
techniques, and as renewed interest led to colonisation
and exploitation projects on other bodies in the solar
system, its remit naturally expanded.

UNSCA was at the forefront of a new wave of in-
system exploration. Its scientists developed a reliable
manoeuvre drive which opened up the far reaches
of the solar system for exploration and plans were
drawn up for a sublight mission to another star system.
The first of these was the European Union’s Europa.
Others were launched and underway when another
breakthrough rendered them obsolete. In -2439 an
UNSCA laboratory developed a prototype jump drive.

As the sublight missions crawled out towards Alpha
Centauri and other nearby star systems, jump-capable
ships began reliable operations between parts of
the solar system too distant for manoeuvre drive
vessels. Shorter trips were more efficiently made
by conventional ships and for a time the jump drive
seemed like something of a dead end. Possessing
only a one-parsec jump range and with the nearest
systems beyond that, the nations of Terra did not at first
comprehend how much the jump drive would change
their view of the universe.

In -2425, the [[Terra|Terran]]s launched their first interstellar
mission. The was the American vessel StarLeaper 1.
Its destination was Barnard’s Star rather than Alpha
Centauri, so as not to upstage the sublight missions
launched 15 years previously. Using a deep space fuel
cache built up by support vessels, StarLeaper 1 made
the historic crossing to Barnard’s Star... and discovered
there were people already there.

Barnard was the site of a small Vilani prospecting
base, a minor outpost of the Vilani Empire: the Ziru
Sirka or Grand Empire of Stars. Many thousands of
years ago, the Vilani branch of Humaniti, placed on
the planet Vland by the Ancients, had invented the

###### The Outward Urge

TRAVELLER

jump drive themselves. They used this technology to
expand through a vast region of space, encountering
conquering and assimilating many other human and
alien civilisations in the process. By the time they
encountered the [[Terra|Terran]]s, their society had stagnated.
There were no significant threats along the borders,
just a few spacegoing barbarian cultures that could be
kept in line or swatted by local forces.

The Vilani were entirely complacent about these new
spacefarers in their primitive vessels, whilst the [[Terra|Terran]]s
were galvanised into action. Nations expanded their
space forces and began building military and civilian
starships, opening trade links with the Vilani Imperium.
Although the Vilani were two Tech Levels ahead of
the [[Terra|Terran]]s’ TL9, a rush to reverse-engineer devices
bought from the Vilani – not always through the proper
channels – permitted rapid development.

Conflict was inevitable. The Vilani viewed the [[Terra|Terran]]s
as backward and unpromising, at best a market
for Vilani goods. The [[Terra|Terran]]s reasoned that it was
inevitable they would be assimilated and prepared to
resist. The [[Terra|Terran]] habit of trading with anyone they
pleased rather than following Vilani trade protocols
angered Imperial officials, whilst a growing movement
on Terra demanded a ‘fair share’ of local star systems.

‘EXPLORATION’ OF THE IMPERIUM
Conflict began in -2408, with what the Vilani Imperium
considered a minor border incident. In response, a
punitive expedition was sent to put the [[Terra|Terran]]s in their
place and did so easily. The uncoordinated forces of
various [[Terra|Terran]] nations were easily overwhelmed by a
Vilani flotilla of minor patrol vessels and escorts, which
returned home confident the barbarians had learned
their lesson. They had but not the one the Vilani
Imperium had intended to teach.

To the [[Terra|Terran]]s, it was the worst-case scenario – war
with the mighty Vilani Imperium. National forces
attempted to strike back, inadvertently confusing the
Vilani strategists. Different design philosophies and
ship tactics made it hard to predict what the [[Terra|Terran]]s
might do and whilst the forces of the [[Terra|Terran]] nations
were generally defeated, they were not crushed.
Lessons were learned about Vilani military capability
and the need for a unified command.

Four years after the initial incident, another fleet
engagement was fought. Predictable tactics placed
elements of the Vilani fleet in a position to be
overwhelmed by massed firepower whilst other units

were drawn off by deception or hit-and-run attacks. The
battle was costly for both sides but the [[Terra|Terran]]s were
willing to take the losses and keep fighting – or more
accurately, they thought they had no choice but to do so.

For their part, the Vilani officials commanding the
punitive expedition were dismayed at the losses
they had received and did not consider defeating the
[[Terra|Terran]]s to be worth the cost. They were already in
the awkward position of having to explain the losses
they had taken, which was politically damaging.
Faced with a choice between battling on with what
they had or the humiliation of requesting additional
forces to deal with some trivial barbarians, they
chose what seemed like the best option.

The [[Terra|Terran]]s needed time to make good their losses;
the Vilani commanders wanted to end the fighting
and claim they had won to avoid damage to their
reputations. Thus an unofficial armistice was agreed
and both sides stepped back. Peace of a sort returned
to the region in -2400. It was both uneasy and short but
during this period the nations of Terra came together,
along with their colonies, first as the United Worlds and
then as the [[Terra|Terran]] Confederation.

Renewed conflict saw territory change hands and
[[Terra|Terran]] power grow. Vilani provincial governors were
embarrassed by the losses they had suffered and tried
to cover up or downplay the clashes, preferring to make
concessions to the external threat rather than give internal
rivals ammunition. This internalisation of external events
was ultimately the downfall of the Vilani Imperium.

Despite setbacks and a nuclear bombardment of
Terra herself, the [[Terra|Terran]] Confederation continued
to nibble away at Vilani power. Over the course of
six Interstellar Wars, Terra captured worlds whose
industry could produce weapons and starships
equivalent to anything the Imperials had. In between
the wars, the exploration of the Vilani Imperium
began. It was carried out by traders, smugglers and
sometimes naval reconnaissance vessels rather than
scout ships, but an exploration it was nonetheless.
Traders pushed into Imperial territory, making friends
with those who chafed under Imperial rule and
undermining the fabric of the Imperium itself.

This destabilisation was the cause of the Sixth
Interstellar War. A weakened provincial government led
to increased piracy and the pirates were not choosy
about who they attacked. Raids into [[Terra|Terran]] space
brought about retaliation which somehow became a
major campaign into Vilani space. In -2321 the local
Vilani governor sued for peace to protect his capital

###### The Outward Urge

and appealed to the Emperor for assistance. When
this response finally arrived it triggered the Seventh
Interstellar War, which ended in -2308 with an armistice
in favour of the [[Terra|Terran]]s.

The flavour of the conflict changed during this time,
with [[Terra|Terran]] technology outstripping that of the Vilani
Imperium. Production of jump-3 capable capital ships
gave the [[Terra|Terran]]s a strategic advantage they had not
previously possessed and victories in major fleet battles
inspired previously cowed populations to rebel against
the Imperium. [[Terra|Terran]] forces pushed through Vilani
space in pursuit of retreating foes, essentially exploring
the Imperium by conquering it.

The final phase of the Interstellar Wars era was
characterised by local treaties negotiated by naval
commanders, many of which were broken before news
of them reached Terra. The Vilani Imperium began to
collapse, requiring [[Terra|Terran]] naval forces to learn about
a new region in order to secure its main assets and
restore order. As the Vilani Imperium gave way to the
Rule of Man, naval assets were all that was available
to govern vast regions of space. Warships were sent
on information-gathering and scouting missions,
establishing a new mission for the [[Terra|Terran]] Navy. Where
other powers developed a dedicated explorations
service the [[Terra|Terran]]s used what they had and to this day,
exploration remains an important naval mission.

EXPLORATION AND^

EXODUS IN THE LONG NIGHT

Ultimately, the Vilani Imperium was too fragile to
be propped up by an overstretched [[Terra|Terran]] navy.
The collapse was not immediate, nor complete,
nor uniform but by -1776 the institutions of the old
Imperium were unable to function. Piracy and minor
wars broke the connections between major worlds,
with each defending itself as best it could. These
worlds became hubs for trade and sometimes the
centre of a pocket empire. Some of these endured
what became known as the Long Night, while others
collapsed to mid-Tech Level or lower.

Even whilst this collapse was occurring, and in some
cases because of it, missions were launched to learn
more about distant regions. Colonisation expeditions
also set out. Some Vilani worlds launched missions,
mostly to spinward-coreward, in the hope of finding a
homeworld beyond the reach of the [[Terra|Terran]] conquerors.
For their part, the [[Terra|Terran]]s launched some long-range
missions but most of these were unsanctioned by the
central government on Terra. Missions were for the

most part local in origin, with a mix of [[Terra|Terran]] and Vilani
people aboard. Some of these missions went to trailing-
coreward and ended up on the shores of the Lesser Rift

- or perhaps even beyond it. Some may have wandered

into or even through the territory of other major powers.
It is known that missions were sent out to rimward,
although details of all these expeditions are sketchy as
records were completely lost or deliberately destroyed.

The fate of some of these missions will never be known.
Others were discovered long after the Long Night ended,
often in a regressed state. Around 2,000 years passed
between the launch of the so-called ‘Twilight Exodus’
from the collapsing Rule of Man and the arrival of scouts
from the Third Imperium in the regions targeted by the
colony missions. That was time for some to flourish,
developing into a starfaring civilisation, and for others to
regress to barbarism.

EXPLORATION IN^

THE IMPERIAL YEARS
At the time the Third Imperium was founded, in
what is now known as Year 0, a few small starfaring
powers existed. One was the Sylean Federation,
which founded the new Imperium and whose scouts
contacted the others. Another was the Old Earth Union.
This was a successor state to the [[Terra|Terran]] Mercantile
Community, an economic power that maintained trade
and communication across most of the Solomani Rim.

The Old Earth Union lost control of some of the
sector but was able to establish a stable government
over the remainder. It possessed one of the few
real navies of the era and from -1110 to 558 was
the major power in the region. Although its focus
was internal, the Old Earth Union maintained a
naval reconnaissance force tasked with locating
threats along the borders and establishing relations
with worlds that seemed receptive. ‘Trade in force’
missions were sometimes mounted, forcing corridors
through to target worlds. These might or might not
last; economic factors could curtail external trade
and occasionally hostile action became a factor.

When Sylean scouts contacted the Old Earth Union
it became desirable to push a trade corridor through.
Reconnaissance of the worlds in this corridor and to
each side became a major focus, requiring assets
that had been in use elsewhere. The endeavour was
a success, to the benefit of both Sylea and Terra. The
Old Earth Union expanded a little over time, whilst
the Sylean Federation – now styling itself the Third
Imperium – was more aggressive. In 588 the two

###### The Outward Urge

TRAVELLER

merged. The Imperials would say the Old Earth Union
joined the Imperium or ‘was absorbed into it’ but it
retained its distinctive character and culture.

As part of the Third Imperium, exploration from the
region around Terra emphasised the rimward direction.
The Imperium was largely concerned with worlds that
had been within the old Vilani Imperium and did not
look far outside its borders. This is unsurprising; there
were thousands of worlds to be reintegrated. The
Imperial Interstellar Scout Service was fully occupied
with surveying and contacting these, or setting up
new colonies on worlds that might be important to
future strategy. The Imperial border was pushed out to
spinward in the region ‘behind the claw’ to prevent local
powers – notably the Zhodani Consulate – from taking
control of those systems.

Although the emphasis was elsewhere, some
exploration to rimward was undertaken. As part of
the Third Imperium, the people of the [[Terra|Terran]] region
followed Imperial practice. Exploration was the
preserve of the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service.
However, the focus of the IISS was distinctly local.
Longer-range missions were undertaken by private

concerns. Data gathered by these missions was shared
with the IISS as a matter of course, since Imperial
regulations required it. Once relations between [[Terra|Terran]]s
and the Imperium began to cool, however, transfers of
information became less diligent.

EXPLORATION IN^

THE POST-IMPERIAL YEARS
Over time, the former Old Earth Union became a
less enthusiastic member of the Third Imperium.
Concessions were granted which allowed the
formation of the Solomani Autonomous Region,
which subsequently reinvented itself as the Solomani
Confederation. This caused tensions between the
Imperium and the Confederation, and for a time a
strange situation existed in which the Confederation had
sort of seceded and the Imperium was sort of ignoring
the fact. Eventually matters came to a head and the
Imperium attempted to exert control. This was partially
successful; Terra was captured by the Imperium during
the Solomani Rim War of 990–1002 but the remainder of
the Confederation stayed independent.

In the years since independence, the Solomani
Confederation has gradually reverted to its old practices.
Large amounts of Scout Service equipment were seized
when the Confederation became independent but this
is now over a century old and has for the most part
been phased out. A deliberate programme of replacing
Imperial designs with Solomani ones has increased
the pace of removal from official service. This has put
a great many scout/couriers and other Scout Service
vessels in private hands. Some are used for exploration
work but most have been repurposed.

The Solomani Confederation has undertaken a great
deal of exploration rimward. Some of this can be
considered politico-economic in nature, in that the
intent is to find resource-rich worlds to colonise and
develop. Some is specific, such as expeditions to sites
of scientific interest. However, there is also a great
deal of general exploration – some of it quite grand
in scope. The most well-known Solomani rimward
endeavour is the Perseus Arm expeditions, a series of
missions intended to cross the gap to the next spiral
arm out. Little information is publicly available about
the findings of these missions or even why they were
launched. There are, after all, countless new worlds to
be discovered much closer to home.

###### The Outward Urge

Exploration is carried out by a variety of organisations,
many of them privately owned. The Confederation
Navy has never relinquished its role as the overseeing
authority for exploration and since all charting and
survey operations come under this banner its remit
is broader than might be expected. Confederation
law requires that all survey data be submitted to the
local exploration office of the Confederation Navy.
This means that every time a prospecting ship probes
an asteroid the navy wants to know about it. On one
hand this creates a lot of data-handling that might not
be relevant to the navy’s usual mission of protecting
the Confederation. However, blanket data-gathering
produces a great deal of information that may be
useful to the intelligence community and routinely
conceals the interest of the Confederation authorities
in a particular region.

THE CONFEDERATION NAVY^

AS EXPLORERS
The Confederation Navy undertakes or leads all
Confederation-wide exploration attempts. In many
cases an expedition will be staffed entirely by serving
naval personnel, although sometimes specialists are
brought in from other organisations. These may be
given a short version of basic naval or officer training
and assigned rank, or they may be granted the status
of attached civilians. In the former case, personnel
are slotted into the naval chain of command whereas
civilians remain outside it.

Most of the exploration ships used by the Confederation
Navy are older warships which have been withdrawn
from combat service. Typically a vessel will be converted
and refitted if it is intended for long-duration missions.
However, much of the exploration mission is internal or
close to the borders of the Confederation and carried
out by regular navy ships. Assignment to chart asteroid
fields or conduct a scientific analysis of a gas giant’s
composition is commonplace.

Naval vessels do not ‘switch roles’ when undertaking
these tasks – internal or short-range exploration is
part of the naval mission. There is not much difference
between scouting a new system and conducting a

survey of outsystem worlds in search of pirate bases.
All warships are equipped for these missions and at
times the exploration role is useful as a cover for other
activities. Likewise, even converted exploration ships
are well armed and crewed by fighting spacers.

As a result of this policy, all naval personnel have at
least some experience with exploration tasks. Many will
be assigned to a dedicated exploration ship for a period
before moving back to the ‘fighting navy’, although
for commanding officers the move to exploration is
long-term or permanent. Some have returned from
exploration duty, especially in times of need, but for the
most part the training investment in an officer dictates
where they will serve the remainder of their career.

Crews assigned to mid-range exploration work are
often combat experienced. With relatively few ships
scattered over a vast area, crises have to be dealt
with using whatever resources are available. A TL
world with a few gunboats might not be a threat
to the assembled fleets of the Confederation but
if all the local commander has to work with is an
old destroyer and a couple of auxiliaries this force
becomes a credible threat.

The short- and mid-range exploration mission is
inextricably intertwined with power projection. Data
on star systems and the people who live in them is
of scientific interest, of course, but it is also strategic
intelligence and threat analysis. The infrastructure
required to support extended missions necessitates the
construction of bases, which inevitably become hubs
for trade and development of the surrounding area.

SOLSEC
Solomani Security, or SolSec, is as active in the
exploration field as anywhere else. Naval ships
are always assigned a political officer, or at least a
crewmember with some political training, and these
personnel are invaluable in determining the ramifications
of interactions with people encountered during a mission.
SolSec is also responsible for ensuring the loyalty of
crews and installations far from home.

TRAVELLER

SolSec thus has a strong presence at forward bases,
with a significant intelligence-analysis capability.
Waiting for a team back in the Confederation to figure
out if a threat exists then send word all the way back
is impractical. Analysis is conducted on the spot and
conclusions fed back to the Confederation along with
the raw data. Predictions are made about whether a
threat will emerge in a given region, although in most
cases the conclusion is that nothing needs to be done
for a century or two, if ever.

SolSec also embeds personnel in private exploration
crews, not always openly. Whilst private concerns are
not required by law to take Monitors with them, there
is a lot of pressure to do so and those that do not are
often passed over for future government contracts.
Despite their sinister reputation, SolSec personnel
generally contribute a great deal to a mission. Their
insight into politics is often useful and they can guide
an organisation through the process of getting approval
for missions, equipment purchases and development
opportunities in new areas.

SolSec are also adept at maintaining crew morale and
loyalty, which can be essential on a long expedition. Fear
of the lurking SolSec Monitor is sometimes effective but
most assigned personnel prefer to take a more positive
role. In many cases the Monitor is an organiser of
recreational activities and an advocate for crewmembers
who may be struggling with aspects of the mission.

OTHER EXPLORERS
A few of the Confederation’s universities are rich
enough to outfit exploration and scientific vessels.
Most cannot do so but will contract corporate or
private ship operators. More commonly, institutions
are represented by experts aboard a naval vessel.
These are usually attached civilians but sometimes
a stint aboard an exploration ship is part of the
education programme for someone intending to enter
a naval career after university. Scholars may also be
hired by a corporation, or a corporate exploration ship
may be chartered by a university.

The Solomani Confederation has a great many
corporate bodies which engage in exploration, although
there are few that make it their sole business. These
generally operate on contract to the central government
but sometimes put together an expedition to suit the
needs of multiple backers. These ‘mongrel missions’
can become complex, especially when some of
the backers drop out or change their requirements.
However, a multi-client expedition is often the only way
to obtain funding for an otherwise desirable objective.

Most of the private exploration that is undertaken has
specific goals, which are almost always economic.
A corporation might investigate a region to discover
potential markets or search for highly productive
asteroid mining locations. Additional data can usually
be sold to other interested parties, although this is not
always desirable. Exploration is expensive but some
corporations have gained huge advantages by being
the first to discover a new or rich resource.

Corporations generally prefer to recruit experienced
personnel, often from a naval background, but most
have a training programme of some kind. Promising
candidates will often be sponsored through university
in return for several years of service aboard an
exploration vessel. Boredom is a motivator for some;
corporate recruiters routinely comb the dullest
employment sectors for people who will jump at
the chance of a new start. These tend not to be
academically gifted individuals but common sense and
a willingness to work hard are always useful.

Corporate missions generally carry some liaison
personnel from the navy and SolSec, and occasionally
a joint expedition is undertaken. This can become
complicated in terms of command style and overall
objectives but as a rule, the corporations will go along
with what the navy says if the fee is high enough or
there is another clear benefit. Employees might not like
it but a contract is a contract.

INTERNAL AND^

SHORT-RANGE EXPLORATION
The term ‘exploration’ is loosely used as a catch-
all for all missions intended to obtain information
of a non-military sort. This includes mapping new
areas as well as chart-updating, investigation of
specific characteristics such as ice composition on
an outsystem moon and verification of data about the
Confederation’s member worlds or those just outside its
borders. Some of these tasks might be termed ‘internal
reconnaissance’ or ‘survey and charting’ work but all
come under the banner of the exploration mission
rather than internal security or warfighting.

Intelligence-gathering missions across the border into
neighbouring states are not included in this definition
since there is a greater risk of hostilities. In short, a
ship with exploration orders is wary but assumes a
peacetime situation. Reconnaissance or intelligence-
gathering assumes potential hostility and, of course,
warfighting is outright hostile.

Confederation Exploration Policy

The Confederation considers all non-aligned star
systems within 20 parsecs of its borders to lie within
the remit of its short-range exploration assets.
Visits to these systems are fairly common and near-
complete data is held on all major bodies in the
system. Ring systems and planetoid belts may not
have been charted in any detail but composition and
the presence of dwarf planets will more than likely be
known. Systems that lie within starfaring powers will
also have been mapped by various means, mostly
using trade or diplomatic ships or simply buying the
data on the local nets.

Unless a system’s population is hostile, contact with
worlds in the 20-parsec zone is routine. Naval vessels
may visit on ‘goodwill’ or ‘flag-showing’ missions
but most interactions are by way of commerce. The
Confederation subsidises merchant lines to include
even quite minor worlds in their trans-border routes,
ensuring a steady trickle of Confederation goods into
local markets. There is no specific plan behind these
activities; the intent is to create a situation in which
goodwill exists when the Confederation has a use for it
and to prevent rivals from gaining too much influence
over non-aligned worlds.

Many worlds in the 20-parsec zone are sufficiently
friendly that they host a Confederation commercial
or even military presence. Mutual assistance treaties
permit Confederation vessels to use local ports
for more than a simple stopover and naturally the
presence of Confederation assets brings in additional
money. However, the Solomani Party is not actively
seeking expansion in this region. The border creeps
out a little from time–to–time, but the Confederation
does not need large numbers of what are often termed
‘burden systems’. Every new world assimilated into
the Confederation must be protected and in most
cases significant investment will be required before the
system becomes an economic asset.

The Solomani Confederation does want to expand but
the emphasis is on value rather than bulk. Medium-
range exploration is generally directed towards
finding prime worlds or valuable clusters. Ideally, a
chain of hubs can be set up, from which neighbouring
worlds will be exploited or perhaps colonised. The
Confederation does not feel the need to claim every
rockball it charts and is quite happy to move its trade
ships through wide areas of unaligned space. There
are also ideological considerations – outsiders with the
right attitudes are desirable as new members but those
that do not subscribe to Solomani ideals might better
be kept at arm’s length.

COREWARD AND^

TRAILINGWARD EXPLORATION
Some exploration work is undertaken in a coreward and
trailingward direction, through the non-aligned regions
between Solomani and Hiver territory, and towards
the region just beyond the Imperial frontier – the
Crucis Margin and Gateway sectors in particular. The
Confederation is more interested in passively opposing
Imperial expansion in these areas than gaining territory
of its own, not least because the K’kree pose a threat
to the region. Current policy is to ‘harden’ the worlds of
Gateway and Crucis Margin against both powers but to
avoid entanglements that could result in being drawn
into a territorial conflict.

Exploration and ‘commercial survey operations’ into
this region are conducted with legitimate aims but
also cover the movement of warships and provision
of support for friendly powers in Gateway and Crucis
Margin. There is nothing illegal about these missions
but it is considered preferable that the Imperials do
not know just what – if anything – the Confederation
is doing. Imperial vid shows often portray hidden
Confederation bases packed with commerce raiders
just waiting to charge into Imperial space and start
causing mayhem. The reality is rather less grandiose
but the Confederation does have a policy of locating
suitable sites for forward staging areas. Exploration
of a gas giant’s moon system may well be legitimate
scientific work but the data is also available to the
Confederation’s strategic planners.

Missions are occasionally launched coreward of Imperial
space. Permission has at times been granted for a
Confederation scientific expedition to pass through
the Imperium and out its coreward side, however the
Confederation prefers not to ask the Imperials for anything
and would rather go around by way of Gateway. This
necessitates maintaining good relations with the powers
of Gateway but since that aligns with the Confederation’s
strategic aims in the region it is not hard to obtain backing
for long-range trade missions into the sector.

Although there are solid reasons for maintaining a
presence and conducting exploration in the coreward-
trailing region, much greater attention is given to the
open rimward frontier. It is here, according to many
Solomani, that the future of the Confederation lies.
These individuals are unlikely to dispute that Terra must
be regained from the Imperials but Solomani power will
grow with the acquisition of resources from the frontier.
This creates a division of opinion between the ‘Terra
First’ thinkers and the ‘Terra Always, But Only When
We Can’ school of thought.

Confederation Exploration Policy

It is possible, although rather inadvisable, to conduct
exploration by jumping into a bunch of star systems
and seeing what is there. Some people actually
do proceed this way and impressive finds have
been made. However, a more methodical process
generally leads to better value for the expedition
budget and less disasters. There are typically three
stages to an exploration mission – preparation,
execution and follow-up.

The preparation phase is arguably the most
important. Running face-first into an obvious hazard
can force a mission to be aborted before anything
is achieved, whilst lesser errors may require
abandonment of later objectives. An underfunded
mission is a dangerous mission and there is always
the risk that a failed expedition will increase the
reluctance of backers to contribute or personnel to
take part. Execution can be carried out in a variety
of ways and is often subject to mission creep or
objective reduction as one discovery leads to another
or problems force an early curtailment. Often, goals
from one expedition end up being carried over into
the follow-up phase or shelved for a future mission.

THE PLANNING/PREPARATION PHASE
‘Let’s go that way!’ is a possible strategy for small
groups operating over a short distance but for the most
part an expedition begins with the establishment of an
objective. This can be a specific place or phenomenon
to be investigated or something more general.
‘Investigate the unusual radio-frequency sources
at Point QX-41044’ is a specific objective which will
probably lead to a direct mission to that point. ‘Explore
the region surrounding the Reinfaddi Cluster’ is more
general but both are equally valid.

Even at this early point, mission creep may begin to
set in. Extra value must be balanced against extra
cost or dilution of the main objective. For example,
a mission to investigate a particular stellar anomaly
might require a transit of several months to get to it.
Would it not be better to do some exploration along
the way? Could the mission not take a dogleg course
to take a look at another point of interest? The answer
is not necessarily yes. An indirect course or more
objectives means either a longer mission or less time
to be spent on the main objective.

# T HE EXPLORATION PROCESS

An expanded mission might require additional ships
and personnel, which in turn means a larger budget
and resources being unavailable elsewhere for a
longer time. This is not always desirable, or even
possible, and demands to do more with the same
budget can lead to a mission being dangerously
overstretched. There have been cases of ambitious
missions to certain points of interest which have
received funding on condition they perform all manner
of other tasks... and the end result is a mission that
performs those tasks but never fulfils its initial brief.

The planning stage usually draws on available
information from long-range sensing or previous
missions. Some of this information is easy to obtain –
stars are, after all, fairly obvious objects. It is reasonable
to assume that unless there is some good reason why
a stellar object has not been detected, the presence
of stars and their general type will be known. This
correlates as a Breakthrough Index (see page 130) of 3
for most systems out to the edge of the spiral arm and
an equivalent distance in other directions. It is possible
to obtain considerably more information by consulting
records of earlier expeditions or by remote sensing.

The most important information an expedition planner
needs is whether or not fuel is available in any given
system. The presence of gas giants is a good indication,
although some cannot be skimmed for various reasons.
Gas giants are relatively easy to detect, whereas other
sources of fuel such as ice asteroids or water-bearing
terrestrial planets may not be. Good mission planning
is based on probabilities and risk factors, so a system
that looks like it may not have fuel is not necessarily off-
limits. The mission plan can account for this by ensuring
there are other systems with a high probability of fuel
availability within range and laying out an approach that
allows for refuelling.

The planning stage comes down to deciding where
the expedition is to go and what its objectives are,
then laying out a projected route that gets the
expedition where it needs to be on a reasonable time
frame. Resources then need to be assembled: ships,
personnel and equipment, along with any necessary
permissions and access rights. Complications at
this stage can cripple an expedition or cause it to be
abandoned, although more commonly the mission

will go ahead in some form. It is generally the case
that once the planning has been done the onus is on
commanders to make it work with whatever resources
they end up being assigned.

THE EXECUTION PHASE
The execution phase is where the mission actually
happens. It is broken down into components, each
defined by its objective and what is necessary
to achieve that objective. Different parts of the
expedition will have their own character and a most
effective approach. Generally speaking, if something
unexpected happens the Travellers can be assumed
to be behaving in a way suited to their current activity
unless they have specified otherwise.

**RAPID ADVANCE**
Rapid advance is normally used in known space.
Little or no exploration work is undertaken. Data is
still collected on a routine basis but the emphasis
is on getting to the exploration area as quickly as
possible. This might mean something important is
bypassed but another mission can always be sent to
follow up promising leads.

Since the crew know fuel is available at each destination,
the route will be optimised to make best use of the
ship’s jump capability. That does not always translate to
a maximum jump each time, however. Good planning
allows a crew to make best long-term use of their
mobility. This is especially important in sparse regions or
where fuel is available only in certain locations.

A rapid advance might be made when passing through
any known area, although it is usually employed in the
initial transit to a supply base or a rendezvous with
forward-deployed support ships. Ships returning from
a long mission may choose to retrace their steps more
rapidly or ‘explore their way home’. Much depends on
the state of the ship and crew at this point.

**STANDARD ADVANCE**
The standard advance posture attempts to balance
speed of movement with the need to obtain
information. Typically ships will spend longer in each
system but this is more about remote sensing of the
next location than detailed exploration of this one.
A standard advance is used where a crew needs to
determine whether fuel is likely to be available at the
next system, and/or to learn its characteristics such as
the presence of terrestrial planets.

Ships making a standard advance can be assumed
to be doing more than relying on previously available
data. A basic investigation of the current system will
be undertaken along with remote sensing of systems
within two to four parsecs. If something interesting is
noticed, the crew may decide to explore further but
this must be balanced against the overall goals of the
expedition. Too many side trips will over-extend the
mission or force the main objective to be inadequately
explored. For this reason, points of interest are
generally logged for follow-up missions.

EXPLORATORY ADVANCE
The term exploratory advance is applied to any
situation where the mission is emphasising detailed
exploration over speed of movement. This is usually
in the latter part of the advance to the target area but
may also be done by choice or out of necessity. It
may be desirable to slow down the rate of advance in
order to thoroughly search a few systems, or it may
be necessary to find something important such as a
source of extractable minerals to conduct a repair or
for later exploitation.

A ship making an exploratory advance is more likely to
spot points of interest. This is not only due to greater
care being taken in data gathering but also the time
spent on analysing information, discussing ideas about
what it all means and being willing to hold off the next
jump for long enough to launch a surface mission.
Another key difference is that when a ship is making a
rapid or standard advance it will normally jump to the
expected fuel source, which is typically the innermost
gas giant. An exploratory advance may be conducted
differently, with the mainworld as the jump target and
refuelling to be conducted later.

SPEED OF ADVANCE
Depending on the advance posture of a ship, its
progress can vary considerably. The Speed of Advance
table gives an indication of how quickly the ship will
move through star systems under each posture. The
average monthly rate of advance assumes a jump-
vessel, the Confederation’s fleet-mobility standard.

Speed of Advance

Standard Advance 2 days 7 Parsecs
Exploratory Advance 5 days 3–4 Parsecs

###### The Exploration Process

TRAVELLER

EXPLORING A SYSTEM
Some ‘exploration’ occurs any time a ship passes
through a star system. During a rapid advance this is
usually little more than passively collecting data whilst
refuelling. Typically a ship making a standard or rapid
advance will jump directly to the gas giant selected for
refuelling and send subordinate craft to bodies that can
be reached within a short time frame. All other data
will be collected remotely. This means that only the
most basic data – size, general atmosphere type and
possibly hydrographics – will be known about most
bodies in the system.

There is more time available during an exploratory
advance but some bodies are sufficiently distant that
they cannot be visited without delaying the mission.
A common, but by no means universal, approach
is to jump to the likely mainworld of the system and
explore it for a day or two whilst sending craft to other
bodies. The parent ship will then transit to the gas giant
for refuelling and conduct exploration of any moons
or ring systems. If the mainworld merits additional
investigation, refuelling can be delayed by a day or
more. This approach means that there will be good
data on the mainworld and one gas giant, and less
detailed information on other bodies.

In most cases surface exploration will take the form
of scanning and radar mapping, possibly backed up
by probes. Sending personnel to land on a body is a
decision that must always be carefully weighed. The
time taken is a factor, along with wear on craft and
equipment and the risk to personnel. On the other
hand, getting out of the ship – even on an airless
rockball – is good for morale in the long term.

Data quality from any given body can vary. The size,
surface gravity, characteristics of orbit and of rotation
are considered the absolute basics – just enough to
say how much of a body is present and where it will be
at any given time. For a rockball moon this is entirely
sufficient under most circumstances. Additional data
includes hydrographics and atmospheric conditions.
Knowing these is sufficient to estimate the likelihood of
life and how advanced it can be. There are occasional
surprises, of course, but exploration is largely about
playing the percentages. Turning over every rock may
be desirable to those who do not have to spend time
doing it but for exploration crews the only viable option
is to go with likelihoods.

Where there is something interesting to be found, or it
seems likely, additional information is sought. This can
take the form of atmosphere and soil or rock samples,
deep mapping of tectonic plates and magnetic fields,

###### The Exploration Process

and study of the local ecosystem. The latter is a whole
new phase of exploration, beginning with the broadest
of brush strokes and closing in on the details. It is
possible to get a quick overview of an ecosystem in a
short time but detailed study can take weeks, months
or longer. It has been wisely said that ‘you do not know
a planet until you have lived – and almost died – there’.

In most cases this level of study is beyond the scope
of an initial exploration mission. If there is sufficient
interest a follow-up expedition may be sent, with
specialised equipment and personnel. This may have
to wait a long time, however. There is a lot of space
to cover and only so much in the budget. For this
reason there is one other absolutely critical piece of
information: how solid the data is. If there is a high
degree of confidence, an informed decision can
be made about whether to send a follow-up or not.
Low-confidence data is probably not worth further
exploration unless it is to be refined and confirmed
alongside other objectives. Of course, this process is
informed by a perception of value. A modest likelihood
of a completely new form of life may be worth an
expensive follow-up whereas a high-confidence
assessment of a rather dull species will probably not.
Wise explorers always assume they do not know
everything and that some or most of what they do know
is questionable at best.

CONTACT
When a new intelligent species is discovered, the
decision needs to be made as to whether or not
to make contact. Sometimes this is dictated by
circumstances; contact can be made by accident
and often times ships have to get on with their main
mission no matter how interesting the local people
may be. In the latter case it is generally better to leave
contact for a follow-up mission.

Damage to local cultures is always a factor when
considering whether or not to make contact. This is
for genuinely positive reasons most of the time; the
Solomani believe they are who they are because
they developed properly in their correct environment,
like fine wine maturing before being brought to the
table. To take that away from another people is
almost sacrilegious. There is also the consideration
of what can be learned from another culture. If their
development is derailed, much of what is learned is
polluted. There is still value in this; investigation into
the effects of offworld intervention is a viable field of
study, after all.

The choice, then, is between ignoring a culture,
observing it, studying it in detail, and/or contacting it.
Study usually requires a degree of contact, typically
with researchers living among the locals. There
is another option, favoured by some explorers –
exploitation. This sometimes becomes necessary,
such as when a ship needs resources and the only
way to get them is with local help. Exploitation
usually takes the form of rather one-sided dealings
as opposed to enslavement, although that has
happened from time–to–time. More commonly, the
locals get something out of the bargain but it is
something the explorers do not value all that much.
This does not mean a deal need be totally one-sided.
For example, if a decent supply of iron and minerals
can be obtained an exploration ship’s workshops can
usually churn out quality steel tools for a low-tech
culture. These are not a big deal to the explorers but
they might advance local technology by 1,000 years
and alter the culture completely.

The decision to contract or not can be simplified by
evidence that the locals know about interstellar travel
or have ventured into space themselves. Those who
already know people can voyage between the stars
are unlikely to be as traumatised by the arrival of
friendly aliens as those who think they are alone in the
universe and stars are magic lights in the sky. On the
other hand, explorers have encountered civilisations
which are better left uninformed about the possibilities
of interstellar travel. Once it is known to be possible,
there is a strong incentive to find out how to do it.
The Solomani recall what happened to the Vilani at
the hands of upstarts and are keen not to be on the
receiving end of that experience.

Overall, contact is a tricky subject for the Solomani. The
desire to let cultures develop naturally is strong but so
is the need to squash any potential threat long before
it becomes significant. How a contact is handled is of
great interest in post-mission debriefings – possibly
more so than any amount of scientific data or new
resources. SolSec is more than willing to provide
advisors and experts to an exploration mission to assist
in making good decisions. These operatives may have
other security-related duties but their commitment to
‘good’ contacts is genuine. Making friends out there is
ideal; creating a history of honourable interaction is a
close second. Avoiding contact with potential hazards
is better than creating resentment by exploiting or
needlessly harming an encountered culture. Failing
all of that, a well-made case can result in warships
making a long trek out to ensure a newly encountered
civilisation never becomes a threat.

###### The Exploration Process

TRAVELLER

FOLLOW-UP
The follow-up phase logically comes after the
mission has been completed. It is the nature of
exploration to find new people and places, and
these will need to be investigated in turn. The usual
process is to present data to be added to the existing
body of knowledge and plan new missions based
upon it. These can be the subject of adventures
which differ from the ‘new worlds’ style of play.
Travellers might be sent to help a newly contacted
civilisation that is under attack or suffering a terrible
disease, and spend months on this one project. They
might also be sent to take control of an installation
whose current crew are not performing satisfactorily

- or who have mysteriously vanished. Again, the

Travellers might spend months doing something that
is not directly connected with exploration but which
happens as a result of the exploration process.

Follow-up missions can be used by the Referee to
create a change of pace or focus, or as a reward
for the Travellers. If they do well on an exploration
mission they might be given the chance to oversee the
development of a base in the region or even a small
colony. Travellers might start out as exploration crew
and end the campaign as the directors of an enclave
right out on the edge of what is known. At this point
they will experience the frustrations of the planning
stage from the other end, as wilful exploration groups
demand equipment that is simply not available.

Follow-up can also take place within an expedition
under some circumstances. It is always a difficult
decision to deviate from the mission schedule but a
well-planned expedition includes some leeway for
investigation of points of interest found along the way.
This so-called ‘slack time’ can be eaten up by requests
for the expedition to add in additional goals, creating a
very tight time frame which can lead to problems later.
Defending the slack time allocation is one of the most
important roles of mission planners.

Under some circumstances it is acceptable to extend
a mission in order to follow up important discoveries
but crew and vessel efficiency will drop over time.
Expected return dates are also a factor. A year-long
expedition that comes home three months late is
unremarkable but when the same mission has not
been heard from for two years a rescue must be
considered. This can mean reallocating resources
from another project or cancelling it entirely, and even
if the ships and people are available needless long
transits are a drain. A crew that rushes through the
unknown for months to search for a lost expedition,
only to find its members dawdling around an
interesting cluster of worlds conducting ‘just one more’
interaction with the local cultures, will bring home a
rather negative report. Careers are ruined by this sort
of thing. However, search and rescue – usually with a
brief to finish the other crew’s mission if possible – is a
tragically common form of follow-up.

###### The Exploration Process

The Universal Research Mechanic (URM) can be
used to resolve all scientific and investigative efforts
in a campaign, other than those that require a specific
action or item. How much effort a given mystery
requires to solve is always up to the Referee, with the
information in this chapter as guidelines. The Travellers
should not be able to unravel the deepest secrets of
the universe with a single skill check; if they really want
to search for answers that have eluded scientists for
centuries then they are welcome to try but it will take
a great deal of time and effort with no guarantee of
success. Indeed, one set of answers might well lead
only to more questions.

The URM can serve as a generator for adventure
ideas. Rather than presenting all the answers after
a research session, the Referee may inform the
Travellers that they have discovered some good
leads on sources of relevant information. Following
up on those could lead to anything from plunging
into an unknown jungle in search of rumoured lost
cities to attempting to negotiate with a cranky old
university professor for access to a lifetime’s work
on obscure gravitational phenomena. Alternatively,
the research project may be a complete success but
trigger intervention by some outside agency, or reveal
sensitive historical data. The Travellers might, for
example, figure out the answer to their question but
discover that a previous research team went missing
just after submitting the same data for publication.

The key to the URM is the Breakthrough Index. This
indicates what level of information the Travellers have
managed to gain. This information will usually be correct
but if there are good reasons why false conclusions
might be drawn the Referee can impose penalties unless
the Travellers have taken measures to corroborate their
findings or trap errors. A band of Travellers can have
several Breakthrough Indexes on the go at once, each
connected with a different target. The greater the index
value the more the Travellers will know and the better
their chances of finding something useful.

**BACKGROUND INFORMATION**
Breakthrough Index (BI) might begin at zero for many
topics. Common sense must be applied, however. If
there is a great deal of relevant data readily available or

# T RESEARCH MECHANIC

## HE UNIVERSAL

already known due to a good education, the Travellers
may start out with much of the information they require.

For topics which are quite well known, Travellers gain
one point of BI per two full points of EDU the person
leading the investigation has themselves or can call
upon from someone they are in contact with. Such
topics might include the history of the Confederation
or the basics of any field the Traveller has at least
skill level 1 in. An additional DM equal to the highest
relevant skill level applies. For example, if the
Travellers are trying to figure out some obscure facet
of a world’s climate and one of them has Survival,
Navigation or a relevant Science skill at level 2 and an
EDU of 9, BI begins at 4 (for the EDU) plus 2 (for the
skill), giving a starting Breakthrough Index 6.

For more obscure topics or complex subjects, BI begins
at half this level. Obscure topics might include the history
of digital art, Imperial starship naming conventions or the
study of a disease the Travellers have just encountered.
For situations where the Travellers have no information
at all, such as the contents of an unmapped hex on the
star map, BI starts at 0.

UNIQUE INFORMATION
Sometimes the Travellers may have some piece
of unique information such as records of a missing
exploration mission dating all the way back to the Rule
of Man. Unique information will typically add up to +6 to
the Breakthrough Index for the target but will typically
be worth +3–4 points.

RESEARCH AND THEORETICAL WORK
Research and theoretical work can take many
forms ranging from listening for spacers’ rumours in
starport bars, a detailed scientific hypothesis, and/or
data-mining from old charts and records. Theoretical
work connected with a given subject generally takes
2D days to complete after information is gathered.
The Travellers may obtain information from various
sources, with each valid source requiring an Average
(8+) check to produce useful data. Only one set of
useful data can be obtained from any given source,
although multiple Travellers can try to obtain the
same type of information.

TRAVELLER

Find useful rumours, folk tales, friend-of-a-friend stories
and other vague but potentially useful information:
Average (8+) Carouse check (1D days, INT or SOC).

To look up all potentially relevant data from obscure
databases and sources including old records, missing
ship reports and historical accounts of events in the
region: Average (8+) Investigate or Admin check (1D
days, EDU).

To produce a scientific prediction of what might be at a
given location or predict where a known phenomenon
might occur: Average (8+) Science (relevant subject)
check (1D days, INT).

Other information sources can be added at the
Referee’s discretion.

Tying it all together requires a Very Difficult (12+)
Science or Investigate check, taking 2D days to
produce a theoretical analysis of the target. Each piece
of useful information is worth DM+2. The Effect of this
check is added to the Breakthrough Index.

REMOTE RECONNAISSANCE
Remote reconnaissance is typically associated with
planetary and astrographical phenomena. Data
is collected from a distance. Typically, this means
gravitic sensing and radio-telescopic surveys of a
sector map hex before entering it, or the collection of
data on a given planet by observing its albedo, orbital
and rotational periods, and by spectroscopic analysis
of atmospheric composition. Such observation is
almost certain to go undetected by a non-spacefaring
culture, although there is a limit to how much can be
determined in this manner.

A remote survey of a star system takes 2D days
for a suitably equipped vessel. A survey of a single
world takes 4D hours and produces more detail than
a system survey. Similar considerations apply to
other remote reconnaissance; mapping a continent
with drones and small craft overflights takes 2D
days whilst a survey of a city, conducted remotely,
takes 4D hours. Such a reconnaissance will produce
data on Tech Level, population size, level of
industrialisation and the sort of vehicles and power
generations systems are in use.

Rather than making a check to determine the presence
of any given object, an Electronics (sensors) check is
made by the surveying vessel or team and the level of
success indicates what can be detected. The survey

can be repeated multiple times. However, only one
result can be added to the Breakthrough Index. The
Travellers can thus spend months collecting data until
they have as much as they are going to get.

The Electronics (sensors) check is made at Average
(8+) difficulty, with DM-2 for standard starship or
scientific sensors, DM+0 for a good set of military or
exploration sensors and DM+2 for an extensive survey
or scientific suite. Twice the Effect of this check can be
added to the Breakthrough Index.

PRELIMINARY SURVEY/INVESTIGATION
A preliminary survey or investigation can only be
carried out at the target location. The subject can be
as large as a star system or as small as a single family
home. Obviously, the amount of time required for the
survey depends on how much space is to be covered.

Surveying a small in-system object such as a comet
from a starship takes 2D hours. A preliminary survey
of a planet-sized object takes 6D hours for a starship.
12D hours is required to survey a larger object such as
a gas giant or brown dwarf. The same general principle
applies to a groundside survey team: a single farm can
be surveyed in 2D hours, a small town in 6D hours and
a small city in 12D hours. Not everything will be known,
of course, but everything obvious and some of the
underlying details will be discovered.

A survey or preliminary investigation requires a Routine
(6+) Electronics (sensors) check. The Effect of this
check is added to the Breakthrough Index.

Surveying a whole star system takes much longer; at
least 3D days. The same Electronics (sensors) check
is made as above but there is no maximum value. A
system survey can detect rogue objects associated
with the system. In this context ‘system’ refers to an
entire sector map hex, so a deep-space hex can be
surveyed in this manner.

The survey can be repeated on the same time frame
for each attempt. Each survey after the first adds only
half the Effect of the check, rounded down. In some
special cases the Referee may rule that a given object
requires a higher score to detect, which may reward
persistence. Of course, there is no guarantee there is
anything present to be detected in the first place.

This describes exploration of a star system and its
planets but the same process can be applied to
scientific investigations, historical research or any
other form of knowledge-seeking. In this context,

The Universal Research Mechanic

an investigation means a significant effort to obtain
information by direct observation, interaction and
obtaining records or related data where possible.

**DETAILED SURVEY/INVESTIGATION**
A detailed survey includes mapping of at least major
surface features, collection of atmosphere, liquids
and biological samples, and some analysis work. A
detailed survey of a planet-sized body takes 3D days; a
planetoid belt takes three times as long whilst a smaller
body such as a single comet takes only 1D days. An
investigation of a particular topic takes a similar amount
of time for a proportionately sized team. In this case a
topic might be the history of an alien species – as it is
known – or research into an ecosystem, a particular
disease, or a physical on-planet phenomenon.

Once the survey or investigation is completed, an
Easy (4+) Science or Investigate check is made. If
successful, the Breakthrough Index for that subject
jumps to 10. This does not mean that everything is
known, nor that all data is 100% accurate, but the
Travellers will now be in possession of reasonably
reliable information about their target.

**RESEARCH**
When conducting research, the Traveller leading the
effort may make a skill check once per day based on
the type of investigation being carried out. Each person
assisting them provides DM+1, providing they have
some relevant skill, normally Investigate, Science or
Electronics, but a case could be made for Steward if
the team isquite large. The maximum benefit that can
be obtained from assistance is DM+2 plus the highest
Leadership or Admin skill in the project.

Focused Expedition or Investigation
A focused expedition or investigation does not add to the
target’s Breakthrough Index, at least not as its primary
goal. A focused expedition is intended to obtain specific
information such as the presence of resources or
what it is like to live on a given planet. At the Referee’s
discretion this may fill in the blanks of earlier surveys
and bring the BI up to 10 but, for the most part, a
focused expedition should be the subject of one or more
adventures rather than a single skill check.

BREAKTHROUGH INDEX
The Breakthrough Index (see table page 20) indicates
how much is known about the subject. This data is not
necessarily correct but errors will be within the bounds
of possibility. For example, if the presence of a main

sequence star is indicated by the Breakthrough Index
then one will be there but it may not be of the expected
type. A predicted yellow main sequence star might turn
out to be an orange subgiant but it is very unlikely that
a black hole will be present instead.

Note that ‘rogue’ bodies (those with wildly eccentric
orbits or which are located in deep space between star
systems, in empty sector hexes) require a very high
Breakthrough Index to detect at all. Once known, they
can be visited and directly surveyed. Similarly, some
historical facts are suppressed, distorted or forgotten,
and any subject can have errors in the known data. In
some cases the Travellers may achieve BI 12 and think
they know everything, only to find there was more to be
learned if only they knew where to look.

The Breakthrough Index can be used by the Referee
as an indicator of what is known about a distant star
system. For example, it may be that the only publicly
available data on a given star system corresponds to a
Breakthrough Index of 4 – presence and type of stars.
This would suggest that there is no information in the
public databases about the people of the system, if any,
or even if there are any planets there.

A rigorous theoretical analysis with several avenues of
data collection will typically yield a Breakthrough Index
of 2–4. Thoroughly conducted distant surveying by a
properly equipped scientific or exploration ship, or good
work by a ground team or research project, will produce
a Breakthrough Index of 4–6. Combining these two
average values, it can be assumed that a Breakthrough
Index of around 7–9 is available for star systems close
to major trade routes and inhabited worlds, even if
the target system has not been much visited, and that
a reasonable amount will be known about anyone
living there. Full data (Breakthrough Index 10) will
be available on systems that are routinely visited by
starships, although the presence of rogue bodies may
not be known. For more distant systems, only the most
basic data may be available in public systems, if at
all. If commercial starships do not go somewhere, it is
unlikely that there will be much information about it.

rarely go or where local powers are not sufficiently
respectful of the Confederation’s prestige. This is
a useful definition, vague as it is, as it refers to the
potential hazards to navigation encountered by
Travellers and their ships.

Other than political differences, the region close to the
Confederation border is not very different to that within
it. Many worlds were colonised by humans during the
Interstellar Wars era and the Rule of Man, and have
interacted with the Solomani since long before the
Confederation existed. In this region it is possible to
obtain detailed information on a nearby star system
by accessing the local datanets. This is not, by any
stretch of the imagination, the Rimward Wilderness
some vid shows portray it as. Hazards exist but this is
the fringe of Charted Space rather than an area where
the map has to be filled in as a mission progresses.

At some point that changes. Exactly where depends
on local astrography, politics and the vagaries of fate.
Where a colony mission pushed out a long way and
made a successful landing on a habitable world, now
a small region of civilised space exists. In between
are less settled regions, where piracy is a potential
problem. For piracy to be profitable there has to be
both enough traffic to make money from and a lack
of effective countermeasures. Passing through these
regions presents hazards that do not exist elsewhere
and to many the Rimward Region begins where there
is no longer a threat from pirates and similar problems
associated with politics and a desire to make money
by any means necessary.

Once clear of the fringe, conditions appear to be
much the same all the way to the edge of the spiral
arm. Stellar density varies and the incidence of
inhabited worlds drops steadily with distance from
Confederation space. During the Interstellar Wars
there was a real fear that Terra would be captured
or bombarded into oblivion, leading to the launch of
a great many sublight colonial missions. These, for
the most part, proceeded away from the Vilani threat
and eventually settled many worlds in a rimward
direction. The peak of the sublight exodus was
unofficially named ‘The Great Runaway’ by historians.
Deliberately or otherwise, many of these missions left
behind no records of where they were headed.

Later, during the Rule of Man, there was a second
wave of colonial expansion. The vast majority of
these missions used jump-capable ships and set up
their colonies long before the sublight ships arrived.
Few of these jump-capable pocket empires survived
for long, although there have been some notable
exceptions. The result was a seeding of humans and
[[Terra|Terran]] species on a great many worlds out towards
the rim. Today, most of these populations are at a
low to mid-Tech Level and some have completely
forgotten their heritage.

Starfaring aliens are also rare. A few species have built
sublight starships and colonised other worlds but the
majority of intelligent aliens are confined to a single
star system. There are no known Major Races towards
the rim and the Ancients were not active there. Here
and there a civilisation may be encountered which has
managed to reverse-engineer a drive from a [[Terra|Terran]],
Aslan or Hiver vessel but for the most part explorers
will not meet other jump-capable peoples.

The area of space between the Solomani
Confederation and the rimward edge of the spiral
arm is vast and known to contain a number of
anomalies and unusual phenomena. The region has
not been explored in any detail, other than where
necessary to drive a transit corridor through, and as
a result it can be a dangerous place. It may be that
missions have been passing close to the territory of
some fascinating or lethal alien civilisation without
being aware of it, or that fabulous wealth lies waiting
for those who turn off the Rimward Corridor at just
the right point. It may even be that this wealth has
been discovered and that the publicly available data
has been altered to conceal it.

In short, Travellers who venture into the Rimward
Region should tread carefully. They are quite literally
off the map, with little prospect of rescue if something
goes awry. Yet there are opportunities to be had out
there in the wilderness. Direct profit from amazing
finds is always a prospect but there are also careers
to be made and legends to be created. None of which
matters to Travellers who do not return. This is a reality
for those who venture rimward; they must also be
mindful of the way back home.

The Universal Research Mechanic

The standard starship operation rules (see the Traveller
Core Rulebook, page 149) discuss maintenance of
space craft under normal operating circumstances.
Routine maintenance is assumed to be carried out on
a constant basis, with an annual overhaul. Skimping
on maintenance or ignoring it completely imposes an
8+ (on 2D) chance of a malfunction each week, with
a 25% chance of this being a jump drive breakdown.
However, this applies to the typical small merchant
vessel operating in known space.

Military ships and exploration vessels may have to
operate away from dockyards for an extended period
and cannot afford to suffer breakdowns due to low
maintenance levels. Fortunately, such vessels are
designed to be relatively easy to maintain – or rather,
successful designs are. The navy has been saddled
with some ‘dockyard nightmares’ over the years but
generally irons out the faults or finds a workaround.
It is reasonable to assume that a properly designed
military ship makes provision for maintenance and
damage control whereas a civilian ship is optimised for
efficiency in a commercial role.

In addition, naval and exploration crews are trained
in efficient shipboard maintenance and improvised
field repairs. A combination of being able to get at
components and the ability to send teams outside the
ship to carry out tasks normally requiring a dockyard
greatly improves the maintenance situation. Therefore,
a ship with a properly trained military or exploration crew
can carry out routine maintenance for an effectively
indefinite period. The period between requirements for a
dockyard visit is doubled if the ship has either a well-
trained military crew (or the equivalent) or is designed
for easy maintenance, and tripled if both apply. The
Referee should determine which of these conditions
does or does not apply – not all naval designs get it right
and not all crews are fully efficient.

If the crew are skilled enough, the equivalent of a proper
dockyard overhaul can be carried out in space or on
the surface of a planet, although with great difficulty.
This is not in any way a routine operation and should be
presented as an adventure each time a vessel attempts
self-overhaul. Casualties may occur and creative
solutions will be required on many occasions. As a rule
of thumb, an exploration vessel that is not going to make
port within the next 3–4 years will halt every 24–30
months for a self-overhaul. This is likely to take 3–4

weeks even if supplies and spares are available, and
could be longer if complications arise.

Other than crew endurance, the greatest limitation on
mission duration is the jump drive. One option is for a
ship to carry more than one drive but this takes up a lot
of space that might be better used for something else.
The alternative is to extend the time to failure of a ship’s
drive. Commercial starships are required to undertake
an annual maintenance, including overhaul of the jump
drive. This can create an impression that the system will
break down if maintenance is neglected for a few weeks
or months. That is not quite the case.

The typical merchant crew uses their jump drive to
get where they are going and has it serviced once a
year at a dockyard. A hard-working ship might make
three jumps in a month, or around 35 in a year. This
is acceptably safe even if the ship’s maintenance
schedule is rather lax. Even after this safe margin is
passed, drives do not immediately break down. In
theory, a jump drive could go on forever, if the users are
very lucky, but the likelihood of misjump or catastrophe
increases steadily once the safety margin is passed.

It can be assumed that an exploration crew constantly
monitors and maintains their drive, swapping in
spare components at the slightest hint of potential
trouble. Shipboard workshops permit components
to be fabricated or brought back into top condition.
Malfunctions and misjumps do happen, of course, but a
properly trained and equipped exploration crew should
be able to operate their drive for three to five times
as long as a merchant ship with the same margins for
safety. This is entirely sufficient to permit exploration
operations in a large volume of space surrounding a
forward base, or to transit between such bases.

It can therefore be assumed that, assuming careful
maintenance is being undertaken, a jump drive will
give 100–150 jumps without serious trouble. This is
sufficient to get from the border of the Confederation to
the Lubbock Enclave, which was a factor in choosing to
set up an enclave there. For longer exploration missions
a drive overhaul is necessary and will probably be done
when the ship stops for its self-maintenance operation.
Even so, without a proper dockyard there is always
a chance of sudden drive failure or the development
of a cascading fault. For every 50 jumps past the last
successful overhaul, DM-1 applies to all jump attempts.

# L STARSHIP OPERATIONS

## ONG-DURATION

The standard star system creation system presented
in the Traveller Core Rulebook is well suited to
creating settled areas in which a population is likely
to be present on most planets. This is not the case
out on the rim. The Referee may have to generate
large numbers of star systems, depending on where
the Travellers decide to go, but in most cases it is
not necessary to run through the full system creation
process. Instead, the following quick system can be
used. The Referee need only use as many stages
as necessary; if the Travellers decide to bypass a
system because it does not look interesting there is
no need for details.

STAGE 1:^

DETERMINE STELLAR BODIES
The probability of a star system depends upon stellar
density in a region. This can vary within a sector or
even a subsector.

Star System Presence
Region Type Presence of Star System
Cluster 1–5 on 1D
Dense 1–4 on 1D
Average 1–3 on 1D
Sparse 1–2 on 1D
Rift 2 on 2D
Void 3 on 3D

The majority of stellar bodies encountered will
be main sequence stars of a sort that might have
planets. For quickness, the Referee can assume
a system has an ‘ordinary’ star of this type without
determining its exact type. Subgiant, giant and
supergiant stars, as well as other stellar objects
such as pulsars or black holes, should be placed
deliberately and are likely to be detected at very
great distances. Their presence will almost certainly
be known to the expedition planners and they will
serve as useful points of reference for navigation.

# S GENERATION

## TAR SYSTEM

The standard system creation process focuses on
populations and adventure settings, so does not
make provision for ‘empty’ star systems that have
nothing but one or more stars and a few comets.
There is some debate as to whether the maps of
Charted Space omit these systems as they cannot
provide fuel without great difficulty and will not
have anyone living there. If the Referee follows this
system there may be more stars than star systems
but they may not be of much interest.

If, on the other hand, the Referee decides that the
presence of a star on the map does not necessarily
indicate the existence of a planetary system, life
becomes more difficult for explorers. An empty system
will have a few comets and planetoids which can
be used as a source of ice, and therefore fuel, but
this is a slow way to supply a mission. A region with
many empty systems could be an effective barrier to
navigation, perhaps resulting in an isolated region with
its own characteristics.

BROWN DWARFS AND UNUSUAL STARS
A brown dwarf might be referred to as a ‘sub-stellar
object’. It has some of the characteristics of a star
and some of a gas giant. Brown dwarfs are created
by the accretion of insufficient matter to begin
stellar fusion but sufficient to create a gravity well
far greater than that of any planetary body. Brown
dwarfs are hard to detect due to their lower energy
output compared to stars but may be able to warm
their moons sufficiently for life to exist there. This
means the Referee can add a brown dwarf to a star
system – perhaps as a distant companion – without
altering the map, or can insert a ‘rogue brown dwarf
system’ in an otherwise empty hex.

Most other unusual star types are formed as
normal but have undergone some form of change.
In the case of subgiants, the process is currently
underway. The star has ceased to fuse hydrogen in
its core, leading to changing conditions that result
in an increase in size. A subgiant will continue to
expand over millions of years, finally reaching the
giant stage. During this period it will destroy most of

TRAVELLER

the planetary bodies it once had. Conditions in the
system will be in a state of flux, with inner planets
already destroyed and others in danger.

The atmospheres of gas giants may be stripped away
during the subgiant and giant phases, perhaps leaving
a rocky core, and previously ‘cold’ worlds may be
warmed enough to support life. There is insufficient
time for anything to evolve beyond a bundle of cells,
however, but life of some sort might thrive for a time if
imported by starfarers. Such a system might be highly
interesting to explorers, although perhaps hazardous
to visit. Once the star begins to collapse, the situation
becomes even more dangerous. Radiation flares, mass
ejections and even nova events are all possible in such
a system and there is also the potential for bodies to be
perturbed out of their orbits.

For low and intermediate mass stars, expansion into
a relatively cool giant star – typically a red giant – is
followed by collapse into a dense remnant known as
a white dwarf. The outer layers of matter are typically
ejected to create a nebula, although this may not be
very impressive. What remains is a very hot and dense
body which gradually cools over many millions of years.
A typical example might have around half a solar mass
(about half the mass of Earth’s sun) packed into a
space little larger than a typical terrestrial planet. Such
a body may retain some bodies in what was formerly its
outsystem. Anything closer will have been destroyed in
the subgiant and giant phases, although it is possible
some bodies may have been perturbed and fallen into
a closer orbit as conditions stabilised.

Bigger and brighter stars – bright giants and
supergiants – are very rare. They are extremely bright
and can serve as navigational reference points for
ships hundreds of parsecs away. These stars burn
through their fuel quickly and usually meet a violent end
as a supernova. The process takes millions of years but
the end can be catastrophic for life in the local region
as radiation from the dying star washes over them.
Gigantic stars of this sort are unlikely to have useable
planets but there is always a chance they might have
captured a rogue or possess a few bodies surviving
from their far outsystem.

Former supergiant stars may retain enough mass to
collapse into extremely dense bodies. What is not
ejected in a supernova event collapses into a very
small space creating a neutron star or a black hole. It
is possible for a star system to contain multiple bodies
including ordinary stars, supergiant stars and gas

giants, plus one or more black holes. Such a system
represents a huge accretion of matter and is likely to be
engaged in vigorous interactions. For example, a black
hole might be stripping matter from a nearby supergiant
star, resulting in enormous emissions and a great deal
of radiation and making this a dangerous place to visit
even if no ships approach the black hole.

At the other end of the scale, protostars are gas
clouds in the process of accreting into a star and
possibly a planetary system, and T-Tauri stars are
close to completing the process. Both represent
a challenge to navigation due to the difficulties of
operating a jump drive in a dispersed gas cloud.
There may not be sufficient gravitational force at any
given point to prevent a jump but interference is likely
making misjump a risk.

STAGE 2:^

DETERMINE THE PRESENCE^

OF GAS GIANTS
Gas giants are easier to detect than terrestrial (rocky)
planets. The presence of one or more means that
fuel can be skimmed, which will be of great interest to
explorers. At least one gas giant suitable for refuelling
operations will be present on 9+ when rolling 2D. There
may or may not be something unusual about these
giants, at the Referee’s discretion.

A star system could have gas giants but no terrestrial
planets. If so, a moon of one of the gas giants may
be the system’s mainworld candidate, or in some rare
cases there may be none. Life is possible on a gas

MAPS
The star maps in this book conform to the
‘planetary system’ model, so almost without
exception if a star is indicated it has some kind
of planetary system. The Referee can add
empty systems, deep space brown dwarfs and
unusual stars wherever they seem desirable,
however they should bear in mind that the
events surrounding the creation of a black hole
or neutron star involve a supernova that would
wipe out all life for several parsecs.

###### Star system Generation

giant moon but it is unlikely to be very advanced. If a
population exists in such a system it will have come
from elsewhere, suggesting some form of spacefaring
culture in the region.

A gas giant has a very significant gravity well. This
usually results in the presence of multiple moons of
various sizes and possibly a ring system composed
of smaller fragments. Planetoids may collect at
the giant’s Trojan points – 60 degrees ahead and
behind it in its orbit. The giant planet may or may not
have a solid core but will have a central region in
a liquid state as a result of the immense pressures
encountered there. Higher up in the atmosphere,
which is composed mainly of hydrogen compounds,
pressure eventually drops to the point where human-
crewed space vessels can survive. Expeditions have
occasionally been mounted into the depths of a gas
giant’s atmosphere but operating any deeper than the
upper layers is extremely dangerous.

The majority of gas giants are defined as ‘small’ or
'large’; very general terms covering a wide range of
masses. A large gas giant might be the equivalent of
Jupiter or Saturn in the Sol system; a small Jovian
is likely to be around the size of Neptune or Uranus.
Extremely large ‘superjovians’ are possible and would

be a point of interest for any exploration mission. The
difference in mass between even a superjovian and a
brown dwarf is enormous – the former are oversized
planetary bodies and the latter puny failed stars.

STAGE 3:

GENERATE MAINWORLD
There is no guarantee that any given system will have
a mainworld-candidate, as noted before. If there is
one, it will be the most potentially habitable body in
the system. Its characteristics can be determined as
normal, with the exception that Population and all social
characteristics will almost certainly be 0. Minor Races,
lost colonies or other populations should always be
placed by the Referee. Intelligent life will be rare, to say
the least, and spacefaring cultures even more so.

The mainworld may or may not be in the ‘warm zone’
of the system, where liquid water can exist. A world
that has a breathable atmosphere almost certainly
will be but rockballs and exotic atmosphere planets
could be closer in to the star or further out. Advanced
life is staggeringly unlikely to exist on such bodies
unless it arrived from elsewhere and has some
artificial means of support.

###### Star system Generation

TRAVELLER

If there is a life-bearing world or candidate for one in
the system, this will be a point of interest for explorers.
It may be that a body in the system has an exotic
atmosphere type that can support life. If so, this
might be considered the mainworld even if it is not
located where a human-occupied mainworld would be
expected. The system’s profile will refer to this body,
in the sense of ‘most important world’ as opposed to
‘most habitable for humans’.

Planetoid belts are not uncommon in a star system
but for one to be considered the mainworld of a newly
discovered system is unusual. A belt that has significant
resources in a system with no world that is even
borderline habitable would qualify, or one that occupies
the closest orbit to the optimal point for liquid water. In
this case the ‘asteroid belt’ designation indicates there
is no prospect for a conventional life-bearing planet,
although there is always the possibility of an unusual
form of life existing somewhere in the system.

STAGE 4:

GENERATE OTHER BODIES
If the Travellers decide to explore a system in detail it
may be necessary to generate the other bodies. This
is only likely if something has piqued their interest –
there are a great many star systems to explore, so
a broad brush approach is necessary most of the
time. For quick system generation, assume there are
2D bodies plus the mainworld and that 1D of these
bodies are gas giants. The standard 2D-2 method
of determining Size indicates whether these are

planetoids, small planets or larger terrestrials. Any
unusual bodies, such as giant super-earths, should be
placed by the Referee. They are likely to be points of
interest for the Travellers and can break up a series of
‘just another rockball’ explorations.

Note that just because a body is present does not
mean the Travellers will know about it or have all the
information on it. The presence of a star will be obvious
to any ship with working sensors but if the Travellers
want to know more about a system they will have to do
some work. This can be modelled using the Universal
Research Mechanic or played out as an adventure.

MORE DETAIL?
This quick system generation method generates
bodies and features in the order they are likely
to be detected – stars, then large bodies like gas
giants, then smaller ones, and so forth. This is
useful when quickly plotting a region of space
the Travellers may explore in the most cursory
manner. Referees desiring more detail may wish
to use or adapt the rules presented in the Great
Rift and Deepnight Revelation box sets. Rimward
exploration is little different to adventuring in the
Great Rift, other than an increased density of
stars and the likelihood of encountering entirely
new intelligent species.

###### Star system Generation

The two most likely settings for Travellers going
‘planetside’ are potentially life-bearing mainworlds and
artificial environments. Expeditions might be launched
to the surface of Just Another Rockball Number
2202201, especially if some resource is thought likely
to exist there, but for the most part it is potentially
habitable or life-bearing worlds that interest explorers
the most. Any sort of artificial structure is naturally of
interest, whether it is a forward base with other humans
present, an alien city or a strange ruin that just might be
a wrecked starship.

Most of the worlds explorers land on can be generated
using the standard Traveller rules. This gives a good
chance of a breathable atmosphere, perhaps with
taints or requiring the use of a compressor. Even a
‘shirtsleeves environment’ is not without hazards –
adverse weather conditions, rock slides, unexpectedly
hazardous terrain, and the like. If there is life, that
too can be a serious hazard. In many cases, the
environment is the only hazard the Travellers will face.
More exotic environments can be directly or indirectly
hazardous and may pose unique threats.

As a general rule, worlds with a dense atmosphere
are more subject to erosion than those with thinner air.
Flight is also affected; flying creatures are much less
likely on thin-atmosphere worlds and are restricted
to lower altitudes. This also applies to non-grav flying
vehicles; wings cannot generate as much lift without
thick air, restricting heavier-than-air craft or making
them entirely useless. The Referee can play around
with the effects of air pressure to create an unusual
world. Perhaps flying creatures exist in a chain of
deep canyons but cannot fly high enough to reach
the main surface, or pressure/temperature layers
might trap a dangerous atmospheric taint in a band
that allows normal life above and below it in two
completely separate ecosystems.

In general, life will be abundant on worlds with dense or
standard atmospheres and perhaps somewhat less so
on thin-atmosphere worlds. An atmosphere containing
oxygen will almost always indicate an ecosystem, as
the presence of free oxygen in significant quantities is
a result of life processes. It is possible that some other
process might be responsible but if real-world science
is to be followed this is perhaps unlikely. However,

this does not mean that every oxygen-atmosphere
world is like Earth. Some may be in a very early state
of development, with only the most primitive of life. In
other cases a world might be dying, with little left of its
once rampant ecosystem. Climate change is another
possibility; a world might be coming out of an ice age
or descending into one, or drying out due to increased
temperature. Each world the Travellers visit has a story
which can be unravelled by observation and analysis.

A tainted atmosphere has something about it that
makes it hazardous for humans to breathe unaided.
Exactly what that is will determine the characteristics of
the world. The Referee can play a little fast and loose
with the concept, perhaps deciding that the ‘taint’ is too
little or too much oxygen. Too little suggests a young
world with primitive life in the seas but none on land,
slowly changing its atmospheric composition to the
point where advanced life is possible. Too much oxygen
can be fatal for humans and poses a severe fire hazard
but might make very large or highly efficient creatures
possible due to easy respiration.

Most taints will be a physical substance – pollen,
spores, dust and the like. A mild taint might not affect
the development of life all that much but something
like radioactive volcanic dust certainly will. A powerful
enough atmospheric taint might turn what appears to
be a garden world into an ecological hell. The presence
of a particular taint will usually have implications for
conditions worldwide – sufficient volcanic dust to
constitute a taint implies a great deal of volcanism,
for example. This might result in ‘volcanic winter’
conditions by blocking sunlight. If this is a permanent
situation the local life, if any, will be adapted to it. If not,
species will be dying out and the overall ecosphere will
be in a state of change.

ROCKBALL ENVIRONMENTS
The term ‘rockball’ is typically applied to airless
worlds of any size, including planetoids. It is generally
stretched to include trace and very thin atmospheres
if there is little or no hydrographics and no life. The
hazards of such worlds are familiar to spacefarers;
lack of pressure means a full vacc suit or pressure
suit is required along with temperature control and
perhaps radiation protection. Micrometeorites are

# P LANETARY ENVIRONMENTS

TRAVELLER

another hazard, along with loose or jagged rocks that
can trip a Traveller or lacerate a suit. Dust pools can
trap an unwary explorer or their vehicle whilst unstable
surfaces may endanger a landing spacecraft.

One rockball is not necessarily like another. Small
planetoids have so little gravity an unwary Traveller
could fall off and end up floating helplessly away. Larger
bodies are highly volcanic or seismically unstable; others
have water locked in deeply buried ice. There are no
likely plant or animal-related threats on such a world,
although extremophile life is a possibility. Anything
artificial must have been brought by starfarers. The
Referee should consider the effects of temperature in
such an environment. A rockball in the inner system may
receive too much energy during its ‘day’ and too little
at ‘night’, causing extreme variations in temperature,
perhaps accompanied by frozen gases subliming
straight to vapour. Impressive from a distance, this
phenomenon is highly dangerous close up, as the
expansion into gas can have the force of an explosion.

Inner system rockballs will lose any surface water
this way, although deposits may be found in sheltered
areas such as canyons and craters or deep under
the surface. Outsystem rockballs may never receive
sufficient heating to melt or sublime these gases, until
an unwary Traveller drops something hot or shoots
a laser drill into an ice field. Even just walking on the
surface of a frozen gas field can be hazardous. The
little heat that escapes through the soles of insulated
boots may be enough to melt the surface, shrouding
the Traveller in a cloud of gas as they sink into a
liquifying but still cryogenically cold semi-fluid. Worlds
with Atmosphere 0 are rockballs. Atmospheres 1–3 may
also indicate a rockball-type world if Hydrographics is
very low – 0 to 1, for example.

ICEBALL ENVIRONMENTS
By convention an outsystem world with more than a
trace of atmosphere is often referred to as an ‘iceball’
rather than a ‘rockball’. The distinction is sometimes
a little vague but can be useful. The atmosphere
of an iceball world will never be breathable and is
unlikely to support any but the most primitive of life.
The presence of an atmosphere of some sort provides
protection from micrometeorites, at least to some
extent but the atmosphere itself may be hazardous.
Worlds with Atmospheres 2–3 will usually be iceballs
if they are in the outsystem and some Atmosphere 1
worlds may also qualify. The indicator in this case is
Hydrographics greater than 1.

Iceball worlds present some challenges of their own. The
atmosphere could be of an actively dangerous type and
even if it is not, the interface between an installation and
the outside will be more complex. On a rockball, all that
is necessary is to seal buildings and vehicles to ensure
safety; an iceball requires flushing airlocks of potentially
toxic gases and possibly decontamination of suits and
equipment that have been outside.

HIGH GRAVITY ENVIRONMENTS
Some planets are unusually dense, creating a higher
gravity environment than would normally be expected.
This is unlikely to be extreme, however. Gravity
conditions much over 1.2G are very rare on terrestrial
planets, although it is possible that higher surface
gravity may be encountered on a dense super-earth.
These are rocky planets which are much larger than
usual, perhaps over 25,000 km in diameter.

Surface gravity on a solid super-earth is likely to
be in the 1.5–1.8 g range, with an extremely dense
atmosphere which is unlikely to be of a breathable
composition. Life is not impossible but advanced land
animals would have to take an extremely exotic form
which could contend with both the gravity and pressure
conditions. Water pressure would also increase more
quickly with depth than on a standard planet, creating
extreme conditions at quite shallow depths.

AQUATIC AND

FLUID ENVIRONMENTS
An aquatic environment assumes liquid water but does
not necessarily have to be paired with a breathable
atmosphere. Primitive life in the oceans may produce
oxygen and change the atmospheric composition over
time but early in the process, or on worlds where life
has not developed, there will be little free oxygen.
Operating on a fully water-covered world presents
serious problems for starfarers but complete coverage
is rare. If there is no usable land, thick ice floes can be
used as a landing area for smaller ships and craft.

Aquatic worlds may be subject to extremes of
temperature. One that receives a lot of solar energy will
become a steam bath, with highly energetic weather
systems and violent storms. Colder aquatic worlds
might be covered in a layer of ice, perhaps all the way
down to the seabed except where geothermal vents
provide some warming. Geothermal energy can drive a
local ecosystem on an otherwise barren world or create

###### Planetary Environments

‘islands’ where unique forms of life exist. These areas
may contain creatures very different from those on the
rest of the planet.

Similar comments apply to worlds with non-water
fluids, although the chemical composition of these
may have implications for explorers. High pressure
can permit exotic compounds to exist, which
sometimes translates to violent reactions when heat or
other forms of energy are applied. A fluid ocean prone
to explosions when struck by lightning or warmed by
a geothermal vent makes for an extremely hostile
environment in which to operate. Life could exist in
non-water oceans and would be sufficiently different to
the norm to merit an expedition.

EXOTIC ATMOSPHERE ENVIRONMENTS
The term ‘exotic’ covers a range of atmosphere types,
most of which might not seem particularly strange.
The context is ‘unusual for a place where people
would settle’, with the term used as a catch-all for any
atmosphere with a gas mix incapable of supporting
human respiration. Some exotic atmospheres are
essentially harmless whilst others are actively
damaging to unprotected personnel.

Exotic atmospheres can vary in terms of pressure
and temperature as much as breathable ones. This
can create conditions suitable for very unusual forms
of life to evolve, although some gas combinations
are incapable of supporting any known life process.
Anything that does exist in such an environment
would be classed as an extremophile and worthy of
study. This is one reason explorers are drawn to truly
horrible hell-worlds – they are so far from the norm that
something truly unusual may exist there.

**CARBON DIOXIDE**
Perhaps the commonest, and usually the least
hostile, of the exotic types is the carbon dioxide or
CO 2 atmosphere. It is largely composed of carbon
dioxide but may have a large amount of nitrogen
present as well as other gases. Such a world will
almost certainly not have advanced life, although
primitive photosynthesising micro-organisms are
possible. These convert carbon dioxide into oxygen
as a by-product of their life processes, gradually
changing the atmospheric composition.

If advanced life were to develop on such a world it would
be truly alien, drawing energy from sunlight or from
thermal, radioactive, chemical or even more unusual
sources. ‘Advanced’ in this context means there are
living things recognisable as some sort of plant, animal

or similar. Sentience is even more unlikely. However, this
does not rule out the possibility of neural chains made up
of billions of strange micro-organisms and other highly
exotic forms of life. How such a creature would view the
cosmos is difficult to say.

A carbon dioxide atmosphere world will probably have
fairly low pressure, equivalent to very thin or thin, with
a low hydrographic percentage. The hydrographic
percentage of such a world would probably also
be rather low, typically in the region of 30% or less.
Worlds with a thicker atmosphere might be subject to a
runaway greenhouse effect which could turn the planet
into a Venus-like hellhole.

NITROGEN
Nitrogen is an inert gas incapable of supporting
respiration or any similar function. As a result, nitrogen
atmosphere worlds are incapable of developing
life. At the same time, nitrogen is not harmful under
normal circumstances so, providing pressure levels
are acceptable, a Traveller needs only an air supply
to function. Nitrogen atmosphere worlds are usually
barren and rocky, since a lack of living things means no
soil deposition. A jagged landscape of crags, carved by
dusty winds, is likely.

A nitrogen atmosphere will have at least some quantity
of other gases mixed in and at some point needs to be
redesignated. Earth’s atmosphere is about 78% nitrogen
but it does not qualify as a nitrogen atmosphere. Since
the gas is inert, a lower percentage of other gases will
change the overall characteristics of the atmosphere.
Earth has 21% oxygen or so, creating an oxygen-nitrogen
atmosphere capable of supporting life. This rough gas mix
qualifies as the standard against which other atmospheric
types are measured and does not normally require a
designation. Thus ‘thin’ can be taken as shorthand for
‘thin oxygen-nitrogen, breathable’ where a thin nitrogen
atmosphere would be designated as such. Other gas
mixes are less benign. If oxygen is present but not in
sufficient proportions to create breathable atmosphere,
nitric acid can form under certain conditions. This can
create an irritant or corrosive atmosphere.

METHANE
Methane is not in and of itself harmful but it cannot
support normal respiration. It is also potentially
dangerous if oxygen is present due to the risk of
explosion. It is highly unlikely that free oxygen will be
found in an atmosphere containing a high percentage of
methane but there is a danger that Travellers visiting a
methane world could themselves create the conditions
for an explosion. Airlocks which fail to cycle properly or
small leaks in ships, habitats or space suits, could lead

###### Planetary Environments

TRAVELLER

to a concentration of methane; electrical equipment or
static electricity could cause a spark which will lead to a
potentially devastating explosion and fire.

Methane generally occurs as an active part of an
atmosphere on large, cold worlds. On smaller,
warmer planets the hydrogen which makes up part
of the gas is usually lost early in the planet’s history.
Thus, most worlds with methane in the atmosphere
will tend to be larger (Size 8+) and colder than what
would generally be considered ‘habitable’. A dense
or very dense exotic atmosphere is most likely to
consist of, or contain, methane.

Methane is a candidate for an alternative to oxygen in
supporting respiration or its equivalent. It is possible
that a methane-based ecosystem could develop and
that it might produce advanced and even sentient life.
Given the high pressure and low temperature of most
methane atmospheres, people who developed there
would require more than just breathing gear in order
to interact with humans. Competition for living space
would be unlikely, so providing conflict over resources
was not an issue, the two species could co-exist or
simply ignore one another.

AMMONIA
Ammonia atmospheres sit astride the border
between exotic and corrosive. Although not much
of a threat to equipment and vehicles in low
concentrations, ammonia is an irritant which affects
eyes and mucous membranes. One point of damage
is inflicted for every minute a Traveller is exposed
to a low concentration of ammonia. Atmospheres
containing a great deal of ammonia would be
corrosive rather than exotic and cause damage to
exposed skin. Ammonia atmosphere worlds are
typically similar to those with methane atmospheres

- large and cold with standard to high pressure.

CHLORINE
At room temperature chlorine is a greenish-yellow
gas. It is highly toxic to humans, although in small
concentrations is unpleasant rather than fatal.
Protection requires a fully sealed gas-proof suit,
although this does not have to a vacc suit – HAZMAT
clothing or a suit designed to protect against chemical
agents will suffice. Without such protection, a Traveller
exposed to chlorine in any significant concentration will
suffer one point of damage every 30 seconds.

Chlorine has been suggested as a likely alternative
to oxygen as a life-supporting gas as it reacts
similarly to oxygen in various chemical processes.

A planet with chlorine in its atmosphere would be a
mysterious and eerie environment, with a shifting
yellow-green haze causing the landscape to waver
in a murky green half-light, hiding and distorting
objects and shapes. Life forms evolving under such
conditions would be quite alien in appearance and
creatures might be expected to be more active and
energetic than their terrestrial counterparts due to
the superior reactive properties of chlorine.

SULPHUR COMPOUND
A variety of sulphur compounds can be found in
various types of atmospheres, ranging from non-
irritant up to corrosive in nature. These compounds
can be found in the atmospheres of otherwise
Earth-like worlds and indeed are one of the prime
components of smog. Thus in lower concentrations
sulphur compounds might be considered a taint rather
than defining the atmosphere type. The distinction
is usually made at the point where the presence of
sulphur is sufficient to require protective equipment.

In an exotic atmosphere, sulphur compounds might
represent the result of prolonged and careless
heavy industrialisation. Other components of the
atmosphere could include oxygen, nitrogen and might
be breathable if the taint could be filtered out. In
other cases, sulphur compounds can be encountered
as part of the natural atmosphere of a world and
go hand-in-hand with large-scale volcanic activity.
Sulphur compounds would be a good alternative to
the usual carbon-based organic chemistry, giving rise
to totally alien life forms.

IRRITANT AND^

CORROSIVE ATMOSPHERES
Some atmosphere compositions are directly harmful
to objects and people due to chemical reactions. The
mildest of these are termed ‘irritant’ atmospheres
and might be considered a subset of either exotic
or corrosive, depending on the degree of protection
required. Irritant atmospheres are unlikely to damage
equipment, at least in the short to medium term, but will
harm exposed skin. An irritant atmosphere would cause
damage to the respiratory system of anyone breathing it
but this is not usually an issue since a Traveller exposed
to the irritant without breathing equipment would have
more immediate problems. However, a leaky seal or
inadequate contact protection can result in harm.

Some atmospheres are considered to be ‘occasional
corrosive’. These are normally just unbreathable,
therefore falling into the exotic category but

###### Planetary Environments

depending on conditions can become far more
dangerous. An example might be a nitrogen
atmosphere which occasionally precipitates nitric
acid. The atmosphere itself might be perfectly
safe (with an oxygen supply) or only mildly irritant.
However, given the possibility of sudden corrosive
effects such a world would normally be considered to
have a corrosive atmosphere. Travellers might arrive
on such a planet and wonder why it was mislabelled,
only to find out in a lethal manner.

Corrosive atmospheres may have a variety of
chemicals in their gas mix, including nitrogen,
ammonia, chlorine, sulphur and fluorine. The latter
is highly reactive, to the point where interactions
with unprotected equipment can be violent. Fluorine
shares many properties with chlorine, including the
possibility of supporting completely alien forms of
life. It is easily detected by smell and by colour but
quickly lethal if a major leak occurs.

INSIDIOUS ATMOSPHERES
An insidious atmosphere is defined as being similar in
nature to corrosive but capable of defeating standard
personal protective measures in 2D hours. Most of the
atmospheres described as being corrosive in nature
can, in sufficient concentrations or under the right
temperature or pressure conditions, be considered
insidious. For example, a planet with high percentages
of chlorine in its atmosphere at an Earth-like pressure
and temperature could be expected to have large
amounts of hydrogen chloride gas in the air and seas
of liquid hydrochloric acid. Hydrogen chloride droplets
would condense on exposed portions of a vacc suit,
working their way into joints and crevices, and might
eventually cause the suit integrity to give way entirely in
dozens of small but lethal leaks.

An atmosphere made up of simple hydrogen would
be insidious and extremely dangerous. Hydrogen
is composed of the smallest and lightest of all
atoms, which are so small that they can seep right
through fabrics, plastics and even solid metal in a
process known as diffusion. An air-tight seal is not
necessarily hydrogen-tight. Starship hulls and the
walls of buildings can be sealed against hydrogen
leakage but vacc suits, however, cannot be built with
sufficient resistance to hydrogen diffusion; to do so
would cause the suit to be far too bulky to allow the
wearer to move freely. Hydrogen is not poisonous
but can combine explosively with oxygen. A spark
can cause an explosion, followed by the precipitation
of drops of water – the product of the combination
of these two elements. Hydrogen will make up a
significant proportion of the atmosphere on large,
cold worlds and is often found in combination with
methane and ammonia.

Temperature can also be the factor which makes an
atmosphere insidious. For example, Venus has an
atmosphere composed largely of carbon dioxide, a
gas which is not corrosive in nature. However, the
temperature on Venus is in the neighbourhood of
480°C, and the pressure 90 times that of Earth at sea
level. These atmospheric conditions can be considered
insidious. High levels of radiation or radioactive
materials in the atmosphere can also cause it to be
considered insidious. It is difficult to shield individual
suits against the effects of intense radiation such as
might be encountered on a planet very close to a large
hot sun, within the radiation zone of a gas giant or on a
world suffering the after-effects of a recent nuclear war.
Life might be possible in an insidious environment but
it would be of a type unknown to human science. The
possibilities for meaningful interaction are very small.

Major finds should always be placed by the Referee
in a logical manner. Ideally, the region of space
ahead of the Travellers’ exploration mission should be
sketched out ahead of time. This way the Referee can
decide if there is something to be found and perhaps
leave clues to its location for the Travellers to find.
Development work of this sort need not be wasted
if the Travellers sail blithely past without noticing
anything. The find, whatever it was, can be relocated
to another suitable location.

However, it is not always possible to prepare for
every direction the Travellers might go, nor how far. A
series of yet-another-rockball systems may become
boring for the Travellers, so it is desirable to throw in
the occasional minor point of interest. These can be
fleshed out by the Referee as needed, or discarded if
the Travellers choose to ignore it.

The process of determining a point of interest
requires a 2D roll on the Points of Interest table to
determine the general type, followed by a 1D roll
which indicates the specifics. Most of these results
are of relatively minor interest but could expand into
an adventure if the Travellers choose to investigate
or something goes wrong.

**ANOMALY**

The Travellers become or are made aware that there
is something strange in their stellar neighbourhood.
Minor anomalies will usually be astrophysical in
nature, such as flaring of a previously stable star or
a rogue asteroid entering the system, whilst a major
anomaly may be something more mysterious such
as a weird fluctuation in the gravity field around
an object. Anomalies can also include spacetime
anomalies such as jumpspace reefs, shoals or
currents. Extremely strange phenomena, such as
jumpspace trenches or star systems subject to
impossible physics, should be placed by the Referee
rather than allowed to turn up on a random roll.

Anomalies should always have a plausible explanation,
even if it is a downright weird one. Traveller is a
hard-ish science fiction game, so whilst anomalies
that cannot be explained with current science are
acceptable, silliness for its own sake is not. Anomalies
can turn out to be false alarms or the product of the
crew’s fatigued imagination but if the anomaly turns
out to be something real, the Referee should decide
how significant it is. A new alien civilisation will be in
the setting forever, while a star that goes nova and
incinerates its mainworld will have widespread effects –
and rather permanent ones in the local vicinity!

ENCOUNTER
The Travellers have encountered evidence of people.
Most commonly this will be the ruins of a vanished
mid-tech or lower civilisation, or a species still at the
pointy-stick level of technology. Occasionally there
may be signs of spacefarers, or even an encounter
with them. Again, these are likely to be mid-tech
people exploring their solar system in primitive craft or
users of sublight vessels.

Civilisations might salvage jump drives from early
Solomani expeditions or be on their way to a sort of
proto-jump drive but there is a limit to how often this
rationale can be used. No means of faster-than-light
travel other than the jump drive is known in the Charted
Space universe, so introducing such technology would
be a big change to the setting. The Referee is, of
course, free to do as they like in their own games but
big changes should be made with care.

**MAIN WORLD**

There is something interesting about a world in the
warm zone of the star system. A paradise world is
almost too good to be true and may be a rich source
of supplies. A habitable world is less welcoming
but still near-perfect for humans, whilst a hell world
might look like it is but conceal some nasty surprises.
Mainworlds might also have an unusual ecosphere or
conditions such as an ice age, or have developed life
based on an entirely different set of conditions to the
oxygen-nitrogen norm.

OUTSYSTEM WORLD
There is something unusual about one or more bodies
in the outer system. This will usually be physical
conditions such as a highly eccentric or retrograde orbit
but other conditions are possible. A close binary planet
pair would certainly be interesting, as would a ‘world’
that is actually a cluster of large planetoids and dwarf
planets orbiting about a common point.

PHENOMENA
Most points of interest are impressive or scientifically
significant without being inexplicable. A gas giant
with particularly beautiful rings or an incredibly
complex moon system would be a sight worth
seeing, as would many other unusual but ‘normal’
phenomena. Flaring from a star or the aurora created
by solar wind in the atmosphere of a highly magnetic
planet are noteworthy phenomena without being
considered anomalies.

###### Finds and Points of Interest

TRAVELLER

ROGUE BODIES
The system has one or more major rogue bodies
associated with it. A gas giant in the process of
ejecting its moons from the system, or one that is in
the process of being captured, would be interesting
to space scientists. A planet or even a star moving
through the central system would cause utter mayhem
which would certainly be worth studying.

RUINS
Ruins might indicate the presence of a low to mid-
tech civilisation, or perhaps turn out to be natural
phenomena that merely resemble structures from a
distance. Ruins on bodies where life could not evolve
or exist unaided are of particular interest as they
indicate interstellar travel of some kind; ruins in this
context implies abandoned structures but it is possible
they are inhabited by a remnant of the builders, or
someone else has moved in to make use of them.
These new inhabitants could be dangerous creatures
and indeed the ruin might not have been made by
intelligent people at all. It could be the nest of a
space-going creature or large planet-based animal –
and it might or might not be abandoned.

**SIGHTING**

What appears to be evidence of a starship or space-
going creature is sighted. This may be a direct
observation or secondary evidence such as gravity
‘ripples’ from a jumping starship. Any new starfaring
species is likely to be of great interest to the
Confederation. However, a sighting does not need to
be something new. It could be ships from the Aslan
Hierate, the Hive Federation or even the Imperium,
or lost colonists from the Rule of Man who have
regained starflight.

SYSTEM COMPOSITION
The composition of the system varies considerably
from the norm. This may indicate additional stars
or a distant companion with far more planets than
would normally be expected. Alternatively, the system
might have an unusual distribution of bodies, such
as an almost empty inner system but multiple planets
orbiting very far out, or the bodies may lie in eccentric
orbits. A system with more than one potentially
habitable planet would be a rare find.

STELLAR BODY
There is something unusual about a nearby star or
stellar body. A star system orbiting a black hole or
neutron star, or orbiting a star that orbits one, would
be highly unusual, as would a supergiant star or
brown dwarf as the primary of a system. Alternatively,
a stellar body might have unusual characteristics
such as being composed of a different element mix
to the norm, or it might be a T-Tauri star or protostar
in the process of forming. The unusual stellar body
might not be the primary of a system; it could be a
distant companion or a rogue body passing through
nearby space.

TRANSMISSION
The Travellers pick up what appears to be a
transmission. It may come from an automated
beacon or might have been transmitted long ago and
far away. The signal might turn out to be a natural
phenomenon with no meaning, or it could be a trap.
Alternatively, a signal could be a distress call or
almost anything else.

WINDFALL
The Travellers get lucky, finding something useful or
valuable. This might be directly beneficial like a rich
source of supplies or exotic materials, or something
valuable in the long term such as information on a
lost expedition found in the wreck of their starship. A
windfall might also turn out to be a death-trap, luring
crewmembers in with the promise of wonders and
riches before the real situation presents itself.

###### Finds and Points of Interest

Interactions with other people are an essential part of
most Traveller games but opportunities might be few
and far between out on the rim. Discovering intelligent
life is part of the exploration mission, with the added
bonus of finding someone to talk to. However, any
new alien species added to the campaign brings with
it new complexities and too many can strain credulity
and/or the Referee’s creativity. This is a particular
problem away from Charted Space, in areas where
the Ancients were not active.

The Ancients were responsible for transplanting
animals, plants and people from one world to another,
which can be convenient for the Referee. Instead
of inventing a whole ecosystem for every world the
Travellers visit, it is much simpler to assume that many
of the same species are present on the majority of
worlds. This is simply not possible in regions where this
transplantation did not take place. Indeed, encountering
a [[Terra|Terran]] creature or plant, or one known to be native
to another world, is grounds to begin asking questions.
Whilst this can be something of a nuisance for the
Referee, it is a major characteristic of the exploration
campaign style. The presence of familiar flora and
fauna must therefore be carefully considered.

The question of intelligent life is an even tricker one.
The Referee will no doubt want to include people for
the Travellers to discover, study and interact with but
it is necessary to be careful when doing so. Adding
multiple aliens to a sector requires a lot of creativity
and work, and too many creates the impression of a
menagerie. In most cases these people will be confined
to a single world. This can create a ‘planet of the week’
style campaign where the Travellers encounter a new
set of aliens almost every session, then never have
any interactions with them again. These civilisations
are now in the setting, however, and realistically the
Confederation would want to send follow-up missions to
study them and perhaps develop a working relationship.

These problems can be alleviated by assuming at
least some starfaring took place in the region at some
point. However, the jump drive is the only known
method of faster-than-light travel and has only been
independently developed by the Major Races of
Charted Space. A Referee can do what they like in
their own campaign, of course, but the discovery of a

# A LIENS AND POPULATIONS

new Major Race with independently developed jump
drives would attract a lot of interest. A civilisation
which had created some other means of faster-than-
light travel would be a truly monumental discovery.
Adding a civilisation of this nature would certainly
be interesting but the Referee needs to consider the
implications for the campaign.

There are some options if the Referee wants to add
some intelligent species to more than one world in
the campaign or to re-use animals and plants created
earlier. Slower-than-light interstellar travel makes it
possible to transport people and creatures from one
system to another, at least over a limited range. If some
local civilisation arose in the distant past and reached
out very slowly to the stars, they may have seeded
many worlds with their people and their homeworld
species. This is more than a worldbuilding device; it is a
deep mystery to be built into the campaign.

If the Travellers discover people of the same
species on multiple worlds, they must have got
there somehow. This means they possess or once
possessed starships of some kind and that there is
a homeworld somewhere. Perhaps some of their
colonies have died out or regressed to barbarism
whilst others retained their technology. There is the
potential for months of campaign time spent finding
these populations and studying them.

NEW STARFARERS
If the Referee wants starfaring aliens in the campaign
they will need some form of faster-than-light travel. It is
highly unlikely that the jump drive was locally invented
but individual Referees are not bound by this. As an
alternative, at least in the Rimward Region, aliens may
have obtained the jump drive from humans. Whilst
there is a powerful injunction on trading sensitive
technology – and the jump drive may be the most
sensitive of them all – there will always be those willing
to ignore it. This could be simply out of a desire for
profit, or a form of altruism. Perhaps someone decided
it was unfair to keep these aliens ignorant or just
wanted to cause trouble for the Confederation.

Alternatively, the aliens might have reverse-engineered
a drive they found aboard a Solomani or Rule of Man-
era wreck. It is also possible that an alien civilisation

TRAVELLER

might have developed a proto-jump drive that works
just well enough to get them to other systems. If it
is prone to misjump, this species could have widely
scattered enclaves or may have seeded species on
planets before their tiny lost colony died out.

There are numerous human populations in the
Rimward Region, of which many are descended
from Rule of Man-era missions. Some of these were
sublight, others used jump drives. The latter arrived
in the region earlier than the sublight missions and
have had more time to develop or perhaps collapse.
Those that used generation ships or low berths arrived
later and, in the case of those using suspended
animation, are culturally closer to Old Earth due to less
generations in between their departure and discovery
by the Confederation. Generation ship populations may
have developed a very different culture along the way.

It is also possible the Travellers may encounter other
known species. The most likely candidates are Aslan
and the many races of the Hive Federation. Others
are possible, although how and why they came is
a question requiring a good answer. Perhaps these
groups were dissidents, who now have a very different
culture to that back home. This might be their reason
for leaving, potentially causing tension if the Solomani
assist them. The likelihood of a distant power finding
out about this is small but it is still a factor.

The Referee should keep in mind that a species
that developed on a given world will have different
characteristics to one that arrived from elsewhere.
A species that runs through the whole cycle of
development on its world of origin will usually upgrade
and build over existing settlements even if this is sub-
optimal. A colony may have more of a planned look
and less legacy technology in place. Few civilisations
will inflict upon themselves the expense of replacing
everything as soon as it becomes obsolescent, so it is
common for a mix of Tech Levels to be encountered on
‘old’ worlds. This is particularly true in remote areas far
from the main population centres.

Travellers observing an inhabited world will be able
to determine with reasonable accuracy whether it is a
colony or a homeworld by this method. This becomes
particularly interesting when a species thinks it is
native to its current home but is clearly not. Even
if the locals do not want to reveal much about their
history, explorers may be able to piece some of
it together from the physical evidence. At some
point, however, direct interaction is necessary if the
explorers want to find out more.

MEETING PEOPLE
The amount the Travellers know about a given
culture or species can be modelled with the Universal
Research Mechanic. As a general rule it is not possible
to obtain a BI higher than 5 just by observation or
analysis of artefacts. After this point, the researchers
need to interact with the subjects or obtain access to
their records. It may be possible to ask other cultures
about the subjects, but of course there is no guarantee
they will tell the truth.

Almost any observation, even just a few minutes, is
sufficient to jump to a Breakthrough Index of 3. This
correlates to an impression of physical characteristics,
Tech Level and general way of life. ‘Low-tech
humanoids, dwelling in scattered farming communities’
is an example of this level of data. It is possible to
reach a Breakthrough Index of 5 by way of observing
a culture from space over the course of a few days.
At this point the explorers will have a solid impression
of Tech Level, level of industrialisation, transportation
in use and basic physical data on the people they
are studying. It should be possible to estimate how
violent they are to one another, although predicting the
outcome of a first contact situation is uncertain.

Beyond BI 5, extremely long-term observation is
necessary for each increase and much of the data
will be inferred and unreliable. Friendly contact and a
reasonably free flow of information will advance BI at
the rate of +1 every 2D days multiplied by the new BI
level. Thus going from BI 5 to 6 (sufficient to publish
a layman-level book about the culture) will take 2Dx6
days, or an average of about 42 days of interaction. It
is not possible to achieve a BI of more than 10 without
years of detailed study. It is unlikely the Travellers will
uncover all the details about a species’ entire history
and even if they do these details may have been
misremembered or discreetly altered to avoid admitting
to embarrassing or shameful incidents.

There is no real need to research most encountered
species in this depth. From an astronavigational point
of view it is sufficient to know there is a local civilisation
present and its Tech Level. Scientists may want more
data but unless a culture is particularly interesting, a
promising ally or trade contact, studying it is likely to
be a low priority. At present, the whole rimward area
of interest is very much at the broad brush stage of
exploration, with focus only possible at key points of
interest or close to a forward base.

###### Aliens and Populations

The Solomani Confederation defines the region within
200 parsecs of the rimward border to be its ‘Close
Rimward Area of Interest’. This is a rather grandiose
declaration, covering an area of about 100 by 200
parsecs, or 15 whole sectors. Even without other
concerns to keep the bulk of the navy busy, an area
three times the size of the Confederation itself is a
great deal of territory in which to operate. However,
this is the region through which all expeditions further
rimward must pass and into which the Confederation
will expand at some point. The Aslan Hierate to
spinward and the Hive Federation to trailing are both
known to be interested in the area rimward of them.
The Confederation considers it important to keep the
three-parsec corridor open for future expansion. This
is something of an obsession in some quarters. The
logic is that without expansion there is ultimately only
stagnation, so the Confederation absolutely cannot
afford to be cut off from the rimward frontier.

The key facet of Confederation policy in the region is
the Rimward Corridor. No need is perceived to annex
territory for the sake of maintaining a transit route, so
long as the corridor is not seriously threatened. There
are a few nearby worlds which possess starfaring
technology and even some minor powers. These are
not able to threaten the Confederation as a whole
but might interfere with shipping moving through the
corridor if they thought they could get away with it.
However, since these powers are in the low-starfaring
technology category it is not hard to remind them they
are outmatched. Even obsolete TL12 Solomani warships
are technological wonders to the people of these worlds.

This highly advanced stick is paired with a generous
policy of trade and assistance for friendly worlds.
Trans-border trade with the systems within 10 parsecs
or so of the Confederation border is commonplace and
information is readily available in the public databases.
As a result, these worlds tend to be friendly or at
least highly respectful towards Confederation assets.
Beyond this narrow zone data is harder to come by and
those who have obtained it tend not to make it public.
This does not mean nothing is known about the worlds
in this region; it is more that those in the know prefer to
keep secret their advantages.

# T HE CLOSE RIMWARD REGION

Beyond the trans-border region, a corridor roughly six
parsecs wide pushes rimward through the Hanstone
sector and beyond. Ships using the corridor tend to transit
via the same systems but a presence is maintained on
each side of it. Sometimes this is naval vessels but the
Confederation has taken other measures to maintain
the security of the corridor. Merchant vessels and supply
ships plying this route are well-armed – by the standards
of civilian craft at least – and are paid a subsidy to wander
a little off the well-trodden route.

The corridor is not the only route to rimward. Armed
merchant ships routinely make the long transit
to friendly worlds two or more sectors from the
Confederation border, stopping at local ports along
the way. Naval patrols are less common but there are
several rather long-in-the-tooth cruisers assigned to
show the flag and assist local forces when requested.

The Rimward Corridor might be thought of as a
system of arteries aligned generally to rimward, with
smaller blood vessels branching off here and there.
Relations have been developed with various local
governments to the point where Confederation bases
are not deemed necessary in the first two sectors out
from the border. The first significant Confederation
presence is in the Lubbock sector, around 100
parsecs from the Confederation Border.

The primary route is fairly direct to rimward through
the Hanstone, Hollowon and Lubbock sectors before
branching near the rimward end of Mithen. The main
arm continues rimward and slightly to spinward into
Mithen and Hadley, whilst the Kruse Branch swings
across to trailing as it enters the Kruse sector. This is
largely for astrographic reasons; the Ruthless Veil and
Darkly Veiled sectors contain a number of known time-
space anomalies, including jump shoals and jump reefs.

The trailing side of the Close Rimward Area of Interest
is of lesser importance than the spinward sectors.
Short-range exploration and trade missions push out
from the Confederation border as far as the middle
of RimReach but there are rumours of a highly
dangerous form of life in the rimward end of the sector
as well as astrographic obstacles to further progress.
A forward base in the Strange sector is tasked with
supporting cautious research into this threat, as well as
investigation of the Flous Nebula and Strange sectors.

or attempts to obtain information that does not
seem necessary will require higher security access,
persuasion or some other method.

Some data will be partial, some incorrect and
some potentially could be deliberately false.
Travellers who are plugged into the explorer
community may be able to get more data or
cross-reference it, and some normally restricted
information will be readily available as a courtesy
from others who operate on the corridor. This
is particularly true of worlds located where they
are likely to be visited by ships operating in the
corridor, as well as notorious trouble spots.

Beyond this, however, the Referee can decide
what is on or just off the corridor. It is unlikely
there will be major threats or obstacles right on
the main transit route but pocket empires, friendly
worlds, local trade hubs and other features can
produce unexpected adventures. The conflicts
and troubles of worlds along the route may cause
disruption or unanticipated opportunities. This is
a very open region, in which Referees can place
almost anything they find interesting.

**SYSTEM DATA**
The Solomani Confederation and its precursors
are characterised by a certain level of
secretiveness and routinely conceal or suppress
information they do not want to be readily
available. Usually there is no specific reason for
this; just day-to-day security. One consequence
is that those without the correct security
clearance have little way to tell whether there is
no information on a given star system because it
contains something to be kept secret, or whether
the data is just secured like everything else.

The Rimward Corridor has been explored for
centuries, although with no great urgency. Basic
information – at the least – exists on most systems
in the region and some around it. Star types and
general world classifications represented by the
first three digits of a system profile will more than
likely be available to those who can demonstrate a
need for the information. The conditions for basic
navigational data are not strict – anyone who has
received approval for a mission along the corridor
will be able to obtain routine information on their
general area of operations. More specific requests

###### The Close Rimward Region

The Lubbock Enclave is the first significant
Confederation asset rimward of its borders. Established
in the 750s by the (then) Solomani Autonomous
Region, the Enclave began as a modest colony on a
suitable garden world, with resource-extraction facilities
in the surrounding systems. It has been constantly
expanded ever since and is now a ‘pocket empire’ of 12
fully controlled star systems.

The Lubbock Enclave is entirely Solomani in outlook
and loyal to the Confederation. Indeed, its shipyards
produce a small number of vessels for use in the
main Confederation Navy. This is more a political
gesture than anything else; the Enclave receives
more from the Confederation than it provides and
most of its ships are used to protect nearby sections
of the Rimward Corridor.

The Enclave is not really an exploration base any
more, although it does serve as a support installation
for missions headed out from the Confederation. Most
of its activities are directed towards monitoring and
curtailing Aslan incursions into the sector and acting
as a turnaround point for supply ships coming down
the corridor. Supply and support vessels travelling
to Forward Base in the Kruse sector usually stop
over at Lubbock before proceeding. Most others turn
around here and head back after a period of rest and
maintenance. Support missions headed further to
rimward are normally launched using the resources of
the Lubbock Enclave. One consequence of this is that
personnel from the Confederation rarely go further
than Lubbock or Kruse. For most people, the universe
pretty much ends here.

The Enclave has its own fleet of support vessels and
auxiliaries, all of which are well armed, as well as true
warships. About half of these are intended to operate
in the Enclave itself and trade range for capability. The
other half are the opposite; they are set up for long
patrols or power projection over great distances. The
inevitable consequence is that these ships are not

as combat capable as the warfighting vessels of the
fleets facing the Imperium but with no major threats
the forces of the Lubbock Enclave are adequate for
the tasks assigned to them.

Additionally to these purpose-built forces, the Lubbock
Enclave received large amounts of post-Imperial
equipment after the Solomani Confederation achieved
independence. More from wilfulness than necessity,
the Confederation set about replacing its legacy Scout
Service equipment with Solomani designs. Often the
differences were stylistic as much as practical, although
in some cases the new ships were better suited to the
needs of the Confederation.

Notably, the Solomani Confederation got rid of
most of the inherited x-boats that had previously
connected its major worlds. The Imperial preference
for boats incapable of independent manoeuvre
was in many ways efficient but it created a need
for support tenders. The Confederation replaced its
x-boats with more versatile couriers. In some cases
this meant building a new vessel around jump drives
removed from x-boats, although later examples were
constructed from the keel up. Many of these first-
generation x-boat replacements, along with scout/
couriers and survey scouts, were sent rimward to
equip the Lubbock and Kruse bases.

Today, many of these craft are still in service. Refitted,
modified and rebuilt several times over, they form the
backbone of local operations. A veritable horde of
venerable scout/couriers operates in the subsectors
around the Lubbock Enclave, constantly increasing
and updating the information available about the
surrounding systems. Locally built vessels are more
capable, since they are built to TL13 standards but
there are few facilities capable of servicing them
whilst the TL12 Imperial scouts are much easier to
support. A growing number have reached the end of
their useful lives however and are gradually being
cannibalised to keep others in operation.

# T HE LUBBOCK ENCLAVE

The Horden subsector contains 22 star systems of
which 12 are the sovereign territory of the Lubbock
Enclave of the Solomani Confederation. The
remainder are ‘of interest’ and see regular patrols
and deployments of naval vessels. These are mostly
scientific in nature but also fulfil the requirements of
search and rescue and territorial control.

The Rimward Corridor branches in this sector, with
the ‘local’ or ‘Kruse’ arm running directly to rimward
into the Mithen sector before curving away to rimward-
trailing towards Kruse. Ships headed there will almost
always stop over at the Lubbock Enclave before
completing their trip. The main arm diverts slightly
to spinward after the Horden subsector. This is the
standard path for vessels headed out on long-range
exploration missions. The Rimward Corridor has been

scouted for another 200 parsecs, but little attention
has been paid to anything outside it. The emphasis is
on permitting a fast transit out to the distant regions
targeted by the mission, with less grand exploration
carried out on a slower basis.

AVEBURY
Avebury is the capital and primary manufacturing
centre for the Enclave. Its system defence flotilla might
seem excessively strong for such a remote location
but the world is of critical importance to the future of
the Solomani Confederation and has been provided
with suitable protection. Avebury has the only military
shipyard in the enclave. Kingsgate could build warships
at need but specialises in scientific and support vessels.

# H ORDEN SUBSECTOR

HORDEN SUBSECTOR

Lubbock

H

Routine maintenance on ships plying the Rimward
Corridor is normally conducted at Kingsgate but
Avebury is better set up for major repairs.

The Lubbock Enclave Administration, locally known
as ‘the Lubb’ is housed at Avebury. This is the
governmental apparatus for all worlds within the
Enclave and also the diplomatic centre for contact with
local governments. All exploration and scientific data
is marshalled here before being conveyed back to the
Confederation. The University of Avebury is co-located
with the Lubb, providing a mix of academic instruction
and practical training as well as conducting cutting-
edge research. The university owns several exploration
vessels and in addition handles almost all scientific
work arising from missions launched out of the Enclave.

Avebury is a pleasant world to live on. It cannot claim
to be the first settlement in the Enclave – that was
Landfall – but the system was selected to be the hub
within a few years of first colonisation. A little drier than
Earth, Avebury has a basic ecosystem of its own which
is gradually being replaced by [[Terra|Terran]] species. After
a few centuries, extensive forests have grown up in
designated wilderness areas near the original cities, with
new neo-[[Terra|Terran]] areas seeded whenever additional cities
were built. Today, most settlements are surrounded by
a ‘[[Terra|Terran]] belt’ of farmland and forest containing familiar
species. Beyond this, the original ecosystem tries to
resist invasion but is steadily losing ground.

Governance is representative and fairly democratic but
since positions of high office are only open to Solomani
Party candidates there is a limit to how much variance
can exist. Elected representatives advise appointed
officials on the wishes of the populace and in general
they are heeded whenever possible. The planetary
government is staunchly pro-Confederation but is
willing to balance the desires of its people against the
need to serve the Confederation in the capacity the
Enclave was set up for.

Avebury is also the seat of the Enclave government,
which operates in a similar manner. Representatives
from the worlds of the Enclave advise the officials who
make the big decisions and these officials are – in
theory at least – appointed by the Secretariat of the
Solomani Party. In practice most are assigned their roles
locally and the Secretariat finds out about it months
later. Authority devolves from the Secretariat, which
can remove any official from their post or send out new
personnel to replace a corrupt or inept administration.
In practice, so long as the Enclave fulfils its mission, the
Secretariat is content just to send the odd auditing party
out on the long haul from Home to Avebury.

HALLSTAT
Hallstatt is not a member world of the Enclave but
is under its control in all meaningful ways. It was
settled during the late Rule of Man era by one of many
missions that headed generally rimward. Although
small and dry, Hallstatt had reasonably good accessible
resources and should have been a solid prospect
for long-term success. However, within a century the
project ran into trouble. The infrastructure required
to maintain a technologically advanced colony was
becoming unviable and with no prospect of outside
assistance measures had to be taken.

The colony administrators’ solution was to carefully
establish a mid-tech society whilst they had the
resources to do so. Unfortunately, the decision was
not popular. Few colonists wanted to move from
their high technology homes to the new and rather
basic towns being built for them. Some accepted the
situation, whilst the majority tried to keep the lights
on with wishful thinking... and later violence. Conflict
over dwindling resources resulted in a sudden
collapse. Technological cities became death-traps
and ironically those who had refused to give up their
technology fell the furthest.

The next few hundred years were characterised
by conflict between the mid-tech communities and
what amounted to techno-barbarians. Nobody won;
civilisation collapsed at some point in the Long
Night and by the time the first explorers from the
Solomani Autonomous Region reached Hallstatt the
world had settled at TL1. According to records held
at Lubbock, the planetary population is about 700
but this reflects the Enclave presence rather than
the indigenous population.

The Enclave has a research installation on-planet,
conducting anthropological observation of the
regressed local culture. The rest of the world is home
to iron-age tribes who retain distorted oral traditions
of their former time of greatness. The old cities are
deeply buried under vegetation and soil deposition,
and are taboo to the locals. Memories of a conflict
between those who possessed magic-like technology
and those who wanted it persist, making relations
with the tribes rather prickly at times and downright
hostile at others. Attempts to recruit local workers for
archaeological expeditions into the old cities have
rarely produced useful results.

TRAVELLER

ADVENTURES IN^

THE LUBBOCK ENCLAVE
The Lubbock Enclave itself is small but there are many
opportunities for adventure in this area. The internal
politics of a region so far from central government can
be complex, especially when long-range missions are
being set up. The Enclave administration must juggle
the requirements of the expeditions it was set up to
support against its own standing orders and the need
to maintain the Enclave as a viable entity. Plundering
the reserves of the Enclave to support a mission might
seem like a good solution in the short term but a severe
shortage of something vital could be disastrous.

There are always scientific and exploration missions
to undertake, and these must be supported. The
Travellers might find themselves working in logistics
or search and rescue, which will be a lot less
mundane than it might be elsewhere. The area
surrounding the Enclave is not uncharted but it is
untamed. Diplomacy is another adventuring option;
local world governments and minor states may want
assistance or try to extort tribute from the Enclave.
This could be quite laughable, as a tiny state with
primitive spaceships threatens to attack the Solomani
Confederation. However, the Enclave does not want to
be distracted by conflict and nobody is likely to forget
the lessons of the Interstellar Wars.

There is also the security mission. Locally, this is mostly
about reminding world governments of the power
and capability of the Confederation. Flag-showing
and demonstrations that ‘happen to be witnessed’
are normally all that is needed, whilst the occasional
intervention on behalf of a government allows for a

useful demonstration of power – assuming it is well
handled. The Enclave’s naval forces are often sent on
peacekeeping or assistance missions that apparently
have nothing to do with the Enclave’s policies. Those
who see the bigger picture know why this is done.

The Enclave has a unique function; to monitor
the exploration activities of rival powers. Concern
is greatest for the Aslan Hierate but missions are
also sent trailingward to see what can be learned
about the Hive Federation’s operations. These are
astrographically complex due to conditions in the
Ruthless Veil and Darkly Veiled sectors. This, coupled
with the difficulty of determining what the Hivers are
up to – if anything – creates a strong argument for
curtailment and concentration in the spinward direction.

The Aslan are less subtle than the Hivers and usually
leave a trail to follow. Their ihatei expeditions have
been known to push a considerable distance beyond
the borders of the Hierate, occasionally managing to
set up a pocket empire. Aslan expansion is always
of concern and keeping their ihatei away from the
Rimward Corridor is one of the missions the Lubbock
Enclave was created for.

The Enclave is also concerned with a Minor Race
called the Inyx, who occupy several worlds of the
Ahriman sector to spinward of Lubbock. The Inyx are
complex creatures consisting of an intelligent parasitic
creature and a humanoid host which may or may not
be sentient. The Inyx were contacted sometime in
the Long Night and have always preferred peaceful
relations with other species. They also appear to have
little territorial ambition. However, they are there, so the
Enclave must monitor them. Some trade passes back
and forth but thus far the Inyx have resisted all attempts
to learn much about them.

###### Horden Subsector

The Kruse sector lies in a region of great scientific
interest to the Confederation. In addition to supporting
general exploration outward in all directions, it
is tasked with investigating the anomalies in the
Ruthless Veil, Darkly Veiled and Strange sectors
as well as the possibility of some major threat in
RimReach. Construction of Forward Base Kruse was
first begun in the 830s, with a different ethos to the
Lubbock Enclave. Where Lubbock was intended to
be – and still is – the turnaround point for staging and
support missions, Kruse was set up as a dedicated
exploration and scientific base.

There are two starfaring civilisations present in Kruse –
humans and the Rammak. The latter have a few worlds
in the Ivy subsector, whilst humans are more varied. In
addition to the Kruse Enclave, there are multiple low
to mid-tech human populations descended from failed
colony missions and some groups that have managed
to retain or regain starflight. If not otherwise indicated,
any population should be assumed to be human.

POLITIES OF KRUSE
Humans first reached Kruse early in the Long Night,
probably around -1750. At that time it was not
necessarily apparent that the Second Imperium was
collapsing. There were certainly tough times ahead
but there were also causes for optimism. It is not clear
whether the expedition to Kruse was launched in hope
of better times or to escape what was coming. It is also
possible that the colonists wanted to get away from
enemies within the Rule of Man’s territory.

A multi-ship expedition entered Kruse after being
scattered and taking losses in the Hoydell’s Chaos
region. Some vessels found one another and operated
jointly, although divisions caused some groups to split off
again. Other ships found habitable worlds elsewhere. It
is possible that some continued rimward, although drive
wear must have been a severe factor by this point.

The largest group settled in what is now designated as
the Kane subsector, establishing a multi-world empire
that proved far too ambitious for the available resources.
Spread thin, the surviving ships plied between the newly
colonised worlds to maintain contact but none had the
resources to help the others. The resulting downward

spiral culminated in total collapse on some worlds, with
others stabilising at a mid-Tech Level. Other missions
fared little better on the worlds they claimed but in two
cases the colonists were able to retain or regain jump
drive technology. Both set about building an interstellar
state but in very different ways.

THE SOVEREIGNTY
One of the best equipped vessels of the flotilla landed on
a world the crew named Insula Suverana or Sovereign
Island. Some exploration of the surrounding area took
place but the need to husband the remaining jump-life
of their vessel confined the colonists to one system for
a long time. As with most colonial missions, it had long
been accepted that the high technology of the Rule of
Man could not be fully sustained. Insula Suverana dealt
with this problem this in a hard-nosed manner, creating a
small high-technology base which permitted dominance
over the majority of the population.

The ruling elite enjoyed a TL12 lifestyle for a time,
although sustaining it was a problem. A slow descent
to TL10 eventually bottomed out, with knowledge of
higher-technology concepts retained even after the
ability to build devices had been lost. The majority
of the populace were given homes in cities built to a
roughly TL6 level. Advanced knowledge was combined
with simple methods to create a fission-powered
utilitarian society. This low-end/high-end setup was
accompanied by predictable social injustice, although
unrest was limited by providing favoured members of
the mass population access to high-tech medical care
and labour-saving devices.

Society eventually settled into acceptance of the new
order. ‘Eltees’ (from LT, standing for Low-Tech) could
hope to be elevated into the ranks of the Elites if they
served well and higher-tech equipment was available
for important tasks such as interstellar commerce and
population suppression. There are today two distinct
echelons of society; the Eltees and Elites, with those
who serve the Elites directly forming a privileged
middle class. Laws are strict and in some cases
intended to do nothing more than remind the Eltees
they are not as good as their overlords. The word-
play of the two social echelons is quite deliberate and
apparently amusing to the upper class.

# K RUSE

The Sovereignty, as the Elites’ little empire is named,
consists of the homeworld and a few offworld
possessions. There is no desire to expand unless
territory is required for its resources. The Elites like to
keep their enemies – the Eltees – close and everyone
else at arm’s length. Essentially, the Eltee class live
dull and utilitarian lives with limited prospects for
advancement unless an Elite needs their talents. As
far as the Elites are concerned, Eltees exist to provide
labour for the projects of the Elites and should be
grateful for what they have. Unrest is common but
a combination of tiny concessions, propaganda in
the Elite-controlled media and the occasional brutal
suppression serve to keep it within acceptable limits.

The TL10/TL6 arrangement eventually climbed up
to TL11/TL7 but is unlikely to advance much more
in the near future. Sovereignty starships are built to
TL11 standards and commanded by Elites. Crews are
from the servant-Eltee class and generally loyal to
their masters. Most ships are designed for trade over
long distances, making visits to the regressed human
colonies or other interstellar powers. They are well
enough armed to serve as merchant cruisers when
force is necessary and the home system has a modest
but capable sublight defence squadron.

Although they are of Solomani extraction, the people
of the Sovereignty have gone in a very different
direction to those of the Confederation. The Enclave
recognises them as lost kindred but does not approve
of their rigid society, whilst the Sovereignty does not
really care what anyone thinks so long as the Elites
profit from every interaction.

THE INTERSTELLAR REPUBLIC
The other most-successful colony mission to reach
Kruse dealt with the problem of technological
sustainability in a much kinder but less effective
manner. The intent had always been to establish
a roughly TL9 society and archive more advanced
knowledge against the day when the technology
it permitted could be re-implemented. This model
assumed other colonies were being set up nearby – in
astrographical terms – and could assist one another.
The world chosen as the heart of this new colonial
enclave was named Promise.

In the event, losses and diffusion resulted in multiple
collapsed and regressed colonies, forcing the
forefathers of the Interstellar Republic back on their
own resources. Their TL9 society struggled to maintain
its industrial base but refused to make anyone a

second-class citizen and as the population grew in
number the available manufacturing capability was
diluted to an ever increasing degree. Decades of slow
decline became centuries, until finally the technology
base had regressed to the upper end of TL4.
Knowledge was not lost, just the ability to apply it, and
eventually stability was achieved.

The climb back was long and slow, and not at all
assisted by visits from ships from the Sovereignty.
These came to trade but on their own terms. Gadgets
and widgets to impress were on offer rather than
industrial machinery and hard-to-manufacture items.
Prices were high, other than when the Sovereignty
wanted to flood local markets with cheap goods to
create demand for expensive ones. This situation
continued intermittently for hundreds of years but was
never a very lucrative market for Sovereignty goods.
Most of their trade ships went elsewhere.

Over 1,500 years after colonisation, the world of
Promise launched its first spacecraft. Built at a high
TL7 with concepts preserved from higher technology
knowledge, these rather basic ships conducted
exploration of the system but what they were really
exploring was technique. Lessons were incorporated
into new designs and by Imperial Year 250 the people
of Promise were confident TL8 spacefarers. The
ancient technology vaults were opened and the first
jump-capable vessel carefully assembled.

Interstellar Promise One never returned from its maiden
flight. This was a shock, since no vessel had ever been
lost. For all their caution and the lessons incorporated
from careful incremental operations, the people of
Promise had lost a ship. Their confidence was shaken
and it was a whole century before a second mission
was launched. This was no lone prototype; it was a
mission of three large vessels set up for mutual support
and assistance. They returned with reports about
nearby worlds, one of which had a human population
and overnight Promise became a starfaring nation.

More ships were built and missions explored the
surrounding systems. These were followed by colony
vessels and by 625 Promise was the first among
equals in a small but growing TL9 interstellar republic.
The colonies were never intended to be possessions
or sources of revenue; they were homes for citizens of
the republic. It was here that the enlightened policies
of the founders finally paid off. Ensuring everyone had
enough of what they needed freed those with talent
to undertake higher education and contribute to the
explosion of colonisation.

###### Kruse

TRAVELLER

As soon as a colony reached the point where it could
support itself, it became a member of the newly-minted
Interstellar Republic. This alarmed the Sovereignty to
the point where tensions boiled over into a shooting
incident between a trade ship and a Republican vessel.
This rather pathetic skirmish was the single action of
the first phase of what is now known simply as The
War. For 12 years the Sovereignty made incursions
into Republican space and thundered demands backed
up by a few more weapons than the last trade ship
had carried. Finally another fight broke out, resulting in
several single-ship actions over the next two decades
and what is grandly termed a fleet action involving
nine vessels in total. This incident horrified both sides
sufficiently that a ceasefire became desirable.

The Interstellar Republic has been at war with the
Sovereignty since 655, although the ceasefire has
held for over 400 years now. The factions are far
apart, so unless one goes looking for trouble an
encounter is unlikely. Both trade with the Enclave
and are well aware it would be a poor idea to pick
a fight in its territory. Besides, both the Interstellar
Republic and the Sovereignty have other problems.
Some of those are internal; where the Sovereignty
has squeezed its population to the point where
rebellion is only a good datanet rant away, the
Republic has created an issue by doing the opposite

Ever since the colonisation of Promise the Republic
has adhered to the principles of fairness and equal
distribution of resources. It has richer and poorer
citizens but expends a great deal of time and money
on ensuring that everyone has what they need. This
disperses resources rather thinly and has prevented
growth past TL9. The Sovereignty concentrates
resources, creating a situation in which only a few
people can get things done, whereas the Republic
disperses them with the result that more talented
people are available but they have less to work with.
Which of these philosophies will prevail in the long
term remains to be seen.

THE RULE OF MAN
Sometimes referred to as the ‘Dinosaur of Kruse’,
the self-styled Rule of Man was created by a sublight
colony mission launched in the early days of the
Second Imperium. At that time the situation was chaotic
but there was an expectation that [[Terra|Terran]]s would
create a long-lasting interstellar empire. By the time
the mission arrived in Kruse, the Second Imperium
was long gone and the Solomani people were seeking
independence from the Third Imperium.

The Rule of Man centres on the world of Trophy, close
to the fringe of the Chaos in the Chase subsector.
Contact between the colonists and explorers from
the Kruse Enclave was cordial although the people
of Trophy did not really believe ‘their’ human empire
had passed away. After an initial period of enthusiasm
the enclave decided the resources being used to
assist Trophy could be better deployed elsewhere and
contact became intermittent.

Help from the Enclave enabled Trophy to eventually
struggle up to TL9, creating a few starships and
launching its own exploration missions. Despite the
difficulties of operating close to the fringe of Hoydell’s
Chaos, Trophy set up colonies and began styling itself
the Rule of Man. This is more than a little pretentious,
given that it is essentially a single-world state with a
few outposts, but the leaders of Trophy have big plans.
They are only a few generations removed from the
heroes who threw down the mighty Vilani Imperium –
and that glorious effort began with a single-world state!

Ambitious as it may be, the Rule of Man is also
realistic. Expansion will be a long and slow process
and it is readily apparent that technology has
advanced greatly since the expedition set off. There
is some resentment that the Enclave will not share its
knowledge but there is no real or fair basis for this;
dragging a TL9 colony up to TL13 would be a difficult
business and of little direct benefit to the Enclave.
There are also political issues – the Rule of Man is a
foreign power, and there are strict rules about handing
over advanced technology. Nevertheless, the Rule of
Man feels entitled to the works of its successors.

Rule of Man ships rarely travel far from home, largely
due to their short jump range. Attempts have been made
to push a trade corridor through to the Enclave but the
commitment of resources that would require is beyond
the capabilities of Trophy and its colonies. Instead, the
Rule of Man must wait and hope for trade ships from the
Enclave, a situation its leaders find quite humiliating.

THE RAMMAK WORLDS
The Rammak are a species best described as
humanoid-ish. They have two legs and two arms
attached to a torso not dissimilar to that of a human
but the limbs have an additional joint which causes
a Rammak to move in a way many humans find
unsettling. They are capable of great feats of balance
and dexterity, suggesting they evolved in a woodland
environment and used the treetops to avoid predators.
Their heads are narrower and more elongated than
those of humans, with two sets of eyes. The main

###### Kruse

pair point forward giving binocular vision in a normal
light spectrum, whilst the second pair are larger and
located on the sides of the head. These are adapted
for poor light conditions and can see a short way into
the infrared. The overall effect is that a Rammak has
constant almost all-round vision which lacks detail and
can focus on a specific target at need.

Rammak are egg-layers, typically producing 2–4
eggs at a time. Infants are tiny when hatched and
take nearly 20 standard years to reach maturity. They
are raised communally, without a family bond to the
parents. A segment of Rammak society is dedicated
to the care and education of young, forming the core
of each community. The Rammak have multiple words
for these groups, apparently with different nuances,
but humans have simply applied the term ‘nests’ no
matter how inaccurate it may be. Rammak are willing
to accept losses in a conflict without bad blood but an
attack on a nest or their traditional burial grounds will
result in lasting enmity.

The Rammak are present on several worlds in Kruse
and possibly beyond. Their expansion seems to have
begun around -200, before which they were confined
to the Rammak system. It appears that an early
interplanetary exploration mission stumbled upon the
wreck of a Rule of Man colony ship, giving the Rammak
a jump drive to study. Their first reverse-engineered
drives enabled crude TL7 ships to reach another star
system at least some of the time. The inevitable losses
were acceptable so long as the nests at home were
safe and the Rammak persevered.

Today, the Rammak have colonies on several worlds,
linked by ships using a more stable and reliable version
of the old [[Terra|Terran]] jump drive. Overall Tech Level is
a high 8, touching upon 9, making Rammak ships
rather inefficient. They suffice because they are all the
Rammak have but they are eager to discover the secrets
of the Enclave’s TL13 drive systems. Trade, extortion
and espionage have all been tried at times and it is
possible that the occasional skirmish between Rammak
ships and an Enclave exploration vessel might not
have been misunderstandings or unintentional territorial
violations after all. It may be that the Rammak have
been trying to obtain a modern Solomani jump drive by
whatever means presented itself.

THE HORDES
The Hordes are not political entities and indeed may
not be sentient at all. They are clouds of space-going
creatures which drift from one system to another in a

dormant state. Once sufficient stellar radiation is being
absorbed, the creatures gradually wake up and head
for the system’s inner worlds. There, the creatures
descend to the surface and consume all organic matter
they can find. A large horde is capable of stripping a
planet of all its life in a matter of years. Once there is
insufficient organic matter to be had, a horde will move
on. It may disperse to various destinations or travel en
masse; the reasons for these behaviours are unknown.

The creatures themselves seem to be crystalline in
composition, perhaps using silicone as a base rather
than carbon. They range in size from a few metres in
length to a kilometre or more, although individuals this
large are rare. Horde members can be quite beautiful,
taking the form of an elongated spindle with irregular
and asymmetric crystal spikes. It has been theorised
that the creatures multiply by breaking off spikes that
have grown large enough. Hordes also radiate energy
in highly unusual wavelengths.

It is thought that the hordes are non-sentient but
capable of rudimentary natural telekinesis. If this is
not their means of locomotion they must be capable of
creating gravitic fields somehow. Samples have been
obtained for analysis but this is a risky business. On-
planet the main danger is the creatures’ feeding ability.
They prefer to embed themselves in soil, leaching
minerals by way of extruded fibres. These create a
wide dead zone around the creature, poisoning the soil
and anyone they touch. Protective clothing and boots
are degraded when moving through a poison zone, and
at least some of the creatures are capable of emitting
a cloud of tiny fragments that can cover a large area.
These will drift on the wind if it suits their purposes but
can manoeuvre for a short time in any direction. Cloud
emission is used to obtain coverage of a wider feeding
area but can also chase down threats or mobile prey.

In space, the creatures can slam into vessels and
may be able to fire their spikes at a target. They can
also buffet a ship with what have been described as
gravity waves or telekinetic pulses. Hordes do not
usually react to vessels, even if they pass quite close,
but they will retaliate if threatened and are not reliably
passive at other time. Horde members may change
direction suddenly, congregate around an intruder
or simply attack for unknown reasons. The apparent
randomness of this behaviour is thought by some to
be an indicator of intelligence – dumb animals tend to
be predictable whilst orneryness for its own sake is a
trait of the more intelligent species.

###### Kruse

The Adams subsector is characterised by sparse star
systems towards its coreward end. The coreward-
trailing corner is considered to be part of the Hoydell
Chaos, a region of spacetime anomalies displaying
the characteristics of both a reef and a shoal. Transits
through the Chaos are characterised by a higher than
average incidence of misjumps, with some jumps
taking up to twice as long as normal. No pattern has yet
been discerned to these phenomena.

Most traffic headed towards Forward Base Kruse
avoids the Adams subsector entirely. Expeditions have
been launched to all worlds here, some of them very
long ago. In most cases the basic characteristics of the
mainworld are known but some of this data is partial.
The subsector has several planets capable of bearing
life. At least some of them will have local ecosystems
and sentient species are always a possibility. There are
no know starfaring aliens in the subsector.

HOYDELL’S GATE
Hoydell’s Gate is named for an installation orbiting
its innermost gas giant. The mainworld, if it can be
considered such, is a corrosive hell-world known
informally as Badday. There is a small research outpost

on Badday, staffed by just under 200 personnel. It is
entirely dependent on support from ‘The Gate’ – the
colloquial name for the orbital installation. However, this
is not the main function of the facility.

The Gate is a marshalling point for vessels operating in
the subsector and launching expeditions into the Chaos
region. It also houses an observatory and associated
scientific facilities. At any given time there may be one
or more science vessels or supply ships in-system,
along with fuel shuttles skimming the gas giant, and
hardened cargo craft moving to and from Badday.
These are maintained at The Gate after every run and
supposedly retired as soon as they begin to deteriorate.
In practice, rather than being moved to less hazardous
work the craft are usually refurbished and sent back
out, until eventually they have to be completely retired.
This practice solves short-term problems but creates
longer-term ones and may eventually force the Badday
installation to be abandoned.

HOYDELL’S WATCHTOWER
Hoydell’s Watchtower is located within the fringe of
Hoydell’s Chaos, three parsecs from the nearest safe
port. An outpost has been set up on the mainworld to

support research into astrographic conditions within
the Chaos. For the most part this involves collecting
data using orbital radio telescopes and similar passive
operations, but ships are sometimes sent deeper
into the Chaos. These usually stage through the
Watchtower installation, receiving the latest available
data on local conditions.

At any given time there will be search-and-rescue
vessels landed at the outpost, crewed by people
who have one of the most dangerous jobs in Charted
Space. The Chaos search-and-rescue community
view themselves as an elite and not without good
cause. It is not unusual for someone to be offered a
big salary after a stint at ‘The Tower’, only to return
a few years later. Casualty rates are higher than
average for such work but within tolerable limits.

Research ships typically arrive via Hoydell’s Gate,
reprovisioning at the station there before plunging
into the Chaos. Most return with tales of mild to
moderate difficulties but ships have been lost and
others report being stuck in jumpspace for an
extended period. Fuel and provisions for an extended
mission are always carried, which necessitates
expensive and otherwise inefficient vessels. These
are constructed in the Lubbock Enclave and do not
always reach the Kruse region on schedule. It is not
uncommon for ships to be co-opted by a long-range
expedition or retained in Lubbock ‘on a temporary
basis’ to deal with some pressing need.

BARRATT SUBSECTOR

Kruse

B

The coreward end of the Barratt subsector is within
Hoydell’s Chaos and some systems in the rimward end
are affected from time–to–time. As a result, exploration
has been minimal. The research station at Sometimes
is producing a great deal of data about the effects
of the Chaos but these are as confusing as they are
informative. There is no direct correlation between
the presence of interstellar gas or even measurable
radiation and the effects of the Chaos on jumpspace.

Some scientists have likened the effects to waves along a
rocky seashore, with ripples interacting with one another
to create peaks and troughs. Perhaps if a pattern can
be identified predictions can be made about when and
where it is safe to jump. At present, however, the effects
seem to be random. It may be that there is no interaction
or connection between conditions within the Chaos. If
this is the case its mysteries will never be unravelled
and the whole area might be best left alone. The debate
as to whether to reassign resources somewhere less
dangerous has been raging for decades.

Barnett 0404 is known to have sentient life present. The
lack of industrial pollutants in its atmosphere suggests
a low-tech society, estimated at TL1 in capability.
Contact has been made, and some observations
undertaken, but given the location of the world within
the Chaos it has not been possible to study the
inhabitants in any detail.

SOMETIMES
Sometimes is named for the fact that it is sometimes
within the Chaos. This is shorthand for a complex
situation whereby the incidence of spacetime
anomalies is just on the border between common
enough to be considered part of the Chaos and not.
Reef and shoal incidences are uncommon in the
system but occur sufficiently often to be studied in
relative safety. A number of old ships, mostly small,
are engaged in frequent in-system jumps to study the
variance encountered.

Missions are also launched to the nearest worlds within
the Chaos – Borderline, Always and Densitometer.
Borderline is named for its habitability rather
than position, whilst Always is a reference to the
incidence of anomalies which places it always in
the Chaos. Densitometer is also an ‘always’ system
but is additionally notable for its extremely large
concentrations of heavy elements. The world attracted
increased attention when it was postulated its density
or composition might be connected with the Chaos
phenomenon. However, further investigation suggests
no obvious connection.

###### Barratt Subsector

The Chase subsector lies almost entirely within the
Chaos. Unlike other ‘Chaos Border’ subsectors it has
a fairly populous world close to the edge of the Chaos.
Had the founders of the Kruse Enclave realised how
difficult it would be to develop this system they might
have passed up the opportunity, but once significant
investment had been made it seemed that something
ought to be done with it. The end result was a semi-
independent Solomani colony which is developing into
a small interstellar power.

TROPHY
Trophy was colonised by a mission launched during
the early days of the Rule of Man. Although jump-
capable ships were available, it was decided to make
use of a partially built sublight vessel dating from the
Interstellar Wars period. The colonists passed through

the Chaos without noticing. Like many such missions,
the vessel used was a hollowed-out asteroid, operated
by a skeleton crew in rotation such that the voyage took
around 30 years by the standards of most colonists.
There was never any intent to stop at the far end;
instead the vessel made course changes to pass close
to potentially suitable systems and, when one was
found, was abandoned. Deceleration of the landing
vessels, even with gravity assist from the star, was a
dangerous and lengthy process and inevitably some
of the landers were damaged or lost. Seven made it to
the surface, each carrying a few thousand people and
enough supplies to found a small city.

Some of the damaged craft were eventually salvaged
for equipment their long-dead occupants no longer
required, but beyond this the colonists had to work
with what they could find or extract. Trophy was a

TRAVELLER

hospitable world with abundant resources but even
so the colonists faced an uphill struggle. Machinery
from the landing ships formed the centre of the first
cities, which slowly expanded until some were strong
enough to assist others.

By the time the Kruse Enclave was established,
Trophy was home to a stable TL8 society. Some
items from higher Tech Levels were available,
notably artificial gravity for spacecraft and their
drives. Although rather bulky and clumsy, these were
sufficient to permit exploration of the star system and
the creation of settlements on its various bodies. The
possibility of a sublight expedition to one of the nearby
stars was raised just before contact with the Enclave
made it a moot point.

Although centuries separated their cultures, the two
groups recognised one another as kin and began
an enthusiastic exchange of ideas. The people
of Trophy received technological assistance and
began moving towards membership of the Enclave.
However, missions to Trophy were long and subject
to occasional interference from the Chaos. The
wisdom of pumping resources into a semi-foreign
colony rather than developing the Enclave’s worlds
was questioned again and again, and gradually the
uplift programme petered out.

Trophy was left more or less to its own devices,
eventually developing a TL9 technological base
with its own jump-capable starships. These need to
carry fuel for two jumps and operating close to the
Chaos makes any trip a little perilous. Nevertheless,
Trophy has set up communities on Velvet, Mosaic
and Discovery. There is also a major asteroid mining
installation in the Emblem system despite the effects
of the Chaos. These worlds are all seen as extensions
or possessions of Trophy itself, which does not
style itself as an interstellar federation or multi-world
state. Instead, its leaders have taken to using the
terms ‘Second Imperium’ or ‘Rule of Man’ in formal
communications. Technically there is some basis for
this, as the original colony mission never relinquished
its loyalty to the Rule of Man. The Enclave views this
affectation as potentially worrying but mostly a bit silly.
Relations remain cordial, if increasingly distant.

Trophy, and its tiny Imperium, intends to expand further.
There is plenty of unclaimed space so this will not
cause friction or even attract much interest from the
Enclave. However, there are rumours that astrogators
from Trophy have created a technique whereby they
can not only avoid the most dangerous spacetime
anomalies but somehow use them to enhance jump
drive performance within the Chaos. It seems likely
this is mis-reporting of a fluke or simple propaganda,
but if not the ‘Rule of Man’ may be able to colonise the
worlds of Hoydell’s Chaos and thereby gain protection
against all other starfaring powers.

DROWER SUBSECTOR

Kruse

D

The Drower subsector is influenced by the Chaos but
is for the most part clear of its effects. Astrographically,
its one-parsec cluster – known as the Drower Cluster

- is the most important feature. Even with long-

range exploration ships, the convenience of a cluster
inevitably focuses attention there. The worlds within the
Chaos to coreward have thus far not received much
attention, whilst the ecosystems of the Drower Cluster
have been studied in some detail.

None of the worlds in this subsector have been
colonised by the Kruse Enclave, although there is
a small support base at Kinsissi. This installation
primarily serves as a stopover for research vessels
headed for OutReach. Trophy is known to be
interested in the cluster as an easy route to greater
territory. Its ships have visited several worlds in
recent years, although there does not appear to have
been any effort to colonise.

KINSISSI
Kinsissi is the site of Research Base Drower, a multi-part
facility dedicated to supporting operations into OutReach
and RimReach. The presence of a parasitic life form
capable of taking over an intelligent host is considered to
be an extreme threat, worthy of the utmost caution. For
this reason there are three orbital facilities. Station Alpha
never receives vessels that have been in OutReach
or RimReach; it is dedicated to supporting expeditions
within the subsector and receiving supply shipments
from the centre of the Enclave.

Station Beta supports missions into RimReach and
OutReach and has heavy quarantine procedures.
Station Gamma acts as a backup for Beta and
sometimes supports operations to trailingward.
However, entry into Flous Nebula is normally made
elsewhere. The surface installation exists mainly to
provide foodstuffs to the orbital facilities and exploration
ships. It is not considered a colony as such, although in
time it may grow to become one.

###### drower Subsector

The coreward end of the Eberhardt subsector is
largely empty and the presence of a convenient main
has directed efforts into the systems upon it. The
whole of the subsector has been at least cursorily
explored and a small interstellar polity has been
established. This began as a privately-contracted
expedition to set up a support base on the Eberhardt
Main, providing security and assistance to ships
headed for the Kruse Enclave. However, bases need
industry and industry needs resources... and all

of that requires people. The base became a semi-
independent world with its own government and that
government began taking control of other worlds.

The ‘Eberhardt landgrab’, as it is known, has been
condemned by the central administration of the
Enclave but it has always been accompanied by loud
protestations of loyalty and generous donations of
resources. This is barely-charted space and whilst
it might be reasonable to object to a foreign power

TRAVELLER

annexing territory on an important supply route, it is
something quite different when a corporation from ‘back
home’ takes over several worlds in the name of the
Confederation and provides active support.

The new polity styles itself the Eberhardt Corporate
Republic, with its headquarters and seat of
governance on Eberhardt itself. The landgrab has
been characterised by small settlements which were
intended to be built up quickly. However, the temptation
to seed another planet rather than investing in those
already held has created a number of problems. Some
settlements have broken away, usually citing a lack of
support, creating a patchwork of small towns across
a planet’s surface with no central government. These
cannot support their technological base and are having
to resort to mid-tech expedients.

Other settlements were left without support for too
long but remained loyal. These are now receiving
urgent aid which absorbs much of the ECR’s
available resources. The world of Nonchalance is
an exception. Independence from the ECR was
declared, accompanied by protestations of loyalty to
the Confederation as a whole and backed up by a
force of improvised gunships. As the first and most
developed of the colonies, Nonchalance represents
the greatest investment and the most prestige,
so an effort was made to reabsorb it. After a few
skirmishes in space, the situation settled down
into a cold war. The Kruse Enclave has steadfastly
refused to take a side.

Nonchalance has begun building armed low-jump trade
ships for use in the Eberhardt Main and is apparently
trying to win over some of the independent settlements.
The scale of this activity is very small compared to the
grand politics of the Confederation but in a region as
sparsely populated as Kruse sector it may become
significant in the long term.

EBERHARDT PRIME
Eberhardt Prime is a lush, watery world chosen
for its ability to feed a colony rather than planetary
industrial resources. Its cities are mostly built on
the coasts of large islands, connected by advanced
maritime vessels and submersibles. There is
sufficient arable land to support industrial-scale
agriculture but aquaculture is the primary source of
food. The colony has a modest industrial base in its
cities but most heavy industry is in orbit.

Eberhardt Prime was colonised specifically to be a way
post for ships entering the sector along the Rimward
Corridor from Lubbock and continues to fulfil that
function. It was never intended to be an exploration
base. Instead, its astrogators rely on data provided by
the Enclave’s exploration missions and concentrate
on the development of local colonies. This was not the
intended mission, either, and has not been conducted
in a coherent or efficient manner.

The Eberhardt Corporate Republic has its headquarters
at the orbital starport, which also houses its modest
shipyards and high-tech manufacturing facilities.
Planetary cities and settlements in other systems
are run as corporate subsidiaries, with a measure of
democratic input from the populace. Quality of life
is high, in terms of leisure time and access to luxury
goods, and the populace of the mainworld are generally
content. The colonies are a different story, however.
Nonchalance is in open rebellion – its leaders would
phrase that as ‘has already achieved independence’ –
and other neglected settlements may follow suit.

For many years the ECR has concentrated on central
economic development supported by mobile mining
operations, with colonial operations taking place on a
shoestring budget. The risk of losing the colonies or,
worse, seeing them join Nonchalance, has prompted
a change in policy. Wars of reconquest, however
small, are likely to be less effective and more
expensive than pumping money into the colonies.
Families from Prime are offered generous grants to
resettle in the colonies, which are receiving long-
overdue investment. This is happening rather late
in the day, however, with some colonies having little
functional high-tech equipment left.

The ECR likes to style itself as an interstellar state but
in reality it is a corporate body based at one orbital
station, with major holdings on one planet and a few
minor local franchises. Its primary assets are in space,
aboard either the orbital port or its fleet of mining
ships. One recent venture is a jump-capable mining/
manufacturing platform intended to build and place
everything from navigational beacons to planetside
installations, all using locally sourced materials. The
vessel was funded by the Kruse Enclave and will be
operated on its behalf subject to a rather complex
contract. It remains to be seen whether the ECR will
entirely honour the deal.

###### Eberhardt Subsector

NONCHALANCE
Nonchalance was chosen as the first ECR colony
for its abundance of resources on-planet and in-
system. It is less welcoming than other worlds on the
main and was always intended to be a possession
of Eberhardt Prime. After a period of heavy initial
investment the ECR largely ignored the mainworld,
building a small but high-quality port in orbit to serve
asteroid mining operations and any passing ships
that required assistance. Eventually tiring of having
responsibilities but few rights, the populace made
representations to the central ECR government
and were entirely ignored. At this point, a cadre
of hardliners emerged to lead an independence
movement that went straight from protesting ill-
treatment to planning revolution.

To ECR observers, the Nonchalance problem began
to die down. There was a little unrest but no threat was
perceived. It was assumed that the populace would
accept their place sooner or later, or could be brought
around with some minor investment. Under cover of
this situation, the people of Nonchalance laid their
plans and when the time was right they struck.

The revolution was almost bloodless. The orbital port
was seized in a matter of hours and several craft
were seized. A jump-capable mining platform was
also taken, although others escaped. The non-jump-
capable elements of the mining fleet were forced to
surrender and within days the first of them had been
converted into crude combat vessels. The ECR had

no real warships but quickly threw together a flotilla
of armed craft whilst demanding assistance from the
Enclave government. This was not provided, largely
because diplomats from Nonchalance had already
made its case for independence as a member world of
the Confederation and the Kruse Enclave.

The arrival of ECR space forces in-system was
something of an anti-climax. Demands and counter-
demands flew back and forth, and a few missiles
were exchanged. Nothing decisive was achieved
and neither side wanted to press for a decisive clash
they might not win. After this, the ECR switched to a
policy of harassing Nonchalance’s mining ships and
deploying its own with an improvised escort. This
continues to the present day with the occasional raid
or skirmish. The natural resources of the Nonchalance
system are not so great that the ECR could not take
its operations elsewhere but doing so would be
tantamount to admitting defeat.

The power of Nonchalance has grown steadily but
slowly since the revolution. Its hard-line government
remains popular, especially since ships from the
Kruse Enclave have begun trading goods for raw
resources at the highport. Both factions continue to
play politics at the Enclave capital and there is no
sign of an accord. The ECR wants its territory back
and to put the current Nonchalance leaders on trial,
who have no interest in letting that happen. The
survival of Nonchalance as an independent state
depends on being more trouble to reconquer than it
is worth, and so far that plan has succeeded.

###### Eberhardt Subsector

This subsector was chosen as the location for
Forward Base Kruse and therefore the Kruse Enclave,
mainly due to the presence of a convenient cluster
in the centre of the subsector. Creating a ‘sanitised’
area with a clear boundary – if necessary by removing
threats by force – was desirable as a security
measure. The presence of a two or more parsec
break around the Enclave was no barrier to its vessels
but could help keep any lower-tech local starfaring
civilisations out. It also ensured the boundaries of
Solomani territory were clear, which could have
diplomatic benefits in the future.

# F RENCH SUBSECTOR

The central cluster is considered the territory of the
Solomani Confederation and its local enclave, and
therefore home turf whilst the rest of the cluster
is at best semi-charted space. The Enclave has
constructed a number of transport vessels to operate
exclusively in the cluster. These ships plod around
the cluster on a regular schedule, keeping member
worlds in contact and ensuring an urgent personnel
movement does not require a more capable vessel to
be pulled off its intended mission.

TRAVELLER

With the exception of Karkazis, the worlds of the
Enclave are not hospitable. That might pose a
problem if the intent was to colonise the region but
so long as the forward base is kept supplied with
food and raw materials it can serve its function.
Settlements on the other worlds are in part ‘territorial
anchors’ and in part long-term projects to study the
worlds in detail. If colonisation goes ahead at some
point in the future, suitable worlds will be selected
elsewhere in the sector.

KARKAZIS
Karkazis is the breadbasket for the Kruse installation. It
was colonised before Kruse itself began construction,
with contingents of colonists shipped in throughout the
800s. A young world with a basic ecosystem, Karkazis
was quickly transformed into a neo-Terra by the
introduction of species common on Solomani worlds.
As a result, little of the original flora and fauna survive.

The population mostly dwell in small cities of around
250,000 or so people. There is some local industry
but the majority are employed in food production or
related industries. Quality of life is very high, with
advanced robots handling the heavy work, and
most people are well educated. All the same, life on
Karkazis is a little humdrum. This makes offworld
work attractive, so every year thousands of young
hopefuls apply for training contracts in space-based
industries or compete for a place at the University of
Kruse. Those that do well join the exploration effort or
its supporting industries. The remainder return to the
farms of Karkazis or take jobs with one of the private
concerns operating out of the forward base.

Life here can be a little one-dimensional and
successive generations have sought an alternative
outlet for their energies. At times this has become
destructive but rather than repeatedly crushing
dissident movements SolSec chose to take a more
subtle approach. Art and music programmes helped
divert those who were becoming disaffected or who
had become burned out from too much important
scientific work. Somehow this got out of hand, with
rival art movements and dance styles competing in
an increasingly belligerent manner. These rivalries
are for the most part non-violent but they are bitter

and divisive. There is no obvious solution and at the
present time a significant proportion of the prison
population are in for embarrassing offences such
as civil disobedience resulting from a difference of
opinion about a new work of art.

KRUSE PRIME
The Kruse system is named, like many astrographic
features in the region, for a prominent [[Terra|Terran]]
anthropologist. There is no mainworld as such in this
system; instead the main population centre is a large
installation orbiting the system’s innermost gas giant.
Forward Base Kruse is unofficially known simply as
‘Kruse’ and is equivalent to a large Class A starport.
This installation contains the administrative centre for
the system and its surrounding area, and is also the
social heart of the system-wide community.

Two other large stations orbit the gas giant. One is
a repair and maintenance works for the extensive
exploration and support fleet, the other is the
headquarters and primary base for the small naval
force assigned to the system. A small shipyard
produces new vessels at a slow rate but most new craft
are sent up from the base in the Lubbock sector.

There are several other communities in the system,
located on moons and rockball planets. These include
mining and industrial centres, scientific installations
and specialist facilities. The system has its own
small penal colony, university and specialist medical
institutions geared to the needs of people who may
spend years at a time cooped up in a small exploration
vessel. The many scattered outposts and settlements
are connected by a network of in-system transports,
including many repurposed scout/couriers whose jump
drives have degraded too much for safe use.

The system government officially answers directly
to the Secretariat of the Solomani Party, but as they
are many months away by fast ship the appointed
governor has more or less complete power. An advisory
assembly handles most routine decision-making
and includes representatives of SolSec whose remit
permits the removal and replacement of a governor. In
practice, officials are sufficiently well chosen that the
forward base and its supporting communities operate in
harmony most of the time.

###### French Subsector

Gower contains a handful of inhabited worlds. All
known populations are humans descended from
early colony missions. These worlds were isolated
for centuries and have all regressed to a greater
or lesser degree. Not all have been contacted; in
some cases it was deemed more useful to observe
covertly before attempting any sort of approach. The

reason for the naming theme throughout the sector

- every subsector is named after a female [[Terra|Terran]]

anthropologist from the pre-starflight era.

The primary astrographic feature of the subsector
is known as the Gower Crescent. A main of nine
star systems with easy jump-2 access to almost
the whole subsector, this was an obvious target
for the early colonisation missions. Colonies were

Kruse

G

established in several systems on or close to the
crescent, although not all of them survived. This is
one of the more thoroughly explored areas of the
sector, lying as it does close to the Enclave and on
the easiest route to trailingward.

MANNYWEN
The colony on Mannywen did better than most others,
despite having to contend with a tainted atmosphere,
severe volcanism and contamination of the soil. Large
areas of the planet are considered uninhabitable,
with the population concentrated into several widely
dispersed city-states. Contact was made many years
ago and relations are overwhelmingly friendly. Some
of the city-states have asked to be incorporated
into the Enclave but since this would be a drain on
resources their overtures have been politely declined.
However, a diplomatic mission was sent to Home
itself to ask for recognition as a world of the Solomani
Confederation and the support that would surely bring.
How a party from Mannywen will fare in a modern
starfaring state is an open question.

NASCA
The human population on Nasca have not been
contacted. Their own name for their world is unknown
and the one assigned is a supposedly humorous

reference to the fact that the inhabitants have
only been observed from above. It is obvious the
population are descended from [[Terra|Terran]] colonists and
their landing site has even been identified. ‘Landing’
might be too grand a word for it; remote sensor data
suggests the colony ship crash-landed in a region
of shallow rivers and marsh and was decisively
wrecked. The boggy local conditions may have been
chosen to soften an otherwise lethal impact but will
also have made access to the ship difficult. There are
no settlements nearby, so perhaps the region has
become taboo or been forgotten.

The population is estimated to be around 50 million,
most of whom dwell on a single continent in small
proto-nations or tribal groupings. There are a few
overseas settlements, linked by ocean-going sailing
vessels. It is not clear if memories remain of the
interstellar voyage or the existence of humans
elsewhere in the universe, but it is likely that some form
of records were retained unless there was a deliberate
suppression. Even in that case, the fragmented nature
of society on Nasca would make it difficult to completely
expunge all information on the subject. If this is the
case, contact should not be damaging to the Nascans.
However, it is not a priority and in the meantime the
anthropologists are glad of the opportunity to study low-
tech humans ‘in the wild’, as it were.

HAGAN SUBSECTOR

Kruse

TRAVELLER

The Hagan subsector is characterised by a cluster of
10 star systems, with a two-parsec route to all others.
This would make it a prime target for colonisation, if
the Confederation so chose, but for the fact that some
worlds are already claimed. The polity now known as
the Interstellar Republic was confined to Promise for
many centuries but was already building an interstellar
state when the Kruse Enclave was set up in the French
subsector. Its ships are rather primitive, requiring two
jumps to travel out of the Promise Cluster. Naturally,
this has focused attention within the cluster, other than
some attempts at trade missions to the Enclave.

PROMISE
Promise is the homeworld of the Interstellar Republic
and for many decades was its only possession.
After regressing all the way to TL4, Promise made
a slow but carefully managed resurgence. Its jump
drive technology is its own, carefully preserved since
the days of the Rule of Man-era colony mission.
Promise has the knowledge necessary to build jump-
2 ships despite its overall Tech Level being a low 9.
However, this would require risky prototyping and
finding ways to replicate TL11 components. Risk-
averse Promise prefers to construct its proven two-
jump-2 vessels for the time being.

Negotiations are ongoing with the Enclave for
technological assistance, including help with the
jump-2 drive. In return, the Interstellar Republic will
provide access to its technological vaults. These
contain information dating all the way back to the
Second Imperium. Whilst the Solomani Confederation
has developed far beyond that point, the data is still
of interest. There may be small insights here and
there but what is more important is what can be read
between the lines. The data alone is not sufficient to
justify giving technology to a foreign state but actual
records from the Rule of Man might be.

SHACKLEY
Shackley is an Enclave outpost-colony, situated
close to the coreward-trailing corner of the sector
as a staging post for missions into Darkly Veiled
and Ruthless Veil. The planetary population of
around 300,000 were assigned to support the orbital
installation, which is equivalent in most ways to a Class
B starport. Supply and development missions normally
stage through Liar’s Belt in the Promise Cluster
and increasingly the Kruse Enclave has bought raw
materials intended for Shackley there.

The Interstellar Republic maintains a diplomatic
mission at Shackley and sometimes arranges
personnel exchanges. These tend to be, at first glance,
a little one-sided. The Enclave gets dozens of workers
in return for one or two liaison officers or expert
advisors. However, the Republic benefits in terms of
technological and technique advancement whilst the
Enclave has more hands to get things done.

IVY SUBSECTOR

I

The primary astrographic feature in Ivy is known to
humans as the Endelli Chain, after the first captain
to explore a significant section of it. The proximity
of these worlds allowed a non-human civilisation
known as the Rammak to expand out of their home
system when they discovered a working jump drive
aboard a derelict Solomani colony ship. They are
not excessively territorial but will sometimes harass
Enclave starships for no apparent reason. The
Rammak have occasionally had some conflict with
the Sovereignty but they can surely tell the difference
between their ships and those of the Enclave. It is
probable they are looking for an opportunity to seize
an Enclave ship so they can study its jump drive.

There are no known human populations in the
subsector. Any indication of people being present
refers to Rammak, although there may be minor
species as yet undiscovered.

RAMMAK CLAIM
The rockball mainworld at 0807 is of little value except
that it lies one parsec from the Rammak homeworld.
It is thought that this was the destination of their first
interstellar mission and that the system holds symbolic
significance. A small garrison or staff of just a few
hundred are stationed at the outpost, which shows
signs of intermittent extension and improvement. The
Rammak do not seem interested in the rest of the
mainworld and there appears to be no exploitation of,
or even exploration for, resources.

Rammak ships out of the homeworld routinely head
trailingward into the Jain subsector, generally following
a clearly established route. They are known to loiter
in certain systems in a predictable manner, perhaps
waiting for a rendezvous. It is not clear who or what
is expected but ships from the Enclave have met a
mixed response at these locations. Sometimes the
Rammak seem quite eager for contact but on other
occasions their vessels have attempted to harass
Enclave ships. This is a little laughable, as clumsy TL8
contraptions attempt to get a little too close to modern
starships in the hope of intimidating their crews, or
whatever else the Rammak have in mind.

This harassment is apparently random elsewhere
but any Enclave vessel entering the 0807 system
is certain to encounter such belligerence – which is
oddly absent in the home system. There is clearly
something about 0807 the Rammak care about and
do not want others to see, and so far they have been
successful in keeping their secret. This is more about
the Enclave having too much else to do than any
fear of repercussions. In all likelihood, the Enclave’s
leadership will use a harassment incident as a pretext
and go in to find out... sooner or later.

RAMMAK HOME
Humans can only approximate the words said by the
Rammak and many of them do not translate very
well. The label ‘Rammak Home’ was applied by the
Enclave as an approximate translation of a difficult-
to-pronounce and very long string of words. The
world itself is habitable by humans, which creates
a possible bone of contention if the Confederation
decides to colonise the sector and the Rammak gain
in power. This is one reason why keeping advanced
jump drives out of the hands of the Rammak is seen
as critically important. Current projections suggest
that they will be confined to the Endelli Chain for
the next century. Their ships may range further but
only with great difficulty and colony missions will be
extremely difficult to mount even over local distances
until reliable TL9 vessels are developed.

Population figures are a very rough estimate based
upon fleeting observations and in truth humans
do not really understand how the Rammak govern
themselves. Ships come to the homeworld from
colonies carrying what appear to be diplomatic parties
and apparently unnecessary or unprofitable goods
are moved around for unknown reasons. There
are unconfirmed reports that shiploads of corpses
are brought home from the colonies, suggesting
a religious need to be interred in the soil of the
homeworld. The introduction of species from Rammak
Home to the colonies takes on a different significance
in this light – perhaps the Rammak are creating burial
grounds on their new worlds?

RAMMAK TRAVELLERS
Rammak Travellers generate their characteristics
in a similar manner to humans, with the following
considerations.
•	 DEX is rolled as 1D+8, giving a starting range of
9–14
•	 SOC indicates the Rammak’s ability to navigate
its own species’ social conventions and achieve
high status. Outside their own society, status
depends on political relations and the amount
of respect an outsider is willing to give. This will
vary greatly depending on circumstances.

TRAITS
Rammak Travellers possess the following traits:

ALL-ROUND PERCEPTION
The secondary eyes of a Rammak are designed
to warn them of danger from the sides and rear,
and provide all-round situational awareness.
DM+2 applies to situations in which a Rammak
must move through a cluttered area, providing
there is at least a little light or surrounding
objects have a temperature differential great
enough to be discerned. Anyone trying
to sneak up on a Rammak or otherwise
physically surprise them suffers DM-2.

SPECIALISED LIMBS
The limbs of a Rammak are well adapted to
climbing, reaching into awkward spaces and similar
actions. DM+2 applies to checks in all such situations.
However, they are not as capable of delivering raw
strength as the limbs of humans. When engaged in
strength-based actions, such as wrestling or trying to
drag a heavy object, DM-2 applies.

###### Ivy Subsector

It is not clear what designations the Rammak
use for their starships but the most commonly
encountered design appears to be an all-purpose
transport capable of making multiple jumps. Most
structural components and non-essential systems
are constructed at TL8, with flight systems at TL9.
A jump-2 capable drive is installed, although it is
bulkier than those used by other civilisations.

The drive is based on one reverse-engineered
from a wrecked Solomani ship and tinkered with
until it could reliably initiate a two-parsec jump.
It is not known whether these drives produce a
higher misjump rate than conventional ones, but
they must be reliable enough that long-distance
interstellar travel is routine. Similarly, some other
systems are based on more advanced versions the
Rammak encountered. This makes the vessel’s
cost at best an estimate.

Hull form is rather peculiar and may be based on
the Rammak’s own physiology. A central body,
roughly in the shape of a flattened cylinder, houses
the power, command and life-support systems
whilst four egg-shaped ‘limbs’ carry the drive
systems and related equipment. The rear limbs are
slightly larger than the forward ones, with jump and
manoeuvre drive components distributed between
all four. Each limb has its own power plant capable
of supporting the drives plus some additional
functions and a small control area.

The main hull has two power plants, located fore
and aft, which provide sufficient power for general
functions. This is inefficient in terms of command
and operation, and presumably maintenance is also
affected, but it does make the system resilient in
terms of component failure and damage control. It
has been estimated that a Rammak ship might lose
up to 20% of its jump or manoeuvre drive system
without performance being affected. It may be
possible to use the remaining parts of a damaged
drive with some clever command work, in which
case the performance-degradation threshold may be
as high as 40%. If at some point the Rammak learn
to optimise their drives this margin might be reduced
or eliminated in favour of efficiency.

Their ships are designed to be capable of making
a planetary landing, with a framework of supports
and light armour panels to increase hull rigidity. They
are rather clumsy, requiring coordination between
the central command area and four pilots, each
operating a drive system. Control can be centralised
at need, or transferred to any one of the pilots, but the
requirement to constantly adjust each of four separate
systems makes this even more clumsy. DM-2 applies
to all Pilot checks made by a single pilot, whereas no
DM applies if four local pilots and their assistants are
in place to fine-tune the drives as commands arrive
from the primary pilot on the bridge.

Rammak ships are typically armed with relatively
low-tech missile launchers, although on some
vessels the bays appear to have been replaced
with other machinery. One notable feature is a
large area devoted to living spaces for the crews.
Actual accommodation takes the form of clusters of
cubicle-like sleeping areas but between them are
what appear to be multi-environment spaces set up
to duplicate homeworld conditions. It is not clear if
these areas house machinery or are there to allow
off-duty Rammak to frolic in the pseudo-forest.
Perhaps they have some entirely different function.

Crewing requirements are a mystery. It appears
that a typical 4,000 ton vessel carries about 80
Rammak, most of whom are trained in the basics
of power plant operations. The power systems
of a ship have a particular reverence among
their crews, whilst the jump drive is apparently
considered to be just a thing that does a job. This
may be due to the fact the drive was obtained
outside Rammak society whilst the power plant
is their own, or perhaps some incident in the past
is remembered with fear and veneration. The
command and control system appears to be mostly
cooperative rather than hierarchical but details are
not known. Similarly, Rammak ships may have a
few surprises hidden deep in their hulls. In time,
Solomani spacers will learn all about these rather
rickety vessels but for now they are one of the
mysteries of the Rim.

Jain is rather sparse, with a modest-sized rift in
its rimward-trailing corner. The only significant
astrographical feature is the trailing end of the
Endelli Chain, which stretches into Ivy and is partially
controlled by the Rammak. There are no known
Rammak colonies in this subsector; all populations
are the remnants of human colonisation efforts during
the Rule of Man era.

The sparsity of systems in Jain has severely limited
the ability of the Rammak to explore the subsector,
although they are known to have made multi-jump
crossings to trailing and rimward. For unknown
reasons, a Rammak ship can almost always be
encountered in Jain 0503. These vessels loiter for
months without conducting any sort of exploration or
even moving around the system. No surface activity

has been detected, either. It may be that the Rammak
station a vessel here for diplomatic purposes, expecting
ships from the Enclave to come through from time–
to–time. Unlike other systems, there have been no
harassment incidents to date.

CENTTI
Of the three known [[Terra|Terran]] colonies in Jain, two crashed
all the way back to barbarism. Centti did not, although it
got most of the way before stabilising and beginning a
recovery. Today, the world is divided into small nation-
states, most possessing TL6 technology, with others
at the late TL5 level. Open contact has been made but
the situation is complicated by antagonism between
some of the states. In most cases the origins of these
conflicts have long been forgotten, although there is
always someone who can cite specific incidents.

The wreckage of the original colony ship has been
identified by Enclave explorers. The locals seem
unaware of it, since it lies in a remote area of thick
forest. This has permitted scientists to discreetly
excavate a route into the wreckage and begin an
investigation. The project is slow going, as discovery
by any of the local powers might trigger a shooting
war. It is not possible to say for certain but some of
the local powers might consider possession of the
original landing site to be politically important, or
believe there are treasures to be found in the wreck.
Either way, once someone makes a grab for the site
others will try to take it from them. There is also the
possibility that the Rammak or some other power
might try to seize the wreck site in the hope of finding
reverse-engineerable jump drive components.

The colony ship has been buried by centuries of soil
deposition and forest growth but it seems that after
a rather rough landing it was for a time the centre of
a community. Foundations of structures have been
discovered, suggesting some form of town or city was
built and powered from the ship’s reactor. This was
the ‘base camp’ from which the world was colonised
and it seems that some advanced technology was
retained long enough to spread colonists widely
over the planetary surface. After that, the colonies
regressed to TL5 or lower, retaining only the vaguest
records of their arrival on-planet.

ENDELLI’S GRAVE
Endelli’s grave is a habitable world which clearly merited
extensive surface exploration during Captain Lindya
Endelli’s expedition to the chain of worlds that now bear
her name. After studying the ecosystems of several
worlds and locating two regressed human colonies,
Endelli made peaceful contact with the Rammak and
deduced they had inherited their jump drive from a lost
[[Terra|Terran]] colony ship. Due to return a hero, Endelli decided
to take another look at the rampant life of the world now
known for being her resting place.

Endelli’s Grave has a vigorous ecosystem, to say
the least, with fast-breeding animals predated by an
array of lethal creatures. It was here, in some corner
of a forgotten forest, that she died trying to rescue
members of the expedition who had strayed too far.
Her body was never found and when news finally
reached Home of her fall a day of national mourning
was declared. Captain Endelli was enshrined as a Hero
of the Confederation and her lost grave is recognised
as [[Terra|Terran]] soil. Naturally, this has made Endelli’s Grave
a desirable prospect for colonisation by those who
like the symbology. Survey missions are constantly
being requested by interested parties but as yet formal
permission for colonisation has not been sought.

Kane contains a scattering of worlds, with no
significant mains or clusters. It was the target for
several colony missions and a rendezvous point for
others that had become lost crossing Hoydell’s Chaos.
In some cases vessels wandered for years before
settling on a suitable place to colonise or running out
of options. Others arrived years after another group
had settled a planet. This led to rival colonies on the
same world in some cases, or attempts to take over.
These were no more effective than the missions that
attempted to assist those who had already arrived.

The pattern all over Kane was one of a rapid collapse
to barbarism. The one exception, Chamboldt, was a
victim of its own success. Over-extension arising from
an attempt to build an empire among the regressed
colonies resulted in civil war and the total destruction
of civilisation. Today, a remnant population survives
as nomadic hunter-gatherers, carefully avoiding
taboo areas that correspond to the original city sites.
Some of these are now radioactive craters; most were
abandoned as civilisation broke down and became
unable to support such large communities.

ISKULENN
Iskulenn has retained a central government but at
the price of implementing a rather nasty religious
dictatorship. Contact has been made, although
explorers wisely choose to tread carefully on this
world of strict and occasionally contradictory laws. For
this reason observers from the Enclave are not really
sure what the people of Iskulenn believe or worship.
Religion is highly organised, to the point where it
is all-pervasive. There is no distinction between
spiritual and secular matters, with worship services
overlapping work and recreation. Rank in the Church
is necessary to hold positions of authority but senior
priests outrank everyone else. This means that a
talented administrator can go so far by showing due
deference to the Church but can be over-ruled by
someone who knows nothing about the issues at hand
but who can claim divine guidance.

The nature of the world religion is obscure to outsiders.
It is thought that devotees worship an ancient being
that dwells on a world somewhere in this region of
space. None of the trappings of the Ancients have been
observed but apart from that little is known about this
‘Preserver’. According to the few legends outsiders
have been able to find out, the ancestors of the people
of Iskulenn wandered lost in the wilderness of space
before the Preserver found them and gave them a
home. Those who venture out without its protection and
guidance risk being lost forever.

REQUARRE
Requarre is typical of the colonies that regressed but
regained some technology. Despite having gone through
difficult times its people remained relatively unified,
emerging as a decentralised republic of city-states. Ties
are loose for the most part, with cities often ignoring
the consensus of others, but this weak framework has
survived where other colonial governments failed. A
mature TL5 society has existed for centuries and is
unlikely to progress without some major realignment
of resources; Requarre is too decentralised to support
anything but glacially slow advancement.

Requarre does not have a starport as such. Like many
similar worlds its people are willing to receive offworld
visitors and to trade with them, but facilities are limited
to whatever a given city can improvise. Likewise, there
is little the world can offer to an interstellar power so
trade is usually on a small scale. This does not prevent
the city-states vying for the attention of an arriving
starship. The clamour of invitations and claims to be the
world’s main port is notorious among those who have
operated in this subsector.

The primary astrographic feature of Luomala is a cluster
of 10 star systems located in the coreward-rimward
corner. These might have been an attractive target for the
establishment of an enclave but for the proximity of the
Flous Nebula. It is possible that early colonial expeditions
were not put off, or ended up having to land on one of the
worlds of the cluster as their drives wore out.

The remainder of the subsector is typical of the region,
with small clumps of systems and no major chains
or groupings. Unusual radio-frequency emissions
emanating from the vicinity of 0707 have thus far
not been identified. They are not associated with the
mainworld and may not be coming from inside the
star system itself. These intermittent emissions were

initially thought to be produced artificially and therefore
a sign of intelligent life, but their characteristics have
changed over time and are now thought to be natural.
The change is characteristic of ‘some kind of decay’;
the signals have become fainter and more ‘fuzzy’ in the
years since they were first detected. Investigation is not
assigned a high priority by the Kruse Enclave.

FORSSEI
The only known human population in the subsector
resides on Forssei. They are something of an enigma,
displaying a great deal of genetic drift away from
the human norm. Indeed, the physical proportions
of these people and their general appearance is
sufficiently different to the rest of the Solomani people
that questions have been raised about their origins.
Normally, when a population is discovered in some far-
off place the Ancients are assumed to be responsible
and this has been postulated. However, there is little
evidence of Ancients activity in the region.

The people of Forssei bear a resemblance to what
humans might have looked and acted like around
40,000 years ago, when [[Terra|Terran]] humans first became
behaviourally modern. They are known to produce
art and have a language, albeit a rather basic one.
Interactions with Solomani explorers have been
overwhelmingly friendly; the people of Forssei do not
need to compete for resources for the most part and
are not particularly territorial. They seem to find the
offworld researchers’ attempts to work stone and make
fire hilarious and are not always polite about it.

However the people of Forssei got there, they are an
opportunity to study a species on the cusp of advanced
sentience, exploring their world with hungry minds.
These people are primitive but they are anything but
stupid. They now know there is a wider and greater
universe than they had believed and are beginning to
create cave art depicting the heavens. This intervention
at such a sensitive stage of development will have
unpredictable results and whilst some scientists may
regret not allowing the people of Forssei to develop
in isolation, the opportunity to observe the effects of
offworld contact is a fascinating one.

FRANKLIN
The mainworld of the otherwise strangely empty 0603
system is a super-earth whose eccentric orbit centres
on the barycentre of a pair of binary gas giants. There

are virtually no other bodies in the system. The world
experiences highly variable conditions, although it is
somewhat insulated by its thick atmosphere of carbon
dioxide and methane. This traps sufficient heat to
prevent the world from freezing at its most distant
point from the star and, despite being at the outer
edge of the system’s ‘warm’ zone, allows liquid water
to exist for most of its long orbital period. Changing
temperature conditions create incredible storms in
between cold periods.

The exotic conditions at 0603 might not, in and of
themselves, be enough to prompt a research project.
However, the world is known to have life of some kind.
Anything that evolved in such an unusual environment
is worth studying, or so the Enclave believes, and a
long-term research project was set up. This initially
met with disaster, when the mobile laboratory vessel
Franklin suffered a drive malfunction and was forced to
crash-land on the surface. Rescue was not possible for
several months, during which the survivors endured a
constant battle to keep parts of the wreck liveable and
fend off encroachments by local creatures.

By the time rescue ships arrived the crew of Franklin had
not only created a defended zone around their ship but
had begun mapping out the world’s complex ecosystem.
Rather than abandon the vessel, it was decided to turn it
into a surface base. The jump drive and other sensitive
components were removed and salvage work was
undertaken on the most wrecked parts. The rest of the
ship was resettled into a more comfortable alignment
and additional structures added. Exploration of the
surface is mostly undertaken by heavy ground vehicles
as wind conditions can be fearsome.

0603 is now known as Franklin in honour of the
science ship and her heroic crew, and whilst the
official permanent population is 100 personnel staff
the improvised base there. Franklin is a dangerous
and arduous posting, and therefore one of the
‘positions of honour’ in the exploration of Kruse. Semi-
regular supply and support missions rotate personnel
and take the data they have gathered back to Kruse
itself. Typically, these missions consist of more than
one ship. A vessel will usually remain in orbit over
Franklin for a few weeks whilst others push on into the
rest of the cluster and through into the Flous Nebula
sector. In between these missions the personnel on
Franklin are on their own.

###### Luomala Subsector

The Mullings subsector is very sparse, with virtually
no worlds in its rimward half. The Mullings Rift
is something of a barrier to exploration in that
direction, requiring deep space refuelling to reach the
isolated worlds or to progress further rimward. Not
surprisingly, expeditions tend to go around the rift.
Heading to trailing means entering territory claimed
by the Sovereignty and whilst this is not a problem
for the Kruse Enclave, this area has been explored
by Sovereignty ships. It is simpler to trade for data
and verify it at leisure than to send expeditions into
the region. As a result of this rift, which extends into
the Mead sector directly to rimward, ships headed in
that direction usually go through the Variance sector
to rimward-spinward.

The 0109 system has been visited by ships from
the Enclave, but HBD has not. Indeed, its name is
a humorous reference to ancient maps – Here Be
Dragons. Long-distance instrumentation suggests
an ordinary star system with a typical mix of planets,
with nothing to suggest the system is worth the effort

of getting there. There are plenty of more accessible

mapped for a very long time – if ever.

ABITORRA
Abitorra is arguably a showcase for the worst the
Solomani people are capable of. Arriving late in the
Rule of Man era, a small population of arrogant and
well-armed people found a habitable world with a
ready-made infrastructure. The fact that it belonged
to someone else was of no consequence; they used
their ship and their advanced weapons to take over.
What they co-opted was a mid-tech civilisation of
generally peaceable pseudo-reptilian humanoids who
called themselves the Sappil.

The new arrivals had little difficulty in suppressing
the Sappil and turning them into a worker caste. This
was necessary, they believed, since there were only
a few thousand humans. They had more weapons,
robots and money than sense, and set about creating

MULLINGS SUBSECTOR

Kruse

M

a paradise for themselves at the expense of the locals.
Exploration of the surrounding systems found nobody
else to oppress, so eventually the colony ships were
dismantled and used to found high-tech cities.

Naturally, there was conflict among the conquerors,
significantly reducing their already small numbers.
Sappil made lousy troops but were used as cannon-
fodder without mercy. They rebelled several times but
were put down hard each time, again at the expense
of a few human lives. After decades of conflict the final
victors established a corporate style of government
in which cities more or less govern themselves but
answer to a central directorate. This government
system has survived to the present day, becoming
enshrined in tradition. High office is gained by
climbing the corporate ladder, with backstabbing and
weaselling the preferred options.

The ultimate result of years of conflict was a reduced
gene pool which has resulted in severe inbreeding.
This is partially kept in check by advanced therapies
but the human population of Abitorra face a grim future.
Contact with the Enclave and other human states in
the region may produce a solution but the overlords of
Abitorra are not great diplomats. If they learn that some
things cannot be taken by force they may yet survive,
but this is in severe doubt.

The prevailing Tech Level of Abitorra is 8. The Sappil
have been dragged up to this level and could sustain
it if their oppressors were removed. The human
population has access to a small amount of TL10
equipment and industrial facilities. They cannot build
jump drives but do have a small orbital installation
and a handful of sublight craft. There are small towns
on other bodies in the system, each with a core
of human lords and a worker population of Sappil.
At any given time a region may be on the brink of
revolt but the human overlords have become adept
at suppressing dissent with almost clinical precision.
Bribery and concessions are used to persuade
humans to toe the line; Sappil are more likely to be
‘disappeared’ or simply rounded up and disposed of
by the security forces.

The Kruse Enclave disapproves of this activity but
prefers not to intervene. Its mission is to explore the
stars, not police ancient colonies that have gone bad.
There is a general contempt in the Enclave for the lords
of Abitorra however. True Solomani should show the
locals how to be better and lead them through slightly
patronising friendship into a mutually prosperous future.
Brutal oppression is the province of amateurs.

TUMMULDT
Tummuldt is a chaotic hotbed of small human states, all
of which seem to be in conflict with one another at least
some of the time. Armed with gunpowder weapons
and sailing ships, the people of Tummuldt are capable
of doing a great deal of damage to one another and
thus far it seems that only logistical difficulties have
prevented them from destroying their entire civilisation.

The population are clearly descended from Rule of
Man-era colonists, who cannot even agree on what their
planet is called. This population’s genetic stock is a mix
of Solomani and Vilani, which is unusual since most
such colony missions were carried out by pure-blooded
Solomani. Their exodus from Charted Space took place
late in the Twilight or early in the Long Night, and was
not well organised or supported. A technological crash
was inevitable under such circumstances.

The people of Tummuldt are almost universally hostile
to offworlders and seem to have old legends about
being attacked from the skies. This may be a reference
to events during the last days of the Ramshackle
Empire but could perhaps refer to more recent
incidents. If so, there is a hostile starfaring culture
somewhere close enough to endanger the world. The
Rammak are obvious potential culprits but there is no
evidence tying them to any attacks.

Attempts to open a dialogue with the various states
of Tummuldt have generally been met with a fusillade
of musket fire but a different approach has begun to
bear fruit. Rather than approaching major population
centres, diplomatic parties have taken to landing
in remote areas and essentially bribing the rural
population to carry messages to their leaders. Wary
meetings have since taken place, with the possibility of
some sort of formal relations. The main problem is that
all of the states want help subduing all of the others,
which the Enclave is not willing to agree to.

###### Mullings Subsector

The Neyzi subsector has a similar astrography to
Mullings, with sparse star systems to rimward and
particularly rimward-spinward. The cluster located in
the coreward-trailing corner of the subsector has been
designated the Sovereignty Cluster as it is the home
of that polity. All the systems of the cluster are claimed
by the Sovereignty, along with Jurisdiction, although its
ability to enforce this claim is in doubt.

The Sovereignty is highly centralised, with all worlds
other than Insula Suverana run as colonies or as
multiple holdings with no central authority on-planet.
Everything is run by the Elite class, who have access
to TL11 equipment manufactured on the homeworld.
However, the sustainable technology of all worlds
other than Insula Suverana is TL7 and even on the

homeworld most of what is available is TL7 standard.
Access to higher-tech items is by special permission
only, which means offworld traders have to sell to
or through the local Elites if they want to trade in
anything more advanced.

BOUNDARY
Boundary is what passes for a diplomatic and military
outpost in the Sovereignty. The world itself is a near-
worthless rockball, whose importance comes from
location and use. Mission to the Kruse Enclave and
the Interstellar Republic are staged out of the starport
before picking their way across Kane. The vessels
involved are typically armed trade ships, tasked with

going out of their way to ‘demonstrate freedom of
navigation’ in the Interstellar Republic’s vicinity before
heading to the Kruse Enclave to conduct business.
These missions of harassment are the only sign of the
centuries-old cold war between the Sovereignty and the
Republic, usually meeting a weary set-piece diplomatic
response which boils down to ‘you’re being silly but
here’s a warning shot to make you happy’. Sometimes
they are entirely ignored.

By preference, the Sovereignty likes to receive
visitors from the Kruse Enclave at Boundary rather
than the homeworld. Vessels arriving are escorted
into orbit and received with great fanfare, parades
of ground troops and all the trappings of diplomacy
from a position of strength. The Enclave’s traders
and diplomats know better than to be impressed, of
course, but it suits their purposes to play along unless
there is a point to be made. Most of what trade there
is between the two powers goes through Boundary
in both directions, enriching the Elites based there.
But for a lack of personnel, Boundary might become
powerful enough to rival the homeworld... a fact the
central authorities are not likely to forget.

INSULA SUVERANA
Homeworld and governmental centre of the
Sovereignty, Insula Suverana is rather dry, with
a basic ecosystem of its own. This has been
supplanted by imported species, some brought
from the Confederation and others transplanted
from nearby worlds. Oversight of the ecological
‘development programme’ is typically ruthless,
bordering upon brutal, with work gangs tearing up
local forests and burning scrubland to make way for

imported species. ‘Tamed’ areas are farmed in an
efficient, industrial manner or given over to luxury
produce for the benefit of the Elite class.

The majority of the population live in TL7 cities
surrounding a heavily secured TL11 hub zone. Only
the Elites and those they favour are permitted within.
Ground vehicles are the norm outside the hubs,
with grav traffic directly between the Elite zones. A
few grav vehicles and other higher-tech items are
available to assist the workers but they are strictly
controlled and their deployment is always presented
as a favour or boon from the Elites.

All aspects of society are strictly regulated, including
access to the downport and orbital highport. Offworld
visitors are extremely rare, typically being limited
to trade or diplomatic parties from the Enclave.
These are received cordially enough at the highport
but not allowed on-planet, and it is made clear that
the Sovereignty would prefer them to conduct their
business at Boundary. Those with something good
to offer are permitted to remain; mundane offers are
redirected to the diplomatic station at Boundary.

Insula Suverana can support itself in terms of food and
raw materials from its own resources but receives most
of its food from the sea-farms of Ocean Suverana and
the majority of metals and minerals from Suverana Belt.
These are the most important offworld holdings, with
ownership representing extremely high status among
the Elites. Most other offworld holdings are of minor
importance, with the Elite families that run them having
the status of provincial nobility in most cases. Those
that are of greater importance typically have business
interests on Insula Suverana and leave the running of
their holdings to subordinates.

OSTHOFF SUBSECTOR

Kruse

O

The Osthoff subsector is relatively dense as the region
goes, with a significant cluster of systems in the centre
and a main running right across the rimward end. Both
might be locally significant if the subsector is ever
colonised. However, at present it has no local human
population and no known starfaring aliens. There may
be Minor Races on some of the planets but none have
been discovered as yet. This is in part due to the low
importance assigned to Osthoff.

During the many years in which the Kruse Enclave
received little funding, expanding or just maintaining
the Enclave itself absorbed most of the available
resources. What efforts were possible were split
between exploring the immediately local systems and
attempting to push the Rimward Corridor forward.
Osthoff fell into neither category and was largely
ignored. Today, missions are being launched to the
subsector but few worlds have been properly explored
and some have not been visited at all.

CAMP OSTHOFF
Recently established by the Kruse Enclave for the
exploration of the central cluster and later the rimward
end of the subsector, Camp Osthoff is intended
to be a temporary installation – and it shows. The
entire population dwells in a single camp built from
prefabricated sections and surrounded by a berm built
from supply containers and soil. Outside this small
enclosure, wide but low piles of supply crates stand
ready for use by visiting ships.

Although broadly habitable, Camp Osthoff is not
a nice planet. It is rather cold and prone to fierce
windstorms which carry dust and loose plant matter
over considerable distances. Being outside in
such conditions is unpleasant at best and often
dangerous. Indeed, the berm around the installation
is more of a windbreak than a defensive measure.
Grav vehicles are not well suited to these conditions,
so all planetary exploration is done from ground
vehicles brought to the surface by small craft. Even a

25-ton utility boat can be blown about when trying to
fly in a storm, so grounding in a sheltered location or
avoiding the worst of the wind is essential.

With typical explorer humour, Camp Osthoff is referred
to as a ‘weather research installation’ much of the
time. In practice it is little more than a supply dump
at present, with little instrumentation or specialist
equipment other than what is mounted on its vehicles.

OSTHOFF 1937
0307 is a large world with an insidious atmosphere
and as such poses a problem to explorers.
Normally the solution would be to radar-map the
surface and leave the place alone but there are
a couple of interesting features about this world.
Its surface appears to be pitted with extremely
deep canyons. It is not possible to say just how
deep but some are at least two to four kilometres
in depth. The atmospheric pressure in the depths
of these depressions will be very high, increasing
the effective concentration of corrosive elements
in the atmosphere and creating a possibly unique
environment. Investigation will be difficult but the
canyons of 1937 represent a new frontier of science
and a challenge that cannot be passed up.

Surface scans have also turned up indications of
oddly regular solid objects. Some observers have
interpreted these as buildings or the ruins of them. If
this is true then 1937 may have indigenous people,
whose physiology would be very different from most
of the species in Charted Space. This, too, would
be a find of immense importance. Others, however,
think the orbital surveyors have found nothing more
impressive than a pile of rocks and that outfitting a
specialist expedition will absorb too much in the way
of resources. There are plenty of volunteers to take
part but thus far the Enclave has decided their lives
are too precious to stake on what is probably just
wishful thinking.

###### Osthoff Subsector

The primary astrographic feature of this subsector is
the supergiant Pletneva. This body stands in splendid
isolation, as if no other star dare come within two
parsecs of it. Pletneva does have a planetary system
of sorts, consisting of two gas giants in distant orbits.
These are subject to extreme conditions, with gases
boiled off during their closer approaches to the star.
Both leave a trail of hot gas behind in their orbits. Their
moons appear to be breaking up due to the same
stresses and, on top of all that, Pletneva is prone to
flares and bursts of radiation.

There is a third gas giant associated with the system.
It may be a rogue body or one in the process of being
captured. Either way, it permits vessels to skim fuel upon
arriving in-system, which has made the deployment
of a science ship possible. This is a long-term project,
interrupted by the need to hide behind a gas giant when
a flare erupts, and involves both study of the star and
the effects on what remains of its planetary system.
The profile given represents conditions on the least
forbidding of the outsystem giant’s moons.

ENCOUNTER
Encounter is a potentially habitable world, or rather
it once was. Today its ecosystem is dying due to an
invasive species, phenomenon or whatever else it
may be. Strange crystalline creatures are drifting into
the system, mostly in clouds but sometimes in small
clusters or even singly. Human explorers refer to them
as ‘Hordes’ for lack of a better term. The Hordes have
reached the surface of Encounter, likely in the last two
decades, and are beginning to leach the life out of it.
Each creature, or object, that crashes on Encounter
begins to extrude tendrils that draw up organic matter
and will release clouds of particles from time–to–time.
These have been observed to act like seeds, with new
creature/objects growing up where they land.

The Hordes are thought to come from rimward, possibly
originating in the cluster of worlds at the rimward-trailing
corner of the subsector. Investigating their origins is
considered an important goal but any mission into an
area they inhabit is hazardous. For that reason they are

being studied in the Encounter system first, in order to
be prepared for whatever awaits in what may or may
not be their home territory. It has not been possible
to maintain a standing deployment in the system, so
missions tend to visit for several months before retiring.
This is a hazardous operation for any ship and ground
expeditions are particularly dangerous. As yet the data
gathered has not been worth the effort or the casualties
but the possibility that the Hordes might be a threat in
the long term ensures a continued effort.

HORDE ENCOUNTERS
An individual horde member might be anything from
five metres along its main axis to over a kilometre, with
thickness and mass increasing proportionately. It has
been theorised that intelligence, or what passes for it,
is a function of the amount of horde-mass present, so
larger creatures are smarter than small ones. There is
also some evidence that the energy emissions produced
by these creatures are a form of communication,
allowing groups to function as a rather inefficient neural
net. This raises the worrying question of whether there
are super-creatures or meta-hordes of sufficient size to
become sentient, and what their plans might be.

None of the hordes thus far encountered have
presented any evidence of sentience. For the most
part they ignore passing ships and if pestered will
tend to move away rather than fight. They do begin to
cluster together if the irritation continues. Response
to attempts to remove part of a creature, such as with
a probe, produce no response on some occasions,
retreat on most, and violence in a few cases. If
a random response is needed, roll on the Horde
Response table. Add DM+1 for every incident of
‘pestering’, such as a ship following close to a creature
as it tries to move away. Minor violence, such as a
probe attempt or very intrusive energy scan adds
DM+2, whereas weapon fire adds DM+4.

If Travellers want to try to reduce the chance of a
response by manoeuvring very gently and reducing their
ship’s emissions, they may apply the Effect of an Average
(8+) Pilot or Tactics (naval) check as a negative DM.

Horde Response
2d+DMs Response
2–4 No response
5–6 Curiosity
7–8 Slow movement away (less than Thrust 1)
9–10 Rapid movement away (Thrust 2–10)
11–12 Attack
13+ Persistent Attack

The Referee can impose any result that seems
appropriate instead of using the table. When a large
horde or one containing creatures over 500 metres in
length is encountered, response tends to be less random.
In this case a horde might send some smaller creatures
to investigate the intruder whilst acting defensively or
perhaps threateningly around the largest individuals.

A Curiosity result indicates the horde creature moves
closer to the intruder and others will begin closing in
to investigate as well. They may use weak ‘pulses’
to investigate the subject. Horde creatures appear to
be capable of a sustained acceleration of anything
from 0.1–0.5 g without effort. They can dart about at
higher acceleration for short periods. Typically this is
equivalent to Thrust 3–4, but much faster creatures
have been observed. There appears to be no
correlation between size and mobility.

An attack will normally be one instance of one attack
type, whereas a persistent attack is an all-out attempt to
destroy the threat. Persistent attack results will draw in
other creatures to assist. In the case of ‘dumb hordes’
(lone small creatures and small groups that do not include
a large individual) attacks will be to the death, whereas
smarter hordes may sacrifice some whilst others escape.

HORDE CHARACTERISTICS
A creature under 20 metres in length can be
considered completely unintelligent and contributes
nothing perceptible to the group intellect. Those in
the 21–200 metre range typically have low animal
level intelligence,and apparently operate on instinct
rather than thought. 201–500 metre creatures seem to
have high-animal intellect equivalent to a cat or dog.
They may be able to make plans, such as drawing
an intruder into a trap. It is thought that 500+ metre
creatures may be as smart as some primates, such
as small monkeys. There is no evidence of sentience
or abstract thought among those that have been
encountered.

Other characteristics seem to be based on size, or rather
mass. There do not appear to be specialised organs or
cells in any of the creatures; instead the entire creature
is made up of general-purpose parts which serve as
brain, nervous system, energy storage and gathering,
and all other functions. As a general rule, a horde
creature will have the following characteristics.

If a creature is reduced to Hull 0 it is not completely
destroyed but be broken into fragments of which some
or most will be unviable. These will die over time but
could perhaps be absorbed by other horde creatures.

###### Pletneva Subsector

The largest fragment can be considered to be at the
midpoint of the next size class down, as shown on
the Horde Characteristics table, and may continue
to be a threat or seek escape. Small fragments may
also survive and begin to grow. All of these smaller
fragments can be further smashed, but the danger is
that a cloud of particles may be created which poses a
hazard to vessels in the system forever more, or drifts
to a planet and begins to feed.

A fragment cloud does damage to a ship that passes
through it equivalent to the pulse damage from the
creature that was fragmented. This attack is repeated
every 1D days but reduced by half each time, until the
fragments are somehow removed or finally die. A ship
having its hull eaten away in this manner might land
or go to an installation, bringing the horde’s fragments
with it. The only sure way to destroy a creature without
a fragmentation cloud is to deliver 10 times its Hull
points in some super-destructive manner. Plasma and
fusion weapons work well but conventional explosives
tend to just spread the fragments around. Nuclear
and antimatter explosions will work reasonably well,
although there is always a chance that some fragments
may be flung away rather than incinerated.

All creatures can generate a pulse which takes the
form of a gravity wave with some additional emissions.
This may be weak pulse, typically insufficient to harm
a spacecraft but may push it around a little and is
used mainly to investigate objects. A weak pulse
does damage on the ground scale. A strong pulse is
intended to harm ships and other objects, and does
damage on the spacecraft scale.

**GROUNDSIDE**
A grounded horde creature can generate a weak
pulse to defend itself, throwing personnel and
perhaps even vehicles aside, and causing serious
damage. It is not clear if a strong pulse can be
generated on the ground, although some scientists

have suggested it might be possible as a form of
defence against missiles or similar threats if the
creature survives long enough to learn or observe
what is happening to others. No known form of
shielding exists to protect against these pulses.

The fragments of creatures known as ‘spores’ or ‘seeds’
pose a real hazard to Travellers, whether as airborne
clouds or on the ground as particles or tendrils. Skin
contact causes 2D damage for 1D rounds after contact,
then 2D more every 1D minutes unless the fragments
are removed. They will essentially dissolve organic
matter and consume it, eating their way into the victim.
There may be time to knock the fragments off if they
are external. If inhaled or otherwise consumed, the
victim is almost certainly doomed. Protective equipment
such as typical field boots and respirators are degraded
over a period of 2D minutes. Vacc suits and the like will
protect five times as long, whilst battle dress or hostile or
corrosive environment gear has a mean time to failure of
2D hours. Decontamination will save a person or vehicle
but there is the problem of what to do with the fragments.
Incineration or dissolving in acid will work but in the case
of large-scale contamination the only sure option is to
take off and nuke the site from orbit. Repeatedly.

THUSFAR
Thusfar represents the deepest penetration rimward
into the subsector the Kruse Enclave has yet achieved.
For reasons connected more with pride than with
scientific endeavour, the world has been extensively
mapped and analysed. There is nothing particularly
remarkable about it; Thusfar is a small planet with a
thin atmosphere and little water, whose ecosystem
has not evolved beyond fungi and lichen equivalents.
Nevertheless, a full expedition has been mounted,
bypassing more accessible worlds. Thusfar is used as
a training showcase for young potential explorers in the
Enclave, although it is likely this may be just an excuse
to remind everyone how daring and dedicated the
explorers from Kruse are.

###### Pletneva Subsector

Whereas the Lubbock Enclave is primarily concerned
with the activities of the Aslan Hierate to spinward, the
Kruse Enclave is charged with the investigation of the
Mid-Rimward Area of Interest, more commonly known
as ‘Midrim’. This includes Kruse of course but also the
Two Veils, the Reaches and the Strange Region. Each
of these is a two-sector area of operations with its own
unique challenges and potential discoveries.

TWO VEILS
The Ruthless Veil and Darkly Veiled sectors are
characterised by spacetime anomalies such as jump
shoals and reefs. The effect is particularly serious in
the so-called Hoydell Chaos, which stretches across
the spinward-rimward quarter of Darkly Veiled. Starship
operations in this area are particularly hazardous
and even going near the region is a problem as its
boundaries shift in an unpredictable manner. These
anomalies are thought to be connected with a dense
nebula located in the rimward end of Ruthless Veil,
although there are no obvious correlations between
interstellar gas and jump drive problems.

The nebula is variously referred to as The Ruthless
Veil, Hoydell’s Veil and the Quill Nebula. The
official designation is Hoydell’s Veil, in honour of
the commander who led the first expeditions into
it. Her ship was posted overdue in 1002. Whilst no
wreckage has been found it is certain the entire
expedition was lost. The probable causes include
misjump, drive failure in jump or fuel shortage during
an extended-duration jump.

Exploration of this region is ongoing, although extreme
caution is necessary. Some disruption of jump drive
function is observed in most nebulae but there is
something else at play here. Some scientists have
postulated that the event that created the nebula
might have been different to what is usually observed.
Perhaps the star was of exotic composition or a
particularly violent event has somehow caused ripples
in the fabric of spacetime. At present there is no clear
indication as to what happened or why, which intrigues
Solomani scientists to the point where exploration of
this dangerous area is deemed necessary.

# T AREA OF INTEREST

## HE MID-RIMWARD

THE REACHES
RimReach and OutReach are of interest for different
reasons. There is an old military axiom that it is better
to fight an enemy in their backyard than your own, and
for this reason alone long-range exploration is worth a
decent percentage of the military budget. The Solomani
Confederation remembers what its predecessors did
to the Vilani Imperium and is determined to detect
any such threat when it is small and far away. Cursory
exploration and investigation of potential threats is
easy to justify to the budget-planners, as is surveying
potential life-bearing worlds and any signs of a
technological society. Any of these can lead to early
detection of a threat. Getting the planners to sign off
on more detailed exploration for scientific purposes
requires more persuasion.

OutReach has not produced a lot of alerts or points of
military interest and all of those have led to a ‘minimal
or no threat’ decision. This is a useful result in its
own right but it does mean that activity in this sector
is given a low priority. RimReach has been less fully
explored, for the opposite reason. There are rumours
that a parasitic life form, sometimes referred to as the
Valkyrie for obscure reasons, is present on several
worlds in this sector. Valkyrie infestation has been
likened to possession, with the host fully controlled.
Hosts are thought to deteriorate once infested and to
die within a few years.

The Confederation naturally wants to know as
much as possible about the Valkyrie without risking
contamination. To this end a quarantine science base
has been set up in the coreward end of OutReach,
from which vessels operate very carefully in RimReach.
It is thought that there is some kind of state or polity
made up of Valkyrie hosts; perhaps more than one.
Infestations have been observed elsewhere, including
worlds in the Malorn sector close to the Confederation
border. Determining the means of infestation and
the extent of the ‘contaminated’ zone is an important
mission but one best carried out at arm’s length. For
reasons that are not disclosed below the highest
security clearances it is believed the Valkyrie originated
in RimReach and it is here the Confederation hopes to
discover a means to nullify this threat.

STRANGE REGION
The Strange region consists of two sectors. The
rimwardmost is dominated by the Flous Nebula from
which it gets its name. Navigation in this sector is
problematic due to interstellar gas clouds, some
of which are forming into protostars. A few have
reached the T-Tauri stage but will not have formed
any useable planets. Experiments have been
conducted with interstellar ramjets in this region, in
an attempt to harvest gas and separate out hydrogen
for fuel. This seems doable but it is a slow process
at the best of times. Gas cloud refuelling will in all
likelihood remain a novelty, to be used only when
necessary to reach very remote systems.

The Strange sector has a higher stellar density
and more normal star types than Flous Nebula
and is named for the unusually high proportion of

interesting discoveries and anomalies noted during
early exploration. These include astrographical
anomalies such as several binary stars with an
extensive planetary system surrounding each, strange
ecosystems and the presence of oddly similar ruins on
several worlds across the sector.

It is currently thought that the sector was once home
to a slower-than-light starfaring civilisation, which
built settlements on several worlds before dying
out. No homeworld has been identified and overall
settlement seems to have been in small numbers – a
few thousand individuals at most. Little is known about
the physical attributes of this species, other than the
fact they seem to be bipedal and a little smaller than
humans. Naturally, these mysterious builders and
starfarers are semi-officially known as the Strangers.

The Mid-rimward Area of Interest

After Lubbock, the Rimward Corridor narrows
considerably. The intent was to drive a channel of
explored systems out as far as possible and create a
support base from which to launch expeditions all the
way to the edge of the spiral arm. Once this channel
was established, vessels headed for the far end
could take small side trips to widen the explored area,
returning to known space to speed up the transit or to
recover from setbacks. Side expeditions have been
launched in order to investigate interesting phenomena
or emissions that suggest a technological civilisation
exists somewhere nearby.

The Distant Rimward Corridor terminates in the
Xuanzang sector, over 400 parsecs from the
Confederation border. A typical support vessel will
average 2.6 parsecs per week along this route,
allowing for a halt at Lubbock and some delays
here and there. A trip to the far end will take a little
under four years, which corresponds to a standard
term of service in the Confederation Navy. It is not
uncommon for a spacer to spend a couple of months
of their first term in training and gaining experience
on local operations, then to sign up for a ‘Full Rim
Run’ before serving out the last months locally and
mustering out after two 4–year terms.

Full Rim Runs are becoming less necessary in recent
years as the forward base in Xuanzang develops
its own industrial capability. Heavy investment early
in the project included large numbers of colonists,
creating a population base capable of supporting
development and conducting exploration. Concerns
about the loyalty of such a distant colony resulted in
a mandatory population exchange programme. Every
year, volunteers from the Confederation’s worlds and
the Xuanzang Enclave are shipped in low berths to the
Lubbock Enclave, where they are transferred to ships
bound out or back. A proportion of these people join the
population of worlds in the Lubbock Enclave; the rest
spend a period living and working at the opposite end
of the corridor. Not all choose to go home but whether
they settle or return, the programme has served its
purpose of ensuring the distant enclaves do not drift too
far from core Solomani values.

# T RIMWARD REGION

## HE DISTANT

The sectors of the Distant Rimward Corridor are
mostly named for [[Terra|Terran]] explorers. Other sectors
are assigned a designation based upon their relative
position to the Rimward Corridor. For example,
RC+5+2 is five sectors rimward of Amundsen and
two sectors to trailing. These designations will
eventually be replaced by names once some event
or discovery suggests an appropriate one.

The Distant Rimward Corridor proceeds to spinward-
rimward of Lubbock, passing through the corner
of the Variance sector before entering Amundsen.
From there it runs through Humboldt, Cousteau
and Workman before reaching Xuanzang. This is
the location of the most distant officially recognised
enclave of the Solomani Confederation. It is rumoured
there may be others, including the ‘great repository’
where Solomani culture and values can be preserved
even in the event that the Imperials overrun the
whole Confederation. A persistent tale speaks of
vast industrial bases hidden far from enemy reach,
producing battleships and cruisers for the final
showdown with the Imperium. It is highly unlikely
these installations exist as described but smaller
enclaves have been established here and there.

SEEDING THE RIM
The Solomani Confederation, whether
deliberately or not, is slowly seeding the area
of space to rimward of its borders with colonies.
Most are single worlds or a central base for the
exploitation of nearby worlds and in some cases
pre-existing populations have been assimilated.
These were mostly Rule of Man-era colonial
expeditions ‘rescued’ from their troubles by the
arrival of high-technology goods and skilled
personnel. Over time, these tiny enclaves
will expand and eventually flow together to
dominate a huge area of space. This is a very
long-term plan, however, and it is being carried
out on a limited budget.

###### The Distant rimward Region

The Xuanzang Enclave is smaller than the Lubbock
Enclave but sufficient to support its own needs and to
function as a base for future exploration. Four worlds
have been colonised, with the majority of support going
to Hsuien Tsang. A population of just over nine million is
growing steadily, with new cities spreading out over the
surface of a hospitable planet. As with other Solomani
colonies in the Distant Rimward Region, [[Terra|Terran]] species
have been introduced but the ecosystem of Hsuien
Tsang is well developed and resilient. A great deal of
effort has been necessary to get the invader species
established and any let-up inevitably leads to the native
species pushing back.

The Enclave is governed in much the same manner as
Lubbock. Appointed officials make all the decisions but
receive advice from elected representatives. Central
control over the secondary worlds is stronger than at
Lubbock, largely since these are at present little more
than extensions of the colony at Hsuien Tsang. The
Enclave also has a lot less warships than Lubbock.

# T HE XUANZANG ENCLAVE

There are plenty of armed auxiliaries and exploration
vessels but only a handful of combat-oriented ships. If
a significant threat were to emerge, additional vessels
could be constructed but at present they represent
poor value for money and spend most of their time
performing routine survey work in nearby systems.

The Xuanzang Enclave was settled beginning in 907, in
the early phases of what is now known as the Rimward
3 project. The initial heavy investment was followed
by a much smaller support and follow-up programme,
which was sustained and steady until the curtailment of
Rimward 3 due to tensions with the Imperials. Where
Lubbock and Kruse were well established at this
point, Xuanzang was just getting started. As a result
everything about it has a rough-and-ready feeling.
The long hiatus in all but the most basic of support
has resulted in some political drift and disaffection as
well as hampering growth, and there are occasional
rumblings of an independence movement. There are
those who wonder if the Confederation would even
notice if its most distant outpost broke away.

TRAVELLER

and unwieldy objects with surprising ease. Several
hundred have been recruited by the Xuanzang
Enclave as construction crews and assistants when
exploring the surface of habitable planets. Breathing
apparatus is not difficult to provide but creating a
pressure suit for a Vdknwbo is a challenge that has
not yet been satisfactorily met.

It is possible that the Vdknwbo are native to neither
of the worlds where they have been encountered.
Atmospheric and climatic conditions are very different
between the two and are tolerable rather than ideal
for the Vdknwbo. Their current level of advancement
approximates TL6 on both worlds, although there
are differences in approach to the same situations.
The Vdknwbo have legends of a time when they
voyaged for ‘a very long time’ aboard slower-than-
light starships. They understand the concepts of
interstellar travel but cannot say for certain whether
their legends speak of in-system exploration and
colonisation of one other world or whether they came
to both from some distant star.

The Vdknwbo have accepted Solomani leadership
almost enthusiastically. Individuals and small groups
like the good salaries the Enclave pays, whilst
leaders are keen to leverage the usefulness of their
people in return for technological assistance. The
Enclave has in general provided self-contained
benefits, in accordance with standard policy. Rather
than teaching the locals how to improve their own
technology, Solomani teams have built hospitals and
power plants. These improve quality of life without
giving the Vdknwbo any new capabilities. Overall, the
relationship between the Enclave and the Vdknwbo
worlds might be summed up as ‘good friends but not
necessarily trusted friends’.

THE VDKNWBO
Generally referred to as the ‘Unpronouceables’ or
‘Crabbers’, the Vdknwbo may be native to Moksadeva
709 or 808. Their own names for these worlds are,
like the rest of their spoken language, rather tricky to
pronounce without a Vdknwbo’s mouthparts. They are
curious creatures, with an almost circular six-legged
lower torso which bears a slight resemblance to a
crab’s body. Atop this is an upper torso with two pairs
of arms. The upper pair are quite delicate and can
perform complex tasks whilst the lower ones are used
for digging and lifting.

The ‘Crabbers’ have two sexes and lay clutches of
up to a dozen eggs. Young are raised collectively,
although how strong parental bonds may be is as
yet unclear. Similarly, their preferred governmental
structure – if that is the right word – is complex and
apparently subject to abrupt change. It seems there
is some kind of hierarchy of individual leaders who
speak for those who wish to be led but how status
is determined is unknown. Several groups may give
their loyalty to a higher leader, creating temporary
alliances that can be quite large. Conflict is rare, with
most disputes settled by extremely lengthy discourse.
It may be that higher leadership is a matter of having
more patience than the opposition, outlasting them
rather than out-arguing them.

Vdknwbo move in a rapid scuttle and can change
direction very quickly. They are also extremely stable
when all their feet are planted and can lift heavy

###### The Xuanzang Enclave

Rimward progress continues through Smurgis and
Skylax, with data becoming increasingly sketchy with
distance rimward. Extremely long-range missions
are known to have pushed all the way to the edge
of the spiral arm but these were more concerned
with covering distance than conducting detailed
exploration. In general, only the most prominent
features are detailed past Skylax.

Likewise, expeditions back towards Charted
Space are given low priority. Other than what was
necessary for the security of the transit corridor,
little detailed exploration has been carried out in
this direction. With official attention on the ‘big
picture’ of rimward exploration, there are countless
opportunities for minor operations. Of course, these
have to be conducted on a shoestring in a largely
unknown region – which in turn creates a need for
rescue and support missions which can produce a
good return in both the short and long term.

The definition of an Extremely Long-Range Mission,
or ELM, has evolved over the decades. This is
more about perception than technology, although
improvements in personnel management have
contributed to the ability to cover great distances and
return safely. The main technical obstacle is the jump
drive, for obvious reasons. A malfunction in well-
travelled space can be dangerous; out on the rim it
is likely to be fatal. However, jump drives are more
robust than the average person might believe.

The Solomani Confederation has conducted its
extremely long-range exploration in a methodical
manner for the most part. A ground-breaking mission
to an area far beyond what has been known before
is followed by the establishment of a base or enclave
from which to stage the next wave of exploration, whilst
follow-up missions explore the region around the new
base and out from the corridor of known space created
by the initial expedition. As a result, the edge of what is
known is pushed ever further out. However, this does
mean there is an enormous amount of space to be
explored behind the current frontier.

ADVENTURES IN

THE XUANZANG ENCLAVE

The Xuanzang Enclave is all about exploration and
contact with new alien civilisations. The Enclave was
set up with the intent of supporting extremely long-
range expeditions out to the edge of the spiral arm,
with local operations coming a long way second.
A security sweep for obvious threats was carried
out before any worlds were colonised, after which
exploration of the immediate area proceeded at a
slow pace. Basic data exists for most worlds within
20 parsecs of the enclave and for many more distant
systems. However, the waiting list for missions to
follow up initial surveys just keeps getting longer.

Rimward and rimward-spinward are the priorities for the
enclave’s expeditions, with a secondary area of interest
to trailing. An area of low stellar density sometimes
known as ‘The Spinner’ for obscure reasons lies
around six parsecs to trailing-rimward. It has fascinated
Solomani astronomers for centuries and now lies within
reach of exploration missions. Of particular interest is
the area of relatively normal density within the ‘base’
of The Spinner. It may be that this is nothing more or
less than a collection of normal stars but even so the
astrographic conditions that created this area of relative
density amid the rift may be interesting. There are
suggestions that something truly exceptional may lie
there but these may arise only from a desire to get a
budget for exploration approved.

The route towards The Spinner is gradually being
explored. A known corridor through Mayer’s Transit and
the Behaypoe sectors is gradually being pushed out.
Attempts to explore trailingward by way of Fallshort and
Hopes Dashed ran into difficulties as a result of stellar
density and system locations, making Mayer’s Transit
the obvious and perhaps only viable route trailingwards.
This is complicated by reports of a multi-world culture in
Behaypoe, which is designated by an approximation of
the dominant species’ name for itself.

###### The Xuanzang Enclave

RIMWARD 0 (-600 TO -120)
What are now known as the Rimward 0 missions
began before the foundation of the Third Imperium,
probably around -600 or so. The Old Earth Union,
a predecessor of the Solomani Confederation, was
naturally interested in what lay beyond its rimward
frontier, as part of a general programme of exploration
in all directions. The Aslan Border Wars were the
primary cause for concern at the time and whilst the
Old Earth Union was not directly engaged in conflict
with the Aslan clans, considerable assets were
dedicated to supporting the human governments that
were. These were troubled times, in which a project to
set up a base or integrate a region might have to be put
on hold for decades due to some sudden reversal of
fortune or events elsewhere.

Missions were launched, however, exploring a region
2–3 sectors rimward of Terra in a cursory manner.
These were followed by trade ships where a potential
market was identified and whilst [[Terra|Terran]] interests
were driven from the region several times over the
centuries, a passing familiarity was developed with
the worlds of these sectors. Longer-range missions
may have been launched from time–to–time, but
few details are available. The Rimward 0 period
is considered to end around -120, when a period
of instability caused all available resources to be
reallocated to securing the frontiers. Some trade
links were maintained but these corridors were
under pressure, with inadequate resources to protect
them. Rimward expansion and exploration had to be
curtailed in favour of core activities.

RIMWARD 1 (230–340)
The Rimward 1 missions began in the 230s, with a
reopening of trade links and the establishment of
forward trading bases in the sectors immediately to
rimward of the Confederation. A lot had happened
in three centuries of tenuous contact, so the early
Rimward 1 period was very much about re-charting
what is now the Close Rimward Region. Missions to the
far end of this area were, by the standards of the time,
extremely long-range expeditions.

Explorers did head out further, notably during the ‘big
push’ of 240–280. This was characterised by private
enterprise, with independent missions following the
better-equipped official expeditions. In most cases
there was cooperation, with the private missions
subcontracting to scout the flanks of the main
expedition or following up on interesting discoveries.
However, the project did become something of
a free-for-all. Numerous colonies and resource
extraction facilities were set up without central
oversight and as attention shifted elsewhere some of
these quietly became independent.

By 300, the Old Earth Union was far more interested
in its coreward frontier. Imperial expansion was a
cause for concern and the annexation of territory by
the Imperials produced a wave of minor crises and
destabilisation of the region to coreward of the Union’s
borders. Attempts were made to take advantage of
this and more often to prevent disruption of trade
links, all of which absorbed the available resources
for many years. Eventually the region between the
Old Earth Union and the Imperium was pacified and
integrated, with a safe corridor open by 332. The
Union itself joined the Imperium in 588.

As part of the Imperium, the former Old Earth Union
found it had wider concerns. Contact with the Zhodani
was followed by war between their Consulate and the
Imperium from 589 to 604. As part of the Imperium,
albeit a new one, the former Old Earth Union was
expected to contribute. This took the form of supplying
ships to protect regions whose forces had been
reduced to reinforce those facing the Zhodani. Hardly
had these vessels arrived than they were plunged
into the Imperial Civil War of 604 to 622. This, and
the concurrent Second Frontier War, severely drained
the resources of the Imperium and the former Union
naturally had to play its part in making good the losses.

Historians often speculate how events might have
transpired if the Old Earth Union had joined the
Imperium a couple of years later, or not at all. A deal
that seemed beneficial almost instantly became a
requirement to help save the Imperium, or so Solomani
history records. Certainly the two decades after
integration were rather one-sided and it may be that the

seeds of the independence movement were planted
here. Be that as it may, rimward exploration was not an
option for many more years.

RIMWARD 2 (720–850)

By the late 600s, the aftershocks of Imperial integration
had largely faded and the Solomani people enjoyed
a position of great prestige within the Imperium. That
changed in 697 when Emperor Zhakirov married
Antiama Shiisuginsa. Solomani power was broken at
the Imperial court and replaced with traditional Vilani
interests. To Solomani eyes, the megacorporations
had taken over the Imperium and their own business
groups were losing out everywhere – including in their
traditional home territories.

Disaffection increased and one of its symptoms was
renewed interest in the ‘stars beyond the reach of the
corps’ – the rimward frontier. In 704 the increasingly
disgruntled people of the former Old Earth Union
were permitted self-government as the Solomani
Autonomous region. Gradually, Imperial interests were
edged out in favour of traditional Solomani values
and organisations. This was misrepresented – so the
Solomani say – as oppression of non-Solomani and
would eventually lead to the Solomani Rim War.

In the meantime, a resurgence of interest saw several
long-range missions pushed out to rimward. To support
them, several minor bases were established in what
became known as the Rimward Corridor, with a major
installation in Lubbock. Work began on construction
in the 750s, along with exploration of a modest local
area. The identification of a number of points of interest
prompted the deployment of a forward base in Kruse,
with work beginning in the 830s.

The Lubbock Enclave was always intended as a
colonial region capable of supporting exploration using
its own resources and was expected to assist in the
development of a series of small enclaves and forward
bases stretching right out to the edge of the spiral arm.
However, getting to that point took time and absorbed
a lot of resources. As a result, exploration was local to
the Kruse and Lubbock Enclaves for the remainder of
the Rimward 2 period.

RIMWARD 3 (900–950)

The Rimward 3 phase built on the maturing Lubbock
and Kruse installations, pushing out several subsectors
in all directions and establishing what was to be

‘Lubbock 2’ in Xuanzang. This was a lot of territory
to cover using only limited resources, meaning that
large areas between the Confederation and Xuanzang
remain unexplored to this day. Two particular points
of interest absorbed a great deal of effort during
this time. The first was not directly connected with
Solomani rimward exploration but was of great interest
to strategic planners. Missions were pushed out to
trailing from the Close Rimward Area of Interest. The
intent was to determine how far the Hive Federation
had explored and to determine if its expansion
rimward could be curtailed in some manner. Parallel
missions were sent out from the Kruse Enclave despite
astrographic difficulties, with much the same intent.

At the same time, there was great interest in the area
of low stellar density roughly seven sectors to trailing-
rimward of the Lubbock Enclave. Known informally as
‘The Spinner’, this region contains a number of unusual
radio sources and possible gravitational anomalies.
Exactly why the top echelons of Solomani government
were so interested remains a secret but expeditions
were launched even when this meant taking resources
away from other projects.

The plan was to make an ‘ascent’ in the manner of a
mountain climb, establishing temporary support bases
along the way. Temporary in this case would probably
mean 20 years in situ, with camps obtaining some
local resources but mostly serving as supply bases for
ships out of Lubbock. It was to be quite an undertaking
and was presumably thought to be worth the effort.
However, the project did not get past its early phases.

Each phase was to begin with a general exploration of
a sector or so, with the intent of establishing a support
base somewhere suitable. Supply ships could then
develop and provision this base whilst it served as a
launching point for the next phase. Each phase was
more difficult than the last, mostly due to the distances
involved. More and more ship-months were absorbed
in keeping each base viable and progress slowed to
a crawl. The will to continue was there but the project
was overtaken by events. Increasing tension with the
Imperium necessitated the transfer of resources to war
preparations and in 990 the Solomani Rim War broke
out. Rimward 3 came to a sudden stop, with forward
bases abandoned and support ships ordered to report
to Confederation space for service with the fleet.
Some arrived in time to be useful, others just after the
cessation of hostilities. A significant proportion were
short-stopped at Kruse or Lubbock for local operations.

Extremely Long Range Expeditions

TRAVELLER

RIMWARD 3A (1010–1028)
In the years after the Solomani Rim War, there were
few resources for exploration or anything other than
reconstruction of the fleet in case hostilities broke
out again. Despite this, some resources were prized
loose to maintain the forward bases. The supply
vessels held at Lubbock and Kruse had soldiered on
for decades just to maintain communications, with little
opportunity for expansion or major expedition. As they
wore out, the decision had to be made to abandon the
forward enclaves to their own fate or spend money the
Confederation simply did not have.

In the end, a few supply ships were assigned along
with some of the vessels left over from the Solomani
Rim War. These were in a state whereby they needed
rebuilding to be any use in combat, so repurposing
for ‘Rimward 3a’ and replacing them with new-build
ships was seen as better value for money. This influx
of vessels saved the Rimward project but operations
throughout the 3a phase were directed mainly at
re-establishing links and repairing bases rather than
pushing out. For this reason the project has been
designated 3a rather than 4.

RIMWARD 4 (1029–1046)

Rimward 4 was to be an ambitious drive up the
Rimward Corridor and far beyond. It was to include a
new attempt to reach The Spinner and missions to the
edge of the spiral arm both directly rimward and in a
rimward-spinward direction from the Lubbock Enclave.
The previous ‘chain of bases’ approach was shelved
in favour of long-range ships or groups of ships.
Observers have suggested this might indicate a lack
of confidence in the future of long-range exploration.
A chain of bases represents a good investment if they
are to be used to support multiple missions but the
events of Rimward 3 and the subsequent ‘Retreat from
the Rim’ made the Confederation reluctant to invest
in installations that might be abandoned or left to their
own devices for decades.

There are alternative explanations. It may be that the
Confederation’s pro-exploration factions needed to
obtain results quickly. This might shake loose additional
funds or prevent cuts. If so, wasting some money
now on an inefficient one-off mission might be a good
investment in the long term if it meant a return to the
gradual establishment of support bases. It has also
been suggested that there was something ‘out there’
that needed attending to as soon as possible.

Whatever the truth of this, Rimward 4 was massively
scaled back soon after it began. The ships were still
assigned but they were given a new mission. For over
a decade, rebuilt warships and exploration vessels
that were not well suited to the task fought a quiet
war against their Aslan counterparts in the region to
spinward of the Lubbock Enclave. This may have
been a simple territorial dispute or an attempt to
curtail settlement close to the regions of interest to the
Confederation. However, there are indications of secret
missions within the wider conflict. Rumours persist of
‘sites of interest’ being seized and pillaged or destroyed
before the Aslan could find or exploit them. Just what
was so important is unclear – which is an indication of
how seriously the Confederation took this conflict.

RIMWARD 5 (1069–PRESENT)
After the derailment of Rimward 4 and, a renewed
push for exploration began in 1069. At first this was
a minor matter; a few extra ships assigned to the
supply runs and some converted carriers pushed out
to support operations around Lubbock and Kruse.
Over time the project gained momentum, until today
the resources assigned have finally reached the levels
of Rimward 3. The maturity of the Lubbock Enclave
has also allowed ships to be built there in sufficient
numbers to expand the exploration fleet.

It remains to be seen whether there will be a return
to the ‘gradual ascent’ model of exploration. At
present the emphasis is still on ships rather than
bases, although a few small installations have been
set up here and there. Older facilities have been
reoccupied, which has required rebuilding or in some
cases even searching for an abandoned site whose
location has not been preserved. There were a few
surprises along the way, and almost certainly more to
come. In the meantime, major expeditions have been
launched to certain points of interest.

THE GREAT BACKFILL
The ‘Great Backfill’ is not a single mission but a major
project to fill in all the blanks on the navigational charts.
Even on or close to the Rimward Corridor there are
systems that have never been visited, or which were
cursorily charted 200 years or more ago and ignored
ever since. Missions are constantly sent out from
Lubbock, Kruse and Xuanzang to expand knowledge of
these areas. There is also a waiting list of systems and
planets considered worth a follow-up visit.

Extremely Long Range Expeditions

Filling in these blanks is the current bread and butter
of Solomani exploration. Missions tend to be a few
months in duration rather than grand cruises lasting
years. They are supported by small installations
scattered along the Rimward Corridor, most of which
are under-resourced and doing the best they can.
There is just so much to do and limited resources to
do it with. In particular, ‘backfill’ missions in the region
between the Lubbock Enclave and the Confederation
border tend to be carried out by ships transferred due
to their unfitness for front-line naval service.

Even in the areas with the most ships, this is a
gargantuan task which will take decades or more to
complete. Plans to investigate a particular system
are often pushed back multiple times as a follow-up
elsewhere becomes more urgent. It may be that there
are other considerations beneath the surface. It has
often been lamented that the warships transferred to
Lubbock were not fully or properly converted to an
exploration role. For example, several Hermes-class
carriers were transferred after relatively minor work.
They may be reduced in capability compared to a
front-line example but they remain more warfighters
than explorers. Perhaps it is not coincidental that
whilst these ships are not up to tackling the best the
Imperium could throw at them, they are more than
capable of dealing with an Aslan ihatei band. The
‘quiet war’ might not have ended in the 1040s.

PROJECT PERSEUS
The most famous of all Solomani exploration projects,
and perhaps the most grandiose in all history, is
Project Perseus. Little is known outside the highest
echelons of Solomani administration and it may be
that everything that has leaked out is false. According
to the popular version of the tale, 17 base ships,
each with multiple subordinate vessels, were sent
out from the Confederation around 1050. The official
records are strangely sparse during this period, as if
to conceal all possible data and even inferences made
from unrelated subjects.

There are those who say that Project Perseus never
happened at all, or that it had a completely different
goal and direction, but the general belief is that the
intent was to cross to the Perseus Arm and explore
as much of it as possible. Why the Confederation
would choose to do this when there was still so much
unknown space between its borders and the edge
of the spiral arm remains a mystery. If there was a
known threat or great treasure that might explain
the urgency but how could the project’s instigators
possibly have known about it?

According to common belief, 14 of the base ships
are accounted for. Thirteen have re-entered
Confederation space whilst one, the Iouo, has
been sighted by vessels on the Rimward Corridor
but has not reached the Confederation itself. The
others are overdue, their fates unknown. It is said
that the Iouo explored systems on the fringe of the
Auriga Arm, some 3,000 parsecs from Home but
this has never been confirmed. Nor have there been
any great announcements of triumphs, finds or sad
losses. Instead the ships have quietly slipped into
Confederation space and effectively disappeared.
They are most likely receiving a long-overdue refit at
some naval base or other but it is decidedly strange
that their crews have not been feted in the media –
or even mentioned much at all.

SPINWARD/TRAILING^

BRANCH EXPEDITIONS
Several missions have been launched to spinward
or trailing from the Rimward Corridor. Most stage
through the Lubbock Enclave before striking out for
their final destinations. Those headed to spinward
normally follow an indirect path that takes them well
past any areas of Aslan interest. The majority of these
expeditions are aimed at a region 2–4 sectors from the
Rimward Corridor but a suitably interesting objective
might prompt a much longer mission. One such is the
gravitational anomaly located at Point QX-07012, which
lies in a region of sparse stellar density sometimes
described as the mouth of the Great Rift. It is thought to
have something to do with the formation of the Rift.

The early part of the mission followed a practice
used whenever sufficient ships are available. Nine
Tenzing-class exploration vessels, supported by a
converted light carrier, pushed out from the Lubbock
Enclave headed roughly spinward-rimward. During
the first phase of the mission the Tenzings proceeded
in three groups of three along parallel axes, with the
carrier following. Each group of three ships followed
a leapfrog pattern, with one ship pushing ahead,
another staying behind to investigate a find and
the third moving fast to catch up to the leader after
completing its own investigation.

When the expedition reached its first area of interest,
the carrier and three of the Tenzings began a general
exploration and investigation of points of interest,
whilst three more headed rimward on parallel courses
to create a ‘known zone’. These vessels have now
returned, bringing with them a wealth of data which

TRAVELLER

Solsec agent

has been widely publicised. The crews were as usual
welcomed as heroes – in stark contrast to those
engaged in Project Perseus.

The other three ships proceeded spinward as a group,
on a voyage of around 700 parsecs. The mission
should be reaching its goal in the near future, unless
it has already done so. Relatively little exploration
is expected to be carried out en route, other than
what is necessary to obtain fuel and provisions. This
controversial decision was prompted by rumours that
the Imperial Deepnight Corporation was planning
an expedition to the same general area of space. If
the gravitational anomaly at QX-07012 turns out to
be scientifically significant the Confederation wants
that knowledge first. Even if it is not, being in place
to greet the Imperials when they arrive would be
something of a political triumph.

This particular mission was prompted by the discovery
of old records dating from the Rule of Man era. The
QX-07012 gravitational anomaly was discovered
during this period, possibly from captured Vilani
materials. Believing they were capable of anything by
that point, the leaders of the Rule of Man implemented
a rather grandiose plan to investigate it. At least two
long-range support bases were to be built to support

this operation. However, the Rule of Man was known
as the Ramshackle Empire for a reason; the project
collapsed and resources were directed elsewhere.

It is possible that one or more bases were constructed
and that there may be tiny enclaves of Solomani
humans somewhere on the predicted expedition route.
If this is the case, it was not mentioned in the data
brought home – but that is only to be expected. If they
do exist, follow-up missions are virtually certain. The
current status of the three vessels headed for QX-
07012 is detailed in Deepnight Revelation: Voidshore.

THE VENTURI EXPEDITIONS
The Venturi Expeditions are a private operation
directed towards something known only as ‘Object
Venturi’. Launched generally rimward from Lubbock
from the 1080s onwards, this ongoing project
appears to take the form of a series of advances
reminiscent of the old ‘chain of camps’ approach.
Although overseen by the Confederation authorities,
Venturi is funded by a consortium of investors,
corporations and individual world governments.

The internal organisation of this consortium appears
to be somewhat chaotic, with shifting priorities and
reassignment of resources commonplace. Backers
have pulled out and re-joined, with others coming
into the project late. Each time this happens there is
another reorganisation of assets, making progress
towards Object Venturi rather slow. It seems that
the project members have differing objectives and
levels of commitment which might result in the total
collapse of the project.

It is certain that the central Coalition government
knows – or thinks it knows – what Object Venturi is. No
large-scale cooperative-ish project would be permitted
to launch without oversight and large numbers of
SolSec agents embedded among its crews. This does
not rule out the possibility of a hidden agenda on the
part of some or all of the participants, nor of betrayal
when Object Venturi is finally reached. Rumours from
within the project speak of everything from dedicated
siblinghood among the personnel assigned to a
pestilential swamp of paranoia and double-dealing. The
experiences of one crew assigned to Venturi might be
quite different to those of another.

# W MYSTERIES OF THE RIM

## ONDERS AND

The Travellers will, for the most part, make their own
adventures out on the rim. As they explore a world they
will have to solve the problems it throws at them and
efforts to obtain supplies and equipment can lead to all
manner of bargains, agreements and confrontations.
As a general rule, any decision to do something
immediately creates several other things that have to
be done first or as well. This is the day-to-day reality
of the exploration business, which can explode into an
adventure at almost any point.

The following entries can be slotted into the campaign
wherever the Referee thinks best. Some are points
of interest; others have a wider significance. The
Referee can build a campaign around one or another
of the mysteries, perhaps openly and perhaps not.
For example, the Travellers may be involved in a
general push out towards a known point of interest,
or associated with a mission aimed at solving one of
the mysteries. Alternatively, they may stumble over
clues which lead them to other star systems, finally
discovering something no-one else even suspects
exists. In the interim, other minor discoveries can be
inserted to maintain the sense of wonder that should
accompany a voyage into the unknown.

THE SPINNER
The Spinner is an area of low to very low stellar density
within an otherwise normal area of space. Rifts of
this sort do occur from time–to–time, but the extent of
this one has puzzled scientists for generations. The
presence of an area of normal stellar density in the ‘eye’
of The Spinner is equally baffling. This has created the
ultimate lure for explorers – a place that is extremely
hard to get to, which may contain something unique.

Attempts have been made to reach and explore The
Spinner for a great many years but the difficulties
are considerable. Smaller rifts along the shortest
route make navigation a problem, whilst the more
roundabout route through Behaypoe must contend
with the presence of a multi-world state located there.
A series of ‘support camps’ was built along the route
but were long ago abandoned. Their fate remains
for the most part unknown and in some cases their
location has been forgotten. Any new expedition must
effectively start from scratch.

The rifts around the ‘eye’ are known to contain high
concentrations of interstellar gas and there are radio-
frequency emissions that suggest multiple black holes.
The Behaypoe people say there is something very
bad contained in the eye and that their gods ate all
the surrounding stars to deny it light. Scientists have
suggested that a multiple supernova event in the
distant past might have disrupted stellar formation and
that some of the gas clouds may be coalescing into
new stars. This would make The Spinner-related rifts
a stellar nursery and an excellent place to study the
phenomena associated with it.

Remote sensing cannot determine what is in the eye,
other than detecting the presence of a dense cluster
of star systems surrounded by zones of decreasing
density. These are for the most part ordinary main
sequence stars. It is not possible to determine the
presence of planets at this distance but it is extremely
unlikely that no system has any planets. There is
no reason to suppose there is anything particularly
unusual on the worlds presumed to exist within the eye,
yet money is available for an expedition there.

It may be that the lure of The Spinner is nothing more
than ‘landmark syndrome’ as explorers call it. No
matter how experienced or sensible a person might
be, a distant object draws attention more strongly than
a blank area on the map. The Spinner has entered
the popular psyche, to the point where most ordinary
citizens of the Confederation who have an interest in
exploration are adamant ‘we will get there one day’
even if they cannot explain why this is so important.

Whilst the specific scientific benefit of an expedition to
The Spinner is debatable, any exploration mission, in
any direction, will inevitably find something new. The
Spinner is something to aim for; a navigational marker
even if it turns out not to be scientifically worthwhile.
There is now also a political factor. Whoever gets
there first will impress a segment of the population
and ‘getting there before the Hivers do’ has somehow
become important to a great many people.

The Spinner has thus taken on a political significance
which is more likely to shake loose money for
exploration and any scientific argument. Private
concerns are also interested, perhaps for scientific

Wonders And Mysteries of the Rim

reasons but possibly as little more than the biggest PR
stunt in human history. It matters little to the crews sent
to drive a route however – they have a budget they
would otherwise not have been granted, and what they
find along the way could be important.

Most of The Spinner-wards activity is methodical and
steady in pace. Mission goals are often quite modest

- a ship might be sent to explore a few worlds on

the projected route before returning to the Xuanzang
Enclave. This sort of work is pretty routine and aimed
at gradually creating a known corridor. Other missions
are aimed at creating good relations with the Behaypoe
people in the hope they can assist.

Most of the state-sponsored exploration work in the
region is associated with this project. Some private and
‘special endeavour’ expeditions have taken a different
approach. In recent years a number of ‘there in one’
missions have staged through Xuanzang, ranging
from a single-ship expedition sponsored by a wealthy
and notorious businessperson to a vastly well-funded
project which declared its intent to create a chain of on-
station supply ships connected by transports.

Some of these expeditions are known to have failed
and others are overdue. It is known that ships have
reached the ‘shore’ of The Spinner rifts but whether
anyone has found a route across to the eye is a
mystery. The leadership of the Xuanzang Enclave
are reluctant to detach ships to go looking for the
missing expeditions, which are generally dismissed
as amateur efforts sponsored by rich fools. Despite
the drain on resources already stretched thin, search
and rescue missions have been launched. Some ships
were located, in varying circumstances. A few had
simply stayed out much longer than planned, to the
annoyance of those sent to find them. Others had run
into technical difficulties. It is claimed that several were
found drifting with combat damage, although there are
no official reports of any such circumstance.

Travellers might get involved in ‘Spinnermania’ in a
variety of ways. They might decide they want to be the
first ones to reach the eye and set out on a seat-of-
the-pants expedition. Alternatively, they may be part of
the official expeditions or support missions, in which
case they will have more backup but less freedom of
action. There are also some questionable political and
economic activities associated with the project and
individuals who place the prestige of getting there first
above the safety of their crews.

THE BEHAYPOE
Little is known about the Behaypoe people and most of
that is classified. It seems they have a multi-world state
in the Behaypoe sector, presumably established by
sublight ships. It is likely the Behaypoe were contacted
during the early attempts to set up supply camps on
the way to The Spinner and that records were lost
or suppressed. Certainly it came as a surprise when
the expedition who thought they were the first contact
team were greeted in Galanglic and invited to a rather
curious version of a cocktail party.

The Behaypoe are known to possess the jump drive
and whilst attempts to examine one have been
fruitless it is almost certain their jump technology is
of human origin. Despite the illegality of transferring
such sensitive technology to an alien civilisatiion,
someone has done so. This may have been a
lost expedition or perhaps humans who felt – for
whatever reason – they could not go home.

The extent of the Behaypoe state is unknown, as is
their system of governance. They are friendly enough
but discourage travel through their territory. They are
also rather vague about exactly what is and what is not
within that territory. Intermittent discussions have taken
place about setting up an official embassy but at some
point in any negotiation the Behaypoe will start asking
if they can please have the secrets of advanced jump
drives. They are not exactly rude about this but seem
obsessed and make it a condition of almost any deal.

Behaypoe technology is thought to be equivalent to
TL10, although they did not develop the jump drive.
Their drives are limited to one parsec and are thought
to be modified and simplified versions of the type in
use during the Rimward 3 period, around 900 to 950.
Sublight ships are thought to be still en route between
the worlds of the Behaypoe polity but it is unlikely
more will be launched now that jump technology is
available. Other than the jump drive, most Behaypoe
technology is quite different to that used by humans.
The commonest material is a plastic-like substance
which can be soft and flexible like cloth or hard and
stiff. It is now known to be of natural origin, although
how it is worked is unknown.

Physically, the Behaypoe are a puzzle. Their society
seems to include two different creatures, although
some scientists think they are related or even that
they could be different castes of the same species in a
similar manner to the way ants have workers, warriors
and queens. The differences between members of
Behaypoe society are far more profound, however.

Wonders And Mysteries of the Rim

TRAVELLER

All interactions between humans and Behaypoe
are carried out by what human researchers call
Behaypoe-C. The C stands for Confirmed in this case,
since this group is confirmed as being sentient and
may be the whole of the Behaypoe species. They are
upright bipeds with a generally insectoid look about
them. Their arms are disproportionately long, ending in
six-fingered hands, and give the Behaypoe-C a rather
delicate appearance. In fact, they mass a little more
than an average human and are physically quite robust.

The Behaypoe-C appear to have vestigial wings
of a shimmering, dragonfly-like nature, placed
rather too high on the rear torso to be practical.
However, these are not wings at all; they are sense
organs. A Behaypoe-C can spread its ‘wings’ to
catch molecules floating on the air and to sense
heat, giving them an ability to smell far outside the
normal sensory range and build a picture of their
surroundings from infrared emissions.

The second group within Behaypoe society is
designated Behaypoe-P, with the P standing for
Possible. These creatures bear a passing resemblance
to Behaypoe-C but are larger and have a different limb
arrangement. They have been described as a ‘hellish
cross between a horse and a caterpillar’, with heads
similar to the Behaypoe-C and similar ‘wings’ on their
backs. It is not known if these creatures are sentient
but they are found in all groups of Behaypoe.

The current working hypothesis is that these are
two genders or castes of a very unusual creature.
The C is thought to be a ‘doer’ caste with the P as
facilitators. However, there are those who suspect
the P type is actually a pet or working animal. It is
known that the P type extrudes a sticky liquid that can
be formed into the ubiquitous ‘Behaypoe-material’
used in construction of everything from starships to
hand tools. How the Behaypoe reproduce is entirely
unknown but if both types are part of the same
species then presumably both are involved.

Behaypoe build cities, which have a curiously organic
look to them and seem to dwell in large cooperative
groups. Beyond that their system of governance is
unknown. Individuals wear what may be insignia
denoting their function in society but could instead
be fashion accessories or commercial merchandise.
The same Behaypoe tend to speak for their people or
the group currently interacting with human explorers,
suggesting some kind of hierarchical system is in place.

It is probable that the Behaypoe are omnivorous but
little can be said with certainty other than that they really
like fruit. Spaces in between their buildings are almost
always given over to orchards or plantations of fruit-
bearing bushes and interactions between Behaypoe
and humans are always characterised by gifts of fruit.
The delight with which the Behaypoe received the first
replies-in-kind has never been surpassed but a basket
of oranges is the only sure way to delay the inevitable
request for an upgraded jump drive.

The military capabilities of this civilisation are probably
not great. There is evidence their vessels carry missile
launchers of some kind and other weapons have been
possibly identified. One ongoing task of diplomatic
missions assigned to the Behaypoe is to determine
if they are a threat. They seem friendly, to the point
where they actually like interacting with humans and
will prolong encounters just to enjoy them. However,
theirs is the largest polity in the vicinity of the
Xuanzang Enclave and as such they might someday
come into conflict with it.

The Behaypoe have not agreed to permanent
diplomatic missions but vessels are stationed on the
(presumed) fringe of their territory to facilitate contact.
Sometimes they invite crews to visit one of their cities
and it is rumoured there is a graveyard dedicated solely
to humans on one of their worlds. It is theorised that
a sizable number of humans once lived among them
and were highly regarded. Perhaps this was a stranded
exploration crew or even survivors of a colony mission.
No humans have been sighted by explorers, however,
and attempts to mimic human cultural behaviours could
stem from distorted memories of long-departed friends.

Travellers can become involved with the Behaypoe in a
variety of ways. They may be assigned to a diplomatic
mission or sent to covertly observe Behaypoe worlds. It
is possible the Travellers might run into a ship or even
a colony far from their territory. Finding out who the
humans who lived among them is a priority for some
researchers, as it may have long-term implications or
at least provide answers to questions about long-lost
missions. There is also the possibility the Behaypoe
might know more about The Spinner than mere folk
tales. Answering these questions is likely to require a
long period of interaction and sooner or later someone
is going to decide that a jointly-crewed mission is a
good way to achieve this.

Wonders And Mysteries of the Rim

POINT CETUS
Roughly 200 parsecs spinward-rimward of the
Xuanzang Enclave, Point Cetus is named for the sea
monster defeated by the legendary hero Perseus.
This is a reference to the location’s importance to
the mysterious Project Perseus. It is possible that
the expedition never happened or was a cover for
something else but Point Cetus definitely exists. It has
been described as the loneliest posting Confederation
personnel will ever be subjected to, lying as it does at
the very edge of the spiral arm some 600 parsecs from
the Confederation border.

The stars do not simply stop at Point Cetus but there
is a sharp drop in stellar density all the way to the
Perseus Arm, a distance of more than 1,500 parsecs.
Just reaching Cetus Station, the last outpost of
humanity, is a journey that would span the career of a
typical naval enlistee from Home. A few people do take
an assignment there, making the trip in a low berth.
This is a one-way ticket into the future, which appeals
to a small minority who have something to leave
behind. More commonly, personnel are assigned from
the Xuanzang Enclave’s population.

Cetus Station is an orbital installation circling a
borderline habitable planet in an average red dwarf star
system. The only remarkable thing about the system
is its location and the presence of [[Terra|Terran]] species on-
planet. These were imported at the start of the project
and are still confined to the area around the surface
settlements, a collection of small towns dedicated to
food production and related industries. Between them
is a mix of farmland and [[Terra|Terran]]-ised wilderness, with

the local ecosystem gradually being pushed back as
the years go by. This is a full-time job, absorbing the
attention of a corps of rangers whose job ranges from
land clearance and forest-planting to driving off local
predators and occasionally acting as police.

Educational standards are good and many locals
go into service aboard the orbital facility and its
associated craft. These are not in a good state,
courtesy of years of chronic under-funding, and
creative solutions have been found to the problems
of maintenance and repairs. The construction ship
sent to set up the first installation broke down many
years ago and was cannibalised into multiple smaller
vessels which conduct running repairs on the station.
Meanwhile a handful of mining vessels obtain raw
materials from around the system and fuel shuttles
skim the system’s gas giants for petrochemicals as
well as hydrogen for fuel.

Cetus Station has its own complement of jump-
capable vessels and even a warship, an extremely
elderly light cruiser of dubious effectiveness. So
far there has been nothing to fight so far out, which
is probably just as well. Ships routinely conduct
exploration missions along the edge of the spiral arm
and back towards the enclaves. This is tailing off,
however, as the distance required to reach new areas
increases and ship serviceability decreases. The
station badly needs a large injection of equipment and
personnel, and faces an uncertain future without it.

The population has grown too large to be easily
evacuated and in any case this is the only home most
of its inhabitants have ever known. There is also the

Wonders And Mysteries of the Rim

TRAVELLER

question of pride and the possibility the installation
might be useful once more. Thus Cetus Station is left
to struggle on with dwindling resources. Ships come
only once every few years and whilst warnings to
prepare for new expeditions usually arrive with them
nothing ever seems to happen.

Travellers could be assigned to a run headed for Cetus
Station or conduct missions out of its limited facilities.
Alternatively, they could become embroiled in a political
or criminal investigation into where supplies meant for
the installation are really ending up. In a higher-level
campaign the Travellers might be assigned what looks
like a prestigious posting to take over the running of
the station. They are then stuck with an endless job
list, a requirement to be ready to support an expedition
that will probably never be launched, and too little to
work with. This would be a challenge for any group of
Travellers, however inventive.

THE MAELSTROM
The Maelstrom can be placed wherever the Referee
wishes, although it will be noticeable from far off.
Travellers could not possibly jump into this location
thinking it was an ordinary star system. The system’s
primary is the supergiant star designated Maelstrom
Alpha, which is closely orbited by the black hole
Maelstrom Beta. The hole tears matter away from
Alpha as it orbits, absorbing most of it and flinging
the remainder in a curving streamer across the
system. Some of this is caught by the system’s
second black hole, designated Maelstrom Gamma,
which orbits the inner pair.

The Maelstrom system no longer has any planets in
stable orbits. The innermost were destroyed by the
supernova events that created both black holes, whilst
outer bodies were perturbed in their orbits and either
fell into the inner system or began the process of
ejection. Currently, the gas giant designated Inbounder
is being stripped of a little more of its atmosphere on
every close pass. It will eventually either be swallowed
up by one of the bodies or accelerated enough to eject
it from the system. It is not clear what the effects of a
gas giant crashing into a supergiant star might be.

The system’s other gas giants will meet a different fate.
The gas giant called Scatter is being ejected from the
system and shedding its moons and rings in a chaotic
manner, resulting in debris fields along its orbit. These
are further perturbed by now rogue moons, which
creates clumps in a few places and elsewhere spreads
the debris out. The outermost gas giant, jokingly known

as Flounce, is departing the system with its moons still
in orbit. There are also two or more terrestrial planets
caught in this maelstrom. There is doubt as to whether
some of them are actually displaced large moons but
Vantage is definitely a planet. It was once an iceball
but has moved into an elliptical and complex orbit that
causes it to warm and cool in a long cycle. Currently,
Vantage is thawing out again.

There is nowhere in the Maelstrom system that is
really safe but Vantage is the best option. It is used by
scientists studying the system, hence its name, and has
a small research installation tunnelled into the rocks
of its highest mountain range. Ships approaching and
leaving are exposed to some hazards, so will often be
provided with a pilot familiar with the local conditions. A
tour of duty as a Vantage pilot is a badge of honour and
a ticket to pretty much any berth the individual wants.

THE TEMPLES OF MAISO
The so-called Temples of Maiso are pyramidal
structures reportedly found on several worlds across
the Rimward Region. They vary in size and shape;
most are simple square-based pyramids but some
have one or more steps between the sloping sections.
Others have a crescent-shaped indentation on one
side. It is not clear if these structures were all built by
the same people, nor is it certain they exist at all. Some
of the ‘pyramids’ spotted from orbit have turned out to
be natural features once excavated, whilst others are
spoil mounds created by primitive cultures.

The discovery of the temples provoked a rash of
wild and often silly connection-making back in the
Confederation. One notorious exponent of secret
histories pointed to the pyramids of Egypt, South
America and Asia and announced the ‘debunking’ of
the long-established principle these were created by
separate cultures and not connected in any way. Since
both stepped and sloped pyramids were proven to
exist in outer space, obviously they were all connected.
Perhaps there was some long-lost branch of humanity
out there, trying to find its way home after some
disaster drove its survivors from their colonies? There
were a few things wrong with this concept but it gained
some traction on the datanets for a while.

Regardless of the nonsense going on back home,
the temples provoked legitimate interest among
explorers. Some sites have been proven to be
unconnected or not even artificial at all, but there is
some evidence that at least a proportion of the sites
are connected. The current working theory is that a
sublight-starfaring culture visited numerous worlds in
Wonders And Mysteries of the Rim

the distant past – at least 100,000 years ago – and
built monuments to its achievements. The presence,
as yet unproven, of species common to the visited
worlds would confirm this theory.

If this is the case then there is a homeworld
somewhere. A hundred thousand years is a long time;
time enough for a civilisation to completely vanish. It
might be that one of the primitive civilisations already
encountered were once the Temple-builders, or that
sublight ships voyage on to this day. The existence
of the Temple-builders is as yet unproven but there is
sufficient interest to keep looking. If their existence can
be proven they will become one of the great mysteries
of modern times and finding them will be prioritised.
Even just picking through the ruins of their ancient
cities might yield a wealth of information.

There are of course those who claim the Temple-
builders have already been found and that information
has been suppressed. Suggested motives range from
simple greed to a noble desire to prevent a gold-rush
of ill-equipped explorers keen to get in on the action.
Expeditions, official and otherwise, have at times been
sent off in a hurry towards an unlikely destination. The
people who outfitted these missions must have had
an objective and the default explanation when nothing
is obvious is that someone has found something that
merits immediate attention. The homeworld of the
Temple-builders is at the top of the candidate list.

THE GREAT STORM
The gas giant Jove Ultra is one of the largest ever
detected. The Referee can place it in any system
desired. Jove Ultra is notable for its immense ring
system and many moons but even more so for the
Great Storm. This is a gigantic clash of thermal bands
in the world’s atmosphere and has been raging for tens
of thousands of years. It creates a gargantuan whirlpool
with an ‘eye’ hundreds of kilometres across. At times, it
is possible for a starship to descend into the eye, taking
advantage of the low gas pressures there and to get
close to the bottom of the storm.

Jove Ultra has a rocky core and a truly immense one at
that. For this reason, it has a higher gravity than a gas
giant of equivalent size would be expected to possess.
The core is seismically and volcanically active, with
huge plumes of magma flung up into the storm and
then whipped around over a vast area. It is thought
this activity is what drives the storm, which seems to
be growing in size and intensity. This in turn generates
heat which bleeds off into colder gas surrounding the
whirlpool and occasionally ignites other storms.

It has been suggested that Jove Ultra may become
so overexcited that nuclear fusion could begin in its
atmosphere. This would not be sustainable; huge as
it is the giant does not have the mass to become a
star. Instead it is expected to become a ‘brown dwarf
with added nuclear explosions’, as one researcher put
it. This is a wholly unique phenomenon and one the

Wonders And Mysteries of the Rim

TRAVELLER

Confederation’s scientists are eager to investigate,
and to this end a small research installation has
been set up on the outermost moon and several craft
assigned to it. Researchers routinely drop probes
into the atmosphere or dive ships as deep as they
dare into areas less turbulent than those surrounding
the Great Storm. Descents into the eye of the storm
require special authorisation and are considered
extremely high-risk operations.

PERPETUAL WAVE
The small terrestrial planet designated HJF-5634789
and otherwise known as High Force appears, at first
glance, to be a typical near-iceball. It has a very thin
atmosphere of carbon dioxide and nitrogen, and a
rotational period of just over nine hours. At night, gases
from the atmosphere freeze out, creating a layer of
solidifying slush over the solid ice. By morning, this slush
has completely frozen but as soon as it receives direct
sunlight the gases begin subliming. This results in what
appears to be a ragged wavefront constantly erupting at
the morning terminator, endlessly around the planet.

There are a few areas where it is reasonably safe to
land, notably in very rocky areas sheltered from the
wavefront. Even so, personnel and vehicles need to be
under cover at daybreak and ships can suffer damage if
poorly positioned. The phenomenon is spectacular but
not particularly interesting from a scientific viewpoint –
sublimation is well understood. What keeps explorers
coming back to High Force is that it is one of the few
confirmed locations of a pyramidal temple and the
only one so far discovered that is not on a world with a
breathable atmosphere.

There are unconfirmed reports that a way has been
found to enter the temple and that researchers are
trying to decipher the writings or carvings found
within. Images of what may be a starmap have
circulated on the shadier parts of the datanet,
although these vary sufficiently that at least some
must be fakes. Typically the maps show the Spinner
and the very obvious radio sources of the Maelstrom
as navigational markers – although the relationship
between these differs from one supposed map
to another. Other points of interest are marked,
including a few gravitational anomalies and radio
sources known to exist, a point thought to be
somewhere in Spinward Marches sector and, in
some cases, Earth.

It is obvious that some of these maps, perhaps all of
them, are fakes. However, it is known that expeditions
have been planned or actually sent to locations that
make no sense if they were not somehow discerned
from a found source. Why would a vessel make a trip of
months or even years to a nondescript main sequence
star when there are so many more like it closer to
base? It may be that the temple at High Force holds the
answers... or maybe just the next set of questions.

DROYNIA NOVA?
On a small, dense-atmosphere world in an unremarkable
star system a billion Droyne lie dead. This raises many
questions. No Droyne settlements are known to exist this
far from Charted Space, although that does not rule out
a lost colony. However, the Droyne of this world appear
to have lived there for a very long time without achieving
more than TL6. Their settlement patterns are indicative
of an indigenous population, with old cities built over and
extended in the characteristic haphazard pattern of a
developing civilisation.

Yet these Droyne are not native to this world. There are
no fossil records – none that have been found, anyway

- and no signs of habitation before around 280,000

years ago. The best guess put forward by researchers
is that this was a refugee colony, perhaps fleeing the
aftermath of the Ancients’ Final War, whose members
ran until their ships broke down around them. Their
resources expended in the flight, they had nothing to
build with and became barbarians within a couple of
generations. In effect, the Droyne of this world are a
transplanted pseudo-indigenous civilisation.

Nicknamed Droynia Nova, this world fascinates
researchers for several reasons. One is the lack of
traditional Droyne art and architecture, which is nearly
identical on all known Droyne worlds. These Droyne
appear to have lost their culture along the way and
evolved a wholly new one. The swirling art patterns
of other Droyne settlements are absent. In their place
are blocky abstract designs not dissimilar to the most
depressing of corporate-approved art and graceful
yet distorted statues which seem to add a tormented
element to even the most beautiful of subjects.

It appears that the Droyne of this world clawed their
way back up from barbarism completely on their own,
experiencing cultural and linguistic drift not seen
elsewhere. Inscriptions have been found that are in a
form of Oynprith – and that itself is strange. Elsewhere
there is only one form of Oynprith; one Droyne
language identical between worlds that have had no
contact in 100 millennia.
Wonders And Mysteries of the Rim

Droynia Nova appears to have thrived since it climbed
out of barbarism. Technology is basic but very well
made, to the point that 100-year-old equipment still
works. A rail-based transport network links the empty
cities, requiring little effort to put back into operation.
Colonisation has been discussed, since there is so
much infrastructure to co-opt. However, that will not
be approved until researchers can determine what
happened on the day everybody died.

As far as can be determined, every single person on
Droynia Nova: an estimated billion or so sophonts, died
more or less simultaneously and by surprise. There is
no evidence of conflict, and people were clearly in the
middle of mundane activities. Everyone just... stopped.
If this is something to do with the planet itself, then
why did it not happen sooner? If it was the Droyne
themselves, what did they do and was it deliberate? If
there was an external cause, what threat does it pose
to humans in the region? Answers are needed but so
far all there are is questions... and corpses.

There is another mystery to be unravelled at Droynia
Nova. Only one traditional ‘Droyne-normal’ statue group
exists. It stands in a courtyard outside what appears

to be a governmental palace and depicts Droyne of
all castes – Workers, Technicians, Warriors, Drones,
Sports and junior Leaders – bowing in adulation to a
larger-than life figure who is presumably a culture hero
or great leader of ancient times. This style of statuary
is not repeated anywhere on the planet and the subject
matter is not repeated anywhere in the cosmos, for the
great leader figure at the centre of the court is human.

Droynia Nova poses so many questions. Why did these
Droyne revere a human as their over-leader? This is
unheard-of in Charted Space. Who was this person?
How did the Droyne get here and are there others?
Are there other humans, for that matter? They would
be descended from Ancients-era humans and quite
different to their modern counterparts. Why and how did
everyone die and were there survivors? The answers to
these questions may be of the utmost importance to the
Confederation, or perhaps just a curiosity for the history
books. Only investigation will reveal the truth and likely
not any time soon.

Wonders And Mysteries of the Rim

There is no single story comprising the ‘Rimward
Campaign’. Instead there are an almost infinite
number of stories revolving around rimward
exploration, any and all of which may influence
the others. The Referee could create a high-level
political campaign set entirely in the Confederation,
with rimward exploration as one of the factors the
Travellers have to deal with. Even if it is not the
focus of the game, the politics of procurement and
budgeting will affect any campaign relying on support
from the Confederation authorities.

Organisations do not provide the wrong equipment
or send it to the wrong recipient because they are
uncaring or stupid – at least, not usually. However,
everyone sees a different picture. Explorers out
on the rim know they need a particular starship or
piece of equipment for a forthcoming expedition.
They request it and months later an approvals board
considers whether the request can be granted.
There are other requirements, just in the field of
exploration, and on top of that the Confederation
needs to defend its borders, secure its interior,
expand its industry and carry out all manner of other
projects. Perhaps the board decides a different
vessel – one that can be cheaply converted from a
retired warship, for example – might suffice.

En route to the expedition jumping-off point the vessel
is short-stopped by a local commander who really
needs an extra hull to salvage a mission which is
going awry. Some conversion is required and also
service for several months. When the requested ship
finally arrives it is the wrong vessel, altered even
further, and months late. The explorers now have a
choice to push ahead with what they have, to make
another equipment request, or to scrap the expedition
entirely. None of this has happened for bad reasons or
because someone did not care about the end mission;
it is a question of priorities at each level of command.

# T HE RIMWARD CAMPAIGN

Travellers might experience this for themselves.
At the beginning of a long campaign they may be
hands-on explorers frustrated at the inability of high
command to send them all 50 all-terrain vehicles
they absolutely need. Twenty years later they are
high-level commanders who would very much like to
send 500 ATVs out to the exploration zone but who
have to fight tooth and nail just to get 10. Depending
on their experiences, they might recall those at the
front line inflating their requirements to account for
being bargained down, or not really understanding
the problems facing those who have to procure
equipment for them.

One likely characteristic of the Rimward Campaign is
a shortage of pretty much everything. The resources
of the Lubbock Enclave, for example, are significant
but they are spread thin by all the tasks facing it.
Supplies and ships must be pushed up the Rimward
Corridor to support long-range exploration. At the
same time the enclave must deal with local problems
and less ambitious exploration... and expand its
capabilities, keep tabs on the activities of the Aslan
and the Minor Races of the region. Occasionally
an initiative generated back in the Confederation
requires a warship to be sent for service with the
fleet, demonstrating loyalty and solidarity to avoid
budget cuts or micromanagement conducted at a
huge distance.

Meanwhile the explorers are being told to do more
with less and are expected to justify their budget by
turning in good results from a critically underfunded
and incorrectly equipped expedition. This may require
taking risks or ignoring guidelines and doing so also
runs the risk of damaging the exploration programme.
Not just by way of the losses incurred but also due to
‘curtailment of recklessness’ and the internal politicking
of those who would prefer some of the budget was
reallocated to their own pet projects.

GUIDELINES
Transiting out to the forward bases will take time – a
great deal of time. Unless the Referee intends to do
some adventuring in the close rimward area, it is better
to start the campaign in the Lubbock or Xuanzang
Enclave. This does limit the species that can be played
if natives of the region are the only options. Virtually
everyone in the enclaves is human, although there are
some populations of local Minor Races who supply
personnel in return for various benefits. Members of
other Major Races are very far from home and will very
much be in the minority.

Non-humans are unlikely to hold high rank. This has
less to do with racism than the reality of conditions
in the enclaves. The humans there come from a
high-tech society, whereas Minor Races tend to be
much less well developed. This makes allied Minor
Races very much junior partners in the enclaves
but respected partners all the same. The occasional
individual will display exceptional talent and rise to the
point where they lead and command humans. This is
rare enough to be remarkable but it is not resented.
Indeed, the Solomani people have a great deal of
respect for anyone who can rise to their level.

The focus of the campaign will more than likely be
exploration but that does not always translate to going
places no-one has ever been. The Travellers might
crew a search and rescue ship, helping out those who
have got into trouble in exciting new places. They might
be an on-site scientific team or a diplomatic mission
assigned to a newly discovered species.

Another possible rimward campaign revolves around
what might be called empire-building. This could
be internal, in the sense of gaining market sector
and control over key industries within areas already
explored – or even within the Confederation’s
exploration-related commercial sectors. Alternatively,
the Travellers might decide to set up a colony of
their own or to support some that have already been
established. It is not hard to obtain official permission
to do such things, so long as the Travellers are willing
to be audited from time–to–ime and to receive liaison
visits from SolSec. The latter are more often helpful
than judgemental, if they feel the endeavour aligns
with the Confederation’s policies and aspirations.

The Travellers could of course go off the books,
perhaps stealing a shipment of colony support
equipment and setting up their own. The Confederation
will come after them and if something goes wrong they
are on their own. This theme might be encountered
from the other side, as explorers stumble over an
apparently friendly colony whose inhabitants would
prefer to remain hidden. There are difficult decisions to
be made under such circumstances.

The most likely theme is a mix of types. The Travellers
may conduct some front-line exploration along with
missions to support other expeditions or colonies,
and occasionally to rescue them from some threat or
mistake. The Travellers may stay a while on a world
to study its inhabitants or to solve its mysteries before
moving on. They may decide to plunge into the region
around the Kruse Enclave or push out to the edge of
the spiral arm. The following sections are campaign
elements that can be used whenever the Referee feels
it is appropriate. Some are obviously tied to certain
locations but can be modified or simply relocated to
wherever the Travellers are operating. Others can be
inserted where they are needed.

ADVENTURES
Much of the time the Travellers will not be interacting
with people outside their expedition. This can limit
the sort of adventures that can be played. Rather
obviously, if the Travellers are on an unexplored
planet hundreds of parsecs from Charted Space they
are unlikely to run into a band of robbers and have a
gunfight. Violent encounters with other explorers or
local hostiles are always possible but for the most part
adventures will not concern clever heists or infiltration
of local criminal organisations.

It is possible to play that sort of adventure within the
enclaves or at one of the colonies, however, and the
occasional change of pace can keep a campaign fresh.
Care must be taken, however, to avoid actions that will
force Travellers to abandon their exploration mission

- unless of course they are out in the wilderness

precisely because they have made themselves
unwelcome in one of the bastions of civilisation. The
Travellers should be able to get away with some low-
level criminality but robbing a major supply cache and
blatantly trying to sell the haul to the people who set it
up will derail a campaign.

###### The rimward Campaign

TRAVELLER

In short, the enclaves are a smaller world and a more
fragile one than the great states of Charted Space.
Doing something bad may endanger a lot of people and
even fairly minor anti-social actions are a problem. The
survival of the enclaves and the success of missions
depends on a generally cooperative society. Those
who go against the grain will stand out and dealing
with them is important to the future of the rimward
exploration project.

For the most part, adventures will take place
away from civilisation and quite possibly with no
other people involved. That means any opposition
will come from the environment or perhaps other
members of the expedition. This does not necessarily
mean malice; incompetence, negligence or simple
mistakes can put the Travellers in danger or set up a
situation where they urgently need to do something
without adequate equipment. If the Referee wants to
use non-player characters in this way, they obviously
must be present. The decision of which characters
to send with the Travellers – if any – needs to be
considered ahead of time.

Interactions with a hostile environment will present
the Travellers with problem-solving opportunities
and are likely to be the main ‘opposition’ they face.
They will also engage in a considerable amount of
investigation, which is made far more interesting if
the Referee can present vivid descriptions of the
wonders they see. These do not have to be strange
alien temples and giant creatures to be interesting;
sunrise on an alien world can be wondrous if the
Referee describes it well.

It is true that most rockball worlds are much the same
but the occasional environmental threat or surprising
anomaly will help to keep things interesting. In the
interim, it is perfectly acceptable to gloss over the most
repetitive parts of exploration work and concentrate on
the out-of-the-ordinary.

The Planetary Environments chapter provides
guidance on the sort of conditions that might
be encountered. This can be used to flesh out
an otherwise humdrum surface expedition or to
create hazards for the Travellers to deal with.
The interactions of pressure – or lack of it – and
temperature, combined with the nature of chemicals
involved can create some interesting and at times
extreme circumstances. This is most of what the
Referee has to work with and if used creatively
can create a fascinating environment with no other
people involved.

Ruins, wrecked starships and alien civilisations will
appear in adventures from time–to–time, but their
presence must always be carefully considered. If
there is a ruined city on a dead planet, it will have
a story and that story is now part of the campaign
universe. A cybernetic death-trap might be fun to
spring on Travellers who have become used to poking
around rockball worlds but it should not be there ‘just
because’. Apart from anything else, the Travellers are
likely to want answers. Searching for them may well
become their new focus.

Ideally, the Travellers will never know if they are about
to embark upon the routine survey of a commonplace
system or if they will stumble across something
highly unusual. A campaign might have a ‘big story’
that gradually emerges – perhaps at first as rumours
and wild tales, then fleeting contacts with unknown
vessels and finally contact with a completely new
starfaring species. In between, the Travellers explore
new worlds. Some of these expeditions are glossed
over as occasions where everything went well, some
are played out. The Travellers may learn clues about
the aliens they will eventually encounter along the
way and if the Referee runs the expedition-adventure
part of the campaign well they will never know how
significant any given world will be until they have
completed their exploration of it.

###### The rimward Campaign

Solomani starship design is heavily influenced by standard Imperial practice – which is
in turn partly derived from [[Terra|Terran]] concepts and partly from the Vilani way of doing things.
However, modern Solomani design philosophy has diverged from the Imperial for various
reasons. Some are practical whilst others are more about ‘not being those damned
Imperials’ than giving any real benefits. A few of the components listed here have near-
identical Imperial equivalents but some are uniquely Solomani in character.

#### HIGH GUARD:

### SOLOMANI

TRAVELLER

DUAL-PURPOSE FUEL/CARGO MODULES (TL8)
Dedicated fuel/cargo modules allow space to be
switched between uses without a lengthy remodelling
of the ship’s interior. Containers include accessways,
hatches and heavy-duty partitions that make them a
part of the ship rather than a component to be added
or removed as necessary. Swapping from fuel tankage
to cargo space requires little more than flushing out
the tanks to ensure no liquid hydrogen remains, then
loading them up with cargo as needed.

Each ton of capacity in a fuel/cargo container requires
0.05 tons of additional equipment and costs Cr5000
per ton. Thus a fuel/cargo container capable of carrying
100 tons consumes 105 tons of displacement and
costs Cr525000. These modules are typically fitted to
support and supply vessels, permitting a ship to make
long transits at need before returning to a transport role
without requiring a refit.

SPACE SCIENCE FACILITY (TL13)
Where Imperial designers prefer separate observatories
and gravitic research centres, Solomani thinking is
directed towards space-efficiency. A space science
facility combines the functions of a basic optical/radio-
observatory and a gravitic sensor suite into a single
complex of instrumentation chambers and working
areas. In addition to its sensor equipment, the facility
also has dedicated computers and conferencing facilities
where scientists can argue loudly then present their
unanimous consensus to the mission commanders.

A space science facility has a minimum size of 250
tons, which is sufficient to support four personnel.
It requires a total of four levels of appropriate skills,
although only one person needs to be a qualified expert
in any given field. Others can be multiskilled personnel,
experts from related fields lowering themselves to
assist, or overworked technicians who do the donkey-
work for their eminent superiors. Appropriate skills are
Science, Investigate, and Electronics (sensors). At least
one level of a relevant Science skill is required.

A space science facility provides DM+2 on Astrogation
checks and Science checks connected with space
sciences. For every additional 25 tons of facilities, one
extra person can work in the space science facility
at any given time. This is important when working on
large projects such as creating an accurate model of
movement for all bodies in solar system or predicting the
likelihood of life-bearing planets in the subsector ahead.

Detection and analysis of objects can be performed
by interception of emissions, analysis of gravitational
phenomena and/or direct observation in the infrared,
visible and ultraviolet wavelengths. For each class of
object there is an automatic detection range. Beyond this
distance, detection requires a Difficult (10+) Electronics
(sensors) check. For each multiple of the automatic
detection distance DM-1 applies, so attempting to detect
planets at 25 light-years is subject to DM-2. Failure
indicates little useful data has been obtained.

A search and plot takes a number of hours equal to 4D
multiplied by the volume in light-years being plotted
or searched. Thus a ship with a gravitational analysis
suite can plot every star for 100 light-years using their
gravitational signature, requiring 4Dx100 hours. A ship
sitting ‘listening’ will automatically detect any jump
emergence within three light-years at the time the
gravity waves reach the analysis suite.

Automatic detection grants an immediate Breakthrough
Index of the appropriate level for that region of space –
typically a starmap hex for most situations – or for that
particular body or jump emergence. Minimal information
in such cases is no more than ‘something came out of
jump... probably’ but of course this data can be refined
and analysed using the Universal Research Mechanic.
Beyond the ‘automatic’ detection range the Universal
Research Mechanic is used to model a search or
detection attempt.

A Space Science Facility costs MCr1.25 per ton. It
consumes 250 tons, plus 25 tons for each additional
personnel. The facility requires 1 Power per 25 tons.

**PLANETARY SCIENCE FACILITY (TL13)**
A planetary science facility focuses on investigations
of terrestrial bodies, gas giants and similar physical
phenomena. It includes extensive survey equipment,
probe launchers and tools for use by scientists on the
surface. These range from delicate instruments to
pulse-laser drills designed to rip rock samples out of a
body as quickly as possible. Well-equipped laboratories
and specialised computing suites are optimised for
analysis work. Overall, the facility provides DM+2 when
conducting planetary science operations.

The planetary science facility can help predict the
general composition of a body by remote sensing or
estimate it in more detail if direct samples are available.
A thorough survey of a cometary body using drones,
probes and standoff sensor packages does not take
all that long but the time required increases greatly for
larger bodies. Multiply the time taken by 10 per Size
code. This represents a great deal of effort but at the
end the operators will know everything there is to know
about the body in question.

A survey carried out using a planetary science facility
permits an Average (8+) Science check to be made
every hour for small bodies like comets and at intervals
of 24 hours per Size for planets. Negative or zero Effect
means that nothing has been learned. Any positive
Effect is added to the Breakthrough Index for that body.
Base BI in this case starts at 1, since it is not possible
to survey a body the operators do not know is there.

A planetary science facility consumes 50 tons and
can support four personnel. Each additional 10 tons
of equipment can support one additional researcher.
The facility costs MCr0.5 per ton and Power
requirement is 1 per 10 tons.

**LIFE SCIENCE FACILITY (TL13)**
Inevitably referred to as a ‘medlab’ for ancient cultural
reasons, a life science facility is optimised for the study
of biology, biochemistry, exobiology and related fields. It
can also serve as a medical facility at need, with space
for four patients without any need for rearrangement
of equipment. Work in related fields, including medical
treatment, receives DM+2 from the life science facility.

Study of a specific subject, such as attempts to analyse
and cure an epidemic or figure out how a strange
alien creature works, takes a variable amount of
time depending on the Referee’s assessment of the
situation. At each interval the lead researcher on the
project can make a relevant Average (8+) skill check.
The Effect is added to the BI for the subject, starting at
a base of 1 if little or nothing is already known.

Analysis of a simple creature will take place at
intervals of one hour, increasing to several times this
for a complex one or a small ecosystem. Learning all
about a planet’s biosphere will take much longer. As
a rule of thumb, three hours per point of Atmosphere
plus Hydrographics is required per check. This can
be longer in the case of extremely complex or exotic
ecosystems and diseases. In some cases there may
be surprises along the way. For example, the Referee
might decide that a very unusual life form will not be
discovered or will be mistaken for something harmless
until BI reaches a certain threshold or it eats one
of the explorers. If the Travellers stop investigating
before reaching this threshold they may never discover
the creature. This is how worlds get filed as ‘lifeless
rockball’ and later turn out to have dangerous life of an
unusual sort.

A life science facility consumes 35 tons and can
support four personnel. Each additional five tons of
equipment can support one additional researcher or
four patients. The facility costs MCr1 per ton and Power
requirement is 1 per 10 tons or part thereof.

RESEARCH SCOOP (TL9)
A research scoop uses a physical mechanism to collect
atmospheric gas from terrestrial and giant planets, and
an electromagnetic field to draw in interplanetary or
interstellar gas. Attempting to refuel a ship this way is
inefficient but a scoop can be used to collect samples
for analysis that might provide an insight into system or
star formation and ancient events such as supernovae
in the region. The scoop only works when the vessel is
skimming an atmosphere or in motion in normal space

- not in jumpspace. In deep space it typically collects

only a few molecules every hour. Some extremely
long duration colonisation missions may have used
this system to replenish power plant fuel, although that
would require a much larger scoop.

A research scoop uses 1 Power, consumes 10 tons and
costs MCr1.

A scoop also used for refuelling must be tailored to the
tonnage of the parent vessel to be effective, requiring
one ton of equipment per 200 tons of the vessel, plus
an additional 40 tons for the central capture and field
generation unit. It requires 1 Power to operate per ton
and costs Cr50000 per ton.

ACCOMMODATION BLOCK
Some Solomani exploration ships employ small
accommodation blocks to provide minimal living space
for the crew of a vessel or craft. Such blocks are not
suitable for long deployments unless the ship has lavish

###### High Guard: Solomanii

TRAVELLER

recreation spaces but they are useful aboard small craft
that might have to stay out for a few days, or to allow
a few extra personnel to be crammed into a vessel at
need. The accommodation block contains two racks
of three bunks, minimal storage space for personal
effects, a fresher and a mini-galley, plus a ‘utility and
recreation’ space separated from the sleeping area by
a simple sliding door.

With ‘hot bunking’ – sleeping in shifts – a single
accommodation block can accommodate 12 or even
more personnel in the short term. A few days of
this, even aboard a small craft with little space to do
anything, is not particularly harmful. In the long term,
personnel will be fatigued or even suffer mental health
issues unless they can get out and move around. This
might be working in less cramped areas of a ship, or
outside a landed small craft serving as a surface base.

The accommodation block is disaster-proofed as far
as possible. Its surrounding bulkhead is of a standard
equivalent to starship internal components and the life
support system can be isolated from the rest of a vessel.
It will run on its own batteries for a week or more, even
if the block is at capacity and for longer with a lower
capacity. The outer door also has an emergency airlock
system. This is a flexible plastic ‘framed bag’, and not
very durable, but can serve in an emergency. It deploys
inward, protected by the bulkhead-standard outer door,
and takes up a significant proportion of the available
space. An accommodation block consumes six tons and
costs MCr2.

EXCURSION BAYS
An excursion bay is designed to allow safe access to
the external environment, whether that is space, an
airless world’s surface or the parking area of a starport.
The bay is designed for decontamination, maintenance
and preparation of equipment as well as access to
the ship, and has security features making it suitable
for commercial ships as well as exploration vessels. A
personnel excursion bay has a small workshop area
for maintenance of vacc suits and hostile environment
gear, whilst a vehicular excursion bay includes the
same but adds vehicle maintenance facilities as well.

An excursion bay uses an airlocked entrance/exit
point which is fitted with basic weapon scanners
and analysis equipment that can spot most harmful
organisms or substances. The airlocked area can
be decontaminated in a routine manner but also has
an emergency purge facility. Some versions of the
excursion bay, designed to be used in an extreme-
hazard environment, permit cryogenic flooding,
radiation sterilisation and thermal destruction of
anything within the airlocked area. This feature is not
normally fitted to prevent the system being used as a
death trap by unscrupulous operators. The inner area
can also be decontaminated, either along with the
airlock or separately. Vehicles carried in an excursion
bay consume tonnage based on their Shipping value.

Excursion bays have an Access and Support rating.
One point of Access or Support translates to a single
person in a hostile environment suit or combat armour,
or two in ordinary vacc suits. Thus an excursion
bay with Access 4 can allow up to eight vacc-suited

###### High Guard: Solomanii

personnel access, or two in hostile environment suits
and four in vacc suits, or any combination thereof.
Support indicates the number of sets of equipment that
can be cared for and assumes space for one technician
to work for every four points of Support.

Vehicular excursion bays can support and maintain a
shipping tonnage of vehicles up to their Support rating
and accommodate a vehicle up to its Access rating in
shipping tons. A vehicular excursion bay can of course
deploy personnel through its airlock but is not optimised
to maintain their equipment. Additional vehicles can be
stowed in cargo space set up as garages, accessing
the ship through the excursion bay.

A personnel excursion bay consumes a minimum of
four tons. This gives Access 2 and Support 4. Each
additional ton can be used to add Access +1 Support
+2. A personnel excursion bay costs MCr0.5 per ton.

A vehicular excursion bay consumes a minimum of
12 tons. This gives Access 4 and Support 8. Adding
Access +1 or Support +2 points consumes an
additional two tons.

A vehicular excursion bay costs MCr0.75 per ton.

PROBES AND PROBE OPERATIONS
Remote sensor operations and routine monitoring
permit a small party of explorers to cover a wide area.
The Confederation uses two sizes of probe, with
different payloads depending on the mission at hand.
Both consist of a bus section containing the propulsion
mechanism, a guidance section and a payload bay
which will usually carry sensors. In theory, a standard
TL12 probe could be launched to any target in the
same star system or even into interstellar space.
Running on minimal power, it would in all likelihood
eventually arrive. However, this sort of exploration of a
solar system is rather inefficient and time-consuming,
so probes are normally launched from ships or craft
passing close to a body.

The probes used by the Confederation are normally
inexpensive TL12 designs, although it is always possible
to create specialist variants. Large payloads require
a large probe to carry them and large probes can
alternatively carry up to three small payloads. A small
probe can only carry one small payload. Large probes
can also be deployed from standard torpedo launchers,
whilst small probes can be deployed from missile racks.

When stowed, three large probes consume one ton of
cargo space. Twelve small probes consume one ton.

Orbital Instrument
Package

Cr50000 Small A package of optical and thermal sensors plus receivers for
radio-frequency emissions and those associated with power
generation or vehicles. Designed to remain in low orbit for a
time before entering atmosphere. Probe duration is a number of
days equal to 2D+2 minus the world’s Atmosphere code.

Instrument Package

Cr125000 Small As above but the package is more ‘stealthy’ and unlikely to be

Atmospheric
Sampler

Cr25000 Small An atmospheric sampler probe is designed to skim gases
from the upper atmosphere and launch samples aboard
tiny capsules back to a small craft in orbit. Samplers can be
used in any atmosphere but are primarily intended to avoid
endangering a craft by entering a turbulent or potentially
dangerous atmosphere.
Reconnaissance
and Surveillance

Cr200000 Large A larger version of the orbital instrument package designed to
remain in orbit for an extended period. Life span of the probe is
typically 2D years if well placed.
Communications Cr140000 Large A short-term communications relay satellite rather than a probe.
One of these devices will allow communications between widely
separated ground installations or parties. A constellation of
five provides complete communications coverage. Life span is
typically 2Dx5 years.
Surface Sampler Cr250000 Large A surface sampler is designed to land in water or on land and to
collect nearby samples. Whilst sometimes a little random, this
can allow a dangerous area to be sampled without risk to the
craft. Basic analysis can be done inside the probe, after which
samples are launched in small capsules for collection in orbit.

TORPEDO GRAPPLE (TL9)
The ability to launch torpedoes from small craft gives
them effective striking power against larger vessels,
albeit at horrific risk. Using such weapons from utility
craft would be an act of desperation in Charted Space
but out on the rim even a little 25-ton utility boat can
be a potent force against many potential opponents.
All the same, torpedo grapples are more useful to
explorers as probe-carriers. The standard external
grapple can carry two large probes or six small
ones on a disposable multi-mount. Probes cannot
be recovered to a grapple once launched, although
unused probes can be manually demounted for
deployment elsewhere. A grapple uses one firmpoint
and costs MCr0.1, plus the cost of munitions. One
standard torpedo costs Cr150000.

###### High Guard: Solomanii

Many of the vessels used for exploration by the Solomani Confederation are repurposed naval vessels, especially
in the regions close to the Confederation or one of its forward bases. For longer-range operations, specialist
vessels are preferred. By preference these are built to TL14 standards for starships but such vessels can only
be constructed in a few yards. TL12 or TL13 vessels are common, especially among those intended for use far
beyond the frontiers where spares will be difficult to obtain.

The exception is jump drives. These are constructed off-site and added to a vessel on a modular basis. Even at
the far forward bases, there are stockpiles of complete drives in standard sizes and large stocks of components
to maintain them. Maintaining these stocks is a laborious process but one considered absolutely necessary to
conducting a proper exploration capability or even just sustaining the Solomani presence so far from home.

Small craft tend to be the same as those used in the Confederation, although variants are used which would not
be encountered at home. Almost all craft conform to the ‘25/75’ Confederation standard which permits them to fit in
the hangars and bays of almost any vessel. A surprisingly large percentage of these craft are exactly the same as
back home – ports and starships need shuttles and utility craft out on the rim just as in the Confederation. However,
there are some variant models in use and a few craft that have been developed specifically for the needs of a
particular mission or base.

### SOLOMANI EXPLORATION

### SHIPS AND CRAFT

The UB-25 (Utility Boat, 25 tons) is a common
small craft throughout the Confederation and
everywhere its ships operate. It is built on a
flattened cylinder design, conventionally laid out
with drives and power plant aft and the cockpit
forward. The space between is configured as
necessary. For boats serving in the passenger/light
transport role, reconfiguration is normally a matter
of removing detachable seats or adding more, with
stocks of modular equipment available at most
ports. Specialist variants are usually configured at
construction and require a shipyard to alter.

The exploration variant of the UB-25 varies from
standard in that it has a much larger fuel capacity
and a rather minimal personnel accommodation
area. This craft is sometimes used to carry out orbital
surveys or sensor flybys of bodies in space but can
also serve as a surface exploration base for a small
team. Conditions aboard are horribly cramped but as
a place to work out of for a few days the UB-25EV
will suffice. A torpedo grapple is fitted as standard,
allowing these boats to join a battle against some
minor local foe but far more commonly the device is
used to carry probes for a survey mission.

LARGE UTILITY BOAT, EXPLORATION VARIANT **TYPE: UB-75EV**

The UB-75 is built on the same flattened-cylinder
hull design as its smaller cousin and is similar in
performance. It is normally set up as a cargo shuttle with
space for a handful of rather cramped passengers. The
vessel can be run by a single pilot but normally carries a
technician/co-pilot and some additional personnel. The
UB-75EV modification can be encountered in a variety
of roles ranging from search and rescue to acting as a
surface exploration base.

The standard UB-75 carries a laser turret along
with a pair of container-launchers for standard
missiles. The exploration variant omits the latter
and ships a missile rack instead of the laser. This
is sufficient to pose a real threat to primitive space
vessels but is more commonly used to deliver small

probes. The vessel’s inability to handle large probes
has attracted some adverse comment but this is
offset by the launch system’s capacity for multiple
deployments and greater convenience than the
grapple system used by the UB-25.

Much of the UB-75EV’s cargo space is converted into
an exploration working area. This consists of a small
combination workshop/laboratory and a secure storage
area which can be used for weapons but usually also
contains tools and samples. 12 tons of cabin space is
allocated to this working area and cannot be used for
cargo without greatly inconveniencing the crew. The
vessel retains 22 tons of cargo capacity unless this has
been reconfigured and can support a crew of four to
six for an extended deployment.

The Cimarron-class is built on a non-jump-capable
version of the standard ‘Modulus Four’ hull. This 1,000-
ton streamlined cylinder is used for vessels ranging
from patrol craft to transports and also in a range of
specialist applications. The Cimarron-class is one of
those, tirelessly keeping exploration ships and bases
supplied with fuel. Carried aboard a larger vessel, it
can function as a detachable fuel tank, breaking off to
carry out skimming operations and returning before the
parent vessel jumps to the next system.

Although several classes share the same hull,
configuration is determined at fitting-out and cannot
be changed without a major rebuild. In the case of
the Cimarron-class, all inhabited parts of the vessel
are right aft. The bridge adjoins the engineering
spaces and contains a gunnery control station, with
personnel accommodation forward of this. A small
cargo hold separates the inhabited section from the
fuel tanks and skimming apparatus, which fulfil the
vessel’s primary function. Other than maintenance
and damage-control operations, the crew rarely
venture forward and the accessways to the forward
weapons mounts are almost never used.

SUPPORT VESSEL **TYPE: CIMARRON**

The Cimarron is used by the Confederation Navy and
Home Forces, and as such a light armament is deemed
necessary for self-defence. A pair of missile barbettes
provide standoff combat capability, located close to the
inhabited section to allow personnel to service missiles
or troubleshoot the autoloading mechanism. Two laser
turrets, located forward, and the point defence system
are all remotely controlled under normal circumstances.

Utilitarian as it may be, a Cimarron is a technological
marvel to most rimward societies that see one. Its sleek
lines and incredible acceleration – by local standards –
will not fail to impress. Enterprising exploration captains
have occasionally awed a newly contacted species by
deploying a ‘fleet of destroyers’ consisting of fuellers and
transports. A Cimarron once fought a war – and won it –
against a new-spacefaring civilisation. However, for the
most part fuel skimming is one of the least glamourous of
all possible assignments.

Standard crew for a Cimarron operating from a base or
parent ship is a pilot/commander and three engineer/
technicians, plus gunners. Four are normally carried,
acting as additional technicians and general maintenance
personnel when not operating their weapons.

The Mauritius-class is built on the same Modulus Four
hull as many other Confederation designs but is fitted
out quite differently. The vessel is intended for local
exploration operations rather than long transits and
will normally spend considerable time in a system
undertaking a thorough exploration before moving on.
Similar armament is shipped as other vessels built on
the same hull, although the barbettes are more likely
to be used to deploy probes than deadly munitions.

The Mauritius-class is laid out differently to most
sublight vessels built on the same hull. Drives and
engineering spaces are aft, with accommodation and
common areas in front. The bridge and command
spaces are forward, with the small craft bays in
between. Four 25-ton subordinate craft can be carried,
with two at any time in full hangars where maintenance
is conducted. Since the Mauritius-class can land on a
planetary surface, the hangars and bays may be used
for equipment and vehicles on some occasions.

LIGHT EXPLORATION VESSEL **TYPE: MAURITIUS**

The cargo bay is designed to be repurposed and
most examples of this class have been modified
to a greater or lesser degree. Additional research
equipment, training facilities, workshops, medical
bays and almost anything else can be retrofitted.
One common modification is to add several more
cabins and working/training/recreation spaces to
go with them. This can reduce crew burnout on a
long deployment even if it makes the vessel less
efficient in other ways.

As with many smaller ships, crewing is a balance
between expertise and flexibility. The standard crew
is composed of a captain/astrogator, executive
officer, chief pilot, six engineer/technicians and
12 other personnel, including a sufficient number
who can either fly a small craft or operate weapon
systems. These personnel fill in other roles
according to their additional skills.

The Tenzing-class is a top-end exploration ship,
although not a particularly large one. It is named
for those who supported more famous explorers,
such as the navigators and engineers of famous
exploration ships or – as is the case with the class
namesake – local experts and guides who facilitated
famous exploits but often got little credit. The
Tenzing-class was designed to be the equivalent
of the sailing caravel in the great days of [[Terra|Terran]]
exploration; easy for a small crew to handle but
sufficient to undertake a lengthy cruise.

The Tenzing-class is built to TL14 standards on a
custom 2,000-ton hull intended to be able to make
repeated planetary landings and act as a mobile
exploration base. The space saved by not carrying
hangars full of craft was considered extremely
valuable in such a small vessel. Overall hull form is
a ‘flared cylinder’ shape not dissimilar to some other
Solomani designs. Most systems are contained
within the main cylinder, with the wide aft section
containing jump drive fuel. The main cylinder is
distinctly divided, with the upper deck reserved
for ship operations and the lower deck set up in a
manner that allows it to be readily customised.

The aft part of the main hull is largely taken up with
a four-parsec jump drive and a surprisingly modest
power plant. The Tenzing-class can operate in-
system using its power plant but requires battery
power to keep all systems running whilst charging
the jump drive. It is common to shut down the
manoeuvre drive and observe strict power-regulation
measures during the pre-jump sequence, making this
one of the few Solomani designs whose crews may
have to observe the old tradition of ‘jump dimming’.

Crew accommodation and associated systems
are located amidships, with a command area
immediately forward of them. This contains briefing
rooms, training facilities and the main computer core,
but not the bridge; that is located in a dorsal hump
which also contains the drone handling rooms and
the missile system. Forward in the main cylinder is
the scientific suite, with laboratories and operating
stations for major instruments such as the life and
deep penetration scanners. A curious feature of the
Tenzing-class is the emergency conning position, in
the form of a two-seat cockpit protruding from the
front face of the upper deck.

At the fore end of the lower deck is an extensive
excursion suite, with personnel and vehicle
access. The Tenzing-class has the capacity for

up to nine standard ATVs or an array of smaller
vehicles and usually carries significant hostile
environment gear. Aft of the vehicle bays are
crew recreation areas, a configurable biosphere,
the small cargo hold and chambers containing
electronic systems that require little maintenance.
As is not uncommon on ships of this type, crew
recreation areas are designed to be repurposed as
additional working spaces when necessary.

Although armed, the Tenzing-class was never
envisaged as a warship. Nonetheless, its lightly
armoured hull and main battery of particle barbettes
does enable it to be used as a high-jump patrol
vessel for regions of sparse star systems. In addition
to two missile barbettes, which are intended as probe
launchers more than weapon systems, the ship
mounts a main battery of four particle barbettes, all
on the dorsal surface aft of the bridge, and eight dual
laser turrets positioned at intervals across the hull.

The Tenzing-class can carry enough personnel
to fill its ‘textbook’ roster without using double-
occupancy in its crew staterooms but adding
mission specialist personnel pushes this limit.
This is rarely a problem, as exploration ships
are unlikely to need a full-time complement of
gunners; indeed, it is rare to encounter a Tenzing
with more than one or two gunnery personnel. At
need, multiskilled personnel can man the weapons,
carrying out their normal duties the rest of the time.
Likewise, the engineering workload is normally
handled by around six full-time engineering and
maintenance personnel, with additional personnel
re-tasked when needed. The typical crew of a
Tenzing looks nothing like its ‘paper’ complement.

A typical exploration crew consists of a few high-
capability experts plus a much larger number
of multiskilled personnel. Nominal complement
is around 27, plus mission specialists and their
support personnel. However, most mission support
personnel and some specialists are trained to handle
shipboard tasks as well, creating a multiskilled crew
that can swap personnel between roles. Other than
some high-end scientists, nobody serves aboard an
exploration ship without being qualified to fulfil some
important shipboard role to at least a basic level.
Likewise, backup personnel are distributed among
the crew. Thus whilst there is a senior astrogator
aboard, there will be at least two other people
capable of calculating a jump plot.

The Michigan-class began its long career well over
a century ago with a memorandum of requirements
for a light carrier capable of undertaking raids into
enemy territory. A collision of agendas resulted in
an unusually long development time and several
reversals of decision. The new class was to be
capable of operating without logistics support
ships, then that requirement was dropped after the
proposal for a new fast fleet auxiliary found favour.
The failure of that class to emerge from the drawing
board left the Michigan without the means to refuel
itself in enemy territory. This necessitated a return to
the ‘self-sustaining raider’ concept, which at the time
did not appeal to military planners. The project was
put on the back burner.

After the fall of Terra, the idea of a warship that
could maraud around the enemy’s rear area for an
extended period, exacting retribution wherever it
went, was suddenly back on the table. Influential
figures began pushing for construction to begin.
Predictably, the Michigan-class went into production
with several important design questions unresolved.
The inauguration ceremony, replete with triumphant
vids of raider-carriers replenishing their small craft
complement by raiding enemy installations for
fighters, promised great things. In the end, however,
the original Michigan-class was a confused design
beset by compromise and a lack of direction.

As with many projects of political interest, large
numbers were ordered before reality set in, leaving
the project’s backers with the unenviable task
of choosing between admitting their mistakes or
saddling the navy with a less than ideal starship.
Naturally, saving face was more important than
ensuring the navy got best value for budget Credits
and the construction orders went ahead. As the first
batches of Michigans entered service in the mid-
1010s, their shortcomings were readily apparent.
However, it was the frightening time just after the
Solomani Rim War, when a renewal of hostilities
was a serious prospect.

The Michigan-class actually gave good service in
those years, presenting a ‘fierce face’ to the Imperials
along the border and strengthening the internal
security of the Confederation. Early-build examples
were transferred to the Home Forces or modified to fit
various specialist roles, whilst Block 2 and later orders
incorporated lessons learned with the first batch.
Many of the earliest Michigans were sent rimward
to operate in the relatively low-threat environment
just beyond the Confederation border. The move
to exploration work was a natural one, although it

necessitated further modifications. Today’s explorer-
Michigans are recognisable as those befuddled
first examples, just about, but they carry a weight of
experience few more recent classes can match.

The modern Michigan-class is designed for
operations outside the Confederation frontier,
including patrol, security and diplomatic work close
to the frontiers and dedicated exploration beyond. It
carries a light missile armament for standoff combat
or to support its craft, with plasma barbettes to deal
with smaller vessels that get too close. The laser
armament is grouped as 20 batteries of three turrets
and is primarily intended for fighter or missile defence,
backed up by a layered point defence system.

Some of the original design’s craft capacity has been
traded for extended range. Internal fuel tankage is
sufficient for a three-parsec jump with sufficient in
reserve for a single parsec jump further if necessary.
Four 1,000-ton subordinate craft are carried in place
of the original 25-ton vessels. Depending on the
mission, two to four of these may be fuel/support
variants of the Cimarron-class, with others as jump-
capable ships for local exploration. A capacity of 28
25-ton craft is retained, of which four boats can be
maintained in their hangars at any one time.

The Michigan-class carries a full set of space,
planetary and life science facilities, the latter of
which can double as a hospital at need. Very little
internal space remains unallocated, so often the
holds of subordinate craft are used or some are
omitted to make space for necessary cargo. There is
a fair amount of recreation and general-work space
which could be repurposed but whenever this has
been done it has produced a sharp drop in ship
efficiency on an extended cruise.

Nominal crew is around 150, plus mission personnel
and scientists. Aboard a dedicated warship, gunners
would be specialists but weapons are rarely needed
on an exploration mission. A few specialist gunnery
personnel are carried but most are multi-skilled and
assist with maintenance or small-craft support. Large
numbers of small-craft pilots are needed, with many
doubling up as technicians. A front-line carrier would
have a complement of fighter jocks who did little else
but an exploration mission needs greater overall
flexibility even if it comes at the cost of efficiency.
There is always multiple redundancy among an
exploration crew; a ship whose only astrogator suffers
an accident 200 parsecs from home is lost for certain.
For this reason, the crew complement given here is
merely a general indicator of what is needed.

The hull is rugged and lightly armoured as standard.
This is primarily to provide protection against
micrometeorites and the general abuse vehicles
of this sort suffer. FAMAT-12 vehicles intended for
security operations are often up-armoured, with
panels and inserts added on the sides, and protection
increased for windscreens and vision ports. Armour
from the roof can be moved to other locations in a
matter of hours using brackets and standard-sized
panels, or additional panels can be added whilst
retaining some or all of the heavy top cover.

The FAMAT-12s used on most exploration missions
have a standard configuration forward section and
a rear section set up for exploration-related tasks.
The forward section contains driving and co-driving
positions, with two additional crew or passenger
seats behind them. These can be rotated to face
in any direction and workstations are provided to
allow these personnel to assist with navigation,
communication or mission-related tasks. Immediately
behind what is universally known as the cab is
the living space, consisting of a pair of bunks and
a fresher on one side of the vehicle and a galley
plus another pair of bunks on the other. Nominal
crew capacity is four in this section of the vehicle,
although up to four other personnel may be using the
bunks, cooking, in the fresher or moving in and out of
the rear section of the vehicle.

The rear section of the vehicle contains a working
area normally set up as a command and coordination
centre. It can be reconfigured if necessary, providing
additional processing capacity for the laboratories or
other mission-related tasks. The vehicle’s computer
core is also located here. The rest of the rear section
is taken up with a general-purpose laboratory
and four specialised laboratory stations. These

FAMAT-12 ALL-TERRAIN VEHICLE

The Solomani Confederation has a preference for families of vehicles using common components rather than
custom designs for any given role. The result is more vehicles for the same amount of budget Credits but at the
cost of top-end efficiency. Ground vehicles are preferred for day-to-day exploration work, partly for cost reasons
and partly because ground flown over is not really ground explored.

# S EXPLORATION VEHICLES

## OLOMANI

The FAMAT-12 is the largest chassis in the FAMily of
All-Terrain vehicles series. The design concept dates
back centuries, to a requirement for a standardised
‘family’ of vehicles with interchangeable components
and standardised controls. The FAMAT-12 is typically
outfitted as an exploration or ‘frontier utility’ vehicle,
serving as a platform for all manner of work with
prospecting and mineral-resource companies, colonial
expeditions and the like. It is also pressed into service
as a security vehicle and can sometimes be found
at backwater starports where an environmentally
controlled platform is necessary to security operations.
The FAMAT-12 is also used, in modified form, as
a weapons carrier or personnel transport by some
mercenary units. It is built under license on a great
many Solomani worlds and has been widely copied –
usually without a license – elsewhere.

Rather than the typical single-hull system used by
most all-terrain vehicles the FAMAT-12 is built in two
sections joined by a flexible connector. Each section
has six powered and independently steerable wheels,
making the FAMAT-12 extremely manoeuvrable
for its size but tricky to drive without full automated
assistance. Even then, the driver has to remain aware
of where each part of the vehicle is going; it is quite
possible to jam a FAMAT-12 against obstacles a
conventional vehicle would not strike.

The two-section design has many advantages. A
FAMAT-12 can quickly be repurposed by replacing the
rear section and since the two parts can be sealed off
from one another, a puncture in one – perhaps from a
micrometeorite strike – will not depressurise the whole
vehicle. Indeed, it is not uncommon to find explorers
working out of a depressurised rear section whilst the
‘drive crew’ operate in a shirtsleeves environment in the
forward compartment.

are usually configured for life sciences, space or
planetary sciences, physical sciences and whatever
project the vehicle is currently engaged in. The
airlock is at the rear of the vehicle.

This rear section of the vehicle is nominally rated for
up to seven personnel – two in the command centre
and five using the laboratory spaces. This makes a
nominal crew of 11, but it is more common to run with
eight in order to rotate use of the bunks and reduce
cramping in the rear section. No armament is fitted
to the standard FAMAT-12 but both compartments
have ring mounts accessed via a top hatch. These
mounts are sometimes used for light support
weapons but may also carry instruments or additional
communications gear. Militarised FAMAT-12 vehicles
typically use a rear section mounting a rotating
turret, whilst specialist versions may carry a crane or
earthmoving equipment on the rear section, often in
an unpressurised or open mounting.

famat–12 All–Terrain vehicle

The FAMAT-4 is the smallest vehicle in the family that
is in mass production. A few ‘cousin’ designs have
been manufactured in limited numbers for specialist
purposes but these are not economical for widespread
use. As the name suggests, FAMAT-4 is a four-wheel
design whose general styling and use of common
components identifies its relationship with its larger
stable-mates. Where larger vehicles are intended for
long-term operations, the FAMAT-4 is a short-range
workhorse. Occasionally a group of ‘4s’ will accompany
a larger ATV which acts as a base and place for crews
to rest. Expeditions of this sort have slogged their way
across the surface of many a world.

A number of variants are built on a standard chassis,
with the open-backed version being most common.
This has a two-person cab with an airlock and minimal
support facilities. The rear of the vehicle is flat, with
fold-down sides and tailgate to allow loose cargo
to be carried. There are also mounting points for
machinery, enabling the vehicle to be used as anything
from a crane to a mobile telescopic observatory. One
common, but unpopular, configuration has two rows
of bench-type outward-facing seats. These allow up
to six personnel to be driven around a work site in
modest discomfort. Life support plugs allow vacc-
suited personnel to extend their time in the field whilst
being transported – this is the primary reason for most
personnel to dislike the FAMAT-4.

Like other members of the family, the ‘4’ has light
armour over its cab and critical machinery, with an
emphasis on top cover for micrometeorite protection.
This can be augmented with bolt-on panels but they
are rarely used as they overload the vehicle and
make it a little top-heavy. The flatbed area can be
used to mount a weapon, typically a light autocannon
or laser, for air defence or to eliminate primitive
vehicles in a situation where contact and liaison
operations have not gone according to plan.

OUTRIDER GRAV PLATFORM

The Outrider falls somewhere between grav bike and
grav sled. It is a semi-open-frame vehicle ridden by a
single crewmember, with a wide platform behind the
rider which can be used for a variety of purposes. The
rider sits astride the vehicle, protected at the front by
a streamlined fairing. A life-support system fitted to
the vehicle allows the driver to plug in a vacc suit for
effectively unlimited endurance, although remaining
sealed in a suit for long periods is unpleasant at best.

Behind the rider is a configurable platform equivalent
to four Spaces, with a removable front fairing and
rear spoiler. With these in place the vehicle is capable
of extremely high speeds in an atmosphere but are
sometimes removed to allow an alternate configuration
to be put in place. The standardised fittings used to
secure cargo to the platform can also mount weapons,
instruments or open seats for up to four passengers.
These also have the plug-in life support function.

An enclosed box-superstructure can be mounted on
the platform, breaking up the streamlining and lowering
Speed to Fast (High). The superstructure can be used
to carry equipment such as a mobile laboratory or a
tiny living space to permit crews working outside to
obtain some relief. For field work on vacuum worlds two
grav platforms can be landed side–by–side and their
superstructures connected with a flexible tube. This
allows the creation of a tiny base; one superstructure
contains an airlock and galley, the other a fresher and
bunkroom. Vacc suit and equipment maintenance
loadouts are also possible.

In military or paramilitary use a small weapon can be
carried on a ring mount and operated by a gunner on
the platform, or on a fixed mount firing through a port in
the forward airing. A turreted weapon could be carried
on the platform, but this configuration is rare; there are
cheaper weapons carriers with similar capabilities.

CHIPMUNK PERSONAL TRANSPORT

The Chipmunk is a common utility vehicle, designed to
carry the operator and a small amount of equipment.
It is somewhere between a motor trike and a light grav
vehicle in concept, with three big balloon tyres and an
auxiliary grav lifter unit. The ride is notoriously bouncy,
which amuses many operators and makes others sick.
Skilled operators typically make use of the grav-jump
feature as much as possible, finely playing the controls
to provide attitude control whilst in the air. This can
go badly wrong, as can unwise ground manoeuvres,
putting the extremely tough roll cage to the test. It is
absolutely forbidden in the operator manual to grav-
jump the vehicle onto a transport pallet without using a
hoist. Naturally, it is also standard practice.
