Astrographically, Vincennes is a typical subsector with 32 star systems grouped into clusters of varying sizes, all accessible by a jump-2 ship. The subsector is named for the world of [[Vincennes]], which has been its capital since incorporation into the [[Imperium]] in 243.

With good communications within and beyond the subsector, [[Vincennes]] was well set to develop into a powerful economy, which it did. Today, [[Vincennes]] is one of the few TL16 worlds in the [[Imperium]], exporting small quantities of high-technology components and equipment in addition to larger amounts of TL15 goods.  Not surprisingly, it dominates local markets for high-end goods. However, not every world can make use of such items â€“ mid-tech equipment is a better investment on backwater worlds without the infrastructure to support advanced technology.

The early development of Vincennes was driven by the [[Humbolt family]] until their exile beyond the [[Imperium]] in 628. Progress continued afterward, albeit at a slower pace, and new dukes followed the existing practice of concentrating economic and technological progress on Vincennes rather than uplifting nearby worlds.  This ensured that Vincennes attained an unassailable position as the most advanced and productive world in the sector.

The Dukes of Vincennes see themselves as the foremost nobles of [[Deneb Sector|Deneb]] and have often acted as if they were sector dukes appointed over other subsector dukes, rather than equals. Vincennes expends a lot of effort in attempting to gain control over the systems of [[Star Lane Subsector|Star Lane]] and has been known to go to great expense just to win over a world government or mid-level noble for a time if it thwarts the plans of others.

The 258th Fleet has always had a difficult relationship with the subsector dukes. Whilst other great nobles in the sector seem to think they own the Imperial forces assigned to their region, Vincennes is the most blatant. Other dukes apply pressure upon their subsector fleet; Vincennes issues direct orders, even though this is not permitted, and routinely refers to the 258th as the Fleet of the Duchy of Vincennes.

In recent years, the duke has backed off a little on this approach, after a near-mutiny when the 258th Fleet was ordered to enter [[Sabine Subsector|Sabine]] and carry out actions that would inevitably lead to a confrontation with the 195th Fleet based there. However, it is only a matter of time before the [[Duke of Vincennes]] tries once more to use the [[Imperial Navy]] as his personal force and another admiral is put in the position of having to flatly refuse to obey an illegal order.
