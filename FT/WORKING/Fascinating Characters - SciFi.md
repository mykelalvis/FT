# The Heretic

Assassin
![[FC-SciFi-3_1-23_1476395148.jpg]]
## Background

Number Five was indoctrinated into the
Order, a guild of assassins. To its members,
The Client is an omniscient presence akin to
the collective will of their customers, and the
individual customers are akin to patron saints.

In the Order’s stronghold, the Creche, initiates
are molded through cultish brainwashing to
become unflinching servants. He was
meticulously trained in combat, theological
indoctrination, and the “execution of
contracts.” Despite exceptional skills and a
precocious aptitude for contract fulfillment, his
bent to independent thought and skepticism of
the Order’s doctrines created friction, which
erupted into rebellion, where he killed several
members of the Creche, including the revered
headmaster. Labeled the Heretic, he became a
prime target for the Order that raised him.

Taking his own contracts, he maneuvers
through the dark corners of the world, eluding
his former Creche mates while seeking to
unravel the mysteries of The Client and his
place in the universe.


## Skills


Natural Marksman: His lethal precision with
firearms is more aptitude than skill.
Sneaky Bastard: He is skilled in concealment.
Shadows and silence are his allies.
Combat Tactician: Adept at quick
adaptation, his strategies are unpredictable and
effective.
Theological Skeptic: His knowledge of the
Order’s theology, coupled with his critical
approach, allows him to manipulate the actions
of true believers.
Tai Chi: He practices Tai Chi, finding balance
and mental clarity in its fluid movements.


## Equipment


Penance Pistol: Tailored to his specifications
for reliability and deadliness.
Creed Blades & Cords of Silence: Knives for
close-quarters combat and garottes for silent
assassinations.
Seer’s Sight: Surgically enhanced during his
time in the Order, these implants grant him
superior vision.
Client’s Embrace: A specialized garment that
melds with the darkness, aiding his stealth and
providing minimal but necessary protection.


## Plot Hooks


A Contract Turned Personal: A new contract
strikingly aligns with his past, dragging him
back into the web of his former life and
challenging his newfound autonomy.
Dissent within the Order: Whispers of his
actions inspire others within the Order to
question their blind obedience, potentially
leading to allies or new adversaries.
Old Rival’s Vendetta: A former peer from the
Order seeks revenge against The Heretic for
past grievances.


## Story - The Client is Always Right

The Client is always right. From The Client flows our sustenance. The Client

gives our lives purpose. The Client determines life and death.

Life consists of constant struggle and pain. Only The Client can calm the

struggle and ease the pain; these are the ends he seeks. The struggle

manifests itself in physical needs and wants. It also manifests itself in the

search for identity. For the true believer, the retainer satisfies the physical

needs and wants; he finds purpose in fulfilling the contract.

The Client acts through his surrogates. The surrogates will ask for a life to

be taken. If the surrogate can pay the retainer, this is a sign that the Client

has decreed the Target’s death. If the surrogate cannot pay the retainer, The

Client has decreed that Target will live. The fool says, “I am beyond The

Client’s reach.”

The surrogate always considers himself The Client, but he is deceived. He is

merely The Client’s instrument, his pawn. Therefore, a most holy vow has

been perfected once the retainer is promised. The surrogate who breaks his

vow must perish because the true believer must fulfill the contract or die.

A Target is to be envied. He will be released from struggle and pain. Further,

he will be added to The Client’s marks. The marks will rest peacefully, unlike

those not chosen by The Client for this high honor. Fulfilling a contract

allows the true believer to serve The Client and the mark. The Client’s wishes

are satisfied, and the mark is freed from pain.

The Client bestows gifts on the true believer. Gifts of The Client are not

evenly distributed, though. The true believer must exercise his gifts to fulfill

his contracts to the best of his ability. The Client places Masters above us,

who instruct us in the proper application of our gifts. The masters provide

us with the tools to help us fulfill our contracts. In exchange, we honor the

masters’ wisdom in all things. This forms the substance of our contract with

the masters.

## Story - Kos

The intern knocked three times on the large
carved wooden door, straightened his shirt,
and quickly smoothed his hair down before
letting himself in. He tried to act as if he
belonged there but failed as usual; he still
gawked in wonder at the ornate office. Well, he
was in the presence of Arnold Hanson, the
Head Librarian for the Federal Research
Service. As many times as he’d been here for
his weekly assignments and subsequent
reports, he couldn’t get over the lavishness. A
carved wooden desk sat in the center of the
room, while smaller, more modern ones lined
the walls. All of them held teetering stacks of
books—the kind with real paper in them—
antique trinkets such as a globe of the Earth
that spun in the air synchronized to the current
time and other memorabilia from the Before
Times. He still wondered if that was an
authentic Ruben on the west wall. “Mr.
Hanson?”
“Yes, what is it, Wesley?” The older man
glanced up from a stack of papers, his
binocular-sized glasses hanging from his nose.
At least I think he’s old, Wesley thought. It
was hard to tell; his hair was gray, but he had a
perpetual spring in his step. “The Greek is here
to see you.”
Mr. Hanson stood up and reached for a
tissue, blowing his nose with the force of a
tugboat’s foghorn. “Damned dust.” He threw
the spent tissue into the recycler. “Who?”
Wesley shrugged. “He didn’t give a name.
Said he had something you were looking for.”
He scratched his head. “Just that you didn’t
know you were looking for it. He’s got a thick,
hermetically-sealed attaché case with him.
And—”
Mr. Hanson leaned back over the stack of
papers. “Tell him to take it to Submissions for
verification.”
“I told him that. He said, ‘Tell him I have
#23 with me.’” Wesley stood a little straighter.
“There’s only one thing that could fit in that
attaché case and be—”


“Yes, I know.” Mr. Hanson slowly nodded
as he raised his gaze to his young intern. “The
Greek, huh? Don’t know him.” He sat at his
desk, removed his gloves, and flipped up his
WorldNet Loop Feed. “Fred, scan the lobby,”
he instructed his Personal AI.
“No nuclear, biological, chemical, or
nanotic threats detected,” Fred reported in a
soft, clear voice.
“Video.” They both studied the screen as a
collage of images showing the lobby appeared
on the screen. One person stood in the middle,
a bulky case sitting at his feet. “The dwarf?”
Mr. Hanson asked.
“Yes, sir,” Wesley confirmed.
“Hmph. Request Terran Identity and
Background Check.” After a few moments,
Fred threw up the young man’s dossier on the
screen. Hanson read it aloud. “Archemorus
Koskos. Age 19. Height and weight typical for
dwarfism. Born in Athens. Grew up in the
slums.” He sat a little higher in his chair. “A
banger with the Spartans.” He pursed his lips
and nodded. “Tough kid. Especially
considering his size. Let’s see...small-time
arrests. Nothing serious. Mostly thefts of
antiquities. I didn’t think there was anything
left there to steal. Got caught for fraud two
years ago. Tried to pull a con on the tourists.
Nothing since. Absent parents. Sister Charlotte
was the Spartan’s leader. I wonder how she
managed that...” He turned back to the video
feed. Mr. Koskos looked around in jerky
movements as other patrons walked in and out
of view. He shifted back and forth on his feet.
“Looks nervous.”
Wesley snapped his fingers. “That was my
thought, too. Should I call the police?”
The Librarian drummed his fingers on his
desk. “No. Anyone with the balls to show up
and try to pass off that kind of forgery is
someone I want to meet.” He swung his chair
around and rested his interlaced fingers on his
stomach. “Show him in.”
Wesley hurried down to the lobby. “Follow
me, please, Mr. Koskos. The Head Librarian
will see you now.”
Mr. Koskos blurted out, “Really?” and then
rapidly regained his composure. “I mean, great!
Lead the way!” He fell in behind Wesley and
held the case protectively under his arm in an
almost comical fashion; it was the size of a large
suitcase compared to his stature. As the
elevator door closed, he gave a start. “Wait!
You know who I am?”
Wesley smirked at his charge, glad to have
the upper hand for once. “Of course.”
They rode the elevator the rest of the way
up in silence.
Mr. Hanson was leaning back against his
desk, arms crossed, as they stepped into the
room.
“Mr. Hanson,” Wesley said, “Mr.
Archemorus Koskos.”
“Hello, Mr. Koskos,” Mr. Hanson said.
“May I get you something to drink?”
“Call me Kos. And no, thank you.” He set
the case down at his feet and took a step back.
“I just want to get rid of this.”
The Librarian stood up from his desk,
dropped his arms to his side, and stared at the
case. “You are not a very good negotiator, are
you, Kos?”
“I’m an excellent negotiator.” He puffed his
chest out. “But...I don’t want anything for
this...except a jail sentence.”
Wesley didn’t see his boss express
confusion too often. He always seemed to have
the answer; if he didn’t, he pretended the
question was unnecessary. What he saw now
was pure, unadulterated flabbergastary.
“Kos, I’m confused. Do you have copy #
in that case or not?”
“Yes.”
“And you want to go to jail in exchange for
it?”
“Yes.”
“Why?” Mr. Hanson asked with a light
chortle.
Kos appeared to shrink, making his short
stature even shorter. “Because if you don’t put
me in jail, Annabelle Song, the woman who
hired me to steal this from her brother, is not


going to be happy with me when she finds out
I turned it over to you instead.” He shrugged.
“I’m hoping you could make it look like I was
caught or something.”
“Annabelle Song’s involved, huh?” He
regarded the case and then Kos again. “Okay,
I can see why you want to hide in jail, but...I
still don’t understand why you’re turning it
over to me?”
Kos glanced down at the case. “Because
when I looked at it, something came over me.”
He ran his fingers through his black curly hair.
“I don’t know what to call it. But...hell, I don’t
know how to explain it. What I do know is this
doesn’t belong in an attic somewhere. People
should see it. Appreciate it. It’s us.” He held his
arms out to the side and appeared to glance at
the whole world at once. “All of us, whether
we know it or not. We need to be reminded of
that.” He looked up at Mr. Hanson. “Bushy,
huh?”
Mr. Hansen studied Kos for two heartbeats.
“Fred, tell Linda Callahan to drop what she’s
doing and to get her ass up here.”
A few moments later, Linda came in
wearing her customary coveralls, all pockets
full of gadgets. Today, she’d given herself a
crewcut, half-pink and half-blue.
Mr. Hanson pointed at the case. “Take this
down to Verifications. All other work stops
until this is done.”
Linda looked at the case with reverence. She
pulled a portable remote sensor off her belt
and scanned the device. “Shielded. Can’t get a
reading.” She worked a few controls on the
small screen. “What the heck’s in it?”
“An original Gutenberg Bible.”
Linda opened and then closed her mouth.
She stared at the case as she put her sensor
back on her belt. “I thought they were all
destroyed during the Troubles?”
“If my source is correct—” he looked at
Kos “—this is #23. There’s no record of it
being destroyed with the others. It’s just been
assumed to have been.”
Linda carefully picked up the case like it was
a bomb. “I’ll have an answer within the hour.
We still have some paper frags from the others
for comparison.”
Mr. Hanson turned back to Kos. “No, that’s
not ‘bushy’ at all, my young friend.”
“You believe me then?” Kos asked, eyes
wide with hope.
Mr. Hanson chuckled. “I believe you
believe it’s what you say it is. And that’s good
enough for me because who the hell would
intentionally pass off a forgery in exchange for
a jail sentence?” He stopped and tilted his head.
“How long did it take you to make the
decision? To bring it to us?”
Kos stuck his chin in the air. “As soon as I
saw it, I knew what I had to do.”
Mr. Hanson smiled. “Kos, five seconds of
moral clarity can change the world around you
for the better...if you have the courage to act
on it.” He took a deep breath and looked over
to Wesley. “It’s time I kicked you out of the
nest. I’m promoting you to Field Curator.”
Wes’s face brightened. “Does that mean I
get a raise?”
“I didn’t say that!” He tilted his head again
and scratched his chin. “Actually, yeah, you do.


Fred, set Wesley up with the standard Field
Curator expense account. He’ll need transpo
and a flat in India. Give him an FRS-3 Security
Clearance.”
“Yes, sir. And might I say, sir, that it’s about
time.”
“Yeah, well, no one asked you.” He threw a
devious smile at Wesley. “Find what else the
Songs have that’s on our wish list.”
He slowly walked over to Kos and put his
hand on his shoulder. “And you, young
man...I have a fate worse than jail in mind for
you. You’re my new intern. Consider it
probation. I want to see how many more five-
second instances of moral clarity you have in
you.”
Fred chimed in. “I’ll make the necessary
arrangements with the police, sir. FRS-
Security Clearance for Kos?”
“Yeah.” He slid his glasses back onto his
nose and returned to his stack of papers.
“Wesley, on your way out, show Kos to your—
his—room. And show him your duties.”

# Schuyler Rader

Cybernetic Warrior
![[FC-SciFi-3_1-23_1476395363.jpg]]
## Background

Schuyler “Sky Raider” Rader was once known
as the most formidable trooper in the galactic
corps. Known for his relentless courage and
unyielding will in the face of danger, Rader’s
mind was as sharp as his aim. However, during
a cataclysmic battle on a dystopian planet,
Rader suffered critical injuries that left his body
beyond repair. Unwilling to let his tactical
prowess fade into oblivion, he made the
unprecedented decision to upload his
consciousness into a state-of-the-art cybernetic
body. This transformation turned him into a
living weapon, a fusion of human intellect and
machine precision.

The transition, though successful, had an
unforeseen side effect—it amplified his already
aggressive tendencies, pushing him towards a
more psychotic temperament. His new form,
menacing and resilient, was both admired and
feared.

The infamous incident where he dared an
opponent to rip out his stitches—if they could
