# INTRODUCTION

This adventure provides the Travellers with a starship (and a whole load of problems to go with it) and a mission to carry out. The latter is not the focus of this adventure; it is the hook. The adventure concerns the acquisition of the ship and resolution of some subsequent issues. As it turns out, the ship is not waiting handily in a nearby dock but is located on a nearby world where it has become stuck due to an equipment breakdown. All the Travellers must do is travel to the ship's location and pick it up, after making a few minor repairs and dealing with any incidental problems along the way.

Simple enough on the face of it. However, this is the Imperial frontier and not everything goes to plan out here.

### THE THIRD IMPERIUM

High and Dry is set in the [[Spinward Marches]], within the [[Sword Worlds Subsector|Sword Worlds]] and [[District 268]] subsectors. It is a complete and self-contained adventure, requiring only the Traveller Core Rulebook to play.

This adventure might feature very little combat depending on the path the Referee chooses the story to follow, and how things play out. In its basic form, the primary challenges the Travellers face are a mystery, a challenging physical test and the eruption of a volcano. However, should potential combat be desired by the Referee, there are several potential insertion points for a conflict with the previous crew of the ship they are searching for. The original crew are a nasty group, and certainly have some comeuppance coming to them. Whether this occurs as a shouting match, a brawl, a gunfight, or simply not at all is up to the Referee. An encounter with the previous crew is presented as a wild card that can be inserted at an appropriate point to add drama and immersion to the adventure.

Whether or not they encounter the previous crew, the Travellers might run into someone harbouring a grudge against them, resulting in aggression that might seem incomprehensible to them at first. The ship's original owners made a lot of enemies and might very well mistake the Travellers for them. Sooner or later, the Travellers will discover that their ship is a trouble magnet. Alternatively, there are a few creatures on the world the Travellers will visit that might give them problems during their search for the ship. However, it is entirely possible to complete this adventure without drawing a gun or throwing a punch. This is not deliberate, nor a suggestion that Traveller should not involve combat; but it is a good indication that an exciting and action-filled adventure need not feature combat. This adventure certainly does not lack action!

Of course, any written adventure is subject to the interpretation of the Referee and Travellers. As written, High and Dry does not have an alien invasion or apocalyptic gunfight at the end but that does not mean a Referee who added these things would be doing anything wrong. This is a framework for a Traveller campaign. Campaigns are supposed to be fun, so change whatever you think necessary and everything will be fine. Trust us, we are professional game designers...

### TRAVELLERS AND EQUIPMENT

This adventure can be played (and completed successfully) by almost any group of adventurers if they are able to think creatively and maximise their strengths. However, they will need to be able to pilot a starship, run its engineering plant and plot a jump if they are to make use of the ship in this adventure. The Traveller skill package (see the Traveller Core Rulebook , page 50) will provide everything needed in this regard and the adventure will suit just about any group of starting Travellers.

Other than the requirements to crew the ship, there are no encounters or challenges in this adventure aimed at any specific type of Traveller. Different Travellers will use different approaches and may struggle in some circumstances but this game is not about having the right weapons, skills or equipment to meet a challenge; it is about meeting what the universe throws at you with what you have and finding a way to win – or at least survive.

## INVOLVING THE TRAVELLERS

The default opening to this adventure has the Travellers given their task at [[Flammarion]] Starport. The 'hook' in this case is that the Travellers are tasked with picking up a starship and bringing it to [[Flammarion]] on behalf of the new owners – themselves.

### EX-SCOUTS

For newly created Travellers, just setting out among the stars, this can be perfect. In the best of all possible worlds, an ex-scout among the Travellers will have been given the use of a scout ship as a Benefit when they mustered out – if this is the case, do not simply give the scout their ship. Inform them that they must report to the Detached Duty Scout office in the [[Flammarion]] Starport. From there, the adventure can start smoothly with [[#A GIFT HORSE|Mr Casarii]] telling them where the ship is and what they must do to claim it.

If there are no scouts due a ship among the Travellers, there are two good alternatives.

### FREE SCOUT SHIP!

A Contact of one of the Travellers has arranged a favour with the [[Scout Service]] to obtain a scout ship. All the Travellers need do is collect it. However, if this is the approach taken, grant the Travellers use of the ship on a limited basis, perhaps giving them a 'one-year contract' to use the ship, after which it must be returned to the [[Scout Service]]. The scouts are very covetous of their detached duty ships and do not hand them out to just anyone! The scouts will appreciate the efforts of the Travellers but the ship must ultimately be returned to the detached duty fleet in short order.

### OTHER TRAVELLER SHIPS

If another Traveller has gained a ship as a Benefit, you can simply swap the scout/courier for the appropriate vessel. In this case, the Traveller owns the ship (or whatever percentage of it they managed to accrue as a Benefit) but it will not be as simple as picking it up from the nearest starport. Instead, the [[Scout Service]] will inform the Traveller of where the ship actually is.

Changing the type of ship the Travellers are sent to collect has no fundamental effect on the adventure but the ship must be capable of entering an atmosphere.

# HIGHNDRY

Stock [[TravellerCore#SCOUT/COURIER]]

Many small vessels operated by the [[Scout Service]] or major shipping lines are registered under a number rather than a name but even those usually gain a name sooner or later. The scout/courier known as [[#Highndry]] is one of those. Officially designated [[Scout Service|IISS]] S001642-C, _Highndry_ is identified by both number and name in its transponder but only by number on official papers.

Originally built in 892 at a shipyard in the Gushemege sector, scout/courier S001642-C has seen service with all three major branches of the [[Scout Service]] (Exploration, Survey and Communications), although most of its time was spent on Communications duty, hence the -C on the end of its registry. It has been loaned out as a detached duty ship more than once, has suffered collision and combat damage, been rebuilt twice and even crossed the Great Rift both ways as well as going around via Corridor sector.

The last 92 years of its service life have been spent in [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]] or just beyond, out in the [[Outrim Void]] or [[Vargr]] Extents. Despite regular refits and the occasional complete overhaul, S001642-C has acquired innumerable dents, dings, incomprehensible minor modifications and more than a few idiosyncrasies. This is not atypical in ships of this kind, although there usually comes a point where the vessel is so worn out that it is not feasible to make repairs.

Sometime in the last century or two S001642-C was dubbed _Highndry_ by its crew and the name stuck. It is possible that there are old-timers out there somewhere who know what the name refers to but no record of the reason remains.

_Highndry_ is a standard Type-S, with all the usual features as well as its own characteristics. Its systems work, except as noted, to within normal tolerances. That means that although it is a little slow answering the helm when turning to port, it is annoying rather than dangerous. The air scrubbers are inefficient but functional and the galley sink is prone to backing up for reasons nobody has ever discerned. Yet for all that, _Highndry_ can cross the stars and get to its destination safely.

Well, usually.

_Highndry_ has been part of the [[Scout Service]] detached duty pool for decades now. These vessels are loaned to [[Scout Service]] personnel for private use on the understanding that the ship can be recalled to duty at any time even if the user is not. Ex-scout personnel on a detached duty spacecraft are often given the opportunity to participate in the ship's newly assigned mission if qualified for the job.

Detached duty ships tend to get a lot of abuse and even with annual refits paid for by the [[Scout Service|IISS]], they tend to go downhill over the years. This is true of _Highndry_. Its upholstery is torn and the corners are knocked off pretty much everything with corners. Some of the tables have ragged sharp edges with literally decades of fibres from the clothing of passing crewmembers caught on them.

Up until recently, none of this was a problem. However, a few months ago [[#Highndry]] suffered a serious failure in its control electronics which essentially rendered its drives useless. It was at that time parked in the crater of an extinct volcano on Walston in [[District 268]]. After several attempts to get the ship flying, the crew gave up.

Boarding the ship's air/raft, they travelled to the starport and made their way offworld, intending to go to the scout base at [[Spinward Marches]] and obtain whatever was needed to get it off the ground.

The crew got a nasty surprise at [[Spinward Marches]]. They had brought the ship's records with them as proof of what was needed, expecting to be given a set of spares and sent back. After all, they were detached duty scouts and the ship was assigned to them. The scout base commander saw things differently. The records showed the crew had seriously neglected the vessel – over and above the usual abuse that ships of this class incur – and had almost certainly run a scam on their last refit, pocketing service fees instead of using them to provide much-needed maintenance and repairs.

The scam was not a new one. When the time came for a [[Scout Service]] funded refit came, the crew bribed the dockyard crew to install parts scavenged from breakers' yards and sold components provided by the [[Scout Service|IISS]] for a profit.

This sort of thing is frowned upon and not merely because it is fraud. It also puts the next users of the ship in danger and could deprive the [[Scout Service|IISS]] of a vessel when needed. So, the crew found themselves in the slammer and the ship stayed where it was until someone could be assigned to pick it up and return it to [[Spinward Marches]] for a proper repair.

Highndry's major systems such as power plant and gravitics all work well enough but its control electronics are shot. A major repair is necessary for long-term safe operations but in the short term the most critical systems could be bypassed or replaced with just a couple of cases of equipment. A rather basic control software package could be installed to run the resulting Frankensteinian mess. It will not be pretty but will get the ship to the dockyard at [[Spinward Marches]]... probably.

Other than a great deal of wear, minor glitches in several systems and a thoroughly messed-up electronics setup, [[#Highndry]] is a standard scout/courier,

# FLAMMARION TO WALSTON

The adventure begins at [[Spinward Marches]] Highport. With new Travellers, it is assumed that they have recently mustered out of their careers and are due to pick up a ship.

### STARPORT LIBERTY

With Credits burning a hole in their pockets and time on their hands, the Travellers are free to enjoy what [[Flammarion]] Highport has to offer, which is a lot. There are plenty of shops, bars and restaurants, as well as recreation facilities ranging from squash courts to prize-fighting arenas. [[Flammarion]] Highport has the feel of a boomtown. It is a crossroads, a place where Travellers begin their adventures and prepare to sally forth into Charted Space.

The port has a similar Law Level to the planet below (Law Level 4). In practice this means sidearms can be carried, as can blade weapons. Although shotguns are legal, anyone wandering around with one attracts the attention of the portside security force. Similarly, while discreet body armour is acceptable, someone stomping about in a flak jacket will be viewed with suspicion. There is simply no need, in the eyes of the port authority and thus anyone wearing overt armour is assumed to be up to no good.

Most bars and other facilities require that weapons be checked at the door. This can be inconvenient when shopping and many visitors just leave their weapons aboard ship or in their hotel. Violence is uncommon in the clean and well-lit corridors of the highport, other than the occasional punch-up in a bar. Such occurrences are one reason why most bars prohibit guns.

Society is generally cosmopolitan and easy-going. By far the majority of people are human, although they come from several cultures and can seem quite alien at times. The largest minority are [[Vargr]], with smaller numbers of Aslan and odd members of other species.

The Referee should allow the Travellers as much time as they want to explore the highport, buy anything they need (rich Travellers might be eager to spend Credits gained as Benefits from their careers), read library data from public-access terminals and generally get used to their environment before beginning the adventure. However, aimless wandering about a starport has its limits. Once the Travellers run out of self-imposed direction, the Referee should get the adventure moving.

### A GIFT HORSE

At least one of the Travellers will have an appointment to keep with a Mr. Anders Casarii of the Imperial [[Scout Service]] office at the highport. Casarii has a proposition for the Travellers. During the meeting, he explains that one of the [[Scout Service]]'s detached duty vessels is stuck on a nearby world and needs bringing home to [[Flammarion]]. The ship has suffered a major problem with its electronic systems and needs a crew to deliver some replacement parts. They must also download a replacement operating system into the ship's computers to ensure that any corruption caused by the failure does not endanger the vessel.

Once the ship's systems are up and running, it must be brought back to [[Flammarion]] Highport where a proper systems overhaul can be made. There may be unexpected complications, of course, so ideally the crew will be multi-skilled and flexible enough to deal with whatever comes up.

The ship is downed at Walston, four parsecs away, where the previous crew abandoned it. The ship was a detached duty scout/courier assigned to them and has apparently been mistreated. There are penalties for abusing detached-duty ships since they still belong to the [[Scout Service]], so the crew were shipped offworld and incarcerated. In any case, the ship legally belongs to the [[Scout Service]], which will provide appropriate documentation to allow the Travellers to pick it up and bring it home.

The [[Scout Service]] will also provide vouchers for refuelling at [[Asteltine]] and Bowman on the way back and tickets aboard a passenger ship to Walston. All necessary spares and software will be provided, along with override codes that will allow the Travellers to delete the ship's operating system and install a new one. The old system may be badly corrupted and in any case it is still keyed to the old crew. Operating the ship with that system still in place would be hazardous if it were possible at all. The new system is temporary. It will work for three months without an update and then ground the ship at the first planetfall after expiration for security reasons.

### THE BASIC OFFER

The Travellers are offered middle passage to Walston and Cr1000 each for incidental expenses up front, plus all costs for life support, fuel and so forth during the recovery of the ship. Once the vessel is brought back to [[Flammarion]], the Travellers will then be given hotel accommodation and another Cr1000 for expenses during the week or so it will take to check over the ship and make sure its software is properly updated. If there is an ex-scout among the Travellers who has rolled – but not yet received – a Scout Ship, then the ship is given to them on the terms described under "Scout Ship" [[TravellerCore#Other Benefits|here]]. If there is no unrequited Benefit to work with, the Travellers are awarded a one-year lease on the ship, after which they must deliver it to a scout base for return to the detached duty pool.

The Travellers will then have to meet their own life support and fuel costs and must keep the ship in good order in case it is needed. The vessel's logs will be examined whenever it passes through a [[Scout Service]] installation, providing information on starports and ship movements in the area. If the Travellers are able to retain possession of the ship, the [[Scout Service]] overhauls it at the end of each year, free of charge.

In addition, there are some ways to make a few Credits on the side. For example, the [[Scout Service]] pays – although not much – for first-hand reports on starports, cities and outposts a ship has visited. For the sake of recording a few lines detailing the Travellers' impressions and experiences of the places they visit, they can cover at least their bar tab in any given port.

### ACCEPTANCE

If the Travellers accept the mission, they are given the equipment they need – three flight cases full of circuit panels and tools for swapping them out, plus a portable diagnostic/software download unit the size of the other cases. Their ship will leave in a day or so, allowing some time to finish up anything the Travellers need to do before they head off on their mission.

The Cr1000 expenses is credited to the Travellers' accounts and can be used as they please. What they spend it on and whether or not there is anything left for actual expenses on the trip, is up to them. The second Cr1000 instalment given to the Travellers, for lodging on Walston, becomes available after they reach their destination.

### EN ROUTE

The Travellers have mid-passage tickets for the Type-A2 far trader Autumn Gold , under Captain Michelle Corelli. The ship is bound for [[Elixabeth]], a few parsecs to trailing of [[Walston]]. Its route is via [[567-908]] and [[Walston]], with drop-offs at each point.

Autumn Gold is not a [[Scout Service]] ship but has been affiliated with the scouts for a few years and takes on charters like this from time-to-time. Its captain will not discuss the deal in more than very general terms but essentially Autumn Gold has been chartered to deliver a couple of crates of supplies to the bare-bones starport at [[567-908]] and the Travellers, as well as a container of general spares and components, to [[Walston]]. Most of its other cargo is bound for the naval base at [[Elixabeth]]. It is mundane stuff; uniforms, boots and a few cases of wine for senior officers but captains wishing to get naval contracts of any sort learn not to talk about what they are shipping or to whom as a matter of basic security. The crates are not marked as bound for a naval installation; they look like any other shipping crates.

The crew of Autumn Gold are a typical mixed bag of tramp-trader personnel. Some are ex-navy, ex-scouts or former employees of large merchant lines. Others signed aboard at a port and were trained on the job. The medical officer is in fact a college kid gaining experience as a shipboard medic before beginning a proper degree in medicine. The ship is a typical far trader; functional rather than luxurious. The accommodation is a bit worn and the food is, well, edible. The passenger area is clean enough but there is little that is new or expensive. Similarly, the crew are polite enough but they are spacers first and foremost, not public-service workers. Those that are expecting a luxury hotel travelling althrough space will be disappointed in such vessels (though the big liners usually live up to their expectations) but for those simply trying to get from place-to-place, Autumn Gold is an entirely acceptable conveyance.

There is not that much to do aboard a far trader for a week. It is very unlikely that passengers will be permitted access to the ship's critical areas (engineering and the bridge) and the available space tends to be somewhat limited. However, there are games, holovid dramas and educational materials on the ship's entertainment consoles and a common area to sit in and shoot the breeze. This is economy travel and nobody should expect more.

On the plus side, the Travellers can catch up on reading and sleep, get to know one another and are not disturbed by disasters, explosions or hazards more serious than a dropped coffee cup. There may come a time in their adventuring careers when they pine for a week of humdrum but safe travel.

### THE LONELY AND FORLORN WORLD OF [[567-908]]

Roughly 168 hours out of [[Flammarion]], Autumn Gold makes jump emergence at 119 diameters out from the planet designated [[567-908]]. Data on the world is available on any of the ship's consoles and there is not much to tell. The world is dry, has a thin atmosphere and is officially uninhabited.

Once the cargo is delivered and refuelling is completed, the ship will be moving on as soon as possible. Autumn Gold is only stopping over for a day. Other than a chance to get out of the ship for a while, there is really no reason to go groundside at [[567-908]]. The landscape near the starport is drab, dreary and depressing, offering little to do other than skim fuel from the local marsh, refine it and get back on one's merry way. However, the chance to wander around may be attractive after being cooped up for a week. The planet does feature more varied geography several hundred kilometres from the starport but unfortunately for the Travellers, none of it is visible or within reach during their limited stay.

While refuelling is going on and cargo is being shifted to a big hut that serves as a temporary warehouse, the Travellers are free to look around.

By the time the ship is refuelled and ready to move on, chances are that the Travellers are more than ready to depart. They may have some sympathy for the people who have to work on [[567-908]].

While it is beyond the scope of this adventure, [[567-908]] is, in fact, the homeworld of a sophont species, one that has yet to be discovered. For more information about them, refer to _Marches Adventure 5: Safari world_. The Travellers are not likely to discover tell-tale evidence that such a species exists but dropping a few clues might make for a nice setup for an eventual return to this mysterious world.

### PLANETFALL: WALSTON

The crew announces that their vessel will be making a brief stop at [[Walston]], only staying for a few hours. Experienced spacers can probably figure out why. The ship is on a charter which will be for a reasonable time given the distance that must be travelled. There is nothing that can be done about the time spent in jump but if time on-planet can be cut short then there will be days or even weeks at the end of the voyage when the Autumn Gold is essentially still being paid for the charter but is free to engage in other activities. The price tag is a tired and bad-tempered crew of course but in the short term the vessel can make extra cash.

Data on [[Walston]] is available from the ship's Library software. The Referee can decide how much or how little information to release to the Travellers but at a minimum the approximate population, the fact that the entire population lives on one island, and an overview of local conditions should be available. There is little turbulence as Autumn Gold dives through the thin atmosphere towards [[Walston#Settlement Island|Settlement Island]] and soon the far trader is on the ground at Walston Starport. The associated [[Walston#Startown|startown]] has a population of about 600 people and resembles a semi-underground village rather than a major city. It is, however, one of the world's three main settlements.

Astute Travellers might notice that there are no other ships at Walston Starport and although there are a couple of roofed berthing pits that might contain a vessel, a quick look suffices to assure the Travellers that there is no vessel present. The ground crew, if anyone thinks to ask them, might remember a scout/ courier coming through a few weeks ago with a similar name to the one the Travellers are looking for. They do not know where it went after it left.

To enter the town, it is necessary to pass through customs. Although the locals have a sustainable TL8, they have an imported weapon scanner and can detect most weapons. Local laws prohibit private ownership of most weaponry. Any guns or blades longer than a dagger must be placed in storage at the port for a fee of Cr10 per week. The guards at the port carry handguns and wear light flak jackets. They do not see a lot of trouble and would probably be caught by surprise if someone did something stupid like trying to shoot their way through customs. A response team equipped with assault rifles would respond in short order to such an incident.

If the Travellers hand over their weapons, passing customs is a matter of signing a few forms and answering the usual questions about length of stay and business on planet. The customs people deal with a starship every day or two on average and rarely remember much about those that pass through. However, the crew of [[#Highndry]] were memorable for their general lack of courtesy towards everyone around them. A Traveller with good social skills (such as Persuade or Diplomat) may be able to tease some information out of the customs personnel.
![[MA1-377.jpg|]]

### RACISM ON WALSTON

If the Travellers are focused on their mission, the treatment of [[Vargr]] on Walston may slip their notice. If they have a [[Vargr]] among them however, then things can get a lot more interesting.

The key to remember is that on [[Walston]], racism is never overt. A [[Vargr]] Traveller will never be singled out, will never be lynched, will not even have derogatory comments thrown at them. Instead, everything should be done by suggestion and implication. The human population on [[Walston]] view themselves as superior to the [[Vargr]] who reside there. They believe that humans are more fit to run things and that [[Vargr]] are best suited to subservient roles.

For example, if a [[Vargr]] Traveller approaches a customs officer, government official or shop owner and asks a question, the Referee should pause, consider the question and then deliver the answer to one of the human Travellers. The assumption being made is that the humans are in charge of the Travellers' party and so they are the only ones worth talking to. If the [[Vargr]] Traveller insists on the answer being delivered to them (and they should), always be polite but make the answer short – then deliver the longer and fuller answer to a human.

For specifics on how the people of Walston view [[Vargr]] (and how [[Vargr]] here view themselves), see [[Walston#SOCIO-POLITICAL DATA|the world data]].

The Travellers might want to find out what has happened to 'their' ship. Pretty much anyone in town will suggest asking at the Port Authority office, which maintains records of passing ships. These are freely available to anyone who wants to look but [[Walston]] has a policy of not placing such data on the general datanet. Thus it is necessary to go to the office (which is next to the port and so within five minutes' walk from any point in town) and look at the records in person. There is no fee for this. Access is granted for the asking but the information is not left lying around. This is not a deliberate security policy so much as the easiest way for a small staff to do things. It is rare for anyone to want information of this sort so a policy for making it available has never been created.

### INFORMATION IN TOWN

From the ground crews, folks in town, official records and customs personnel, it is possible to find out the following information about the scout/courier [[#Highndry]] :

- The vessel came through the port a couple of times in the past year. The last time was about three to four months ago.
- The crew were real jerks, loud-mouthed and offensive. They apparently did not like anything about [[Walston]]. They were displeased by the food and the beds in the hotel, hated the décor, found the local practice of wearing a kilt somehow hilarious and made a mess everywhere they went. Simple concepts like putting trash in a bin eluded them and they seemed to think they were better than everyone else put together.
- The scout was in dilapidated condition when it came through but seemed flyable enough. In any case it came and went a couple of times over the months running up to its final visit. On that occasion [[#Highndry]] spent a couple of days in port before moving on.
- Its destination is recorded as 'In-System' but there are no details other than a note that the ship was on charter to the world government of [[Walston]].
- A couple of weeks later the crew turned up at the starport in an air/raft and hung around making a nuisance of themselves until a ship bound for Caladbolg came through.
- They boarded the far trader _Maverick Spacer_ , according to records. Apparently the crew of [[#Highndry]] took passage aboard this vessel for [[Caladbolg]] via [[Datrillian]].
- Their subsequent destination is unknown.
- They took their air/raft with them but left behind a few thoroughly trashed hotel rooms.
- Nobody was sorry to see them go.

In short, the ship seems to have gone somewhere on [[Walston]] and met with difficulties. The crew seem to have dumped it and left the planet, although it is possible that they went in search of critical spares.

What seems apparent is that the world government chartered [[#Highndry]] to do whatever it was doing when the final systems failure occurred. Its location, or at least its destination, is almost certainly known to the government at [[Walston#Central Lake|Central Lake]].

Although [[Walston]] has a perfectly good communications net, the government will not release information unless the Travellers go to the capital in person and meet with a government official. They are promised reimbursement for the cost of their travel, accommodation and a full explanation over dinner. To obtain the best and most complete information, the Travellers must go to the capital.

### WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED

The crew of [[#Highndry]] really were a bunch of obnoxious jerks, who managed to land themselves in jail. This is how the [[Scout Service]] learned their vessel was downed on [[Walston]]. The ship was on loan and the [[Scout Service]] decided it would be more usefully assigned elsewhere. The crew explained the ship had problems but failed to volunteer information about its whereabouts. The [[Scout Service]] genuinely believes the vessel is parked at the starport.

The former crew are out of the picture now and their loan of the vessel has been legally revoked since they have allowed it to fall into disrepair. However, they see it rather differently and may someday show up wanting 'their' ship back.

### BAD SEEDS

This adventure, as presented, need not involve the previous owners of the ship. They may remain part of the backstory of the [[#Highndry]] and only exist in the imaginations of the Travellers as a group of ne'er-do-wells who belong in a penitentiary more than they do on the bridge of a starship. However, if the Referee wishes to give them a more menacing presence, have them make an appearance.

The surly former crew of the _Highndry_ are likely to be in jail for any number of offences, not the least of which is breach of contract for their mistreatment of a detached duty scout ship. Their eventual incarceration is just about guaranteed but before they end up in the slammer, they might make one last-ditch effort to reobtain 'their' ship. Should the Referee determine that they do, it will be after having travelled aboard the _Maverick Spacer_ to [[Caladbolg]], where they obtained some spares to attempt repairs of the ship, then returned to [[Walston]]. Lacking the skills to get the job done properly, they are not likely to succeed and are fortunate that the Travellers have appeared on the scene.

The crew may attempt to barge in at several points during the adventure to assert their claim. This may result in a number of scenarios which are largely dependent on the Travellers' actions. These are a few suggestions:

- At the starport or the capital. This is best played after the Travellers learn something about the former crew, including how disliked they were by the locals. This will set the stage for an eventual confrontation, at which point the Travellers can point out that they have a legal claim to the ship and therefore any attempt by the former crew will be an act of theft or even piracy.
- During the climb of Mount Salbarii. Having the former crew attempt to ascend the mountain at the same time as the Travellers will add to the tension of the climb and possibly result in a dangerous bout of combat.
- After the eruption of the volcano and subsequent events. The former crew wait until the ship, battered and beaten as it is, is safely delivered back to the starport. If the Travellers acted as the heroes of Mount Salbarii, doing everything they could to save the people affected by the volcanic eruption, then the locals protect them, shooing the former crew off and 'helping' them obtain the first possible basic passage off Walston aboard a passing far trader. However, should the Travellers fail to help anyone, possibly not even attempting to help anyone at all, they will receive no aid from the locals and must face down the former crew on their own.

The Travellers may have to wait around for a few minutes but eventually they will be spotted by an overworked clerk who recognises them as 'not from around here' and tries to put together a suitable reception. The Travellers are offered comfortable seats in a side room, with coffee or wine to drink and a plate of pretty good biscuits – this is about the limit of hospitality that can be offered off the cuff around here.

Within a few minutes a government official, Alan Greener – the Minister for Offworld Affairs, Public Relations and Fisheries, as it happens – enters the room and apologises for the delay.

He listens to the Travellers' story (if [[Vargr]] are present, remember to concentrate on the humans), looks over the papers and thinks for a moment. The Minister explains the situation, which may not be entirely to the Travellers' liking.

### THE SHIP IS WHERE?!

Minister Greener explains the situation regarding the scout/courier. Its crew were, frankly, a bunch of troublemakers but for lack of anyone better the government chartered their vessel for a simple job.

They somehow managed to botch the task and disable their ship into the bargain, then departed in the direction of the starport aboard an air/ raft before anyone knew what was happening. They took a ship out of the system a couple of days later and have not been heard from again.

The Travellers' documentation seems to be in order and, with no way to verify it 100 percent, Greener is willing to accept it at face value. He will tell the Travellers where the ship is and help them get access to it... if they agree to complete the mission the original crew were supposed to have carried out. Greener can offer a flat fee of Cr3000 in cash – a case full of Imperial Credits as it happens – but it is important and he is not willing to cooperate unless the Travellers finish the job.

The task is not complex. Greener needs the Travellers to use the scout's planetary survey equipment and a bunch of seismic charges (which are aboard the ship, presumably, since they were given to the previous crew) to carry out a geological/seismic/tectonic survey of a region not far from the capital.

Greener is willing to admit that he cannot stop the Travellers from fixing up the ship and making off without holding up their end of the bargain but he thinks he is offering a fair trade; help in getting the ship and a little hard cash in return for a job that's important to Walston but will take only two or three days to complete for a suitably equipped group. He will not even discuss the ship's location unless the Travellers agree to his proposal. If the Travellers are honourable people they will surely be willing to keep their end of the bargain.

Greener is not willing to part with more cash – he already paid a lot to the previous crew and Walston does not have money to throw around. If the Travellers request more, Greener decides to wait for another scout/courier or similar vessel to come through the port. After all, they are hardly uncommon.

If the Travellers agree, Greener outlines the problem. There is a volcano on Settlement Island, called [[Walston#Mount Salbarii|Mount Salbarii]]. It was thought extinct for millennia but has recently rumbled a bit and caused occasional tremors. A geologist who was passing through a year back took a look and concluded that it was 99 percent or more certain that this was just a 'twitch' on the part of the mountain, i.e., that there was no danger.

However, Greener wants a more detailed survey and a map of the interior of the mountain. Originally he intended to send this off for analysis at one of the high-population-world universities but recently became aware that a scout/courier's survey equipment could provide all the data he needs, such as the chance of an eruption within, say, the next decade. So, he hired [[#Highndry]] to carry out the survey and something went wrong. Now that the Travellers are here the job can be finished just as soon as they get to the ship and reactivate it. The only problem, and it is not a major one, is the location of the ship, which is, of course, parked in the crater of a possibly active volcano.

# Mount Salbarii

See [[Walston#Mount Salbarii]]

Getting to the base of Mount Salbarii from the town is not too much of a challenge. The Travellers are on government business, so it is not too hard to arrange to be driven to the mountain in an offroad vehicle. Indeed, the first 500 metres of the ascent can be undertaken aboard a vehicle, albeit not quickly. After that, it is not really feasible to drive a wheeled vehicle any higher. An ATV or an air/raft could do it but there are none available.

## First Segment Rest Stop

While resting at [[Walston#800–900 METRES|the top]] of the first segment, the Travellers make an unpleasant discovery – the bones of two humanoids, probably human, along with a forlorn collection of very decayed mountaineering gear. The bones show obvious signs of a fall. It seems that one of the climbers fell and injured himself very badly. His companion was attempting a rescue when some sort of disaster befell them and they died together on the mountainside. The remains are half a century old and little of their gear is of any use now, although pitons and the like might be salvaged. A close examination of the bones reveals that they have been aggressively picked clean, possibly (and ominously) by some sort of insect.

## Second Segment

Two things occur at some point during [[Walston#900–1,100 METRES|this segment]]

- First, they see that another group of mountain climbers has begun to assemble at the base of Mount Salbarii. The Travellers' view of their base camp is obscured, so they cannot tell how these explorers got there. Presumably, they had a vehicle transport them there but it must have come from the other side of the mountain.
- Second, they begin to be bothered by [[Salbarii Locust|large locust-like insects]]. Over time, any exposed flesh on the Travellers' bodies is bitten by the pesky insects. As they continue their ascent, the insects begin arriving in groups.

## Third Segment

Unfortunately, the Travellers have wandered into the habitat of an [[Walston#Salbarii Locust]] whose ecosystem is limited to [[Walston#1,100–1,200 METRES|this band of the ascent]]. They are attacked by a swarm of them and Travellers with exposed flesh are attacked until they cover up. As the biting insects descend upon them, the Travellers' vision is reduced to approximately two metres and all checks are made at DM-2.

The chaos of the insect event likely causes the Travellers to lose sight of the other mountaineers, unless they expressly make an effort to keep track of them. If this occurs, allow them to make an Average (8+) Recon (INT) check to discover that the group is making their way up the mountain on a more or less parallel track to that of the Travellers.

## Fourth Segment

As they approach the next and final phase of the climb, they note that their competitors are making considerately better time than they are and despite having started an hour or two after the Travellers, appear to be set to reach [[Walston#The Crater]] at the same time. If the Travellers attempt to call out or reach them by radio, they receive no response. A successful Recon check using binoculars, PRIS goggles or similar device reveals that the group is eyeing the Travellers from a distance, so their lack of communication seems deliberate.

### THE SCAVENGERS

As they approach the summit, their path finally crosses with that of their fellow mountaineers. They are locals who heard rumours of an abandoned starship in the crater. While they have none of the skills or experience necessary to operate a starship, they are quite certain they can scavenge the ship's remains to make a tidy profit.

This encounter is highly volatile. The scavengers view the offworlders as interlopers; foreigners who have no right to dictate terms on their homeworld, so their initial disposition towards the Travellers is not favourable. The Travellers might be able to present evidence that they have a right to recover the ship; however, they are on dangerous ground. While the scavengers are not necessarily the murderous sort, if the encounter goes poorly and the two sides come to blows, an 'accident' could befall the visitors. As far as the scavengers are concerned, no one might ever discover just what happened. The encounter is not likely to go this way but if the Travellers are aggressive, the scavengers might feel cornered or endangered and lash out at them. A persuasive or intimidating group of Travellers might convince the scavengers that they have laboured in vain. The ship belongs to them and the difficult climb to the top was a wasted effort. The Referee must determine how the scavengers respond. There might be an argument, fisticuffs or, if the Travellers are the friendly and diplomatic sort, they might even negotiate some type of agreement by which both sides can profit. Whatever the case may be, the Travellers must carefully navigate this encounter so they can proceed to their goal.

# IN THE CRATER

Descending into [[Walston#The Crater|the crater]] is hard work but not unduly hazardous unless a climber is suffering severe [[Walston#^altsick|altitude sickness]] and cannot keep their balance. However, it will take time to climb down and even longer to get back up if the ship turns out not to be flyable.

Getting across the lake to the _Highndry_ should not be a huge problem. The lake is deep but not especially wide. Prudent Travellers might decide to make some kind of float to get themselves and their cases of spares across to the ship rather than just plunging into the lake.

Travellers exploring the crater are likely to make two finds sooner or later. The first is that there are several lava tubes around the outside of the crater, mostly in the outer zone. The second is that they have company in the crater.

### THE LAVA TUBES

Most of these are dead ends but a couple lead to caverns under the lake. These might be worth exploring from a mineral prospecting point of view. They are slightly warmer than rock would normally be, which may cause Travellers to worry.

### COMPANY

The crew of the _Highndry_ had a guard animal or possibly a pet. This beast was, or rather is, an omnivore the size of a large dog and similar in temperament. That is, were it not starving after living on what it could scrounge from the crater and the trash around the ship for several weeks, it would be friendly to those it considered part of its community or family. A reliable guard animal, companion and disposal unit for meal scraps under normal conditions, the beast is at present a threat to everyone around it.

The animal belongs to a species named [[Tensher's Wolf]] after its general appearance and the scientist who identified it. Tensher's Wolf is not native to the [[Spinward Marches]] but is often imported as a guard animal. As luck would have it, the animal is suited to the environment in which it finds itself. While adaptable to standard atmosphere mixes, it evolved in the mountains of a world with a thin atmosphere. Among its adaptations are large lungs and expandable blood vessels that enable it to extract needed oxygen from Thin – and with some effort, Very Thin – atmospheres.

It is covered in sandy-brown fur which blends fairly well with the undergrowth and is adept at hiding from its prey. Tensher's Wolf prefers to attack by surprise. Normally it will not attack humans but this example is desperate and starving, and on top of that may consider the Travellers to be intruders into its territory especially if they go near the scout/courier. If it chooses to attack someone it will try to pick an isolated Traveller if possible.

The behaviour of this creature depends entirely upon the Travellers. If they are not aware of it or do not actively attempt to feed and befriend it, it will try to kill and eat them unless it can steal something to eat from them instead. An encounter where the creature steals food from the Travellers' camp might cause them to realise that it does not fear people and might in fact be an abandoned pet. If the Travellers leave suitable food for the creature and allow it to satisfy its desperate hunger, it can be approached. If treated like a member of the family, it will revert to being one and eventually become a loyal guard animal/pet. If the Travellers do not befriend the creature they will have to kill it before it kills and eats one of them.

### THE HIGHNDRY

![[MA1-421.jpg|300]]
[[MA1-421.jpg|Map]]
Once the Travellers reach the island, they can see that the Highndry's hatches are all closed but just about everything inside it has been dumped outside in a huge mess made worse by some kind of animal raking through it looking for food. It would appear (correctly) that the crew attempted a repair then stripped everything of value that they could carry from the ship, dumped the rest and took off in the ship's air/raft. Among the wreckage is a forlorn metal food bowl licked clean long ago. The name 'Kimbley' has been hand-stamped into the metal of the bowl. Someone once cared for the poor starving beast now haunting the island but not enough to take it with them when they left.

Among the stuff that has been turfed out of the [[#Highndry]] are ration packets, all of which have been ripped open and the contents (plus a fair amount of the packaging) devoured. Most of the rest of the stuff has been destroyed by [[#COMPANY|the animal]].

Gaining entry to the [[#Highndry]] is not very difficult. Its reactor is powered down and the batteries are all but drained, although there is sufficient power left to accept an entry code for the airlocks but the doors will have to be manually opened. Inside, the ship is a terrible mess. The crew never took proper care of the ship when it was their home and in the process of leaving they were not gentle.

On top of that, virtually every access panel is open, the covers are off everything that has a cover and there are components strewn all over the deck. Putting it all back together will be a big job. Fortunately, some of the components can be bypassed or replaced with the gear the Travellers brought with them up the mountain. The resulting lash-up will not be pretty or safe for people walking past but it should suffice to get the _Highndry_ to a dockyard where a proper repair can be conducted.

The first stage will be fixing up the power, life support and flight systems and running some simulations with the ship's software. This is a job that really should not be rushed; a problem with the ship's control electronics at the wrong time would be disastrous.

So, having climbed to the top of the world, the Travellers can finally begin the job they came to Walston to do.

### REPAIRS, SURVEYS AND TREMORS

Repairing the _Highndry_ is a relatively straightforward task for Travellers who have the right equipment, i.e. the spares they have been given. The repair mostly takes the form of removing a large number of demountable circuit blocks and either bypassing or replacing them depending on how essential they are. The portable download/diagnostic unit can then ascertain whether a given system is useable or needs further work.

There are four main systems needing repair:

- Flight controls and navigational systems (bridge)
- General shipboard electronics (dispersed throughout the ship)
- Power systems electronics (engineering)
- Drive systems electronics (engineering)

Each of these jobs takes 1D+2 man-hours to complete. Most of the work can be done by an unskilled person who has been shown how, as it simply requires identifying a circuit block by its code number and a simple remove-and-replace procedure. However, the Referee should ask for an Electronics check at the end of each job.

The Travellers should not be told the difficulty level, creating a degree of uncertainty about whether the job has been done properly. In fact, between the diagnostic unit and a suitably skilled person offering guidance to those doing the actual work, there is no real chance of a disaster.

In addition, the ship's computers need to be accessed and purged, then the temporary control software uploaded. This can be accomplished by anyone with the Electronics (computers) skill and again a check should be made.

In the event of a really terrible check, the Travellers may want to redo the task, which takes another 1D+2 man-hours.

However, provided due care was taken there will be no serious problems with the ship's systems when the time comes to fire them up. Nothing ever works properly first time however, so a prudent crew will undertake a series of ground tests and a low altitude shakedown flight before blasting off into the unknown. It is all but inevitable that some sort of problem will appear and have to be fixed. In the meantime there are two other jobs that need doing.

The first is making the [[#Highndry]] habitable. The general electronics systems dispersed throughout the vessel deal with things like life support, recycling and lighting but there is also a fair amount of filth and mess that must be cleared out before the ship is really fit to live in. A number of quite important components such as air filters are missing and must be located – the crew dismounted everything they might be able to take with them, selected the most portable and valuable, and left the rest scattered throughout the ship and on the ground outside. Locating and replacing important parts will take several people a couple of days and cleaning up properly will take even longer.

There is also the matter of the seismic survey to be carried out.

### THE SURVEY

The Travellers do not, strictly speaking, have to keep their promise to Minister Greener. The people of Walston could not stop the scout ship from simply taking off with the work undone. However, if the Travellers wish to pick up any belongings they did not bring up the mountain with them, or to take on supplies for their voyage, the locals will want to know how the survey is going and may decide to be difficult if they think they are being taken for a ride.

The survey itself can mostly be done on the ground and may be quite entertaining is it involves emplacing a series of seismic charges and detonating them. The charges are aboard the ship, strewn around in a frighteningly haphazard manner and the sensor equipment for the survey is separate from the flight and power systems. The previous crew had little call to use it or mess with it, so it remains intact and functional unlike most of the things they got their hands on.

To do a really thorough job, the Travellers should emplace ground sensor units all over the crater and in some of the lava tubes. Charges should be set off in some of the tubes as well. The effects of the charge detonations will be used by the scout ship's computer to create a three-dimensional model of the volcano.

When matched up with readings taken by more sophisticated sensors like the vessel's high-penetration densitometer, this will allow the computer to predict if and when an eruption is likely. Other indicators include measurements of the lake temperature and samples of the gas mix around the crater area.

The survey will take about 10 man-hours to do cursorily and twice as long to carry out properly. Ideally Travellers with Electronics (sensors) or Science (planetology) will be available to carry out the data analysis and someone with the Explosives skill to emplace the charges but the system is reasonably idiot-proof and need not be too precise that a typical group of Travellers cannot muddle through somehow. After a few hours of blowing up small areas of rock and vaporising the occasional bush, the Travellers will get a fright.

### THE TREMOR

Although the Travellers do not know it, their actions have nothing to do with a slight tremor that shakes the mountain in the middle of the survey. It is not especially violent but goes on for a surprisingly long time, bouncing things around in the scout ship and making it difficult to stand in the open.

After what seems like far too long, the ground stops trembling. At first it seems like nothing is different, then two things will be noticed. One is a slight plume of dust or gas escaping from the south-western side of the mountain. The second is a disturbance in the surface of the lake. As the Travellers watch, huge bubbles rise to the surface of the lake, which then subsides.

Astute Travellers may notice that the lake level is dropping. Not quickly, just a centimetre or two each minute, but the lake is slowly draining away. A small fissure has opened in the lake bed and it is draining into the lava tubes – which may be a problem for anyone in there at the time. It will take hours for the lake to empty, as it is 30 metres deep in places. All that will be left are a few forlorn pools. By this time the fissure will have ceased to vent gas and the mountain will once again be quiet. However, these events may give the Travellers cause for grave concern.

### CONCLUSIONS

The Highndry's computers (and any Travellers with relevant skills) will come up with a prediction after a few hours. There are many variables and nothing is certain but it seems likely that the mountain is indeed becoming active.

It would appear that the lava plug deep in the volcano's innards has been breached and magma is seeking a way to the surface.

It is highly likely that there will be an eruption of some kind within a few months. However, the scale is not expected to be very large. Chances are good that there will be very little lava actually reaching the surface and what does escape will cool long before it reaches the base of the mountain. Gas and ash clouds are more of a problem but again it is likely that the eruption will take the form of a steady release of pressure, with a plume of ash-laden gas escaping from the top of the mountain to be blown downwind (which means to the west, across the island and out to sea). This will look alarming but should not seriously threaten even the nearest town.

The computer model is relatively certain that there is no significant hazard to any settlement on the island, not even the handful of outlying farms that dot the fertile land below the volcano. However, it does suggest that further monitoring is advisable as the entire prediction is based upon one incomplete map of the mountain's structure.

### TEST FLIGHT

At last the [[#Highndry]] is ready for a test flight. The Travellers may be suspicious that the ship's systems are not in perfect working order, a reasonable conclusion as no-one ever gets a complete overhaul of this kind right first time.

A prudent crew would use the training-mode simulators on the ship's controls to make a dry run before take-off and run low then full-power tests on the ground. A sensible approach of this sort will take a few hours but will iron out the worst of the faults before take-off.

However, a nervous crew may want to get off the mountain right away, in which case the [[#Highndry]] can be prepped for flight in a few minutes. However, it will function somewhat erratically. Un-calibrated controls, sudden faults in various electronic systems and the occasional burst of sparks from something will conspire to make the crew's task very difficult. If proper tests are not carried out before flight, DM-2 applies to all Pilot and Engineer checks until the crew can find a couple of hours to fix the worst of the faults.

Once the faults are fixed, the [[#Highndry]] can be operated without penalty, although it does not quite 'fly right'. It is sometimes slow on the helm, sometimes erratic. Autostabilisation is wayward at best and power systems are not 100-percent reliable. All of this makes operating the [[#Highndry]] a nerve-wracking and tiring business. However, the Travellers are going to need to fly and soon.

# ERUPTION!

Just as the Travellers are preparing for their test flight, several things happen in fairly rapid succession. Most are alarming and the rest are downright scary. The first sign of a problem is a gentle pinging from the sensor data processing suite. This may not even be noticed unless someone is monitoring it or in the same room. The suite wants to inform the crew that it has revised the eruption prediction based on new data. To the computer, this is a dispassionate exercise and of no real urgency.

To anyone looking at the data from the point of view of, say, being sat on top of the volcano, the new data is a little more urgent.

The computer displays tables of temperatures and gas mixes and such, plus a helpful three dimensional model of the mountain which shows a huge lava plume smashing through the plug and filling the tubes. If asked for a prediction, the machine shows the top blowing right off the mountain in about six minutes' time. The Travellers just have time to realise that they cannot possibly get clear when the machine pings again to indicate revised data. Now it shows a much reduced lava plume simply pouring out into the crater and down the sides of the mountain, accompanied by a cloud of hot gas and ash. The first wisps of smoke can be seen coiling up from the lava tubes and the lakebed fissure. What water remains is beginning to boil. An eruption is obviously imminent and the ground begins to shake.

On-the-ball Travellers may have time to wonder what has changed, since the lava plume is now much smaller than the one depicted a moment ago. They will find out in due course.

In the meantime, there is still lava rising up the inside of the mountain and seeking a way out into the crater. The Travellers have a few minutes to take off.

As the last pre-flight checks are being made and the power plant brought up to full power, a plume of smoke can be seen rising from the south-western side of the mountain, well outside the crater. The ground shudders and the ship's radar begins warning of incoming missiles. These are in fact chunks of rock flung up into the air by the eruption going on well down the flank of the mountain.

The lava plume has found a way out, through a path that was too far down the mountain to appear on the survey.

While this means that the Travellers will not be incinerated in the crater and that there will be no catastrophic release of pressure resulting in the top being blasted off Mount Salbarii, it does have other implications.

By now the air in the crater is becoming too hot and too laden with volcanic gases to breathe. As the ship lifts off, lava begins to boil out of the lakebed fissures. If the Tensher's Wolf previously encountered is still around and has not been adopted by the Travellers, it will run for the ship seeking the safety of home. If it has already been befriended, letting it aboard will not be a problem. On the other hand, if the Travellers have just allowed a terror-stricken carnivore into the ship, where it finds strangers instead of its human masters... problems are likely, to say the least.

As the scout ship lifts clear of the hell zone that has become of the crater, bushes begin to catch fire and the air is filled with dust and ash. The radio is active, with two transmissions on similar bands.

### TRANSMISSION ONE

The first transmission is coming in from the capital at Central Lake by way of the starport orbital beacon. Minister Greener wants to know what is happening. He has some garbled reports of smoke from the mountain and a tremor.

He would like to know how serious the situation is and what the long-term implications are.

Greener has little information and does not know how bad things are. However, as he receives reports of ash clouds in the sky, he begins to realise that things are serious indeed. At this point he becomes increasingly desperate for information. The Travellers have little to give him other than their own first-hand account of the eruption.

### TRANSMISSION TWO

At more or less the same time, the town mayor's office at Salbarii tries to contact the Travellers. The tremors have been felt in the town, about 20 kilometres to the north of the mountain and dark clouds can be seen issuing from the mountain. The mayor and his tiny staff have issued a general alert and, like Greener, need information.

### DECISIONS

The Travellers could cut and run at this point but for a minor problem. Their fuel tanks could be filled easily enough by taking on seawater and cracking it for hydrogen. However, a number of red lights appear on the jump drive control panel. The drive is inoperable until a proper repair is undertaken, which will necessitate removing a number of bulky components to get at the critical systems. This really needs the sort of tools and hoists found at a starport. If the Travellers ask, Greener or any other government official on Walston will be happy to offer them use of the equipment they need if they will help with the present crisis.

For the time being, what the Walston authorities need is information. The world's handful of grav vehicles are en route to Mount Salbarii and a special train full of security personnel, fire and rescue workers, and the like, is being assembled. For now however, the only people able to make any real difference are the Travellers. Greener wants them to make a flyby of the whole mountain and the surrounding region, and report what they see. A direct video feed via the starport beacon would be ideal. Once he knows what is happening, Greener will be able to decide what to do – or better, put a full picture in front of the dictator and let him formulate a response.

The Travellers have a choice here. If they choose to run they will not be welcome on Walston and can expect no help with the ship, although they should be able to fix up the drives themselves eventually. In the meantime, people may be in danger and they have the means to help.

![[MA1-426.jpg]]

# FIGHTING MOUNT SALBARII, PART 1

Assuming the Travellers decide to help, they will need to fly close to the mountain. There is a lot of thick haze caused by smoke and ash coming from the mountain and the odd rock flung into the air (the ship's sensors insist on wailing a missile alert for these), making the flight tricky. All Pilot checks are Difficult (10+) while operating in this environment. The ship's radar and other sensors make it possible to map the ground easily enough through the haze despite visual range being very short.

A circuit of the mountain reveals the following facts:

- There is a small amount of lava in the crater itself and some leaking from outlets on the higher slopes. This is not a significant hazard beyond the immediate area.
- There is a major eruption much lower down, where part of the mountainside has collapsed. A veritable river of lava is pouring out. This is on the south-western side of the volcano.
- The land slopes generally down to the sea from the erupting side of the volcano, offering the lava flow a direct path to the sea.
- The town of Salbarii, 20 kilometres north, is not in any real danger at present or in the foreseeable future.
- There are some small settlements, mainly just farms and a couple of hamlets, in the path of the lava flow. Within hours at most these will be swamped. The only settlement of any size in the danger zone has a population of about 60 people and is on the coast. It is not know for certain if it is endangered but this seems likely.

### RESPONSES

At first, there is little response from the people of Walston. True to their collective character, most people simply wait for someone else to take charge. There are a couple of notable exceptions, however. The fishing submarine _Ocean's Bounty_ has surfaced and is transmitting its intent to run into the coastal hamlet of Barvinn where it will take off as many people as it can. The mayor's office at Salbarii is broadcasting instructions for all inhabitants of threatened settlements to make for Salbarii where they will be looked after unless the town is in danger, in which case they will be evacuated by rail.

After a while Dictator Masterton comes on the air in person. From the poor quality of the transmission it seems that he is aboard a fast-moving vehicle. His instructions to the people repeat those of the mayor of Salbarii – head for the town where a rescue plan is being put in place. Those who cannot get to Salbarii should make a run for Barvinn on the coast and await rescue. Masterton asks to speak to the Travellers (assuming they have offered to help). He is indeed aboard a grav car heading for Salbarii, one of just three owned and operated by the government. He quickly outlines the situation.

There is a road – more of a dirt track really – up to Salbarii but it runs close to the mountain and may already be cut. There is also a single-track rail link down the coast to Barvinn which will stay open for a while. A train has already been sent to pick up the town's population. However, it is likely that some people will arrive after the train has departed. The submarine can take a handful off; the remainder will have to wait for a second run by the same train – Walston has a very limited transport system.

Masterton is going to set up a command post at Salbarii and send his grav vehicles to pick up anyone who is stranded. He hopes the travellers can help by getting an estimate of the lava flow rate. If so, this will indicate how long the town of Barvinn has before it is endangered. Ideally the Travellers will also be able to say whether the road is still open and report on conditions in general. Their radar terrain mapping system could help predict the best routes out for endangered personnel.

This comes down to three main tasks:

- Map the terrain and model the lava flow path.
- Establish a flow rate for the lava river headed in the general direction of Barvinn.
- Monitor the conditions at the mountain and report any changes.

### MAPPING THE TERRAIN

This requires a couple of overflights and a successful Electronics (sensors) check. The map shows what is already suspected – Barvinn will be consumed by lava and the overland route will be cut before anyone can use it. The railroad will stay open almost to the end, however.

### ESTABLISHING THE FLOW RATE

The lava is following ground contours and flowing much like a river as a result. Hovering directly above a flow is not a good idea but it is not very difficult to fly slowly parallel to a flow and try to estimate a rate of advance. This will require ignoring distractions like the spectacular combustion of nearby vegetation and a successful Electronics (sensors) or Science (planetology) check. The Recon skill might also be used to create a quick and dirty estimate.

Combining this estimate with the terrain map should enable the Travellers to estimate how long Barvinn has before the lava reaches it. The figure of roughly one to two hours seems reasonable at this point.

### MONITORING THE MOUNTAIN

There is still some doubt as to whether Salbarii is in imminent danger or will need to be evacuated in the longer term. It may be that the town is perfectly safe. Which of these is true will have important implications for the handling of this disaster so again the dictator needs information to make a decision.

Ideally, the Travellers should return to the mountain (a part without lava spurting out of it would be good) and emplace some sensors in short holes drilled in the rock. This will allow an estimate of both temperature and stresses in the mountainside, which will allow an estimate of how long the eruption will go on for and if any more unpleasant surprises can be expected.

Landing on the mountainside is tricky but not especially dangerous so long as the Travellers stay away from the immediate vicinity of lava flows. The air is hard to breathe but a filter mask or air supply will suffice to deal with this problem. It is also, not surprisingly, hot.

Emplacing sensors takes half an hour or more, with a couple of hops from one point to another aboard the scout ship. Its air/raft would have been most useful for this job but the ship itself can manage with a decent pilot. Fairly soon, the data begins to come in and there is good news.

The lava flow is slowing and the temperature of nearby rock is dropping ever so slightly. It would seem likely that the eruption will be quite limited after all. Paranoid Travellers might choose to recheck these findings, use different instruments and generally do a more thorough job. If so, they will realise that there is more to their findings than initially meets the eye. If not, the computer model will present the data listed below in a few minutes anyway.

### THE BAD NEWS

The lava flow rate has dropped because a plug has built up in the mountain somewhere. Now, sometimes this is a good thing as it can block the route to the surface and thus cause the eruption to end. However, in cases like this where there is a lot of pressure underneath, a plug of this sort tends to be short-lived. When it breaks, it will be like a dam bursting; the lava flow will massively increase and a chunk of the mountain may be quite literally blasted off.

According to the sensors and the computer model, Mount Salbarii is under rapidly increasing stress. Within just a few minutes the plug is going to fail and a massive eruption will take place. Worse, a huge cloud of super-hot ash and gas will be ejected from the mountain and will hurtle out across the coastal plain. The town of Barvinn will be destroyed and anyone in it will die.

The only good news is that the town of Salbarii will probably not be too badly affected, although a lot of ash is going to fall on it. In the long term the town may end up being abandoned but this would mean moving a significant chunk of the planetary population to new homes, representing a rather large project for the world government. It will not be even considered unless it seems inevitable.

# FIGHTING MOUNT SALBARII, PART 2

The Travellers would be well advised to get off the slopes of [[Walston#MOUNT SALBARII|Mount Salbarii]]. It is not possible to predict the exact effects of the lava plug failing, other than the general statement that it can be filed under 'really bad'. Anyone between the mountain and the sea will be killed for certain and the effects on the scout ship are likely to be severe to fatal. A withdrawal seems prudent.

### EVACUATION ORDERS

Within moments of reporting the situation to Dictator Masterton, orders begin to come in from the temporary command post at Salbarii. The gist of it comes down to an order to cut and run right now. There is a train - really just a locomotive and a couple of cargo cars - running into Barvinn. It will take everyone who is at the station aboard and make for Salbarii at best speed. There is nothing to do but hope it gets clear in time.

However, there are people still trying to get to the station, who will not be there by the time the train leaves. The submarine _Ocean's Bounty_ is in port at Barvinn and will take aboard anyone who can be crammed in before heading out to sea and submerging.

It should be safe, although nobody really knows how bad things are about to get. However, there are two groups that cannot reach safety in time. One is from an agricultural settlement, a farming hamlet well to the south. Ironically they might have been safe if they had stayed put or headed south but then maybe not. In any case, they are now well within the threat zone and cannot be reached by anyone but the scout ship.

Masterton asks the Travellers to attempt a rescue of this group. Asks, not orders. He acknowledges that the Travellers have taken risks already and have saved many lives. If they take their ship straight up they should be able to get above the threat zone and be safe enough. However there are 11 people, humans and [[Vargr]], some of them children, jammed into a couple of ground vehicles struggling up a dirt road towards a promise of safety that the dictator himself has just withdrawn.

So, the Travellers are requested to help. They could fly to the refugees, pick them up and then take their ship out to sea and submerge it. The _Highndry_ would not make a great submarine – keeping water out is different to keeping air in – but it could happily function a few metres down, which would surely be enough to protect it from the eruption. What of the other group Masterton mentioned? He regretfully says they are beyond help. In such a small population, he is acquainted with many of the planet's residents and this pair are particularly stubborn. Indeed, their daughter, who is on the dictatorial staff, is just as bad. Point is, Masterton knows these people. He can tell the Travellers who they are and what they do. He can offer a pretty accurate prediction of their reaction to news of the eruption and their stubborn refusal to be worried or to run for it until it was too late.

What he cannot do is save them.

Masterton has to make a decision – 11 people or two, and the two probably cannot be saved anyway, not even with the Highndry. So he asks the Travellers to abandon them and pick up the larger group who are nearer the coast. The two have just lost the numbers game; it is really that simple.

However someone else has different ideas.

### DECISIONS

The Travellers can see an ever-increasing flow of black smoke or ash-filled gas pouring from the mountainside. Their sensors show massive stress in the rock before going offline. It is time to run and decisions need to be made.

The relevant facts are:

- The Travellers could almost certainly get clear if they just decide to save themselves.
- Going after the large group is risky but there is a good chance they could do it and still beat the cloud.
- If the Travellers try to rescue the other group, they will be caught in the eruption for sure.

Before the Travellers can make up their minds, radar picks up an object coming in from the north, moving at well over 300 kilometres per hour. Its transponder indicates that it is a grav car with call sign Walston One - the dictator's own personal transport.

The limo is flying dangerously fast and somewhat erratically, right through the ash plume pouring from the mountain. It is probably flying more or less blind – grav cars do not have particularly great sensors as they rarely need to navigate under adverse conditions. The limo is broadcasting.

A breathless, growly voice – obviously a [[Vargr]] – is broadcasting on the emergency channel.

'Scout ship, get the big group. I'm going after my mother and father. I can get there before you can. Good luck.'

Masterton can confirm that his chauffeur was out picking up some refugees and has taken it into her head to try a rescue. Her chances are not good, to be realistic, but it is the sort of idiotic, stubborn, half-crazy stunt you would expect from... anyway, he says, it solves the dilemma. If the Travellers can pick up the refugees at Barvinn, there is a half-decent chance of saving everyone.

The Travellers still have to choose between definite safety and some risk in return for the chance to save lives. If they so choose, they can climb above the disaster zone or race out to sea and witness the final eruption from a safe distance.

If, on the other hand, they head for Barvinn they may find they get a closer view.

### LAST TRAIN OUT OF BARVINN

Assuming the Travellers decide to undertake the rescue at Barvinn, they arrive to a pitiful scene. The settlement is very small, just three dwelling complexes and a rail platform where trains down the single line terminate.

There is also a concrete dock with a semi-underground warehouse and a small crane for unloading boats and submersibles. The area between the dock and the station is flat and concreted over to make transfer of cargoes (mainly fish) from dock to railroad car as easy as possible.

There are two civilian ground vehicles, typical 4x4 pickups as used on the local farms, parked on the concreted area. Several people are rushing around in a state of shock and panic. Some are pointing at a train which is disappearing northwards, some at a fishing submarine which is just visible out in the bay. Others are trying to break into a dwelling complex while still others are calling the rest back to the cars. These people are clearly desperate and have no idea what to do for the best.

When the [[#Highndry]] appears, people begin to run towards it, waving, which of course will interfere with landing. The two cars on the concreted area are an additional obstacle, and landing without crushing them will be tricky (a Pilot check to avoid flattening a truck with the ship's landing gear would be appropriate). Just avoiding killing any of the people will be challenge enough.

Of course, while some of the refugees want to rush straight aboard the [[#Highndry]] , others would prefer to indignantly pour out a tale of abandonment and broken promises to anyone who will listen. People under great stress are not always entirely rational.

Rounding up the refugees may prove tricky. Some want to grab things from the vehicles, others are sure that one of their children, relatives or dependents are missing. The Travellers may have to use leadership or persuasive skills, or else drag people bodily into the ship and keep them there. All this will take just a few minutes but it will seem like much longer.

As the Travellers are struggling to round up the refugees, bundling them aboard or making the decision to abandon them, the mountain finally goes. A vast cloud of superheated gas, ash and rock fragments is blasted clear, rolling out from Mount Salbarii at high speed. Chunks of rock and large boulders are flung into the air. It is really quite spectacular. Presumably there is a massive lava flow behind and beneath the cloud but it cannot be seen at this point.

The gas and rock-fragment cloud (correctly termed a pyroclastic flow) is moving at about 75 kilometres per hour and is roughly four to five minutes away. It is quite high, making a climb over the top a difficult proposition in the limited time the scout ship has before its arrival. Running ahead of the flow, out to sea, then submerging, is a better prospect.

If the Travellers pick either option, they will encounter only mild effects. The scout will be buffeted about by a high wind pushed ahead of the cloud, and the pilot will struggle to maintain control, but there is no serious danger to the ship. If the Travellers take to the water they will discover that the flow can travel a long way over sea and will turn the surface layer to steam but does not heat the water to any great degree more than about five metres down. It does deposit lumps of rock which sink and bang against the hull, creating a sensation similar to being depth-charged.

The [[#Highndry]] will survive either of these options with a few new dents and scorch marks to go with the many it already has. However, the valiant [[Vargr]] chauffeur and her parents will not. If the Travellers choose not to go to her aid, the limo is forced down on the shore and overwhelmed by the pyroclastic flow. There is no chance for anyone to survive such an event.

### DISTRESS CALL

As the _Highndry_ is lifting off from Barvinn, the Travellers pick up a distress call from the dictator's limo. The [[Vargr]]'s voice is even more breathless and there is a roaring sound that suggests that the windshield or another window has been shattered. There is also a hideous whining sound in the background which sounds like tortured lift units – anyone who has worked with gravitic units can tell the limo is in serious trouble even without the distress call.

The content of the call is plaintive and desperate.

_'Mayday... Mayday, this is Walston One. The car is damaged, drives are failing... windows are cracked, I can't see properly... I think I'm heading for the sea but we're losing speed and altitude. I don't think we're going to make it. Is there anyone? Please?'_

The voice gets weaker and then cuts off entirely.

Radar shows the limo limping towards the coast, losing height fast. It is perhaps a minute or two ahead of the pyroclastic cloud emerging from the mountain, and actually outpacing it for now, but within moments it is going to be grounded. The limo's projected crash site is less than two minutes' flight time away but the cloud is going to be only a minute or two behind that.

If the Travellers ignore the distress call, a [[Vargr]] chauffeur they have never met and whose name they do not even know, and her parents, will burn to death and be entombed in ash but they and their shipload of refugees will survive.

If they go to the rescue, the pyroclastic cloud will engulf all of them for sure and there is no way of telling what will happen.

### INTO THE CLOUD

If the _Highndry_ heads for the projected crash site, the limo drops off radar but can be tracked by its transponder beacon. The sky is black with dust and falling ash, and it is very hard to see without electronic assistance. It takes a few moments to locate the downed limo, which is in a terrible state. Much of the damage was done before the crash, it would appear. Someone is firing flares from the emergency kit but the radio seems to be out.

As soon as the three [[Vargr]] spot the [[#Highndry]] (which is not easy, given the circumstances) they begin stumbling towards it supporting one another. The chauffeur's comments about not being able to see properly are given a different context when any Traveller spots her face. She was hit in the face by fragments of the windshield when it shattered and blinded by blood coming from a great many small cuts.

The falling ash is now moving almost horizontally. Even in the thin air of Walston there is a considerable wind picking up, driven before a 75 kilometres per hour cloud of superheated steam and volcanic debris. The cloud will bury the [[#Highndry]] easily if it is caught on the ground and the heat will overload its systems and broil the occupants alive. The only chance is to run for it.

However there is less than one minute to impact and no chance to outrun the cloud.

There are basically three options. The first is to climb as high as possible and try to get above the cloud. This will at least avoid the worst of the debris but there is no chance to get high enough to avoid being engulfed. The second option is to run for the sea and try to submerge. The cloud will catch the [[#Highndry]] before it can enter the water, however.

The third option is the best but not by much. If the [[#Highndry]] hits the cloud head-on, its aerodynamics might lessen the impact and at least it will have its strongest axis pointing at the threat.

At the very least, everyone should strap in or grab something.

The Highndry's bunks and cabin seats are all fitted with straps and crash frames, so eight people can be secured in the cabins as well as those on bridge chairs and emergency crash seats in engineering. The rest will simply have to cling on to something and hope for the best.

Whatever the Travellers choose to do, they will be hit by the pyroclastic cloud and will have to deal with its effects. The base of the cloud is a layer of superheated steam. If the scout ship is above that (just a few metres) then the temperatures are not sufficient to damage the vessel. However, the shockwave hitting the [[#Highndry]] will have severe effects.

Physical damage to the vessel itself will be minor but objects and people inside will be thrown around by the impact. Base damage for everyone inside is 3D at directly into the cloud and by another 1D if the Traveller is properly strapped into a crash frame or seat. Those simply clinging to something must make a Very Difficult (12+) STR or DEX check to gain this reduction. Those who fail take full damage and in addition are dislodged from their hold on whatever it was, causing them to bounce around inside the ship for the next few moments.

As already noted, physical damage from the impact is not massive but the [[#Highndry]] is flung upwards and out, away from the volcano and towards the open sea. Worse, the power plant and drive system are overloaded and cut out for a moment. This causes all the interior lights to go off, then come back on dimly as the emergency batteries cut in. Unfortunately these are not sufficient to power the lifters or the main drive, which is a shame because the [[#Highndry]] is travelling in a ballistic arc without power and both tumbling and spinning to boot. Any moment, the ship will reach the top of its arc and begin to fall. It is unlikely that anyone will survive the crash when it hits the ocean.

![[MA1-434.jpg]]

## SAVE THE SHIP!

The Travellers are inside an unpowered, tumbling, spinning death-trap that used to be a space vessel. They have been flung out of the pyroclastic cloud but will soon fall back through it into the ocean. People and objects are flying about inside the ship.

The Travellers will need to act fast to save the Highndry. Note that a scout/courier cannot glide; it has no control surfaces and while streamlined for passage through atmosphere it is not aerodynamic in terms of generating lift. With even just a little power it can be pointed in the right direction and made to fall controllably but it needs a powered drive to fly. That is the very thing it lacks.

There are two things that need to be done to make the scout ship controllable. The first is to reboot the control systems, which can be done from the bridge or engineering section. The second is to manually override the safety cut outs on the power plant and get power to the engines. The sooner both of these things are done, the sooner the pilot can begin trying to regain control of the ship. There are three segments to the fall: Going Up, Going Down and Seconds to Impact. During each segment the pilot may attempt a Pilot check if they have both controls and power. The more successful checks they make, the less severe the effects suffered by the _Highndry_ will be. If other crewmembers make their checks to supply power and control in a given round, the pilot can immediately attempt to gain control of the ship.

_To reboot the control systems:_ Average (8+) Electronics (computers) check or Difficult (10+) Pilot check.

This can be done from engineering or any bridge console. If the pilot completes this task, they may still attempt their Pilot check to save the ship.

_To get the power plant out of emergency shutdown mode:_ Average (8+) Engineer (power) check.

This must be done from engineering and requires physical access to the power systems, i.e. the Traveller will have to leave their seat and more or less cling to the power plant as they work.

Both of these tasks must be completed before the pilot can attempt to stabilise the ship. The pilot can make their check to regain control in the same round that the other two tasks are completed. This may mean waiting for another task to be completed; it is equally possible that the crew will get everything working in the first few seconds after the ship begins to tumble.

### First Successful Pilot Check

The ship is stabilised and is at least falling predictably.

### Second Successful Pilot Check

The ship is under power and begins to respond to the helm.

### Third Successful Pilot Check

The ship is under full control and can avoid crashing.

Note that it is not necessary to roll damage and checks for every one of the refugees during these scenes. They make a lot of noise, pass out, vomit, shout for help, scream in terror or pain and occasionally do something stupid like trying to get out of a crash frame in order to run around in a panic. The Referee should use them as scenery to add to the drama and possible tragedy of the situation.

## GOING UP

The _Highndry_ is nearing the apex of its crazy tumble through the sky. It is spinning wildly during this segment and all attempts at checks are made at DM-2 unless the Traveller is secured in some way.

Anyone who is not strapped into a crash frame or a seat is liable to be flung about and hurt. Travellers simply clinging on to something and trying to avoid being hurt may make an Average (8+) DEX check to remain stable and not allow themselves to be bashed against the fittings.

Failure results in 2D damage. A Traveller clinging to something can grab someone else, requiring a STR check and save them from damage. These checks are not penalised for the tumbling of the ship since the Traveller is secured to something, even if it is merely by their fingernails.

A Traveller who is held by another in this manner will not be hurt and can attempt to use their skills without penalty for the ship's movement. Teamwork of this sort represents the best chance for success. Other Travellers may find themselves trying to catch refugee children who have come loose from their seat straps or struggling to hold an unconscious friend against a bulkhead and prevent further injury.

## GOING DOWN

The [[#Highndry]] begins to fall and stabilise somewhat. This is nothing to do with being under control; the vessel will tend to stop tumbling on its long axis due to its shape. It goes into a flat spin, which is not much of an improvement in the grand scheme of things. Anyone not strapped in or otherwise secured makes checks at DM-1 and suffers 1D damage from being bounced around.

## SECONDS TO IMPACT

Literally seconds before impact, the ship's automatic systems will bring the controls back online and remove all the safety cut outs from the power plant. The ship's avionics have detected that a collision is imminent and disregarded all other considerations in order to allow the crew a chance to save the Highndry. Damage to the drives or even an explosion is no worse a fate than hitting a planet at speed.

However, the [[#Highndry]] is still in a flat spin. Auto-stabilisation systems make a single, two-second attempt to right the ship and correct the spin and then shut down in a cacophony of overload alarms and wisps of smoke from the control systems. The pilot gets one attempt (with no penalties for the spin) to get the ship at least partially under control.

If power and control systems were already back online, the pilot simply needs an Average (8+) Pilot check to get the ship properly under control. Anyone bouncing around unrestrained in this segment suffers 1D damage.

# MOMENT OF TRUTH

What happens next depends upon how many Pilot checks succeeded. Three attempts were possible, assuming that control and power were restored in the first segment.

If the pilot made all three, the [[#Highndry]] pulls out of the spin and lifts its nose, accelerating out of the dive over the sea and climbing unsteadily to a safe altitude. There is a fair amount of minor damage to internal components, people have been violently sick and the ship is a bit worse for wear but the ordeal is over.

If less than three Pilot checks succeeded, things do not go so well.

### TWO SUCCESSFUL CHECKS

The Highndry's spin is stabilised and it is answering the helm but this is a little too late. It hits the surface of the ocean at the bottom of a shallow but high-speed dive, skipping on the surface before pulling up and climbing into the air in a triumphant spray of steam and minor debris. Everyone aboard takes 2D damage if loose, 1D if held or clinging to something, and no damage if strapped into a crash frame or seat.

### ONE SUCCESSFUL CHECK

The [[#Highndry]] is sort of under control, mostly, when she hits the water surface in a steep dive. It arrows deep into the bay and embeds its nose in the silt at the bottom, coming to rest stuck in the seabed a dozen metres down. Its hot hull boils water around it and hull plate groans under the stress of rapid cooling. Alarms are ringing and there is water getting in somewhere. Then the lights go out.

The initial impact causes 3D damage to anyone bouncing around loose, 2D to those secured by others or clinging to something and 1D to anyone strapped into a proper seat or crash frame. It is up to the Referee to decide how much to make of being stuck in the seabed. The simple option is for the crew to be able to restore power in a few minutes and to allow the ship to pull herself free. More sadistic Referees (our favourite kind) can create a whole mini-disaster movie out of this situation.

Really evil Referees might like to note that the [[#Highndry]] is nose down and leaking slightly. The ship's bridge and avionics are at the front. The effects of seawater on the ship's electronics are up to the Referee (it probably will not be good) but it could be interesting trying to operate controls in a vacc suit while underwater in a flooded bridge. There is an emergency helm station in engineering, which solves this problem in less dramatic fashion.

Sooner or later, it should be possible to get the [[#Highndry]] free using its lifters and return to the surface. Getting the water out might be an interesting challenge.

### NO SUCCESSFUL CHECKS

If the crew were not successful in self-rescuing, all is not (quite) lost. As noted above the ship's automatics make a valiant if unsuccessful attempt to restore control.

The result is a massive belly-flop onto the ocean surface, causing 6D damage to everyone aboard. This is reduced to 4D for anyone properly braced or held and 2D for anyone in a proper crash frame or seat. The [[#Highndry]] is badly damaged by the impact and plunges beneath the water.

The [[#Highndry]] bobs back to the surface in a huge cloud of steam, then begins to take on water from buckled hull plates. The drive is smashed up and power is offline. There is nothing that can be done to stop the [[#Highndry]] from sinking. It might be salvageable from the seabed at some point in the future but for now the priority is to abandon ship and take to the life rafts.

Fortunately, there are some. All shipboard survival kits carry one. A raft can squeeze six people in and there are two of them. Any extra personnel can cling on and hope a rescue boat arrives before the local wildlife does. Animal attacks while in the water are at the Referee's discretion. There are a couple of creatures that might try to attack a weakened human but this needs to be finely judged – it may be that the Travellers have suffered enough already. For those who need one more challenge, the problem of fighting off a sea creature with only what they can grab from the survival kit might be interesting.

The most likely assailant is an opportunistic Alderson's coastal hunter. The brakarr, a far more dangerous creature, is not commonly encountered in shallow water.

# AFTER THE DUST SETTLES

The Travellers will eventually make their way to the shore somehow or be rescued. When they do so, they will gradually find out the full extent of the situation. The Referee must determine how many people were killed or injured but it is entirely possible that (assuming everyone aboard the scout ship survived) there were no fatal casualties. Even if there were deaths, it is obvious to everyone that the Travellers are the heroes of the day. Whether by direct action or by bringing a warning in time they have saved dozens of lives among the small population of Walston.

Although the town of Salbarii may have to be abandoned in the long term, at present it looks like this may not be necessary. The volcano is 20 kilometres away and the centre of the eruption zone is pointed away from the town. Lava is likely to flow south and west, down to the sea rather than northwards to Salbarii. Ash and dust is blowing across the island but the prevailing wind is taking it mainly out into the ocean. The eruption itself is winding down now that the pressure has been released but it seems likely that the mountain will remain active and if so, living so close is not really desirable.

However, in the short term there is an atmosphere of celebration among the people of Walston. They have survived a disaster in better shape than might have been expected and have a few new heroes to adulate. The Travellers will find themselves invited to a number of parties all over Settlement Island and a reception at the dictator's palace. In the meantime the resources of Walston's tiny starport will be brought to bear on making the scout ship flyable, assuming it survived at all. Things quickly wind down however and the party atmosphere fades to be replaced with the more usual comfortable ordinariness of life on Walston. Note that with such a small population and limited resources, everything Walston has is going to be absorbed by dealing with the new problems faced by the town of Salbarii. There simply is not the cash available to shower the Travellers with gifts. The locals will make sure that the scout ship is well stocked with home-baked goods and the Travellers will probably acquire any number of home-knitted sweaters but there will be no big buckets of cash for them.

If the Travellers return to Walston in the future, they may become involved in further events spurred by the newly active volcano or an attempt to relocate people from the town of Salbarii. People from the Salbarii end of the island will always have great respect and friendship for the Travellers, although those from further away will probably wonder what all the fuss is about. They may even view the Travellers with suspicion, as if it were their fault the humdrum complacency of life on Walston was shattered by an exploding mountain.

### DEPARTING WALSTON

Sooner or later the time comes to depart Walston. If the [[#Highndry]] is flyable, it has to be delivered to [[Flammarion]]. If not, the Travellers will have to report its loss to the owners and the insurers. They may have to face some searching questions about the risks they took but given the state of the ship, thanks to the previous crew, they have a ready scapegoat to deflect any serious criticism of their actions – they can simply blame a breakdown caused by lack of maintenance.

Either way, it is time to go. There may even be a crowd of well-wishers to see the Travellers off when they depart. The [[#Highndry]] climbs to orbit, leaving behind Settlement Island and the vast plume of ash trailing from the volcano towards the mainland. The world of Walston shrinks in the distance, and finally it is time to jump.

The Travellers have vouchers for refuelling and life support resupply at [[Bowman]], so that is their likely destination. In the meantime they will have a week in jump to reflect on their adventures, gorge on baked goods and try to decide whose sweater is the most garish... as heroes do.

# EPILOGUE: FLAMMARION

The Referee can make as much or as little as they like of the trip to [[Flammarion]]. As a jump-2 ship, the [[#Highndry]] can make the trip in two jumps via [[567-908]] or three if it goes by way of [[Bowman]] and [[Asteltine]]. The longer route is actually cheaper as the [[Scout Service]] has provided vouchers for refuelling and resupply but at this point the Travellers can pretty much do as they please.

Upon finally returning to [[Flammarion]] Highport, the Travellers will be given accommodation in a nice hotel for a couple of weeks while the [[#Highndry]] is overhauled.
