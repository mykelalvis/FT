# Trade Station

Establishment for the promotion of interstellar commerce. There is no single controlling agency for trade stations: some are established by private companies, on their own or under contract to the [[Imperium]], some are run by the scout service, and others are operated by different branches of the imperial government.

There are five trade stations in the [[Aramis subsector]] operated by the scout service to promote trade with the Vargr. The installations, at [[Lablon]], [[Jesedipere]]. [[Junidy]], [[Focaline]], and [[Zila]], serve as clearing houses for merchant dealings. They provide numerous free services: language translation, temporary warehousing, brokerage, computer files of merchant information, a commodity exchange, and others.
