# INTRODUCTION

## The City of Aliens

A lonely city sits on the edge of a hot desert, in a solar system perched on the edge of a stellar desert.

This city of aliens is ancient. It is a home for secrets. A den of gamblers, thieves, hustlers and spies.

Welcome to Castrobancla. Have your papers ready for inspection, and make sure you've had all your shots.

# Setting and Location

## Amarja

Amarja is a secondary planet in a system with a mainworld with a Type A Starport, on the edge of a stellar rift.

Amarja has one large moon, Candra, about the size of Earth's moon Luna. It is close to the inner limit of the system's Goldilocks Zone, and is a Hot world.

Amarja's characteristics are D-866-684-8, Hot. Its trade codes are Ag, Ga, Ni, Ri.

Amarja is renowned throughout the sector as being a liberal, honorable world, and a tourist attraction.

Amarja's rotation period is thirty standard hours. An Amarjan year is 292 of their days, or 365 standard days.

[[#The Amarjan Basin]], where Castrobancla sits, is a few kilometres southeast of the Western Mountains, a coastal mountain range beyond which is the Great Western Ocean, the largest of Amarja's three oceanic bodies.

### Water

The basin is fertile, despite being in the mountains' rain shadow, because of the unique local geology providing water sources. The mountains are mainly limestone and sandstone, porous rocks allowing rainwater to drain through.

Rainwater from the ocean which lands on the northern and Western flanks soaks through the rock into underground rivers. These feed artesian springs, which bubble up in the Amarjan Basin. Castrobancla was built on the largest spring.

The waters have fed the life in the basin for thousands of years. Several thousand years ago, Castrobancla's builders, the Settlers, turned this natural phenomenon into an advanced irrigation system which has fed the livestock, crops, and the inhabitants.

Everything in the Amarja basin needs water to live. The city meets the demand through night stills, vaporators, imported comet ice and desalination, as well as through the artesian springs.

![[CasAss-025.jpg]]

> [!note] Night Stills
> Many Castrobanclan homes have a night still. At sunset the city's rooftops are usually festooned with these night stills, to catch the ambient moisture in the atmosphere.
>
> Fairly frequently, a storm at sea blows a high wind inland, forcing clouds to overtop the Western Mountains. When they push inland, the flora awaken, collecting as much of this airborne moisture as possible.
>
> Castrobancla's night stills make use of hanging sheets of a polymer cloth, which electrostatically collect the fog droplets and absorb them like a sponge. An electric discharge releases the stored moisture all at once. A night still can collect enough water of a day to meet the daily water needs of 1D people.

## The Amarjan Basin

A fertile basin, the location boasts extensive gardens, open reservoirs of water for irrigation, and a leisure complex in the northeast comprising a dirt race track for sandpod racing, a soccer pitch, tennis courts and a polo pitch. Race days are highly popular, and Castrobanclans can watch live televised sporting events or buy tickets to attend in person.

The Groy Gardens of Castrobancla just northwest of the city wall provide cool, shaded leisurely walks during the day; and the uncultivated part of the basin, just beyond the small agricultural areas supporting the city, are oases of life, with plenty of wild native flora and fauna for naturalists to study.

## Highport

The travel guides point out that “Highport orbits Amarja,” but they do not specify what Highport looks like.

Highport is, in fact, on the airless surface of Candra.

Candra has 1/6 of Amarja's gravity, and has the characteristics B-200-333-C. Highport is serviced by a seemingly unending fleet of small craft, mostly 50-ton and 100-ton modular cutters, a fleet of workhorses which also serve the other planets in the system and even make regular freight runs to and from the mainworld.

Highport has a semi-autonomous mostly human population, which hold elections every five years. About that time, someone always resurrects a petition to rename the base “Alpha” and the modular cutter fleet “Eagles,” but the petition always keeps getting voted down. This has become somewhat of a tradition among the bored personnel who make Highport their home.

## Spaceport

South of Castrobancla are the buildings and landing pads of T'pol Spaceport.

The only vessels which arrive at the port are commercial small craft flights. Modular cutters deliver regular freight runs to and from Highport. A Maglev rail terminus adjoins T'Pol. Cargoes go by Maglev freight train to Preev Theenas, 1200 kilometres to the east.

A passenger service also takes Travellers to and from the capital.

Beyond T'Pol Spaceport's landing pads lies the Great Amarjan Desert.

## The Great Amarjan Desert

The Great Amarjan Desert, extending beyond the Amarjan Basin, is a vast, sandy expanse stretching towards Preev Theenas. It is almost uninhabitable.

Only nomadic tribes dare to cross the desert. They are mostly aliens – [[#Bandaluk]] bandits, a weird human cult of Awareness-using psions, and one pride made up of the [[#Settlers|native aliens]] who supposedly built Castrobancla.

## Desert Survival 101

Every Amarjan child learns how to survive in the desert, virtually from the time they learn to walk.

Travellers who crash their vehicles, or who have to cross the desert on foot somehow, had better already be experienced in desert crossings to avoid a rapid, painful death.

### Hazards

The major hazards of the Great Amarjan are low humidity, scouring winds and temperatures which fluctuate wildly between extremes of heat during the day and extreme cold at night.

### Survival

Travellers who must cross the desert must follow some basic guidelines.

_Planning_ – Travellers must prepare a travel plan and lodge it with a friendly contact in the city, including arranging for regular communications.
_Preparation_ – Include at least one satellite comm, a desert survival emergency kit (including a locator beacon, hand mirror, folding shovel, medicines and solar panel to charge one's kit) and plenty of spare parts for the vehicle.
_Knowledge_ – Know and respect the area. Water is scarce in the Great Amarjan, but it can be located and accessed. Recon skill allows Travellers to locate groundwater sources by tracking the behaviour of animals, and Survival skill can identify succulent plants which can be a source of liquid water.
_Desert Survival Protocol_ – Travellers should stay with their vehicle. The priority is to seek shelter, then water, and attempt communication with the outside world.

Satellites in orbit routinely scan the Great Amarjan and other wildernesses for travellers who get stuck, and an active locator beacon can be pinpointed by the satellite network within 1D minutes anywhere on the planet.

If Travellers have no vehicle, they must travel at night while the air is cool. If Travellers have access to stillsuits, they must be worn at all times.

Survival skill checks in the desert suffer a Bane due to the extreme hardships of life in this arid environment. Natives have a Boon on Survival checks instead.

# COMING TO CASTROBANCLA

## Arrivals and Departures

Access to the surface of Amarja, to Castrobancla and to Preev Theenas is strictly controlled. Travellers must dock at Highport, go through Processing - routine Customs and medical screening, taking no more than 1D x 10 minutes, usually – and and then book commercial passenger flights to T'Pol Spaceport.

At T'Pol, passengers and cargoes are given a second, more cursory, check and sent on to their destinations, whether they be to Castrobancla or to Preev Theenas. The timeframe is 1D seconds. If the Traveller succeeded in a Diplomat roll, T'Pol Customs will just wave the Traveller and all baggage straight through.

_Reduce Waiting Time To 1D minutes:_ Difficult (10+) Admin (1D x 10 seconds, Soc)

_Skip The Queue:_ Very Difficult (12+) Diplomat (1D x 10 seconds, Soc)

### Booking A Commercial Flight

Commercial small craft flights from T'Pol run on tight schedules; typically, two flights leave each Amarjan day. The standard cost is Cr 250 each way, plus a Cr 100 flat fee for personal luggage up to a limit of 100 kg.

### Freight And Cargo

Cargoes destined for Amarja are offloaded at Highport and transported to the  urface by the vendor, at the vendor's expense. T'Pol has a fleet of cargo-carrying small craft, and the charge is a flat fee of Cr 100 per ton transported.

### Illegal Entry

It is difficult to get into Castrobancla illegally, but it can be done.

#### Ocean

Flights can come in low and drop their passengers over the ocean. The Western Mountains provide a blind spot for ground radar, shielding incoming flyers from T'Pol Spaceport.

Timing is critical – the flights must come in at a time when Highport's telescopes are no longer in line of sight of Castrobancla, which is usually midnight during the new moon. Naturally, that is the time when security patrols are on full alert.

Patrols in Air/Rafts and boots-on-the-ground patrols routinely cross the mountains on the lookout for incoming flights, and lookout points are strategically placed to face the ocean in all directions; but the watchtowers are isolated from the city, lookout duty is boring, and the guards can usually be bribed with luxury goods to look the other way.

Sometimes, the guards can be bribed with promises of luxuries to their loved ones – many a guard has taken a smuggler's shilling in exchange for new kidneys for their child or to waive their loved ones' gambling habits.

#### Mountains

A small drop pod sent down from orbit to the mountains could theoretically slip beneath the radar before it breaks up after re-entry. The passenger of the drop pod must make a HALO drop. Once on the ground, the Traveller then has the task of crossing the heavily-patrolled Western Mountain passes to make their way into the Amarjan Basin undetected.

Travellers who try this had better make certain that their bribes are up to date.

#### Desert

Foolhardy or desperate Travellers could attempt to make their way over the desert to Castrobancla. When, not if, the rescue patrols from T'Pol SAR Station find them, they are processed, given a statutory Cr fine and their equipment confiscated, and sent on to the city.

After exposure to the Great Amarjan for more than a few days, most people are usually grateful to be found.

_Charm One's Way Past Customs:_ Very Difficult (12+) Persuade, Soc, 1D seconds

_Bribery_: Average (8+) Persuade, Soc, 1D seconds; bribe must be worth 2DxCr 100 minimum to get their interest

#### Leaving Amarja

In contrast to arrival, the only way off Amarja alive is to book a commercial small craft to the [[#Highport]].  T'Pol's departures lounge is a hotbed of activity, with free passengers mingling with chained, scowling prisoners and guards: Amarja has no prison facilities.

There is one other way off Amarja, and that is in a box. Sometimes. The desert has lots of hungry scavengers, and there is a thriving [[#Dvora]] population in town.

![[CasAss-049.jpg]]

The capital, Preev Theenas

### Entering Castrobancla

About 250,000 adults call Castrobancla home. The city occupies about 860m<sup>2</sup> divided into 25 districts known as [[#City Wards|Wards]]. Each Ward performs a different function within the city, and each Ward has its own character.

The first sight, on debarking from the maglev from T'Pol, is an ugly steel-and-concrete architectural prolapse surrounding the maglev station. This area, The Vestibule, serves as an unofficial third Customs check – this time by the army of beggars and urchins waiting to descend upon the unwary visitors.

The Vestibule is a three-storey area lined with shops facing inwards. The ground floor atrium is an open market, stalls selling tourist souvenirs and maps. Everything on sale in the Vestibule is legal: no weapons, drugs or contraband of any sort.

The Vestibule is the place for tourists, mostly human. Restaurants, cafes, fashion stores, jewellers – many of the visitors come here during the day and rarely venture into the city proper.

The interior is always brightly lit at night. Power for The Vestibule is provided by solar panels lining the outer walls, and every store has internal batteries to store electricity during the day for use at night.

A Routine(6+) Streetwise (Int, 1D seconds) check can differentiate between ordinary beggars, con artists and professional pickpockets.

The same Streetwise roll can identify that all of them are part of one operation being run by a single gang: the Welcome Gang.

#### The Welcome Gang

On the Castrobancla street scene, the Welcome Gang currently has the run of the Vestibule. The Welcomes run the fake map scams, the bootleg goods and the (moderately-priced) protection racket in the area.

The Vestibule is a lucrative area; a lot of tourist wealth gets spent in this place alone, mostly for the usual designer goods, the latest vids and streams and the latest in fashionable clothing and accessories. The Vestibule is as up to date on fashion trends as anywhere in the subsector, and the free-flowing cash makes this place a most desirable patch among the gangs of the city.

- _Discern real goods from fake_: Average(8+) Streetwise (1D seconds, Edu).
- _Discern which of the many maps on sale are actually useful_: Average(8+) Streetwise (1D x10 seconds, Edu).
- _Spot a pickpocket_: Average(8+) Streetwise (1D seconds, Int).
- _Recognise gang identifications_: Routine(6+) Streetwise (1D seconds, Int).

#### Jitney Depot

Once past the Vestibule, Travellers arrive at the jitney depot, where ranks of small buses wait to take passengers to their destinations.

Most travel in town is provided by jitneys, wheeled taxis and the City Monorail Service which covers the whole city and runs on the hour, all day. All vehicles are solar-driven.

##### Costs

Single: Cr 3 for a one-way journey anywhere in the city, by jitney or monorail.

Day Pass: Cr 5 per day allows travel by either jitney or monorail. Passengers are issued with contactlesspass cards bearing photo IDs. Passengers top up their cards with credits at the station; each monorail and jitney stop carries an automated payment machine which transfers money from the passengers' bank accounts into their travel passcards.

Each day's Cr 5 payment is deducted from the pass card, the first time that it is used each day.

#### Tucs and Taxis

The contactless passcards can also be used to pay for taxi rides, but taxis are more expensive: Cr 5 for a destination within the district, and Cr 10 for destinations within the city, but in other districts. Taxis from the Vestibule cost Cr 5 to any district within city limits.

Tucs, on the other hand, are a lot cheaper. Tucs are open-framed solar-powered electric rickshaws which can take up to five passengers anywhere for 1Cr , no matter how distant the destination within the city.

Tucs have some natural disadvantages. They are unarmed, unarmored, exposed, slow and they cannot carry much cargo.

But they are reliable, and they are cheap; and the drivers take their passengers directly to where they need to go, no questions asked and no extra charges for going the long way around.

# WITHIN CASTROBANCLA

## City Wards

Castrobancla is a sprawling city, covering several square kilometres. The city is divided into a total of twenty-five districts or Wards, ranging from opulent upper-class establishments such as Watertown down to barely-functioning slums such as the mostly-human Apetown shanty.

Some areas are virtually abandoned and left for the encroaching desert.

The Wards are named after Amarjan historical figures. The table below lists each Ward, along with its type, neighborhood quality and a summary of what makes it unique.

## Neighbourhood Characteristics

### Neighbourhood Quality

Each neighborhood has a Neighbourhood Quality rating, from A through to X.

Opulent neighborhoods have clean streets, impressive buildings and next to no visible crime. The worst neighborhoods may contain ruins and wreckage, with wandering wild animals and lurking criminals.

The quality of the neighborhood affects the locals' reactions towards the Travellers as well as the type of encounters that happen to them. This is reflected in each Ward's DM.

The quality ratings are listed in the Neighbourhood Quality table on the following page.

#### Neighbourhood Quality Table

| Quality | Description                                                               |  DM |
| :-----: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-: |
|    A    | Palatial splendour, opulent, streets kept mostly clean                    |  +3 |
|    B    | Outstanding Beauty. Built to impress. Traditional. A bit hidebound        |  +2 |
|    C    | Average. Plain streets. Average people live here                          |  +1 |
|    D    | Functional. Most industrial areas. Plain buildings, offices. Working area |  -1 |
|    E    | Poor. Ramshackle buildings, rough and dirty streets                       |  -2 |
|    X    | Virtually abandoned to criminals, animals and encroaching desert          |  -3 |

### Neighbourhood Encounters

Each neighborhood has a chance of an encounter in the street or an event.

Some sorts of encounters are far more likely in some neighborhoods than in others – poor neighborhoods are more likely to have criminal or police encounters, and religious encounters are far likelier in Bremani's Ward of temples than, for example, the Trong slum Ward. The Encounter Type Table, below, has a column listing the type of encounter, or the event.

Each neighborhood has its own type of [[#Encounter Type table]]; for example an Encounter Type table for Industrial Wards, as compared to Slum Wards or the Administration District. And each encounter type has its own table, to randomly generate encounters – for instance Police Encounters, Criminal Encounters and, of course, Things Get Rough and Things Get Messy where events degenerate into a fight or something big and awful happens.

#### Encounter Type Table

Referee: Travelling between locations within a Ward, roll 10+ on 2D for an encounter. Consider making the roll 8+ or 6+ for more frequent encounters. Add the Ward DM to this roll to determine the encounter type.

Feel free to insert something plot-related: an Enemy and a retinue of hostile thugs turns up, demanding a showdown, or a Contact steps out of the crowd to warn the Travellers to take another road because things are about to get messy in this part of town. The Patron's Enemies might hear of the Travellers' acceptance of the Patron's job, and they might send thugs to dissuade them. Justice could catch up with them and an Agent might try and detain them to return them to face trial for past crimes.

|   2D  | Type Of Encounter     |
| :---: | --------------------- |
|  0-3  | [[#Things Get Rough]] |
|   4   | [[#Things Get Messy]] |
|  5-6  | [[#Criminal]]         |
|  7-8  | [[#Military]]         |
|  9-10 | [[#Emergency]]        |
| 11-12 | [[#Police]]           |
| 13-15 | [[#Casual]]           |

#### Reactions Table

> [!note] Referee
> Castrobancla is a city filled with aliens from many different parts of the galaxy. They have all come here for various reasons – but in this part of the universe, human beings are rare. Unless they are military, cops or undercover cops, in which case they are not rare, but they are not welcomed with open arms, either.
>
> If the Travellers' party has an alien, a SOC 8+ roll, with Diplomat as a +DM, will yield the revelation that the locals will look to the alien to speak for the party rather than the humans. It does not take an INT roll to realize that putting the alien forward as the team's face person is probably the best idea in this town.

Reactions range from absolute, roll-initiative hostility to total adulation. Roll here to determine the reactions of the encountered being or beings. Roll 2D and add either Diplomat, Persuade or Streetwise to this roll:-

|  2D | Reaction                                                                                                             |
| :-: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  2  | Hostile. Combat initiated on 8+; the Effect on a Difficult (10+) Persuade check can be applied as a DM to this roll. |
|  3  | Abrupt. Beings cut off contact with the Travellers permanently.                                                      |
|  4  | Contemptuous. Beings regard the Travellers with distaste. All checks on skills involving SOC suffer a Bane.          |
|  5  | Distant. Beings want Travellers kept at arms' length                                                                 |
|  6  | Neutral, Guarded. Beings are wary and disinterested.                                                                 |
|  7  | Neutral. Beings are merely disinterested.                                                                            |

|  9  | Close. Beings are interested in the Travellers.                                                                      |

[^toogood]: Referee: Too good to be true. Roll 2D: a natural 2, these aliens are deceptive and their affection is a ruse, setting the Travellers up for something.

#### Things Get Rough

Sometimes, tensions run high. The Travellers are not the most trustworthy types; and if they are out on the street for any length of time at all, there is a chance that someone will take exception to their presence.

When the “Things Get Rough” entry appears in the encounters table, an action is initiated which results in combat. Roll for the inciting event, then begin a combat scene and call for initiative rolls.

Roll 2D:-

|  2  | Ambush: The first sign is the rush of feet charging towards the party ...                                                                                             |
|  3  | Sniper Attack: The red laser dot gives little warning.                                                                                                                |
|  4  | Something Explodes: A vehicle nearby goes up. 6D in 5m blast radius, 3D from 5m – 10 m, 1D from 10m – 30m.                                                            |
|  5  | Drive-By: The streetkids are the first sign, when they duck for cover.                                                                                                |
|  6  | Grenade: Someone just threw something at the feet of the party! Roll 1d: 1-4 smoke grenade to distract them from the main assault; 5 incapaciating gas; 6 HE grenade. |
|  7  | Betrayed: The peaceful encounter turned hostile in an instant as weapons emerge.                                                                                      |
|  8  | IED: As for 4, but the object is innocuous, like a football or a dropped basket of shopping                                                                           |
|  9  | Diversion: Something distracting like being swarmed by streetkids for 1D combat rounds, long enough to set up the assault on the Travellers                           |
|  10 | Harangue: Locals stop what they are doing and cross the street to harass the Travellers in an alien tongue                                                            |
|  11 | Angry Mob: Someone yells something and points at the Travellers. A hostile, rowdy crowd starts to form and approaches the Travellers                                  |
|  12 | Mistaken Identity: Reroll for the hostile encounter, but the beings think that the Travellers are somebody else                                                       |

#### Things Get Messy

Things do not always go according to the plan: and for the Travellers, these include events which spring up to bar their path or draw them away from their missions. This table covers events which are not exactly criminal or violent activities. Some involve police, emergency personnel or even the military. But all of these events have one thing in common. They are not on a small scale.

These events take up a whole street, and inevitably the Travellers end up getting caught up in the event, costing them time at the very least.

|  2  | Powderpuffed!: The Travellers are [[#powderpuffed]]. See below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|  3  | Fire! The Travellers are drafted in to help put out the fire, taking 1D x 20 minutes of concerted effort. The Travellers will be delayed 2D x 10 minutes and all will suffer fatigue, but all reactions by locals in this Ward will be at +4, +6 if they act selflessly and dive into the fire to save lives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|  4  | Building Collapse: As 3 above, but a building has collapsed, due to shoddy construction industry regulations and a relaxed attitude towards safety. Rescue efforts are underway to get people out from the debris.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|  5  | Vehicle Crash: A small ground vehicle has crashed into another vehicle. Average (8+) Medic (Edu, 1D minutes) checks can save lives; if the Travellers stop for 2D x 5 minutes to render assistance, reactions from the locals gain a +DM as for 5 above.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|  6  | Vehicle Crash: A small ground vehicle has smashed into a wall. The driver is alive and being tended to on the side of the road, but there is extensive property and vehicular damage. The road is blocked both ways: the Travellers will be delayed 2D x 5 minutes until they can work out an alternative route to their destination.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|  7  | Contagion: Something is making people in the street fall sick. The government troops are already moving to cordon off the area: make a Difficult (10+) Athletics (DEX, 1D x 10 seconds) check to get out fast.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|  8  | Police Action: The cops are moving to block off the whole region. Unless the Travellers make a Very Difficult (12+) Athletics (DEX, 1D x 10 seconds) check to escape with the citizens being evacuated, they will be locked inside the Ward and unable to leave it for 1D days.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|  9  | Desert Fever: A form of mass hysteria, [[#Desert Fever]] grips dozens of locals and drags them out of their offices, residences – even their beds and vibe showers – and compels them to wander through the streets, heading towards the city limits and the endless Great Amarjan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|  10 | Mass Hysteria: The locals are swept up in some sort of mass hysteria, and are pouring out of their homes or premises onto the streets. Roll 1D: 1-2, frenetic dancing; 3-4, uncontrollable laughter, weeping and screaming; 5- 6, residents are scared by a persistent rumor that the government is hiring human vagabonds to forcibly displace residents from their homes as a prelude to knocking down their houses for gentrification. Roll 2D: on a natural 2, the Travellers are blamed, and the result changes to 11 below. |
|  11 | Riot: The street erupts into a riot, and the Travellers get caught up in the fighting. Roll 1D: 1-2 – the party is split, and meet up after 1D hours' delay; 3-4 – the police arrive and the Travellers must make a Difficult (10+) Athletics (DEX, 1D minutes) roll to escape their dragnet; 5-6 – in the midst of the fighting, something new happens: reroll on this table to see what it is. Ignore rerolls of 11.                                                                                                             |
|  12 | Stormy Weather: The city is put on high alert: satellites have reported the approach of a sandstorm. Everyone must head for shelter. The sandstorm puts the Travellers out of action for 1D hours until it clears.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

##### Powderpuffed

The Travellers are regaled by a colourful, noisy parade of revellers who swarm them with light and gaiety. During the encounter, several handsful of colourful powders are thrown over the Travellers in gaudy clouds of colour. This powder is actually a potent contact hypnotic.

- It affects the Travellers within 2D minutes.
- An END 8+ check can stave off the onset of symptoms for a further 1D + Effect minutes, long enough to seek safety and obtain help, but only if one is aware that one has in fact been drugged.
- Symptoms are euphoria (INT and EDU-based checks suffer a Bane), disorientation (initiative is 2) and weakness (attack rolls suffer a Bane).
- Continued exposure (dosed for more than 1 combat round) leads, 1D minutes after initial symptoms, to unconsciousness which lasts for 2D x 5 minutes.
- There is an antidote, called Mother's Milk ; it is a white liquid solution obtained from the same native plant which is ground up to make the hypnotic powders. The locals are immune because they will have drunk the antidote beforehand. Mother's Milk does not immunise the consumer from the euphoria.

> [!note]- Powderpuffing and Castrobanclan Street Customs
> The Travellers could well be knocked out by the “revellers” if they are unaware of their intent. Travellers who do lose consciousness should wake up in dread of the thought of having been robbed, or even missing a kidney. Such fears are misplaced. Powderpuffing is only used in Castrobancla by the natives (almost exclusively the pleasure-worshipping Pelacur) to get rid of undesirables in a non-violent way. The locals are frequently amused by the sight of unconscious military types left lying on the side of the road, covered in coloured powder. Local custom dictates that passers-by only ensure that the unfortunates be comfortable. Robbing a helpless victim of a powderpuffing (first-timers are called “initiates”) is considered taboo.
> Powderpuffing is best deployed to bring about the rapid end of a scene. If you wish to give the Travellers a saving grace, have an Ally or friendly [[#Pelacur]] offer them a stiff drink of Mother's Milk beforehand to immunise them from all but the euphoric effects of the drug, which lasts 1D + (2D x 5) minutes if Mother's Milk is consumed.

##### Desert Fever

Desert Fever is a form of psychological disease unique to Amarja. It can strike at any sophont mind. Sane, sober magistrates and doctors have fallen victim to it, as have drunks and street trash.

Sufferers exhibit three stages of symptoms. In the first stage, victims stop socialising with their peers and begin to spend their free time staring out of windows and viewports, particularly those windows with a view of the desert. All actions and initiative rolls suffer a -1 DM due to listlessness.

Second Stage Desert Fever brings unnatural thirst. Most people who come to Castrobancla feel thirsty as a matter of course, but second stage sufferers crave the sweet taste of water. All actions and initiative rolls suffer a -3 DM due to the distraction.

Third Stage Desert Fever compels the victims to leave their homes and wander aimlessly towards the desert. Victims are unprepared for desert conditions, and will not last long out on the Great Amarjan.

Medical science cannot work out what causes Desert Fever; but cases have been known to rise briefly for 1D weeks following desert sandstorms.

#### Criminal

The Travellers can encounter five levels of criminal activity in Castrobancla:

- non-violent individual crime
- violent individual crime
- local organised crime
- regional organised crime
- city-wide organised crime.

They can either bear witness to it, participate or would-be victims.

Non-violent crimes include drug dealing, prostitution and hustling (street con games for scratch creds). More violent crimes include mugging, robbery and street harassment. Gangs and crime organizations occupy the higher levels on the table, and these crimes tend to be rackets – numbers rackets, brothels, trafficking, drug distribution, money laundering, protection and so on.

The cards are rigged: the hustler has a Boon on his checks, and the Traveller has a Bane until he wins his first round. Minimum wager Cr 20 per try.                                                                                                                                           |

|  7  | Gang thugs come up to the Travellers, displaying weapons in an attempt at intimidation. “You just turn around, now, and go back the way you came. Capeesh?” There is one gang member for each member of the party, plus 1D. Combat skills are equal to the Travellers.                                                                                                                                         |

|  9  | A group of organised crime gang members approaches the Travellers in a fancy black ground car.

#### Military

Castrobancla has a small military Garrison, nicknamed The Desert Pioneers. Their official designation is the 135th Amarjan Battalion.

Little more than expensive mercenaries, the military are a mostly-human group who keep themselves to themselves in Menilak Ward.

Menilak is a typical small military base, containing administrative buildings; facilities for ammunition production and storage, weapons production, fuel storage, recreation, research, training, vehicle maintenance and storage; a commissary, a mess, a BX/PX, fortifications, hospitals, housing, utility structures, a military intelligence base, a massive mountain SAR (Search and Rescue) unit second only to the SAR base at T'Pol, schools and museums.

Menilak also houses a command centre, FIBUA and CQB training grounds and one external training ground located in the Great Amarja Desert, where SAR (Search And Rescue) simulations are conducted in conjunction with the unit stationed at T'Pol Spaceport. A second external training ground in the mountains was recently abandoned – cause unknown.

The Desert Pioneers are currently scouting for a new mountain location for their second training ground.

The Desert Pioneers do not patrol the city. They are only called out within Castrobancla in the event of an emergency such as a possible WMD attack or on request from the local government to quarantine an area in the event of an outbreak of disease. The last time they were called out was to quarantine Horbali District during an outbreak of an unspecified disease.

Units are teaming up with T'Pol's SAR unit and T'Pol are coordinating the search                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|  12 | As 11, but it is not a Noble's ship that has crashed, but an alien vessel, species and intent unknown. The units depart for the desert ... but none return. 1D hours after the units' departure, the Travellers' comms will ring. A high-ranking government Patron has a mission for them ...                                                                                                                                                                                         |

#### Police

This table is for encounters with cops – beat patrol constables, heavy weapons or military police.

Castrobancla's police patrol the streets in pairs. There are numerous divisions - uniforms, enforcers driving around in solar-powered police ground cars; the gold shield divisions of Homicide, Robbery, Vice, Cybercrime, Internal Affairs and Undercover; and then there are specialized units, namely Riot Control, SWAT, K9 and the Flying Squad – a literal airborne squad patrolling the city with grav belts and police Air/Rafts.

Each Ward has a Precinct. Precinct One, the central precinct from which Despatch communicates with all city units, is located in Big Hill Ward.

Add the Effect of an Average (8+) Streetwise (SOC, 1D seconds) check to this roll to adjust it in the Travellers' favour, if necessary.

|  2  | Protection Racket: These two cops are corrupt. They demand Cr 500 each to stop them arresting the Travellers on a trumped-up charge. If they are arrested, it is a Very Difficult (12+) Advocate (SOC, 1D hours) roll to get acquitted of all charges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|  3  | Trumped-Up Charges: Some corrupt cop wants the Travellers jailed for some reason. It will cost Cr 1D x 1000 to free them on bail, or Cr 1D x 500 right now in the cop's back pocket to look the other way. An Average (8+) Streetwise (SOC, 1D seconds) roll can get the bribe reduced to Cr 1D x 500, but there is a chance of 11+ on 2D that the cop might not like so small a bribe and put you through the grinder anyway. Getting out with all charges quashed requires a Difficult (10+) Advocate (SOC, 1D hours) check.                                                                                                      |
|  4  | Sting: The operation seems too good to be true. The Travellers learn that there are unclaimed valuable artworks from Old Terra being sold at auction. The problem is, the auction is a sting – and the Travellers are marked for arrest as soon as they walk in the door. It's those gilt-edged invitation cards they received from that dodgy would-be “Ally.” Make an 8+ INT roll to see through the Ally's deception.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|  5  | Entrapment: The “Patron” is an undercover cop looking to bust some shady criminals so he can make a name for himself in the precinct. He can be defeated with an Average (8+) Deception (SOC, 1D minutes) roll; unless the Effect of this roll is 3 or higher, the humiliated cop becomes an Enemy of the Travellers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|  6  | BOLO: One of the Travellers has been identified at the scene of a crime, and is wanted for questioning by police                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|  7  | Mistaken Identity: As 6, but the cops are looking for the wrong person; they are after somebody dressed like the Traveller.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|  8  | Murder: There has been a murder. Uniformed cops are already cordoning off the area, and detectives are going about asking all suspects, including the Travellers, where they have been in the last D6 hours. Roll on [[#Murder Table]]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|  9  | Raid: The premises where the Travellers are situated are suddenly raided by a mob of uniformed cops, who set about arresting everybody in sight. Roll on [[#Raid Table]]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|  10 | Cordon: A street has been barricaded, and uniformed police are blocking access to the area. An Ally of the Travellers, working as a police consultant, is standing outside the mobile command & control unit not far from the cordon. The Travellers can render assistance, if they wish; all they have to do is contact that Ally and get her to let them in. The mission is big. There is a credible threat to the city in a warehouse just down the street. Someone had phoned in, claiming that they have planted a weapon of mass destruction capable of levelling Castrobancla. The threat is real. Roll on [[#Cordon Table]] |
|  11 | Collecting For Widows And Orphans: Uniformed police are out on the street, not patrolling this afternoon but collecting for the Police Widows & Orphans fund. A successful Difficult (10+) Recon (INT, 1D seconds) check reveals that confidential informants are passing on data to the cops in their collection tins, data wafers wrapped in five-cred notes. One of the confidential informants is one of the Travellers' most trusted Contacts.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|  12 | Frustrated Cops: The police just watched as a smirking man in a suit committed an egregious crime out in the open, and drove away in a shiny black ground car sedan bearing diplomatic plates. They will quietly pay the Travellers Cr 5000 to find some way of ending that criminal's diplomatic immunity status – a Difficult (10+) Diplomat (SOC, 1D days) check.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

#### Emergency

This table is for encounters with emergency personnel - medics, paramedics, search & rescue personnel and firefighters.

Castrobancla has regular civilian emergency personnel. Each Ward can also recruit passers-by with varying degrees of usefulness, depending on experience and Leadership skills.

> [!warning] Fire
> Fire is a danger in the city. Water is in high demand and short supply, and a combination of high temperatures and lot humidity can lead to uncontrolled and devastating conflagrations.

> A permanent ban on naked flames exists in the city. Candles are mostly to be found in temples, and most lamps, lanterns and flashlights are powered by solar cells or manually charged, with batteries to allow storage of power enough to last for days between charges if necessary.
>
> Most citizens use the light from their comms units in any case.

##### Search & Rescue

Castrobancla's SAR units are based in, and operate from, the SAR Garrison in Menilak Ward. The SAR units train in mountain rescue; but they also cross-train with paramedic and fire units to form specialized building-collapse rescue units for patient retrieval from beneath fallen structures.

Military units also offer civilian training in Hazmat operations, for those disasters where a hazardous material spill of some sort requires specialized equipment, training and decontamination procedures.

This cross-training with civilian units gives all SAR units a uniquely paramilitary outlook.

SAR units are listed by number and their specialized function is also listed, e.g. “39 Canine,” “21 Structural Retrieval” or “05 Hazmat.” The units operate in three long shifts, covering Amarja's full day.

Not quite a full military and not fully civilian, Castrobancla's search & rescue units are proficient in urban and wilderness rescue, disaster relief and combat rescue operations.

Every unit must include at least two trained medical personnel with Medic 1 or higher, and at least one expert with Engineering (Civil Engineering) or Engineering (Combat Engineering) level 1 or higher.

One unit is even further specialized – a canine unit, requiring all personnel to have Animals skill to handle the trained dogs in sniffing out patients.

#### Casual

This table is for casual encounters with the ordinary citizens of Castrobancla. The irony is that Castrobancla's citizens are anything but ordinary. The types of people encountered in this  table come from civilian walks of life: ex-Merchants, Rogues, Drifters, Scholars, Entertainers, even Nobles and a few Psions. All of them are citizens, and they all have a story to tell.

|  2  | The KIS walks up to the Travellers, arms at his side, asking if they can talk – he, or rather his employer, is the Patron        |
|  3  | The cops are arriving: the Travellers have to get out quickly, or they could end up being blamed for the carnage                 |
|  4  | As 3, but they are then called by their Patron that the KIS works for him: and that they are needed for a job not even he can do |
|  5  | The Patron reveals that they are needed to protect the KIS against a local gang leader who has taken out a MCr 1 contract on him |

The deal is sweet; the Travellers earn Cr 10000 each for their help, and an Ally whose network of Contacts   across the subsector has just become theirs.                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|  4  | The [[Air-Raft]] is old, and begins breaking down, forcing the Travellers to land in a hostile part of town for urgent (Average (8+)) repairs. They have to stand guard over the vehicle as it is being fixed. One of the team must also monitor the Patron's health: on 10+ on 2D, the Patron goes into shock and must receive medical attention, as for 2 above |

|  1  | The shopkeeper's youngest son, aged 14, has just been bitten by a sandsnake, and requires immediate medical attention – an Average (8+) Medic (EDU, 1D minutes) check with a TL 10 medkit handy, a Very Difficult (12+) check otherwise                                           |
|  2  | The sandsnakes can be drawn out by the Travellers if they have Animals 0 skill at all: the shopkeepers have no Animals skill whatsoever and are clearly suffering from the -3 untrained penalty                                                                                   |
|  3  | Sandsnake venom is deadly, but used properly it can save lives during surgeries. There is a Cr 1000 bounty for every sandsnake collected alive. Referee: There are 1D sandsnakes. Add 1 to the roll, and tell the Travellers that there could be that many sandsnakes in the shop |
|  4  | The sandsnakes are actually harmless, non-venomous wrigglers; snakes which mimic sandsnakes in appearance. Worthless                                                                                                                                                              |
|  5  | The sandsnakes are hungry, and the prey is the colony of mice which has taken up residence in the shop cellar. Leave them for 1D days to eat the mice, and the snakes will be torpid and easily handled, solving both pest control problems at once                               |
|  6  | The family are actually serial killers. The sandsnakes are trained to attack; the victims are locked in the cellars to die, and the family loots the dead victims' bodies                                                                                                         |

|  1  | She is a comely distraction. The real photojournalist is gathering evidence with a stealth drone with a long focus lens                    |
|  2  | This is her first assignment. Her cynical editor has told her to use her own initiative, but he does not expect much from her              |
|  3  | She is trying to pin a murder charge on one of the Travellers, whom she suspects of being her big sister's murderer (she is wrong)         |

|  1  | His story is genuine; he spent three years in transit in a low berth along with three other people, sealed inside a freight container with a long-term power plant. The others were released because their ransoms were paid – his was not; but pirates retrieved him, revived him and recruited him for six months, until aliens attacked and abducted him while he was on shore leave, his first for almost four years |

##### Begger In Distress Table

|  1D | Result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| :-: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|  1  | This is a compassion test set by the Patron they are due to meet. The beggar is real, but he has been hired for this purpose by the Patron. If they stop to render assistance, the Patron will give them the job; otherwise, the Patron declines |
|  2  | The beggar just lost his only friend to Desert Fever. His buddy is in Stage Three and wandering out into the sands. If the Travellers go out and rescue the beggar's friend, they gain the beggar as a Contact                                   |
|  3  | A real hard luck case. The beggar lost his home to a fire, his wife to Desert Fever and his two children to a vicious court case. He has no job, nowhere to go, and he has Engineering (Jump Drives) 5                                           |
|  4  | The beggar turns out to be a drunk Noble who has been powderpuffed.  If the Travellers can sober him up, his DNA confirms that he is the long lost son of the Duke of this subsector                                                             |
|  5  | The beggar is genuinely ill and needs medical attention, but he is a  skilled con artist, who later tries to bilk the Travellers out of Cr 200 with an entertaining story about a cache of lost treasure somewhere out in the mountains          |
|  6  | The beggar was wounded by an agent of the Enemy and left for the Travellers to help him. As they help, the agent takes images of the Travellers to identify them for something nefarious later on                                                |

##### Mother With Children Table

|  1D | Result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| :-: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1  | None of the children are hers. The “mother” is a pathological child thief who abducts other people's children. If they identify her and bring her to justice, the Travellers can net a substantial reward of 1D x Cr 100000 from across the sector |
|  2  | The mother is trying to cross the busiest road in Castrobancla, and she could do with some assistance                                                                                                                                              |
|  3  | The mother is lost; the children distracted her at a crucial point, and she has no idea where she is                                                                                                                                               |
|  4  | The mother is too distracted by the children to notice a large truck barrelling towards them, out of control                                                                                                                                       |
|  5  | One of the kids gets separated from the rest, distracted by a bug; the mother pushes on, seemingly heedless of the missing six-year-old girl                                                                                                       |
|  6  | The mother is carrying everything she and the kids own. She would like to book passage off-world for her and her kids, before her abusive and violent husband, a soldier from Menilak, realizes that she has gone                                  |

#### Sandsnakes

Native to Amarja, both sandsnakes and wrigglers (a non-venomous species of Amarjan snake which mimics sandsnakes) love eating mice, particularly in human shelters such as grain storage facilities.

#### The Kubotaur In The Suit

The urban legend has persisted since the earliest days on Old Terra, in a city called New York: sometimes, a mysterious ex-spy takes on the role of the city's guardian, helping out ordinary people in trouble. According to the urban legend, at one time the city's guardian used to have to take out classified advertisements in the local broadsheets, proclaiming himself an “Equaliser” – and as humans reached the stars, the role diversified and became an equal opportunity job. Males and females; trans individuals; alien and human alike became guardians of the cities they lived in.

Castrobancla's suited guardian angel happens to be a dapper Kubotaur.

There is another rumor, that the guardian no longer needs to take out classified advertisements any more. Some higher angel is now looking after him – an artificial superintelligence, no less, monitoring every surveillance device, smartphone, comm unit and CCTV camera in town. And sometimes, that AI likes to drive around this vigilante with a fine love of theatre, housed inside an extraordinary black TL 15 ground car - that talks.

### Wards and Notable Landmarks

![[CasAss-113.jpg]]

Every Ward of Castrobancla has its own personality and character, and each has different populations of aliens in different proportions. Each Ward has their own agendas, problems and conflicts, and despite their differences they all communicate with one another, officially and unofficially.

Castrobancla has many landmarks and locales for the Travellers to visit. Here are the most memorable.

### The Markets

Each Market Ward is home to many souks, bazaars, and open market spaces. Every Ward sells a different range of items. Difficulties of Broker and Persuade skills will vary, depending on the legality and rarity of the items sought.

The four Market Wards are Coredini, Darab, Elafa and Joski.

| Market Type | Broker       | Difficulty |                  Availability                 |
| ----------- | ------------ | :--------: | :-------------------------------------------: |
| Coredini    | Goods, water |  8+ to 12+ | Legal (8+) / Illegal (10+) / Restricted (12+) |
| Darab       | Grain        |  6+ to 8+  | Legal (6+) / Illegal (12+) / Restricted (14+) |
| Elafa       | Livestock    |  8+ to 10+ |           Legal (8+) / Illegal (12+)          |
| Joski       | Meat         |  6+ to 10+ |           Legal (6+) / Illegal (12+)          |

#### Notable Markets

##### The Throvisko

(Coredini)

Castrobancla's largest open air market, this hexagonal open space runs day and night. Anything can be bought here, from survival equipment to deep-fried edible plondak nuggets.

This is the best place in the city to meet up with Allies and Contacts, and even to arrange meetings to settle disputes with Rivals and Enemies; the law forbids any kind of open combat, or weapons of any sort, in the Throvisko.

_Reduce list cost of an item 1D x10%_: Difficult (10+) Broker (Int, 1D minutes).
_Negotiate with Rival or Enemy_: Very Difficult (12+) Persuade (Soc, 1D x10 minutes).

##### The Ice Market

(Coredini)

Coredini's Ice Market is a delightful place to come for business. Every stall in the cool, shady bazaar sells some form of water ice, whether it be large blocks encased in modern TL 10 insulating material to keep them cool from the sun or wooden barrels of crushed ice, little more than snow, packed in straw.

One litre of liquid water costs Cr 1 from the liquid water markets. Ice from the Ice Market costs Cr 10 per 10kg block.

##### The Steel Market

(Coredini)

The Steel Market, on the edge of Coredini, is the place to come for knives, swords and blades of all sorts. A regular public auction is held every two weeks to bid for blades of notable historical value.

##### The Life Market

(Joski)

The Life Market does not look like a regular bazaar. It just looks like an unassuming grey concrete office block with darkened windows.

The building never seems to have clients entering or leaving the building; the glass automatic door never seems to open; and yet the lights are always on.

An Average (8+) Streetwise (SOC, 1D minutes) check reveals that the Life Market trades in people; according to the word on the street, the Market runs a fleet of converted Type R and Type T Starships in the subsector which have been converted into slave ships.
![[CasAss-116.jpg]]

### Centres Of Power

Officially, Castrobancla only has one centre of power, the Ward called Big Hill. City Hall and various government buildings are sited here. Zoning, the education syllabus, the placement of new libraries and streets, scheduled road maintenance and many other aspects of Castrobancla's bureaucracy are controlled from here.

#### Tulia House

(Big Hill)

Tulia House is named after a local hero who died saving the city. This large five-storey rotunda is where newcomers are processed – alien and human. The atrium is a riot of alien species from all over space.

Every new visitor coming here needs to be processed, and a pass issued if they are visitors. Processing can take 1D days, but this process can be expedited.

_Cut The Red Tape:_ Difficult (10+) Admin (Soc, 1D hours) check.
_Bribery:_ Very Difficult (12+) Persuade (Soc, 1D minutes) check and Cr(2D x 50).

#### Public Library

(Big Hill)

Even in the Far Future, there is still a use for old-fashioned books. These books are rare, and old, and cannot be removed from the premises. If someone needs to take out the data stored on a book, a scanned facsimile can be electronically uploaded  nto the borrower's comm unit before leaving.

Poring through old paper correspondence is laborious and time-consuming, and not for the impatient. Sometimes, the books and documents have to be consulted visually, because the facsimiles might have flaws and lacunae, or dirt on the lens might obscure something vital.

_Use the Library's search facility to locate a book_: Routine (6+) Admin (Edu, 1D minutes).
_Read the book for a vital clue_: Average (8+) Language (Edu, 1D x10 minutes).

#### Parliament Building

(Big Hill)

The seat of local government, this is the place to come if a Traveller needs official backing for a project, whether it is obtaining planning permission for something or to register an event such as a birth, marriage or death and obtain official documentation about the event.

This is the site of the quarterly government seizure auction. Every three Amarjan months, the government posts listings of various lots which have been seized in police actions and tax seizures, as well as properties which have been taken by the State on declaration of bankruptcy with the government as chief creditor and even the estates of people who died intestate, without a will.

Three main categories of items are of interest to Travellers: seized cargoes, weapons and surplus ships with heavily marked-down mortgages. If Travellers are looking for a way off planet but they have no ships of their own, this is a good place to buy a new ship; though since the seized ships are berthed at Highport on Candra, they would still have to get a commercial flight to claim their new property.

The successful bidder for a ship is designated the owner, and the ship usually has about 2D ship shares plus the Effect of an Average (8+) Broker (Int) check, which the owner is encouraged to distribute among the other members of the crew.

Remote ship share certificates are often auctioned in lots at the knockdown price of Cr500 per share; each ship share represents an investment in a remote ship trading somewhere in the galaxy, and grants the owner an annual stipend of Cr1000 per bought share. Certificates are typically sold in bundles of 2D per lot.

Arrange a meeting with a government Patron: Average (8+) Admin (Soc, 1D minutes).
Put in a bid at a government auction: Opposed Difficult (10+) Broker (Soc, 1D x 10 seconds) check versus an opponent's Broker skill and Soc DM.

### Unofficial Centres of Power

Big Hill is not the only centre of power. The spiritual, entertainment and military centres of Castrobancla contain factions which vie for prominence with the ruling governmental forces of Big Hill; and behind the scenes, criminal organised crime rings and the larger gangs control the corrupt and ensure that they get a percentage of the action, however small. Bremani Ward, Voitila Ward and Menilak Ward all host pressure groups which congregate on Big Hill to debate important matters relevant to each Ward. Each election year, representatives from each Ward are sent up to Big Hill to stand for seats in the Council, and representatives from these Wards not only have disproportionate power compared to the others, but most of the time the choice of whom to elect for Mayor is made from a selection of candidates from these three Wards, competing with the Big Hill local candidates.

#### Bremani Ward

Temples

Bremani Ward occupies a narrow wedge shape extending down the shallow northern flank of Covaline Hill. Bremani is adjacent to Big Hill to the south. The main boulevard descends in a straight line to the largest temple, right at the bottom – the imposing Temple of Sorrows, a temple dedicated to the death gods of almost every known species.

This Ward is, as the name implies, devoted to temples to the gods and pantheons of dozens, scores of different alien species. Religion in Castrobancla is considered to be a form of celebration of diversity, as well as a source of communal bonding rituals to assert various communities' identities.

Some religions are not represented in this Ward. The Kubotaurs' State religion proved to be too rowdy and judgemental; the Bandaluk were considered too great a risk, and nobody wants to know what the Dvora worship.

Human shrines or temples are also absent. After discovering that humans were apparently incapable of tolerating even one another's religions, it was felt appropriate to keep the fractious human religious communities from ever  stablishing a foothold within Castrobancla's city limits.

Other than the temples, this Ward is famous for its parades. Many times during the year, one religion or another is always hosting a parade. Some are grim, funereal affairs, while  others put Terra's Mardi Gras festivities to shame.

##### Notable Landmarks

###### Temple of Sorrows

(Bremani)

Sooner or later, everybody dies. The Temple of Sorrows celebrates death in all its forms with joyful celebrations marking the lives of the deceased.

As with all religions in Castrobancla, the Temple is supported by contributions in credits, which pay for the contributor's own eventual funeral in advance. Offerings to the gods are also made – but in common with Castrobanclan culture, these offerings are insubstantial, taking the form of songs and chants sung by professional mourners (the fees also support the Temple).

The Temple is also the official location of the region's extensive mortuary. Here is where the Office of the Coroner conducts autopsies and evaluates found archaeological treasures for their worth and for legal determinations of treasure trove status for artefacts.

_Break bad news to a relative_: Difficult (10+) Diplomat (Soc, 1D minutes).

###### The Last Chance

(Bremani)

Tricksters appear in every culture. The Last Chance is a place which celebrates the Trickster figure, whichever form he or she takes. This is the one temple where even human deities are celebrated; all Tricksters.

Trickster is traditionally a teacher; and The Last Chance teaches moral and ethical lessons to young children in the sunlit courtyards, even as their parents play in the basement casinos under their feet.

The act of wagering is considered an offering. The bigger the gamble, the better the offering – and the games are absolutely fair. Travellers are more likely to lose their shirts in the casino – but those few who come from the Temple wealthy are looked upon as having Trickster's favour today.

_Performing an offering_: Special (see below) Gambler (Int, 1D seconds).

###### Trickster Wager Table

| 1DxCr10000 |   Formidable (14+)   | Stake+2DxCr10000 |

### Voitila Ward

Paradise

The artists' quarter of Castrobancla, Voitila houses a huge variety of theatres, art galleries, museums, cafes and coffee houses, tearooms, Pelacur entertainment centres and alien brothels.

The few State-legalized recreational drugs from a very restrictive list can be consumed in various drug dens dotted here and there in this Ward. All of the city's licensed drug dens are in Paradise, where the authorities can keep tabs on them.

Paradise also hosts Castrobancla's only licensed fight dens.

#### Notable Landmarks

##### Fight Dens

Fight dens are small clubs set up expressly for the purpose of providing a venue for people to try out their combat skills on one another. They function like pickup joints, but instead of going to these dens to pick up people for sex, the action in a fight den is somewhat more violent. Internal venues for fight dens include fight pits, televised in the main room. Wagering is always heavy in the main rooms of fight dens.

There are strong restrictions. Both participants must enter fight pits freely and of their own free will. Both must be sober enough to give consent. Fighting is with Melee Combat skill only. Medical costs are the responsibility of all participants. Management can declare any given fight's outcome null and void. No rematches. No grudges. If participants want to have a rematch outside afterwards, that is their problem. Not the fight den owners'.

Like other places of quasi-legal entertainment in the city, Travellers first have to learn of their existence: Difficult (10+) Streetwise (Soc, 1D hours).

Next, they have to find someone who is in good standing with a fight den to vouch for them: an Ally can do this.

After the introductions, first-time arrivals must be vetted – which usually means that somebody hacks into their local bank account to see how many credits they have. And finally, if they are allowed in, there is usually a small annual fee to be paid, typically Cr1000, as well as a nominal Cr25 cover charge for each visit.

Particularly persuasive Travellers can sweet-talk management into giving them a try: Very Difficult (12+) Persuade (Soc, 1D minutes). They still have to pay all costs.

##### Golden Peacock

This entertainment facility, as the Pelacur manager describes it, caters to the females of the alien community – those aliens which have a female gender. The entertainers in this establishment are unique to Castrobancla: all are human males.

The manager, Salima Yashay, caters to a very exclusive market, namely rich alien women who wish to be entertained by male humans. Some species consider the aliens to have very dubious tastes, akin to sleeping below their station or slumming it – but they pay well, the men are handsome and the club has a generous pension scheme t take care of their entertainers in their old age.

Travellers who wish to speak to a particular client on some business or other, possibly to secure her patronage, may have to join this club as an entertainer and to perform for her. The client's fetish is to be waited upon hand and foot by an English butler dressed in an obsolete Terran style, and served an ancient Earth delicacy called “cucumber sandwiches.”

_Entertain the guest_: Routine (6+) Steward (Soc, 1D x10 minutes).

_Dance a full set on stage_: Average (8+) Art (dance) (End, 1D x10 minutes).
![[CasAss-134.jpg]]

### Menilak Ward

Garrison

Castrobancla's patrols and militia forces live, train and drill in Menilak. Militias, both human and alien, are trained in desert and mountain Search and Rescue (SAR) operations, as well as in the usual investigative, forensic and arrest procedures and police martial arts techniques.

#### _Notable Landmarks_

##### FIBUA Simulator

(Menilak)

A small area of Menilak has been set aside by the Garrison to train the militia in fighting in a built up area. The security forces routinely train in this area, which simulates the tight, cramped conditions, poor lighting and short lines of sight of most of Castrobancla's buildings.

Travellers with previous experience of fighting in close quarters can earn good money teaching new recruits how  to handle themselves under these circumstances.

_Train new recruits_: Average (8+) Leadership (Int, 1D weeks).

_Lead recruits in an actual FIBUA situation_: Average (8+) Tactics (military) (Int, 1D minutes).

##### North SAR Station

(Menilak)

In addition to T'Pol Spaceport's Desert SAR station, Menilak has its own, smaller unit, a fleet of Air/Rafts and a unit of flyers equipped with grav belts, based at the north wall. Their remit is rescuing people who are stranded in the mountains.

_Lead a SAR team to the mountains_: Average (8+) Leadership (Soc, 1D hours to 1D days, depending on the weather).

_Crash investigation_: Difficult (10+) Investigate (Int, 1D days)

### Upper Class and Mercantile Wards

![[CasAss-144.jpg]]

#### Upper Class Residential Wards

The three Upper Class residential wards of Castrobancla are Furiban, Todor and Voitila. Voitila, also known as Paradise, is covered above.

Furiban, Todor and Voitila are clustered together in one large area, adjacent to Sonchi – the playground of the affluent who live in the three palatial residences.

The three Wards could not be more different, but all three have one thing in common – opulent splendour.

#### Todor Ward

Watertown

Todor Ward is a small buffer region between Furiban and Todor, a few streets across. Within that region the streets are clean and tidy, the buildings look more impressive than those of Ward Two, and despite the severe water conservation effort there seems to be a lot of water out in the open, in public fountains, pergolas and similar water features in every street.

Yet despite that, the place is mostly out of bounds for even the thirstiest individuals, and there is a good reason for all this seeming waste and extravagance.

The waters are alive with The Host.

Only Chevals and those willing to become Chevals come anywhere near the open waters of Watertown. Chevals patrol the area, looking to catch drunken or stoned tourists who might happen to wander into the area by accident. Most beings who take a dip in the waters quickly learn the gravity of their error.

Rich customers who are aware of the Host's presence make their way to the region, hoping to take a dip in one of the many sacred wells and become temporary Chevals. Usually, they do so in order to make use of the Host's famed restorative capabilities. There is a long waiting list to become a medical Cheval, and The Host charge exorbitant fees for the privilege.

#### _Notable Landmarks_

_Antorick Street (Todor)_

The place to go to meet the most influential Chevals. Almost as many art galleries and fancy bars can be found here as Paradise. All these establishments cater to Chevals, who enjoy the high life just so the Hosts riding them can enjoy the delights which meat bodies can experience.

The bars here are the only place where one can arrange to meet a Cheval Patron.

_Seek a Cheval Patron:_ Average (8+) Streetwise (Soc, 1D days).

Consult with the Host to obtain an ancient memory: Very Difficult (12+) Persuade (Soc, 1D days).

Nazuchac House (Todor)

A place where candidates for medical implantation go to have the Host implanted inside them and become medical Chevals.

The central feature of Nazuchac House is a huge pool. People seeking implantation either enter the pool on their own, or are gently lowered in if they are incapable. The ceremony of implantation is a very solemn affair, as is the reverse procedure where the Cheval is lowered into the waters so that the Host can extricate itself.

_Implantation fitness check_: Average (8+) Medic (Int, 1D minutes).

_Calm a terrified candidate_: Difficult (10+) Persuade (Soc, 1D minutes).

#### Furiban Ward

Furiban Ward is exotic, affluent and magnificent. Rows of gleaming condos tower into the sky, and palatial residences nestle between them. Wide roads for ground vehicles jostle with the extensive monorail network which connects the rest of the city.

Beneath the shelter of the palm trees, Amarja's richest alien citizens live out their retirements in splendour.

#### _Notable Landmarks_

_Celeresteral Avenue (Furiban, Sonchi)_

This avenue connects Furiban and Sonchi. High-profile ground vehicles speed along this road in both  directions. If there was a speed limit here, it could not be imposed.

Celeresteral Avenue offers the best quality designer goods in the system, at top of the range prices. Luxury handbags could cost the buyer upward of Cr 5000 – and the handmade plondak leather shoes are the talk of the subsector.

In the trade game, Brokers here exclusively sell (never buy) the following cargoes: Advanced Electronics, Advanced Vehicles, Luxury Consumables, Luxury Goods. Purchase prices are at +10% on standard listed prices. See “Speculative Trade & Smuggling,” Traveller Second Edition Core Rulebook , p. 210, and “Trade Goods,” p. 212.

#### _Notable Landmarks_

_The Duchess of Furiban Gardens (Furiban)_

There is a human woman, “The Duchess,” who lives in a beautiful palace with a garden renowned for the fragrances of its plants. Each day, she sits in the shade in a different corner of the garden, reading and drinking lemon juice.

The “Duchess” is a former resident of Apetown, plucked from a life of poverty by the estate's true owner, a Pelacur heiress, and put in the gardens simply so that the human's natural scents can complement the fragrances of the plants surrounding her.

She is only hired for her aroma.

The life of the “Duchess” is strictly controlled and monitored. Certain foods which can alter her body chemistry, and thus her aroma, are forbidden; and during times of great hormonal fluctuations, she is not permitted out of the house.

The “Duchess” is not permitted romantic liaisons, because the hormonal alterations caused by pregnancy would be catastrophic.

It is rumored that there have been many “Duchesses” in the past, and that the estate's owner has grown tired of each of them in turn.

The rumor also mentions that nobody has ever seen a former “Duchess,” and points out the wood chipper round the back.

#### Mercantile Wards

Castrobancla has three major mercantile Wards: Groy, Morva and Sonchi. Amarja's best Brokers, speculative traders and markets are found in these three Wards. They are all the same in appearance: wide boulevards lined with palm trees, skyscrapers of glass and steel gleaming in the sunlight and hotel resorts with rooftop access only to residents with AAA credit ratings and bank accounts in the billions of creds.

Castrobancla would have a marina, if it could; but it is a long way from any significant body of open water.

#### _Notable Landmarks_

##### Jeweltown

(Morva)

The Brokers in this part of the city deal exclusively in gemstones and jewels. Everything from engagement rings to components of lasers and Jump drives.

Travellers wishing to engage in speculative trading in gemstones and crystals can get the best bargains here.

On the Trade tables, row 31, Crystals and Gems, can be bought and sold here. The Tons column to determine the mass of the consignment is 1D x 6 here rather than 1D x 5. All other columns' values are unchanged.

##### The Great Spinward Hotel

(Sonchi)

The most famous landmark in Castrobancla, the Great Spinward Hotel is also Castrobancla’s biggest building.

Dominating the wide, palm-tree lined central boulevard that is Sonchi Ward's Celeresteral Avenue ( the place to shop if your Social Standing is 13 or higher), the Great Spinward is a truncated glass-sided pyramid nearly a kilometre high and a full kilometre across at ground level.

Entry to the Great Spinward on the ground floor is via the grand entrance, which spans over a hundred metre gap; the building extends several levels below ground level, and the gap extends all around the building. The staff tend to live out their lives in the levels below ground level.

Rows of elevators take residents for a dizzying ride along the interior surface of the building; they get to see the city falling away far below them.

Weekly costs for accommodations are the equivalent of Jump-2 High Passage, weekly, for most residents. If residents do not mind mingling with the staff, accommodations below ground can be arranged, at the equivalent cost of Basic Passage.

##### The Groy Gardens

(Groy)

An entire Ward devoted to growing the fruits and vegetables to feed the citizens, Groy is an emerald in the desert, twinkling with reflected light from the silver fabric geodesic domes dotted here and there.

Apart from the Gardens, which cost Cr 50 to enter and which include a theme fair with free rides (access all day), Groy Ward has three features of interest to Travellers – an ornamental maze, an exclusive restaurant and a resort hotel attached to the restaurant.

##### The Maze

(Groy)

An ornamental maze of what look like long hedges, taller than a Kubotaur. At first glance, the hedge may look like an extravagance, consuming precious water. But a closer inspection reveals a surprise.

The “bushes” are artificial, each leaf being a photosensitive cell either producing edible amino acids for protein synthesisers, medicinal drug precursors, glucose and other sugars or simple electricity.

Each leaf requires nothing more than atmospheric oxygen, carbon dioxide and nitrogen, and trace elements which are tilled into the soil.

Here and there in the Maze are clearings, where people can sit on benches in the shade of date palms. The Maze is a comm dead spot. Surveillance equipment cannot monitor people in or into the maze, making these locations nearly the perfect place to meet Patrons or to conduct other kinds of clandestine meetings.

##### The Palate

(Groy)

The most exclusive restaurant in Castrobancla, The Palate serves an extensive range of foods, notably fruits and vegetables grown in the gardens.

Only Travellers with a minimum Soc DM+2 can enter the restaurant, unless they are staff (minimum Steward 2 skill). Staff can earn a minimum of Cr 100 per level of Steward per hour.

##### The Grand Groy

(Groy)

A resort hotel catering to rich clients. A child free atmosphere for adult couples. Rich single clients and their companions can also enjoy the resort, with discretion being the watchword.

The clients of the Grand Groy do not like scandals, and they hire staff to make sure that the outside world does not hear of them when they happen.

### Slum and Industrial Wards

![[CasAss-144.jpg]]

In contrast to the upper class and mercantile Wards, the slum and industrial Wards are studies in grinding poverty. Sandy streets and grimy buildings radiate despair, even as barefoot children play street soccer in the dusty alleyways. The streets come alive at night with various peddlers, selling drugs, illegal weapons or goods, or even themselves.

The beating, rotten heart of the slum districts are the insulae. Based on the housing model used in ancient Rome, these are crowded, teeming islands of Humaniti: sophonts of all species pressed cheek to jowl in aromatic camaraderie.

The industrial areas are even more arid and eerily silent, save for the eternal hum of cooling fans and heavy machinery, and the carcinogenic aura of industrial chemicals.

#### _Notable Landmarks In Slum Wards_

_Insulae_

Living quarters for the unwaged and the indigent, these buildings offer cramped living conditions, basic toilet and washing facilities and a sunlit inner atrium which also serves as a common area.

The locals are very close-lipped if they see strangers poking around looking for people. Even if a resident  personally cannot stand one of their neighbors, she will likely hold her tongue rather than rat out on him to strangers.

Money and trust are both scarce and at a premium. Earning the trust of a resident requires that the Traveller do something to help, either one person or the whole insula.

_Treat a neighbor's sick child for free:_ Average (8+) Medic (Edu, 1D minutes).

_Help plant a communal garden on the ground floor of the atrium:_ Average (8+) Engineering (civil) (Str, 1D days).

#### Schools

Children need education, no matter what their species. Castrobancla  provides free education to all residents.

Travellers with experience as teachers or instructors can take the opportunity to teach the residents' children; this helps to earn the trust of the parents, some of whom could be influential in other ways – they might help arrange a meeting with an elusive official who happens to be a family relative, or they might become Contacts or Allies, or even speak on the Traveller's behalf if the Traveller is attempting to join a network or group of which the parent happens to be a member.

_Lead a class as a substitute teacher_: Very Difficult (12+) Leadership (Soc, 1D x 10 minutes)

_Lead a class on a field trip_: Difficult (10+) Leadership (Soc, 1D hours)

#### The Slum Wards

##### Colambra Ward

Apetown

Colambra Ward is known as “Apetown” to the alien residents, as it is where Castrobancla's human population lives.

Apetown's human accommodations include hotels, tenements, hostels and similar locations catering for the needs of humans. Even in Apetown, however, the aliens still outnumber humans.

##### Horbali

Horbali has the least dense population of any Ward in Castrobancla. The reason is that the entire Ward suffered a great depopulation about five years ago.

The Night of Desert Fever is already an urban legend: seventy-five percent of Horbali's five thousand population went from healthy beings directly to Stage Three sufferers of Desert Fever in the space of a terrifying eighteen hours.

The affliction seemed to spread to people in the street who were touched, or even breathed on, by affected victims; and to this day, the region remains in a state of semi-disuse. Even prospective landowners seeking to gentrify the Ward are loath to come anywhere near it.

##### Penadra

Penadra suffered an equally dreadful disaster twenty years ago, when the Great Fire of Penadra swept the region. Ramshackle old buildings of dry wood went up like matches, and thousands of lives were lost.

##### Prem

This is not the largest slum ward in Castrobancla, but it is the poorest, and  it is also a disputed area claimed by at least two street gangs who vie nightly for control of this turf.

##### Ropalaya

Ropalaya means “together” in the Bandaluk language. Ropalaya is the Bandaluk Apetown.

##### Sombar and Trong

Sombar and Trong are slightly more affluent than the other slum wards, because of their closer proximity to the industrial Wards, meaning that many of the residents have jobs and regularly commute to work in those Wards.

Trong is the biggest slum Ward, and also closest to the city centre; Trong is also the site of a controversial proposed gentrification project, initiated by two humans from Preev Theenas, who want to convert the place into an upper class Ward for affluent humans only.

This, naturally, is not going down well with the mostly-alien residents: Kubotaurs, Bandaluks and Settlers.

#### Industrial Wards

Castrobancla's principal manufacturing and processing industries are clustered in its Industrial Wards: Ankhati, Balam, Bloumt, Modarya and Wosarita.

The city's main water reclamation plants operate in these Wards, along with various manufacturing concerns, warehouses and commercial premises.

The city's more fragrant industries operate here – mostly in the field of sewage processing, although there are also a number of cadaver recycling facilities and abattoirs, among other similarly odorous industries.

Wastes, both human and alien, are collected here and processed, their moisture content separated and shunted to the irrigation reservoirs. The desiccated solid material and chemical remnant has a variety of uses, mostly in agriculture.

Even corpses have their uses, once the moisture has been extracted and the remains reduced to useful chemicals.

##### Waste Management

Castrobancla takes waste management very seriously. A lot of water is expelled with one's droppings and tailings, which must not be allowed to go to waste. The city has established a unique system to ensure the hearty compliance of the population in keeping track of their water usage: bodily deposits are considered a taxable contribution, to be deducted from one's bills. It is therefore vitally important for both visitors and tourists visiting the city's many public facilities to get a receipt.

#### _Notable Landmarks_

_Dvora Colonies (Balam)_

The Dvora live exclusively in Balam, in buildings which they keep scrupulously clean. First-time visitors to a Dvora building could understandably confuse them with hospitals, because the clean, sterile scent of antiseptic is ubiquitous.

Gaining the trust of the Dvora requires the same sort of kid gloves approach as for handling a sullen, distrusting slum Ward insula population. In order to receive, first one must give.

_Free medical care:_ Average (8+) Medic (Edu, 1D minutes).

_Gentle persuasion:_ Difficult (10+) Persuade (Soc, 1D days).

_Fertiliser Manufacturing Plant (any Industrial Ward)_

This is where most of the alien and human bodily wastes end up. After extraction of the moisture content, the remaining solid chemicals are purified and crystallised out into raw chemical fertilisers. A surplus is always stockpiled to be sold on to the gardens of Preev Theenas or to be shipped offworld. Efficient solar panels and a wind farm mean that there is always plenty of energy available for the intensive extraction process.

The stockpile needs a strong security presence. Everybody is well aware of the potential for these compounds to be made into a bomb.

_Track down thieves who stole a shipment of fertiliser_: Very Difficult (12+) Investigate (Int, 1D days).

_Crack a thorny energy efficiency problem that can increase productivity 1D x10% with no extra outlay cost_: Formidable (14+) Engineering (chemical) (Int, 1D weeks).

# OUTSIDE CITY LIMITS

The Travellers' adventures might take them outside the city limits, and to other locations on Amarja. The following are the likeliest places they will go to.

## Farmlands

Beyond the outskirts of the city are farmlands which feed the inhabitants of the region. A combination of open grain fields irrigated from beneath with water pumped from the open reservoirs and rows of vast agricultural grow tents, the farmlands are the breadbasket of the region.

## Arena

A long, wide road connects Castrobancla and The Arena, the sports resort which is a virtual city unto itself. Regularly scheduled sporting activities include competitive polo, where riders jockey six-legged Bravari camels across a dusty field; track and field athletics; a soccer pitch; and the sandpod racetrack, where ground vehicles race one another through the hazardous terrain of the foothills of the Great Western Mountain range.

Competition is healthy; Entertainers with an athletic or sporting background, psionic Adepts who have mastered Awareness and augmented cyborgs vigorously pursue  he rich cash purses on offer, and all events are televised in the various casinos and gambling dens in Paradise and broadcast to every home with a vid screen.

![[CasAss-176.jpg]]

> [!note]+ Amarjan Soccer and Polo
> These ball sports are played with the same type of ball: a solid sphere of hard rubber, about the size of a human head. There is a rumor that for centuries, the Settlers who predate all the other races on Amarja used to play soccer and polo, not with a ball, but with the decapitated heads of executed prisoners.

## The Mountains

Sharp and rugged, the mountains are treacherous terrain to the unwary. Native wildlife still lives in these mountains, including prowlers, predatory carnivore/hunters the size of a bobcat, with razor sharp claws and teeth, which track prey in packs like wolves. Mountain passes connect the ocean side to the inland regions, and there are too many for them all to be patrolled.

Moreover, the soft rock is prone to chemical erosion by the water, meaning that the interior is riddled with an extensive and entirely unexplored cave network. There is a rumor that at least one hazardous cave network cuts right through the mountains, offering an underground passage for Travellers hoping to bypass the mountains and avoid the patrols altogether.

## The Great Amarjan Desert

In the depths of the desert, animal and sentient encounters will be few and far between. Survival is a critical concern. The bleached bones of the unwary lie everywhere.

### The Great Nomadic Tribes

Many different nomadic tribes cross the Great Amarjan Desert, just as there are nomads who cross the Great Oceans and the Great Western Mountains. Nomadic tribes frequently assist T'Pol or Castrobancla's SAR units in searching for survivors of crashes. The largest nomadic tribes are:

- The Pride (exclusively [[#Settlers]])
- The Great Family (mixed, mostly [[#Bandaluk]]s)
- The Wanderers (mixed, mostly [[#Dvora]] and [[#Pelacur]])
- The Ascetics (a cult of human Adepts, psions who specialize in Awareness)

## The Maglev Railway

There are many ways to get to Preev Theenas – most notably privately, via [[Air-Raft]] or whatever other air transportation is available – but there are no roads between the cities, and most traffic to Preev Theenas is by air or by maglev.

Most of the locals cannot afford to hire either a ship's boat, an Air/Raft or a grav belt to allow them travel to the capital; so if they want to get to Preev Theenas (or if they live in the capital and want to get to Castrobancla or further afield to T'Pol [[#Spaceport]]) the maglev is the only option available to them.

Prices are cheap – the maglev only costs Cr 50 one way.

#### The Great Oceans

The Great Western Ocean, just past the mountains, is one of three oceans on Amarja. There are vast, untapped treasures present in each of these three bodies of water, not least of which is the water.

Floating desalinization plants dot the oceans, converting the saline seawater into drinking water for the thirsty population of Amarja. These plants are floating cities unto themselves, with bars, schools, hospitals and greenhouses for growing food.

There are persistent rumors of sunken Ancient cities and building complexes lying undisturbed on the bottom of the oceans for millennia.

# RESIDENTS AND VISITORS

Castrobancla is a city of a thousand faces, practically none human.

Aliens permeate every sector of the city, even Apetown. They all want the same things everybody else does – trade, wealth, power, love, meaning and purpose.

Fortunately, this is the kind of city which can accommodate those wishes. _Any_ wishes ... for a price. Here are some reasons for wanting to come to Castrobancla.

## Family

Not every alien species understands the concept of family. Of those species, some have a very fixed idea of what family is – and they frown upon those individuals who have a looser definition of the term. Castrobancla does not care if the partners in the relationship are not married, or both the same gender, or from different species; what is done in the privacy of one's own home, between consenting adults, is nobody else's business.

## Acceptance

The government of Castrobancla has a very strong stance on multiculturalism, tolerance and diversity – to wit, the city is firmly in support of those ideals. Racial intolerance of any sort, from hate crimes to hate speech, is not only frowned on – it is a sackable offence if an official is caught espousing such views in public. Hate group organisers find their protests routinely besieged and dispersed by a very zealous police militia comprising a wide variety of different species. Intolerance has no place in Castrobancla.

## Love

Something about the city or its environs calls out to the Traveller. Even if he is a traveller who spends his days wandering around the cosmos, when he thinks of Castrobancla he thinks “Home.”

## Refuge

Castrobancla is a good place to lie low, if you have the right connections – and the money to keep the right people looking the other way. There are plenty of safe houses in Castrobancla, and not just for criminals.

Humans and aliens on Witness Protection, runaways and people fleeing abusive relationships find Castrobancla to be a great place to go to ground. If you dig deep enough here, no-one will find you.

## Opportunity

Castrobancla is one of the best places to go to hear rumors, to grow new alliances, to foster new sources of information, to shake off rivals and find ways to make peace with the bitterest of enemies, and to catch the eye of Patrons whose jobs might take the unwary traveller places he has never been to before, but which might pay more money than the traveller has ever seen. If he survives to collect. Most of all, Castrobancla is packed full of rich alien Patrons.

## Last Resort

When the last of the money has gone; when the contacts and allies have all shrivelled up; when the Patrons no longer call; when thereis nothing left; then the streets of Castrobancla open up and welcome those who have nowhere else to go. Castrobancla is the last refuge to those who have reached the end of the line.

### Visitors

#### Vacationing

A considerable number of travellers and wanderers come to Castrobancla to take advantage of the dirt-cheap hotel accommodations. With the promise of good food, good drinks, excellent and exotic entertainment, exciting sporting events in the arena and the finest selection of fashionable designer goods in the subsector, as a resort Castrobancla delivers high quality and seeks to ensure the highest levels of customer satisfaction.

#### Short-Term

Many wanderers and travellers come to Castrobancla because it offers plenty of locations for rendezvous and meetings where privacy can be assured; at least, as much privacy as money can buy.

Quality of privacy is heavily proportional to the amount of money spent.

#### Long-Term

Some jobs require a long-term but still temporary presence. Agents could be operating deep undercover in one of the gangs, or performing surveillance on another State's agents. Citizens could be engaged in building projects. Nobles could be assigned to one of Castrobancla's Embassies. Scholars have their long-term projects, studying the climate or geology, locating mineral deposits out in the mountains or gathering fossils to work up a profile of Amarja's palaeontological past. And Entertainers might have a long-term contract to appear in a theatrical play or just to provide a show in one of Paradise's casinos.

# THE ALIENS

Six alien species grace the city of Castrobancla. One of them, the Settlers, is native to Amarja; the rest, like humans, have wandered far to come to the city.

Settlers are presented here as an NPC species. It is recommended that Referees use Settlers strictly for non-player characters. All the other species are playable by Travellers – even the Host.

The alien races are:-

- Bandaluk – Natural born Rogues with a code of honor and a custom of counting coup.
- Dvora – A carrion-eating species that keeps themselves to themselves.
- Kubotaur – A towering, aggressive species of natural law enforcers.
- Pelacur – An alluring humanoid race with a sensual attraction that humans find absolutely irresistible.
- Settlers – An enigmatic native species to Amarja, they are never seen outside their stillsuits.
- The Host – A sentient symbiotic species which occupies sophonts (those ridden by the Host are known as “Chevals,” never “chevaux.”).

## Alien Character Generation

With the exception of Settlers, Travellers can be drawn from any of the above species. Each species' individual traits are listed, and for some of these alien races the rules for character generation need some modifications.

Bandaluks and Dvora cannot have the option of pre-career education. Bandaluks cannot take the Agent careers; Dvora cannot take military or Noble careers but they do not suffer from the Draft.

Kubotaurs have a natural advantage over others with military careers: the Agent, Army and Marine career paths give Kubotaurs a natural DM+2 on Qualification, Survival and Advancement, but they have a disadvantage as Entertainers: Qualification, Survival and Advancement rolls suffer a DM-2.

Pelacur make natural Scholars and Entertainers, gaining the DM+2 on Qualification, Survival and Advancement rolls in those careers.

Settlers cannot take the Navy or Scout careers, since they require offworld travel which is forbidden to them.

All other career paths are open to them; but as Amarja routinely deports prisoners off planet – a death sentence for the species – a Settler would contemplate suicide rather than be forced into the Rogue career, out of fear of punishment.

#### Personal Development Tables

Some alien races have the option of choosing personal development from certain careers other than the ones they are currently pursuing. They can still choose to roll on the Personal Development table for their current career, if they wish: this is an extra option available to them.

Bandaluks may choose to roll, in any term, on the Personal Development Table for the Rogue career.

Dvora can choose to roll, in any term, on the Personal Development Table for the Scholar or Citizen careers.

Kubotaurs can choose to roll, in any term, on the Personal Development Table for the Agent career.

Pelacur can choose to roll, in any term, on the Personal Development Table for the Entertainer career.

### Bandaluk

Lovable rogues and gentlemen thieves with ugly faces and heavily-tattooed bodies, the Bandaluk are the opposite of the Kubotaur (see below) in many respects. Their homeworld Bandama is another planet with a Hot environment and, like the Kubotaur, the Bandaluk have the Fast Metabolism trait. Like the Kubotaur, the Bandaluk describe themselves as a “warrior race,” and their core beliefs and ethos have strict codes of honor, which do include counting coup as a valid act in time of war – and they are always at war.

Powerfully-built, Bandaluk live where Kubotaur fear to tread. Brokers, wheeler dealers and opportunists, these intimidating aliens move through the streets with the ease of birds of prey in the air. Throughout the sector, the Bandaluk are the species to go to for high-end jobs with big, well-laundered payoffs, relatively little risk and no questions asked. They also maintain whole chains of safe houses for hire.

Bandaluk teams can be used as rivals to the Travellers, enemies or inconvenient NPC threats standing between them and their payday.

Bandaluk are a mature species of carnivore / killers. Their faces are ugly, with skin covered in short, dark fur, solid black eyes with black sclera and no irises, pronounced ears, jutting jaws and mouths full of teeth. Their arms are disproportionately large and very strong, and they are fast on their splayed feet. Their bodies are often heavily tattooed, each tattoo marking some criminal act they performed – and they display the records of their crimes as marks of honor.

Bandaluk tattoos have a language of their own; they mark the time and date of an act of counting coup, often the victim, the nature of the act – theft, kidnapping, assault – and whether the Bandaluk was wounded in the counting coup attempt.

_Characteristics:_ Str +1, End +2, Int +1, Edu -1, Soc -2

_Speed:_ Bandaluk are fast, moving at Speed 10. They have Fast Metabolism (+2).

_Heightened Sense:_ Hearing. Recon and Survival checks involving hearing gain a DM+2.

_Referee:_ The Kubotaur and the Bandaluk have a natural antagonism, akin to some of the old Terran animated cartoons. Put a Kubotaur party in the same room as the  Bandaluk, and stand well back.

In truth, when public incidents like this occur, they are often staged by Bandaluk, who promote the fights on dark social media. The Bandaluk rake in a profit, and they make a point of giving half of the money to support charities set up for the victims of injustice at the hands of overzealous law enforcers. This earns the Bandaluk tacit approval from the Kubotaur, who see no irony in this arrangement.

Crimes such as human trafficking, organised child abuse and blood sport rings are abhorrent to the Bandaluk. Kubotaur and human authorities often anonymously receive word of such rings, along with enough evidence to break them wide open. To the Bandaluk, it is merely good business; it also helps that they are getting rid of  the worst elements and keeping the law off their own backs.

Homeworld: Bandama B-767-834-A

> [!note]+ Honor, Counting Coup and the Bandaluk
> Central to the Bandaluk code of honor is the concept of counting coup. The historical custom of counting coup, acts of bravery in battle, was even practiced on Terra. A warrior counting coup would touch an avowed enemy, then somehow evade the retaliatory blows and escape to return to his lines. These acts of chutzpah were commemorated with marks of renown, and stories about these deeds would circulate for generations.
>
> Bandaluk similarly mark their battles with notches on coup sticks, and also with tattoos on their bodies. Bandaluk prize their ancestral coup sticks, which are traditionally sent to their families upon the deaths of their owners. Bandaluk householders are expected to remember each story associated with each notch on every coup stick they have, and to be able to recite them verbatim. Among the modern Bandaluk, counting coup extends to robbing marks blind, stealing their most prized items and even the occasional kidnapping. The bigger and bolder the heist, the higher the risk, the greater the honor.
>
> The most important aspect of counting coup is that there should be no loss of life involved, and preferably no destruction of material goods either. The aim is humiliation, not bloodshed. If there is bloodshed or destruction, the Bandaluk code of honor demands immediate recompense – which usually means that the Bandaluk who causes loss of property must repay the injured party an amount equivalent to any financial loss sustained. If a death occurred during a counting coup attempt, such as a kidnapping which resulted in the kidnap victim losing his life, the Bandaluk which caused the death must forfeit his own life. If the incident happened while the Bandaluk was involved as part of a team, even a team of beings who were not Bandaluk, honor demands that all the members of the party forfeit their lives to compensate for their failure.

### Dvora

The Dvora (pronounced “d'VOR-zha”) are a humanoid species from Krepla. “Krepla” means home in Dvoric, and “Dvora” means people.

Dvora are squat scavengers and eaters of the dead, with strong jaws and powerful stomach secretions capable of digesting even bone. They resemble small, feathered humanoid lizard persons with powerful jaws and limbs.

Their eyes and nostrils are large, and they have a plantigrade gait (toes, soles and heels on the floor when they walk) with clawed, scaly hands.

Dvora are common in high population worlds, where they are hired as dieners by the local authorities. In this capacity, they are licensed to handle and move corpses, which they treat with great dignity.

Other Dvora have great difficulty in finding jobs in anything but mortuary work. Many end up as Rogues and Drifters, getting work done in unsanitary conditions which they do not seem to mind much.

Unemployed Dvora have a reputation for being pranksters, laying elaborate practical jokes which annoy their victims more than they amuse. Nobody knows why Dvora play tricks like this.

Typical pranks including gluing a businessman's shoes to the floor, breaking into a hospital medical pharmacy and swapping the labels on all the stock analgesics, and triggering the fire alarm of a government building that is not on fire. Curiously, each prank seems to end up saving lives.

Their homeworld is a high gravity hot planet with misty swamps and a dense atmosphere.

_Characteristics:_ Str +2, Dex +1, Soc -2

_Natural Weapons:_ Bite; Dvora bites can be deadly, dealing 1D+3 damage.

_Natural Weapons:_ Venom; Dvora bites inflict a paralysing venom, which is like Tranq Gas in its Difficulty and effects but with an Interval of 1 hour.

_Heightened Senses:_ Sight and Smell. Dvora can smell death and decay. Recon and Investigate skills involving death or decay gain a DM+2.

Referee: Dvora love to sing in chorus. Once in a while, Dvora groups sing long, haunting songs of unearthly alien beauty. Recordings of Dvora choirs from their homeworld are prized.

Dvora are pranksters because they are all secretly Psionic. All of them unknowingly have Clairvoyance, and their pranks are partly due to their unconscious psionic urgings. In fact, their pranks save lives.

Homeworld: Krepla A-987-875-A.

### Kubotaur

The Kubotaur are a towering humanoid species derived from carnivore/chaser stock. Their homeworld is called Origin. It is a hot planet, and the Kubotaur have fast metabolisms.

The Kubotaur describe themselves as a warrior race, with strong codes of honorable conduct in peacetime as well as in war. They are in demand as law enforcement and muscle.

Kubotaur have patchwork skin, irregular plates separated by gaps of thinner skin like a cracked dry river bed. While they have recognizable faces, the nose on a Kubotaur's face is strictly for breathing. Their sense of smell is highly developed; the scent receptors are housed in a cluster of wormlike barbels hanging from the chin, which are in constant motion.

The Kubotaur have a plantigrade gait. Their feet and hands have five digits each, with four fingers on the handswith one more knuckle on each digit  than on human fingers, and one opposable thumb on each hand; and five long toes on each foot.

The Kubotaur have the following traits:

_Characteristics:_ Str +2, Int +1

_Natural Weapons:_ Claws, Teeth (in Unarmed combat, these natural weapons do 1D +1 damage)

_Natural Armor:_ Kubotaur hides are naturally tough, giving them a natural Armor rating of 1.

Heightened Sense: Their facial barbels give them binolfactory scent – Recon and Investigate skills involving scent gain a DM+2.

Homeworld: Origin A-767-998-C Ga Hi Ht

### Pelacur

A near-human species of omnivores, the Pelacur evolved on a garden world, their ancestors' metabolisms switching between omnivore/intermittent and carnivore/lure.

Eventually, they became sentient and formed a civilization which first reached the local planets of their home solar system and then the stars.

When they discovered humans, the humans fell in love with them. Sooner or later, every species that encounters the Pelacur falls in love with them.

This is due mostly to brain chemistry – Pelacur exocrine systems emit a powerful attractant pheromone which makes them nigh irresistible, particularly to humans.

Pelacur exhibit no hair on their heads - not even eyebrows. They do have eyelashes, though. Their bodies are slender compared to humans', with long fingers exhibiting an extra knuckle joint.

Pelacur necks are thinner than humans'. In front of their throats are five paired horizontal rows of ridges, like vestigial gill slits which have long fused shut.

Pelacur eyes have sclera (whites), round irises and pupils like humans', but their eyeballs are larger than humans', with iris colours ranging from violet to pink, deep blue to sky blue, and, rarely, cream. Heterochromia, one iris being a different colour to the other, is common.

> [!info]- Oxytocin
>
> Oxytocin is a hormone generated by mammals and species which have a mammalian analogue. Most species which form societies secrete oxytocin. Oxytocin fosters social bonding and increases feelings of trust. Synthetic oxytocin is used by interrogators to open up suspects to get them to talk. The airborne pheromone secreted by the Pelacur stimulates the hypothalamus to produce more oxytocin, resulting in them always being perceived as being attractive, desirable and highly trustworthy. Not every species is susceptible. Humans, however, are highly susceptible to the Pelacur biochemical allure.

Pelacur have a natural affinity for the Entertainer career. Their oxytocin-inducing pheromonal lure makes them highly sought after as interrogators and recruiters.

Pelacur prize hospitality. They have elaborate ceremonies and rituals celebrating and venerating hospitality. Some of those rituals border on seduction attempts.

Pelacur music and art are highly prized by outsiders. Pelacur tend to brand their art with scents, which identify the artists involved.

_Characteristics:_ Dex +2, Soc +1

_Lure (Pheromonal):_ Carouse, Deception, Diplomat, Persuade and Steward checks gain a DM+2 due to the alluring power of their pheromones. Art involving live performance, such as singing, public speaking and particularly dance, also gain this +2. On the other hand, Stealth suffers a DM-2. The DM is +3 (DM-3 to Stealth) where the sophonts being influenced are humans.

_Heightened Sense:_ Scent. Recon and Investigate skills involving scent gain a DM+3.

_Oath of Celibacy:_ The Pelacur must swear an oath of celibacy while serving in the Agent, Army, Marine or Navy careers. During character generation, any Pelacur which fails his or her Survival roll is assumed to have been  forced into a situation which has resulted in that oath being broken. Instead of rolling on the Mishap table, roll Social 8+ to remain in the career.

Referee: The Pelacur appear to be TL 10, but they are secretly the reason why most species can achieve Jump-4 or greater.

Their homeworld only looks like TL 10, because the Pelacur prefer life at that technological level: individual Pelacur scientists and engineers are quite capable of developing and maintaining devices of up to TL 18 with no difficulty, and they not only secretly developed Jump-4 drives before all the other races, even Humaniti – they developed Jump drives a century before Humans, making the Pelacur a secret seventh Major Race. They just never feel the need to boast.

### Settlers

Settlers are ubiquitous across Amarja. Most of the alien nomadic tribes which cross the Great Amarjan are Settlers.

Settlers appear to be at least half a metre taller then humans; and their appearance outside their species is unknown to outsiders, since they never  leave the confines of their all-encasing stillsuits outside of their homes.

Settlers are intimately tied to their home planet. If a Settler is ever taken out to orbit, they sicken and die within 1D hours. All the Settlers in the universe live on the planet Amarja.

_Characteristics:_ Str +2, Dex +2, End
+4

_Heightened Senses:_ Sense, as in the Clairvoyance ability, usable anywhere on the surface of Amarja, at up to Very Long range. Requires an Average (8+) Int roll (1d6 seconds) to activate. No Psionic Strength cost.

Homeworld: Amarja.

Referee: Settlers have never been seen outside their encounter suits for a reason.

### The Host

This alien species is a symbiotic organism. Colonies of the free-floating unicellular organisms live in suspension in untreated water, where they occasionally infect and hijack the nervous systems of non-sentient lifeforms, controlling their actions and briefly experiencing existence in their bodies before returning to the water to deposit their shared memories with the larger body of the Host.

The Host can pass through the pores of the skin and be absorbed in the mouth of a creature which drinks the water, rapidly establishing itself inside the bloodstream of the creature it is riding by changing its form to resemble blood corpuscles.

Effectively, it turns into sentient blood - and within the bloodstream, the Host can prevent a wide range of diseases and infirmities.

While the Host can occupy non-sophonts, it prefers lifeforms of the level of primates or higher because of their capacity for tool use. Sometimes, when a colony of The Host forms in a pool of water, it attracts primate types just so it can build small structures to store and maintain the water.

In times of drought the organisms go dormant in the soil – they can remain dormant for decades if they have to, is suspended animation in the baked mud, waiting for water.

When a colony of The Host comes into contact with a sentient species, it uses a very different approach. The Host uses the local wildlife to draw attention to itself by using the wildlife to communicate with the sophonts, typically by drawing geometric shapes or even using what writing it knows. The colony indicates that it would like for the sophont to drink some of the water, voluntarily taking in some of the organisms.

Once inside the sophont, the Host body establishes contact within 1D x 10 minutes, explaining what it wants and requesting that the sophont be the Host's eyes, ears and brawn for a time. If the sophont agrees, the Host gets the sophont to bathe in the water, becoming a Cheval.

Life as a Cheval is a strange experience. On melding, the Cheval's and the Host's personalities begin to merge, until they become a strange hybrid between the two.

Hosts reproduce through two methods

- asexual reproduction while in a free state
- sexual reproduction while occupying the bodies of two Chevals.

The infant Host is incubated by the Cheval foetus, which becomes a born Cheval permanently.

The Host reproduces sexually in order to share its genetic memories with others of its kind. That way, the Host retains the genetic memories of previous Host organisms and preserves them even if a Cheval dies.

_Heightened Sense:_ Their Exotic Sense is Life Detection, usable up to Long range. It is always on.

_Cheval Healing:_ The Host can reverse the effects of radiation, diseases and poisons. Disabilities, including neural damage, can be repaired. Genetic diseases can be deactivated, such that they are not passed down to future generations. Congenital defects are corrected.

_Cheval Senses:_ Chevals gain the Host's Exotic Sense for as long as the Host remains in the Cheval. Chevals gain DM+1 to all characteristics for as long as the Host remains. This DM increases the Cheval's racial maxima; this increase remains after the Host has left. This increase is permanent, and can be taken up to three times.

_Referee:_ The Host resets the Cheval's aging clock to age 22 on implantation. Chronologically, they appear no different than they did before implantation, but the former Cheval's physical age reverts to 22 from the moment of implantation. This resetting of the clock remains after the Host has left, but normal aging continues during and after implantation.

The Host also resets the Cheval's psionic potential. If a non-psion Cheval were to receive psionic testing and training immediately after the Host has left, the Cheval's physiological age for the purpose of testing for Psionic Strength would effectively be 18 years old.

Homeworld: A 767 planet somewhere in an unknown part of space, beyond [[Charted Space]]. The Host themselves admit that they have travelled a long way across the galaxy to reach this part of the cosmos.
