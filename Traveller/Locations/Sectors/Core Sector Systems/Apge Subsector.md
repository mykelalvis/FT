The Apge subsector is dominated by the Apge system, which contains over 80 percent of the subsector’s inhabitants. Apge is the capital and is situated along a ring of star systems that are fittingly called the Apge Cluster, which is a tributary of a longer jump-1 main that extends into neighboring Sanches, dipping into the Mekee and Perite subsectors as well.

Duchess Azabaka Ashushashmi of Apge enjoys her role as custodian of a Core subsector but is very sensitive about the status of her world and its importance to the sector. The worlds in the rimward half of Apge are economically dominated by the Iiradu system in the neighboring Dagudashaag sector. Restrained and conservative Apge has a difficult time wooing some of its more impressionable citizens away from Iiradu. The Apgeans are staunch traditionalists who favor a Vilani-style caste society in which everyone knows their place. Conversely, there is a great deal of economic mobility on Iiradu, both up and down the scale. The fact is most Iiraduans do not get rich. Wealth gravitates to a very select few but the stories of immigrants who go there and acquire immeasurable wealth are seductive. Duchess Ashushashmi does what she can to offer an alternative life path in which tradition, stability and service have greater value than obtaining riches. She puts immense pressure on the Apge Bureau of Life, Environment and Resources (ABLER) to ‘get out and spread the word’ about how wonderful the Apge Cluster is and how it is absolutely brimming with economic potential. Despite their catchy acronym, ABLER is in fact a traditionalist-style Vilani bureau, the members of whom would just as soon focus their efforts on the difficult job of managing a challenging planet without the interference of a busybody duchess. However, the duchess is quite persistent and does manage to persuade members of ABLER to take on public-relations missions from time-to-time. The Travellers might encounter these exhausted and unenthusiastic bureaucrats during their visits to the subsector.

The work done at Research Station Beta and the Naval Science Division Regional Headquarters on Sabsee are presented as examples of what can be achieved when Imperial citizens put their personal ambitions aside and dedicate themselves to the greater good. Scientists there are hard at work developing high-tech weaponry systems that are used to defend the Imperium. They are on the verge of a significant breakthrough in the field of fusion weapons technology and are about to introduce the FGMP-16, the smaller, lighter and deadlier successor of the FGMP-15.

Technological innovation has always been part of the lifeblood of Apge. At the dawn of the Third Imperium, Cleon Zhunastu’s patented Fusion Plus technology was first employed in the Azimuth system, where it was successfully used to provide power for a light carrier and squadron of gunships deployed to combat pirates in the subsector. Azimuth is little more than a naval outpost in modern times but its highport is decorated with several mixed-media murals and interactive displays that reprise the battle to the tune of overly dramatic and slightly too loud original compositions from the Apge Symphony Orchestra.

Apge is defended by the 26th Fleet, with squadrons more or less evenly distributed among its worlds. A larger contingent is present at Sabsee to ensure the safety and security of its research facilities.
