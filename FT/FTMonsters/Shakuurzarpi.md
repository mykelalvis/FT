![[Shakuurzarpi_Picture.png]]
[[#Shakuurzarpi]] are sexually dimorphic oviparous amphibians. They are equally comfortable in the sea and on land but typically rest and hibernate in coastal dens. Solitary animals, they meet only for mating and generally avoid contact other than that. [[#Shakuurzarpi]] are brood parasites who lay their eggs in other animals’ nests and dens, and force them to care for the eggs from incubation to hatching. They do this with a specialized talent that enables them to psionically ‘convince’ animals to do the job. [[#Shakuurzarpi]] put this to other uses as well, such as forcing prey to succumb to their attacks or put two species into conflict with each other. Attempts to use it on humans and other animals of higher intelligence produces a mildly unsettling psionic effect but little else.

### To Catch a [[#Shakuurzarpi]]
While the [[#Shakuurzarpi]] is an elusive prey, there are a number of ways the Travellers can get the job done and they are given equipment for various approaches:

- Tranq shot – The Travellers may shoot the animals with tranquiliser darts but there is some concern about how the chemicals might interact with the animals’ alien physiology.
- Nets and catch poles – If the Travellers are stealthy and can get close enough to their prey, they can catch them with either of these tools. See [[#EQUIPMENT]]
- Snares and traps can be set up to catch them but [[#Shakuurzarpi]] are quite clever. They can often defeat traps, stealing bait without becoming ensnared or injured. To set up a snare or trap, have a Traveller make a [[FTSkills#Recon]] (Survival) check vs +4 (takes 3D minutes) and record the Effect, positive or negative.  The number of shifts is the modifier to the creature's roll to defeat. [[#Shakuurzarpi]] have the Clever trait, as described on page 87 of the Traveller Companion ; for each snare or trap, have the animal make a Recon check to see if they can defeat it.

### TELEMPATHY
It is not generally known that [[#Shakuurzarpi]] have a psionic talent. [[SuSAG]] biologists have witnessed the animals’ behaviors in the wild and are conducting experiments to determine if the animal secretes pheromones to achieve these effects. They have yet to hypothesize the use of psionics. IISS researchers are closer to discovering the psionic link but have yet to publish their findings.
