Zircon 0310 C791668–9 M I NI G Zircon was originally colonized in 1006 by settlers from Arden, hoping to expand their sphere of influence. The population quickly grew to just over one million people and Zircon enjoyed good trade relationships with neighboring systems.

In 1083, during the Fourth Frontier War, House Mallor established a military base on Zircon and imposed Imperial rule. The base was constructed to provide supplies and facilities for Imperial forces travelling through Jewell from neighboring subsectors. With the presence of the Imperium, many of the original colonists relocated back to Arden but those who remained reluctantly accepted Imperial rule.

Since the war, House Mallor has amassed their own private army, which operates out of the military base to protect their interests and that of the Imperium. The last 10 years has seen a steady rise in the population, which now numbers over two million.

More recently, the Federation of Arden has begun to invest in mining facilities here to raise their influence on this world, which is now becoming a threat to House Mallor’s control of Zircon. This has led to House Mallor banning the trading of all technology in an effort to curtail the Federation’s expansion on Zircon.

This division has resulted in most imperialists gravitating towards the major cities, whilst others have settled in smaller towns where Count Mallor’s presence is not so strong.
