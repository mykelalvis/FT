# [[Fated Travels]] Skills

Differences exist between this and [[CTSkills|Classic Traveller Skills List]]

See [[Default Fate Core Skill List]]
Here is a basic list of example skills for you to use in your Fate games along with example stunts tied to each. They're the ones being used for all the examples in this book, and should give you a good foundation from which to tweak your own lists, adding and subtracting skills as best fits your setting. For more on creating your own skills, see the [[Extras]]section.

There are guidelines for [[What To Do During Play|edge cases]].

Items marked with `**` require permission (usually through [[Aspects (FST)]])
Items marked with `##` are [[#Classified skills]].  Some classifications also require permission.
Items marked with `@@` are [[#Cross Skilled]]

- [[Academics]] is generally replaced by [[#Profession]]
- [[Resources]] has been removed.  It is somewhat replaced by [[Gear#The Credits Track]].
- [[Drive]] was split into [[#Drive|planetary vehicles]] and being a spacecraft [[Pilot]]
- There are two [[extras]] : [[Gear]] and [[Social Standing]]  Both have some form of stress track.
- The Classic Traveller [[CTSkills#Streetwise]] is covered by other skills, such as [[#Larceny]],  [[Contacts]], [[Deceive]], possibly [[#Recon]], etc
- Both [[CTSkills#Survival]] and [[CTSkills#Tactics]] is covered by [[#Recon]].  Stunts can further expound on the character's training.
- [[Crafts]] is replaced by [[#Engineering]], which includes [[#Mechanic]]
- [[Lore]] is replaced with [[Psionics]], although actual psionic abilities are themselves stunts requiring permission.
- [[Stealth]] is subsumed by [[#Recon]]
- There is no [[CTSkills#Jack of All Trades]], although some combination of stunts might be able to replicate the effect.

## Classified skills

Classified skills are those which fall into a broad category.

- For each type, the character must choose a single "base field" for their skill.  That classification operates at the base skill level.
- Each subsequent choice operates at a -2 unless a _further_ stunt is applied to it (at the cost of 1 refresh).

## Cross Skilled

Some skills allow their use as "cross-skilled".  This means that they can operate within another specialty in their general field at a penalty.  In most other cases,  you are _unable to perform the task and will [generally] automatically fail_.

For instance, if your specialty is [[CTSkills#Life Sciences|Life Science (Xenobiology)]], then you can do other, unselected "Life Sciences" skills at -4.
