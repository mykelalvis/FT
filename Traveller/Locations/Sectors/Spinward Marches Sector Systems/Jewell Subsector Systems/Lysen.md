Lysen 0507 B592655–A S I NI G Although Lysen is the furthest system from the Jewell Cluster, its location along the communication route makes it the trade and economical hub between the Jewell and the Regina subsectors.

The first colonists came to Lysen in 503 but conditions made it difficult to survive. Trade routes were still being established in the subsector making growth very slow, especially considering that Lysen had very few exports.

There was little in the way of government or rulership, until several low ranking nobles adopted a feudal system. The planet was divided into regions, each ruled by one of the nobles and each specialising in a particular area such as farming or mining. Each region has one or two pressure domes where most people live, with smaller structures built near the farming areas.

With a new structured leadership directly related to their industry and economy, Lysen began to flourish. The specialized nature of their industry resulted in increased productivity, with the excess being available to trade with neighboring regions, merchants and offworlders.
