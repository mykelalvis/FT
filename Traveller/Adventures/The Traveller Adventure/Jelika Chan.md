# Jelika Chan

Jelika Chan (this name is merely the temporary alias by which the adventurers will know her) is [[Ashkashkur]]'s senior field agent in the [[Tukera#Vemene|Vemene]], and one of the very few who are in on his entire plot. Chan considers espionage a game: she is thrilled by danger and proud of her talents; she enjoys proving her superiority to others by deceiving them, the more complex the deception the better.
