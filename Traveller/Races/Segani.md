### Segani

The Segani are a more or less humanoid people, with leathery, faintly iridescent skin that hangs in folds around the head and neck in a manner reminiscent of a hood or scarf. Segani are tall by human standards, with few individuals failing to reach two meters in height.  They have long bones and greater skin surface area than a typical human, helping them shed heat whilst their head-skin folds protect from direct sunlight. It is not clear whether they are an engineered species or if they evolved naturally but they are known not to be native to their 'homeworld' of Segan.

#### Creating Segani Travellers
Segani are not very suitable as Travellers, as roleplaying may well require a slow descent into madness or desperate attempt to cling to sanity every time their ship jumps. However, Segani might be encountered in full (or more or less full) control of their faculties.

Characteristics Segani Travellers roll 2D for all characteristics except END. This is rolled on 1D+2 giving a maximum starting value of 8. No Segani can increase their END above 10 by any means.

Traits Segani Travellers all possess the following traits:
Desert Adaptation: Segani receive DM+2 on all Survival or Recon checks when in an arid environment.

Quick to Anger: A Segani can go from passive to all-out attack in seconds, lunging at an opponent before either of them knows the Segani is about to do it. Segani gain DM+2 to initiative rolls.

Careers The following careers from the Traveller Core Rulebook are all suitable for the Segani: Army, Citizen, Entertainer, Rogue, Scholar.

The Segani are an aggressive people, adept at quick movement in the desert and striking by surprise.
Physically fragile, their methods of warfare emphasise dispatching opponents quickly â€“ whether by a sudden strike with a knife, a sniper's bullet or rapid assault by grav cavalry. Their history is one of near-constant conflict, although of limited nature.

Segani technology peaked at TL10 around -400 and they had settlements on other bodies in their solar system when the [[Imperium]] arrived. However, they did not make use of the jump drive, as being in jumpspace can drive them insane. Those few who travel beyond their home system normally make use of low berths but even this can be risky to their mental health. A number of ports in the region have a handful of crazed old Segani wandering their alleyways or being treated in mental institutions, however no cure has been found for the instability caused by jump travel.
