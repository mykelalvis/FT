Mirror is a highly unsettled world with a great deal of hydrogen sulphide in its oceans, deposited there by its many active volcanos. The world is so named because of the reflective properties of its oceans. This visual oddity may have increased speculation of an Ancients presence, even if it is merely a chemical phenomenon. In fact, the Geonee are mostly interested in this world because it reminds them of Shiwonee, their highly unstable homeworld. Shiwonee is troubled by extensive climate change, which precipitates the nomadic movement of the Geonee people.
