# B'Andror

“You are approaching B'Andror. Welcome to Belfast Station.” -Belfast Highport, approximately two-hundred thirty nautical miles above the surface of B'Andror

When you first arrive to B'Andror you come to a well appointed [[Highport]], named [[#Belfast]]. Both Navy and Scout Services have a presence there and signage indicates the existence of a TAS office. You can drink and revel in the knowledge that the Highport of B'Andror is well maintained. Checking around you're likely to hear reports of pirate activity around a nearby system and discussion of the political dynamic on the planet; as well as the possible existence of Ancient technology hidden somewhere under the surface. While not necessarily friendly, people on Belfast are also not as xenophobic as the inhabitants of B'Andror.

For anyone trading: there isn't much as this world is considered Non-Agricultural but otherwise abhorrently average; there are common goods available but not much else; B'Andror imports a lot, especially combat equipment due to constant conflicts on the planet.
One thing you might notice is the abundance of Vacc Suits available; this is because the surface of the planet is barely hospitable unless you're in one of the domed cities, you wouldn't survive long without specialized equipment to help you move and breathe.
The planet of B'Andror is a much different place than the Highport the Travellers will likely encounter first.

B'Andror is not a crowded place but it still has a well established population; especially considering that their population of 6,720,000 inhabitants are confined to a few city-states that are designed to provide a survivable atmosphere for half that number. In fact, the living conditions are so bad that there is nearly constant strife between the active government and various rebellions that want control of the planet's limited resources. That means that hidden weapons and armor are strictly forbidden, but visible weapons and armor are still allowed and often overlooked by whichever group is currently in charge.

The current president of B'Andror is [[Josephine Hill]], a tall woman with very angular features and thin frame. She is arrogant and prides herself on her diplomatic prowess which she states, though it isn't true, as the reason she is currently the highest government official. In truth she killed anyone that stood in her way, giving her the nickname Ruthless Josephine Hill. The rebel group, which had been the leading government only a few decades earlier, is known as Red Sun but their leader is unknown. Due to the nearly constant political strife and open hostilities, B'Andror is considered an Amber level planet, travel to this planet is allowed but caution should be exercised.

The people of B'Andror, who call themselves Androids, could be branded as highly Xenophobic. They are wary of outsiders, who are easily identifiable by their proclivity of wearing Vaccsuits and other equipment used by people that have not acclimated to the environment of B'Andror; it could be difficult for Travellers to learn much from the residents that actively avoid being near them.

There is a decent amount of technology available on B'Andror, and even more for anyone with enough credits to burn. With a known Tech Level of ten, B'Andror has most technology available, though it could be more expensive and harder to find technology that is of a higher technological level; with all that is available you have to ask yourself if what you can buy is worth the extra credits. In
the end, B'Andror is not a place willingly visited by tourists; though Travellers will be keen to stop at Belfast for fuel and maintenance to their ship. As the largest planet in the immediate area and with a mostly unexplored alien planet, the opportunity for adventure is not difficult to come by.
