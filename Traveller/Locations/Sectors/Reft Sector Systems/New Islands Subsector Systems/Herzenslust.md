Herzenslust is a habitable world, with a dense, tainted atmosphere and sufficient water to support a vibrant ecosphere. Surface gravity is high enough to be uncomfortable for newcomers but tolerable in the long term. After existing for many years at subsistence level, Herzenslust received an influx of colonists from New Colchis and, not surprisingly, became a colonial possession of that world.

The economic and industrial heart of Herzenslust is its capital city, which enjoys greater technological and social sophistication than the rest of the world. The capital has its own Class C starport but this is off-limits to all vessels other than those coming from New Colchis. Everyone else must make do with a rudimentary port over a hundred kilometres away.

Technology is a sustainable TL6, though the capital has a lot of imported equipment in use and is to some extent a city of New Colchis that happens to be located on Herzenslust. This sharp social divide causes surprisingly little friction as the general population is self-sufficient and for the most part just wants to get on with daily life.
## HERZENSLUST STARPORT

Herzenslust starport is little more than a large open space where the occasional ship lands, used by small traders for the most part; a far trader or subsidised merchant working the Central Islands Cluster is by no means an unusual sight. More than one or two ships in port at any one time is uncommon however, and large vessels more so; virtually all major traffic through Herzenslust is from New Colchis and uses the main port.
