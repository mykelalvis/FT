# ARDEN

Arden is a moderate sized world with a thin atmosphere and rather scanty coverage of surface water. Although not optimal, this was sufficient to make Arden a strong candidate for colonization. Consequently, large numbers of settlers arrived in the early years of Imperial expansion into [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]].

Arden prospered but did not thrive. The population gradually increased to the modern level of some 1.03 billion but the world never quite became an economic or industrial powerhouse. Nevertheless, a solid TL9 economy emerged, finding markets for its goods among lower-tech worlds nearby.

Along the way, Arden's governmental structure ossified.  Although officially government personnel are elected, in practice they can only be elected from among the ranks of the Arden Society, a select group whose members earn their place through financial contributions or service to the ideals of the society.

The Arden Society is dedicated to making Arden a major player on the interstellar stage and works steadily towards that goal. It controls the government of Arden and a number of industrial or economic bodies, and in recent years has begun to spread its net beyond Arden itself.

The society has openly imperialist aspirations and is working to create a [[Federation of Arden]] from businesses and shipping lines. In time, this Federation will, its members hope, include the governments of nearby worlds. Although the project is in its infancy, already the Federation has major business assets on close worlds and is in a position to influence the making of policy.

[[Federation of Arden|The Federation]] is particularly influential on [[Caloran]] and on [[Zircon]] and [[Utoland]] in the [[Jewell subsector]].

On [[Caloran]], a steady takeover of agricultural-related businesses is underway but, rather than targeting the farms and landowners themselves, the Federation is insinuating itself into the food-processing industry
(such as it is) and edging out local operators with machinery and techniques from Arden. The farmers can continue to raise crops as before but what passes through the port for export is increasingly under the control of the Federation.

Both [[Zircon]] and [[Utoland]] are rated as 'non-industrial' by the [[Imperial Interstellar Scout Service]] but [[Arden]]-backed industrial concerns, operated by personnel brought in for the purpose, are operating on both worlds. The aim is to corner the market in industrial production and make the planetary economies dependent on Arden-owned factories. Thus far, the strategy seems to be paying off.

Agents of the [[Federation of Arden]] are active on other worlds too, seeking opportunities for strategic investment that can later be converted into political influence. In short, Arden is building a political alliance by creating economic dependency.

On Arden itself, extremely strict laws and bureaucratic procedures are in place. Enforcement is efficient and vigorous, not least because the Arden Society uses laws its officials pass to keep prospective rivals from making any credible challenge. Meanwhile, the world is undergoing steady industrial growth, accompanied by investment in an expanded technological base.

Arden is especially interested in starship technology.The Starport is Class B. It can't build starships. Although government yards nearby can maintain, repair and service them using imported parts. Several Arden-based businesses own and operate starships, and the government has acquired a respectable system squadron as well as a handful of small jump-capable warships.  Expanding either the military or commercial fleets much further will require an indigenous shipbuilding capability, which is at present beyond the investment capability of Arden. However, the fledgling Federation is strategically located in neutral space between the [[Imperium]] and  [[Zhodani Consulate|Consulate]], and it is possible that the Federation may play one off against the other to obtain investment or assistance in necessary industries.

Arden (and its Federation) is neither hostile nor friendly towards the [[Imperium]]. The same rules are imposed on Imperial ships as on independents passing through.  These include import tariffs and other practices not permitted within the [[Imperium]] and are not levied against businesses friendly to Arden. A number of free trader captains have come to an agreement with Arden, trading nominal membership in [[Federation of Arden|the Federation]] for the waiving of tariffs. This ability to conduct preferential trade makes membership attractive to ships plying the local spacelanes, although it is not clear what the price tag will eventually be.
