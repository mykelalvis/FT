# THE FRONTIER WARS

The settlement of the Spinward Marches proceeded inexorably, with a gradual establishment of Imperial boundaries further and further spinward. By 500, the newly settled areas were adjacent to territories being settled by the Zhodani Consulate in the Cronor subsector. By 550, the two empires had intermingled their settlements, in some cases sharing systems, in others holding neighboring worlds. The differences between the lmperium and the Zhodani heightened tensions, bringing the two sides into conflict and, eventually, open warfare.
