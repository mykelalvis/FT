# TEE-TEE-TEE

The origins of Tee-Tee-Tee's strange name are lost in the mists of time, although it is thought to be a corruption of an old astrographical designation. The locals typically call their world Threet (a contraction of 'Three-Ts'), which permits endless variations on the theme of 'Threet Fleet' when referring to the world's trade fleet. Tee-Tee-Tee is ruled by a consortium of hereditary trader princes, who make their money offworld on the spacelanes; the planet itself is just a base of operations and has little industry of its own. The Threet Fleet can be encountered all over the sector and beyond, with some merchant cruisers staying out for years at a time.

Tee-Tee-Tee is otherwise a typical rockball planet with the merest trace of atmospheric gas. Its 900,000 or so inhabitants are mostly employed in the households of the merchant princes – Tee-Tee-Tee is said to have more accountants per square kilometer of its surface than almost any other world this side of [[Core sector]]  – or in supporting industries at the small but efficient starport. The world has a spectacular ring system thought to be the result of a collision between moons in the distant past. The spectacle is noted as one of the 'wonders of [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]]' and frequently visited by tourist ships. The downport makes a steady profit from catering to these vessels, although tourism is only as small sideline compared to the real business of interstellar commerce.
