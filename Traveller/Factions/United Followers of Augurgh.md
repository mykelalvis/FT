### The United Followers of Augurgh (UFA)

Despite its name, the UFA is not all that united, nor are its members all followers of the overall leader.  It is a rather loose alliance of world governments and other organizations, some of them unofficial in nature. The UFA was founded on the world of Augurgh in the Aegaek subsector around 1090, although accounts vary as to exactly when it became a political movement to be taken seriously. It was initially a pro-Augurgh movement intended to increase control over neighboring worlds in Provence sector but grew beyond the expectations of its founders.

Augurgh's emissaries managed to gain the loyalty of various political factions, corsair bands and trading alliances, although some joined the movement more due to favors owed than allegiance to Augurgh. With this large but thinly-spread powerbase, Augurgh was able to apply pressure to other world governments in the Million and Aegeak subsectors.

The UFA today claims the loyalty of a chain of worlds stretching all the way to the Imperial border and has significant influence over some Imperial worlds in the Million subsector. Loyalty is claimed rather than concrete, with member worlds breaking away at times or groups withdrawing their allegiance. This sometimes leads to internal conflict or policy decisions made more with the aim of placating disaffected supporters than with the best interests of its members.

The UFA maintains the trappings of a legitimate and stable interstellar state, modelling many of its institutions on those of the [[Imperium]]. It has a formally organised navy, although this is composed mainly of donated vessels and subject to mutinies as a faction decides to leave the UFA and withdraws its forces.
The UFA is also quite happy to use piracy, raiding and organised crime to influence governments and increase support. In this, it at times can seem more like a protection racket than a multiworld government.

It is possible to deal with the UFA as a normal interstellar state and agreements are upheld unless internal politics requires a different approach. However, the UFA is a dangerous neighbor to have â€“ stable enough to take concerted action but prone to rapid changes in policy or deliberate flouting of its rules by rebellious members.
