Vast Heavens receives literally no attention from the [[Duke of Zeng]]. Containing just two worlds, one of which is a client state and the other completely independent, it lies beyond the area of interest of the local nobility other than when events at [[Capital]] require a noble to take notice of events out in the [[Great Rift]]. This is a very rare occurrence.
