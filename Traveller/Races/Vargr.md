# Vargr in the Marches

Vargr are the second most common species in the [[Imperium]], especially at the coreward end of Imperial space. Most worlds in [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]] have a mixed human/Vargr population, although humans are prevalent.  On a few worlds, the minority Vargr are second-class citizens or live in separate communities but, for the most part, humans and Vargr live in the same streets and apartment blocks, work alongside and are entirely familiar with one another.

Imperial Vargr are just that; Imperial citizens like anyone else, and seen as a-person-from-[[Regina]], for example, rather than an alien. They tend to display Imperial cultural influences or follow the culture of their homeworld, just like anyone else.

Non-Imperial Vargr, from the Extents, come from different cultures, one of many that exist in the region.  They have different habits and values to Imperial Vargr, depending on their origins. There are no large Vargr states in [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]] and no monolithic power structure in the Extents. Local politics are vigorous at times and governments can change on a short time frame, making cross-border politics somewhat interesting.

Vargr of all origins show their pack-animal roots in a tendency to gravitate to individuals or ideas with charisma. Charisma is hard to define in this context; each individual Vargr has his own idea of what constitutes a worthy cause or leader. Status and recognition tend to be more important to Vargr than in humans, especially if it comes from someone the Vargr admires or respects.

Contrary to stereotypes, Vargr are not flighty in their allegiances. They may transfer loyalty from one leader to another if he has sufficient charisma, however this is not done lightly. It is usually considered a natural consequence of meeting a more charismatic leader, rather than betrayal if a Vargr leaves his old allegiance.  However, this does not mean a Vargr naval officer will switch sides at the drop of a hat. Charisma is a factor but there are many others to be considered; demonstrating loyalty to a leader is a charismatic act in its own right.

Vargr trade boats from the Extents can be encountered all over [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]], especially in the coreward-trailing corner of the sector. Unfortunately, so can corsairs.  Raiding is considered a more honorable profession by Vargr than humans and some states of the Extents actively encourage it, though most Imperial Vargr are less accepting of raiding and piracy.
