## SOHO-CLASS LIGHT FREIGHTER

The Soho-class light freighter is a variant on the millennia-old Empress Marava-class far trader. First introduced more than a century ago by General Development Company, the vessel blurs the line between civilian and military. The designers envisioned a vessel capable of operating in the frontier regions of the spinward side of the Great Rift – where there may be no convenient naval vessel if someone has ill-intentions. The class has really shown its value in the Trojan Reach due to the endemic piracy issues there.

To achieve their goal, the GeDeCo architects had to make sacrifices. The first to go were the convenient side cargo airlocks, although the loading belt did remain. Now all cargo had to be loaded/unloaded through the front cargo hatch, exposing the hold to the elements. The other major systems to be removed were the staterooms and low berths used to carry passengers. This class was intended to haul cargo, not be a people mover. However, provisions were made in the power system to provide the capability for portable staterooms to be installed in the cargo hold.

The removal of these items allowed for the addition of multiple upgrades that greatly enhanced the survivability of the vessel. The interior hull of the ship was reinforced, providing approximately 10 percent more structural integrity. The output of the maneuver drive was doubled, allowing for faster translations between safe jump points and planetary orbits. This served not only to speed delivery of cargo but decrease the amount of time a hostile has to intercept the vessel. Finally, the ship was wrapped in seven and a half centimeters of crystaliron armor to shield occupants, cargo and vital systems.

Defensive modifications were not the only upgrades slated for this variant. The weak double beam laser turrets were removed, the first being replaced by a triple pulse laser turret that took advantage of technological upgrades made since the weapon's introduction. Enhanced focusing crystals allowed for an effective range of almost 50,000 kilometers while improved capacitors provided a more consistent output. The second turret's replacement consists of a heavy pulse laser barbette that takes advantage of the same technological improvements.

To support both of these enhanced weapon systems, other modifications were made. The sensor suite was upgraded to military specification with enhanced detection and tracking arrays. A more powerful computer, capable of running auto-evasion and fire control software, replaced the basic system of the Empress Marava-class. Automatic repair software was also added, along with the requisite drones, to speed recovery in the event of damage.

Foremost among new customers were shipping and mercenary concerns looking to use the vessels as Q-ships. As these original vessels aged, they were much sought after on the secondary market by small merchants looking for proved ruggedness and inherent safety. By 1100 Imperial, there were thousands of these vessels plying the spacelanes.

> Popular with military craft in the early stellar Tech Levels, laser barbettes provide a heavier hitting energy weapon than the turrets they are derived from. By the mid-stellar Tech Levels, these weapons are superseded by more powerful particle and fusion-based barbettes. Civilian craft, however, still find use for laser-based barbette weaponry.

> Using technology identical to their turret-based brethren, pulse and beam laser barbettes retain the advantages and disadvantages inherent in their smaller versions. However, they cannot be used for point defense fire, as with any other barbette.
