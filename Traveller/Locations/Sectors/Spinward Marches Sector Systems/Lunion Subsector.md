With most of its worlds on the [[Spinward Main]] and in close proximity to [[Mora Subsector|Mora]], the Lunion subsector was settled early in the Imperial expansion into [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]] and contains a number of high-technology worlds.  Most traffic bound for the [[Five Sisters Subsector|Five Sisters]] and [[Darrian Subsector|Darrian]] goes through Lunion, contributing to the local economy.

[[Ling Standard Products]] (LSP) has major shipyards at [[Lunion]] and [[Strouden]], the most important yards in [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]] in terms of output. They handle commercial and military contracts on a large scale, as well as building standard designs and one-off vessels for private customers. Standards of workmanship are very high. Not coincidentally, the main naval bases for the subsector are also at [[Lunion]] and [[Strouden]], with light patrol forces based out of [[Shirene]] and [[Capon]]. Subsector assets belong to the 43<sup>rd</sup> Fleet, which is mainly concerned with keeping its section of the [[Spinward Main]] safe for navigation. Long-term guardship deployments are not uncommon, even in systems with minor starports. While tedious for the crews involved, such deployments go a long way towards deterring both piracy and smuggling.

The sparse area in the coreward end of the subsector is part of the [[Abyss Rift]] and has the same bad reputation for misjumping ships and other strange phenomena.

The subsector's planetoid belts are something of an economic disappointment. [[Gandr]] is particularly poor, although the discovery of superheavy elements there in [[IY1040]] caused a number of firms to move in, only to pull out again when the deposits proved unviable. [[Zaibon]] once had the largest deposit of copper on record but this has been played out and few new deposits are being found. As a result, the system's mining-based economy is in decline.

[[Ianic]] has a sizable minority of [[Jonkeereen]] (about 30%) among its population, humans genetically engineered to thrive in desert environments. They generally live apart from the world's other humans but get along well enough with them.

Less harmonious is [[Quiru]], where a recent coup using mercenary forces toppled the government and put a military junta in its place. As yet there has been no official Imperial response.
