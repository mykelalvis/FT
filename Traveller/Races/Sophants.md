**SOPHONT**: A generalized term for an intelligent lifeform and technology-using being Native Intelligent Life (NIL) or Sapient, including humans as well as intelligent aliens.

*   The number of sophonts which have been contacted is quite high; the Imperium boasts more than a hundred; Charted Space boasts more than four hundred.
*   Tools are used to adapt, change, or control an environment. Tool-using cultures are groups of beings (not necessarily sophonts) with the ability to find or make tools.
*   But, using tools is not enough: Technology is the ability to use tools as force multipliers to get things done.
*   Technology builds on the successes of earlier tool-making experiences, and enables a progression to higher levels.

# Description (Specifications)

A **Sophont** is a member of a species (race) generally recognized as sapient that has achieved a presence on an interstellar scale.

*   **Sophonts** are consistently described with a long name in the format “the \[race name\] of \[homeworld\]”. For example, the [[Llellewyoly]] of [[Junidy]] .

### Alternate Terminology

A number of other terms exist amongst the many sophont species of Charted Space for technology-using beings including:

*   Higher Ensouled Being
*   Highly Intelligent Being
*   HILF (higher intelligent life form)
*   Mesosophont
*   Sapient
*   Sentient
*   True Artificial Intelligence

### Cycle of Life & Sophontic Civilization

*   A-life → Proto-Life → Creatures → Proto-Sophonts → Sophonts → Transcendents → Ascendants → Singularity

Stages:

1.  A-life
2.  Proto-Life (transitory stage)
3.  Creatures
4.  Proto-Sophonts (transitory stage)
5.  Sophonts
6.  Transcendents (transitory stage)
7.  Ascendants
8.  Singularity

# History & Background (Dossier)

**Remarks:** Any intelligent species. Sophont is preferred to Sapient, although the two terms are roughly synonymous. The IISS assumes a vague hierarchy in which sapient is inferior to sophont (roughly, sapients as a species have not left their homeworld, and sophonts are present in interstellar society).

*   Sentient technically means “feeling” and should not be used to describe an intelligent species.
*   Sophont encompasses all intelligent species.
*   The study of sophonts or intelligent life forms is sophontology; some older IISS materials used xenology, or even xenoanthropology, but sophontology is preferred.
