James Forbes is an Imperial agent whose mandate is to investigate any potential threat from the Zhodani Consulate. Forbes' investigations took him to Farreach where he surpassed his predecessors. He found out about the secret laboratory and confirmed that the Zhodani are working on a super weapon, codenamed 'Tripwire'.

Forbes has not seen the ancient device but he knows enough to report back to his superiors. Concerned that his ship is being observed by [[Zhodani]] agents, Forbes must secure passage on a ship to take him to Esalin where he can report his findings. He has also heard rumors that the separatists, under direction from [[Zhodani]] agents, are planning some sort of terrorist attack to destabilize the Jewell subsector. Both of these threats are related in some way but he is not sure how.

Forbes is a serious man, dedicated to his career and the [[Imperium]]. He is not known for his conversation and when he does speak, he gets straight to point. He has no distinguishing features and blends well in a crowd.

Like many Imperial agents, Forces spends most of his time in the field and is usually under cover. For this reason he rarely makes direct contact with his superiors but leaves encrypted messages with trusted contacts who pass them on to Imperial couriers.
