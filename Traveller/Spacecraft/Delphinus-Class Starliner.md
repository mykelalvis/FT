## DELPHINUS-CLASS STARLINER

High Passage on a typical liner usually comes with a promise of luxury and adventure but Travellers are often disappointed with the cramped accommodations, mediocre food, indifferent hospitality staff and smug fellow passengers. Shipbuilding firm General Products LIC has created a new offering for the jet set that promises a much more enjoyable and luxurious interstellar travel experience.

The Delphinus-class pleasure yacht conveys Travellers to their desired location with opulence and efficiency. Its aerofins ensure a smooth transition from close orbit to atmosphere and enable the flight crew to engage in exciting aerobatics should passengers desire a thrill. Framed by a lush biosphere, the central recreation area contains a full galley and holographic gaming space for virtual sports and immersive entertainment experiences. The ship's Intellect software is programmed to respond to the passengers' every need and works in concert with a steward to ensure a pleasant transit between the stars.

Perhaps the most unusual feature of the Delphinus is its integral aquatic drive. Employing cutting-edge military spacecraft technology but with civilian passengers in mind, the ship is reinforced for underwater operations including a top speed of 10 knots and an operating depth of 150 meters. Passengers need not be concerned about the fragility of the ship's light frame. Crystaliron struts and advanced polymer viewports reinforce the hull's integrity during underwater operations, ensuring a safe and enjoyable submarine voyage. The ship is also designed to cruise on the water's surface. When floating, retractable platforms can be extended from beneath the hull so passengers can step outside, enjoy the sunset of a binary pair or fish the seas of an alien world.

Critics have cited the ship's light hull, energy-inefficient thrusters, late jump drive and tight bridge accommodations as unnecessary design sacrifices. General Products has adamantly denied cutting corners on this spacecraft, pointing out that each feature of the ship is designed with the customer in mind. The light hull accommodates larger viewports and enhances the ship's in-atmosphere performance, the thrusters give passengers a thrill with their loud and boisterous roar, and late jumps give passengers the time to make a few goodbye calls, get settled, wind down and enjoy the view enroute to a 150-diameter limit whilst having a light meal and cocktails. The compact bridge design provides more space for the rec room and clearly establishes the ship's identity as a luxury conveyance, refusing to waste copious amounts of space for technical components.

The Delphinus offers the features and luxury of a yacht and the performance of a courier at an affordable price.

> [!info] Underwater Operations Kit (TL7)
> Most starships have the ability to float on liquid water and a limited ability to dive beneath its surface to a depth of around 50 meters. The underwater operations kit includes add-ons and a drive that enable a spacecraft to dive to depths of up to 150 meters and travel underwater at a speed of up to 10 knots. There are two prerequisites; the hull configuration must be streamlined or standard and the ship must have fuel scoops. The aquatic drive adds a pump and exhaust system to the scoops that facilitates submarine travel. The kit also enables the ship to travel on the water's surface but at only half the speed.
>
> The underwater operations kit costs MCr0.02 per ton of hull and consumes 1% of the ship's available tonnage. A more comprehensive underwater operations kit is available at TL8 that costs MCr0.05 per ton of hull and requires 2.5% of the available space. The TL8 kit enables the ship to travel to a depth of 1,000 meters and travel at up to 20 knots. Both kits consume a negligible amount of power but require an operational power source.
