### Hortalez

Hortalez  et Cie specialises in finance and banking rather than physical goods and has brokerages in most major starports. It is not clear if Hortalez is a player in the political arena or not, due to complex chains of transactions that disguise many of its major dealings.

However, it is obvious that Hortalez et Cie is keen to support any faction that keeps trade lanes open and money flowing. To that end, the megacorporation is thought to be a stabilizing influence, exerting steady pressure for moderation on all factions. Its mediators have assisted in the negotiation of several important peace treaties, favoring fair deals that reduce chance of further conflict.

Dating from the early 200s, [[Hortalez]] et Cie is a financial corporation which owns numerous businesses (including shares in other Megacorporations) but does not operate them under its own corporate identity. Its activities under its own name are almost exclusively limited to the financial sector.

Among other activities, Hortalez et Cie finances colonial operations, building projects and economic investments. It also deals in insurance and mercenary bonding as well as (in some regions) serving as a recruitment house for mercenaries, starship crews and similar personnel.

Hortalez bankrolls a lot of Imperial and local projects. In a frontier region like the Spinward Marches, Hortalez tends to be involved in funding starport development and economic expansion on developing worlds or recent colonies. In recent years it has shown an increasing reluctance to fund speculative trade expeditions beyond the Imperial frontier, though there have been a number of exceptions to this rule.
