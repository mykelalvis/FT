From [[Tripwire]]
Grant Grant 0807 X664100–0 0807 X664100–0 I Lo NI GI Lo NI G The Imperium has designated Grant a red zone world and a small naval fleet prevents any unauthorized access to the planet. Rumors as to why it is a red zone world range from protecting a developing civilization to secret military installations. Full details can be found on page 71 (Tripwire).

The Grant system has eight planets and the planet Grant occupies the sixth orbit. The outer two planets are both gas giants.

Grant 0807 X664100–0 I Lo NI G Although Grant has little in the way of minerals the planetary conditions made it a viable world for colonization but with valuable resources being found elsewhere Grant was left untouched for a long time.

When a small group of colonists eventually explored the planet they found the Tripwire device. The [[Imperium]] were swift to respond and within months a research facility was being built. The [[Imperium]] also designated Grant a red zone world and a small naval fleet was deployed to prevent any unauthorized access to the planet.

Grant has a population of around 30 people. Ten of these are scientists, 10 are security guards and the rest attend to the day to day running of the facility. Apart from those involved with the project, nobody knows why Grant is a Red world. This has led to a number of rumors, ranging from protecting a developing civilization to a secret military installation.

# ATTITUDES

The naval officers of the fleet patrolling Grant are suspicious of all vessels entering the system. Any ship that comes within range will be hailed and asked what their business is here. Most travellers simply stop here to refuel at the gas giants but whatever the reason, the Imperial officers will make it clear that ships are not welcome here and it is best to be on their way as soon as possible.

# LAWS

Legal restrictions do not apply since access to Grant is denied.

# PLACES OF INTEREST

## Research Facility

This is the only man-made feature on Grant.  In addition to providing laboratories, the facility has a habitat area for the people who live and work here.

## GRANT

Grant is habitable but is interdicted (and therefore a Red Zone) by the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service for undisclosed reasons. It is commonly believed that the IISS interdicts worlds to protect inhabitants or prevent visitors from coming to harm, while the Navy does so for strategic or political reasons. If this is true, Grant may have an indigenous species species that needs to be protected, although there are the usual wild claims of ancient alien ruins and hidden research bases. One persistent rumor is that the Imperium is quietly building a city on Grant, perhaps as a retreat for high-value personnel or as a large-scale social experiment.
No proof has emerged but the regular presence of Navy ships enforcing the blockade makes many observers wonder if something is happening on Grant beyond the usual Scout Service interdict-to-protect rationale.
