# The Fourth Frontier War

The Fourth Frontier War (1082 to 1084) is sometimes called the False War. The war began unintentionally. as a result of an incident near Quare/Cronor, where the lmperium maintains a naval base just beyond the Zhodani border. This triggered a series of naval battles throughout the Jewell and Cronor subsectors. An armistice was concluded after eighteen months of fighting, before the capital had a chance to issue instructions or send reinforcements. The lmperium lost another world (Narval/Cronor). and was forced to accept joint tenancy of Esalinuewell with the Zhodani, but it regained two worlds lost to the Sword Worlds a century before.

Today, forces patrol the border on both sides and tension is high. even though the wars have always been confined to the spinward subsectors of the Marches, and their battles have rarely spilled over into the older subsectors. The apprehension of war grows less intense and less important as one moves away from the border.
