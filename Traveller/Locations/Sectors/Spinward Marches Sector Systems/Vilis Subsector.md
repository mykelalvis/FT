The Vilis subsector is located in the [[Spinward Marches]] of the [[Imperium]], very close to the frontier. It contains 26 worlds and a population of approximately 10 billion.

Vilis is a border region, with a little less than half of its worlds being Imperial members. The spinward border is more or less open, since space in that direction is pretty much neutral. Any threat from spinward-coreward is mitigated by the worlds of the Jewell Cluster (in the [[Jewell subsector]]) flanking any Zhodani advance through non-aligned systems in that direction.

However, there is a threat from rimward in the form of the [[Sword Worlds]], who have aligned with the Zhodani on several occasions, guiding strategic thinking to some extent. However, the distribution of star systems in Vilis subsector provides a 'firebreak' to trailing, ensuring any defeat in Vilis is likely to be a local one.

Preventing such a defeat is the responsibility of the 193<sup>rd</sup> Fleet, based out of [[Frenzie]], [[Denotam]] and [[Mirriam]]. Its most likely opponents are the [[Sword Worlds]], whose ships have lower jump capability than the Consulate.
Against less mobile fleets, a strategy of static defence is possible and the 193rd maintains a number of guardship deployments in the form of non-jump-capable monitors supported by tenders but unable to redeploy on their own.

Apart from a single BatRon held at [[Frenzie]] as a deterrent, Sector Fleet deployments in Vilis are mainly light units in destroyer and light cruiser classes. Such vessels are considered entirely adequate to deal with border incidents with the technologically inferior [[Sword Worlds]] and patrol the [[Abyss Rift]]. The [[Imperial Navy|Navy]] is also responsible for maintaining communications with the research station at [[Retinae]] and showing the Imperial Sunburst in the neutral ports of Querion.

The world designated [[728-907]] has been catalogued for a long time but was only recently properly surveyed. It possesses a viable ecosphere with vegetation and insect life but no higher animals have been detected and the world has been passed to [[Imperial Colonial Office]] (ICO) administration with a view to colonization in the next few decades. Some interest has been seen from megacorporations, notably [[Sternmetal Horizons]], but nothing concrete has yet emerged.

[[Asgard]] is [[Red Zone]]d and has been for many years. As usual the reason for this has not been released by the authorities but the presence of a low-tech culture suggests that the protection of the locals or visiting Imperials is likely to be the reason.

The worlds of the spinward-coreward corner of the subsector are gradually coming under sway of a loose alliance usually referred to as the [[Federation of Arden]].  As yet this is unofficial but a formal alliance seems to be emerging. Since [[Arden]] lies between [[Imperial]] and [[Zhodani]] holdings, these worlds are of strategic interest and an additional player entering the game is a cause for concern.
