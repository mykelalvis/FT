# Assault Rocket Launcher

The Assault Rocket Launcher, or ARL, is a variant on the concept of a chemical-propellant slugthrower. Introduced at TL10, the ARL is favored by some armed forces as an alternative to standard firearms, especially by those who operate in a low-gravity environment. Recoil is much lower than a standard weapon since the projectile accelerates under its own power and continues to do so after leaving the barrel. This comes at the price of reduced accuracy and lower effectiveness at very short ranges, yet for most users these disadvantages are offset by the weapon's versatility.

The assault rocket launcher fires 10mm solid-fuel rocket slugs, each with four pinhole-sized nozzles angled to induce spin, stabilizing the projectile in flight. By the time the projectile has travelled five meters its propellant will have burned out and maximum velocity will have been reached. This is less than that of a standard bullet but many ARL projectiles rely on payload delivery rather than sheer kinetic energy for effect. Most ammunition reaches a final velocity of around 800m/s, with gas rounds achieving only 300 m/s.

Ammunition is held in detachable magazines inserted into the underside of the weapon behind the pistol grip. Standard magazines hold 20 rounds, with larger 40-round versions available for the squad-support role. These make the weapon rather clumsy and are not favored by personnel who may have to move quickly. There is no ejection mechanism as the whole round is fired and the barrel is vented to allow exhaust gases to escape. This has the secondary effect of reducing the noise made by an ARL compared to a standard firearm.

The standard ARL is not capable of automatic fire. A more expensive support version is otherwise quite similar and magazines are interchangeable between the two. A personal defence weapon (PDW) variant also exists, which has an extremely short barrel and no stock. Although the final velocity of projectiles from this weapon is roughly the same as that of other versions, accuracy is even worse and generally considered a failed experiment. However, some users like having a wildly inaccurate but powerful weapon, citing the deterrent value of fully-automatic mayhem.

Standard ammunition is a squash-head round designed to deliver maximum impact to the target without over-penetration. Sometimes referred to as dum-dum rounds, squash-head ammunition is favored for shipboard operations against lightly armored opponents. For harder targets, kinetic-energy armor-piercing (KEAP) and high-explosive armor-piercing (HEAP) rounds are available.

All ARL weapons suffer DM-1 to attack rolls. The PDW variant instead suffers DM-2 to hit all attack rolls made against targets beyond 10m.
