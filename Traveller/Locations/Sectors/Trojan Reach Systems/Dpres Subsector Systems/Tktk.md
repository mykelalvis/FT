# TKTK

WORLD MAP AND LIBRARY DATA

An astute physicist might assume that predicting the flow of Tktk’s transient rivers could be done simply by consulting the appropriate charts and calculating the gravitational effects of the two stars and gas giant, factoring in their changing positions...if not for an additional variable: subterranean water flows. The rivers are fed by hundreds of natural aquifers and springs that ebb and flow to and from the surface depending on a complex array of factors including the aforementioned gravitational effects, seismic activity, and subterranean weather of the caverns. The aquifers have thus far been only partially mapped and therefore present a significant wild card when trying to forecast their movement.

There are six notable human cities on the planet (including the down starport), and all but one have taken steps to address the threat of floods from Tktk’s unpredictable rivers. The cities of Laurb, Purcoult, Capital, and Tktk Down Starport depend upon complex sewage systems and architectural adjustments that allow for frequent flooding. Buildings in these cities are designed with one of the following adaptations:

- They can endure partial or complete submergence in water.
- They are anchored to the planet’s surface and float like barges when the area is flooded.
- They are built on struts that enable the planet’s waterways to run beneath them when present.

During a dry spell, the cities look bizarre and alien, perhaps designed by some oddball architect. But after experiencing one of the planet’s river shifts and resulting flash floods, their eccentricity is justified.

The city of Nomad is actually a large mobile platform on tracks. Whenever a new river pathway threatens to flood the city, its engineers move it out of harm’s way.

Thistle, which has no such adaptations, is located in the northern hemisphere in a desert where historically water has never run. Thistle is popular among tourists due to its charming white adobe buildings and its proximity to three of the planet’s largest and most majestic grand spires.

Predicting the location, flow direction, and current strength of Tktk’s hydrosphere is a science unto itself. Tktk’s innocuously named Department of Planetology (DoP) is depended upon for accurate river flow forecasts, a daunting task that might elude them if not for the presence of a cadre of Thalassan advisors and the IISS.

Thalassans, renowned for their ability to predict the complex array of meteorological and tidal effects on their waterbound homeworld, apply their unique array of predictive disciplines to the much dryer, more arid climate of Tktk. The Scout Service has also established a constant, if unofficial, presence on the planet. Tktk grants the Scouts unfettered access to the non-aligned world in exchange for high-tech survey equipment that the Thalassan advisors use to predict the water flows.

The Scout Service’s primary motive for establishing a presence on Tktk is to study and protect the world’s two million alien sophonts, a unique chirper variant who call themselves tktks. Tktks are identical to other chirpers in most ways with a few notable differences. They are smaller and lankier, have darker skin (typically dark grey or light brown), and possess larger wings that give them enhanced lift. They also possess a respiratory system that enables them to breathe the thin and tainted atmosphere of Tktk without a filter or other apparatus.

Tktks lead a nomadic existence, living off the hardy grains and small fauna of the land. Their tribes establish habitations both above and below ground, with few limiting themselves to one or the other. After they exhaust the food supply in one spot, they pick up their modest possessions and move on to a new location.

As chirpers, tktks are not initiated in the Droyne coyn ceremony and caste system; however, some tktks do exhibit minor psionic abilities. Each tribe has a shaman among their ranks who has the ability to anticipate problems before they happen, such as the food supply running out or the coming of a flood. When this happens, the shamans inform their tribes that it is time to move on. IISS and resident researchers believe that the shamans possess a low-level precognitive ability.

The IISS is very concerned about the vulnerability of the tktk population, given that the world is located in the unstable and war-torn Dustbelt. Officials in the Scouts are hoping to establish Tktk as an Imperial Client State and then promptly interdict the planet, giving it red-zone status to protect its vulnerable indigenous population. The Imperium has shown an interest in doing so, but Tktk’s human population is proud of its independence and suspicious of Imperial intentions. While the governmental system on Tktk is nominally an anarchy, the planet does have a small democratically elected parliament that makes some key decisions on the population’s behalf. Members of Parliament participate on a part-time basis and assemble when an important decision must be made. A proclamation to approve or deny Imperial intervention has been tied up in deliberations for several years.

In addition to dangers posed to the tktks, there are hazards to the human population as well. Living in the Dustbelt has meant being subjected to raids, primarily from the Tyrian Lordships, but without a system defense squadron to speak of, the world is vulnerable to attacks from all quarters. Tktk’s primary defense against raiders is that there is so little of worth on the planet. Most people on Tktk are subsistence farmers or academics, with little in the way of wealth or capital.

Tktk’s humans have a highly communal culture and most of the patchwork residential communities have a surprisingly warm and cooperative feel to them. The residents of Laurb, for example, have pooled their resources to build a hospital and community center out of recycled advanced base parts. Capital is known for its twice-annual Civic Faire. In spite of the challenges, most human communities on the planet are exceedingly friendly and welcoming.

Tktk’s primary industry, if it can be said to have one, is scientific research in a plethora of disciplines. The most profitable of these is pharmaceuticals. Located in the void, Tktk is unfettered by Imperial law and manufactures all manner of products including controversial anagathic, combat, and psionic drugs. The low tech level of the planet and lack of regulation has resulted in a mishmash of products, some of them high quality and some that are unreliable or even dangerous.

Not all scientific endeavors on the planet are motivated by profit and many projects are undertaken purely for scientific curiosity. However, even “pure” scientists must make a living of some sort and many sell their research to offworld universities or corporations.

Tktk is a resource-poor world and has not attracted heavy industry of any kind. The only other enterprises of note are hydroponics, service industries, and tourism. Many of Tktk’s residents spend a portion of their time working as tour guides for offworlders. While Tktk is a difficult world to reach and it is located in a dangerous region of space, the grand spires and tktk population attract tourists from great distances.

Tktk’s social structure is primarily based on its research community and is, as such, communal in nature. People tend to help each other out. Homelessness, starvation, and problems that plague other worlds in the Bight are not issues on Tktk.

Tktk is a system surrounded by war and strife. Its neighboring systems have been either at war or in its aftermath for centuries, yet somehow the tiny planet has avoided becoming embroiled in the chaos. With the
