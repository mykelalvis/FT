Very much the gateway to [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]], Mora was the first area to be colonized by the [[Imperium]] and has developed steadily ever since. All worlds in the subsector are Imperial members and defended by the 73<sup>rd</sup> Fleet, which is based out of [[Mora]] itself. The [[Spinward Marches Sector Fleet]] is also headquartered at [[Mora]], although if a Depot system is someday designated it may move there.

In the meantime, the co-location of fleet headquarters and de facto sector ducal court has been criticized for creating an over-politicised fleet. Other observers suggest it enables better co-operation between the political structure of the [[Imperium]] and the [[Imperial Navy|Navy]], its main military arm. Either way, [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]] is behind the times in retaining a 'crust' defensive strategy when the move to elastic defence began elsewhere a decade ago.

The [[Imperial Navy]] has additional bases at [[Mercury]], [[Moran]] and [[Hexos]], which mostly play host to lighter fleet elements. Mora is more intensively patrolled than most other subsectors and has no less than four light carrier task groups available for anti-piracy and general security. This makes Mora safer for traffic, at the cost of taking fleet assets away from frontier areas that might need them more.
