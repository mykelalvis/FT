### THE VEXX

The Vexx are humans who were seeded on [[Condyole]] by the Ancients. Most Vexx are quite short and have a pale complexion. Vexx society is community based and everyone who has come of age is expected to work for the betterment of their people. Many follow in the footsteps of their parents but it is not uncommon for younger people to seek a mentor in a different vocation.

Around 1,000 years ago, they first became aware of other races when the [[Zhodani]] came to [[Condyole]]. There was little here of interest to the [[Zhodani]] and they soon left but their visit was the catalyst for technological advancement and the desire to reach the stars.

The technological revolution rapidly changed the Vexx society and the world they lived on. Heavy industry and nuclear power soon became commonplace and little thought was given to the potential consequences of their actions. During the  [[IY0207]], a number of nuclear reactors failed due to poor maintenance and lack of foresight. The cumulative effect of the devastating explosions eventually resulted in an ecological disaster that transformed [[Condyole]] to the dry wasteland it is today.

Many Vexx were killed in the initial explosions and many more died from the radiation. Those who lived in distant settlements survived and it was not long before the first underground complexes were built. The cataclysm changed the Vexx into the people they are today but the lessons had a heavy price.
