# Auuasmadshagmar Colonial Services

Auuasmadshagmar Colonial Services (ACS) takes its name from an old Vilani settlement which was for a long time thought to be their first outpost in the Trojan Reach. This claim is now disputed but the name continues to have connotations of long-established and enduring settlement, which suits the firm’s preferred image.

Auuasmadshagmar provides a variety of services in the exploration, settlement and development marketplace. Its survey teams create overview maps of a world or conduct detailed exploration of a region. This can include surveying possible settlement sites or generating a report on potential mineral resources. Depending on how much the client is willing to pay, Auuasmadshagmar will undertake a detailed investigation of the local ecosystem or simply present a few paragraphs of observations undertaken whilst carrying out other groundside work. Rather than investigating a site picked by the client, the firm is also able to provide a list of suitable locations for an installation from its own database or to go out and find one, though the latter is an expensive undertaking.

Auuasmadshagmar also offers a ‘proving and preparation’ service, whereby it lands a team at a potential colony or settlement site and ‘proves’ the location by having people live there for a suitable period. The proving team will continue to undertake surveys and exploration while they are on-site, and can provide a detailed final report with recommendations to the client when the proving period is over. A larger- scale operation is required for a preparation mission, wherein Auuasmadshagmar personnel set up a colony or settlement site ready for the first arrivals. This typically means flattening ground, constructing the first buildings to house new arrivals, and ensuring that new colonists do not have to build their new home town from the ground up.

This end of the market is typically undertaken by small field teams of four to six personnel, or larger deployments consisting of several field teams and a management group. Development operations are less common, and require more personnel. This can be anywhere between about twenty and hundreds of workers, administrators and support personnel. Auuasmadshagmar is able to undertake many tasks but is typically hired to develop a small colony quickly and efficiently in a manner that its own settlers cannot. Spaceport construction, roads, rivers and dams, and similar infrastructure builds can be undertaken along with important technical work ranging from installing a power and sewerage grid to setting up an advanced datanet.

Auuasmadshagmar personnel include engineers, construction workers, scientists, surveyors and computer technicians, and in addition the firm acts as a clearing house for colonial missions that require key personnel. For a fee it will find a doctor who wants to live in a frontier colony or a retiring police chief who can head up security. The firm has a good reputation and works hard to maintain it. Its personnel can be encountered in remote areas of mainworlds, distant moons or in transit from one job to another. They usually have hair-raising stories of narrow escapes to tell; colonial operations on the frontier are not for the faint-hearted.
