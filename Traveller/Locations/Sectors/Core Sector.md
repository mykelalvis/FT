From [[Third Imperium]]

# CORE SECTOR

Visitors to Core often find that it is not at all what they expected. There is a common misconception that the entire sector is one big, crowded extension of Capital, that all of its inhabitants are exorbitantly wealthy with robots and computers running every aspect of their lives and that Imperial patriotism runs thicker than blood in their veins. While there certainly is wealth to be had in the Core, and [[Capital]] does wield a wide sphere of influence, not every world is a bastion of technological development, covered in arcologies and industry, nor does everyone fly the Imperial flag with nationalist zealotry. It is quite the opposite in many ways. Core is in fact a disparate and diverse place where individualism runs rampant and there is little in the way of consistency or uniformity. This is by design, if one can truly say that controlled chaos is something to which the greatest interstellar empire in history aspires. The Imperium is working as intended.

For those who never manage to travel to the Core, the myths remain larger than life. This sector is thought to be a magical place, a hallowed region of space as unattainable as it is distant. While millions of sophonts travel among the stars at some point in time, the fact is that most remain on their worlds of origin for the duration of their lives. To a belter in the Empty Quarter, a merchant in the Spinward Marches or a starport administrator in the Solomani Rim, the Core is just a place seen in holovideos or read about in daily news feeds. Some Travellers dream of seeing its wonders for a lifetime but only a privileged few actually make the long journey to the Core and Capital, perhaps affording them a visit to the Grand Palace of Arbellatra itself.

The reality is that the Core is much like any other Imperial sector. It is a wealthy sector but not the wealthiest. It is populous but not the most populated. It has technological wonders aplenty but there are worlds elsewhere in the Imperium that have achieved levels beyond those of the Core. The sector certainly has a distinct character and unique features. It is home to [[Capital]] where the current and all former Emperors have sat upon the Iridium Throne and where the nobility meet at the Moot Spire. It is home to Reference, a world dedicated to the retention of all information ever collected by Humaniti. Some of the most powerful starships in existence have been built at its Imperial Navy Depot in a star system that was touched by the Ancients. Even after over 1,000 years, the Core's economy is among the mightiest in the Imperium. More goods are exported from its industrial worlds than from those of any other sector.

The Sylean Main is the Core's richest trade route, connecting [[Capital]] to the majority of the sector. Achenaar Antilles currently dominates shipping in the sector but the megacorporate lines are engaged with them in fierce economic combat for control of the sector's rich export business. While the big corporations duke it out for control, there is plenty of business for enterprising free traders to make a living.

Several alien races hail from the Core, including the [[Ssienjhiovla]], an aquatic species who have integrated themselves into Imperial society and the sagely but bloviating Bhu'oovaakaylaa, large and phlegmatic and virtually unseen beyond the confines of their homeworld. The Oo-ne-beto-pon-tee or 'whistlers' as some call them, a strange and potentially dangerous species, are under the watchful eye of the Imperial Navy on the isolated world of Night. Their ability to affect the minds of their human cohabitants is cause for concern. The dead race known as the Shingans were wiped from existence nearly 800 years ago, allegedly for having similar abilities. A recently discovered race called the Ganmeids have been found in the oceans of the windswept world of Indshiim Ganme, a mere seven parsecs from [[Capital]]. The Core is also home to several human Minor Races, none more famous or influential than the Syleans, whose unique philosophy enabled Humaniti to arise from the ashes of the Long Night.

Despite the presence of many human and alien races, the Vilani and Solomani have by far had the greatest impact on the sector. The Vilani first arrived approximately 7,500 years ago and called the sector Ukan. They left their mark in many ways, none more obvious than the many Vilani-named star systems. During the Interstellar Wars, the Terrans invaded and renamed many worlds, left some names intact and corrupted others with Galanglic influences. To some extent, the names of the Core's worlds tell the tale. The Terrans burst into the First Imperium in leaps and bounds, annexing and conquering high-value worlds and leaving lesser worlds in their wake. Many diamonds in the rough were overlooked during the invasion, which explains why many rich worlds still retain Vilani names and cultural heritage. After thousands of years of intermixing and the intercession of the Long Night, the Core is neither Vilani nor Solomani but somewhere in between.

The sector is a dynamic and ever-changing realm, and the structure of the Imperium does not lend itself to stasis. Individual worlds are free to determine their own destinies. There is a great deal of conflict and strife in the Core, just as there is anywhere else in the Imperium. Amidst all the wealth, gleaming palaces and gargantuan starships there is poverty, conflict, avarice, violence and every other human foible on display. This makes for a patchwork of freewheeling anarchies, authoritarian regimes, would-be utopias, struggling colonies, balkanised jigsaw puzzles and just about every other type of society that one can imagine. There is a greater concentration of high-tech and high-population worlds than on the frontiers. High-population worlds tend to have complex governments and high Law Levels as well. Authoritarianism runs strong in the heart of the Imperium.

The Core presents unique and exciting challenges for a group of Travellers. As one approaches Capital, the trappings of empire become increasingly evident. The burden of serving and protecting the Imperial throne world creates political and military intrigue throughout most of the Core and Kaskii subsectors. Branches extend from [[Capital]] like the nervous system of some great organism, making neighboring worlds an extension of its will. Nobles jockey for position in fiefs near the throne world. Because of their proximity to [[Capital]] and easy access to the Moot, the nobility here wield an outsized influence.

Portions of two defeated empires – the Interstellar Confederacy and the Chanestin Kingdom – and other worlds retain some semblance of independence and a distinct cultural flavor but most have been fully integrated into the Imperium. This does not mean that the sector is devoid of conflict. New squabbles have taken the place of the old, most centered on territorial disputes between various political rivals, noble houses, megacorporations and trade guilds. The Emperor and peerage watch brewing disputes carefully. The ties that bind the Imperium can be tenuous.

The Core is well defended by its numbered and sector fleets, which are the most powerful in all of the Imperium. The Core Sector Fleet is headquartered at Depot with a goodly portion of its fleet elements based at [[Capital]]. The Imperial Interstellar Scout Service has its bureaucratic headquarters at Reference, where it also berths multiple scout cruisers. Reference is also well-defended by the Imperial Navy due to its strategic importance.
