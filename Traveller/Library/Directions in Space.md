### DIRECTIONS IN SPACE

Directions like north or southwest are meaningless in space. Within a star system, most objects move in orbit about the star or a planet and movement can be defined with reference to a suitable point. Most bodies in a star system orbit in the same general plane, known as the ecliptic. One direction at 90 degrees to the ecliptic is defined by convention as 'system north' or 'up' and the other as 'system south' or 'down'.

Most movement within a system is defined in terms of going towards, or away from, a given body, usually the main world of the system or the star itself. The terms 'in-system' (towards the inner planets of the system and the star) or 'out-system' (away from the star) are also used. These are rather general terms but as navigation in three dimensions, whether along an orbital path or a straight line, is a complex business they serve for casual conversation. Of course, starship astrogators produce rather more detailed course plots using highly advanced mathematics...

Outside the confines of a star system, some frame of reference is needed to indicate relative positions. By convention the following terms are used:

- Coreward refers to the direction towards the galactic core.
- Rimward is the opposite direction to coreward, towards the galactic rim.
- Spinward means in the direction in which the galaxy is rotating.
- Trailing is the opposite of spinward; away from the direction of galactic rotation.

Some Imperial citizens also use the term coreward to mean towards the Imperial heartworlds, literally the 'Imperial Core'. This usage is generally obvious from context. For example, it should be fairly obvious that a magazine called Coreward Gazette deals with matters in the Imperial central region and not the center of the galaxy tens of thousands of light-years away.

#### Distances

Concepts like meters and kilometers are inadequate for the vast distances in space. Over relatively short distances, such as in orbital space, thousands or millions of kilometers are used as a measure. Larger distances in-system are measured using the Astronomical Unit, or AU. This is based on the distance of Earth's orbit from the Sun and is about 150,000,000 km.

The light-second is also used, defined as the distance light travels within a vacuum in one second. This is 299,792.458 km, usually rounded to 300,000 km. One AU is 499 light-seconds.

Over greater distances, still larger measures are needed. The light-year (the distance light travels in one standard Earth year) is sometimes used, equating to 63,241 AU. More commonly, the parsec (3.26 light-years) is used as this is the maximum distance that can be covered by a jump-1 capable starship.

Most Traveller starmaps use a scale of 1 parsec to 1 hex.

#### Astrographic Features

[[Charted Space]] has a few anomalies and interesting features. Stars tend to occur in groups (called clusters) or long chains (known as mains). Trade and commerce tends to move along the mains as they allow vessels to navigate between systems with ease. Crossing to another main requires a ship with longer range or some means to refuel in deep space.

Many clusters and segments of a main have their own cultural, astrographic or economic identity. These are sometimes named, such as the [[Bowman Arm]] in the [[Spinward Marches]], a segment of the Spinward Main centering on the [[Bowman]] system.

The empty space between clusters or mains is sometimes referred to as a rift. Small rifts are usually no more than 1-4 parsecs wide and hardly worthy of the name. Even the Great and Lesser Rifts of Charted Space are nothing compared to vast gulfs that can lie between the spiral arms of the galaxy. However, they are a significant navigational obstacle to vessels using jump drive technology.

A few odd features have been reported, though some may be nothing more than wild spacers' tales. A rosette system of five equidistant worlds orbiting a common star, that could not have occurred naturally, or the rumored ringworld located in the Vargr Extents. There are also a number of broken planets and shattered moons that may indicate a war of titanic proportions in the distant past.
