Introduction
The d66 series was inspired by my work on the
Ultimate Toolbox for AEG. If you are unfamiliar with that
book, it’s a 400-page tome full of fantasy names and
ideas laid out in random lists for d20-based games. That
book was a lot of fun to work on and people raved about
how it is possibly the must useful game aid in their
collection. I wanted to bring this boon to sci-fi games and
Traveller in particular.
With my (then) very young company writing game
aids for Traveller Role Playing Game, it seemed only
logical to set those first d66 lists in the Foreven Sector.
With the license affording me the ability to use terms
associated with the Official Traveller Universe, these lists
would be readily applicable to most Traveller games.
A year later, the d66 series has become one of the
best selling Traveller PDF series of all time. We at Jon
Brazer Enterprises are proud to bring you this
compendium. It represents the cumulation of a year’s
hard work and a year of people telling us how useful
these lists are to their game.
I would like to give a special thanks to Albert
“GamerDude” Beddow, Jr who wrote the Character/NPC
Names section single-handedly. In truth, he delivered
more than we could fit in this book. We only wish that we
could have used them all. I feel the book is greatly
enhanced by his efforts. Thank you, sir.
We hope you enjoy this compendium as much as we
enjoyed creating it.
How To Use This Book
In your hands, you hold inspiration for players and
referees alike. This book contains the names of allies and
enemies, ships and guns, the planet your character grew
up on and the space station of his last assignment. It
describes tattoos on your character’s arm or the
emblem’s on a villain’s flight suit. The d66 Compendium
is designed to give you all the inspiration you need when
your players are asking for more details or when your
imagination needs a boost.
Each list in this book contains 36 options laid out in a
standard d66 format. Choose the list most appropriate to
your need with the help of the Table of Contents above or
the Index on page 47. To randomly select a list-entry, role
2d6’s and read them like percentile dice. Example: if you
role a 4 and a 1, select number 41 on the list. Using two
different color or size dice and deciding which is the ten’s
place and which is the one’s place will keep down
confusion. Alternatively, you can simply ignore the
numbers and choose the entry on the list you like when
the need arises.

# D66 Compendium 2

Welcome to the **D66 Compendium 2**. If you have
not checked out its predecessor, I highly recommend
doing so. No list from the first book is reproduced
in this book. Some cover similar themes, but all the
entries in these books are unique unto themselves.
As I mentioned in the introduction to the **d
Compendium** , the idea for our d66 list series
originally came from the _Ultimate Toolbox_ from AEG,
which I helped write. However, space limitations
required that I cut some details. The first list of names
I wrote for a roleplaying game came years before
then. While running a _Star Wars_ game (WEG d6, 2nd
Edition), I had to come up with a planet name in a
hurry, and I named it “Yaffa” after the blocks, because
it was on a commercial the group saw before playing
the game. Afterwards, one of the players suggested I
write a list of names of people and planets so I would
not have to think of one in the moment. That is a trick
I have used in every game I have run since. So, the
first D66 lists I published were lists that I created for
my own use.

Once I realized that I could go beyond simple
names and could detail inspiration for plots, twists,
and ways to increase mayhem, D66 lists became a
whole new thing. Now these lists are more than just
simple names, and can even provide inspiration for
quick plots on the fly. As every Game Master knows,
players always take games in directions that were not
planned for. So, when the players go in a direction
you never expected them to, these new lists can help
you to adapt to the change in plans.

More than anything else, the **D66 Compendium 2**
is all about the experience of gameplay. These ideas
are here to make your game go smoothly, to make
you look prepared when you have nothing, to provide
detail and differentiate one location from the next.
We all crave an experience to excite and inspire us
and to take us to locations we have always wanted
to go. Sure, prepublished adventures can give you
many of the tools needed for a session, but there
are always ways to enhance the experience even
further. For busy Game Masters looking for an edge,
the compendium will make preparing for and running
a game more enjoyable. We hope this book helps to
create the best experience possible, both for Game
Masters and players.

No matter what edition of Traveller you play, this
book is ideal for it. Additionally, this book can help
you beyond the _Traveller Roleplaying Game_ , in any
science fiction roleplaying game. Anytime you need
ship names, details on where a criminal is hiding,
strange names for aliens that are easy to pronounce,
or reasons for a planet-wide quarantine, this book
will be right there to help you. Be sure to tell not only
your friends that play Traveller, but also any fans of
sci-fi roleplaying games you know, about the D

## Using This Book and Overview

If you are unfamiliar with the concept of a D66, it
goes like this: take two D6s (preferably two that you
can tell apart after rolling), decide which is the 10's
place and which is the 1's place, roll them and read
the results like you would percentile dice. Lists of
ideas that use a D66 contain thirty-six entries. So,
if you need to randomly determine what someone's
homeworld is like or if you need the name of a
science vessel, just roll the dice and there you have
it. Alternatively, you can just choose an option from
the list, but if you want to surprise both your players
as well as yourself, we recommend rolling the dice.

What is the D66 Compendium 2? The book
and its predecessor are there to help you when you,
the Game Master, are in a jam and need an idea
for your game. This book of inspiration can give
new life and excite your players in what could very
well be a dull and otherwise unremarkable location.
Arriving on a new planet can feel pretty humdrum
until you describe the people as wearing holographic
clothing or when you mention that a weighted-down
hovercraft crashes and scatters its cargo. That
collection of lists is designed to provide you with
details on the fly to liven up your games. All the lists
are divided into the following sections.

Character Creation. This section is comprised
almost entirely of new lists. It covers everything from
what your home environment was like to details
about a contact of yours. The core of this section is a
set of alternate event tables for each of the careers.
These will really help to flesh out your character in
greater detail. The Home Overview table jumpstarts
your ideas about the kind of place you grew up.
Use the Background Events table in place of one
of your Background skills to provide some depth
to your formative years. The next group of tables
details events for all the careers in the Traveller
Core Rulebook. These events can be used with any
roleplaying game with a life-path style of character
generation. The final table helps you to come up with
an idea of how a Contact is most useful.
Crime and the Law. Originally this was two
different sections. I decided to merge them when I
realized that they were just two sides of the same
coin. A military person might be a guard at a prison
while a criminal might be locked up in that same
prison. The military might be intercepting a narcotics
shipment, and a criminal might be involved in
smuggling those same drugs. The military might be
looking for a pirate base or a criminal might pick up
work there. Biometric, security scanners, gambling
games, items customs will not allow on planet—they
are all equally useful to criminals and military and
law enforcement, albeit in different ways. There are a
few lists here that are more applicable to one group
than the other. Lists for prison inmate names, names
of space battles and interstellar wars, or details of a
criminal hideout are not going to be used by everyone
but still have their place with the more applicable
group.

**Exploration.** When boldly going where you have
never gone before, this is a good section to have
handy. It is mostly applicable to a world off the edge
of charted space, but it is equally valid for worlds that
neither you nor your players have seen before but are
otherwise well known to humanity. This section will
help to describe the kind of fruits native to this planet,
any taint in the atmosphere, names of large features,
and so on. A favorite list of mine gives a number of
reasons for why a planet might be dead. A planet that
no longer/never could support life without significant
technological assistance must have a reason why it
cannot do so, which can range from overpopulation
destroying the food supply to cooling of the planet's
core.
**Ships.** The original _d66 Compendium_ had 6 lists
of generic ship names, so for this book we spent
time focusing on specific kinds of ships. The ship
names included in this section cover ship names
most appropriate for cargo carriers, criminal/pirate
vessels, sleeper transports, medical ships, personal
spacecraft, scientific vessels, and battle frigates. Of
course, you can always name a personal yacht the
Orca or a generation ship the Guiding Star, but we
feel the names are most appropriate to the listed
ship's purpose. The final list details reasons behind
ship wrecks. These do not have to be obvious
right away to the players, and in fact characters
investigating the crash can have these inflicted
on their own vessel as well. Try not to laugh too
maniacally when you do so.

Traveller Life. More than anything else, this
section is a catch-all for anything that would come
up in a typical game session. So, you have lists of
spaceport city names, bureaucracies that players
have to deal with, reasons for an amber or red travel
zone, ways to make a panicked situation worse,
reasons why an ally cannot help the players, the local
fashion, sports team names, and pets. Pets is a last
minute addition. I was watching a bunch of cat videos
one day and realized that people in the future will love
their pets just as much as we do today.

Terra System. This section focuses on Earth-
centric games, whether this involves the Solomani
from the Third Imperium or some other setting
involving humans colonizing the stars. I should state
that many of the places on the Moon and Mars lists
are named after real locations on these respective
locations. For example, Shakespeare is a real location
on the Moon so we included Shakespeare Towne on
this list. These lists have uses far beyond our solar
system. Any Solomani world would name locations
after details from home. So, naming a city Jules Verne
would work on any place where Earth humans can be
found in large numbers.

Third Imperium. Just like in the original d
Compendium , the final chapter of this book focuses
around names for the various races in the Third
Imperium setting. At your request, we made sure
to include Darrian names. The vast majority of the
names here are pronunciations instead of the way
someone would actually write them down. This way,
you can tell it to your players with minimal effort and
choose to spell it however you want. I recommend
that you simply remove the dashes, but you should
feel free to make the spelling more elaborate, if you
so desire.
