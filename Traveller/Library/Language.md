### Language

Most people throughout Imperial space and in the Solomani Confederation speak Galanglic as their first language, and it is widely understood elsewhere. Local dialects and accents vary considerably, and on some backwater worlds basic Galanglic is so mangled that it sounds like a foreign tongue. However, as a rule a Galanglic speaker can make himself understood anywhere.

Various preâ€“Starflight [[Terra|Terran]] languages are in use in some areas, as well as the native tongues of alien races. Vilani is spoken in cultural Vilani areas, and some purists will even refuse to speak any other language. This is rare outside the immediate region around Vland however.
