House Mallor is currently ruled by [[Count Mallor|Count Vincent Mallor]] who rose to fame at the beginning of the Fourth Frontier War for successfully defending Emerald against a superior [[Zhodani]] fleet in 1083. Shortly after this victory he was give the title of Count Mallor and the governorship of Zircon.

House Mallor has had a distinguished service in the [[Imperium]] but since ruling [[Zircon]], Count Mallor has recently started to see the [[Imperium]] in a different light. The activities of the [[Liberation Front]] and other separatists have led him to believe that no matter what the intentions of the [[Imperium]] and the good that it has done, there are those who value their freedom above this.

Imposing their rule over weaker civilizations is nothing short of dictatorship and the count has personally seen the effect with varying degrees of hostility aimed at him since he took control of Zircon. Although Count Mallor does not agree with all of the actions of the Liberation Front, he does empathise with them and plans to use the separatist movement to gain the support of his people.

The countâ€™s political ambitions are now focussed on seceding from the [[Imperium]] and becoming an independent world. However, before he can move against the Imperium, he must first deal with the Federation of Arden who are more of an immediate threat to his power base and ambition.
