With the exception of two worlds ([[Mertactor]] and [[Mille Falcs]] â€“ although several other worlds are client states), District 268 lies entirely outside the [[Imperium]]. It is, however, an area of Imperial interest. Such regions are designated as districts until such time as they are brought into the fold of the [[Imperium]], at which point they are assigned a suitable subsector name along with the usual Imperial administrative apparatus and subsector fleet.

Most of the worlds of the subsector are on the [[Spinward Main]], although its meandering path may require a detour into the [[Sword Worlds]] to reach some. All worlds are within jump-2 of the main, however. There are two areas of empty space within the subsector, which restrict traffic, lying to spinward-coreward and trailing-rimward of [[Collace]]. They are unofficially known as the Greater and Lesser Collace Rifts respectively.

Imperial businesses are active in District 268, although [[McClellan Factors]] is engaged in actively squeezing out its rivals, sailing close to the wind with some of its tactics. The Imperial worlds of [[Mertactor]] and [[Mille Falcs]] are used as a regional base for Imperial firms trading into the subsector and administered from the neighboring [[Glisten subsector]].

There is no subsector fleet, as such, for District 268 but patrols are maintained from the [[Five Sisters Subsector|Five Sisters]] into the spinward side of the district and from [[Glisten Subsector|Glisten]] into trailing. In addition, a small force of patrol vessels is based out of [[Mille Falcs]]. This is officially a detachment of the Glisten force but operates independently and comprises a handful of patrol vessels and escorts, backed up by a couple of old destroyers.

Probably the most important non-Imperial world in District 268 is [[Collace]], a high-tech industrial world with pro-[[Imperial]] leanings and a strong contender for the role of subsector capital if and when the district is absorbed. However, many worlds want nothing of the [[Imperium]] and are passively resistant to Imperial expansion. Among them is [[Trexalon]], which has been involved in a cold war with [[Collace]] for many years. The government of [[Trexalon]] and the [[Trexalon Technical Consortium]] (TTC) it leads knows the [[Imperium]] will not tolerate armed resistance and can bring vast forces to bear if they start attacking Imperial facilities and ships.  Resistance is thus below the level that will trigger an Imperial response. There are, however, rumors that the TTC is behind a number of insurrections and similar problems on pro-Imperial worlds.

The world of [[Nirton]] is a [[Red Zone]] and there are three [[Amber Zone]]s in the subsector. [[Pavabid]] is one of these, where the world government is a theocracy that follows the Pavabidian Heresy (as it is called elsewhere) of the [[Church of Stellar Divinity]]. Like other branches of the church, the Pavabidian version believes that stars are holy but maintains that all stars other than [[Pavabid]]'s are evil. Offworlders are from enemy stars and highly suspect. The world is governed from a flying palace that the locals, kept in a state of mid-tech ignorance, are told is kept aloft by divine favor. In fact, it was built on [[Glisten]] and uses gravitic technology.

[[Bowman]] is the site of one of the largest planetoid fields in existence, which covers five orbital paths rather than one. The system has only one planet, a gas giant known as Bowman Prime, whose moons are inhabited, as are sections of the vast Bowman Belt. Most of the prospecting and mining in Bowman is done by independents and small firms but LSP has a large facility in-system and occasionally expands its operation, to the annoyance of locals who feel they are being edged out.
