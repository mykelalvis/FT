### THE ANCIENTS

Little is known about the Ancients and it is probable that most of what is known is inaccurate. Various theories have been put forward, most of which have insurmountable flaws. Most scientists agree that the Ancients reached the height of their power several hundred thousand years ago and their disappearance coincides with a fair amount of damage to Charted Space; there are several asteroid belts and devastated worlds dating from that period. The most popular explanation is that they fought each other, or someone else, to mutual destruction.

Various Ancient devices and sites have been found, along with larger numbers of mistaken and outright fraudulent finds. Trade in Ancient artefacts is heavily restricted but there are always those who will pay Credits for a working item.

The Ancients are thought to have been responsible for transplanting many species, including humans and Vargr. They may have terraformed worlds, or seeded them with life, and are probably responsible for the presence of [[Terra|Terran]] plants and animals on worlds only now being charted by humans.

The wonders of the Ancients are mostly lost and those found are often incomprehensible. Devices are discovered that have no known function and those that can be used remain mysterious. The Ancients and their technology are something of a modern superstition; any unexplained phenomenon tends to be blamed on the Ancients.
