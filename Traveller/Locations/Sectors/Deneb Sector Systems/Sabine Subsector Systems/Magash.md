### MAGASH

Magash is a forbidding rockball world but in a system with no habitable planets one ball of rock is as good as another. Magash was located a convenient distance from the system's primary and its close companion star, so was chosen as the system's mainworld. Ease of navigation was not the only factor in the selection; Magash had good natural resources that facilitated early development.

Magash was intended from the outset to be a major industrial center and received heavy investment; incentives were offered to persuade colonists to move to the underground cities of Magash rather than one of the more pleasant worlds in the region. This was not a single-world project; Magash was to be the hub of industry in the surrounding systems, creating a self-
supporting expansion program.

Although the project was not a total success, Magash did indeed develop into a high-tech manufacturing center and was soon exporting machinery and equipment to developing colonies on nearby worlds. It then became the seat of the Duke of Sabine when the subsector's senior nobility were appointed.

Magash has few structures visible above ground and the population of around eight billion are housed within city-complexes dispersed around the globe. Although each has the identity of a single city, they are built in a chain of artificial caverns. Each has its own amenities and can function independently in the event of disaster cutting off power or water supplies, although not all have access to the surface. Some cavern-cities within a complex are specialist areas, including the ducal city and several hazardous-materials handling facilities, but most are a large and diversified city in their own right, forming a module within each larger city-complex.

Each city-complex is self-governing and has its own spaceport. In addition, there are specialist ports dotted all over the surface. Incoming traffic from other systems goes by way of the excellent orbital port, with most visitors and traders never descending to the world itself.
Some in-system traffic uses the highport but bulk ore carriers and chemical tankers instead operate out of a second orbital port dedicated to such large commercial vessels. From there, materials are transferred groundside by an armada of interface shuttles.

Magash's outsystem industry uses a curious set-up dating from the early expansion, whereby each of the major city-complexes was given responsibility for the development of a segment of the system. The two planetoid belts are subdivided into zones, each feeding ore and minerals into the industrial sector of a single city-complex. Mines on the moons of the system's gas giants and terrestrial worlds are likewise controlled and operated from their assigned city-complex, as are chemical extraction rigs skimming hydrocarbons from the four gas giants.

The Magash system is thus a hive of activity, with extraction operations feeding into the commercial port then down to the city-complexes and finished goods leaving the system by way of the main highport.
The commercial spacing sector alone outnumbers the population of some worlds and not surprisingly is protected by a large in-system patrol force. Magash itself is protected by several deep-site meson gun emplacements and a force of heavily armored monitors.

The scout base at Magash orbits the mainworld and is the local reserve vessel repository. In addition to x-boats and survey craft, large numbers of specialist vessels and additional couriers are held at the base, ready to respond to sudden need. These include jump-6 fast couriers used to convey urgent messages between government centres in an emergency. The Duke of Sabine applies constant pressure to borrow these ships but the Scout Service has thus far resisted.

Orbital traffic over Magash is nightmarishly complex.  perhaps one reason why the Imperial Navy chose to locate regional bases elsewhere. The navy does visit, of course, and routinely puts a cruiser through the highport every few weeks to show the flag.
