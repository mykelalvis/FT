The Empress Iolanthe is descended from a prominent Vilani family and the daughter of the senior duke of the [[Gushemege sector]]. Iolanthe married [[Emperor Strephon Aella Alkhalikoi|Strephon]] in 1079 after a brief courtship. Their union was an arranged pairing, designed to infuse the Alkhalikoi Dynasty with some much-needed Vilani blood.

Iolanthe travels a great deal and has become an advocate for the Imperial cultural regions. Her pilgrimages thus far have taken her to the [[Vegan Autonomous Region]], the [[Lancian Cultural Region]], the [[Amec Protectorate]], the [[League of Antares]] and the [[Luriani Cultural Association]]. Locally, she travels amongst the [[Sylean Worlds]] frequently, partaking in many ceremonies and festivals that celebrate Sylean heritage. While Iolanthe has no Sylean blood to speak of, as Empress of an [[Imperium]] that owes a great debt to the Syleans, she feels it is her responsibility and great honor to support and foster their culture.

The Empress has been quiet so far on whether or not she supports the notion of a Chanestin cultural region. The Chanestin worlds are a source of internecine strife in the Core, so she is careful not to stir the pot by advocating one way or the other. She does express great admiration for the historical achievements of the Chanestin people and actively engages in fund-raising activities to preserve their unique and ancient architectural monuments, some of which are now nearly 3,000 years old.
