#### Gas-Sharks

Gas-sharks are native to the atmosphere of several gas giant worlds within [[Deneb Sector|Deneb]] and elsewhere in [[Charted Space]]. They may be the same species that has somehow spread throughout the universe or could be an example of parallel evolution. Either way, gas-sharks do not resemble any form of aquatic creature; their name is fanciful but has stuck. They take the form of a cloud of dense gaseous matter or vapour, which does not appear to contain any organs or anything similar in function.  Gas-sharks are mildly corrosive and can eat their way into a starship given time. However, they are more likely to enter through fuel scoops or attach themselves to the hull of a vessel that enters their territory.

Gas-sharks feed on a variety of chemicals present in a gas giant's atmosphere, metabolising them by breaking down organic matter and some inorganic compounds.  Among these are lubricants and seals used in many types of shipboard equipment. A gas-shark can be disrupted (say by passing through a fuel filter) but will reform, apparently unharmed, in a matter of hours.

Very little is known about these creatures, other than they are dangerous. There are reports of contact with them all over the sector but no reliable picture has emerged of which gas giants are infested and which are not. Skimming fuel or otherwise entering the atmosphere of an infested gas giant does not guarantee contact and a previously 'safe' fuel skimming site might conceal a colony... or perhaps a lone gas-shark might have been carried there aboard an ill-fated starship.

Hand weapons and projectiles have no effect on them other than to stir the cloud around a little. Likewise lasers are largely ineffective and will damage whatever they hit on the far side of the cloud (a laser fired at a gas-shark does one point of damage per die – so a 5D laser weapon will deal 5 points of damage).

Electricity and similar forms of energy will harm a gas-shark and Stun weapons deliver damage as normal. High temperatures (such as plasma or flame weapons) will also harm a gas-shark but may be inadvisable inside a spacecraft.

A Traveller touched by a gas-shark will be slowly dissolved at the rate of 1D damage per round. Armor is dissolved at the rate of 1 point of Protection per round and once reduced to zero, it is gravely breached and useless. A gas-shark may well find ways into a sealed suit before then. There is a 1 in 6 chance each round of contact with the Traveller by way of a breached seal.
This is not sufficient to cause a suit to fail completely but will result in a leak that could become serious.
