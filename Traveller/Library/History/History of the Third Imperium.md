The Third Imperium is the self-appointed successor of two previous empires that existed thousands of years ago. The first of these was the Vilani Grand Empire of the Stars or Ziru Sirka as they called it in their native language. With their homeworld and capital at Vland, the Ziru Sirka became the largest interstellar empire in history. The Vilani were descended from humans who were originally taken from Terra approximately 300,000 years ago by an alien race who are now called the Ancients. The Ancients mysteriously disappeared from the galactic scene but the Vilani lived on and discovered jump drive technology in -9235, nearly seven millennia before their Terran counterparts. They engaged in a long, largely unopposed expansion into the stars, first exploring and trading, and then consolidating and conquering the sophonts they encountered. Vilani culture adhered to a strict caste system that focused on tradition, conservatism and the cautious use of technology. The Ziru Sirka reached its apex in approximately -3500 when it was composed of 15,000 star systems spread across 27 sectors of space.

After thousands of years, the Vilani had begun to struggle with the management of their vast empire and it was in decline by -3000. They had divided it among agencies called Bureaux, each of which promulgated the Vilani caste system and methods of government. The fact that the Vilani had only achieved jump-2 technology meant that travel and communication was slow and ponderous. By -2500 the Vilani could no longer secure their frontier from the barbarian states beyond their borders, including the Vargr to coreward and the Terrans to rimward. They first encountered Terran explorers in -2422 at a remote mining outpost on Barnard, a mere two parsecs from Terra. The first meetings between the Vilani and Terrans were peaceful. The Vilani had already encountered and integrated many human Minor Races during the expansion of their empire and they assumed the Terrans were simply another such race. However, first contact was a monumental affair for the Terrans, who had never encountered extra-terrestrial life before and were especially shocked when they encountered other humans with subtle physical differences.

A mere 23 years after the first meeting between the Terrans and Vilani, the first of a series of wars broke out between them that became known as the Interstellar Wars. After realising the massive size and industrial base of their enemy, the Terrans engaged in a program of technological development and population expansion. Despite the immensity and breadth of the Vilani Imperium, the Terrans soon discovered that they faced a decaying empire, one with little hope of standing up to a motivated, rapidly advancing opponent. Unlike the Vilani, the Terrans had no qualms about technology. In fact, it became an existential imperative for the Terrans to advance as quickly as possible in order to oppose the massive Vilani Imperium.

The Interstellar Wars were a mixed affair. The Terrans encountered pockets of strong resistance as they branched out into Vilani territory but they also discovered just how decayed and unstable the Ziru Sirka had become, especially on its rimward frontier. Many Vilani worlds willingly submitted to Terran authority; some were even eager to join them. Others looked upon the Terrans as interlopers or invaders but were not given sufficient resources by the central government to fight back against Terran aggression. The Terrans worked their way through Vilani space, fighting when they had to and annexing worlds when they did not. After 200 years, the depleted Ziru Sirka surrendered to the Terrans and the Second Imperium was born. The Terrans referred to this empire as The Rule of Man.

The Terrans were accustomed to democratic government but it soon became clear that they would have to change their thinking when it came to the administration of a widespread interstellar empire. The commander-in-chief of Terran military forces, Admiral Hiroshi Estigarribia, broke with Terran High Command and took personal control of the Empire. Rather than letting it be run from Terra with all its politics and rivalries, Hiroshi moved the capital to Hub (now called Kaggushus) in the Massilia sector. When announcing this to the empire in a speech in High Vilani, Hiroshi introduced himself and his people for the first time as the ‘Solomani’. After 200 years of expansion, the invaders were no longer strictly ‘Terran’ anymore. Generations had been born on conqueredand colonized worlds. Many were newly made clones or the descendants of clones who had been mass produced in an effort to achieve  greater parity with the Vilani. The Terrans had also uplifted many species native to their homeworld in a desperate effort to fill vacant roles in their military and on their starships. The word ‘Solomani’ reflected their origin in the Sol system but was inclusive of those who had not been born on Terra itself. Although Hiroshi never declared himself Emperor, his son accepted the title and was crowned Emperor Hiroshi II, posthumously declaring his father to have been Hiroshi I.

The Rule of Man was a tumultuous time. The Terran Navy had spread out far and wide to absorb the entirety of the Ziru Sirka. While officers of flag rank were tasked with governing the most prestigious worlds, junior officers were often left in charge of backwaters and remote outposts. The Terrans and Vilani began to intermix and new societies developed that featured elements of both cultures. Over the course of their expansion, the Solomani came into contact with numerous human subspecies, all of whom had also been transplanted to various worlds by the Ancients. They adopted the collective name Humaniti to encompass all human races that had been found.

The Vilani managed their empire through ancient and established tradition, and the arrival of the Solomani with their new ideas and concepts of personal freedom destroyed those traditions. Without that reliance on the old ways, the Solomani had no ability to manage such an enormous empire and the Rule of Man collapsed in less than five centuries, a mere blink of an eye in the long history of Humaniti. Historians cite -1776 as the beginning of the end when the Central Treasury on Hub refused to honor a monetary issue from the branch treasury of Antares. This caused a general collapse of the financial system and the government’s ability to make or control policy. The last claimant to the throne of the Rule of Man made their capital on Sylea in the Core sector.

The onset of what became known as the Long Night brought about a decline in interstellar trade, diplomacy and communication. This resulted in a sharp decline in technology on many worlds and populations that could not be maintained without a constant flow of supplies either emigrated to worlds that could sustain them or simply died off. Solitary worlds and small polities of a few worlds were scattered throughout Charted Space with huge expanses of barren star systems between them. Most worlds lost the capacity to build jump drives and became isolated islands in the vast reaches of space. Citizens of many worlds lived their entire lives without the ability to reach out to neighboring stars, some of which were only a parsec away. The Long Night was also a dangerous time. Pirates and reavers roamed space, preying upon defenseless worlds and attacking the few remaining starships that dared to travel between the stars. Over a 1,000 years passed before the lights of interstellar civilization began to re-emerge. The brightest of these lights shone on Sylea, the world that was the last vestige of the previous empire. Even as darknessdescended, Sylea had established itself as the last world of the Rule of Man. When the curtain finally began to lift, it was Sylea that once again led the way.

> [!info]- THE THREE IMPERIUMS
> In reality, there has only ever been a _Third_ Imperium. Its predecessors, the Ziru Sirka and Rule of Man were never referred to as ‘imperiums’ during the eras in which they existed but using the terms First, Second and Third Imperium simplifies the terminology and makes for a convenient narrative.
>
> The First Imperium was the Ziru Sirka or ‘Grand Empire of the Stars’ of the Vilani. After the Terrans defeated the Vilani in the Interstellar Wars, the victorious successor state has been given several names over the course of history. Terran Admiral Hiroshi Estigarribia declared it to be the Rule of Man, which was meant to emphasise the common heritage of Humaniti whether they be of Solomani, Vilani or other origin. Many academics still use the term since it is indeed the title that the conquerors gave to themselves, adding validity to the old adage that ‘History is told by the victors’.
>
> Over time, this term was politicised and Rule of Man became the Solomani-supremacist name of choice. Extremists among them attempted to instil a revisionist history in which the name was not in fact intended to establish unity between the various human subspecies but to convey the superiority of the conquerors. There have been  rallies and demonstrations in Solomani space that rather unrealistically clamour for the reinstatement of the Rule of Man based on specious arguments that the Solomani-dominated state was never officially dissolved.
>
> The disparaging term Ramshackle Empire was invented during the Long Night, replacing the Rule of Man for those who blamed the empire for ushering in the fall of interstellar civilization. For those who wish neither to celebrate nor denigrate the short-lived human empire, the neutral term Second Imperium as adopted in reference to the fact that it was the successor to the nominal First Imperium.
> In more recent centuries, Solomani rabble rousing has caused an academic schism of sorts, resulting in the adoption of Ramshackle Empire as the go-to for many academics in Imperial space. While this derisive term does little to fully convey the events that occurred during the pre-Long Night era, it does get the point across that Solomani rule was often authoritarian and unwelcome. History has not shined a kind light on this brief era and usage of the term Ramshackle Empire has gained steam as a result. In modern times one finds all three terms used, often resulting in heated debate.

# The Sylean Federation

The Long Night was a long and grievous affair that marked the end of large-scale interstellar civilization, the complete breakdown of communication between star systems and a descent into barbarism. Charted Space became a lawless place where pirates and reavers roamed and took what they wanted without consequences. Despite the darkness of the era, civilization managed to eke out a perilous existence, first on thousands of isolated worlds and eventually among dozens of ‘pocket empires’, small collections of worlds that had somehow managed to maintain – or, in some cases, reobtain – jump drive technology, enabling them to establish tenuous links between each other. These pocket empires were a shadow of the great empires of the past but nonetheless managed to keep the fragile flame of interstellar civilization alive.

In the Core sector, there were three prominent pocket empires, several smaller ones and scores of isolated worlds that had managed to survive. The three dominant polities of the sector were the Sylean Federation, the Interstellar Confederacy and the Chanestin Kingdom. Of the three, the Syleans were the most ambitious, the ones who had plans to restore the greatness of Humaniti.

When the Long Night descended upon Sylea, the world had an eclectic mix of ethnicities. Sylea was one of many worlds in Charted Space to host a human Minor Race (for more about the Syleans, see Sylean Travellers on page 171). Vilani colonists had settled and intermixed with the Syleans starting in approximately -9100. The Syleans were largely ignored and marginalised by the Vilani. After thousands of years of intermixing, there were few pureblood Syleans remaining but some isolated communities had maintained complete genetic purity. Vilani culture had come to dominate the world and oppress its indigenous population during the era of the Ziru Sirka but Syleans still engaged in traditional cultural activities and practiced their own religions, often in secret. The arrival of the Solomani during the Rule of Man heralded a revival of Sylean culture. The Solomani elevated Syleans to positions of power on their homeworld after thousands of years of oppression. Unbeknownst to the Solomani, this would pave the way for great things to come. After the Long Night began, the revival of Sylean culture took many centuries to fully flower but eventually became a key component in the rise of the Sylean Federation and its successor state, the Third Imperium.

By -900, Sylea was one of a handful of worlds that had regained some semblance of pre-Long Night technology. The Syleans had reacquired fusion power and ascended to TL9. With a small number of starships, they began to reach out to star systems around them in an effort to restore diplomatic relations, communication and most importantly, trade. Sylea was run by a majority-Solomani monarchy during much of the Long Night, but by -650 the people threw off the yoke of authoritarian rule. Under pressure from its feudal nobility, Queen Rowena abdicated the throne. The monarchy was replaced by the Sylean Grand Senate and a president in the executive role.

Sylean scouts began to travel to a growing circle of star systems. By -500, the Sylean Federation had come to include 18 systems. After much debate, the Grand Senate determined it was time to reach out to other pocket empires as well. Dozens of expeditions were formed, the most ambitious of which made it to far-off Vland in -495. Vland had also begun to travel to neighboring systems and did not take kindly to the Sylean intruders, initially expelling them from Vilani space. Undeterred, the Syleans sent more missions to Vland and, with careful diplomacy, established a trade corridor with the Vilani in -480. Travel between Sylea and Vland was perilous during this era. The route was riddled with craven pirates, dead worlds and xenophobic remnant civilizations. Even so, it gave the Syleans confidence that they might one day rebuild some semblance of interstellar civilization.

As the Sylean Federation grew, senators from frontier worlds pressed for continued expansion. These worlds enjoyed the benefits of being members of the Federation but were exposed to the dangers of uncivilised space just beyond its borders. In -384, this caused a rift in the Grand Senate, creating two factions: the Democrats and the Expansionists. The former wanted to preserve and cultivate what Sylea had created thus far and the latter wanted to continue to build upon it, expanding ever outward to worlds with which contact had been lost during the Long Night. By the mid -350s a third faction developed: the Industrialists, who sought a more equitable distribution of the Federation’s growing wealth. Things were changing rapidly and the Grand Senate and its president struggled to keep up with the pace.

Up to this point, Sylean scout and naval fleets were a ragtag bunch of starships, cobbled together by fledgling manufacturing firms. The ship-building firm Gesellschaft feur Sternschiffbau AG – abbreviated as GSbAG or ‘Gas Bag’ as it is popularly known – was financed by a group of wealthy senators and quickly rose to the top of the ship construction industry. GSbAG’s contract to build Federation Navy ships in -334 cemented its position, making it a near monopoly.

Sylea’s rapidly advancing industrial concerns carried them to Tech Level 11. Its starships acquired jump-2 capability, extending the Federation’s reach. Sylean scouts discovered that their growing empire was not alone in the Core sector when they visited the Heraldia system in -301 and encountered ships from the Interstellar Confederacy. The Syleans desperately wanted access to the spinward trade routes, but the Interstellar Confederacy was not prepared to willingly give them up or share them. The two empires engaged in occasional skirmishes and wars for three centuries before the Confederacy ultimately fell to Sylean forces.

# The Interstellar Confederacy

![[TImp-6168.jpg|50]]
In the [[Bunkeria Subsector]] and [[Cemplas subsector]]s of Core, there were a string of worlds known collectively as the Great Spiral that managed to survive the Long Night relatively intact. Not every world along this string had made it through unscathed but over time, outposts and small starports were built on ‘gap worlds’ so that eventually they had a serviceable jump-1 main established.

In -684, a politician from Sketola by the name of Rom Debeshuut united the worlds of the Great Spiral into the Interstellar Confederacy. The primary goal of this union was to restore interstellar trade, provide for mutual self-defense and preserve the technology of the four or five systems that had achieved TL12. The leaders of the Interstellar Confederacy ‘met as equals’ in a Grand Senate on Sketola.

In -623, after expanding to 32 star systems, the Interstellar Confederacy abruptly stopped accepting new members. The senators determined this was the maximum number that they could manage and that taking on more systems would have a deleterious effect on their ability to retain the Tech Levels that they had so assiduously built.

The Interstellar Confederacy first encountered scouts from the Sylean Federation in -301. Relations started poorly and the two quickly became enemies. Initially, the conflicts between them were limited to commerce raiding but by -260, they engaged in open war. In one of the war’s more famous battles, a Sylean naval squadron routed the Confederacy Navy at Velpare in -258 but failed to occupy the planet after an ill-advised and poorly executed siege. The Confederacy was humbled by the defeat but the inability of the Syleans to take the world itself prevented them from gaining a strong foothold in the region.

In -239 the Confederacy suffered a civil war. Rebel forces from its spinward arm conquered the capital at Sketola and held it for two years before loyalists were able to take it back. They tried to recover from this self-inflicted wound but the damage was done. A broken and demoralised Confederacy faced a rapidly expanding Sylean Federation. The Confederacy was ultimately done in by internal divisions and an unwillingness to expand its membership when it had the opportunity to do so.

Loyalist forces resisted the Syleans for another century but it became a matter of when, not if, the Confederacy would eventually collapse. Intense battles were fought on Velpare and Heraldia in -201 but after both fell to the Syleans, resistance crumbled on many more of their worlds in the following decades. By -100, the Sylean Federation had acquired all the systems to trailing of Ye-lu. Finally, in the year -1, the exhausted forces of the remaining Confederacy worlds surrendered to the Sylean Federation. That it took almost another century after the fall of Velpare for the Confederacy to completely collapse is a testament to its then superior technology and the obstinacy of its worlds.

The artefacts and culture of the Interstellar Confederacy live on in current times. The former Confederacy worlds of Bunkeria and Cemplas proudly celebrate their history and its famous personalities. Perhaps the greatest living remnant of the Confederacy is the Achenaar Antilles Line, a merchant firm founded on F’rnow in -567 by Rualto Achenaar and Jofan Antilles. In modern times, the corporation remains a highly successful sector-wide line, which has fared well against larger competitors.

# The Chanestin Kingdom

When the Long Night fell, travel between star systems came to a halt throughout most of civilised space. Many worlds died out if they could not sustain themselves without the benefit of interstellar trade. Self-sufficient worlds were often able to survive. With its placid K-type main sequence primary star, standard atmosphere and bountiful resources, Keshi was one such place.

Keshi was a rich agricultural world during the era of the Ziru Sirka and was heavily colonized by the Solomani after the Interstellar Wars. After the Rule of Man collapsed, Keshi retained a fleet of starships and huge stockpiles of materiel, which helped it to fare better than its neighbors. In the year -1300, Keshi was ruled by King Brzeszcze, who used his aging fleet of starships to conquer the systems around him. After several generations, the Chanestin Kingdom had amassed an empire of 25 worlds, all of which were within five parsecs of Keshi. Once conquered, these worlds were not excessively oppressed unless they resisted the authority of the King.

Even as it grew increasingly incapable of maintaining its fleet of starships, the Chanestin Kingdom managed to govern its empire for over 1,000 years before being contacted by outsiders. Unlike the Interstellar Confederacy, the Chanestin people were not plagued by divisiveness but likewise they were not blessed with the Confederacy’s advanced technology.

The Sylean Federation established contact with Chanestin Kingdom border worlds in -108 and followed up by sending a flotilla of merchant ships in -107 to establish trade ties. The ruling monarch, Queen Nayarit, accepted the cargoes that the merchants brought with them but had the entire expedition executed for inciting its people with seditious ideas. The Sylean Federation responded by sending warships and a war broke out between the two polities that lasted nearly a century.

By the time the Syleans had contacted them, the highest available technology on the Chanestin worlds was TL9 and they had been reduced to a single operating jump-capable starship. Unfortunately for the Syleans, they had inadvertently given the Chanestin the tools needed to revive their ailing navy. The Chanestin kept the starships of the merchants whom they had executed, armed the stolen ships and put them into service as their own. They also reverse engineered the technology to begin the arduous task of building a new fleet of warships. The Chanestin Kingdom recognized the Sylean Federation for the existential threat that it was and invested every iota of their energy into the preservation of their millennium-old empire.  ithin a few short years, they had the makings of a fleet and went on the offensive against the Syleans.

After exhausting themselves in a war that lasted 63 years, the two sides signed an armistice in -44 to prevent further bloodshed but by -25, the Kingdom realised that their technology was becoming increasingly inferior to that of the Syleans and they grew desperate. Chanestin naval forces launched a series of deep attacks into Sylean space, including one that made it all the way to Shudushaam. In -3, the Sylean Federation had resolved to call upon its full military might in the conflict and finally defeated the Chanestin Kingdom two years after the declaration of the Third Imperium.

The feudal structure of the Chanestin Kingdom was nullified and cooperative members of its nobility were offered Imperial noble patents to placate them.The once-proud Kingdom was  ntegrated into the Imperium and so began a painful, centuries-long period of cultural and economic decline for their once-proud worlds.
![[TImp-6170.jpg]][[TImp-6170.jpg|HISTORICAL MAP OF THE CHANESTIN KINGDOM]]

While the conflict with the Interstellar Confederacy might best have been described as a war of attrition, the war with the Chanestin Kingdom presented a very different challenge for the Syleans. The Chanestin were much more unified. The Syleans learned valuable lessons in both conflicts, which would fuel their later military endeavors.

Despite the problems encountered in the Core, the Sylean Federation did not stand by idly patrolling their own sector during this era. Federation scouts were sent in all directions to re-establish contact with other worlds and pocket empires that had weathered the Long Night. During the last century of Federation rule, its scouts had extended Sylea’s reach 30–40 parsecs in all directions. The corridor to Vland, now called the Annililik Run, was a long and dangerous route, used by only the boldest of traders. Piracy plagued all of the major trade routes, a problem which would soon expose the Sylean Federation’s weaknesses.

While it had yet to develop a supporting bureaucracy or official structure, the prototype of the modern scout service began to surface in approximately -100; previously, most scouting was performed by freelancers and entrepreneurial ventures. Scout crews were given contracts by the Federation government and various corporations for the information they obtained.

Some crews focused strictly on data collection; surveying territory, updating maps and recontacting lost civilizations. Others worked the commercial side, seeking natural resources to exploit, trade partners for Sylean corporations and scoping out future industrial sites. The two sides would not come together until a few decades later in -29 when President Cleon Zhunastu declared the formation of the Sylean Federation Scout Service (SFSS). The service was divided into four branches: Administration, Technical Services, Operations and Exploration. The SFSS was the precursor of the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service, which was formed in year 0 of the Third Imperium.

The SFSS had a short tenure before being replaced by the IISS but the timing could not have been better for its replacement. The marriage of exploratory and mercantile services was not a happy one. The SFSS was plagued by corruption and scandal for most of its three decades. Too many special interests had gotten involved in the planning of missions. Far too often the data and security needs of the Federation took a back seat to the desires of corporations with deep pockets. Missions of a purely exploratory nature were postponed if there were possible trade ties to be had in a different region. When the IISS was formed, commercial interests were struck from the Scout Service’s list of responsibilities and handed over to individual corporations.

> [!QUOTE] The Day They Arrived
> When the first ship appeared in the sky, the people of Port Khanuum could tell there was something different about it. Our world, Kirbarus, had been raided by pirates from somewhere in Massilia many times but the fishermen setting sail could tell at first glance that this was no pirate ship. It was sleek, colourful, well-maintained and shiny. Pirate ships were always barely holding up, with their dull, scarred hulls and engines sputtering as they came in to exact their toll from us. With few defensive weapons of our own, the laser turrets on a pirate ship could be applied with devastating results like lightning bolts hurled down upon us from a spiteful god.

> No, this ship was different. It landed on the flat plains just outside the city near the marsh, taking care to avoid damaging crops in the fields. The crew wore uniforms and came out unarmed, filter masks protecting them from our atmospheric taint. They walked the two kilometres from the field to the town centre where they asked to speak to Port Khanuum’s leaders. They brought gifts with them: portable fusion power cells that could provide enough energy for an entire province. We had returned to using fossil fuels with a few nuclear fission plants on the coast of the southern continent. Only in textbooks did our young students learn about a forgotten age of fusion power and the spacecraft that once connected worlds with their ability to jump from star-to-star. We were among the lucky worlds with a semi-breathable atmosphere, genetically engineered crops and enough people to work the land. Most of our resources were applied to filtering out contaminants in our water and eliminating pests that threatened our crops.
>
> Before too long we were reunited with the star systems around us, our agricultural goods shipped from world-to-world, helping to revive struggling populations and resurrecting those whose colonies had completely died out after the Rule of Man ended. The profits we made from selling produce and other wares were used to purchase freighters of our own. We felt like we were waking up from a 1,000-year-long dream. Soon we proudly called ourselves members of the Sylean Federation. Our world was forever changed the day they arrived.

# Cleon Zhunastu

As the Federation extended its reach to 30 or so parsecs in all directions from Sylea, acquiring an increasing number of member systems, the strain of interstellar government began to show. Just as it was  for the Federation’s much larger predecessors, it was becoming clear that centralised governments were poor at managing large expanses of space. The limiting factor was the reach of the jump drive, just as it had always been. Information was limited to the speed of jump, which made it impossible to govern from any distance beyond a few parsecs.

The Sylean Federation had achieved a uniform TL11 and its industries were rapidly pushing towards TL12. Jump-2 was the standard for Sylean military ships with a smattering of jump-3 prototype spacecraft in operation. Decisions made by the Grand Senate were carried by fast couriers but by the time their instructions reached the frontier, circumstances had often changed. This made dealing with the piracy crisis increasingly difficult. The Federation was built upon the concept of establishing free trade between member worlds but rampant piracy threatened to destroy everything they had built. The Federation had built an impressive navy but there simply were not enough squadrons to defend worlds that were more than a few parsecs from Sylea. Arguments between the Democrats and Expansionists paralysed the Grand Senate. Several presidents were deposed for their failure to handle the problem. It was clear that something had to be done but no one in a position of leadership was willing to make big changes until Cleon Zhunastu came along.

Cleon was born to a noble father, Grand Duke Felix Zhunastu of Sylea and his Vilani consort, Denkhumi. The Zhunastu family were exorbitantly wealthy, having achieved great success in the fields of energy production and spacecraft manufacturing. Cleon’s Uncle Aldin was an ingenious engineer in the field of fusion energy systems. Fusion power plants had existed before the Long Night but most worlds had lost the ability to manufacture them. Aldin’s patented designs improved upon existing fusion technology and were implemented in a line of products called Fusion Plus (F+). F+ plants were small, tidy and energy efficient, easily transportable for sale and installation in distant star systems.

As the Grand Duke of Sylea, Felix Zhunastu dreamed that the Sylean Federation would one day become an enormous trade empire, one which would create wealth for all of its citizens. Felix’s hands were tied by politics during his reign but he could foresee a time when that would change. He groomed Cleon to be ready for that day and set plans in motion that would ensure his legacy. Felix manipulated the Grand Senate to grant the president broad and expansive powers and used the Zhunastu family fortune to acquire several key corporations that he merged into a single corporate entity: Zhunastu Industries.

> [!INFO]- SECRETS OF THE ZHUNASTU DYNASTY
> The ageless story of the Zhunastu dynasty has transcended into the realm of myth. There is little doubt that the family was a talented bunch but some aspects of their story are shrouded in mystery.
>
> They became the masters of the Sylean Federation, yet had little if any Sylean blood in their heritage. They used technology to overcome their rivals, yet for a time they were not even the most technologically advanced empire in their own sector. The Zhunastus had an uncanny ability to overcome every obstacle in their path with a clear and methodical approach. They were undeterred by setbacks and always seemed prepared with a contingency plan when things went awry. Many historians believe that they used two tools to overcome challenges that got in their way: psychohistory and psionics.
>
> Felix Zhunastu had long been a disciple of psychohistory, the use of mathematics to predict the mass movements and future history of Humaniti. The larger the sampling, the better psychohistory works, or so goes the conventional wisdom. Vilani psychohistorians predicted the long, drawn-out fall of the Ziru Sirka. Solomani psychohistorians saw the demise of the Rule of Man coming like a high-speed freight train. These were enormous empires with populations in the trillions. The Sylean Federation was a tiny polity in comparison, yet its leaders increasingly leaned on psychohistory as their empire grew in size and population. This was at least one of the reasons for the Syleans’ eagerness to reunite with Vland. By reconnecting with the capital of the old empire, the Syleans increased their sample size immensely, making psychohistorical predictions much more accurate. By the time Cleon took the role of Grand Duke upon his father’s death, the Federation and its allies had achieved a certain critical mass, providing an increasing level of clarity and accuracy in their psychohistorical predictions.
>
> While there is no direct proof, most believe that the Zhunastus also employed psions in key roles of their political and corporate organizations. There is little reason to believe the Zhunastus themselves had psionic talent but both Sylea and Rhylea (then called Udmum) hosted reputable psionic clubs and university programmes. The top psionic talents of the era were recruited by the noble families to serve as aides and spies. There were laws preventing unlawful telepathic and clairvoyant intrusion, which necessitated the development of counter-psionics: psions trained to detect and prosecute violations. Psionics gave the nobility and corporate community unprecedented advantages over their competition. Rumor has it that the Zhunastus even had a precog on their payroll, a rare talent indeed.

In -32 Cleon returned from a long journey during which he had visited Antares, Amdukan and finally Vland, where he stayed for over a year to study at the Argushiigi Admegulasha Bilanidin (AAB), the Vilani ‘repository of all knowledge’. In a public statement, Cleon expressed admiration for the world’s history and customs. While studying at the AAB, he published a dissertation: ‘The Vilani Imperative: Lessons of the Shudusham Concords’. Within the Core sector in the year -112, terrorists detonated a bomb on a courier robot that killed the premier of Fornol and several Sylean nobles while aboard the Empire’s Banner , a Sylean warship. The incident nearly caused a civil war. Cleon’s scholarly paper hypothesised that the Shudusham Concords, which limited the use of weaponry on robots, were evidence of the enduring Vilani legacy in the modern Core. Cautious and limited use of technology were tenets of Vilani philosophy and Cleon won his hosts over with a spirited statement of their shared heritage.

Felix Zhunastu died in -30, leaving a young but wise-beyond-his-years Cleon as his heir. Cleon assumed the mantle of Grand Duke, president of the Grand Senate and chairman of Zhunastu Industries at the tender age of 27. He did not waste time making his mark.

Cleon kept a close eye on the family business but appointed his Uncle Aldin as chief executive officer to perform the day-to-day management of the company. During Cleon’s first year as president of the Grand Senate, the Syleans began to actively recruit more worlds to the Federation. The recruitment drive was anchored by Vland, which committed its worlds. Stronger diplomatic and trade ties between Sylea and Vland had been developing for centuries and Cleon’s presence and scholarly work at the AAB was the decisive factor in the Vilani decision to join. In a public statement on Sylea, Cleon expressed his gratitude for their trust and vowed to leave Vilani social institutions intact. The union of the Sylean and Vilani polities was a coup of major proportions. It conveyed the inevitability of the growing Sylean trade federation, served as a valuable recruiting tool and gave the citizens of the Federation the sense that they were a part of something much bigger than themselves.

Not content to sit on his laurels, Cleon became the renaissance man of his times, engaging in politics, business and diplomacy with equal verve. One of his first acts was to reform the Scout Service. While the agency had been one of the linchpins of the expansion effort, noble and corporate influence had corrupted it. Instead of extending the reach of the Federation, it had become a tool of the wealthy. High-ranking nobles and business leaders were effectively selecting the Scout Service’s missions and sanctioning only those which served their narrow business interests. While developing trade routes was certainly a key goal, Cleon felt that the Scout Service must be focused on survey and exploration for their own sake and set up a bureaucracy to give the agency independence. This would be the first of many reforms that helped the Scout Service become the institution that it is in modern times.

A big test for the growing Sylean Federation was solving the piracy crisis. Piracy had become an epidemic, hindering the growth of the Federation and threatening its membership drive. Zhunastu Industries built a squadron of light carriers and sublight gunships, fitted them with F+ plants and sent them to the frontier. They struck a major blow at the Azimuth system where they destroyed a particularly notorious pirate. While the destruction of one pirate ship did not end the crisis, it was a major public relations victory for the Federation. It gave the frontier worlds the confidence that the Federation was going to help them.

Cleon’s actions during the pre-Imperial era were often maddening to his peers. One week he would be working on diplomatic relations with the monarch of Adguu Uun, the next he would be off to Nimluin to be present for Zhunastu Industries’ latest factory opening and then back to Capital to discuss the future of the Federation. Historical records of the era make him appear to be a madman but when one steps back to look at the big picture, it was almost as if Cleon already knew what would happen in the year 0, the year that the Third Imperium was founded.

Obviously, Cleon was just one man and there was only so much he could do. Over time, he learned to delegate authority to women and men whom he deemed trustworthy, dutiful and honorable, characteristics that he looked for in others throughout his life. Cleon had a vision that he was striving towards with single-minded focus and sought others who shared his dream to build a great and lasting empire.

![[TImp-6297.jpg|200]]

# Year 0

Cleon spent the last years of the Sylean Federation building and consolidating power. He established allegiances with trusted corporate executives and members of the nobility. The SFSS continued to extend the Federation’s reach and Zhunastu Industries peddled F+ technology to member and satellite worlds in an effort to draw them into the fold. On Sylea, those who worked with Cleon saw their fortunes grow immensely. GSbAG, which had long held a favourable relationship with the Zhunastus, became the Federation’s primary military contractor, building warships for the growing navy and freighters for its expanding merchant lines.

Cleon broke ground on the first Grand Palace of the Imperium. The project was completed in two years. It was an ugly building that looked more like a fortress than a stately manor but this was intentional. Its pyramidal structure and few entrances were designed to make it easier to defend should it come under siege. The palace and its Emperor would have to survive the tumultuous early years of a new empire. Cleon was leery of leaks and initially coy about the exact nature of his grand plans. Only a select group of close confidantes knew the whole picture. The Sylean Federation was going big. Imperial scouts had by this time encountered dozens of pocket empires. Cleon foresaw a future in which there was a place for all of them under the umbrella of a new and powerful empire, one which transcended all that had come before.

Cleon’s final act as president and Grand Duke of Sylea was to issue the Warrant for the Restoration of the Imperium. This document declared that the Sylean Federation and its associated worlds would transform into the Third Imperium on the first day of the following year. The warrant claimed that the Third Imperium would one day include all worlds that had once been under the Ziru Sirka and Rule of Man. Precedence, tradition and history would guide the hand of this new Imperium in its quest to restore civilization to Charted Space.

The Warrant for Restoration did not meet with universal approval. For 650 years, the power structure of the Sylean Federation had calcified. Not everyone was so keen to give it up. Thirteen of the worlds closest to Sylea initially rejected the warrant. Cleon and his closest supporters worked vehemently to gain their support and within a few months had brought five of the 13 back into the fold. Shortly after the founding of the Third Imperium three of these worlds flip-flopped once again and nullified their Imperial memberships. These systems became known as the Wayward Worlds. Fortunately for Cleon he still had the votes in the Grand Senate to carry out his plan, if only barely. On the last day of the 650th year of the Sylean Federation, the Grand Senate ratified the Warrant for Restoration and declared Cleon the first Emperor of the Third Imperium. He was crowned Cleon I on the first day of Imperial year 0 and Sylea was renamed Capital. No longer was it just the provincial capital of a pocket empire. Capital aspired to become the centre of the greatest interstellar empire in human history.

The Emperor of the Third Imperium was given sweeping powers, far more than the leader of Sylea’s Grand Senate or its president and a feudal nobility was established that would become an extension of the Emperor’s will. Members of the nobility were granted patents that established their titles. Many would be granted fiefs to administer. Nobles would serve at the Emperor’s leisure and could have their patents revoked if they did not perform to expectations.

The Grand Senate was dissolved and replaced by the Imperial Moot, a deliberative body composed of the appointed nobles. The Moot was given two powers: the ability to confirm the ascendance of a new Emperor and dissolve the Imperium. Many of its members were former Senators. Others were corporate officers, military leaders and other esteemed individuals who proved their loyalty and commitment to the new Imperium. Provisional fiefs were assigned to the new nobility. These would be altered and consolidated in the months and years ahead as the Imperium took shape.

The Moot convened on Capital in state offices separate from the Imperial Grand Palace. In addition to its primary powers, the Moot served in an advisory role to the Emperor. A senior member of the Moot was selected to serve as Chancellor. This position had special privileges and access to the Emperor. A primary facet of the new Imperium was that its high nobles – primarily its dukes and eventually its archdukes – would have broad powers and oversight over their respective regions. The previous human empires fell because they became too large to manage. The Third Imperium sought to address this shortcoming by sharing the responsibility with a trusted hierarchy of noble bureaucrats.

The Imperial Guard was formed to protect the Emperor on Capital. At first its only regiment was the Sylean Guard but many more regiments would be added over time. The Federation Navy became the Imperial Navy, whose role was to defend the space between worlds and enforce Imperial law. The Imperial Marines were established, the powerful shipborne assault force of the navy. Articles were drafted for the creation of an Imperial Army as well. This would require a sea change in military thinking. Previously the armies of Federation worlds were independent entities. The armies of Imperial worlds would retain some degree of independence but they would engage in joint training exercises, observe certain uniform and equipment standards and share strategic objectives.

The SFSS became the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service (IISS). The organization was still in flux in the early years of Imperial rule. With corporate and noble influences effectively rooted out, the IISS became a neutral arm of the Imperial government. The branches that were most corrupted – Operations and Administration – were defunded, leaving the less political Exploration and Technical Services branches intact but now bereft of an administrative umbrella and therefore responsible for their own administration. The new IISS had essentially cut off its diseased appendages, leaving only those in place whose motives were deemed to be pure. Members of Operations and Administration who had acquitted themselves honorably were given new roles in the pared down, more efficient service. These changes had an extreme effect on scout culture. A flat, less stratified structure began to take shape, one in which even the lowliest scout had a voice. The flat structure of the Scout Service would soon be reflected in its fleet of starships as well. The venerable _Iiken_ -class scout/courier was adopted as the ship of choice, a small, durable, multi-faceted and most of all economical spacecraft that could be operated by a light crew (one individual if necessary) and which could perform most of the jobs the scouts needed done: communications, survey and exploration. The wedge-shaped design of the ship had withstood the test of time, dating back to the era of the Ziru Sirka. The modern Type-S scout/courier uses a nearly identical form factor with subtle changes.

# The Fledgling Imperium

At the dawn of the Third Imperium, its territory included most of the Core and Vland sectors with islands of independence throughout but Cleon had set his sights on a far greater empire. Despite the fact that upon its birth the Imperium was effectively at war – the conflict with the Chanestin Kingdom was in its final throes and the rebellious Santry Cluster was being pacified by the Imperial Marines – it never wavered from its designs upon all of the territory formerly held by the Ziru Sirka and Rule of Man.

Having such lofty aspirations is commendable but actually achieving them another thing altogether. Cleon’s method was to kill them with kindness. After the residents of each world were contacted – by the scouts or otherwise – Imperial merchants would attempt to trade with them in order to show the value that the Imperium could bring to their lives. If they consented to join, they were promised the whole package: free trade, defense by the Imperial Navy, assignment of a noble to serve as an intermediary and so on. If they balked, the Imperium would simply move on to the next world and leave the ungrateful ones in the dust. Cleon believed that most worlds would join up and those that did not would eventually come to their senses. What he did not count on was how much patience it would require to see this process through.

The early years of the nascent empire were marked by the second great expansion and an attempt to consolidate territory already held. The effort to draw the more reluctant worlds into the fold would require an impressive value proposition, visible evidence that joining the Imperium was worthwhile. Like any new venture, it would take time to show a profit. Planetary rulers had to understand that there might not be a big payoff during their lifetimes. The reward would be to see the explosive growth of the empire and a future made bright by burgeoning trade. Cleon spent most of his time on Capital during this era, justifying the existence of the Imperium to a divided Moot and carefully cultivating his political relationships. The success of this monumental venture was by no means a certainty at this point. The forces stacked against it were considerable, some of which were banal and others more nefarious. Worlds that had been bypassed and yet committed to the Imperium represented a subtle if persistent threat.

A constant battle that Cleon had to fight with the Imperial court was a tendency towards conservatism in the worlds close to Capital. As the space between the Core worlds became increasingly safe and its trade routes more lucrative, there was less of a desire to take chances lest they ‘tip the apple cart’. The only way Cleon could combat this tendency was by extending Imperial borders ever outward.

By the year 20, the Imperium encompassed a good portion of the Antares, Dagudashaag, Ilelish and Massilia sectors, adding to the wide swath of stars it had already acquired along the path to Vland. The membership of the Moot was expanded to incorporate the new barons, marquises, counts and dukes assigned to these territories. Local administrative control was given to new members of the peerage, providing an acid test for the Emperor’s distributed management model.

Pirates and reavers still roamed much of Imperial space, especially along the frontier, but regional control of naval forces made it possible to squelch malcontents quickly and efficiently. It would be an exaggeration to say that trade flourished in the frontiers immediately thereafter but it became increasingly apparent that it would over time. They had only to look at the Core worlds to see the proof. The Wayward Worlds and their ilk began to see the signs of progress passing them by at jump speed. Traders who had established connections to the Imperium’s growing system of links and branches were the first to reap the benefits of Imperial expansion. Many of the worlds that had resisted joining thus far came to their senses and applied for membership.

With a growing number of worlds joining the Imperium, Emperor Cleon declared in the year 17 that Imperial citizenship would be granted to all sophonts within Imperial borders, not just humans. There is some debate among academics about the timing of Cleon’s declaration. Scouts had begun to make contact with worlds as far as the Ley and Gateway sectors, and there were rumors of missions to the uncharted territories across the Great Rift and recontact with Mother Terra to rimward. With so many distant regions being integrated into the Imperium, most historians believe the declaration was simply a hearty welcome to any and all alien species who were being asked to join. To a great extent this was certainly true. However, there is a movement among academia who also believe it was a harbinger of what was to come. As an avid practitioner of psychohistory, Cleon may well have foreseen the difficulties that would arise with the incorporation of Antares, in part because the culture of the region included Vargr. Cleon could have made the Declaration of 17 with the Vargr of Antares in mind, whom he hoped to recruit along with their human cohorts.

While Cleon never did take a wife, he did produce an heir with his consort, Medi Ahn Thon, a woman of mostly Sylean heritage whose family were wealthy industrialists from Zimiin (now Knabbib). His son, who would one day take the crown as Cleon II, was born in the year 21 and was Cleon’s only offspring. Unlike his father Felix before him, Cleon the elder did little to apprentice his son for the leadership role that he would eventually be asked to take. He left the boy’s education in the hands of his tutors and university professors. Bereft of a strong father figure, young Cleon turned to Artemsus Lentuli, Chancellor of the Moot and his father’s most trusted advisor. Artemsus was the son of Djugashvili Lentuli, who had served as Cleon’s intelligence chief in the first years of the Imperium. The younger Lentuli had already lived an eventful life and was famous for helping to fight off a pirate attack on one of his family’s ships at the age of  17. He went on to have a distinguished career in the newly created Imperial Navy, followed by a stint as a diplomat for the Moot.

As Chancellor, Artemsus sought to integrate the worlds that had thus far resisted incorporation into the Imperium. He coined the term ‘Quarantine Worlds’, likening them to viruses or parasites, which must either be treated or cut off from the interstellar community of the Imperium. Quarantine Worlds reaped the benefits of membership in the Imperium without paying taxes or contributing to its defense. Artemsus claimed that the Warrant for the Restoration of the Imperium justified his actions. He employed the Imperial bureaucracy (a.k.a., the nobility) as his agents to draw Quarantine Worlds into the fold with diplomacy where possible but with force if necessary.

With the dream of the Third Imperium in only its nascent stages, Cleon I died in the year 53. His son was crowned Cleon II but quickly decided that he was unfit for the role. After an ignominious year on the throne, during which he became known as ‘Cleon the Weak’, he abdicated without an heir, expressing his preference that his highly capable Chancellor should become Emperor. The brief but eventful Zhunastu Dynasty had come to an end – for now – to be succeeded by the first of the Lentuli Line. As for young Cleon, he continued to serve the Imperium faithfully, spending a great deal of time on the frontier where he helped Artemsus to integrate Quarantine Worlds.

# The Pacification Campaigns and the Spinward Frontier

Once crowned, Artemsus adopted a decidedly more aggressive approach to realising the Warrant for Restoration. He initiated the Pacification Campaigns, a massive effort to integrate the Quarantine Worlds and all of the worlds that had been held by the previous empires. In preparation, Artemsus divided the Imperium into five domains: Sylea, Antares, Vland, Ilelish and Gateway. In each domain except Sylea, he appointed an archduke from the ranks of the subsector dukes. The archduke of the Domain of Sylea was also the Emperor. Each of these archdukes was responsible for the integration of their respective Quarantine Worlds and inclusion of historically held regions of space. As Archduke of Sylea, Artemsus led by example.

![[TImp-6302.jpg]]

## THE PACIFICATION CAMPAIGNS

The Pacification Campaigns were the first great test of the Third Imperium’s approach to government. The archdukes were given broad powers to ‘pacify’ their worlds. Unlike the traditional approach used by the Vilani bureaux or the chaotic management style of the Rule of Man, Artemsus’ archdukes were given clear guidelines and then told to get the job done. They were not forced to wait for a central authority figure to tell them what to do each step of the way. The archdukes’ methods met with varying results.

The guidelines that the archdukes were given encouraged multiple levels of diplomacy before considering the use of military force. Firstly, they were to present the benefits of Imperial membership with the implication that joining was not really a choice; it was required. If there was resistance, they were to seek out sympathetic members of the population, arm them and encourage them to rise up in revolution. Should the locals fail in this capacity, directed coups and assassinations were to be considered. If all of the above failed the full military power of the Imperium might then be brought to bear. Ultimately the Emperor would brook no dissent. One way or another, the Quarantine Worlds and the regions claimed by the Warrant for Restoration _would_ be integrated... whether they liked it or not.

The Archduke of Gateway was exempted from the Pacification Campaigns. While their day would certainly come, Gateway was simply too recently settled and unruly for any attempt at pacification to be successful. Even so, the archduke managed to get himself killed in battle with the Luriani, an amphibian human Minor Race based in Ley Sector. The Luriani were subsequently pacified but did not join the Imperium until 202.

The Emperor had yet to appoint an Archduke of Sol but plans to do so were in the offing. By the year 100- about halfway through the Pacification Campaigns- Imperial scouts were making first contact with the worlds of the Solomani Rim. They discovered that the sector had five powerful pocket empires: the Arcturus Federation, the Easter Concord, the Vegan Polity, the Dingir League and the Old Earth Union. A softer touch would be required to draw the Solomani Rim into the Imperium, one which Artemsus himself would devise. Gaining the favour of such a well-established region of space would require a longer game to be played.

## THE ANTARES CAMPAIGN

Conquering the Quarantine Worlds of Lishun and Antares was difficult due to the proximity of the Vargr Extents. Quarantines and blockades were routinely flouted by the Vargr who supplied resistant human worlds with virtually whatever they needed. Whatever the Vargr could not provide from the Extents, they obtained by pirating Imperial merchant ships and then fenced the stolen goods at a premium on the Quarantine Worlds. After decades of frustration, the Imperium went to war in these sectors, conquering the pockets of resistance in Lishun during the early 80s but meeting with stiff resistance in Antares. With some difficulty, the Imperial military conquered the rimward portion of the sector including the much sought-after Antares Cluster. Despite the territorial gains it had made, the Antares Campaigns were considered to be an abject failure. The inability to establish a firm grasp on Lishun and Antares prevented the Imperium from obtaining a beachhead from which it could conquer the Windhorn, Meshan, Mendan and Amdukan sectors, each of which had been partially or entirely in the possession of the Ziru Sirka.

## THE ILELISH CAMPAIGN

The Archduke of Ilelish had a remarkably easy job to do during the Pacification Campaigns; most of the worlds in the domain were amenable to integration. Ilelish (the system) was the homeworld of the Suerrat, a human Minor Race that had established an independent empire using sublight gravitic drives before being gifted jump technology by the Vilani. The sector population was approximately 60 percent Suerrat at the time of the campaigns. Ilelish had many pocket empires of various sizes and Tech Levels that recognized the benefits of Imperial membership. Many of these worlds had fond historical memories of the Rule of Man and eagerly welcomed the return of a broad interstellar power with all the benefits it entailed. Furthermore, Ilelish had begun to realise the threat posed by the burgeoning Aslan Hierate to spinward and sought the aid of the Imperial Navy to defend its borders. Ironically, Ilelish would be the source of a great deal of strife for the Imperium in the following centuries but at this time they were happy to become a part of it.

## THE VILANI CAMPAIGN

Archduke Lukgirigaasa of Vland easily integrated most of the Dagudashaag sector, much of which already benefited from Imperial largesse. The trade corridor developed between Sylea and Vland in the previous centuries had already touched many of the sector’s worlds and slowly drawn them into the fold over time. Any worlds that continued to resist Imperial authority were given simple demonstrations of the benefits of membership followed by equally convincing demonstrations of the military force that could be brought to bear should they decline. Archduke Lukgirigaasa, it appeared, was quite good at demonstrations of force but proven to be sorely lacking when actually called upon to use it. The Imperium met stiff resistance in the spinward portion of the sector and in neighboring Gushemege where the Lancian culture held sway. Most of the inhabitants of this region had little knowledge of the state of affairs outside their realm and had built a modest interstellar empire of their own. The Lancians resisted integration and marshalled enough forces to rout Imperial squadrons during the Battle of Aakgar. When word got to Artemsus, he retired Lukgirigaasa, replacing him with the dour Archduke Im Derisumir whose years of conflict with the Vargr on the coreward frontier of Vland had steeled him to the realities of war. In typical Vilani fashion, the new archduke regrouped, reinforced his fleets and retaliated with brutal efficiency. The Lancians were brought into the Imperium by force. Stiff pockets of resistance were eradicated with orbital bombardments, cleansing many worlds of their entire populations. Despite the extreme methods employed, the end result was the full integration of all worlds in the domain.

## THE SYLEAN CAMPAIGN

The archduke of the Domain of Sylea is also the Emperor, so Artemsus himself was responsible for the pacification and integration of Core, Fornast and Delphi. As the architect of the Pacification Campaigns, Artemsus brought the full range of Imperial powers to bear upon these worlds with great success. Artemsus used diplomacy wherever possible but quickly accelerated the methods used to inciting coups d’état and revolutions, establishing blockades, threatening orbital bombardment and – when necessary – invading and occupying. Core was entirely integrated into the Third Imperium by the year 111 and significant portions of Fornast and Delphi were acquired as well. It was crucial to the future of the Imperium that the Emperor’s own domain be effectively pacified and Artemsus made certain that it was. A further goal of the Sylean Campaign was to pacify the worlds of Massilia but it would be centuries before that sector was fully integrated.

The Pacification Campaigns were not met with universal praise. There were many who dissented, some of whom were members of the Moot. The most famous of these was Zuan Kerr, the statesman who had almost single-handedly brought the hostile Ershur subsector in Massilia into the Imperium by going to its worlds, living among its people and cultivating diplomatic ties with them. Kerr opposed the use of force as a method of coercion, preferring instead the peaceful approach that had been fostered by Cleon I. Alas, Kerr died in 67, paving the way for Artemsus’ campaigns to begin. It was a testament to Kerr’s influence that it took Artemsus another decade to win the Moot over. However, following the violence of the Pacification Campaigns, Kerr would again become a pivotal figure, even posthumously, among those who did not wish to see the Imperium take the path of a belligerent conqueror. Kerr’s erudite pleas against the injudicious use of violence changed the way the Imperium approached conflicts.

While Artemsus was in the process of executing the Pacification Campaigns, he never took his attention from the goal of continued expansion. By any means possible, Artemsus intended to prosecute the Warrant for Restoration. The failure of the Antares Campaign to integrate the coreward sectors of the First Imperium was a public relations disaster. Fortunately for Artemsus, he had another advantage.

Just as the Pacification Campaigns had begun, several expeditions had made their way through the Great Rift into Deneb and what would one day be called the Spinward Marches. Previous attempts to gain entry to the region via the coreward portion of Corridor met with disaster for various reasons, not least of which were plundering Vargr corsairs. More successful attempts were made by crossing the Rift via Ishirdu. The Great Rift was a vast obstacle to expansion into the region, but innovation and persistence on the part of the explorers made it happen. In the year 60, an expedition funded by the megacorporation Ling Standard Products established a colony on Mora from which dozens of other colonial expeditions would spring.

The Emperor was eager to get the IISS involved and sent several scout fleets across the Rift, each of which contained 10 or more of the Scout Service’s Iiken -class scout/couriers. Just as in the days of old, when the Ziru Sirka was expanding its borders, these ships travelled far and wide, collecting survey data of the entire region that would one day become the Domain of Deneb. To celebrate their heroic efforts, Emperor Artemsus founded the Order of the Arrow in 62, which was only open to distinguished members of the Scout Service.

The scouts and other intrepid explorers who crossed the Rift discovered that Deneb and the Spinward Marches were largely uninhabited but not all of its worlds were virgin territory. There were several interstellar polities already there, including the Sword Worlds, Darrian Confederation and Zhodani Consulate. There were records of the latter but it had been thousands of years since they had last been contacted. By 75, Imperial scouts, colonial expeditions and corporate-sponsored enterprises had expanded deep into the Marches and established a colony on Regina. Early expeditions also discovered isolated civilizations on many individual worlds, including dozens in the Trojan Reach that had once been members of the highly advanced Sindalian Empire, which had imploded in an apocalyptic civil war during the Long Night.

The stories out of Deneb were a welcome distraction from the failures of the Antares Pacification Campaign. If the new Imperium could not acquire all of the sectors claimed by the Warrant of Restoration, at least it was in the process of trailblazing a new and largely uninhabited region of space. The Domain of Deneb captured the imaginations of the citizens of the Imperium. The notion that there were uncharted worlds to spinward being made ready for expansion gave people hope for the future.

For a time, the two narratives ran concurrently. On one side, the Imperium was assiduously working to reacquire all systems held by the previous empires, however unrealistic that goal may have been. On the other, the Imperium explored new worlds, reinventing itself and becoming something entirely new. It was time for things to change. Artemsus abruptly called an end to the Pacification Campaigns in the year 120.

# Terra Mater

Scarcely noticed during all the hubbub of the times, a noble by the name of Magis Sergei haut-Devroe completed an extensive research project on the origins of Humaniti. One of the great mysteries of Charted Space was the seemingly simultaneous appearance of human species on dozens of worlds. Haut-Devroe travelled extensively throughout the Imperium, performing exhaustive research of the fossil records of many worlds and examined Humaniti’s place in their respective ecosystems. After eliminating Urunishu in Antares as a candidate, it became clear to haut-Devroe and his team that Terra was clearly the homeworld of all human species. He published The Solomani Hypothesis: The True Origin of Mankind on Kaggushus in the Massilia sector in 102, perhaps expecting to rock the foundations of the galaxy. Instead, his monumental discovery was initially ignored and later met with tepid acceptance when it was presented to the broader audience of the Imperium in 114. To be fair, it was not the first time Terra had been suggested as the origin world of Humaniti. The Terrans themselves presented convincing evidence during the Rule of Man; however, the ubiquity of the Vilani and racial pride of the 40 or so other human races prevented universal acceptance.

Haut-Devroe proposed that a mysterious alien race called the Ancients took human and canine samples from Terra in approximately -300,000, genetically engineered many of them and seeded them among the worlds of Charted Space. The disappearance of the Ancients was a mystery to researchers who ascertained they had destroyed themselves in an enormous Final War, although the disposition of the winners was never determined. Researchers theorised they may have gone extinct or left Charted Space. The Ancients disappeared from the galactic scene in approximately -290,000, leaving only ruins and altered races behind.

Despite the nonchalance with which the Solomani Hypothesis was received, Emperor Artemsus took it very seriously. The IISS had only recently recontacted the empires of the Solomani Rim and it was readily apparent that incorporating the origin sector of Humaniti would not be accomplished by a pacification campaign. The five pocket empires of the Solomani Rim were each powerful in their own right with separate navies, complex political and economic relationships and old cultures that had weathered the Long Night much better than most such states. Each of the four had retained jump technology and were impeded from expanding into the Imperial Core by the much more severe collapse of the worlds coreward of the Rim.

There was some trepidation on Artemsus’ part that if not handled carefully, the Solomani empires could unite in some way before membership in the Imperium was even offered. Many of the worlds of the new Imperium had humans of Solomani descent and might find membership in a competitive Solomani empire more appealing. Artemsus spent the post-Pacification Campaign years letting the dust settle, consolidating commercial relationships with the newly minted member worlds of the Imperium and reaching out across unintegrated territory to begin the process of finding common ground with the Solomani.

Despite acceptance of the Solomani Hypothesis being far from universal, the influence of Solomani nobles in the fledgling Imperium was strong. Many petitioned Artemsus to immediately establish stronger ties with the Solomani Rim and Terra. Artemsus felt it was far too early to bring Terra on board. The Third Imperium was still young and the integration of the alleged homeworld of Humaniti might have disruptive political effects.

Artemsus died in the year 166 at the age of 183, an impressive number for most humans but typical for the Lentuli line. His son succeeded him and was crowned Martin I. Artemsus had been careful not to neglect his son as had Cleon I before him. Martin was fully indoctrinated in his father’s philosophy and strategies for establishing a greater Imperium, perhaps to excess.

# The Julian War

It must have been frustrating for Emperor Martin to have spent his entire life being prepared for the role of Emperor only to have his father live for 183 years. Martin’s destiny was put on hold until he had reached the age of 154. To put that in perspective, Martin had more than a century _after_ retiring from a distinguished military career to think about what he might do as Emperor before being allowed to actually do it. To make matters worse, once Martin finally did pick a fight, about a decade into his reign, he chose a nemesis who deftly outmaneuverd him and proved to be his superior in just about every way.

Martin was obsessed with the failure of the Antares Pacification Campaign. Still smarting after half a century, he was adamant in his belief that a second attempt would succeed where the first had failed. With great effort and a significant expenditure of political and military capital, Martin spurred the Archduke of Antares to launch what became known as the Julian War.

The Julian War had been a long time coming. Julian Menderes, the patriarch of the hallowed Menderes Corporation, was named Regent of the Asimikigir Confederation and rallied the disparate states of Mendan and Amdukan into an alliance that became known as the Julian Protectorate. These disconnected interstellar states found common cause in their desire to repel the Imperium. The Vargr of the region had been slaves to humans for centuries but were given their freedom by the progressive Asimikigir Confederation. Rumors that the Imperium was enslaving and killing Vargr in far-off Corridor motivated the Vargr of Antares to fight them.

After the Pacification Campaigns ended, the Julian Protectorate frustrated and delayed Imperial action for over 50 years. The delaying action gave the Protectorate time to build the Star Legion, a unified defense force whose primary purpose was to fend off the Imperium.

The Imperium launched its first attacks in 175, determined to strike a demoralising blow to the Julian Protectorate early in the conflict. The Imperial Admiralty believed that the Protectorate would be overwhelmed by the sheer power and destructive capabilities that its navy brought to bear. The fleet was organised in two columns, one of which drove towards Lasla in Mendan and the other towards the much more ambitious target of Asimikigir in Amdukan, the capital of Julian Menderes’ state of origin. Within three years, it appeared as if the Imperium had accomplished its goals, with most of Mendan and Amdukan under Imperial control and the Lasla system as its base of operations. The second fleet was driving towards Asimikigir when things took a surprising turn. A Star Legion fleet, reinforced by squadrons from the Vargr Extents pushed back against the Asimikigir offensive, resulting in a period of retrenchment for both sides that lasted until 183.

Just as the Imperium was prepared to resume hostilities, Julian Protectorate and Vargr fleets launched a two-pronged attack of their own, one of which thrust headlong into the Antares and Lishun sectors, lacerating the flank of the Imperial column. The other fleet crossed the Empty Quarter Rift and struck from behind the Imperial fleet into Antares and Ley. The Star Legion destroyed the poorly defended naval depots in both sectors, crippling the Imperium’s chances. The Imperium was forced to retreat in order to defend the gains they had paid for so dearly during the Pacification Campaigns. With memories of the Antares Campaign still fresh in their minds, the worlds of the Antares Cluster revolted against the Imperium and the Star Legion liberated them.

Emperor Martin was forced to sue for peace. The Treaty of Antares was signed in 191, resulting in a significant loss of territory. Powerless to do otherwise, the Imperium granted the League of Antares autonomous status. The Star Legion forces withdrew from Lishun and Ley but the Imperium had lost more than half of the Antares sector. The Imperium withdrew from the region, defeated and demoralised.

Martin failed to anticipate the ability of the Julian Protectorate to draw upon the resources of the Vargr Extents and underestimated the abilities of their navy. He also failed to understand how important charisma is in Vargr society. Julian Menderes was a charismatic leader, one admired by humans and Vargr alike. It would be simplistic to say that the Vargr were also stirred to action by millennia of mistreatment but this was certainly also a factor. This was not the last time the Imperium would have to deal with the Vargr but when they did, they were determined not to repeat the mistakes of the Julian War.

> [!INFO]+ Greener Pastures
> Colonization efforts in the Domain of Deneb saw a significant uptick after the Imperium lost the Julian War. If the Imperium could not have Meshan, Mendan and Amdukan, perhaps the acquisition of Deneb and the Spinward Marches would restore Imperial honor and pride.

> While Charted Space is far too broad a place for events on one side to affect those hundreds of parsecs away, on Capital the Emperor and his court wanted to weave a narrative that cast the Imperium in a favourable light.

>
> Emperor Martin I died in 195 a broken man. He had waited a lifetime to guide the Imperium towards its manifest destiny only to be soundly defeated. His son was crowned Martin II  the same year and decided it was time to change the narrative. In spite of the bloody Pacification Campaigns and their aftermath, the Imperium had become more unified. While the Imperial Navy had been off making war in Antares, the interior of the Imperium was consolidating and its economy was improving. Cleon’s dream was coming true despite there being a few missteps along the way. It was time to guide the young empire to its next phase.

# Outreach and Growth

Despite the unmitigated disaster that was the Julian War, the foundations of the Imperium were not shaken. There were no cries for the Emperor’s head and no discussion in the Moot about dissolving the Imperium. In fact, quite the opposite. Trade had begun to flourish, the piracy threat within Imperial borders was dissipating and the Imperial Navy started to take shape as the ubiquitous force that it is today. Capital became secure and the wealth of the Imperial family, the nobles of the Moot and megacorporate leaders grew exponentially. Any feelings of malaise were quickly swept away by wealth and security.

After Martin II ascended to the Iridium Throne, his first act was to approve the design for a new palace on Capital, one which did not reflect the fortress mentality of Cleon I. While Cleon had to fight to preserve the fledgling empire, his successors enjoyed the benefits of leading an Imperium that was clearly on the rise. Martin II was a well-travelled man and, like his father and grandfather before him, he had the longevity of the Lentuli line. He was 142 years old when he was crowned Emperor and would reign for 49 years. The new palace was a grand structure with tall spires and glistening domes that invoked the medieval castles of Solomani fairy tales. It was supported on grav pylons 500 metres above the Imperial Park, the most ambitious structure of its kind to date. The Emperor moved into the palace with great fanfare on Holiday of the year 200 as the citizens of the Imperium celebrated the bicentennial of Cleon’s grand experiment.

Imperial scouts and members of the diplomatic core had by this time established relations with all five pocket empires of the Solomani Rim. While they were not yet ready to join the Imperium, the Arcturus Federation, Easter Concord, Vegan Polity, Dingir League and Old Earth Union began to trade amongst each other, creating a wealthy microcosm of the Imperium itself. Imperial traders and corporations began to set up shop in the sector and established trade routes to the remote region.

With the Solomani situation seemingly resolved, the Imperium pre-emptively reached out to the Aslan Hierate, signing the Peace of Dark Nebula in 212. This treaty brought a temporary end to the Aslan Border Wars, which had gone on for over 1,000 years, deep into the Long Night. The treaty might have held indefinitely if not for later incursions by colonists from the Old Earth Union. Nevertheless, the treaty was honored for 90 years, bringing a much-needed respite to the war-torn region between human and Aslan space.

The colonies of the Spinward Marches, had grown and expanded to include more star systems, bumping up against and, in some cases, pushing out the previous inhabitants. The growing importance of the region had become clear and the Emperor was resolved to improve access to the frontier sectors ‘behind the Claw’. Transporting the needed materiel across the Great Rift through the Ishirdu system had become impractical and it was time for the Imperium to establish a more easily traversable route. A confrontation with the Vargr in Vland and Corridor was imminent.

# The Vargr Campaigns

Previous attempts to get to Deneb through Corridor met with disaster. Scout and colonial missions into the region were lost, presumably destroyed by the Vargr, who had been a problem in the region even during the reign of the Ziru Sirka. They had snapped up many star systems in coreward Corridor, Vland and Lishun. The Vargr are nothing if not mercurial and while they had held the region for millennia, the dominant powers shifted many times during the Rule of Man and the Long Night.

Imperial Navy fleets were deployed to the border of the Vargr Extents by Martin II in 220 without fanfare. The initial goal was simple: carve a path through the coreward Corridor sector and secure it. The Imperium had learned a lot about fighting the Vargr during the Julian War. They were highly influenced by charismatic leaders and would quickly give up on a cause or change sides when a leader was shown to have failed or when a superior leader took their place. The primary method of cutting a swath through Corridor was simply to use naval force but the Imperium also learned to divide and conquer the disparate Vargr polities that occupied the region, often pitting them against each other. When one leader lost face, Imperial forces went for the jugular before another more apt leader could take his place.

There were two opposed forces at work in the early part of the Vargr Campaigns. The first was the bad memories of the Imperium’s most recent wars. Martin II desperately wanted to avoid the ignominy suffered by his grandfather and father for their involvement in the Pacification Campaigns and Julian War, respectively. Second was the involvement of the Vilani. When in possession of superior forces, the Vilani tendency was to annihilate an opponent, scouring worlds of all life if necessary. The fleet elements that carried out the Vargr Campaigns were largely drawn from Vland and Lishun because of their proximity to Corridor and the majority of their officers and crews were pureblood Vilani. Martin was careful to mitigate their destructive tendencies by adding squadrons from the Core fleets.

The initial thrust of the Vargr Campaigns was to cut a narrow channel into Corridor along the coreward edge of the Great Rift. Where the opportunity presented itself, the fleet would turn slightly more to coreward and cut off low- to medium-population Vargr factions from their rimward holdings. The Imperial fleets were aided by astrography and superior firepower. The Corridor channel was bordered by the Great Rift to rimward and the Windhorn Rift to coreward. There was nowhere for the weaker Vargr forces to run, no safe haven to which they could retreat and regroup. Fight or flight were their only options.

Imperial Naval Intelligence (INI) had a key role in the operation as well, assessing the political situation between the various Vargr states present, making contact with them and establishing allegiances when possible. Naval officers who negotiated well and were seen to be of ‘high charisma’ successfully recruited many of these small polities and colonies, especially those that were oppressed by larger Vargr states or bands of corsairs. These Vargr served as translators and agents for the Imperial juggernaut as it snaked its way through the sector. Segregated Vargr worlds were offered Imperial membership as a boon for their cooperation under the precedent of the Proclamation of 17. Many of their leaders eagerly accepted the offers while others did so only reluctantly. Those who resisted were ferreted out by the INI and imprisoned, deported or executed, depending on the circumstances.

By 230, a serviceable – if hazardous – route had been carved through Corridor, enabling the Imperium to transport much-needed supplies to the colonies. In time, the path was broadened and secured until most of the sector was integrated. The Imperium was keen to avoid making the mistakes they had made during the Julian War, which had the effect of slowing things down. The process was slow but inexorable, taking one or two star systems at a time and then providing incentives for Imperial citizens to repopulate vacated worlds, expanding outward until their borders pushed up against the larger Vargr polities. Settlements became colonies and colonies grew to become independent governments. While the standard narrative of the era depicts the Imperium blasting their way through, it was in fact also a time of peaceful integration with receptive Vargr populations. The Vargr are a disunified race and are quite willing to cooperate and join forces if presented with charismatic leaders, no matter what their species.

Corridor was not the only front. Once the sector was secure, with many of its worlds sporting system defense squadrons and planetary navies of their own by the year 300, Imperial squadrons turned their attention to Vland and Lishun to clean up Vargr incursions and extricate belligerent polities that had gained footholds there. The missions into these sectors eschewed the diplomatic approach and mostly resorted to violent conflict, sometimes with devastating results.

# Dynastic Crisis

Upon his death in 244, Martin II left the Vargr Campaigns only partially complete but was assured of their success. His approach was bearing fruit and he died confident that the Imperium would extend into the Domain of Deneb via Corridor in due time. Unfortunately, Martin did not leave an heir to the throne, bringing a brief pause to the Lentuli line. The ensuing dynastic crisis resulted in the selection of the great-great-great grandson of Cleon II.

There were concerns about his stability before the selection was finalised but powerful members of the Moot pushed it through and Cleon III was made Emperor in 244. It was an unmitigated disaster. The Emperor exhibited many sociopathic and psychopathic behaviours, none more severe than his penchant for murdering those who disagreed with him. Cleon III shot, stabbed, impaled and threw members of the Moot off the ledges of the Grand Palace if they were found to be ‘disagreeable’. It did not take long for the Moot to realise their error. ‘Cleon the Mad’, as he had become known, had to be dealt with. Unfortunately, there were no devices for addressing this unprecedented situation. Desperate times called for desperate measures.

A reluctant Porfiria – herself the oldest issue of the grandnephew of Martin II – accepted the offer of the remaining members of the Moot (the Chancellor himself had been murdered by Cleon and therefore could not personally extend the offer) to ascend to the throne by a new method: the Right of Assassination. Per the dictates of this new convention, Porfiria killed Cleon by her own hand. The fact that Porfiria was not a skilled combatant is largely overlooked by modern historians.

Some claim that Cleon was mortally wounded by a Moot-sponsored hit team, a combat veteran in service to one of the high nobles or possibly even Porfiria’s own bodyguard, after which Porfiria herself came onto the scene and delivered the coup de grâce. Whatever the case may be, the Moot approved the action and she was made Empress Porfiria I in 245.

> [!INFO] THE RIGHT OF ASSASSINATION
> This unorthodox method of selecting a new Emperor was devised after the selection of Cleon III proved to be a bad one. The Moot approved the ability to select a new Emperor by Right of Assassination. This controversial method – which would later cause great strife – included three key tenets:
>
> - The assassin must be a member of the High Nobility.
> - The assassin must kill the Emperor by her or his own hand in the presence of witnesses.
> - The Moot must then approve the new Emperor just as they would under normal circumstances.
>
> Should the last of the three tenets fail to occur, the assassin could be tried for murder in a court of law depending on the circumstances.

# The Porfirian Age

The circumstances of Porfiria’s rise to power were unusual but she proved to be a dignified and admirable Empress. The Porfirian Age is often understated in history texts. She had been reluctant to take charge, yet did so and ruled for over eight decades. There was war but it was handled methodically and without the bravado of the Imperium’s previous military adventures. The era was, historically speaking, unexciting. Imperial borders continued to expand, mostly via diplomacy. The Imperium would – a few centuries later – become embroiled in a Civil War. Many historians theorise that without the stability and growth of the Porfirian Age, the Imperial experiment may have died an early death, becoming a mere footnote in the history of Humaniti.

Porfiria was a free thinker and employed unorthodox methods to solve problems. Recognising that the forces deployed to fight in the Vargr Campaigns were suffering from combat fatigue, the Empress sent the Imperial Guard to fight at their side. The Guard had been expanded to include artillery and cavalry regiments and proved highly effective in its new role, serving as a jump division in some of the most dangerous missions of the war. The deployment of Imperial Guard troops had a positive effect on morale as well. The navy’s communications department created holovideos of their exploits, which were seen by the rank and file everywhere. Each film included segments celebrating the effort and contributions of other Imperial military units as well. The Guard deployment left the Empress vulnerable to an insurrection but this was a heady time for the Imperium. The Moot, the peerage and indeed billions of Imperial citizens were reaping the benefits of Cleon’s dream. Free trade and the security of the empire were making people rich beyond their wildest imagination and giving them a level of stability that neither they nor their ancestors had seen since before the Long Night.

The Vargr Campaigns continued successfully during Porfiria’s reign. With a serviceable route through Corridor, the Imperium established a strong foothold in Deneb and the Spinward Marches, pushing out Zhodani colonies on the spinward-coreward corner of the sector.

In yet another flourish of the Porfirian Age, the Empress abolished the branding restrictions that had been applied to the Imperial Sunburst in 247. Previously, users of the symbol were forced to depict it only in gold on black. Imperial agencies were given permission to alter the colour scheme as they wished so long as the appearance of the logo itself remained the same.

Porfiria was also a great advocate of the IISS and gave the scouts the unprecedented and high-profile task of performing the First Grand Survey of Imperial space. The scouts were to catalogue the astrography, planetology and demographics of the entire Third Imperium. The previous data on the realm harkened back to the Rule of Man so it was high time for an update. The publication of the survey would also serve to unite the Imperium by clearly identifying its boundaries, people, their unique characters and cultures, and the stars and planetary bodies within Imperial borders.

There was also the matter of the Solomani Rim. As the Imperium continued to expand its borders into Massilia, Diaspora and the Old Expanses, it became easier to develop long-distance trade and diplomatic ties with the Rim. Solomani nobles in the Moot had never given up on their desire to reunite with their ancestors. Porfiria sent a mission to confirm haut-Devroe’s Solomani Hypothesis in 305, nearly two full centuries after its initial publication. The mission was well received and the Easter Concord agreed to become an Imperial client state. The Concord partnered with the Imperium to develop the Star Lane, a chain of outposts that ran from the coreward edge of the Solomani Rim to Capital itself. The region was still infested with pirates during this era and the fortification of the Star Lane began to address this problem.

The Imperium had achieved a maximum Tech Level of 13, making it the most advanced polity in Charted Space. New technology included the jump-4 drive and materials and life-support tech that made it possible to settle worlds with insidious atmospheres, opening up a bounty of new territory for development.

As the Porfirian Age came to a close, its primary events occurred far from Capital. The spinward colonies continued to flourish with Regina growing in importance and becoming the capital of its subsector. The powerful but controversial Humboldt family was put in charge of the Vincennes subsector in Deneb, whose capital would one day become one of the most technologically advanced worlds in the Imperium. Vast mineral wealth was found in the belts of Glisten and it was discovered that the worlds of the domain had a higher concentration of Ancients sites than had been found in other sectors. More than 200 sites were discovered, including the only functioning Ancients site ever confirmed on Antiquity in Corridor. The excitement of new discoveries on the frontier captured the imaginations of Imperial citizens and fomented the notion that the Imperium was a vibrant, growing polity with a bright future.

Upon her death in 326, Porfiria’s son Anguistus was crowned Emperor. Anguistus was much loved by the people. He had been born during the first year of his mother’s reign and the public had watched him grow up from infancy. He pledged to continue what his mother had started. While his reign was brief for a Lentuli Emperor, he was credited for being a wise ruler; Anguistus’ steady hand helped to expand Imperial borders and consolidate power, fully incorporating all of the Ilelish, Massilia and Zarushagar sectors. Ilelish had proven to be the most contentious of the three. The sector had had some of the most well-developed and resilient pocket empires to make it through the Long Night and some of its citizens questioned the value of an empire that merely governs the space between the stars, leaving worlds to their own fate.

Despite the rising drumbeat of unrest in Ilelish, Anguistus managed to close out the Vargr Campaigns, having pushed out the most powerful states and establishing garrisons on most of the worlds along the coreward border of Corridor. Similar results were achieved in Vland and Lishun with the Imperium either integrating or pacifying the remaining Vargr.

After the death of Anguistus, his second-born son – the first had died during childhood – was crowned Emperor Martin III in 365. Like his father before him, Martin’s rule was a steady one – at least in its early decades - marked by the consolidation of power, development of the Imperial bureaucracy, growing economies and increasing military might. As a young adult, Martin became keenly aware of the costs of war. He saw his father struggle daily with the management of the Vargr Campaigns. It was a long and costly affair but deemed worth the price. As a student of history, he knew that the expansionist Aslan posed a similar threat. While the as-yet-unincorporated Domain of Sol served as a de facto buffer state between the Imperium and Hierate, Martin recognized the danger posed by this burgeoning alien race. After learning more about Aslan customs and the value they placed on land holds, Martin issued a formal apology to the clans of the Hierate in 377 for trespassing upon their lands. He then designated the Archduke of Ilelish to serve as the Imperial signatory for the landmark Peace of Ftahalr, signed in 380. This treaty secured a non-aggression pact between the Aslan and Humaniti after over 1,000 years of intermittent border wars and established a 30-parsec buffer zone between the Hierate and Imperium. By this time, many Aslan worlds had been integrated into the Imperium, making their residents Imperial citizens. As a gesture of good will between the two species, Martin authorized the establishment of an Aslan regiment in the Imperial Guard.

> [!INFO]- PLAN LAZARUS
> The Peace of Ftahalr established a 30-parsec- wide gap between the Imperium and Aslan Hierate but Emperor Martin and his military high command were still concerned about the expansionist Aslan. The acquisition of land was a biological imperative for them and could not be controlled with treaties. The Peace of Ftahalr put a stop to their advancement into Solomani and Imperial space but only a fool believed the agreement was permanent. The Aslan had already begun to cross the Great Rift and it did not require a psychohistorian to see that the Aslan Hierate and the Imperium would one day clash in the Domain of Deneb.
>
> The Emperor sent agents to meet with the military command of the Archduke of Sol to design a plan of attack against the Aslan should they ever break the treaty. The array of strategic and diplomatic moves was called Plan Lazarus. Unfortunately, the Ilelish Revolt and subsequent events took priority and Plan Lazarus was scuttled after the death of Emperor Martin III in 456. No comprehensive plan to deal with the Aslan threat has ever been developed to take its place.

With the Grand Survey already under way, in 382 the Emperor expanded the IISS mission to collect data on all of the Major Races that bordered the Imperium. The Scout Service was accumulating massive amounts of information and it soon became clear that they would need a dedicated facility to store all of the data, as well as the samples and artefacts they had collected.

As luck would have it, the scouts made an astounding discovery in 399. There was an old Vilani research station on Aadkhien in the Core that contained a virtual copy of the data contained at the AAB on Vland as well as a cornucopia of additional data that had never been synchronised due to the intercession of the Rule of Man and the Long Night. They also discovered that Aadkhien was at the nominal centre of the Imperium and virtual centre of the galactic plane. As far as the scouts were concerned, it was destiny. They relocated the planet’s reclusive and xenophobic Vilani colony to a reservation world and remade Aadkhien into a central repository of information, renaming the world Reference. For more about Reference, see its description in the Cadion subsector on page 198.

The timing could not have been better. The Grand Survey was completed in 420 and over the next few years, the entirety of its findings was collated and stored at Reference.

I tried to calm my crew down any way I could but they were losing it. We’d all heard stories about situations like this but we never thought we’d become involved in one. Some kind of revolt or a viral outbreak or something. We figured they were interdicting the planet. I’d met Shingans before on other worlds and always thought they seemed fine but maybe they were up to something. We had no way of knowing.

Obviously, I couldn’t contact my broker for the freight or cargo but it was looking less and less like that was going to be a thing anyway. I had the Downport’s tightbeam coordinates but I thought better of trying it. You just don’t mess with the navy, especially when something serious like this was going down.

Now it made sense where the other two ships went. They went to the belts to get rocks to throw. The only folks to leave Maaruur were those of us at the highport who passed quarantine. The only Credits we made on that trip were from a few mid passages booked by folks stuck at the highport. We even took a few Shingans on our jump to Khuumiam. It didn’t occur to me at the time but the ones we took were some of the last of their kind. They must have been devastated. Most just stayed in their staterooms during jump and we respected their privacy. We gave them their money back. What else could we do?

# The Imperial Road

By the year 400, the trade routes of the Imperium extended from the frontier sectors of Deneb and the contested worlds of Antares, through the Imperial Core and onward to the purported homeland of Humaniti in the Solomani Rim. While the bulk of trade was limited to the jump-1 routes in each sector, long-range trade missions that ran nearly the entire length of the Imperium were not unheard of. Comparisons to the Silk Road of ancient Terra were made. The network of trade routes that connected East Asia with Southern Europe were likened to those that stretched from Terra to Capital and onward to Antares, Vland and Regina.

The monumental growth of the Imperium resulted in the creation of new megacorporations. Lucien Hortalez founded Hortalez et Cie, a banking and insurance firm that underwrote large-scale development projects and colonial enterprises. Hortalez and other companies like it increased the efficiency of the expansion. Before the existence of such companies, there was little oversight for colonial expeditions. Professional underwriters became a mitigating force, funding projects that had the best chances for success and denying the rest as too risky. These corporations became an uncelebrated engine for Imperial expansion.

Schunamann und Sohn AG (SuSAG) was founded in 252, primarily to manufacture psionic drugs. The corporation expanded into many other markets as well, including pharmaceuticals, medical and surgical products, industrial chemicals, chemical and bacteriological weapons and geneered organisms for industrial and agricultural applications. Over time, SuSAG acquired an unfavourable reputation due to its involvement with psionic drugs and other controversial projects but the corporation and others like it produced many products that improved the lives of Imperial citizens and made it possible to colonize worlds with challenging environments.

The efficiency with which the Imperial bureaucracy managed the domains increased. Individual worlds were allowed to govern themselves as they saw fit, resulting in unique cultural and societal flavours. Cleon’s dream of a massive trade empire, defended by the most powerful and well-equipped navy in history, had come to fruition. While all Imperial worlds enjoyed the benefits of unity, there were those who saw the Imperium not as the realization of a dream but only as an evolutionary step in the development of human civilization. The Imperium felt otherwise; any evolution that was happening stopped at the Iridium Throne.

## THE ILELISH REVOLT

In 418, the government of the Ilelish system, capital of a sector by the same name, declared its independence from the Imperium. Ilelish was the homeworld of the Suerrat human Minor Race. It and many other high-population worlds in the domain had begun to feel neglected by the expanding empire, which had focused most of its resources on defense of the borders, growth of the frontier and the construction of the Star Lane. By 420, 12 other high-population worlds across six subsectors had joined the Ilelish Revolt. The governments of these worlds were united in the belief that independence was the best way forward for them. By design, the Imperium did not interfere in the affairs of individual worlds provided they did not break Imperial law. The leaders of the Ilelish Revolt sought to create a separate state that took a much heavier hand in world affairs, standardising Law Levels, governance and access to technology. This was a crime that invoked the high justice clause, enforced by Imperial military forces.

In exile, the Archduke of Ilelish called Capital for assistance. The Imperium reinforced the Ilelish Sector Fleet with elements of the Dagudashaag and Gushemege fleets and blockaded the worlds involved in the revolt. Most surrendered with minimal violence and Ilelish was the last to fall in 435. To prevent future revolts, the Imperium made an example of Ilelish. They evacuated the lush equatorial region where most of its population lived and blasted it into oblivion, reducing a once vibrant world into a highly populated backwater. The capital of the domain was moved to Dlan. Nearly seven centuries later, Ilelish remains an ecologically and economically devastated world.

The destruction of Ilelish was intended to be an abject lesson: defy the Imperium at your own peril. Emperor Martin III recalled members of the Ilelish peerage to Capital, whereupon he personally revoked many of their noble patents and demoted the Order of Ilelish in precedence. Some were tried and convicted of treason and either executed or shipped off to the prison camp on Sher. Notably, he left the archduke in place. Before sealing the deal, Martin gave a public address in the Imperial Park, on the grounds between the palace and Moot Spire:

> [!quote]
> _The peerage is responsible for the administration of the domains, sectors, subsectors, worlds and continents. If they fail to do their jobs, they risk the integrity of the Imperium itself. Emperor Cleon built this empire on the foundation of duty and honor. Without it, we have nothing._

The Ilelish Revolt had been brewing for decades before it occurred. There were rumblings as early as 399 when several of the domain’s high-population worlds had begun negotiating for an autonomous region, similar to that of the League of Antares. The Emperor knew about this but did nothing, placing his faith in the peerage to resolve the issue. The fabric of the Imperium was the power vested in the archdukes and subordinate nobles to manage their domains. In most such crises, the nobility was successful in this capacity. Not so in Ilelish. Martin saw it as a potential harbinger of things to come and was forced to make significant changes in the way the domains were managed. Cleaning house in Ilelish was just the beginning.

## BAD MOONS RISING

Martin III was killed in an air/raft accident on the Imperial reserve world of Crompton in 456. The Emperor was reportedly taking an evening ride with his consort just as the planet’s two moons were rising on the eastern horizon. He died at the age of 167, once again exhibiting the longevity of the Lentuli line. He outlived his heir, who would have been crowned Martin IV, so his grandson ascended to the throne as Martin V. Unfortunately, the new Emperor did not have the hearty constitution of his ancestors and died of natural causes the following year at 100, middle age by Lentuli standards. Martin’s daughter, Nicholle, was confirmed by the Moot and crowned the second Empress of the Imperium in 457.

Empress Nicholle’s reign was brief and undistinguished. She did oversee the absorption of the Easter Concord into the Imperium in 426, strengthening ties with the Solomani Rim and coming ever closer to integrating Terra. The Star Lane had, by this time, become a secure route from the Imperial Core to the Solomani homeworld. Hundreds of parsecs in the other direction, the Imperium continued to consolidate its holdings in the Spinward Marches, annexing the Vilis subsector and making an enemy of the Sword Worlds, a pocket empire of Terrans who had come to the region centuries earlier aboard sublight generation ships. Things were proceeding apace but most events were the products of historical momentum more than any sort of directed plan. If recent events were any indication, sleepwalking through history was not an advisable approach. However, the Empress showed little interest in developments that were far from the Imperial Court on Capital. Pressed by the Chancellor to appease the burgeoning frontier, the Empress declared Aosta in Deneb to be an Imperial reserve world in 474, the first water world to receive the distinction. The declaration was... underwhelming, not at all what the Moot was hoping for.

Despite the continued expansion of the Imperium, the Moot and its Chancellor were frustrated by the unwillingness of the Empress to address the Imperium’s most pressing issues. Nicholle’s great-grandfather had left unfinished business to his heirs. The Peace of Ftahalr was a singular achievement but most believed it merely delayed confrontation with the Aslan; a long-term solution was required. Furthermore, the Ilelish Revolt had revealed weaknesses in the bureaucracy that required tending to. Nicholle was, by most accounts, disinterested in dealing with such issues. The Moot and a co-conspirator of dubious lineage decided to take action.

Admiral Eledon Shaster, a distant heir of the Zhunastu line, was selected from an extensive cast of characters to become the first non-dynastic Emperor. Admiral Shaster had enjoyed a distinguished naval career, which had earned him the undying loyalty of the Core Sector Fleet. Although he only had tenuous ancestral lines to the original Zhunastu Dynasty, he had exactly what the activist cabal from the Moot wanted: ambition and dubious ethics. Shaster was credited with the assassination of the Empress and her entire family, clearing the way for a new Emperor to take her place. The majority of the Moot cried foul but extortion, death threats and other skulduggery ensured there would be just enough votes to confirm the new Emperor. Shaster was crowned Cleon IV in 475, setting a dangerous precedent for the Imperium. While the previous use of the Right of Assassination was arguably justified since it rid the throne of Cleon the Mad, the assassination of Nicholle merely for being disinterested in the job or ‘too weak’ as Shaster himself had said, would come back to haunt the Imperium.

The reign of Cleon IV was corrupt from the beginning. Five years after his coronation, Cleon revoked the patents of dozens of Vilani nobles, many of whom held positions in the Moot. He then promoted others in their places, most of whom were of either pure or mixed Solomani blood. Coinciding with these events were a number of declarations made by the Emperor that removed regulations and restrictions on the abilities of the peerage to tax the Imperial citizens under their purview. The additional windfall of tax revenue found its way directly into the accounts of the nobility themselves. The megacorporations and merchant lines were making astronomical sums of Credits as the Imperium grew larger and more secure. The peerage wanted their cut and they got it at the behest of a pliable Emperor who served their every whim.

There was no shortage of investigative journalism exposing this corruption but bribery, murder and control of key media outlets kept localised scandals from becoming an Imperium-wide scandal. Meanwhile, Cleon IV distracted the citizens of the Imperium. The Imperium manufactured crises when necessary and in other cases merely took advantage of events that played into their hands. One such event was the Hidden War.

Emperor Martin III had launched a series of Alien Missions in 382 whose intention was to survey the territories of the Major Races. The Vargr Mission occurred from 486 to 499 and included the region of space held by the Julian Protectorate. The Julians did not take kindly to intrusions of their sovereign space and used terrorism and hired Vargr corsairs to harry scouts wherever they could. The Imperium responded by sending Imperial Naval Intelligence (INI) agents to counter the threat. This ‘Hidden War’ was initially classified by the Imperium but received a great deal of media attention in the Julian Protectorate, news of which inevitably found its way back to the Imperium. Emperor Cleon IV used the Hidden War for propaganda purposes, leveraging it as a unifying issue in the Imperium.

Despite the exorbitant wealth and relative stability of the era, the reign of Cleon IV was largely viewed as a blight upon the history of the throne, one which would end as abruptly as it began... with an assassination. Jerome, yet another dubious claimant to the throne, murdered Cleon in 555 in what was likely his deathbed; had Cleon IV been allowed to die naturally, his heir would have ascended to the throne and the non-dynastic era would have ended. However, Jerome made sure to kill the heir and everyone else in his family tree who might have had a claim. Clearly the Moot – or at least an influential cabal therein – was onto something. By removing dynasties before they were allowed to happen, they made the Emperor their puppet. An Emperor beholden to the Moot ruled at the beck and call of the nobility. What could go wrong? As it turned out, a great deal.

As the non-dynastic era unfolded, the foundations of the Third Imperium began to dissolve. The sectors which suffered the greatest losses of power at court were those on the frontiers, several of which were key players in the long-term plans of the empire. The beneficiaries of the centralization of power were the sector dukes and Admiralty. Each pursued their own agendas, which were not always in concert with one another.

The sectors of the Domain of Deneb began to feel the pinch as did the Solomani Rim. In the Marches, it became clear that should a crisis arise they were on their own. This occurred just as tensions with the neighboring Zhodani Consulate, Vargr Extents and Sword Worlds began to rise. Conversely, in the Solomani Rim, the pocket empires began to join the Imperium at an increasing rate, even as the stability of the empire began to dissipate.

Shortly after the assassination of Jerome by Jacqueline, the third of the non-dynastic Emperors, the pieces began to fall into place in the Solomani Rim. The Dingir League joined the Imperium in 582 followed closely by the Arcturus Federation in 583. Empress Jacqueline appointed the first Archduke of Sol, hastening the following events. The Vegan Polity joined in 586 and then finally, the grand prize: the Old Earth Union and its capital at Terra joined in 588. The event was accompanied by a scientific expedition to Terra, which confirmed the findings of the Solomani Hypothesis once again. Terra was the homeworld of all Humaniti and now it was a prized world of the Third Imperium.

Terra had long hung over the Imperium like a Sword of Damocles. As the confirmed homeworld of Humaniti and one of the most powerful economic forces in Charted Space, its destiny was undeniable; yet its integration into the Imperium had been dreaded for centuries. Terra would immediately pose a political threat to Capital. Regardless of its distance from the Imperial Core, the legacy and symbolic power of Terra could not be denied. The integration of Terra had to happen, yet it posed a threat to everything the Imperium stood for, and worse, it occurred just as the Imperium was wavering from self-inflicted wounds. As bad as things had gotten, they were about to become much worse.

# THE FRONTIER WARS BEGIN

See [[The Frontier Wars]]

After decades of sabre rattling, the Zhodani Consulate and two Vargr states – the Ngoerrgh Togzekhz and the Gnaithlloellarrgh Gzolakhgha – launched an attack against the Imperium in the Spinward Marches in 589. The initial plan of the aggressors, who called themselves the Outworld Coalition, was for the Vargr to raid the coreward worlds of the Regina and Aramis subsectors while the Zhodani conquered Cronor and Jewell. The Imperium gained an ally in the Darrian Confederation, which had lost the so-called Entropic Worlds to the opportunistic Sword Worlds, who joined the war on the side of the Coalition.

After receiving word of the war, Empress Jacqueline established the Domain of Deneb, uniting the Spinward Marches, Deneb, Trojan Reach and Reft. However, she did not appoint an archduke to the new domain, giving it no central leadership. The creation of the new domain was intended to be a symbolic move that would carry a great deal of weight. What the worlds of the domain really wanted was Imperial military support.

The war lasted for 15 years with many systems changing hands. The Imperium lost most of the Jewell cluster early but reacquired their foothold in 603 when fleet elements commanded by Grand Admiral Olav hault-Plankwell pushed the Zhodani out of Jewell and Emerald after intense fighting.

The decisive battles of the war were fought in 604. Zhodani Grand Admiral Tliaklabtl attempted to strike a decisive blow in the Battle of Jae Tellona, in which combined Zhodani and Vargr fleets would purportedly overwhelm the colonial forces of the Imperium. However, the Vargr squadrons failed to show up for the battle, leaving the Zhodani to fight alone and they were defeated by Admiral Plankwell with reinforcements from Porozlo. In the Battle of Rhylanor, a young Duchess Arbellatra Alkhalikoi led undermanned Imperial system defense forces against the Zhodani. She was made a captain by Plankwell at the age of 20 as a reward for her accomplishments. The final battle of the war was fought at Zivije, where the Gzolakhgha Vargr and Zhodani made their final stand. They were outmatched by the combined Imperial fleets that routed them. Admiral Plankwell declared victory as exhausted forces on both sides ceased fighting with one another. The two sides in the conflict paused briefly to regroup and rearm.

All told, the Zhodani made territorial gains in Cronor but the Imperium acquired several worlds in Jewell. The failure of the Ngoerrgh Togzekhz Vargr resulted in a civil war that broke the Vargr state apart. The Darrians pushed the Sword Worlds out of the Entropic Worlds with help from the Imperium. An enraged Admiral Plankwell collected elements of his fleet and made his way to Capital.

The respite between the First and Second Frontier Wars was brief. By 609, the Gzolakhgha Empire and the Ekhlle Ksafi (the most powerful splinter state that emerged from the Ngoerrgh Togzekhz Civil War) joined with the Zhodani to prepare for a second war with the Imperium. This time, the Sword Worlds joined the Outworld Coalition at the beginning of the war in an attempt to reacquire all of the worlds they had lost to the Imperium in Vilis.

The Zhodani launched the first attack of the Second Frontier War in 615 at Cipango. The war quickly spread to Jewell and Regina. The Vargr were much more effective allies in the second war. Again without support from Capital, newly appointed Grand Admiral Alkhalikoi executed a holding action with the limited resources at her disposal. The manufacture of several new dreadnoughts, which were quickly launched into action, helped stave off relentless Zhodani attacks. The Imperium was once again joined by the Darrian Confederation, who turned back the Zhodani with the threat of the Star Trigger, a stellar destabilization weapon that was allegedly in their possession. By the end of the war, the Zhodani had conquered all of Cronor and several worlds in Jewell. The Vargr failed to permanently acquire any new territory but made themselves rich with plunder and successfully diverted Imperial forces that would otherwise have fought the Zhodani. The Sword Worlds were soundly defeated by the Imperium, which occupied many of their worlds for five years after the war. Tired of being drawn into these conflicts, 11 worlds in Vilis seceded from the Imperium, becoming independent. Depleted from two devastating wars, there was little the Imperial Navy could do about it.

All in all, the Second Frontier War was disastrous for the Imperium, despite the heroic efforts of its military to stave off the invasion. In most eras, the public would have called for the heads of the Sector Admiralty after taking such a beating but the citizens of the Marches generally understood that they had been abandoned by the Imperium. Like her mentor before her, Grand Admiral Alkhalikoi intended to take their grievance directly to Capital, hoping to achieve more lasting results. She left the sector in the capable hands of Baron Caranda of Regina.

## The Civil War

At the end of the First Frontier War, a furious Grand Admiral Olav hault-Plankwell gathered his remaining forces and made his way to Core. Plankwell intended to express his indignation in the most dramatic way possible: by usurping the throne. He arrived at Capital in 606, purportedly to celebrate the victorious efforts of the First Frontier War but promptly murdered Jacqueline and declared himself Emperor Olav I by Right of Assassination. Olav’s ascendance ended the era of the non-dynastic Emperors but did little to quell the instability of their reign. His brief run as Emperor was cut short when his most trusted officer assembled disgruntled fleet elements, uniting them with squadrons of the Core fleet and defeated Plankwell in battle, declaring himself Ramon I. He was confirmed by the Moot, beginning the disastrous era of the Emperors of the Flag.

A succession of Emperors of the Flag ruled the Imperium for 13 years. Power was acquired by ‘Fleet Control’, in which a prospective claimant to the throne assembled portions of the Imperial Navy, came to Capital, imposed their will upon the current Emperor by defeating loyalist naval forces and then either assassinated or killed him or her in battle.
![[TImp-6319.jpg]]
All of this was arguably made possible by the era of the non-dynastic Emperors who gradually centralised power around Capital and ignored the burgeoning Imperial frontiers. The citizens of the Imperium had come to expect more from their Emperor. The bureaucracy had been appointed by Cleon I to serve with honor and duty. The archdukes, dukes and all of the peerage were to perform as extensions of the Emperor. The untimely assassination of Empress Nicholle 131 years prior to the Civil War had started a chain of events that unravelled the very fabric of Cleon’s Imperium and untethered the strands of duty and honor upon which it was built. It was time for the Imperium to pay the consequences.

## EMPERORS OF THE FLAG

From 609 to 622, a series of short-lived Emperors ruled the Third Imperium. All of them ascended to the throne by Right of Assassination or Right of Fleet Control. All were naval officers of flag rank and all were pure Solomani. Perhaps the darkest hour of the Civil War was the brief era of the Barracks Emperors, in which many claimants to the throne arose, none of whom were confirmed by the Moot and therefore not worthy of mention. The region around Capital briefly became an autonomous state but the Imperial bureaucracy remained in power, preventing the dissolution of the Imperium.

# Saviour of the Empire

Grand Admiral Arbellatra Alkhalikoi is sometimes referred to as the last of the Emperors of the Flag. Doing so is a disservice to her legacy.

Like Admiral Plankwell, Arbellatra assembled elements of her fleet at the conclusion of a Frontier War and promptly embarked upon an epic journey of nearly 150 parsecs from Rhylanor to Capital. Emperor Gustus awaited her arrival with the might of the 1st Fleet at his disposal. Arbellatra defeated the bulk of his forces at the Second Battle of Zhimaway, the system’s most prominent gas giant, and then proceeded to Capital where she assassinated Gustus. Unlike the previous 17 usurpers, Arbellatra did not claim the throne. She asked the Moot to confirm her not as Empress but as Regent. She held the throne in escrow until a suitable candidate could be found. Her actions ended the Civil War and peace finally returned to the Imperium.

As Regent, Arbellatra made allies in the Moot and established a power base among the peerage. By absolving all participants in the war for their actions during it, she established firm control of the military, particularly the navy that had been divided into countless factions by use of the Right of Fleet Control. In an effort to maintain the hard-fought stability that had been restored, the Moot granted the Regent sweeping powers, not unlike those of the Emperor.

Arbellatra promoted the Marquis Caranda, making him the first Duke of Regina. For their loyal service during the Civil War, she rewarded the Geonee by creating the Duchy of Shiwonee and moving its subsector capital to Shiwonee. Arbellatra’s generosity did not extend to all domains. In Antares, she revoked the patent of Archduke Glazdon Deirdin for not supporting the Regency, installing Admiral Soegz in his place, the first Vargr to be so honored. Deirdin was executed for treason. Likewise, in Deneb, Arbellatra revoked the patents of the Humbolts of Vincennes. The Marquis Humbolt had perhaps been expecting a promotion to duke but was sacked for the involvement of his family in numerous criminal activities. The Humbolts disappeared from public view, perhaps exiling themselves somewhere beyond Imperial borders.

In 624, Arbellatra established the Imperial X-Boat Network, which would hasten communications between all of the domains and most importantly to Capital itself. The IISS would manage the system with a network of way stations. Over time, the function of these bases would expand from mere maintenance facilities to full training centres. This move transformed the IISS bureaucratic structure into its current state, establishing Communications, Exploration and Survey branches. The project was expected to take many decades before it was completely functional and serviced the entirety of the Imperium.

The advent of the Imperial X-Boat Network was accompanied by a major event in the history of the IISS: the establishment of the Suleiman -class scout/courier, x-boat and x-boat tender as the primary starships of the service. Previously, the scouts used a broad array of spacecraft manufactured by myriad vendors. With the creation of way stations to service its ships, higher-ups in the IISS bureaucracy realised that the costs of maintaining so many sets of spare parts could bankrupt the service. By standardising on the trio of key starships, the IISS reduced the impact on its budget immensely.

Arbellatra settled in at Capital, re-established the civility of the Imperial court and married Duke Sergey Torgyan Ashran of Cemplas, with whom she had three children: Zhakirov, Anton and Maryam. The first two of her children were born during the Regency era.

After seven years of fruitless searching for a viable heir to the throne, Arbellatra was asked by the Moot to become Empress. Arbellatra was the first of the Alkhalikoi Emperors, returning the Imperium to dynastic rule. The Alkhalikois remain in power in modern times after nearly 500 years of stability.

In the first year of her reign, Arbellatra established the Sylean Worlds cultural zone at the request of the Sylean Concord. The combined leadership of its worlds reminded the Empress that at the Imperium’s darkest hour, they allowed their worlds to become an autonomous state so the empire might survive. They expressed their desire that their worlds should never be used in such fashion again and began the process of demilitarization shortly thereafter. To this day, of all the Sylean Worlds, only Capital maintains a permanent military presence.

> [!info]- A TALE OF TRAMP TRADERS
> A curious historical sidenote from the Civil War era was the creation of the Empress Marava-class far trader. While Marava’s reign was a short one, lasting less than a year, her singular achievement was the felling of the Grand Palace of Martin II, destroying its gravitic suspensors and bringing the fairy tale-style castle crashing into the Imperial Park where it remains to this day. For some, this event signified a new beginning for the Imperium and while there was no reason to believe that Marava’s reign would last any longer than the previous 13 Emperors of the Flag, there was a great deal of excitement about it on her homeworld of Kaskii.
>
> A small and struggling starship architecture firm on Kaskii called Bilitig und Dottir commemorated Marava’s rise to power with the design of the 200-ton jump-2 Empress Marava. The ship featured distinctly Solomani lines, employing the ‘bomber-nose’ look used on some of their bulk freighters. The firm boasted that its jump-2 drive would liberate the ship from the jump-1 mains plied by the ubiquitous Type-A free trader. Never mind that savvy Type-A owners had been fitting their ships with jump-2 drives for centuries; Bilitig brazenly marketed their ship as the first of its kind and boasted that it would revolutionise the tramp trader business.
>
> The initial run of starships sold out in short order but with the death of the actual Empress Marava in the Battle of Sulgami, the class faded into obscurity. Bilitig had banked its entire firm on the project and went bankrupt when a second run failed to materialise the interest of the first. However, with the ascent of Arbellatra to the role of Regent, the class showed new signs of life. By the time she had taken the throne in 629, the Empress Marava -class had finally found a solid market. Its specifications were made available as open source and several starship-construction companies began to manufacture it.
>
> A minor controversy occurred some years later when remnants of the ancient Vilani Garu -class far trader were discovered in the Ley and Glimmerdrift sectors. The clunkier, more utilitarian Garu had a nearly identical interior form factor and deck plan to the Empress Marava. With the proprietors of the Garu design lost in the annals of time and the Marava having become an open source starship, there was no legal conflict to be had. Examples of both classes may now be found in operation throughout Charted Space.

# Belle Epoque

The first years of the Alkhalikoi Dynasty were industrious. A great deal of damage had been done during the Civil War and things had to be set right. The Marine Escort Service and Imperial Guard were reinstated with a marine regiment added to the latter. The intelligence services received a thorough house cleaning, removing administrators and agents who did not exhibit adequate loyalty to the Empress, replacing them with hand-picked successors.

After the dramatic crash of the palace of Martin II, a new one would have to be built. Arbellatra approved a design for a new Grand Palace and construction began immediately. The project was completed in 633. The Grand Palace of Arbellatra was a one-kilometre diameter sphere that floated above the Imperial Park using gravitic lifters. It looked down upon the grounded Palace of Martin II and stood 4.5 kilometres from the Moot Spire, whose peak reached just above that of the new palace. For a complete description of the palace, see The Grand Palace of Arbellatra on page 157.

Arbellatra made many sweeping changes intended to establish the power and security of the post-war Imperium. Others were intended to be subtle. It had not been lost on Arbellatra that all 17 Emperors of the Flag, including herself, were Solomani. To achieve greater balance, Arbellatra promoted many Vilani nobles in the peerage. The integration of the Solomani Rim had been interrupted by the Civil War, so this was a dangerous time to make such changes but she deemed them necessary nonetheless.

The Empress established several new orders of knighthood, including the Order of Hlyuea for loyal Aslan citizens and the Order of Gvadakoung for Vargr. She also founded the Order of the White Star for esteemed psions. Previously, psionics had been viewed with an element of scepticism in the Imperium. This move brought psionics to the forefront, lending them previously unseen levels of validity and acceptance.

The Arbellatran Age was mostly one of peace in which the empire renewed its commitments and worked hard to restore the faith of its citizens. There was the usual array of revolts to put down and a few brushfire wars to attend to but large-scale conflicts were avoided. The era came to an end in 666 upon the death of Arbellatra by natural causes and the subsequent ascendance of her son, Zhakirov.

# Distant Thunder

The early years of Emperor Zhakirov’s reign featured a continuation of his mother’s policies, emphasising security, economic growth and above all, peace. If the 20 sectors of the Imperium were the branches of a tree, withered by the Civil War, those branches were reinvigorated during the post-war era, given bright new leaves, solid branches and a healthy trunk. The central authority of Capital was once again reinforced by an honor-bound nobility. Dissenting dukes and archdukes had their patents revoked and were replaced by those who fully supported the Emperor and served the greater good of the empire.

Sacrifices had to be made to create peace and stability. While the empire was composed of trillions of sophonts, including a multitude of Minor Races, it was still essentially governed by a Vilani-Solomani compact. The Rule of Man may have perished some two millennia earlier but the spectre of Solomani culture still hung over it like a dark cloud. The Solomani nobles who dominated the Moot, fairly or unfairly, were blamed for much of the chaos that had occurred. Their greed precipitated the non-dynastic emperors and fomented the Civil War in which each of the usurpers was of Solomani descent. Empress Arbellatra and her heir, Zhakirov, devised a seismic shift to the centre by promoting Vilani nobles. If this was not a sure sign that the Imperium intended to establish greater balance, Zhakirov made it abundantly clear when he married Antiama Shiishuginsa, a Vilani noble from a powerful family.

Publicly, the shift reflected a desire for greater balance and stability but privately the Emperor knew that he had a new and burgeoning threat to deal with: the Solomani Movement. This movement expressed that it was the destiny of the Solomani people to rule all of Charted Space. The recent integration of Terra and subsequent failure to complete the acquisition of all Solomani territories to rimward made the Solomani Movement dangerous to the empire.

Zhakirov’s death in 688 should have been followed by a smooth transition to the next Imperial heir but the situation was unprecedented: the ascendant Empress Margaret was only four years old at the time of her coronation. A Regency Council governed on her behalf until she was determined to have come of age. Cynical factions in the Moot – especially aggrieved Solomani – saw this as an opportunity to foment yet another dynastic crisis, possibly creating a second civil war, but cooler heads prevailed and Margaret was permitted to take the throne.

Under the advice of her Chancellor and key members of the Moot, Margaret declared the Solomani Autonomous Region with the Mandate of 704. This gave the Solomani semi-independence in a 50-parsec radius from Terra. The Mandate placated the powerful Solomani region and established much-needed separation between the Rim and Solomani agitators in the Imperial court, yet set the stage for problems down the road. The Imperium had by this time reached a maximum Tech Level of 14, surpassing the abilities of all of its neighbors. Its navy was the most powerful military force in Charted Space but its officer corps was still dominated by Solomani. To prevent the Imperium from returning to the self-destructive days of the Civil War, concessions had to be made to the Solomani Rim. Over time, it became increasingly obvious that no amount of conciliatory action could satisfy the adherents of the Solomani Movement.

# THE SOLOMANI MOVEMENT

The Imperium awakened a sleeping giant when its scouts made contact with the disparate pocket empires of the Solomani Rim. The people of the Arcturus Federation, Easter Concord, Vegan Polity, Dingir League and most importantly of all, the Old Earth Union, could hardly have known how much the far greater empire to coreward feared and dreaded a future in which the combined might of the Solomani Rim would be brought to bear against them as a unifying force. Shortly after the Imperial scouts made contact, haut-Devroe published the Solomani Hypothesis, expressing that not Vland, Shiwonee or any of the other poseurs were the birthplace of Humaniti. The evidence overwhelmingly proved beyond doubt that humans originally came from Terra.

The Solomani Hypothesis was barely noticed when it was first published. With the integration of the Rim, the hypothesis became a rallying cry that helped spawn the Solomani Movement. There was little the Imperium could do to prevent an eventual day of reckoning. The best the Emperor could hope for was to delay it and that is exactly what happened.

In the Solomani Autonomous Region, the core structure of Imperial rule was dismantled while the Imperium blithely looked on. In truth, there was little that could be done. A war-weary populace was loath to get into another major conflict so soon after the Civil War. The mixed results of the Pacification Campaigns hung over the Imperium like a spectre. While they had been successful by and large, most of the peerage felt that Artemsus’ crowning achievement was a slap in the face to Cleon I, who advocated diplomacy, not force of arms, to incorporate worlds into the empire. Furthermore, the failure of the Antarean campaign would always haunt the Imperium. It was difficult to imagine overcoming a region with the size and power of the Solomani Sphere when the Imperium had failed to defeat the considerably smaller Julian Protectorate. However, the Imperial Navy had grown immensely in the intervening centuries. Mathematically speaking, the navy could take on just about any opponent if it set its collective mind to it but the public simply would not support such a bold, aggressive move. As so often happened in the history of Humaniti, it would require a crisis to push the Imperium over the edge and into conflict.

## THE RISE OF THE SOLOMANI CONFEDERATION

### DISSOLUTION OF THE NOBILITY

Noble patents are vacated. Hardliners come under fire from a hostile Solomani population.

- 716: The Archduke of the Domain of Sol dies. His seat is left vacant.
- 735: The Duke of Albadawi dies. His heir spurns the title and joins the Solomani Movement.
- 760: Most noble patents are vacated. Violent coups force many into exile. Some are recalled to Capital.

### REVOLUTION

The Solomani Movement sweeps over the Rim.

- Pro-Imperial factions voted out, forced into exile or violently overthrown.
- 720: The Esperance World War: Majority-Vegan nation of Waothan defeated by Nueva Argentina. Waothanian Vegans become second-class citizens.
- 750: Government of Nusku overthrown by radical Solomani. Full citizenship granted only to genetically pure Solomani.
- 780: The Pontiffs of Tonopah join the Solomani Movement but preach that all sophonts are equal.
- 786: SolSec-supported rebels topple Jardin’s government. The remaining systems in the subsector fall in line.
- 860: Momentum grows for the creation of a fully independent Solomani state.
- 871: The Solomani break the Peace of Ftahalr by settling worlds in the buffer zone.

### THE NEVER IMPERIAL MOVEMENT

- The Imperial Civil War interrupted the full integration of the Solomani Rim.
- Border worlds forego Imperial membership for Solomani. The Movement spreads.

### SOLOMANI CONFEDERATION

- The Solomani Autonomous Region secedes from the Imperium in 871, declaring the Solomani Confederation. The Imperium ignores the declaration.
- The Palace of the Secretary-General is completed on Terra in 876.
- Laurence Trinoch’s The Solomani Destiny published on Home in Aldebaran in 881.

## AND THE BAND PLAYED ON

Despite the imminent showdown with the Solomani Rim on the horizon, the Imperium as a whole was perhaps more stable than it had ever been. The Alkhalikoi Dynasty proved to be an enduring one.

The Scout Service, now ubiquitous in Imperial space, was further enhanced by the advent of the Detached Duty branch. One could muster out of the scouts but the scouts never truly mustered out of its former employees. A scout is a scout for life. To enhance its commitment to the reserves, the IISS developed a program by which retired personnel could gain access to a scout/courier of their very own provided they respond to the summons of the Scout Service when required. In addition to providing a purpose for retired Type-S ships, the move made scout veterans into a de facto source of intelligence. Flitting about in their loaner starships, they collected data that might otherwise have been missed by intelligence agencies.

By 718, the Imperial X-boat Network had been expanded to cover all of Imperial space, ensuring that information travelled from one end of the Imperium to the other at jump-4 speed. While the prospect of governing such a vast expanse of space was and continues to be a daunting task, the Imperial X-boat Network ensures that its remote fiefs remain in communication with Capital.

Speaking of Capital, its grandiosity continued to grow. The Grand Palace of Arbellatra acquired several annexes. In 729, Empress Margaret had the Consortium Trinary built, a trio of smaller spheres that would appear to ‘orbit’ the Grand Palace. The three spheres contained museums dedicated to the Ziru Sirka, Rule of Man and Third Imperium, respectively. Access to the public was limited but the Trinary was made available to academics year round.

Tragically, Empress Margaret died in a tunnel collapse while visiting the Imperial Reserve World of Onon in 736. Margaret’s reign was unremarkable on the whole, remembered more as an era of stability than for grand achievements. Her twin brother, Paulo, was confirmed by the Moot as the new Emperor. Margaret left no heir, which could have caused a dynastic crisis but Paulo was so well-suited to the crown that he was an easy choice for the Moot. He was educated, erudite and well-prepared for the role despite having suffered the cruel hand of fate by being born a mere 22 minutes after his twin sister.

Paulo’s reign was similar to that of Margaret. He continued to cultivate relationships with the peerage and kept the peace on Imperial borders, most notably with the Zhodani Consulate. Other than putting down a few minor revolts, Paulo did not embroil the Imperium in conflicts. In 740, he left his mark on Capital, adding yet another annex to the Grand Palace. Paulo’s Annex was a pleasure palace, a place where visitors could indulge in myriad forms of entertainment. Fine dining, the performing arts, sporting events and countless other diversions were featured. Beginning in 740 the annex would serve as the primary site of the Emperor’s Games, a decennial sporting event.

The greater inclusion of Vilani nobles in the Moot and promotion of their cultural principles was a key component in this era of prosperity and stability. If there was one thing the Vilani were good at, it was running a bureaucracy. Paulo was a great student of Imperial history and the parallels of his era and that of the Ziru Sirka before its fall were not lost upon him. He certainly did not want to see the growing Third Imperium fall to the burgeoning threat of the Solomani, just as the Ziru Sirka had fallen to the Terran Confederation thousands of years before. The Imperium was not yet ready to confront the Solomani crisis directly. Instead, he simply shepherded the empire along its current course.

Emperor Paulo died of natural causes in 767, and his son, Tomutov, ascended to the throne. Alas, the weight of the crown was too much for Tomutov, who abdicated after two years. His sole legacy was the construction of Tomutov’s Palace, another annex to the Grand Palace. Tomutov’s Palace was a place of welcome, where esteemed visitors to Capital could stay when they came to see the Emperor.

Tomutov’s oldest offspring ascended to the throne as Paula II in 768, beginning another era of steady Alkhalikoi rule. Paula was only 16 when she took the throne but took to the role quickly. Her first test of leadership would come a mere four years into her reign.

## The Psionic Suppressions

In 772, it was discovered that many of the Imperium’s 65 chartered psionic institutes had been infiltrated by the Zhodani Consulate. For most of Imperial history, psionics had been looked upon as an oddity of sorts. While the practice of psionics was never fully embraced in the Imperium, there had been psionics clubs and psionicology university programmes since the age of the Sylean Federation. Prior to the formation of the Third Imperium, there were even worlds governed by psionic leaders.

Psions occupied many useful roles throughout the Imperium, often serving as valuable aides to the Emperor, members of the Moot and megacorporate officers. There were even specialized psionic soldiers in service to the military and intelligence agencies. The discovery that just a portion of them had been infiltrated by the Zhodani set loose a wave of hysteria. The scandals extended to all levels of society and Imperial citizens began to question whether their leaders at all levels had been compromised by mind-controlling psions. The xenophobic fear of the Zhodani was just one aspect of the crisis. People began to question the financial, ethical and moral implications of the use of psionics. Were the markets fair or were they manipulated by telepaths and clairvoyants? Was it right for a powerful noble to use a psion to read the minds of his political adversaries or to manipulate public sentiment in his favour? Were the nobility the puppets of psions? The practice of psionics, which had become an accepted, if somewhat obscure, part of Imperial society was now being questioned at all levels.

The scandals went on for decades, coming to a head in 792 when the pro-Zhodani government of Attica in the Spinward Marches came under fire. Members of the public asserted that Zhodani-trained psions had manipulated the outcome of what were supposedly free elections. Attica became a lightning rod for growing anti-psionic sentiments and quickly descended into chaos as protests against the government became violent. Elected officials invited Zhodani peace-keeping troops to restore order and an Imperial Navy squadron blockaded the world in response to the Zhodani incursion. The government fell before things got further out of control and both the Zhodani and Imperium withdrew. As news of these events swept across the Imperium, anti-psionic fervour grew.

In 800, Empress Paula II signed the first of 65 suppression orders for all psionic institutes operating within Imperial space. All of the institutes were ordered to cease operations and training programmes immediately. The hysteria carried over the border into the Solomani Autonomous Region where a similar anti-psionic pogrom took place. By 826, all of the institutes had their charters revoked and practicing psions were forced underground.

While the Psionic Suppressions garnered massive ublic support, not everyone was quite so sanguine about the whole affair. The Imperial megacorporation SuSAG had a highly profitable psionic drug business and was badly affected by the suppressions. Sympathetic members of the peerage – especially those who held SuSAG stock – pleaded for exemptions that would save the company from suffering more damage to its finances and public image. There was also the matter of psionically sensitive alien races. There were several Minor Races within Imperial borders whose rights were oppressed as a direct result of their use of psionics. In addition, the Droyne had just been declared a Major Race in 790 after a consortium of archaeologists, historians and xenobiologists determined that their scattered populations were a single species. The fact that Droyne civilization was based on the use of psionics did not play in their favour. The IISS promptly interdicted the worlds of Andor and Candory in the Five Sisters subsector of the Spinward Marches, which were considered to be possible homeworlds of the Droyne. The Imperial Navy sent a follow-up mission to secure the subsector.

The Psionic Suppressions were highly successful. Those who still practiced psionics had to do so in private, sliding into a dangerous and hostile underworld. The Suppressions were the signature achievement of Paula II but some wondered whether the Imperium had gone too far. The public had been gripped by mass hysteria, so easily condemning an element of society that had long been thought benign.

> [!info]+ CONSPIRACY THEORIES
> At the conclusion of the Psionic Suppressions, there were numerous conspiracy theories about who the ‘real’ culprits were. Many theorised that the Zhodani were an all-too-convenient bad guy and that their base of power was far too remote to have infiltrated the Imperium so completely. Some of the more popular conspiracy theories included the following:
>
> - The Imperium got tricked into getting rid of their psionic institutes by SolSec.
> - The Psionic Suppressions were a Hiver manipulation.
> - The Zhodani were indeed the culprits, but the primary bad actors were from a Consulate client state in The Beyond sector.
> - None of the institutes were actually closed. A psionic manipulation prevented the closures from happening. They were moved, though, to hide them from public view.
>
> None of these were true, of course, but the last one came the closest. Two psionic institutes remained open after the Psionic Suppressions ended. They were on Regina and Terra, both kept open by the Imperial Department of Defence. The institute on Regina was eventually moved to Wypoc in Lanth, but the one on Terra is still there.
>
> Of all the theories that came about, the one that gained the most traction came nearly two centuries after the fact. In his book, Almost Disaster , Imperial Historian Albert Croale posited that the Psionic Suppressions were a psychohistorical manipulation designed to eliminate the growing power of the psionic institutes. In the text, he surmised that they worked too well, making it impossible for the Imperium to continue using psionics in any capacity. Croale also said that a straight examination of the psychohistorical mathematics indicated that the Third Frontier War, which did not occur until 979, should have actually happened in the late 700s, but that the Psionic Suppressions effectively delayed the war for 200 years.

## Project LongBOW

 For reasons that were mysterious at the time, the Empress initiated a covert project in 830 called Project Longbow or more accurately, LongBOW (Long Baseline Observation Window). The goal of the project was to create an immense radar telescope, 46 billion kilometres in diameter, with its collector plane at the Lishun Depot. The purpose of the elaborate device was to view the galactic core where the Zhodani had been sending expeditions for centuries. Rumor had it that deep Imperial scouting missions had discovered something wrong far beyond the Zhodani Consulate and Vargr Extents borders. While any data received would be centuries old, it would give the Imperium time to prepare for what, if anything, might come their way. The project was not completed until 940.

# Prelude to War

Empress Paula II died of natural causes in 836, leaving the throne to her third child, who was crowned Tomutova II. Paula had held the Imperium together through a crisis and it was now time for her daughter to see it through yet another challenging phase of history. Tomutova’s reign was almost deliberately bland with its only notable event being the creation of the Imperial Academy of Science and Medicine in the Core in 845. A seemingly innocuous development, the creation of the IASM is now greatly credited for the advancement of technology that gave the Imperium the upper hand in its upcoming conflict with the Solomani Autonomous Region.

Tomutova, like many Empresses and Emperors before her, was an avid adherent of psychohistory. She was confident that the hand she played would enable the Imperium to win its eventual conflict with the Solomani. She also knew that it would occur long after her death but in Tomutova’s mind the outcome was certain. It was satisfying enough to know that she played her part, preparing and arming for the conflict to come despite having to endure the lashes of public opinion as one system after another fell to the Solomani.

Tomutova died in 908, passing the torch to her oldest child, who was crowned Margaret II. The Alkhalikois continued to play the long game and a succession of wise rulers paved the way towards a psychohistory-guaranteed victory over the Solomani. This was a game the Imperium had been preparing for since Artemsus wisely resisted the temptation to integrate Terra in the early 200s. Every psychohistorical prediction that included the too-early incorporation of Terra had set off alarm bells and changed the maths for the entire Imperial project. Like Napoleon escaping from Elba, Terra was an old conqueror that would have to be put in its place before peace could finally be had.

Empress Margaret patiently watched as the upstart Solomani Confederation – which remained unrecognized by the Imperium – continued to spread the Solomani Movement among its worlds and threatened to spill over the border into Imperial space. By 920, she began to receive appeals for protection by worlds that had remained loyal to the Imperium. In response, she made several demands of the Solomani- taking great care to only indirectly address the Solomani Party Secretariat and its Secretary-General - ratcheting up the tension. The Imperium, she said, would not be intimidated or cowed from protecting Imperial citizens. She dispatched naval squadrons to secure worlds along the borders of the Solomani Autonomous Region. This stoked the fury of the Solomani Confederation but there was little that they could do at this point.

By 938, skirmishes between Imperial and Solomani naval squadrons had begun to flare up in the Daibei, Diaspora and Old Expanses sectors. The Solomani Movement had become fractious and the Imperium sowed division between factions where it could. The success of Imperial forces garnered more defections to the Imperial side and, in a few cases, bold members of the peerage returned to administer worlds that had been previously lost. Fearing the advancement of the Solomani Movement might be halted by Imperial incursions, the Confederation issued a formal complaint to the Empress that she was violating the tenets of the Mandate of 704. After months of silence, the Empress responded by revoking the Mandate and ordering the immediate reintegration of the Solomani Autonomous Region into the Imperium in late 940. The drums of war began to beat ever louder.

Like her mother before her, Margaret had trained her heir since birth to prepare for this moment. Margaret had grown old and infirm and suspected that Tomolin would be the Empress whose role it would be to pacify the Solomani. Alas, Tomolin died in 944 after exposure to an alien pathogen. Margaret feared that this single event might derail centuries of planning. Tomolin’s son Styryx, then an officer in the Imperial Marines, was headstrong and had many connections with Solomani factions in the military. She was leery about whether her grandson could be depended upon to properly execute the plan but psychohistoric predictions rarely depend upon a single individual, even if that person is the Emperor. Margaret died in 945, secure in her belief that the Imperium would prevail despite her concerns.

Emperor Styryx inherited an Imperium primed for war. Along the Imperial-Solomani border, worlds changed hands between the two sides with a net gain going to the Imperium. Meanwhile, in the Spinward Marches, commerce raiding along the coreward border by Zhodani and Vargr starships had reached epidemic levels. One would think that the Emperor would have heeded the lessons of the past by paying closer attention to events in the Marches but Styryx was obsessed with the Solomani crisis.

Styryx and his wife were quick to produce an heir, Gavin, born in 946, just one year after Styryx’s ascension to the throne. Styryx was young, healthy and hale after his brief career in the marines and expected to have a long life but now was not the time for the Imperium to suffer a dynastic crisis should anything happen to him.

He fostered the growth of the IASM, extending it to 31 campuses throughout Imperial space. The Imperium was driving hard toward a heretofore unseen Tech Level 15 with early prototypes of weapons, electronics and starships already in circulation.

As tensions continued to rise, Styryx stoked the flames by appointing a naval commission in 970 to ‘manage’ the Solomani Autonomous Region, a sure-fire sign that an invasion was being planned. He channelled the majority of the Imperial military budget to the navy at the expense of the other services, creating a stir in the joint command structure. Senior officers of the army and marines questioned how they were supposed to secure Solomani worlds in the upcoming war without proper funding. Styryx also poked the Solomani beehive by making post-war plans for the region. In 975, a well-appointed task force from the diplomatic corps laid the groundwork for a Vegan Autonomous District. Up to this point, the Solomani had been able to focus on the coreward front. By offering pre-emptive concessions to the Vegans, the Emperor had the Solomani looking over their shoulders as well.

# Interlude: Third Frontier War

With the Imperium almost completely focused on the Solomani front, yet another Outworld Coalition, led by the Zhodani Consulate, launched a surprise attack in the Spinward Marches in 979. The Coalition fleets concentrated their initial attacks on the Efate, Boughene and Pixie systems in an attempt to cut off Jewell and Querion. The Vargr aided in the attacks but focused on commerce raiding to keep Imperial auxiliary forces busy. Deep strikes by the Zhodani established a narrow corridor through Vilis and Lanth, preventing the easy transit of Imperial forces through the region. This would normally have been the province of the Sword Worlds who – suffering through a constitutional crisis – sat this war out.

Just as it had in previous Frontier Wars, the Imperium found itself caught off balance and inadequately prepared. In 980, the Coalition established a foothold on Jae Tellona and Porozlo fell to their forces after a major invasion. Porozlo would serve as a marshalling point for a relentless assault on Rhylanor that lasted the duration of the war.

The attacks and raids by the Coalition reached their apex in 981, allowing the Zhodani to make territorial gains in Jewell and Querion. The war was a disaster for the Imperium. Coalition forces were forced to withdraw from the battle for Rhylanor after the arrival of Imperial reinforcements from the Deneb Sector Fleet and the 194th Fleet out of Sabine but by then the damage was done. At the end of the war, the Imperium ceded systems in both Jewell and Querion, and was forced to demilitarise portions of Vilis under the terms of the Armistice. Quar was made an independent world though its Imperial Navy base remained intact. Likewise, the research station at Retinae was retained. Arden was spun off into an independent world that then reached out to neighboring worlds to initiate the creation of a neutral federation, eventually becoming a buffer state between the Imperium and Zhodani Consulate.

Imperial forces had taken heavy casualties, far more than in any of the previous Frontier Wars. In one of the more egregious incidents of the war, the entire 910 th Imperial Marine Regiment was lost in action. It was scandalous that for the third time in Imperial history, the Spinward Marches had been left to its own devices after being brazenly attacked by the Zhodani and their allies. In 989, the military and its supporters in the Moot had had enough. With  the support of the military joint command structure, Imperial Guard General Nicolai Dienne staged a palace coup to overthrow Styryx. Only the Scout Guard remained loyal to the Emperor but they were quickly defeated by the Aslan Guard who took point during the assault. Styryx, who was found hiding in a fresher, surrendered and consented to abdicate the throne in favour of his son, Gavin.

Gavin’s first major act as Emperor was to commission the Scout Service to begin its Second Survey of Imperial space in 990. The maps and demographic data collected during the First Survey had become obsolete. He instructed the scouts to save the Solomani sectors for last since its borders, he confidently assured them, would soon be changing. The event was commemorated with the introduction of a new starship class: the Donosev-class survey ship, named for Villemina Donosev, the Master Chief Surveyor who was famous for having published the First Survey in 420. Subsequent starships in the class would be named for other famous scouts.

One of Gavin’s final pre-war acts was to disband the Solomani Regiment of the Imperial Guard, vowing to reinstate it after the crisis in the Rim was addressed.

I didn’t want my last memory of him to be the angry shouting match at the dinner table the night before. When I begged him to reconsider, he just spouted more of that Solomani Movement stuff. About how being of Solomani blood makes you special and how you have a unique destiny. The last straw for him was when Mr. Dimaakhuna assigned him to lathing duty at the plant. Leule said he couldn’t stand another day of working for that Vilani... well, I don’t want to repeat the next word. It’s impolite and besides, I always thought Mr. Dimaakhuna was a fair and reasonable boss.

Leule said he would pledge himself to the Movement there, hoping to join one of the more extreme factions. Our family had roots in the Old Expanses dating back  to the Rule of Man. I tried to convince Leule that there was no way he could know if we were really ‘genetically pure’ Solomani or not. Our homeworld was a place where Vilani and Solomani had mixed for thousands of years. The tests were inconclusive but he said he could feel it in his blood that he was ‘pure’.

I fought in the Battle of Martham Prime in the first year of the war. Things didn’t go well early on and we got pushed back. The thought of retreating to my homeworld and defending it against Solomani invaders terrified me. The idea that Mother, Father and our younger sister would be endangered kept me up at night.

As for Leule, I never saw him again. I heard that he fought in the Battle of Gresham, where I was stationed for a while, but even although I tried, I couldn’t find him. I will always wonder what happened to him.

# The Solomani Rim War

Distraction and indecision followed the Imperial defeat in the Third Frontier War. After the coup, abdication of Styryx and quick ascension of Gavin, the Imperial fleets were temporarily ordered to stand down and await further instructions. News takes time to travel across the broad expanse of the Imperium but once couriers had made it to the front, the subsequent pause allowed the Solomani to retaliate and regain most of the worlds they had recently lost. The Imperium declared that this would not stand and declared war on the Solomani Confederation in 990.

In the early battles of the war, things went poorly for the Imperium. The massed Solomani fleets and ground forces repelled the Imperial advance and actually ended up conquering several worlds that had never previously been a part of the Solomani Confederation. After three years of war the Imperium had suffered a net loss of worlds. Emboldened by their success, the Solomani attempted to regain lost territory in the Old Expanses only to be sharply rebuffed, especially on worlds with large Vilani populations. Now firmly in the Imperial camp, the Old Expanses Sector Fleet delivered a devastating blow to the Solomani, inflicting heavy losses that prevented them from going on the offensive for almost the entirety of the war.

The two sides were stalemated for the next five years, neither gaining significant ground on the other. The Solomani had become obsessed with the defense of every single world along the border, precariously stretching their forces in the process. Meanwhile, the Imperial Navy was in a period of rapid technological advancement, moving to TL15 and improving its fleets to a jump-4 standard. By 998, the Imperium was prepared to prosecute the war with great alacrity.

Grand Admiral Baroness Arielle Adair massed the Imperial fleets and proceeded into the Solomani Confederation in two distinct columns, conquering hundreds of worlds and carving a crescent of star systems within the Solomani sphere. By 1001, the worlds of the former Vegan Polity had been liberated. Having long been oppressed by the Solomani, the Vegans made natural allies for the Imperium. They welcomed their liberators and invited them to establish permanent bases on their worlds from which they could continue their long march into Solomani space.

Admiral Ivan Wolfe took charge of the Solomani Grand Fleet and prepared for a last-ditch effort to preserve the heart of the Confederation. ‘Grand’ may have been a bit of a misnomer. After four years of retreat, what was left was a ragtag assemblage of capital ships bolstered by replacements from the rimward shipyards. The Solomani had been hard-pressed to keep up their fleets under persistent assault from the larger, more advanced Imperial fleets. Jump-4 capability enabled Imperial squadrons to leapfrog the front lines to decimate Solomani reinforcement fleets and auxiliaries before returning to the front.

Despite the attrition the Solomani fleets had suffered, Wolfe managed to inflict major damage on the Imperial 17th Fleet at Agidda before moving on to attempt a similar attack on the 1st Fleet in the Vegan District. However, the reconstituted 17th Fleet regrouped and proceeded to Dingir where it delivered decisive blows on Wolfe’s rear guard, cutting off his fleet’s supply lines and essentially destroying its ability to function. Wolfe was forced to withdraw and was harried by the Imperial 1st Fleet during his retreat to Aldebaran.

> [!note]- TEST OF LOYALTY
> Pureblood and mixed-heritage Solomani occupied many stations in the Imperium. Prior to the Alkhalikoi Dynasty, the Solomani dominated the Moot and composed most of the Imperial Navy High Command. There were some defections to the Solomani Confederation but the vast majority remained loyal to the Imperium. By the time of the Solomani Rim War, the Imperium was nearly 1,000 years old and it had been two and a half millennia since the fall of the Rule of Man. While vague notions of loyalty to Mother Terra existed, new and more lasting loyalties to the Third Imperium had taken their place for most humans of Solomani descent.
>
> Many found the Solomani Movement to be distasteful. Adherents of the movement declared that it was not just humans but only Solomani humans whose destiny it was to rule the stars. The Imperium had long moved on from such notions. In the Declaration of 17, Emperor Cleon I had declared that Imperial citizenship was extended to all sophonts. Furthermore, the Imperium had already been a hybrid state of Solomani, Vilani and, of course, Syleans even before Cleon’s declaration. The Imperium had come to include Aslan, Vargr and dozens of Minor Races among its citizenry as well. Aslan served in the Imperial Guard. A Vargr had been appointed Archduke of Antares. The notion of Solomani supremacy seemed barbaric and outdated to most Imperial citizens no matter their heritage.
>
> By the late 900s, the Imperium had a great deal of momentum. It had been centuries since it went through the crucible of the Civil War. The stable Alkhalikoi Dynasty – whose matriarch Arbellatra was herself Solomani in origin – had established over three centuries of stable rule. While many Solomani had balked at the greater inclusion of Vilani nobles in the Moot, the origins and power structure of the Third Imperium were still very much rooted in Solomani traditions and culture. To many of Solomani origin, the Imperium was thought of as the far-more-effective successor state to the Rule of Man.

> One of the more understated subtexts of the Imperial narrative was its advancement of technology. Before the Rim War, the Imperium was on the fast track to TL15, two full levels over that of the front-line Solomani. Coupled with the growing wealth of its worlds and its vast trade routes, it was difficult to argue with the pre- eminence of Imperial power. It was hard to recruit defectors from a side whose progress and growth was so clear for all to see. There may have been Solomani sympathisers among the ranks but there were simply too many reasons to remain loyal to the Third Imperium for most of them to switch sides.

Imperial High Command rallied its forces for the final assault on Terra. With 14 squadrons and five army corps, the Imperium engaged in an assault that lasted nearly six months. Things became so desperate that the Imperium considered using nuclear weapons late in the battle but cooler heads prevailed. By the end of the battle, the Imperium had landed over two million troops on the surface of Terra. Late in 1102, the Solomani surrendered the world and an armistice was signed. While no formal peace agreement was ever signed, the Imperium managed to conquer and occupy approximately 25 percent of the Solomani Autonomous Region where they remain to the current day. The defeated Solomani Confederation relocated its capital to Home in Aldebaran. Admiral Wolfe stationed his fleet there and was elected Secretary-General.

# The Classic Era

With the return of peace to the Imperium, Emperor Gavin restored the Order of Sol (after first degrading it in precedence) and appointed Admiral Adair as the new Archduchess of Sol in 1003. The archduchess at first administered the affairs of the domain from Muan Gwi, elevating the standing of the Vegans to new heights and then eventually moved her offices to the sector capital at Dingir. The manor of the Secretary-General on Terra was converted into a centre for diplomacy, dedicated to finding peaceful solutions to all of the issues that the Imperials and Solomani had with one another. Adair got started with the long and arduous task of re-establishing the peerage in the Domain of Sol and extricating Solomani Movement cells from the hundreds of worlds that were now under the Imperial aegis.

Adair formed the Vegan Autonomous District in 1004, cementing the loyalty of a key Solomani Rim constituent and establishing a firm base of power in the centre of the sector. In 1005, the archduchess created the Order of Muan Gwi, which was used to recruit honorable Vegans to the ranks of the nobility.

Adair and Wolfe, once adversaries on the battlefield, now began a long, cold stare down across the border between the two polities. The Solomani established a new reserve, the Home Guard, in 1005 to serve as the front line of defense for the depleted Confederation. Solar Shipping, the Solomani megacorporation, cancelled all lines in the occupied zone. At first there was very little trans-border activity between the two polities but it proved impossible to prevent all travel. Separated families had to be reunited, certain types of property had to be returned and basic diplomatic communication was restored.

The battle lines may have been drawn but the two sides had little interest in renewing the conflict. The Solomani had scant hope of removing an entrenched and powerful Imperium. They would have to be satisfied that their Confederation remained largely intact even if they had lost Terra and other key worlds. The vast Imperium had other fish to fry. It ready time to finally give the frontier its due. The Spinward Marches was the vanguard of Imperial expansion and after three Frontier Wars, it was high time that the region received some attention.

A fortuitous development of the Gavinian Age was the advent of the Authentic Movement. The principles of the movement were developed in 988 by Dr. Johann Kramm at a university on Shudusham, only four parsecs from Capital. This movement posited that the human spirit was diminished in high-technology societies but that it could be replenished by celebrating one or more of the myriad cultures of Charted Space, both current or historical. People were encouraged to select a culture, study it with great detail and express themselves through its lens. Wearing the unique dress of the culture, learning its language, reading its literature and serving as a sort of volunteer ombudsman for the culture were deemed to be activities that would renew the human spirit. The Authentic Movement became a sensation in the Core and began to spread to neighboring sectors as well.

The Authentic Movement reached the Solomani Rim by 1010 and received a frosty welcome by occupying Imperial forces and the renascent peerage. There were concerns that it might foment rebellion among Solomani citizens who had just come to terms with the occupation. As it turned out, the effect was quite the opposite. Many of the people of the Rim acquired a newfound tolerance and respect for other cultures by participating in the movement. By 1050, the movement had acquired as much popularity in the Rim as anywhere else in Imperial space. While many Solomani people selected Terran, Rule of Man and Old Earth Union cultures to emulate, a significant percentage of the population chose cultures well outside those boundaries. Some even chose Vilani cultures. The Authentic Movement helped to pacify the Solomani Rim and eased the integration of the occupied worlds into the Imperium.

Upon Gavin’s death in 1031, the throne was passed to his oldest issue who was crowned Paulo III. Paulo inherited a stable Imperium and dedicated his reign to the maintenance of peace. The Meson Rebellion of 1032 on Khikaba took 12 years to put down by depleted naval forces but the outcome was never in doubt and the sentiments expressed by the rebels were kept from spreading to neighboring star systems. By 1045, Imperial intelligence agents had ferreted out the last remnants of the Phoenix Project, a Solomani resistance movement on Terra. The Imperial occupation force ingratiated itself with the locals by participating in relief, preservation and reconstruction programs. The occupiers sought to integrate themselves with Terran culture, becoming Terrans themselves as best they could. By 1050, all remaining fringe resistance movements had been brought to the negotiating table and pacified. This event was celebrated by the reestablishment of the Solomani Guard Regiment on Capital. Paulo wanted his time as Emperor to be remembered as another glorious period of peace and economic growth. Any problems that came up were handled as efficiently as possible and without fanfare.

Paulo’s wife Elbet gave birth to their first child, Strephon Aella Alkhalikoi, in 1049. At the age of 58, Paulo was old for a first-time parent but he was far from a doting one. Strephon was the heir that the Imperium demanded but he meant little else to his father. Strephon’s sister, Lydia, was born three years later in 1052 and was equally neglected. Unfortunately, Empress Elbet died under mysterious circumstances in 1053, leaving her two toddlers motherless. Paulo’s brother, James, was implicated in Elbet’s death but committed suicide within the year, before he could be properly tried for his involvement. With their mother dead and their father indisposed with the burdens of rulership, Strephon and Lydia did not even have each other to rely on, as they lived very separate lives and were only brought together when Imperial events required it. The two were raised more by their tutors than any member of the Imperial family.

One of the final acts of Paulo’s reign was the completion of the Second Grand Survey in 1065. The 75-year project was completed in the Reference system when data from the survey was downloaded to newly installed TL15 computer substrates on the planet. The transportation of all new relics and artefacts to the Reference archives was completed by 1068. Paulo basked in the glory of his achievements, having stewarded the Imperium through difficult post-war years. He died a contented man in 1071.

# Strephon Ascendant

Unlike so many of his predecessors in the Alkhalikoi line, Strephon was ill-prepared for the throne. Serving as a midshipman in the Imperial Navy, Strephon was called home when his father had been reported ill; he arrived on Capital three days after his father’s death. Only 21 years old at the time of his coronation, Strephon had a lot of catching up to do. He had hoped to have an illustrious naval career before ascending to the throne but fate dictated otherwise. He spent his early years as Emperor learning what he would need to know to rule wisely. Unlike many of his ancestors, Strephon had very little tutelage from his predecessor.

Hoping to produce an heir more promptly than his father had, Strephon married Iolanthe Guuilbataashullibaa in 1079. Iolanthe was the daughter of the senior duke of Gushemege and reaffirmed the commitment of the Alkhalikoi line to incorporate Vilani blood into its heritage. Times had changed. When Zhakirov married Antiama exactly 400 years earlier, the powerful Solomani bloc in the Moot were up in arms. The Solomani Rim War and subsequent Authentic Movement had changed the Imperial mindset. At long last the Imperium had come to terms with its complex historical legacy.

Better educated, and by many accounts more intelligent than her husband, Iolanthe became a close partner and valuable counsel. Strephon was lucky to have her. His reign was about to face its first major challenge. An incident at the Quar system of the Spinward Marches in 1082 sparked the Fourth Frontier War, resulting in numerous naval battles in Jewell and Cronor. Its final conflict was the Battle of Two Suns, fought in the depths of space between the Yres and Menorb systems. Losses to both sides were so devastating that both Imperium and Zhodani Consulate forces sued for peace. The fighting lasted only 18 months before an armistice was signed in 1084, causing the war to be nicknamed the ‘False War’. By the time word had arrived at Capital, the fighting was essentially over. Nevertheless, clever messaging was devised to make Strephon look like a highly capable commander-in-chief. As had so often been the case with the Frontier Wars, a few systems changed hands and things returned to the status quo.

A few short years after the war, the Emperor and Empress produced an heir to the throne. Ciencia Iphegenia, Grand Princess of the Imperium, was born in 1088, extending the Alkhalikoi Line.

## 1105

There are pregnant moments in history that, unbeknownst to those living in them, are on the verge of unleashing a torrent of changes and events that will reshape the very fabric of society, redefining and rearranging things so drastically that they became virtually unrecognizable thereafter. The year 1105 is just such a moment. The Imperium is about to experience a number of events that will forever change it.

The tension between the Imperium, the Zhodani and their Outworld Coalition allies has shown no signs of abating. The Imperium hopes to be prepared for subsequent Frontier Wars better than it has been before. There is reason for hope. The Imperial Navy is devising plans that should guarantee the security of the Domain of Deneb. However, it will require strong and capable leaders to carry it out. Duke Norris Aella Aledon of Regina might be just the man for the job. The Emperor sees a kindred spirit in the Duke and hopes to make his acquaintance eventually. Strephon is less inclined towards the senior Duchess of the Marches, Delphine Adoriana Muudashir. Born in 979, the august Duchess Delphine was a child during the Solomani Rim War and was knighted to the Order of Starship and Crown in 1018 by Strephon’s grandfather, Gavin. Regardless of their shared history, Strephon and Delphine have little in common. He has privately remarked that she seems a bit too devoted to her protégé, Admiral Frederick Santanocheev. Now, nearly 126 years old, the duchess’ ambitions seem to be at odds with those of Norris.

The Domain of Deneb is the future of the Imperium and Strephon means to serve it and its people far better than previous Emperors have. The first Alkhalikoi came from Rhylanor in the Spinward Marches and Strephon intends to honor the memory of Arbellatra by being a better custodian of his ancestral homeland. To this end, Imperial naval strategists have adopted a new ‘elastic defense’ strategy in which colonial reserves are strengthened and more powerful reinforcements are stationed nearby in Corridor. Should another Frontier War occur, the colonial forces need only hold on until messengers can retrieve the larger, more powerful fleet elements from Corridor, which will arrive in the nick of time to vanquish the enemy. The Imperium has also committed to the concept of the battle rider, sublight capital ships attached to massive jump tenders. By not installing jump drives on these spacecraft, they can be packed with more ammunition and weaponry than jump-capable naval ships.

The pace of innovation is reaching new levels. Several Imperial worlds are now striving to achieve TL16. The naval weapons research facility on Sabsee has developed a more powerful small arm: the FGMP-16. On Ye-lu and Celetron, experiments in artificial intelligence are creating fully independent systems and robots that promise to bring new levels of processing speed and efficiency to Imperial worlds. Imperial Research Station Zeta on Pashus in Deneb is close to making a breakthrough in jump technology. Meanwhile, Vincennes, also in Deneb, has standardised at TL16, particularly in the realms of communications and electronics.

> [!info]- LONGBOW II
> Unbeknownst to the rank and file of the Imperium, Emperor Strephon commissioned the highly confidential Project Longbow II in 1103. The previous Longbow had a much smaller scope. This new phase of the project professes to use the entire width of the Imperium as its long baseline, using jump-6 couriers to carry collected data to Depot in Lishun.

Elsewhere there are other problems to contend with. While the Battle of Terra ended the Solomani Rim War a century ago and the Imperium has done a fine job of integrating the worlds that it conquered, the enemy is only a few parsecs away. While the Solomani are still technologically inferior to the Imperium, there are highly motivated zealots within their ranks. It would be unwise to underestimate them. There is unfinished business in the Solomani Rim and it remains to be seen which side has the vitality and determination to win should another major conflict arise in the region. Since 1095, the Solomani Party has again been allowed to operate on Terra. Considered a dangerous move by some, the Imperium believes that after a century, the occupied worlds have learned the benefits of Imperial membership. Greater pluralism has been allowed so that peace may continue.

While the Imperium has its jump-4 x-boat network, and the navy its jump-6 courier system to communicate urgent issues, Emperor Strephon still fears a fragmentation of the empire. Cleon’s dream of a loyal, honorable and dutiful feudal nobility seems to be working as intended but there is reason to be concerned. Strephon is afraid that the disparate regions of the Imperium desire more localised government to better serve their needs. He is staunchly committed to a unified empire and seeks ways to enhance the bonds that the domains have with Capital. To this end, he has appointed progressive archdukes such as Dulinor Astrin Ilethian, men and women who he believes share his vision and know how best to serve their domains, all the while maintaining their commitment to the Imperium as a whole.
