SPINWARD SALVAGE LIC



Since the corporation's inception after the [[Third Frontier War]], Spinward Salvage soon realised that there were a lot of wrecked spacecrafts and vehicles in Jewell subsector left behind after the conflict. Most notably, the battle that had taken place and around [[Nakege]] had left behind so much salvage Spinward Salvage decided it would be easier to establish a base of operations there rather than move all of the wreckage to more distant facilities.

Spinward Salvage LIC took ownership of [[Nakege]] and[[ Nakege]] II in 988, after negotiating salvage rights with the indigenous population who had survived on [[Nakege]]. Although not ideal, establishing salvage yards on [[Nakege II]] kept their transport costs down and the corporation soon prospered, making good profits from their sales of scrap, spare parts and refurbished ships.
