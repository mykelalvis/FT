### MORNINGLORI

Morninglori is named for its spectacular sky views.
The mainworld is a gas giant satellite, with the giant planet visible in the sky even in daytime. Reflected light from the giant makes true darkness very rare on Morninglori, although periods of very dim twilight occur every rotation. The day/twilight cycle is very rapid, making a traditional work in the day/rest at night lifestyle meaningless. The inhabitants' lives are keyed

to artificial light indoors and clocks set to the standard Imperial day. Words like 'tomorrow' can confuse newcomers, as they can refer either to the standard Imperial day or the next full daylight period, depending on inflection and context.

Parts of Morninglori remain unexplored, with the 100 thousand or so population centered around the port and nearby small cities. Whilst a very pretty planet, Morninglori is unimportant in the grand scheme of sector politics. It 'missed the boat' during the early expansion of the region and today remains a backwater whose modest exports of agricultural goods are insufficient to buy the world a place on the interstellar stage. This is to the liking of most residents, who simply want to get on with their daily lives and let the universe go by.
