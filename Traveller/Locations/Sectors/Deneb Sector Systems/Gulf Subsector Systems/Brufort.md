# BRUFORT

Brufort is a system located near the borders of the [[Duchy of Zeng]]. It is a temperate world with a breathable atmosphere and habitable without need for additional technology or resources. Most landmasses rest along the planet's equator, leading to frequent tropical temperatures and a wide range of lush jungles and heavy rainfall. The oceans make up a majority of the planetary surface and like the landmasses they are diverse in native lifeforms, although none have evolved sapience. There are some life forms dangerous to sophonts, notably terrestrial and aquatic predators, but the most perilous creatures are large swarms of dangerous insects.

Brufort was registered by the Scout Services in [[IY0281]] but was not settled until after the [[Civil War]] in 654. A survey uncovered many valuable resources but the most notable was the presence of natural pockets of [[Zuchai crystals]] in the mountains and under the ocean surface. An independent mining conglomerate staked claim on the mining rights and sent teams to Brufort to set up operations but they quickly discovered that the local fauna made settlement problematic. Crimson locusts were the biggest problem and early settlers were forced to remain in sealed habitation modules and use vacc suits to travel outside to avoid attacks by the near-constant swarms. This made mining the planet's resources a slow and risky process and life for the colonists was miserable as they remained huddled in cramped habitats while surrounded by a scenic tropical paradise. The mining conglomerate cut their losses and gave up their claim on the planet but many of the miners decided to stay behind to try to find a way to tap into Brufort's lucrative bounty.

It took many years but in time the miners were able to enlist the aid of a group of entomologists to help find a solution to the crimson locust problem. Pesticides were not effective due to the locusts' hardy biology and rapid breeding, and they remained a persistent danger during the entire year thanks to balmy temperatures in most habitable areas of the planet. They were able to determine that the insects cannot tolerate a particular infrasonic frequency, which can be used to drive them off. The colonists invested in large transmitters to broadcast infrasound in large 'bubbles' around their settlements and at agriculture and mining locations, allowing them to live a relatively normal life. They were still confined to areas covered by the infrasound but at least they could enjoy the warm climate and breathe non-recycled air. It also allowed them to expand their settlements and operations, and this brought trade to Brufort thanks to the bountiful [[Zuchai crystals]] and ores mined from the planet.

Without the influence of large mining corporations, Brufort has managed to divert most income from trade back to the planet and the people. The mines have always been employee owned and local brokers facilitate trade with other systems. The ideology to keep

Brufort outside the turmoil of the rest of the sector has expanded into attitudes within government. Like the other systems in the [[Gulf subsector]], Brufort is not under the dominion of any of the sector dukes, instead governed by a loose council of representatives elected by the general population, overseen by a planetary regent who holds the rank of knight. The current regent is a Solomani man named Betrus Phirric, elected to the position five years ago after serving as a trade broker for the mines. Because it exists on the fringes of the sector politics of Deneb, Brufort has enjoyed more freedom than most Imperial worlds. As long as they continue to pay taxes and follow established trade regulations, the people of Brufort stay under the radar and have enjoyed little interference from the politics of Deneb.

For its brief history Brufort has been a planet where the inhabitants needed to balance risk versus reward. The bounty offered by the planet's rich resources is counterbalanced by the constant danger of the crimson locusts, so only the hardiest and most determined have been willing to take the risk. Even in current times the people of Brufort are hard-working and close knit, knowing their livelihood and survival rest on the backs of each other. They live in a veritable paradise denied to them because of hostile fauna but the people are generally good natured and fond of local traditions and celebrations to mark their history. The settlements embrace their working class roots and fight hard to keep the industries fuelling the economy in the hands of locals whose lineage dates back to some of the earliest settlers. While the people of Brufort are not hostile to outsiders, they are slow to trust. This attitude has kept the planet free from outside influence for many years but also gives rise to feelings of mistrust and fears that one day Brufort would be seen as too lucrative a prize for outside influences to ignore.

## Caelestis

[[LstDuke-295.jpg|Caelestis]]

Isolated settlements dot the landmasses of Brufort but none are as large and developed as the city of [[#Caelestis]]. Built upon the site of the original colony, it is home to over 800,000 people within the confines of its six metre plascrete walls. While most of the populace is Solomani and Vilani, there are small communities of [[Aslan]] and a few dozen [[Martian]]s  who travelled there to work the mines. [[#Caelestis]] has always maintained a strong sense of community and while outsiders are treated with caution, once they acclimate to the city the locals treat them as one of their own.

The city is divided up into four different districts, each of which is separated by a four metre plascrete wall.

### The Neighbourhood

The largest and oldest part of [[#Caelestis]], the district known as the Neighbourhood was part of the original settlement and was home to one of the first major mining operations. The community grew around the old mine and expanded as more people arrived. It remains home to the majority of workers for the mining companies and local businesses, and the frequent expansions to the protective walls have given the Neighbourhood a maze-like appearance from above. Many of the former open-pit mines have been converted to small, tiered rows of residences with small parks sitting at the bottom and one of the oldest mine shafts serves as tenements for the less fortunate and a good hiding place for those seeking to avoid the authorities. Businesses in the Neighbourhood are limited to small cafes, street service eateries and a few stores selling basic sundries and clothing.

#### Last Refuge

A plain three-storey building with a simple sign beside the door and a few tables and chairs set up outside for guests. Inside there is a small desk and a bell, and the owner, a middle-aged woman named [[Danease Garber]], can usually be found there or sitting outside enjoying a cup of coffee. She is far more friendly than most of the city's populace, inviting the Travellers to stay for a modest rate of Cr50 per night. If they agree she shows them to one of the large rooms that can accommodate up to six people. The rooms are sparse but functional, with three sets of bunk beds, a small sink and a curtained off area with a cramped shower and toilet. [[#Danease Garber|Danease]] also offers them simple but hearty meals from her own kitchen for a price of Cr10 per meal but can also direct them to several nearby eateries if they want a change of pace.

### Seaside

Resting along the coastline, the Seaside district is home to docks that service the offshore mining and fishing industries. It also houses facilities to help build and maintain the equipment and ships helping to sustain those industries, and warehouses storing goods until they are ready to be transported. While this makes Seaside a busy place, in recent years there has been a push to make the district a hub for shopping and other commercial business ventures. A section of the old docks has been converted into quaint eateries, boutiques and bars for locals to unwind and find goods imported from off world. This effort was stymied by the more restrictive regulations put in place by the security forces, which have limited import of goods and tourism.

### The Stacks

As the hub for mining operations on Brufort, [[#Caelestis]] requires facilities to help process crystals and raw ore. The mining companies centralised processing plants and mills in one district known as the Stacks with its tall cooling towers and smoke stacks that dominate the skyline. The Stacks are one of the busiest districts in the city, with the facilities running day and night during peak production times. There are also special storage facilities housing [[Zuchai crystals]] due to their fragility and value, and the security forces have a strong presence here.

### Regency

Home to [[#Office of the Regent|government offices]] and administrative sites for the mining companies, the district known as the Regency is integral to the daily functioning of [[#Caelestis]].  The Regency is also home to the wealthy of [[#Caelestis]], primarily the families that own majority shares of the mining companies. The district also has high-end shops and restaurants to cater to those of means or those who pretend they have means.

#### Office of the Regent
The Office of the Regent is the central location for the ruling council and they conduct weekly meetings to discuss policy and the needs of Brufort. It is also home to the bureaucratic machine keeping day-to-day life going within the city, issuing permits to mining companies to survey new sites and determining the infrastructure to keep the city functioning. 

### Starport
There is also a Class C starport 10 kilometres outside the city and this serves as the hub for all offworld travel. It is linked to the city by a single road that passes through the crimson locust infested jungles, although a series of transmitters along the road keep it safe for travel. The starport is a basic facility designed to cater to transport ships used to haul away ore and crystals as well as those bringing in goods to the planet. While Brufort would benefit from income generated by tourism, few want to travel there unless they have business to conduct.

[[Crimson Locusts]]

# Mining Companies

There are currently three mining companies on Brufort, each focusing on a specific resource to maximise operations without leading to conflict over rights. They are run by local families and employees traditionally own stock so they have a vested interest in the welfare of their operations. As the lifeblood of the planet, the mining companies are vital to the welfare of Brufort and its people.

## Brufort Mining Group

Dating back to the original miners who arrived on planet, the Brufort Mining Group is the oldest and largest mining company. They started mines in what is now known as [[#the Neighbourhood]] district and have multiple sites outside [[#[[#Caelestis]]]], focusing on metals and [[Zuchai crystals]]. Brufort Mining Group is run by the Rother family and the board of directors is headed by Justis Rother and his wife Llyla.

## Morskoi Offshore Drilling

The vast oceans of Brufort conceal many valuable resources and as settlement of the planet expanded the Phillic family arrived to bring their successful offshore business to [[#Caelestis]]. Morskoi reaps the fossil fuels found deep under the planet's oceans and also provides unrefined hydrogen used by ships coming to the planet.

## Saso Mines

Founded in the last 50 years, Saso is the newest and smallest of the mining groups on Brufort. Saso's interests are diamonds and [[Zuchai crystals]] not claimed by the [[#Brufort Mining Group]], both valuable for manufacture and starship operations. The Saso family has come under fire in the last year for alleged mistreatment of their workers and this has put them at odds with the close knit communities on Brufort.

# Exploring Brufort

This adventure takes place in [[#Caelestis]] but Travellers might want to explore other locations prior to arriving in the city or after their task is complete. Most of the planet is unexplored and unsettled, with pockets of civilisation near [[#Caelestis]] or on small islands close by. There are ample opportunities to explore the wilds of the planet as long as the Travellers are able to avoid the crimson locusts and other dangers lurking within the jungles. Those looking for more civil surroundings can visit one of these other locations on the planet.

## The Nines

Once known as Mining Survey Site 9, the town called The Nines became a meeting place for workers of surrounding mines. The original site's storage facility was converted into a makeshift bunkhouse and the old equipment building was turned into a bar called the Drill Pit. Workers bring in libations and food from their camps at the mines or partake of whatever dubious concoction is brewing inside the stills at the back of the bar. The Nines is a rough place at the quietest of times but when the miners are off duty it turns into a raucous party only the hardest can survive. In recent years the miners have added additional infrasound generators cobbled together from outdated models provided by the mining companies, and this has led to more permanent residents seeking a place away from the current troubles in [[#Caelestis]]. As yet none of the mining companies has made issue with The Nines but there may come a time when they decide to reclaim the site and put it to more productive use.

## Site 14

[[#Saso Mines]] was the first company to survey some of the outlying islands surrounding the main continent and they struck paydirt at Site 14. This small volcanic landmass has extensive veins of [[Zuchai crystals]] and valuable gemstones buried deep beneath its rock, and they have started operations to capitalise on the bounty. Unfortunately the island is also geologically unstable, with frequent seismic activity disrupting mines and endangering miners. There has also been data indicating there is a risk the volcano will soon erupt but Saso has invested too much into Site 14 to abandon it. The miners are aware of the dangers but are willing to take the risk because they reap the rewards alongside their employer.

## The Ring

One of [[#Morskoi Offshore Drilling|Morskoi's]] offshore rigs found a rich deposit of metals under the ocean 30 kilometres off the coast of [[#Caelestis]]. To capitalise on this discovery they built several more around the initial platform, forming a ring of facilities working to bring up as much ore as possible. As the deposit began to dry up they converted the rigs to gather ocean water and Morskoi added refining facilities so they could begin producing starship fuel for export. Now known as the Ring, these sites remain an important part of Morskoi's operations and as the company grows its fuel production they will require contacts off Brufort. Unbeknownst to Morskoi, a small group of workers on the Ring have begun harvesting a local form of jellyfish containing substances that act as a powerful narcotic in humans. These illicit entrepreneurs are also looking for someone to help them distribute their new drug off Brufort but they are also fearful that Morskoi will find out what they are doing and are very protective of their operation.

## The Ghost Site

Survey Site 42 was the furthest the [[#Brufort Mining Group]] had set up operations from [[#Caelestis]] at the time of its construction but initial data suggested it had the potential to be a lucrative location. The company invested heavily in establishing the mining site, bringing in cutting edge equipment and sending some of their best workers. For several months the data proved to be correct and they pulled vast amounts of raw [[Zuchai crystals]] from the mines. Then all contact with the site went silent. Crews were sent out to investigate and what they found was troubling; equipment and buildings were intact but none of the workers were there. There were no signs of violence or bodies and nothing in the personal logs of the crew suggested any cause for the mass disappearance. The infrasound emitters were fully functional and investigators could not find evidence in the jungles around the site of workers leaving the protective bubble. The site was sealed off and the mining company remains open to anyone who wants to investigate so they can close the book on Site 42.
