# INTRODUCTION

Lying far from the Imperial core, the Deneb and Spinward Marches sectors combine hazardous frontiers with complex internal politics. It was here that the four great Frontier Wars were fought and, from here, that Admiral Plankwell launched his bid for the Imperial throne. The region is at once a crossroads and a backwater; a frontier and a hotbed of internal politics.

To rimward lies the Great Rift, one of the last unexplored areas of Charted Space. The rift’s distinctive shape, and the long haul around its coreward fringe, give this region its nickname ‘behind the Claw’. The rift limits communication with the rest of the Imperium, creating a unique cultural region with external influences almost as strong as those of the Imperial core.

The Imperial Navy is stretched thin here, defending the borders at the expense of internal security. Some systems are all but lawless; others pay only lip service to Imperial membership and pursue their own goals. Some systems have never been properly surveyed and may yet hold mysteries or hidden dangers; others are ripe for exploitation or conquest. Small wars are common; smuggling, and even piracy, are rife.

As the subsector dukes of Deneb and Spinward Marches jockey for power, and the merchant shipping lines vie for control of the spaceways, they must contend with threats both internal and external. To coreward lie the chaotic Vargr Extents, source of endless corsair raids, and the mysterious Zhodani Consulate with its psionic nobility. To spinward are open frontiers with vast possibilities for daring merchant captains and explorers.

From the ultra-tech of Vincennes to the undeveloped wastelands of Fulacin, a wealth of opportunities lie waiting behind the Claw. There are deals to be struck in seedy freeports, new trade routes to be opened and hidden resources found on remote worlds. Rebel groups need weaponry; criminal organizations want their illegal goods moved on the quiet. With so many cross-cutting political and economic agendas, there is work aplenty for mercenaries and Travellers who operate with initiative and discretion.

Hundreds of worlds offer an infinite variety of experiences. From unspoiled wilderness roamed by gigantic megafauna, to the dangerous depths of overcrowded cities; from star-baked craters of a vacuum world to unexplored jungles and lofty mountains. Those of more cultured tastes can experience the politically-
charged atmosphere of Trin, Mora and Deneb, where a cocktail party or formal dinner can have sector-wide consequences, or visit the homeworlds of the region’s many minor races.

There is endless variety to be found on the worlds behind the Claw. Danger and opportunity; the wondrous and the mundane.

An infinity of adventure awaits...

# CHARTED SPACE

Space that has been explored by humans is referred to as Charted Space. Within this region are many areas densely populated and well-travelled by starships.
Others are backwaters or have never been more than superficially mapped.

The most prevalent sentient species in Charted Space is human, and the most powerful human state is the Third Imperium, although there are many other powers, great and small, along with independent worlds and political groups.

There are few areas about which absolutely everything is known and, even if an area had been properly explored, the data may not be publicly available or the public version may be entirely incorrect. There is still plenty to be discovered, even in the settled regions of Charted Space, and beyond the core areas many mysteries await discovery.

### DIRECTIONS IN SPACE

Directions like north or southwest are meaningless in space. Within a star system, most objects move in orbit about the star or a planet and movement can be defined with reference to a suitable point. Most bodies in a star system orbit in the same general plane, known as the ecliptic. One direction at 90 degrees to the ecliptic is defined by convention as ‘system north’ or ‘up’ and the other as ‘system south’ or ‘down’.

Most movement within a system is defined in terms of going towards, or away from, a given body, usually the main world of the system or the star itself. The terms ‘in-system’ (towards the inner planets of the system and the star) or ‘out-system’ (away from the star) are also used. These are rather general terms but as navigation in three dimensions, whether along an orbital path or a straight line, is a complex business they serve for casual conversation. Of course, starship astrogators produce rather more detailed course plots using highly advanced mathematics...

Outside the confines of a star system, some frame of reference is needed to indicate relative positions. By convention the following terms are used:

- Coreward refers to the direction towards the galactic core.
- Rimward is the opposite direction to coreward, towards the galactic rim.
- Spinward means in the direction in which the galaxy is rotating.
- Trailing is the opposite of spinward; away from the direction of galactic rotation.

Some Imperial citizens also use the term coreward to mean towards the Imperial heartworlds, literally the ‘Imperial Core’. This usage is generally obvious from context. For example, it should be fairly obvious that a magazine called Coreward Gazette deals with matters in the Imperial central region and not the centre of the galaxy tens of thousands of light-years away.

#### Distances

Concepts like metres and kilometres are inadequate for the vast distances in space. Over relatively short distances, such as in orbital space, thousands or millions of kilometres are used as a measure. Larger distances in-system are measured using the Astronomical Unit, or AU. This is based on the distance of Earth’s orbit from the Sun and is about 150,000,000 km.

The light-second is also used, defined as the distance light travels within a vacuum in one second. This is 299,792.458 km, usually rounded to 300,000 km. One AU is 499 light-seconds.

Over greater distances, still larger measures are needed. The light-year (the distance light travels in one standard Earth year) is sometimes used, equating to 63,241 AU. More commonly, the parsec (3.26 light-years) is used as this is the maximum distance that can be covered by a jump-1 capable starship.

Most Traveller starmaps use a scale of 1 parsec to 1 hex.

#### Astrographic Features

Charted Space has a few anomalies and interesting features. Stars tend to occur in groups (called clusters) or long chains (known as mains). Trade and commerce tends to move along the mains as they allow vessels to navigate between systems with ease. Crossing to another main requires a ship with longer range or some means to refuel in deep space.

Many clusters and segments of a main have their own cultural, astrographic or economic identity. These are sometimes named, such as the Bowman Arm in the Spinward Marches, a segment of the Spinward Main centering on the Bowman system.

The empty space between clusters or mains is sometimes referred to as a rift. Small rifts are usually no more than 1-4 parsecs wide and hardly worthy of the name. Even the Great and Lesser Rifts of Charted Space are nothing compared to vast gulfs that can lie between the spiral arms of the galaxy. However, they are a significant navigational obstacle to vessels using jump drive technology.

A few odd features have been reported, though some may be nothing more than wild spacers’ tales. A rosette system of five equidistant worlds orbiting a common star, that could not have occurred naturally, or the rumored ringworld located in the Vargr Extents. There are also a number of broken planets and shattered moons that may indicate a war of titanic proportions in the distant past.

### MAINWORLDS

Most star systems are identified by their mainworld, the most important planet, moon or planetoid belt in the system. This is for the simple reason that people visit worlds, not stars. The mainworld of a system is usually the most habitable, but not always. It may be a moon of a gas giant or a planetoid belt, but most commonly it will be a planet of some kind.

The nature of the jump drive is such that unless there is a good (usually economic) reason to visit other worlds of a system, vessels tend to ply between mainworlds in different systems rather than less important worlds in the same system. It takes as long to jump a few hundred AU to an outsystem rockball as it does to travel to the much more important mainworld of the star system a parsec away.

For this reason, the remainder of a star system can be quite underdeveloped, although there may be outposts, mining stations and other installations, not all legal or above-board, scattered among the various bodies and planets of a system.

### STARPORTS AND SPACEPORTS

By convention, a world has only one starport but can have many spaceports. The designation "starport" is given to the world’s main port, where most commercial and passenger traffic goes. Any other port is designated a spaceport. This can cause problems on balkanised worlds where several governments exist; most will claim that their port is the main one.

Usually, but not always, the starport is the best port on the planet and others will be inferior. Normally, there will be a main port accompanied by a startown, which is often the planetary capital. The startown is usually geared to offworld visitors and doing business with other star systems, so may have more relaxed attitudes and laws than other regions of the planet. This is not always the case, however.

The Imperium considers a starport (but not usually a spaceport) as Imperial territory, so Imperial law, and not local law, applies there. In practice, there is often a compromise, with shared jurisdiction. Law Levels vary but a typical well-regulated starport tends to restrict visitors to sidearms – this may be more or less than people are permitted to own or carry outside the port.

The startown is planetary territory, not part of the port, and theoretically local law applies there. However, the startown is often a buffer zone between world and port and if there are radical differences in Law Level then sometimes the startown has a special set of laws in place within its limits.

The planetside part of a starport or spaceport is termed the downport, although there may also be an orbital component termed the highport. In some cases, this is big enough to be a city in space and there may be no need to descend to the planet at all if business can be conducted in orbit.

An important system might have a large highport serving a downport at the capital. Large ships dock at the highport and use shuttles for passenger and cargo transport; smaller vessels can land if they choose. From the orbital highport, it is possible to go to the main downport or spaceports in each of half a dozen cities, plus a commercial port serving an industrial complex.
Meanwhile there may be a dedicated military port, a small government port and a couple of spaceports serving installations on other bodies in the system, such as a mining colony on a moon of one of the gas giants.
A minor system, on the other hand, may have little more than a shed and a marked landing area.

### TRAVEL AND COMMUNICATIONS

In the Third Imperium universe there is no faster-than-light (FTL) radio or other instantaneous communications. The only way to get a message to a given point is to send a starship there. In civilised areas, a system of courier ships and express boats (Xboats) is used to maintain communications, with mail and additional information moving aboard commercial starships.

This creates a system not unlike Earth in the Age of Sail, where a vessel on a distant station might be months from home and the orders of its owners.  Colonial governors, corporate officials, lawmen and other individuals find themselves waiting for weeks if instructions are requested. Individuals must take responsibility and act as they think best.

FTL travel is possible using the jump drive. Essentially, a ship enters jumpspace and stays there, cut off from the rest of the universe for roughly a week. It then returns to normal space some distance from its starting point. A jump-1 rated ship can travel up to 1 parsec in a single jump (which always takes more or less a week, regardless of distance). Higher rated ships can cover greater distances but, despite the occasional rumor or secret prototypes and alien vessels, reliable jumps of more than 6 parsecs have not been achieved.

It is possible to travel more than 6 parsecs in a single jump but this is only one of several possible outcomes of what is known as a misjump. Misjumping can be a slight inconvenience, delaying the vessel slightly or bringing it out a few AU from its intended emergence point... or it can result in an unpredictable jump of highly variable duration and distance.

### THE TRAVELLERS’ AID SOCIETY

The Travellers’ Aid Society (TAS) maintains a chain of hostels, which vary considerably in quality from excellent hotels to drafty shacks, and provides information to its members about local conditions.  While TAS was created with the needs (and money) of well-off businesspersons and minor nobles in mind, it has gradually come to cater to a more ordinary voyager. Anyone can rent a room in most TAS facilities but the Member’s Lounge and special facilities (which generally include accurate and up to date local information on what is really going on) are reserved for members.

Membership can be awarded for service or, as cynics claim, for being someone TAS would like to have as a member. It can also be bought for a straight MCr1, although some candidates are blackballed after paying, for various reasons.

TAS publishes JTAS – the Journal of the Travellers’ Aid Society. This is a well-respected news and current events journal, with features on interesting people and places across Charted Space. The ‘open’ version can be bought by anyone and helps fund reporters and the society itself. Members have access to a slightly more comprehensive version with the JTAS archives, which are very extensive and contain information on a wide range of subjects.

TAS is not a secret society, nor is it a ‘universal siblinghood of Travellers’. There is no guarantee that an influential person staying in a TAS hostel will talk to a down-at-heel adventurer just because they are both TAS members. However, it provides a place where interesting, and perhaps useful, people can be met if a Traveller makes the right approach. Sometimes job offers and information come through the TAS network and are not seen by outsiders.

Overall, TAS is very useful to Travellers. Whether it is worth spending a million Credits on is another question entirely.

> [!info] Bases Behind the Claw
> The most common bases in the Imperium are detailed on page 227 of the Traveller Core Rulebook , but several others can be found in the Spinward Marches and Deneb, and are marked in the subsector descriptions later in this book.
>
> Depot (D): Used by the Imperium’s sector fleets, a depot is a massive naval base, often consuming an entire star system. It can support a sizeable fraction of a sector fleet’s ships at once, offering building, repairing, rearming and experimental facilities. As well as servicing ships, depots also have command and control facilities, academies, and mothballed ships.
>
> Corsair Base (C): Popularised by Vargr, corsair bases do not have the full range of facilities of naval bases but provide enough to refuel and maintain corsair ships. A corsair base is often the main staging point from which raids are conducted.
>
> Military Base (M): These are planetary facilities for the support, maintenance, repair and refit of ground vehicles and troops.
>
> Way Station (W): A large Imperial Interstellar Scout Service installation dedicated to the x-boat communication network and servicing scout ships.
>
> Zhodani Base (Z): Zhodani bases are a combination of naval bases and the equivalent of x-boat stations (serviced by jump-4 couriers).

There are no reliable reports of a vessel surviving a misjump that carried it more than 36 parsecs, although there are the usual wild spacers’ tales. It is assumed that those vessels that misjumped and were not seen again were destroyed, and it is known that some vessels have been destroyed by misjump accidents as evidence found in the debris has shown.

### THE ANCIENTS

Little is known about the Ancients and it is probable that most of what is known is inaccurate. Various theories have been put forward, most of which have insurmountable flaws. Most scientists agree that the Ancients reached the height of their power several hundred thousand years ago and their disappearance coincides with a fair amount of damage to Charted Space; there are several asteroid belts and devastated worlds dating from that period. The most popular explanation is that they fought each other, or someone else, to mutual destruction.

Various Ancient devices and sites have been found, along with larger numbers of mistaken and outright fraudulent finds. Trade in Ancient artefacts is heavily restricted but there are always those who will pay Credits for a working item.

The Ancients are thought to have been responsible for transplanting many species, including humans and Vargr. They may have terraformed worlds, or seeded them with life, and are probably responsible for the presence of Terran plants and animals on worlds only now being charted by humans.

The wonders of the Ancients are mostly lost and those found are often incomprehensible. Devices are discovered that have no known function and those that can be used remain mysterious. The Ancients and their technology are something of a modern superstition; any unexplained phenomenon tends to be blamed on the Ancients.

# SPINWARD MARCHES

To the average citizen of the Imperial core worlds, the Spinward Marches is just a name, one of the distant provinces perhaps, or one of those troublesome backward border regions. Certainly, nothing good ever seems to come out of the Marches. The Civil War was launched from there; major conflicts with foreign states are two-a-Credit... and, in any case, the Marches are on the other side of the Great Rift, very far away and of no real consequence.

There is an element of truth in this. The Marches are isolated not only by distance but by the barrier of the Great Rift, which cannot be crossed without considerable effort. As a result, the only way into, and out of, the Marches is through the narrow Imperial-held strip between the Great Rift and Vargr Extents, aptly named the Corridor sector.

On top of that, the Spinward Marches is the Imperial border with the Zhodani Consulate and several smaller human, Vargr and other states. As a result, it was bound to have an interesting history. Most events in the Marches affect only the local area but, occasionally, something spills out, usually something bad – that is just how the universe works.

To a great extent, astrography dictates many of the characteristics of the sector. The single most important feature is the Spinward Main, which wends its way right across the sector, branching at several points. The Spinward Main is often considered to begin at Mora; in fact the chain of stars runs onward into the Star Lane subsector of Deneb for a couple of parsecs.

From Mora, an arm of the Main runs coreward into Rhylanor but the Main proper is far longer. One of the major arms run coreward into Aramis and Regina, then across spinward all the way to Querion. The central arm runs through the Sword Worlds to Darrian, while the rimward arm splits into three major branches. One leads to Glisten and two run into the Five Sisters.

The most important implication of this huge astrographical feature is that it is possible to reach any subsector of the Marches with a jump-1 ship, albeit slowly. A jump-2 ship can reach almost any world in the sector by following the Main then jumping across onto a smaller main. Only a handful of worlds cannot be reached in this way.

There are a few areas of very sparse systems in the Marches, which tend to channel and restrict shipping.  One is in Aramis but lies close to the border so has little effect on internal shipping. Rather more important is the sparse area in the Vilis and Lanth subsectors. Not only is this a region of low stellar density, which restricts easy navigation, but it is associated with a number of curious phenomena; the incidence of misjumps and ship disappearances in what is known as the Abyss Rift is significantly higher than in other areas. The region of sparse systems extends out to spinward from Vilis but, as there is no Imperial territory in this direction, it is of little consequence.

The other region of low stellar density lies to spinward-coreward of Collace, in District 268, and is known as the Collace Rift. Arms of the Spinward Main run around the edges of this rift, which contains the barely-surveyed world designated 875-496 and the interdicted Droyne worlds of Andor and Candory.

Politically, there are few barriers to navigation in most of the sector. The Sword Worlds Confederation is not friendly to the Imperium, which necessitates a detour around Sword Worlder space for most ships headed to the Darrian Confederation. Difficulty of access also means that Imperial holdings in the Five Sisters are more or less cut off from the rest of the Imperium.

Obviously, crossing the border into the Zhodani Consulate presents significant problems, as Imperial ships are not always welcomed there, and the same applies to the Sword Worlds Confederation. Ships coming into the Imperium from these states are sometimes considered suspect by the Imperial Navy and the worlds they visit.

However, the Imperial border is not a hard barrier. It is simple enough to leave Imperial space, visit worlds outside the Imperium, and later return, and no special permissions are needed. While the Imperium has laws that govern trade between member worlds, these do not apply to systems outside the Imperium and those systems have their own regulations. Thus, although crossing the border is easy, the way ships are treated by local authorities when they make planetfall can be a disincentive to cross-border trading.

Above all, it is important to note that each world, whether part of the Imperium or not, is different and self-governing. The Imperium is a framework that establishes common concepts and laws, and otherwise leaves worlds to their own devices, so there are large cultural differences between many of the worlds of the Imperium. Beyond its borders this is even more pronounced, although only the most isolated worlds are not affected in some way by the values and ideas that exist elsewhere in the universe.

![[BtC-5062.jpg]]

## HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE

To understand why the sector is the way it is, it is necessary to look back over its long and somewhat troubled history.

It seems that the Ancients were active in the Spinward Marches, as is evidenced by the transplanted Terran species; various animals and plants native to Terra and other distant worlds were found in the region when human exploration began. There were also humans living in the area; the Daryen people, for one, and the rather more powerful Zhodani.

There are also some interesting anomalies. Several Ancients sites and many artefacts have been located, and the Ancients are thought to have been somehow responsible for Shionthy being an asteroid belt; there is strong evidence that it was a planet until, in cosmological terms, quite recently.

However, little is known about ancient times in the Marches. Archaeologists uncover new data from time-to-time but the work is intermittent and piecemeal. Evidence has been found of non-human civilizations dating from the distant past but which are not thought to be associated with the Ancients. Perhaps time and research will make this clearer.

In the meantime, it is known that the Ancients were here at some point and they did a number of things that suggest a lengthy stay. They are gone now. Beyond that, everything is a matter for conjecture.

Information about the Zhodani is hard to come by and not always reliable, but it seems they arrived on their homeworld (Zhdant) about 300,000 years ago. They were brought from Terra by the Ancients, who settled them and undertook a range of incomprehensible acts including remodelling mountains and cutting, then refilling, ocean trenches. They also reportedly built a city on the moon of Zhdant.

Soon afterwards, perhaps as little as a few hundred years, Zhdant came under severe orbital bombardment. It is thought that the Ancient cities and other sites were destroyed using several hundred megatons of nuclear explosives, as well as deadfall ordnance (objects dropped from orbit as kinetic weapons) and other unidentified weapons. Modern Zhodani are descended from a few tens of thousands of survivors, who were cast back to barbarism. There are no records of survivors among the Ancients.

### The Zhodani Consulate

Over the next tens of thousands of years, the Zhodani struggled to survive an ice age triggered by the bombardment and, as conditions improved, began to spread out across the planet. By approximately -24000 (by the modern Imperial calendar), the Zhodani had evolved into their modern form and became increasingly reliant on agriculture rather than nomadic hunting.

Imperial scientists believe that there was once a large population of Chirpers on Zhdant. They might have been put there by the Ancients or could have been native. In either case, human contact resulted in the discovery that these Chirpers had psionic abilities. Zhodani humans may or may not have gained their initial insight into psionics from the Chirper population; what is known is that from the time humans and Chirpers encountered one another, Zhodani humans began to display psionic abilities.

Zhodani sources are vague about the Chirpers; they all died out during recorded history. There is also evidence that around -8000, the Zhodani suffered massive depopulation, probably due to a plague. There may be a connection between these events.

Civilization was rebuilt slowly and not without difficulty.
However, by -6731 a technological society existed on Zhdant. This was the date of the first Psionic Games, the beginning of modern Zhodani society. The Psionic Games established a path for a psionically talented commoner to join the nobility and helped find the most powerful psionic individuals in each generation.
The period between games (three local years) is still a fundamental concept in Zhodani society.

The Zhodani are thought to have begun (some sources say regained, which has interesting implications) space travel around -6400. Within 400 years, they were launching sublight exploration missions to neighboring systems.
The Zhodani were willing to undertake very long-term operations; they created colonies in several systems and sent out exploration ships on missions lasting decades.
The Zhodani Consulate was founded in -5823 and comprised worlds as far as four parsecs from Zhdant.

In -5415 the Zhodani developed jump drive technology and rapidly expanded their territory, encountering sentient species along the way. They met the Vargr around -2800 and the Vilani in about -2000. However, Zhodani exploration was unusual in one very significant way; they were fascinated by the galactic core.

Since -4000, the Zhodani have launched seven major, and many more minor, Core Expeditions. These have gradually pushed towards the galactic core, establishing a chain of refuelling and repair bases, and establishing relations with species met along the way.

The expeditions are limited to a region of about 30 parsecs wide, with occasional offshoots, and extend over 8,000 parsecs. Imperial scientists do not know the purpose of these missions but suggest, given the time and expense involved, they must be considered very important.

The Zhodani Consulate expanded rapidly from -4000 to
-1000, at which point it halted. Unlike the Imperium, there is no ‘border creep’; the Consulate has been stable for two thousand years. According to the Zhodani, it has reached the largest size that can be effectively governed and further expansion is both unnecessary and counterproductive.

Although it holds a few worlds in the Spinward Marches, the Zhodani Consulate did not push into the sector and thus had a stable border when later arrivals appeared on the scene.

### The Rise and Fall of the Darrians

Meanwhile, another transplanted group of humans was becoming active in the region. Like the Zhodani, the Darrians were settled on a habitable world by the Ancients, for reasons unknown, and then abandoned when the Ancients departed. Darrian was a very habitable world and there was less impetus to develop technology than elsewhere. The Darrians developed slowly and peacefully.

Many centuries later, in -1520, while the Rule of Man was declining into the Long Night, a fleet of ships belonging to a Terran corporation arrived at Darrian, seeking a new home. They befriended the Darrians rather than competing with them, and by -1400 a synthesis of the two cultures emerged. This had the best features of both groups; the energy and inquisitiveness of the Terrans, fused with the intellectual nature of the Darrians to create a technologically advanced yet ethical society.

They were capable of interbreeding and within 400 years there was only one Darrian race and culture. Moreover, it possessed TL16 technology – higher than the Imperium itself. However, this was the Darrians’ undoing. They began to experiment on Tanis, Darrian’s sun, in -1000 and in -924 the star destabilized.

It is thought that the event known as _Mahgiz_ (Chaos, in the Darrian language), was caused by an experimental probe sent into the star, causing a series of massive solar flares to erupt. These were accompanied by a huge electromagnetic pulse (EMP), which radiated out from the star at lightspeed.

The pulse did no physical damage but destroyed electronics. At a stroke, factories, hospitals, businesses and starships lost their electronics systems. Vehicles crashed, automated systems went out of control and communications disappeared. The pulse was followed by a wavefront of stellar gas moving more slowly and, three weeks after the EMP, Darrian was devastated by fire from space, which killed over 80% of the population and effectively destroyed civilization on the planet.

Although the gas dissipated in the Darrian system, the EMP struck other systems as it radiated outwards. With some warning, it was possible to preserve electronic systems from the worst effect but the heart had been torn out of the Darrian civilization. Without the technology and industry of the homeworld, there was no way to replace or maintain technological items, such as the starships possessed by the Darrian colonies.

In -905, the Darrians began taking measures to ensure long-term survival. Starships were placed in storage and each colony looked inward, preparing to survive the difficult times ahead. By -860, the Darrians had ceased all space travel.

Over the next six centuries the world of Mire gradually climbed back up to TL10 and began constructing starships. Its cache of surviving vessels were refurbished and the Darrians returned to the stars. In -275 they began exploring nearby space. What they found was both surprising and ominous.

### Newcomers in the Marches

Settlers set out from Terra and other worlds throughout the Interstellar Wars and Rule of Man. Some used cryogenic suspension, others attempted to use generation ships. Most had jump-capable vessels. The fate of many will never be known and there are almost certainly still a number of sublight vessels filled with now-dead frozen colonists headed into the unknown.

However, the fate of some missions was less grim. One such reached the world now named Gram, in the Sword Worlds subsector, and founded a colony in -399. This group comprised mainly of North Europeans from Terra and, possibly due to difficult times early on, developed a rather unique culture based on an idealised version of Icelandic and Scandinavian values. As the colony grew, surrounding worlds were colonized and named for swords in Terran mythology. A government of sorts, based on the world of Sacnoth and known as the Sacnoth Dominate, eventually emerged.

In -164 the Sword Worlders, as they were now known, encountered the re-emerging Darrians, to mutual surprise.
The two cultures were very different; the Darrians were egalitarian and intellectual, the Sword Worlders chauvinistic, obsessed with personal honor and, above all, far too ‘manly’ for their own good. Cultural and occasionally military conflict flared between the Darrians and Sword Worlders, which has never really ceased.

However, the Sword Worlders spent most of their time bickering among themselves, and by -102 the Sacnoth Dominate had broken into rebellion. The subsequent period of civil war caused all interstellar government among the Sword Worlds to collapse by -80. Each of the Sword Worlds went its own way, forming local alliances or honoring old debts of honor for past assistance but never forming a single government. There were many attempts, some violent, but none achieved success.

Another influence on the region, albeit a minor one, was exerted by the Aslan. The Aslan home region lies across the Great Rift and, although they have possessed jump drive technology for 2,000 years, the Aslan have only recently arrived in the Marches. In 585, several groups of Aslan ihatei offered to fight for the Darrian Confederation in return for grants of land. Since that time, the Darrian Confederation has had a fair sized Aslan population and recruited many thousands of Aslan troops into its armed forces.

## THE IMPERIUM IN THE MARCHES

The Third Imperium was founded in Year 0 and expanded quickly at first. After the end of the Pacification Campaigns, this changed and the Imperium as an entity was no longer concerned with expansion. It was entirely willing to accept new members, and for corporations and other bodies to launch expeditions beyond its borders, but the initial deliberate expansion had been replaced by a gradual ‘border creep’.

Expansion to coreward was curtailed by the Vargr Extents, a large area filled with small states and independent worlds with mostly Vargr populations. Major states were encountered in most other directions, or rifts created natural barriers. However, there was a narrow corridor between the coreward end of the Great Rift and the Vargr extents, and through this bottleneck the Imperium gradually expanded into the region beyond.
This area is often referred to as lying behind the claw, as the shape of the Great Rift resembles a lobster claw.

When they began exploring, early Imperial scouts found an underpopulated region that eventually led to the Sword Worlds and Darrian Confederations. These two small but developed powers lay close together, islands in a sea of unclaimed worlds. Before meeting them, however, the Imperial scouts ran into the Zhodani in Year 50. Initial contact was tentative and it was some time before the scale of the Consulate was appreciated.

After establishing a forward base at Deneb, the scouts pushed on to open up the region and behind them came traders and colonists. In the region around Deneb itself, to trailing of the Marches, expansion was rapid and many colonies received considerable investment, resulting in the creation of several economically important worlds. Movement into the Marches was slower and made in piecemeal fashion.

One of the biggest developments for the Marches was the establishment of a trading settlement at Mora. Set up by Ling Standard Products in Year 60, this was initially the far end of a long trade route through Corridor and Deneb. Over the years, it gradually developed into a forward base for trade with the new colonies of the Marches and the states encountered there.

Contact with the Sword Worlds was in 73, but it was not until 148 that the Darrians met the Imperials. During this time, the Sword Worlds managed to create a new unified government, the Triple Dominion (shared by Anduril, Colada and Dyrnwyn), which lasted from 104 to 217. It may be that the Sword Worlders deliberately

discouraged the Imperials from moving through their territory and thus meeting their Darrian rivals. Certainly, the number of scouting missions in that direction dropped rapidly.

By 200, Imperial interest in new territory, especially in distant regions that were hard to reach, had waned. Expansion in the Marches proceeded in a disjointed manner, fuelled by economics and on a small scale. The presence of the Spinward Main enabled easy access to large parts of the sector but the remainder was largely ignored and there was little interest in pushing beyond, even to spinward or rimward where there were open borders. To coreward, the Zhodani Consulate blocked further expansion.

In 250, the Imperium had spread into those parts of the sector easily reachable via the Spinward Main, bypassing less accessible regions. Regina, settled as early as 75, became a major trade centre, acting as a hub for half a dozen neighboring worlds. By 250, this number had grown to 17, although some were very minor colonies.
Expansion slowed further as easily-reached worlds were taken. Colonies grew into independent world-states in their own right and the region developed a respectable economy. However, backwaters remained exactly that; few new colonies were founded in most parts of the sector.

### War

By 500, tensions with the Consulate were rising as Imperial expansion, although slow, had resulted in Imperial and Zhodani colonies being intermingled along the border. After a period of escalating tensions, war broke out in 589. The conflict took the form of skirmishing along the border and deep raids into the sector against the main Imperial worlds. The Imperial Navy was caught at less than full readiness and the Zhodani formed the first Outworld Coalition with Vargr states in the Gvurrdon sector.

Eventually, the Imperials were able to force a stalemate and the subsequent armistice, enacted in 604, ended what is now known as the First Frontier War. The Imperium lost territory but was compensated with ownership of large unclaimed areas of the sector.
Had the Zhodani wanted these systems, they had had centuries to take them unopposed, so this was an easy concession for them to make.

The Imperial commander in the Marches, Grand Admiral Olav hault-Plankwell, was deeply disgusted at the lack of support he had received during the war. Desperately needed reinforcements were not released from other sector fleets despite Plankwell’s entreaties. When they finally arrived, the reinforcements were enough to force a stalemate, after which Plankwell used them for another purpose.

With a fleet at his back, Plankwell advanced on Capital, assassinated Empress Jacqueline and took the Iridium Throne for himself. This began the Civil War, during which a series of emperors ruled for brief periods. These Emperors of the Flag or Barracks Emperors were almost all naval commanders who defeated the last claimant only to fall in battle themselves.

While the Civil War was raging, the Outworld Coalition reformed and struck again, in 615. The Second Frontier War, which lasted until 620, was characterised by a brilliant, if rather desperate, holding action orchestrated by Grand Admiral Arbellatra Alkhalikoi, coupled with raids by Imperial cruiser forces into enemy territory.
Benefiting from a crash-building program to replace losses incurred in the Frontier and Civil wars, Arbellatra fought the Outworld Coalition to a bloody standstill.
She unilaterally negotiated an armistice that ceded more Imperial territory to the Zhodani and, as Plankwell before her, advanced on Capital.

The Second Frontier War ended in 620 and, in 622, Grand Admiral Arbellatra reached Capital and defeated the fleet of Emperor Gustus. Rather than simply take the crown, she appointed herself regent, holding the throne in trust until the Imperial Moot could settle the matter of succession. Arbellatra was made Regent in 622 and crowned Emperor by the Moot in 629, ending the Civil War and beginning the modern dynasty.

These events stripped the Marches of its fleet but there was no resumption of hostilities with the Zhodani for many years. Indeed, it was not until 979 that conflict broke out once again. There had been incidents, and even a few skirmishes, in the intervening time and tensions had been rising for some years.

Despite this, the Imperial response was disjointed and, overall, inadequate. The war mainly took the form of commerce raiding by cruisers while the battle fleets of both sides faced off but did little. The Navy and Emperor himself were censured for their lack of activity and, eventually, in 986 a peace agreement was reached.
The terms were unfavourable to the Imperium and this, coupled with general disaffection over the way the war was prosecuted, resulted in the abdication of Emperor Styryx.

The settlement eliminated problematical border regions and allowed a good defensive frontier to be set-up in accordance with the ‘thin hard crust’ strategy then in

use. This strategic model called for a forward defensive zone to be held as strongly as possible but was replaced by a more flexible system of defence in depth.

Peace returned to the Marches, although elsewhere the Solomani Rim War distracted Imperial attention. Then, in 1082, the Fourth Frontier War erupted. This conflict was triggered by an unintentional incident and took the form of a series of naval battles along the frontier.
It was over quickly; peace was made in 1084, before the Emperor’s orders for conduct of the war or any significant reinforcements reached the Marches. Again, there was some slight realignment of borders.

Since the end of the False War, as it is sometimes known, the region has existed in relative peace. There

are troubles on various worlds, the occasional Imperial intervention or trade war between corporations and so forth, but there are no indications that major troubles are brewing.

### THE MARCHES TODAY

The Spinward Marches of today, in the year 1105 since the founding of the Third Imperium, are the product of great and small events, the distant and more recent past continuing to influence the present with many initiatives and movements afoot. Some are overt, some hidden and some a combination of both. The consequences of some of these actions cannot be predicted even by their instigators. Whatever else may be true, the Marches of 1105 are an interesting place.
![[BtC-5094.jpg]]

### STATES AND PEOPLES OF THE MARCHES

The majority of worlds and people in the Marches are part of the Imperium and are dealt with here.
Note however that the Imperium is not a monolithic organization; it has many power blocs and interest groups, some are aligned with external factions. Others are pursuing their own ends, which may not coincide with the best interests of the Imperium as a whole.

### The Aslan

There are no Aslan worlds in the Marches but there are Aslan populations on several. Some are integrated into the local population (such as in the Darrian Confederation) while others remain aloof in their own settlements. Some are present legally and with the blessings of the world government; some are squatters who have simply grabbed land, a common practice among Aslan _ihatei_ , or ‘second sons’. Aslan males value land ownership very highly but only the primary heir inherits. Some males are happy to serve their clan in a subordinate role. The _ihatei_ are the others; those who have set out to make their own fortune.

_Ihatei_ settlements sometimes trade in goods or services, with several worlds having units of Aslan mercenaries as part of their planetary armed forces. Others are simply armed camps whose inhabitants just want to be left alone and are prepared to repel any attempt to interfere with their plans.

Aslan society is very male-dominated, with females taking supporting roles as managers, technicians and scientists while the males are pilots, soldiers and leaders. This can make them difficult to deal with but, in many ways, Aslan are easier to get along with than Sword Worlders.

Aslan have a strict culture of duty and honor, and can be insulted very easily by those that do not understand their ways. Some Aslan are more understanding about the cultural ignorance of outsiders but the basics of Aslan etiquette (enough not to get into serious trouble)
can be quickly picked up, enabling interaction with Aslan without being challenged to a duel.

Aslan trade ships and mercenary units are common in the Marches, with _ihatei_ settlements restricted mainly to the spinward-rimward corner of the sector.
Individuals and small groups have settled on many worlds and are unlikely to attract comment from most Imperial governments.

### The Darrian Confederation

The Darrian Confederation is an ally of the Imperium and welcomes Imperial ships subject to customs checks and traffic controls. The Darrian alliance dates from 595 and was a response to a Sword Worlder invasion of the Entropic Worlds, then a territory of the Darrian Confederation.

The Darrians control a small area of space, containing 17 worlds. This has changed over time, largely due to Sword Worlder invasions, but otherwise the Confederation is very stable. However, some Imperial citizens view the Darrians with a certain amount of suspicion.

The reason for this is the Darrians’ possession of the Star Trigger, a doomsday weapon based on the probe that caused their own near-extinction in the Maghiz.
A version of the Star Trigger was reportedly deployed around 400 and is carried aboard vessels of the Special Arm, a Darrian force dedicated to protecting the Star Trigger and using it if the need arises.

The Special Arm has at least one secret base; it is not known how many ships they have, nor how many Star Triggers are operational. As far as is known, the weapon has not been tested in the field; a successful test would be noticed, so the assumption is that one has not been performed. The Darrians, however, maintain they have a working Star Trigger available if needed.

Being a small state, the Darrian Confederation maintains a modest but capable navy crewed by Darrian and Aslan personnel but a handful of TL16 vessels exist, relics left over from the pre- Maghiz period that cannot be replaced or even properly maintained, so they are used sparingly.

Darrian ships conduct exchange training programmes with Imperial vessels and joint operations are not unknown. For the most part, the Confederation patrols and polices its own space and the Imperium does likewise. Trade ships, on the other hand, come and go as they please. However, the need to go through the unwelcoming Sword Worlds or around through neutral space limits volume of trade somewhat.

The Darrians are not at war with the Sword Worlds but a state of mutual mistrust and dislike exists, seasoned with ongoing resentment over the Entropic Worlds and other issues, although neither side wants open war.

The Confederation is not expansionistic. There are many unclaimed worlds nearby but the Darrians have never showed much interest in acquiring new territories. Its people are more interested in scientific research and finding ways to improve their peaceful lives.

Darrian itself receives a fair numbers of tourists who go to see the high-tech wonders left behind by the Maghiz. However, the capital of the Confederation is at Mire, the first world to regain spaceflight and is today the centre of both government and the economy.

![[BtC-5107.jpg]]

### The Droyne

Droyne can be encountered all over the Marches, although not commonly. There are a few communities on various worlds, mostly in isolated areas, and several ships that move around according to whatever agenda they may have.

There are two Droyne-owned worlds in the Marches; Candory and Andor. Both lie close together in the Five Sisters, where only jump-3 ships can reach them, and both are interdicted by strong Imperial Navy squadrons for reasons that are classified. Most believe the interdiction is related to Droyne use of psionics, which is disapproved of by the Imperium. Authorities decline to comment when asked.

Droyne ships come and go from these two worlds and are sometimes sighted in ports across the Marches and beyond. There is also some civilian access, mainly to trade ships with special permits in place. However the Droyne themselves, like those living in small enclaves on various worlds in the Marches, do not seem to be very interested in outside contact.

It is possible to visit the same Droyne _oytrip_ (community) on several occasions and receive a different reception each time. The Droyne do not explain themselves to outsiders and are something of a mystery, even to the experts who study them. To the average Traveller, they are incomprehensible.

### The Federation of Arden

The Federation of Arden does not, technically, exist.
Arden is one of several independent worlds lying between the Imperial/Zhodani border that have been influenced by both powers over the centuries. In recent years, Arden has proposed a local defence association among nearby worlds with a view to creating a formal alliance neutral to both Zhodani and Imperial interests.

Although this idea has not been met with great enthusiasm, a number of political pressure groups, businesses and minor shipping lines have recently begun making a lot of noise about a Federation of Arden. Exactly what is meant by this term depends on who is using it. It is often used to describe a loose alliance of businesses and groups attached to the political coat-tails of Arden.

There are those who predict that some kind of trade or even military alliance may emerge in time. This would require other governments to sign up, which does not seem imminently likely. It is probable that the whole thing is just talk but the Federation of Arden has now passed into common use in the surrounding region. Time will tell what form the Federation eventually takes.

### The Sword Worlds

One of the big questions in the Marches is this: which is correct? The Sword Worlds _is_ , or the Sword Worlds _are_? The Sword Worlders themselves seem unable to decide, which implies the latter is true.

The Sword Worlds Confederation is a very loose alliance whose members spend much of their time arguing or jostling for position. Individual governments tend to pursue their own agendas, even when a cooperative effort being made. Joint ventures are usually short-lived, although a charismatic individual can sometimes hold things together where a paper agreement would simply fall apart.

As a result, unless there is a severe external threat or major opportunity, Sword Worlder activity tends to be disjointed. When the Confederation acts as a whole, it can do so with a surprising degree of unity in the short term. Naval and military assets, which normally belong to the individual worlds, are pooled under central command and, once a chain of command is established (which can be a difficult process), the combined fleet can be expected to follow orders whatever local agendas may be in place.

One reason for this is that, although the Sword Worlds Confederation resembles a dysfunctional family with feuds and jealousies, it is still a family. Almost any rivalry or dispute can be set aside while a threat to the Confederation is dealt with.

However, in peacetime, this means that vessels ostensibly belonging to the Sword Worlds Confederation Navy must be thought of as serving their own homeworld first and foremost. To an outsider, a patrol vessel out of Gram might look just like one out of Narsil but their captains have very different priorities.

Imperials find the Sword Worlders difficult to deal with (and vice versa) due to cultural differences. Sword Worlders are chauvinistic (some would instead say extremely protective) towards women and find it hard to accept Imperial females in positions of responsibility or power. They come over as haughty and arrogant, and look down on those who do not meet their standards.

The Sword Worlds Confederation is politically unfriendly to the Imperium and Darrian Confederation; this does not mean actively hostile or stupid. The Sword Worlders do not want a war with the Imperium, in which their vessels would be overmatched in both numbers and technology, and do not deliberately provoke the Imperials. They will not, however, allow themselves to be pushed around.

Passing through Sword Worlder space thus tends to be unpleasant and difficult rather than dangerous for most minor ship operators such as free traders, and expensive for the bigger lines. Those that have won the respect of the Sword Worlders, on the other hand, are treated as old friends and find a warm welcome among their Sword Worlder brothers-in-all-but-blood.

It is not possible to describe an over-arching Sword Worlds Confederation plan for the future, other than to say that the Sword Worlds want to be left alone to captain their own fate. Exactly what each world is planning at any given time varies greatly.

The Sword Worlds owns the four so-called Metal Worlds (Iron, Bronze, Mithril and Steel) but has not done much with them. They are designated as reserve worlds in much the same way the Imperium earmarks uninhabited worlds for future development when the means are available or need arises. As yet, there has been little activity and an expression of interest by the Imperial Colonial Office in developing one or more of the worlds has not been rebuffed by the Sword Worlders.

### The Vargr

Vargr are the second most common species in the Imperium, especially at the coreward end of Imperial space. Most worlds in the Marches have a mixed human/
Vargr population, although humans are prevalent.
On a few worlds, the minority Vargr are second-class citizens or live in separate communities but, for the most part, humans and Vargr live in the same streets and apartment blocks, work alongside and are entirely familiar with one another.

Imperial Vargr are just that; Imperial citizens like anyone else, and seen as a-person-from-Regina, for example, rather than an alien. They tend to display Imperial cultural influences or follow the culture of their homeworld, just like anyone else.

Non-Imperial Vargr, from the Extents, come from different cultures, one of many that exist in the region.
They have different habits and values to Imperial Vargr, depending on their origins. There are no large Vargr states in the Marches and no monolithic power structure in the Extents. Local politics are vigorous at times and governments can change on a short time frame, making cross-border politics somewhat interesting.

Vargr of all origins show their pack-animal roots in a tendency to gravitate to individuals or ideas with charisma. Charisma is hard to define in this context; each individual Vargr has his own idea of what constitutes a worthy cause or leader. Status and recognition tend to be more important to Vargr than in humans, especially if it comes from someone the Vargr admires or respects.

Contrary to stereotypes, Vargr are not flighty in their allegiances. They may transfer loyalty from one leader to another if he has sufficient charisma, however this is not done lightly. It is usually considered a natural consequence of meeting a more charismatic leader, rather than betrayal if a Vargr leaves his old allegiance.
However, this does not mean a Vargr naval officer will switch sides at the drop of a hat. Charisma is a factor but there are many others to be considered; demonstrating loyalty to a leader is a charismatic act in its own right.

Vargr trade boats from the Extents can be encountered all over the Marches, especially in the coreward-trailing corner of the sector. Unfortunately, so can corsairs.
Raiding is considered a more honorable profession by Vargr than humans and some states of the Extents actively encourage it, though most Imperial Vargr are less accepting of raiding and piracy.

### The Zhodani Consulate

The Zhodani Consulate is the largest non-Imperial power with an interest in the Marches. Its holdings are small, confined to a couple of subsectors along the spinward-
coreward edge of the sector, but the influence of the Consulate reaches much further into the sector than this.

Zhodani military ships are unlikely to be encountered in Imperial territory except as escorts for consulate officials or valuable cargoes. They are occasionally active in neutral areas and routinely transit a narrow corridor through Imperial space to the Sword Worlds for
‘diplomatic purposes’. Access is permitted by treaty for a small tonnage of vessels each year with the Imperial Navy shadowing the Zhodani vessels during transit.

Zhodani merchants and couriers are seen somewhat more often, and range more widely, but as a rule they tend to stay out of Imperial space. There is a persistent theory that the first three Frontier Wars (the fourth was an accident) were fought because the Zhodani felt threatened by the Imperium, and that if there is no perceived threat then there will be no more war or interaction. The Zhodani do not seem interested in what happens outside their own extensive borders.

There are those, of course, who take the opposite view. They contrast the lack of Zhodani ships in Imperial space with the way Imperial vessels routinely trade into the Vargr Extents and neutral space beyond, as well as into the Consulate itself, and suggest it is the ships they do not see that are the problem. There are also claims that the Consulate is sponsoring anti-Imperial sentiment within the Marches.

The Consulate is not inclined to comment on these matters. It maintains a strong naval and military presence along the border and is not receptive to Imperial vessels crossing into the Consulate. Permits are required and boardings are not uncommon. While vessels are not harassed, they are not welcomed either.

Exactly how negative an image this creates depends greatly on the outlook of the ship crew in question. Those who dislike the Zhodani speak of this lack of welcome as a deliberate attempt to discourage Imperials from entering the Consulate. Those with a more neutral viewpoint feel the Zhodani simply do not care one way or the other and that Imperial ships with the right paperwork are as welcome as any others.

It would be surprising if the Zhodani Consulate did not have intelligence gathering apparatus within Imperial space. The availability of psionic powers grants extra capabilities but most likely the Consulate uses a mundane system of agents, informants and couriers like other states. Its own counter-intelligence system seems to be very effective, when it works.

The rest of the time, Imperial agents in Zhodani space seem to be able to operate undiscovered. Asking why this might be leads to the conclusion that perhaps the Zhodani are content to leave most agents in place and only remove those who are troublesome.

The Zhodani Consulate has a maximum TL14 and enormous industrial power. The size of its fleets are unknown but, based on previous conflicts, they are likely to be huge. Certainly, large numbers of patrol craft have been sighted along the border and these seem to be very efficient.

### Minor Races

Members of minor races can be encountered across the Marches, serving aboard starships, working in ports or settling into jobs far from their homeworld. Although the vast majority of citizens are humans or Vargr, there is nothing unusual about seeing an alien (or group of aliens) going about their business.

Some minor races have their homes in the Marches and most do not have starship technology so tend to be encountered only rarely away from home. Minor races are full members of the Imperium if they are members at all, as there is no discrimination based on species.
However, the homeworlds of most minor races are relatively undeveloped, so their economic importance is small. Minor race homeworlds are represented in the Imperium by nobles like any other, unless interdicted for their own protection or the safety of others.

## THE IMPERIUM

The majority of worlds in the Spinward Marches are members of the Third Imperium and Imperial corporations, officials from various services such as the Bureaucracy and members of the armed forces are common. Navy patrols are also a common occurrence, especially in systems on a major trade route.

Beyond the Imperial border, corporations are still active, although less so, and the Navy makes sweeps into neutral space. The Scout Service is also very active outside the Imperium. Local corporations and businesses, whether based in the Imperium or just outside it, often operate across the border without much regard to whether a world is part of the Imperium or not. Local regulations vary considerably and matter more than the allegiance of the world.

In this respect the border is a ‘soft’ one, in that although worlds on the border conduct customs checks like any other, they have no obligation to treat trans-border shipping differently to that coming from within the Imperium. As always, local conditions vary and some worlds choose to impose taxes on cross-border goods that would not be permitted under free-trade laws within the Imperium. This is a local matter and of no interest to Imperial authorities, so long as internal trade is not affected.

### Nobility

There is no Archduke, as there is no domain structure for the Marches to be part of. If there were, it would be the Domain of Deneb and probably administered by one of the sector dukes from more developed regions closer to the Imperial core, who would accordingly be granted the title of Archduke.

The Marches have the usual system of Imperial nobility in place, with individual worlds represented by barons or marquises and larger groupings administered by an Imperial count answering to the subsector duke.
The position of Sector Duke, the most senior of the subsector dukes, which grants additional powers and responsibilities over the entire sector, is not officially assigned in the Marches.

However, the importance of Mora as a trade centre and the ‘Gateway to the Marches’ grants it, and the associated subsector, unmatched importance and so the role of Sector Duke is carried out semi-officially by Duchess Delphine of Mora. This practice has been in place for centuries by Delphine’s ancestors and is commonly accepted as the way things should be.
Only those politically opposed to Delphine herself even question her primacy. She makes a point of not using the title of Sector Duke, although many of her supporters unofficially apply it.

Although the Marches remains something of an undeveloped backwater, it is also a frontier region and one that has historically been troubled by threats major and minor. As a result, many nobles maintain larger household forces (huscarles) than is common practice elsewhere in the Imperium. These forces are still not, for the most part, enormous and mostly consist of a patrol vessel or two and/or a battalion-sized light infantry force.

Some nobles, notably Duke Norris of Regina, maintain considerable forces. Duke Norris has a distinguished background in the Imperial Navy and remains dedicated to protecting the frontier from whatever threats emerge.
Some would call him paranoid but his personal forces have more than once been the first-response formations in a crisis and have a good record. Among them is a unit also known as the 4518th Lift Infantry (Duke Norris’ Own Huscarles), raised by the duke as part of his personal forces but spends most of its time on loan to the Imperial Army.

Other nobles also loan part of their personal forces to the Imperial Army or ships to the Colonial Fleet, in the same way that many world governments do, although this practice is rare even in the Marches.

Among the other notable members of the nobility in the Marches is Leonard Fratelli Bolden-Tukera, Marquis of Aramis. Although ‘merely’ a marquis associated with a single world, his association with the powerful Tukera family gives him great power. The Tukera family are the founders of Tukera Lines, one of the Imperial megacorporations, and remain principal shareholders.

Although Tukera, like most megacorporations, has only a limited interest in the Marches, this translates to a large number of ships passing through the bigger ports and a very large amount of money changing hands. Thus far, Tukera’s interests are to not push far into the sector but there are rumors of investment in starports, which surely implies an expansion of the firm’s operations.

### Military

The Spinward Marches is defended by the Spinward Marches Sector Fleet of the Imperial Navy under the command of Sector Admiral Santanocheev, who is based at Mora. Unusually, there is no depot system in the Marches. Instead, the Sector Fleet’s major battle squadrons are usually deployed far forward at bases in the Regina, Vilis, Lanth and Lunion subsectors, with a strategic reserve in Trin and Mora.

Cruiser forces are similarly deployed for the most part, although a significant number are based further back to counter raids like those of the Third Frontier War.  Support vessels, such as tankers, are mainly deployed in the rearward bases along with a fair proportion of the sector fleet’s destroyer strength.

Light vessels such as escorts are largely deployed with the major battle squadrons, the remainder dispersed throughout the sector for patrol and security work. In this capacity, they back up the larger numbers of light vessels available to subsector commands.

Two semi-independent commands exist. One is the Darrian Squadron, a small force deployed to the Darrian Confederation as a gesture of solidarity. The other is rather larger and includes an entire BatRon
(Battleship squadRon), albeit of older capital ships and several cruisers, and is based in the Five Sisters. Its responsibility is to maintain the interdiction of the Droyne worlds at Andor and Candory, and launch the occasional sweep spinward or rimward of Imperial territory.

This somewhat dispersed deployment has been criticized but there are justifications, one being maintenance of a fierce face to deter aggression. There is also a perceived need to meet any incursion far forward to prevent a repeat of the Third Frontier War, in which the Navy was

censured for its perceived lack of activity. There are those who fear these deployments are motivated too much by politics rather than military reality but their protests, despite being repeatedly made at the court of Duchess Delphine, have not been heeded.

Every subsector that contains Imperial worlds has a subsector fleet assigned to it, numbered rather than named. For example, the Imperial 193rd Fleet is based at Frenzie and responsible for the defence and security of the Vilis subsector.

The strength of the subsector fleets varies considerably.
Most are built around a core consisting of a cruiser or carrier as flagship, a squadron or two of destroyers and a varying number of escorts and patrol ships. Technically, the subsector fleet also contains system squadrons of worlds that possess them, along with the security and defence squadrons assigned to naval bases. However, since these are not normally capable of leaving their home system, they usually devolve to local control.

The subsector fleets are assigned a mix of vessels supposedly adequate to meet patrol, security and defensive needs within their area of operations but, in practice, there are always too few vessels, and subsector admirals continually ask for reinforcements or assistance from Sector Command. Numbers are also made up by Colonial Fleet vessels, which include Scout Service ships and a few minor combatants on loan from nobles or world governments.

In time of war, some subsector commands could expect to receive cruisers or battleships transferred from Sector Command or deployed as reinforcements in important subsectors. ‘Fortress’ worlds with their own powerful forces provide for their own defence but the rest of the subsector would be vulnerable until the Sector Fleet could drive invaders out.

A significant marine force is maintained at naval bases for deployment at need. These forces are under Navy command and operate in conjunction with naval assets.
Imperial Army formations, on the other hand, have an independent command structure.

Like the Navy, the Imperial Army maintains local headquarters in each subsector with a sector headquarters at Mora. Major Army forces, including aerospace and orbital defence formations, are deployed to critical worlds along the frontier, while the remainder are based further back. Detachments are deployed throughout the sector on missions as varied as internal security, counterinsurgency and peacekeeping roles.

There is always conflict going on somewhere, or else a need for Army personnel to assist in disaster-relief operations. For the most part, however, these are minor operations and the Army as a whole is on a peacetime footing.

### Shipping and Communications

Information and goods both move in much the same manner, carried along major trade routes between larger ports then spreading out to worlds along ‘feeder’ routes, usually aboard smaller ships as distance from the major routes increases. This is adequate for routine cargo but priority items and important messages are often sent aboard small, fast courier ships that cannot make a profit from standard-rate bulk shipping but charge a higher fee for fast or secure service.

Most large organizations, corporations, Imperial services, and armed forces, tend to maintain their own courier network. As a rule, information moves along the x-boat routes at a theoretical maximum speed of jump-4 and, on average, somewhat slower. Dedicated high-jump couriers deliver critical information faster, although at an appropriately high price – jump-6 couriers are not cheap.

![[BtC-5138.jpg]]

Non-urgent and civilian communications across the Marches are carried in several ways. The express boat (x-boat) network carries routine messages in electronic format between x-boat stations, from where the information spreads like ripples on a pond. Scout Service vessels and commercial couriers carry mail dumps, duplicates of all electronic media to arrive in the past few weeks, to nearby worlds on a regular basis. This means that any given message arrives several times, ensuring that a problem with a ship or data packet simply means a delay rather than loss of data.

Worlds that receive few vessels can be weeks or even months behind the times. The story of a world that does not know the Fourth Frontier War has ended yet is apocryphal but backwater systems do not get updates very often.

Physical mail and freight can be even less common on some worlds. Many small merchant vessels supplement their income as ‘mail ships’, which simply means having a dedicated cargo area made available for small packages intended for destination worlds. If there are none, the mail space is used for other purposes. Many worlds are part of postal unions that have a dedicated mail ship (or several) plying between them, ensuring electronic mail arrives in a timely fashion and physical items reach their destination sooner or later.

Ships are sometimes chartered to take cargo to a specific destination, or a collection of incidentals will be placed in a standard container and shipped at normal freighting rates whenever a vessel is headed in the right direction. This occasionally results in a vessel delivering a 1-ton shipping container that holds only a few small items. It is of no concern to the vessel operator whether the container is full or not; the fee for carrying it is the same.

The other way that goods move around is through speculative trading on the part of shipowners. Rather than take a cargo in return for a flat fee, a ship operator may decide to buy goods at one port and sell them at another, hoping for a profit. Shipping empty hold space is expensive, so even goods that do not cover these costs are better than carrying nothing.

Exploratory trade is a special case of speculative trade.
In this case, a speculative cargo is taken into an area in order to investigate its trade potential. New markets opened in this way can be very lucrative but risks are high; there is no guarantee of selling the cargo at all.
Exploratory trade is the province of specialist trade scouts and the occasional free trader captain gripped by entrepreneurial spirit.

### Megacorporations

Megacorporations are active in the Spinward Marches; indeed, it was LSP that first set up a trade base at Mora and paved the way for expansion into the sector.
Corporate freighters belonging to Delgado and Tukera run into Mora and then up the Spinward Main, although on the whole smaller ships are used for runs deeper into the Marches.

Exceptions include the major lines through to Lunion, Trin and Glisten, and coreward towards Rhylanor and Regina. These runs are plied by big megacorporate freighters and liners as well as smaller ships.

The financial corporations are active wherever there is a need for investment and those with mining interests
(notably LSP and Sternmetal Horizons) have facilities on several mainworlds, outsystem planets and planetoid belts. Similarly, trade and commerce exist everywhere, although many areas of the Marches are not worth megacorporate interest; they simply do not offer enough return.

Instellarms has major facilities in the Marches, offering weaponry to governmental, corporate and mercenary clients. Its regional headquarters is at Mora but many major worlds have an office or other facilities.

As a rule, the megacorporations can be encountered wherever it is worth their while to operate. Low-tech and low-population worlds are not good prospects and nor are hard-to-reach places. Thus, the big firms are mainly restricted to major worlds with good communications links to the rest of the Imperium. This creates a niche for smaller corporations and minor firms, including freelance outfits, to make a profit in the gaps between the major players’ fields of interest.

## PSIONICS INSTITUTES

Officially, all research into psionics and the teaching and use of psionic talents were prohibited three centuries ago. All overt schools of psionics were closed down, psi-drug corporations forced to end production and psionics use in the Imperium more or less came to an end.

It is an open secret that the Imperium continues to conduct research in order to counter the use of psionic powers by foreign agents (such as the Zhodani) or illegal users. It is also widely believed that psionic skills are still taught in underground psionics institutes.

Exactly what constitutes an institute varies from one case to the next. Some are academic in nature, operating quietly on the fringes of society or under the guise of more legitimate activities. Others are secret societies, crazy old hermits or other oddball characters who teach their skills to an apprentice. All of these ‘institutes’ have one thing in common – they are illegal and unregulated. There is no guarantee that what appears to be a source of psionic training is not a scam, con, cover for something else, or a genuinely crazy person. It might even be something quite sinister like a cult.

Even where psionics training is genuinely available, it may be flawed or incomplete. Three centuries of underground teaching has resulted in some serious misconceptions and there is no recourse if an individual’s quest for training ends badly.

This does not stop individuals seeking such training. Most find nothing or come to the attention of the authorities and are discouraged from continuing. Others land themselves in trouble by poking around in underworlds where they assume an institute can be found, or waste large amounts of time and money visiting obscure places, which are potentially dangerous. It is entirely possible to starve to death or be killed by wildlife searching the outback of a frontier world for an institute that ceased to exist centuries ago.

There are, however, sources of psionic training for those able to find them. Each is very different and the chances of finding one that teaches all disciplines is remote, to say the least. For the psionicist seeking to develop their full potential, the quest for knowledge and teachers is liable to be a lifetime challenge.

## IMPERIAL RESEARCH STATIONS

The Imperium maintains a number of research installations in the Marches. Most are mundane laboratories in cities of high-population, high-tech worlds, where the staff go home to very ordinary lives at the end of the day. Others are corporate laboratories on contract to the Imperium or military facilities located at army or naval bases.

Most do important but unexciting work, such as developing improved targeting software for naval applications or pushing the envelope of gravitic technology to wring an extra tenth of a percent efficiency out of gravitic systems. However, there are a number of less ordinary installations that conduct highly secret research.

These installations are located in remote areas of inhabited planets or outsystem worlds, and designated by a Greek letter (such Research Station Gamma

located on Vanejen in the Rhylanor subsector). Access is restricted; the surrounding area is normally considered a Red Zone and anyone visiting without a permit is liable to be arrested and punished for the violation. Lethal force is and can be used against anyone declining to surrender.

The nature of research undertaken at these facilitates is highly classified. Most specialise in one area, but this is not always the case, and wild theories exist about what any given installation does. Most concern exciting subjects like psionics research, biochemical warfare and investigation of Ancients devices. All that is known for certain is that these installations are highly secure and that a lot of money is spent on them. Budgetary allocations are not available for scrutiny other than by a very select group of personnel within the Bureaucracy.

## OTHER IMPERIAL INSTALLATIONS

Other than military bases, scout service way stations, and research institutes, the Imperium has a number of installations within the Marches. Most are located at highports and major cities, such as embassies, administrative centres and recruiting offices for various forces and services. The Ministry of Justice also maintains a number of facilities ranging from training centres to prisons.

The latter tend not to be large. Worlds handle their own law enforcement and punishment of offenders, and the Imperium only deals with Imperial felons. Most of the latter are guilty of extremely serious crimes, which may carry the death penalty. These hardcore prisoners are detained in extremely high-security installations on asteroids, in remote areas or aboard prison hulks created by gutting a surplus starship of its drives and weapons. Less dangerous perpetrators of significant crimes, such as large-scale embezzlement, are also detained in these installations.

Despite a number of accusations and entertainment shows on the subject, the Imperium does not have hundreds of prison hulks filled with political prisoners scattered throughout the Marches. There are relatively few Imperial felonies meriting incarceration in an installation of this kind. The sort of people sent to them are those considered far too dangerous to be dealt with in any other way, or else those with a penchant for escaping custody or evading punishment and who therefore require special treatment. The cost of supporting these installations is considerable, so they are only used when necessary.

![[BtC-CronorSubsector.jpg]]
There are 24 star systems in the Cronor Subsector, of which only one, Quar, is a member of the Imperium. Quar is the site of both an Imperial Navy and Scout Service base even though it is situated within Zhodani territory, a curious situation that came about as a result of treaty negotiations at the end of the Frontier Wars.
Although there is no subsector fleet, the base at Quar is heavily defended. In peacetime, it is home to a small flotilla of patrol ships that operate in neutral space and some intelligence-gathering vessels. In wartime, the base would probably be used as a forward staging post if it were not quickly eliminated.

The rest of the subsector is either controlled by the Zhodani Consulate or neutral. The neutral worlds are variously influenced by Imperial and Zhodani policies and sometimes a battleground for overt political manoeuvring or covert action by agents of both sides.
Trade ships from the Imperium and Consulate are also active among these worlds.

Astrographically, there are two main clusters of worlds in the subsector. The five worlds centered on Cipango are easier to reach from Imperial space than from Consulate holdings in the subsector, as this requires a jump-3 vessel or a roundabout trip through Whenge. This is not a problem for military ships but does make commercial shipping to this cluster and Zhodani holdings in Jewell more difficult.

The largest grouping of worlds centres on Cronor (sometimes spelt Chronor by Imperial cartographers), which is the Consulate capital of the subsector and a major naval base. Cronor has the highest Tech Level and population in the subsector, and is a major economic centre. Unsurprisingly, it is also very heavily protected.

There are also important Consulate bases at Errere, Gesentown and Cipango, and major fleet assets are based at these locations. The bases at Atsa, Ninjar and Sheyou are much smaller and play host to patrol vessels and couriers that make the run to rimward into the Querion subsector.

The Zhodani border has been stable in this region for centuries, other than some slight readjustments resulting from conflict. Culturally, worlds that are members of the Consulate have been so for a long time and are entirely comfortable as members. There are also large numbers of people of Zhodani extraction who live on the neutral worlds. These are not part of the Consulate and, in most cases, have never been but are still, for the most part, culturally Zhodani. Imperial visitors often cannot tell the difference between non-Consulate Zhodani and their cousins on the other side of the border.

Other groups, living on the same worlds, are not Zhodani in terms of genetics or culture and this sometimes causes conflict. In other cases the two groups live happily together or remain separate without major difficulties. Each world is different.

To spinward-rimward, stellar density drops off quickly.  The Querion subsector to rimward is sparse and as a result there is little traffic across this gulf other than official couriers and military vessels.
![[BtC-5211.jpg]]

## CRONOR

The Cronor system is the regional capital for the Zhodani Consulate in the Spinward Marches. As such, it is heavily protected by both in-system (non-jump capable)
and conventional naval assets, as well as ground forces.
A large detachment of what Imperials refer to as the Consular Guard protects governmental installations and stands ready to fight large-scale battles.

Express courier routes known as postal routes come from deeper in the Consulate (via Errere) and are then staged onward into the Querion subsector via Atsa, and Jewell via Cipango. A minor spur runs coreward to the naval base at Gesentown.

The Consulate does not have a separate Scout Service like the Imperium, so operation of the postal routes and similar communications duties are undertaken by naval vessels. These are lightly armed but fast couriers operating out of a dedicated section of the Cronor naval base.

The Zhodani navy also undertakes a range of scientific and exploration missions, and vessels of this type also operate out of Cronor. Some function as intelligence-
gathering assets along the frontier but most are genuine scientific vessels. Although lightly armed and part of the navy, these are not combat assets and are no match for a warship of comparable size.

Cronor Naval Base is located on one of Cronor’s moons and is very extensive. Not only does it have formidable fortifications for its own defence, there are numerous long-range missile batteries on the surface for the defence of the planet proper. Civilian access to the base and associated moon is entirely prohibited.

Most visitors to Cronor are impressed, even staggered, by the size and quality of the highport. Located in orbit above Cronor, the highport receives all traffic from outside the Consulate and most from within. Access to the planetary surface is by a shuttle service operated from the port. Zhodani-registered vessels can obtain permission to proceed directly to the downport if necessary, however foreign ships cannot.

The highport is a city in space, with residential areas, parks, industrial zones and a full range of facilities for those who live and work there, as well as visitors. Clean, efficient and friendly, Cronor Highport is a showcase for the Consulate and creates a good first impression. In fact, the highport is all most visitors see of the world.
Travel to the surface is subtly discouraged and largely unnecessary, given that everything a Traveller could want is found in orbit.

Cronor itself is an average-sized world with a very thin atmosphere and plenty of water. Unassisted humans cannot function on the surface, although all that is needed is an air supply or compressor mask. Most of the populace do not venture outside the huge, sealed cities where they dwell. These are connected by maglev rail links and fast speeders.

The cities are self-contained arcologies, with millions or tens of millions living in each. There are some smaller settlements but most have specialist functions. Places where the bulk of the population live and work tend to be large for efficiency and social reasons.

The cities are all slightly different but each is a thoroughly pleasant place to be. As at the highport, there are parks and recreation facilities for public use and the streets are both clean and almost entirely free of crime. Law Level is moderately low by Imperial standards and to an outsider there seems to be little in the way of enforcement; rather than policing an unruly population, the Zhodani prefer to solve the problems that lead to crime and unhappiness, making ‘fire brigade’ style enforcement less necessary.

The people themselves are, for the most part, not merely contented but enthusiastic about what they do for a living or recreation. Rampant materialism is uncommon; there is an underlying philosophy of ‘don’t show me what you have, tell me what you’ve done’ among the proles and intendants of the Consulate. Personal achievements count for more than things bought with money.

With a population numbering in the billions, Cronor has a huge and powerful economy that produces high-technology goods for export as well as domestic use. Some even find their way into Imperial markets, although this is not common. Government takes the normal Zhodani form of officials elected from among, and by, nobles; not really democratic as the franchised class is so small, but nor is it quite the same thing as direct oligarchical rule.

Outside the cities much of Cronor’s surface is uninhabited. The population is more concentrated than  
on many Imperial worlds and this leaves considerable wilderness between settlements. There is a fair amount of plant life in the wilderness but few higher creatures due to the thin air.

## PLAVEN

Plaven is a large world with a thin, tainted atmosphere and a reasonable amount of surface water. It is capable of supporting life and was settled by colonists as the Imperium moved into the Marches. These arrived in an ad-hoc and disorganised manner, often without proper long-term planning or necessary equipment. Although semi-random colonization is discouraged by the Colonial Office, it is not possible to prevent it along the frontiers.

In the case of Plaven, there was no organised settlement program. The world was far out on the frontier and by the time it was surveyed, interest in expansion was waning. Rather than a central and well-organised colonial effort alongside random groups of landgrabbers, there was only the latter. If any given settlement hit hard times, there was no-one to turn to for help and no ICO-sponsored colonial hub to join if the independent effort failed.

Some colonists did well, others failed and died out, left or else joined other bands and shared their fortunes. The various tiny colonies never reached the critical mass necessary to become stable and grow, nor to pull in offworld trade.

As a result, Plaven’s small population struggled at subsistence level. High-tech gear wore out and although the colonists adapted to the world’s tainted atmosphere, their numbers dwindled steadily. Plaven was passed over by the four Frontier Wars, its nominal allegiance changing hands in treaty negotiations without any effect on the population. Plaven is now officially independent and part of the demilitarised zone between the Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate. If the locals even know about this, chances are they do not care.

Today, Plaven’s population is officially listed by the IISS as several hundred people subsisting without formal government, in a number of tiny hamlets and homesteads capable of supporting a steam-powered economy. There is no law as such, although the locals enforce their own basic code of conduct and have a working society based on the authority of senior family members.

The largest settlement contains about 80 people and is located close to a flat area of exposed rock that makes for a good, stable landing place for the occasional starship, with water from a nearby stream available to be cracked for hydrogen to make fuel. However, there are few reasons for anyone to visit Plaven – it is not even on the way to anywhere – so what might be termed a starport receives very few ships.

The official IISS figures for the population of Plaven may not be exact. Once every few years a Scout Service ship lands at the port and its personnel carry out a population census. Figures for the area around the port are probably accurate; Plaven is one of the few worlds where the IISS census actually lists every resident of the planet by name. However, it is possible that other enclaves exist elsewhere on the planet, perhaps survivors from another colonial settlement that went their own way.

If other groups exist, they have thus far avoided official notice and inclusion in the census figures. This could be done easily enough, deliberately, but equally could happen through a combination of low technology, remote location and less than zealous surveying by bored IISS crews sent to the far end of the Imperium to count heads on some distant rockball.

It is possible that other groups might have higher or lower Tech Levels than the official population, although higher tech would have to be deliberately concealed as emissions would be noticeable to even the most cursory survey. It is known that several remnant sites do exist, where early colonies were created then closed down or failed. Occasionally a free trader lands at one of these ruins, having mistaken it for a living settlement, and returns to Imperial space with wild tales of a ghost planet or worldwide catastrophe.

Most of these settlements were stripped long ago for whatever could be salvaged but some are very remote, beyond the reach of any of the remaining colonies.
It is possible that some of these remain intact. The occasional salvage mission is launched by freelancers, usually without much result. There have been big scores made from time-to-time, however.

Plaven briefly came to the attention of the Imperial authorities in 1093, when it was discovered that a group of criminals specialising in starship-borne raids on isolated communities along the frontier were using the world as a base. Although the loot obtained by raiding minor targets is minimal, the risks are also very small, so what are sometimes referred to as ‘space-going poultry thieves’ sometimes engage in such activity between more lucrative operations. Be that as it may, the band using a valley high in the Varnis Mountains as a base evaded capture for a long time before finally being eliminated in an action by Imperial Navy and marine assets.

After that, Plaven more or less fell off the radar once again, although Imperial patrols from Quar and vessels from the Zhodani Consular Navy occasionally sweep the system. This is infrequent enough that patrols rarely encounter one another. When they do, polite but guarded communications exchanges are normally made before the vessels go about their own business. arassment and similar ‘cold war’ tactics are avoided to reduce the chance of another accidental war.

## RASATT

Rasatt is a dry world with a dense atmosphere lying right on the border of the Zhodani Consulate. It has never been incorporated, probably for lack of value. Almost the entire population of around 90,000 live in a single city that bears the same name as the host world. The rest of the planet is wilderness. Rasatt (the city, although this applies to the world as a whole) is a dangerous mid-tech free-for-all, with gangs and local leaders controlling a few streets each of the run-down city. There is no law enforcement, although each group imposes its own rules on the areas it controls. Conduct tolerated can vary from street-to-street.

Rasatt is a haven for outcasts and criminals, and an area of interest for several intelligence agencies. In addition to hunting down the worst of the fugitives, intelligence teams assigned to Rasatt attempt to gather information on what is happening over the border. It has been claimed that virtually every tramp merchant ship that uses Rasatt’s so-called starport is in the pay of at least one intelligence agency, and that more than half the street gangs are composed of covert operatives. This is surely an exaggeration but it is an open secret that a quiet intelligence war is going on in the alleys and slums of Rasatt.

## ARAMIS - SPINWARDS MARCHES-SUBSCTOR D

The Aramis subsector lies at the coreward edge of the Marches. To trailing is the Pretoria subsector in Deneb, Imperial territory, but coreward is the Vargr Extents. Most Vargr incursions in the four Frontier Wars, and most corsair raids today, come through this subsector. As a result, the 214th Fleet, tasked with protection of Aramis, attempts to control access to the rest of the sector.

This activity is mainly concentrated on the rimward end of the subsector. The fleet is based out of Paya, Natoko and L’Oeul d’Dieu, clearly demonstrating the Navy’s lack of interest in the relatively unimportant worlds further coreward. Navy ships do sweep the more coreward systems but not anything like as frequently as the rimward ones.

Critics of the Imperial system of government like to point out that the Marquis of Aramis is a member of the Tukera family and Tukera is one of the main Imperial megacorporations. They suggest that it is not coincidence that Aramis itself has a naval base and is flanked by two others. Imperial Navy officials (and the office of the Marquis of Aramis) dismiss this as a typical example of paranoid anti-establishment ranting.

Junidy is the homeworld of a minor race called the Llellewyoly, colloquially known as ‘Dandelions’ as a result of their appearance. They are an oddball species falling somewhere between plants and animals, with a highly complex social order that routinely baffles outsiders.

> [!info]- Creating Ebokin Travellers
>
> ![[BtC-5492.jpg]]
> The Ebokin are a very alien race to human eyes, resembling a centipede-like creature with eight legs on a long rear section of the torso, plus four short arms on a frontal section of the torso, which is typically carried upright. In addition to acting as manipulators, these arms are used for communication. Ebokin cannot perceive sound other than as vibrations, as they possess no hearing organs. Their language requires four arms, although a pidgin version exists for use by humans and similarly inadequately enabled creatures.
>
> Ebokin are adapted to the environment of Yebab and breathe methane rather than oxygen. As a result of their homeworld conditions, their vision range lies in the ultraviolet, making interactions with humans difficult unless technical assistance is available. The Ebokin have a mature TL7 culture and are aware that much greater things could be achieved. As a species, they are keen to advance their scientific knowledge.
>
> Ebokin society is matriarchal and extremely conservative. Social change is slow, with strict laws that limit capacity for adaptation. This suits the typical Ebokin, who views human society as a chaotic maelstrom of changing views, lies and shifting moral ground.
>
> Ebokin rarely venture far from their homes but a small merchant/explorer caste has emerged in recentdecades, bravely seeking to learn about the wider universe through trade and purchase of scientific knowledge. A few travel aboard vessels crewed by other sophonts but some starships are entirely operated by Ebokin, most converted from standard human or occasionally Vargr designs.
>
> Physically, Ebokin are much more heavily built than humans, with a typical individual massing around 130kg. This makes them tougher than the typical human but less agile.
>
> ### Characteristics
>
> Ebokin Travellers have the following modifiers applied to their characteristics: DEX-2, END+3.
>
> ### Traits
>
> Ebokin Travellers all possess the following traits:
>
> Armor (+3): Ebokin are very heavily built and can shrug off minor blows with ease. They have natural armor Protection +3.
> Atmosphere (methane): Ebokin can function normally in an exotic (methane) atmosphere but require respiratory support in an oxygen-nitrogen environment.
> UV Vision: Ebokin view the world in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum and can see clearly in darkness.
>
> ### Careers
>
> The following careers from the Traveller Core Rulebook are all suitable for Ebokin: Agent (law enforcement), Army, Citizen, Drifter, Merchant, Noble, Scholar, Scout.

Yebab is home to the Ebokin, who have a matriarchal society with very strict laws and rarely leave their homeworld. They are bilaterally symmetrical, with four pairs of legs and two pairs of arms, and average less than a metre tall although they are about twice as long.
The Ebokin are of very little importance in Imperial affairs but Yebab is represented in the same manner as other Imperial worlds.

Ten worlds in the subsector are Amber Zoned; Zila, Rugbird, Towers, Corfu, Junidy, Zykoca, Aramanx, Pysadi, Dhian and Reacher, and the only Red Zone is Lewis. As usual, the reasons for the Red Zones are not publicly available.

Pysadi has been dominated for many years by a religious dictatorship that worships the planet itself and imposes a number of very strict laws regarding religious matters.
Offworlders have been known to unwittingly fall foul of these laws.

Notably, Pysadian law prohibits alcohol. This raises issues since the world is well known for its fruit crops and, while exported fruit makes good wine, that grown on-planet and fermented there produces some of the finest wines in Charted Space. The government has been cracking down on illegal winemaking operations in remote areas and, while this is strictly an internal matter, the lure of big money for Pysadian Atrake wine (made on-planet from Trake fruits) has brought many offworld entrepreneurs to Pysadi in search of their fortune. Recent newscasts about the Pysadian Booze Wars are massively exaggerated but nonetheless offworlders must be careful not to become involved.

### ARAMIS

Aramis is part of a secondary main lying just off the coreward-trailing tip of the Spinward Main. A spur leads rimward into the Rhylanor subsector but the primary arm runs to trailing across the rimward end of Pretoria. This gives jump-2 access to Pretoria itself and the very edge of the Lamas subsector beyond, although astrography intervenes at that point.

As a result, Aramis and the region around it is something of a nexus for trade into Deneb as well as the Vargr Extents to coreward. Considerable quantities of goods come into Aramis Highport from Pretoria via jump-1 vessels plying the main and then transhipped aboard jump-2 vessels via Nutema and Celepina, either to the Spinward Main or Rhylanor cluster.

There is a very healthy brokerage and private shipping industry operating out of Aramis Highport, in addition to vessels of the mid-level shipping line Akurat, a subsidiary of Tukera Lines dedicated to serving this region. Actual Tukera vessels do come this far coreward, if infrequently. Akurat ships call at the smaller ports of the coreward end of the subsector although their main business is done in the more settled areas towards the rimward ends of Aramis and Pretoria.

Few vessels proceed to the surface of Aramis. The world itself is forbidding, with a exotic atmosphere and no surface water. Despite this unpromising aspect, several hundred thousand people live in Aramis, underground in comfortable, high-tech and carefully sealed cities.

Aramis is the fief of an important member of the Tukera family, although it is not directly ruled - officially. The Marquis of Aramis is the richest and most powerful member of the ruling class on Aramis, all of whom are heads of critical industries or important businesses.
Thus, although the rank of Marquis is an Imperial title and does not confer rulership of the world, the Tukera family and the Marquis in particular dominate all government affairs.

Aramis also hosts both a naval and scout base. The naval base is co-located with the Highport and acts as the headquarters for the subsector fleet and system squadron, which is not large and augmented by a handful of system defence boats crewed by mercenaries. These are in service with the Aramis Port Authority but paid for by donations coming from the office of the Marquis. Heavy units of the Sector Fleet are based elsewhere in the subsector but there is usually a cruiser or carrier task group in the Aramis system on guardship deployment.

Guardships are usually deployed for several weeks at a time and normally relieved on station by a replacement vessel or task force. It is not possible to maintain many such standing deployments, especially of larger vessels like heavy cruisers, without diluting naval strength in the region excessively. Most naval deployments are part of a patrol schedule whereby vessels proceed through a series of locations in the course of a cruise, staying a few days at each before moving to the next.

The fact that Aramis enjoys the more-or-less permanent assignment of a heavy cruiser or similar-sized vessel, along with escorts and support vessels, suggests the navy considers it to be of great importance. However, there are plenty of other ports which see more trade and a lot of worlds whose industrial base is greater, so what is so special about Aramis?

The answer, at least as far as most cynics are concerned, is that Aramis is the fief of a senior member of a megacorporate family and given naval protection as a result of his firm’s importance to the Imperium.

Whether or not this is true, the location of Aramis at the coreward end of the subsector protects it from most raids launched by corsairs out of the Vargr Extents.
Akurat vessels are well defended and more than a match for a typical merchant-ship-turned-corsair. However, their very toughness makes them a target for a certain kind of raider captain, who seeks to make a reputation back home as much as profit from his voyages. Although requiring heavy firepower, good planning and luck, such strikes have been successful. As a rule, however, pirates tend to go after easier targets.

The Aramis scout base is not large, being mainly concerned with supporting the x-boat route from Rhylanor to Pretoria. Survey and exploration vessels operate out of this base, mainly to monitor and collect data on the rimward parts of the subsector; affairs to coreward are the province of the much larger way station at Junidy and the smaller base at Nasemin.

### JUNIDY

Junidy lies right on the coreward edge of the Imperium.
It is part of a cluster of worlds accessible with some difficulty by jump-2 ships coming coreward, or trailing via the Pretoria subsector of Deneb. Access from spinward, that is from the Regina subsector, is restricted by three or more parsecs of rift across all routes.

As a result, Junidy and its surrounding worlds are cut off from mainstream Imperial culture and receive many visitors from the Vargr Extents. Most are traders or Travellers, although corsairs do sometimes try to pass through the region. The most blatant are either forced to sneak through the frontier zone using wilderness refuelling (obtaining fuel from gas giants or by cracking water for hydrogen) or operate on the frontier, making a strike before disappearing over the border.

However, many corsairs masquerade as legitimate trade ships and these are often able to bluff their way through patrols and routine inspections along the way, getting into a trade route and preying on targets there.

Some organised corsair bands use a combination of these methods, slipping actual pirate ships in covertly. These heavily armed vessels are not far from being true warships and could never pass as merchants under an inspection.  Once within the Imperium, the raiders rendezvous with support vessels pretending to be legitimate merchants.  After a raid, the warships move to the next target area, conceal themselves and wait for a new opportunity while loot is sent back aboard the trade ships.

A particularly clever version of this trick has been used on at least two occasions by the Kforuzeng, thought to be the most powerful Vargr corsair band in Gvurrdon.
The Kforuzeng have been known to stash ships on remote asteroids until the heat from the last set of raids has died down, then slip a crew through aboard a merchant vessel. This crew boards the stashed vessel, makes a series of raids and then proceeds homeward after hiding their ship again.

Junidy, and similar worlds, are on the front line of this activity and system defence commanders routinely complain that they receive very little help from the Imperial Navy and yet come in for criticism every time a Vargr corsair vessel that they ‘allowed’ through makes a successful attack. Patrols from the Imperial Navy base at Riacon in Pretoria occasionally cross into the Marches to help, creating a command-jurisdiction issue routinely ignored in the name of getting the job done.

Scout vessels from the way station also augment local patrols, usually by re-tasking survey ships with excellent sensor arrays to watch for intruders sneaking through the system. This is a stop-gap solution implemented decades ago and has been left in place for lack of anything better, on the grounds that it works fairly well.

The way station is a large installation mostly concerned with maintaining the communications link into Pretoria and servicing Scout Service vessels. There is also an extensive training facility, which deals for the most part with Contact & Liaison work and specialises in the study of Vargr subcultures. The base is often used as a jumping-off point for long-range missions into the Vargr Extents and the relatively unexplored space beyond. A range of support vessels and scout cruisers are based there, although some have been known to depart on missions of several years’ duration and are rarely seen in port.

Junidy itself is a small world with a very thin atmosphere, home to a population numbering around 30 billion of whom about half belong to the minor race nicknamed ‘Dandelions’ or ‘Dandies’. Their correct name is Llellewyoly, as near as humans can pronounce it. The Dandies are adapted to the extremes of temperature experienced by Junidy in the course of its day and display traits of both plant and animal.

Llellewyoly have five multi-jointed limbs, which house their sense organs and serve interchangeably as hands and feet. The central, spherical, body is covered with long, coarse hair. These rather odd beings have a TL3 culture which is extremely complex. Individuals hold a number of social ranks, each with its own form of address, depending on the current situation. Using the wrong form of address for an individual’s current social status (which can literally change from one minute to the next) is a major social gaffe and can result in ostracism.

The human population has a TL9 civilization that is, for the most part, separate from that of the native Dandies. Conflict between the two groups has flared up on several occasions and even quiet periods are not without tensions and the occasional incident.

> The Llellewyloly are native to Junidy, although can sometimes be encountered on similar worlds with low surface gravity and very thin atmosphere. They are unusual among sentient species in that they have five limbs, all of which can function as legs, arms or something in between, whilst a central ‘head’ contains the major organs. Respiration is carried out across the entire surface of the central structure, enabling survival in a very thin atmosphere.
>
> Llellewyloly society is very complex and outsiders typically find the shift in focus from one individual to another bewildering. Even the humans of Junidy, who have shared their homeworld with the Llellewyloly for centuries, struggle to keep track of who is pre-eminent at any given moment.
>
> Physically, Llellewyloly are much more lightly built than humans, massing around 35kg. Their limbs are highly dextrous but fragile, with relatively poor lifting power, and they have difficulty in manipulating devices built for human hands.

> Alien Digits: Unless a device is specifically adapted for Llellewyloly, they suffer DM-2 for any checks related to its use.
> Atmosphere (thin): Llellewyloly can function without protection in a very thin atmosphere but require protection from a dense or very oxygen-rich atmosphere.

## QUERION - SPINWARDS MARCHES-SUBSECTOR E

![[BtC-QuerionSubsector.jpg]]
Querion lies entirely outside of the Imperium. Most of the subsector is claimed by the Zhodani Consulate as an area of interest, although if expansion into the area was desired it would have been carried out long ago. Much of this territory was gained at the end of the Third Frontier War.

Six worlds in the subsector are formally part of the Consulate and linked to it via a narrow strip of territory running coreward through the Cronor subsector. The Zhodani naval bases at Rapp’s World and Querion represent the most rimward Zhodani possessions in the Marches.

The remainder of the subsector is mostly neutral, although the Entropic Worlds (Winston, Entrope and Anselhome) are claimed by both the Sword Worlds and Darrian Confederations. They are, at present, held by the Sword Worlds, having been conquered in the Fourth Frontier War.

The Imperium set up Research Station Delta at Retinae when that world was part of the Imperium and has since maintained it as an Imperial possession on an otherwise neutral planet. It is connected to the Imperium by way of a naval courier route through Thanber and administered from Frenzie in the Vilis subsector.

QUERION SUBSECTOR

### Spinward Marches

### E

Although retention of the station was agreed to by the Consulate, alleged violations of the agreement are a frequent cause of Zhodani diplomatic protests.

The subsector is sparse in terms of stellar density and contains mostly mid-tech worlds of little economic or political importance. One exception is Bael, rumored to be the site of large deposits of lanthanum, which is vital to the manufacture of jump drives. This has attracted commercial interest and a certain amount of competition among freelance prospectors. The world’s remote location, requiring jump-3 ships for access, is a barrier to exploitation.

Critics of the Zhodani and their political system point to the fact that, although the Consulate is supposedly stable and works to prevent internal conflict, the population of Asmodeus still managed to break into factions and fight a nuclear war, which smashed the planetary economy and infrastructure, as well as drastically reducing the population. The Consulate has begun reconstruction as the radioactive dust settles but the conflict ended a century ago and there is little left to rebuild.

ENTROPE Entrope gives its name to the Entropic Worlds, a group of three star systems that have changed owners several times in the past few centuries. Although officially claimed by the Darrian Confederation, Entrope is under occupation by the Sword Worlds Confederation, having been conquered in the Fourth Frontier War.

The political situation is complicated as the Imperium backs the Darrian claim to the Entropic Worlds, while the Zhodani Consulate supports that of the Sword Worlders. This is more to do with politics and alliances than any belief in the rightness of the claims, and neither side is willing to precipitate an incident by expressing support in more than polite diplomatic terms.

A small world with a very thin atmosphere, Entrope was settled in the distant past and has received additional colonists at various times in its history. Despite the need for compressor masks when working outside and sealed environments for living in, the population grew steadily to the present level, numbering tens of billions.

This huge population is jammed into several enormous city-states with smaller communities between them.
Many of the latter are domed agricultural settlements, although seabed farming is also extensively used.

The cities are heavily and harshly policed to deal with the inevitable pressures caused by having so many

people in close proximity and to keep a lid on the world’s internal troubles. Society is heavily factionalised, with alliances between power groups forever changing and violence more or less the norm. Usually this is ‘kept in the family’, in that efforts are made not to cause collateral damage when attacking a rival faction. This is a pragmatic measure as much as anything else –
collateral casualties result in resentment and no faction needs any more enemies than it already has.

Officially, the world is ruled by a charismatic dictator.
However, exactly who this august person may be can change, literally, from one week to the next. Whoever comes out on top of the latest power struggle could be referred to as a charismatic dictator in that he or she enjoys considerable support, at least for the time being. However, the political ground on Entrope shifts alarmingly fast.

This factionalization is one reason why the Entropic Worlds have changed hands so often. The world is capable of constructing powerful defences and a viable system squadron; certainly enough to prevent casual annexation. However, some factions are pro-Darrian, others pro-Sword Worlds and still more sufficiently anti-
the others that they would rather side with offworlders than see rivals in power.

The current dictator’s faction has held power more or less constantly since 1084, although there have been several leaders in that time. Revolutions and counter-
coups have been put down with assistance from Sword World troops but not always quickly or easily. At present, the ruling faction is presenting the Sword Worlders as offworld allies invited to help deal with dangerous rebels wrecking Entropic society, a polite fiction that makes occupation more acceptable. There are as many who actively welcome enforced membership of the Sword Worlds Confederation as oppose it.

Annexation, conquest or liberation by either the Darrians or Sword Worlders has always been accompanied by internal conflict and usually a coup. This has resulted in a great deal of destruction over the years and some appalling tragedies, such as the breach of city segments during political infighting.

The starport was a casualty of the 1084 Sword Worlds takeover and a short bombardment wrecked the facility.
Although it could be rebuilt using salvaged materials, occupation forces and the current ‘popular dictator’ have not made this a priority. The Sword Worlders annexed a former industrial spaceport for their military use and do not permit access to any other vessels. Non Sword-World ships must land among the rubble of the former port and make do as best they can.

The outer system represents rich, if hazardous, pickings for salvage crews. The wreckage of battles for control of orbital space can be tracked and wrecks can be a lucrative source of under-the-counter military components as well as more legitimate salvage. The problem is that not only is salvage work in space a dangerous business but the Sword Worlders in particular take a dim view of unauthorized salvage, seeing it as desecration of the graves of honorable dead. Despite this, military salvage goes on and the proceeds often turn up in the seedier starports of the Sword Worlds themselves. At present, the gains outweigh the risks.

One problem with salvage in the Entrope system is that the system has no gas giants, so obtaining fuel without visiting the starport can be a problem. A jump-2 ship can carry enough fuel to make two jump-1s but the usual solution is to melt ice from a suitable asteroid in the system’s belt, then go looking for a suitable wreck with full tanks. This allows a fast escape in the event of a patrol passing by.

Although unlikely, this has happened from time-to-time.
More worrying are tales of salvage crews closing with a wreck only to find that it is not derelict at all but the shattered remains of a previous salvage vessel. Whether these tales are true and whether the victims were destroyed by patrols, in disputes with other salvagers, or by some other means is cause for nervous speculation.

PRINX Located on the outer spinward edge of the Marches, Prinx is a small world with a very thin atmosphere that is borderline-breathable to humans at sea level; that is to say, a person without a compressor mask could function for a short period before collapsing. During this time, which would be acutely uncomfortable, the victim would display increasingly severe symptoms of altitude sickness such as confusion, nausea and dizziness.
Local animals, such as they are, have adapted to these conditions or evolved in them and are not affected.

The local wildlife is somewhat limited. There are no birds or other flying creatures; the air is too thin to support them. Most larger animals are water-breathers, with few species on land. These are mostly primitive crawling creatures, with few species larger than a cat or small dog.

Much of Prinx’ surface is entirely uninhabitable.
With such a thin atmosphere, mountains tend not to be eroded and remain sharp-toothed barriers to exploration. There is less soil than on worlds with thicker atmospheres and while this does not greatly affect life in the valleys, highlands tend to be stark and rugged, with little or no vegetation. The surface temperature is also

low on average, so that in many areas seas freeze to a considerable depth and ice caps cover the land, greatly reducing usable real estate available to humans.

The settlement of Prinx was a classic example of a landgrab that could not be properly supported. The colonists arrived after a long and difficult journey and began setting up home on their new world which, if not outright hostile, was not as welcoming as the mission planners had believed. At least one follow-up mission arrived before the project was curtailed and resources diverted to opening up more rewarding worlds.

As a result, the colonists on Prinx were left to go their own way. They did reasonably well, creating a stable society that gradually expanded to cover an entire subcontinent. Over the centuries, the population grew slowly until the present-day level of several million inhabitants was reached. Equilibrium was reached some time ago and, with no population pressure to force expansion, movement outward came to a complete halt.

The subcontinent today know as Lesser Dantterland is well settled and ‘tamed’ for agriculture and there are scattered settlements across Greater Dantterland. The rest of the planet is uninhabited and virgin territory.

Within Lesser Dantterland, government is by a semi-
hereditary ruling caste descended from the original colony leaders. Succession is only semi-hereditary as a ruler can adopt several unrelated individuals into his or her household, who are thereafter considered to be family and eligible for nomination as heirs, representatives and holders of high office; heirs are less often blood relatives than adopted household members for a variety of complex social reasons.

Prinx was settled by Imperials and, much later, became nominally part of the Consulate. Today, it is once again independent, although most of the population are not aware of the difference. Zhodani merchant ships (and the odd military patrol) out of Sansibar come through the port from time-to-time. Imperial ships are less common, although they are not unknown and Darrian vessels are increasingly frequent.

Some of these ships are en route elsewhere, others come to trade. Offworld trade is not critically important to the economy of Prinx, although it brings in luxury goods and hard cash in return for a range of plant products and minerals.

Darrian ships used to be very rare in Prinxport but since the middle of the 1050s long-range vessels have begun arriving, coming for three distinct purposes, most commonly to trade; this seems odd, since reaching Prinx

from Darrian space requires a jump-3 vessel and the operators surely cannot be making money on their trips.
Yet still they come.

Other ships pass through and onto Foreven sector to spinward, presumably headed for the coreward end of the sector. The third group appear to be exploration vessels.
They stop at Prinxport, then conduct surveying operations over the uninhabited continents of the planet. Queries about what these vessels are looking for are met with politely vague answers about ‘ongoing survey projects’

and ‘researching planetary crust behaviour’ that do not serve to enlighten and are obviously not meant to.

Whatever the Darrians may be up to on Prinx, the locals are not bothered by it. The Darrian crews that come through Prinxport are friendly and courteous, bring in a little offworld cash and do no harm while they are there.
If they want to go surveying ice sheets or mountain ranges, that is their business. The locals have all the land they need and a fair bit more; the rest of the planet is somebody else’s problem.

### Spinward Marches F

Vilis is a border region, with a little less than half of its worlds being Imperial members. The spinward border is more or less open, since space in that direction is pretty much neutral. Any threat from spinward-coreward is mitigated by the worlds of the Jewell Cluster (in the Jewell subsector) flanking any Zhodani advance through non-aligned systems in that direction.

However, there is a threat from rimward in the form of the Sword Worlds, who have aligned with the Zhodani on several occasions, guiding strategic thinking to some extent. However, the distribution of star systems in Vilis subsector provides a ‘firebreak’ to trailing, ensuring any defeat in Vilis is likely to be a local one.

Preventing such a defeat is the responsibility of the 193 rd Fleet, based out of Frenzie, Denotam and Mirriam.
Its most likely opponents are the Sword Worlds, whose ships have lower jump capability than the Consulate.
Against less mobile fleets, a strategy of static defence is possible and the 193rd maintains a number of guardship deployments in the form of non-jump-capable monitors supported by tenders but unable to redeploy on their own.

Apart from a single BatRon held at Frenzie as a deterrent, Sector Fleet deployments in Vilis are mainly light units in destroyer and light cruiser classes. Such vessels are considered entirely adequate to deal with border incidents with the technologically inferior Sword Worlds and patrol the Abyss Rift. The Navy is also responsible for maintaining communications with the research station at Retinae and showing the Imperial Sunburst in the neutral ports of Querion.

The world designated 728-907 has been catalogued for a long time but was only recently properly surveyed. It possesses a viable ecosphere with vegetation and insect life but no higher animals have been detected and the world has been passed to Imperial Colonial Office
(ICO) administration with a view to colonization in the next few decades. Some interest has been seen from megacorporations, notably Sternmetal Horizons, but nothing concrete has yet emerged.

Asgard is Red Zoned and has been for many years.
As usual the reason for this has not been released by the authorities but the presence of a low-tech culture suggests that the protection of the locals or visiting Imperials is likely to be the reason.

The worlds of the spinward-coreward corner of the subsector are gradually coming under sway of a loose alliance usually referred to as the Federation of Arden.
As yet this is unofficial but a formal alliance seems to be emerging. Since Arden lies between Imperial and Zhodani holdings, these worlds are of strategic interest and an additional player entering the game is a cause for concern.

ARDEN Arden is a moderate sized world with a thin atmosphere and rather scanty coverage of surface water. Although not optimal, this was sufficient to make Arden a strong candidate for colonization. Consequently, large numbers of settlers arrived in the early years of Imperial expansion into the Marches.

Arden prospered but did not thrive. The population gradually increased to the modern level of some 1.03 billion but the world never quite became an economic or industrial powerhouse. Nevertheless, a solid TL9 economy emerged, finding markets for its goods among lower-tech worlds nearby.

Along the way, Arden’s governmental structure ossified.
Although officially government personnel are elected, in practice they can only be elected from among the ranks of the Arden Society, a select group whose members earn their place through financial contributions or service to the ideals of the society.

The Arden Society is dedicated to making Arden a major player on the interstellar stage and works steadily towards that goal. It controls the government of Arden and a number of industrial or economic bodies, and in recent years has begun to spread its net beyond Arden itself.

The society has openly imperialist aspirations and is working to create a Federation of Arden from businesses and shipping lines. In time, this Federation will, its members hope, include the governments of nearby worlds. Although the project is in its infancy, already the Federation has major business assets on close worlds and is in a position to influence the making of policy.

The Federation is particularly influential on Caloran and on Zircon and Utoland in the Jewell subsector.

On Caloran, a steady takeover of agricultural-related businesses is underway but, rather than targeting the farms and landowners themselves, the Federation is insinuating itself into the food-processing industry
(such as it is) and edging out local operators with machinery and techniques from Arden. The farmers can continue to raise crops as before but what passes through the port for export is increasingly under the control of the Federation.

Both Zircon and Utoland are rated as ‘non-industrial’ by the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service but Arden-backed industrial concerns, operated by personnel brought in for the purpose, are operating on both worlds. The aim is to corner the market in industrial production and make the planetary economies dependent on Arden-owned factories. Thus far, the strategy seems to be paying off.

Agents of the Federation of Arden are active on other worlds too, seeking opportunities for strategic investment that can later be converted into political influence. In short, Arden is building a political alliance by creating economic dependency.

On Arden itself, extremely strict laws and bureaucratic procedures are in place. Enforcement is efficient and vigorous, not least because the Arden Society uses laws its officials pass to keep prospective rivals from making any credible challenge. Meanwhile, the world is undergoing steady industrial growth, accompanied by investment in an expanded technological base.

Arden is especially interested in starship technology.The Starport is Class B. It can't build starships. Although government yards nearby can maintain, repair and service them using imported parts. Several Arden-
based businesses own and operate starships, and the government has acquired a respectable system squadron as well as a handful of small jump-capable warships.
Expanding either the military or commercial fleets much further will require an indigenous shipbuilding capability, which is at present beyond the investment capability of Arden. However, the fledgling Federation is strategically located in neutral space between the Imperium and Consulate, and it is possible that the Federation may play one off against the other to obtain investment or assistance in necessary industries.

Arden (and its Federation) is neither hostile nor friendly towards the Imperium. The same rules are imposed on Imperial ships as on independents passing through.
These include import tariffs and other practices not permitted within the Imperium and are not levied against businesses friendly to Arden. A number of free

trader captains have come to an agreement with Arden, trading nominal membership in the Federation for the waiving of tariffs. This ability to conduct preferential trade makes membership attractive to ships plying the local spacelanes, although it is not clear what the price tag will eventually be.

EDININA Edinina is a moon of the very small gas giant Karimissaak, whose name is often translated as
‘Laughable’. The mainworld has an eccentric orbit that takes it through Karimissaak’s feeble ring system, causing meteor showers and dangerous levels of radiation. Despite this, the world is home to a few hundred souls, most of whom are employed in petrochemical extraction from the gas giant’s upper atmosphere. The Industrial Collective of Edinina, to give the world’s highly democratic society its proper title, has contracts with Imperial corporations that send refinery ships every few months. Other than these regular contacts, the system receives few visitors.

A desultory campaign to have the Amber travel classification removed (awarded due to the conditions on the mainworld and surely well deserved) has been undertaken by low-end lawyers at the courts of the sector’s senior nobles. Those few ships that do pass through are routinely pestered to join the campaign, which the locals rather optimistically hope will open up their world to immigration and investment.

### GARDA-VILIS

Garda-Vilis was originally named Tanoose when it was settled in -121 but the colony ran into problems which became steadily worse until the situation could at best be described as disastrous. The government of the nearby world of Vilis came to the rescue and bailed out the failing colony, at the price of becoming a possession of Vilis. The world’s name was changed to Garda-Vilis, which means ‘New Vilis’ in one of the local dialects.

Ever since, Garda-Vilis has been exploited to the benefit of nearby Vilis. Agriculture was encouraged but heavy industry kept under strict control. Today, all major industrial operations are owned by Vilis, keeping the colony economically dependent.

The world itself is large, with a tainted atmosphere and extensive ocean coverage. This still leaves plenty of room for the populace, numbering somewhat more than 470 million. The majority dwell on the world’s largest continent, mostly around the coasts.

The major population centre and capital has grown up around the world’s large downport, which also serves a small Imperial scout base. The latter is important as a communications link back into the Imperium via Frenzie, Denotam, and thereby into Lanth, and as a base of operations for Scout Service vessels in the region.

The government of Garda-Vilis takes the form of administrative apparatus answering to Vilis itself. The world is run by a council of Vilis army officers and this is not popular. A rebellion in 1103 was put down by the council, at the cost of what remaining public sympathy the colonial administration still had. Today the only pro-
government group on Vilis is the population dwelling in and around the capital, as many of these individuals are employed by the starport or its associated industries.

There is a strong independence movement on Garda-
Vilis, calling itself the Tanoose Freedom League
(TFL). The harsh measures used in 1103 drove the TFL underground for a time but increased its base of sympathisers. It has become apparent that some outside agency is smuggling advanced weapons to the TFL and providing training to insurgent units.

The TFL maintains that it is loyal to the Imperium and wants to bring a free Garda-Vilis (or more accurately, a world named Tanoose) into the Imperium. In 1083 the anti-Imperial terrorist Ine Givar organization approached the TFL with offers of alliance. The bodies of the Ine Givar agents were found outside the scout base. This was taken as a reminder of both the TFL’s pro-Imperial stance and its rejection of the Ine Givar proposal.

The region around Garda-Vilis is of interest not only to the Imperium but also the Consulate, Sword Worlds and fledgling Federation of Arden. There have been hints that one or all of these foreign states was interested in events on Garda-Vilis, and it is possible that the TFL might align itself with a foreign power if offered a real chance at independence.

Thus far, the rebellion on Garda-Vilis has been treated as an internal matter and Imperial Army forces have not been deployed. Were foreign influences found to be involved, that policy might be revised. In the meantime, the ruling council is stretched very thin. Local forces have been deemed untrustworthy and disarmed, leaving the administration desperately short of manpower at a time of deepening crisis.

Various measures have been suggested to mitigate the situation, ranging from the use of mercenary forces to augment the Vilis Civil Affairs troops, a Navy guardship to intercept arms shipments or the appointment of an Imperial noble to represent the world. The latter was vigorously rebuffed by the government of Vilis - colonies do not have their own representatives, they are looked after by their parent world. Assigning a representative would be a step towards recognizing Garda-Vilis as an independent world and this is not acceptable to the government that has benefited from having it as a colony for 1,000 years or more.

The situation on Garda-Vilis continues to simmer, sometimes violently. With the majority of the population opposed to offworld rule, and not greatly benefiting from it, and a ready supply of weapons available for the use of rebels, it would seem to be only a matter of time before things come to a head.

#### Ine Givar

The Ine Givar is considered to be a terrorist organization but the truth is more complex. The movement began as a peaceful attempt to obtain democratic reform in Imperial territory and still maintains a pro-democracy stance. However, elements of the movement lost patience long ago and began to resort to more dramatic means.

There are, broadly speaking, three philosophies within Ine Givar membership, peaceful reform, honorable struggle and any-means-necessary.  Not all of those taking the latter position support terrorism. Some have aligned themselves with Zhodani or Sword World intelligence agencies or have moved from wanting to promote democratic reform to simply opposing the Imperium.

The Ine Givar movement has become an umbrella for insurgencies on various worlds, anti-Imperial terrorism, organised crime and peaceful leaflet campaigns. Membership is proscribed by Imperial edict but not automatically assumed to mean that members are guilty of terrorism. However, the threat of prosecution is a useful tool in obtaining cooperation from captured members, who are a major source of intelligence for the Imperial authorities. The Ine Givar movement has responded to this threat by increasing compartmentalization of an already splintered organization. There are some who believe there is no longer a central leadership and that local groups are essentially independent despite claiming loyalty.

SAURUS Saurus is a border world, strategically significant only in that it provides a jump-2 link from Sword World space towards Lanth. It is an entirely habitable world that has remained undeveloped partially for lack of trade links passing through and partly due to a combination of local factors.

Saurus was named for the great variety of reptilian life encountered by early explorers. Some creatures are very large, posing a threat to farms and settlements within their territory but the most notable reptiles are a minor race catalogued as Saurians by Imperial researchers. Their own name for their species is difficult to pronounce so the nickname has become universal.

Human colonists arrived on Saurus before the native inhabitants were identified as sentient and claimed areas of the planet with a stable TL7 society, which incorporates significant numbers of Saurians as workers. These ‘humanised’ Saurians operate vehicles and machines at a basic level but are insufficiently

Creating Saurian Travellers Saurians are more heavily built than the average human, warm-blooded and omnivorous. They have advanced to full sentience, albeit not very highly intelligent compared to humans, and are capable of abstract thought and clever innovation.

Although they have a hunter culture, Saurians are peaceable and friendly towards others. They are quite accepting of strangers even if they belong to a species the Saurians have never seen.
Saurians are capable of great violence and some serve as guards or soldiers in human settlements.
They are not reluctant to fight but have a strong sense of what is necessary and what is not.

Characteristics Saurian Travellers have the following modifiers applied to their characteristics: STR+2, END+2.
They roll 2D3 to determine INT and 1D to determine EDU.

Traits Saurian Travellers all possess the following traits:
Armor (+2): Saurians have thick, scaly skin that can shrug off light blows without a scratch. They have natural armor Protection +2.

Careers The following careers from the Traveller Core Rulebook are all suitable for Saurians: Citizen
(worker), Drifter (barbarian, wanderer).

intelligent to be safe without supervision. ‘Like a Saurian in an air/raft’ is a local figure of speech for well-meaning ineptitude.

There are larger numbers of native Saurians living all over the planet. Those dwelling close to human-dominated settlements trade for tools and can be quite inventive in their use.
More distant groups are still living as they were when humans arrived, using well-made stone and wooden tools. A number of scientific expeditions have visited Saurus, observing the influence of a more advanced society on the developing Saurians.

# LANTH - SPINWARDS MARCHES-SUBSECTOR G

![[BtC-LanthSubsector.jpg]]
Lanth has two contrasting regions. Most of the subsector is very sparse but the coreward and trailing edges are dominated by the Spinward Main, which branches at Tureded. Traffic bound for Rhylanor and beyond heads coreward-trailing while the primary arm of the Main loops away to spinward, giving access to Regina, Jewell, Vilis and, ultimately, Querion.

As a consequence of its strategic position, Tureded sees a great deal of traffic coming through its small port, more than the minor installation can really deal with. An upgrade is long overdue and has been delayed by the independent nature of the locals, who are not keen on an influx of offworlders even if they arrive with buckets

of cash. It is likely that the port will be expanded soon whatever the locals think of the idea, causing friction between the existing population and those who come to work at the expanded facility.

Traffic on the Spinward Main is considerable but the rest of the subsector is inaccessible to ships capable of less than jump-3 or 4 capability; although the x-boat route and naval patrols can cross the subsector quickly, commercial traffic has to take the long way round. The sparse area in the spinward and rimward ends of the subsector is known as the Abyss Rift and seems to deserve its somewhat dramatic name.

LANTH SUBSECTOR

### Spinward Marches

### G

Curious jump-related phenomena have been reported in this region for centuries, often by reliable witnesses.
Scout Service x-boat pilots plying the Trans-Abyss Rift route have filed reports ranging from radio signals received (impossible) to ‘something on the hull, trying to get in’ (positively crazed) while in jumpspace, begging the question of whether someone who has spent a week alone in jumpspace is a reliable witness or not.

Despite the bad reputation of the region, the main naval bases for the subsector fleet (the 18th) and those elements of the Sector Fleet deployed to the Lanth subsector are located in the Abyss Rift or along its edge at Ivendo, D’Ganzio, Lanth and Ghandi.

All worlds in Lanth are Imperial members. Five (Wypoc, Quopist, Rech, Rhise, and Sonthert) are Amber Zoned at present for various reasons. There are also three Red Zones of which two (Ylaven, and Victoria) lie within the

The Abyss Rift The Abyss Rift is an unofficial designation given to a region of space lying spinward of the Spinward Main as it runs through the Lanth subsector.
Its actual extent is nebulous; some include the trailing parts of Vilis, others consider that only the region around Victoria and Sonthert is the Abyss and the surrounding region of low stellar density is just a normal rift.

The Abyss Rift is associated with jumpspace phenomena and a higher than average rate of misjumps. Much of what is ‘known’ about the rift is speculation based upon tales told in starport bars but statistically there is a higher tendency for ships to misjump or suffer mishaps in the region.
The idea that the rift is a bad place does seem to have some scientific basis.

The Abyss Rift is an example of a jumpspace trench (see The Great Rift ), an area where jumpspace is ‘deeper’ and subject to different physical laws. The vast majority of ships traversing the region will suffer no ill effects but you may never convince a superstitious Traveller that they are safe.

Abyss Rift. A certain segment of the population takes this as additional proof that the rift is a very bad place where awful things happen.

The fourth Red Zone, Djinni, is an uninhabited but apparently habitable world on the Spinward Main and the Red Zone makes access to Yori in Regina problematical for jump-1 ships. Vessels approaching the world are warned off and directed to the system’s gas giants to skim fuel. Those that cannot do this are permitted to refuel from a small tanker kept on standby for the purpose, although they are charged over the odds for the privilege. As usual, the Imperial authorities are not forthcoming about why they go to such trouble to keep visitors away from Djinni.

DINOM Dinom is a typical rockball world, a member of the Imperium under the governance of the Dinom Corporation. Settled for economic reasons, it is officially listed as an oligarchy in the IISS database but could be considered a corporate state in which the main shareholders and owners of facilities form a planetary nobility.

The planetary economy is based on mining and ore processing, and the owners of the major ore-handling plants, mines and industrial facilities more or less constitute the government. The World Board, as it is known, has some representation for those who are not shareholders in the main economic assets of the world and for the small populations dwelling outside the main cities but, for the most part, their voices are drowned out by the major shareholders in the Dinom Corporation.

Orbiting a considerable distance from a very bright star, Dinom is far too small to retain an atmosphere of any kind and therefore lacks liquid water. It is a quasi-moon, once belonging to the system’s gas giant. Having been perturbed out of its orbit, it was captured in the gas giant’s trailing Trojan point and follows the bigger planet around in its orbit.

Dinom rotates at the same rate as it orbits its star, little more than a small bright disc in the sky. The star puts out enough energy to make the surface pointed towards it very hot, while the opposite side is exposed to the cold of space. Dinom thus has a ‘bright face’ and a ‘cold face’, as well as a zone of twilight where temperatures are less extreme. All major settlements are built in this zone.

There are three major cities on Dinom, with a total population of less than 250,000. Most live and work in these cities, which are connected by a monorail link or, rather, will be connected ‘very soon’. The monorail system has been due for completion ‘very soon’ for an inordinately long time and cynics suggest it will never be completed.

There are an unfortunately large number of cynics on Dinom. Although wages are good, many people are ceasing to see Dinom as a place to earn a salary and instead consider it their home. This shift has increased disaffection among the populace, who (probably correctly) believe Dinom Corporation is all about wringing profit out of the world rather than looking after the interests of the people who live there.

At present, the unrest takes the form of grumbling, labour disputes over minor issues that would have been ignored or cleared up in minutes just a few years ago, along with the occasional strike. The World Board has made a number of concessions to the workers but has not addressed major issues regarding Dinom-as-home rather than Dinom-as-workplace.

The World Board believes it is simply not cost-effective to implement social programmes and improve Dinom as a place to live. In this, they too are probably correct.
The Dinom Corporation looks after its workers well enough but does not see the need to consider long-term development of the world.

There are those who have begun suggesting that what Dinom needs is a change of government. This hypothetical new government would allow the Dinom Corporation to continue its operations but would spend much more on long-term social development. The World Board is unlikely to accept this proposal and, in any case, it is unworkable. The money for these programmes would have to come from the only real source of wealth on the planet – the Dinom Corporation.

While the major processing works are located in the equatorial cities, there are small settlements a short way into the cold and bright faces. The only reasons to venture outside the relatively safe equatorial zone are economic. On the cold face, there are veins and deposits of minerals to be dug out of the ground and it is possible to extract frozen gases from deposits. These are purified and shipped in solid form or piped as liquids back to processing centres for industrial use.

Operating on the cold face is hazardous. In addition to the dangers of an airless world such as dust pools that seem only centimetres deep, micrometeorite showers and the occasional deep crevasse, super-cold terrain has its own unique ways to harm unwary Travellers.

Cold face hazards include lakes of frozen gas that rapidly sublimate when exposed to heat, such as that given off by an ATV. Deep crevasses are also present, where rock has been split by explosive sublimation in the past, when a deposit of frozen gas is exposed to heat.

The bright face is, if anything, more dangerous.
However, the extremely high temperatures are beneficial in some ways when mining for metals.
Conventional mining is carried out and there are other, less commonplace, ways to obtain minerals in this environment. It is possible to encounter pools of liquid metal that can simply be piped into holding tanks.
These metals tend to be those with a lower melting point but pool-draining is a quick way to obtain a large amount of metal. The occasional geyser of molten metal is far more hazardous, although if the period of the geyser can be predicted it is possible to send in teams to harvest clumps of solidified metal after an eruption.
This is dangerous but has the advantage that metal so obtained tends to be very pure.

K’KIRKA KKirka is, to most starfarers, little more than a stopover on the Spinward Main. Marketing materials proclaim it as the ‘last good port before Regina’, which is highly inaccurate but refers to the cluster of Amber and Red Zones that must be traversed before reaching more salubrious surroundings. The port itself is nothing special, although its traders play on the ‘difficult run ahead’
theme to sell overpriced starship spares and luxury items imported from further along the Spinward Main.

K’Kirka is primarily a mining colony, featuring a small population working largely automated mine sites scattered around the globe, with the port acting as economic hub. The world has two unusually dense moons and an extensive collection of captured asteroidal debris, all of which moves in an incredibly complex but somehow stable pattern. It is virtually impossible for this to have occurred naturally; the current, most popular, theory is that the system was set up this way as some sort of astrophysics experiment conducted on a huge scale, probably by the Ancients.

VICTORIA Victoria lies in the Abyss Rift, just off the Lanth-Ghandi-
Dinomn x-boat route. It is one of three Red Zoned worlds in the subsector and maintained by Imperial Navy vessels out of Lanth or Ghandi. There is almost always a guardship in the vicinity of the world, plus interdiction satellites that monitor traffic. Occasionally, additional vessels sweep other parts of the system, probably as part of the Navy’s routine internal security operation.

The guardship is usually a small vessel such as a patrol cruiser or close escort. The subsector fleet has a huge section of the Spinward Main to patrol and the Sector Fleet is mainly concerned with the Sword Worlds, just a few parsecs away. Neither can spare large numbers of vessels to monitor an unimportant planet in the middle of nowhere.

Victoria is a very old world orbiting a venerable star, deficient in heavy minerals and metals. Despite this, it has a dense atmosphere, which carries a taint capable of defeating most conventional filters. Fortunately, this taint exists mainly at low altitudes and above 1,000 metres the atmosphere is safe to breathe. Below this, an oxygen supply or fully sealed environment suit is needed.

The human population numbers about 10 million, dwelling on high ground in a region known as the Mesas. There is no world government; different groups have their own way of doing things that can range from oligarchies and dictatorships to democracies and even voluntary anarchy.

The Law Level 2 is an estimated average. Some areas have very strict laws; most do not. Similarly, technology varies from place-to-place, although always limited by the scarcity of metals. Balloons and dirigibles, sometimes powered by hand-cranked propellers, have made travel possible between areas previously cut off by low ground.

Victoria was probably colonized around -1450 and isolated for a long time. Even after the Imperium settled the Marches, the world received few visitors as a result of its remote location. In 901, the IISS made a survey of the world and shortly afterward a Red Zone was declared. While the Navy does not discuss the reasons for Red Zoning, the Scout Service is a little more forthcoming. In the case of Victoria, the given reason was to protect the people of the world from outside influence as they struggled to deal with their metal-poor environment.

However, there is something else interesting about Victoria and this may be why the Navy monitors the Red Zone rather than Scouts, although Scout vessels do sometimes visit. Normally, a Red Zone imposed at the request of the Scout Service is monitored by their vessels and personnel; the reasons are usually protective or scientific. Navy-monitored Red Zones are normally for political or security reasons, or to keep people away from an area of strategic importance to the Imperium.

Around 300,000 years ago, at a time coinciding with the disappearance of the Ancients, Victoria was heavily bombarded from space by asteroids used as deadfall ordnance, the technical term for dropping a heavy object from orbit. The bombardment resulted in immense craters, some of which are seas or great lakes today.
Others are not obvious, as they lie on the seabed. The Mesas area was caused by a strike that cracked the planetary crust and caused lava to surge up before cooling, creating the unusual pattern of high areas separated by chasms, which are quite deep but often only 500-2,000m wide.

The best asteroids for planetary bombardment are rocky or, better, nickel-iron cored ones. Thus, significant deposits of metal are probably present at the centre of

each crater. However, most craters are now submerged and all lie below the taint level, making access extremely difficult. Some craters have a central upraised point (a common feature of large impact craters) and these could be found and mined more easily. However, the great distances involved mean that such an expedition is far beyond the means of the local population.

It is possible to obtain a permit to visit Victoria, although not by any easy means. Such a permit includes strict clauses about trading metal or metal goods to the locals and specifically prohibits access to Victoria’s moon, Albert. Permits make it perfectly clear that permission to visit the moon has not been granted and that lethal force may be used, without warning, against any vessel approaching it. No explanation for this has ever been given.

Albert is large enough to have an atmosphere and appears to even have surface water. It is officially listed as uninhabited but there have been reports of a stone-built (or, more fancifully, ‘crystalline’) city on the surface. Official charts make no mention of this, nor of any colonization effort or history of habitation on Albert.

Like most vehicles on Victoria, this example is a one-off build. It consists of a large gasbag under which is slung a propulsion gondola and crew accommodation pod. The latter has a set of bunks and a galley capable of serving the crew. The vessel normally operates with a crew of

TL2

DESCRIPTION

16-20, with crewmembers hot bunking, sleeping in shifts when they are not working. The galley serves a very limited selection of high-energy foods, capable of sustaining the crew throughout their voyage.

Propulsion is by means of hand-cranked propellers. The main propeller is directly aft of the working gondola, just beyond the end of the gasbag, supplemented by four steerable propellers that provide some manoeuvring capability. Landing is typically an all-hands-to-the-cranks affair, with the whole crew operating propellers under the direction of the vessel’s master.

The main propeller is shaft-driven from a flywheel, which is brought up to speed gradually and with great effort, despite a gearing ratio designed to make it possible for even a single person to eventually build up some momentum. Once the flywheel is in motion, it essentially stores energy for the propeller to use at need and it is theoretically possible to spend a long time accelerating the flywheel, then make a flight with a minimal crew aboard.

Lying close to the Mora subsector, the longest-developed part of the Marches, and also the established industries of Deneb, Rhylanor is a prosperous area that sees a considerable amount of commercial traffic. One reason for this is that every world in the subsector is on the Spinward Main or accessible from it using a jump-2 vessel. Indeed, a jump-2 ship can leave Belizo and

make a circuit through the Mora, Lunion and Lanth subsectors, all the way through to Celepina before crossing back to Belizo via Jae Tellona.

Rhylanor has a long naval connection and was the birthplace of Admiral Olav hault-Plankwell, victor of the First Frontier War and instigator of the Civil War.

RHYLANOR SUBSECTOR

### Spinward Marches

### H

Unusually, the Spinward Marches does not have a system named Depot like most Imperium-dominated sectors. Macene is the largest and most important naval base in the sector and may eventually be expanded to a full Imperial Navy depot. At that time the name may or may not be changed.

The subsector is defended by the 23rd Fleet based out of Rhylanor, Jae Tellona, Macene, Margesi and Nutema naval bases, and there are heavy elements of the Sector Fleet including several BatRons and CruRons held in reserve at Macene.

Rhylanor subsector has a number of corporate bases, notably at Rhylanor itself. These include shipyards and manufacturing centres as well as research installations. The Imperium maintains a research station
(designated Gamma) at Vanejen, located in a remote area of the planet.

There are three Red Zones: Gerome, Huderu and 457-

973. Conspiracy theorists keep trying to link the latter

with the research station at Vanejen but this seems unlikely as the Imperium would place its station at a location within the interdicted system if there were something needing to be studied.

Kegena is currently Amber Zoned. This low-tech world recently suffered a major social upheaval and governmental collapse. A temporary administration is now in place courtesy of the Colonial Office, and backed up by the Army, but the situation remains volatile and caution is advised.

The atmosphere of Pannet makes it hazardous to visit but contains a number of useful compounds, which are extracted for use by heavy industry. Several companies offer very good wages for hostile-environment qualified personnel to work in the extraction process.

The belt at Gitosy is unusual in that it is spherical; the orbits of the asteroids that make up the belt are not confined to the ecliptic but proceed at all angles.
However, most are ice fragments and potentially habitable rocky asteroids are mainly found in the ecliptic plane or in only slightly eccentric orbits.

GILEDEN Gileden is a rather peculiar little world, with a denser atmosphere than its low surface gravity might normally produce. This has not prevented the world from taking a pounding in the past, with extensive evidence of asteroid

impacts in its distant past. There are those who claim that the world was given its dense atmosphere by the Ancients and then bombarded in their Final War, yet the impacts vastly predate any known starfaring species.

The mystery is compounded by the composition of the asteroids; the impact craters are still very obvious and their centres tend to have high concentrations of unusual minerals. It is possible that the bodies that made these craters came from outside the Gileden system, although how that might come to pass is unknown. A wild tale surfaced some years ago about part of an extremely old sublight colony ship – carved out of an asteroid – which was found in deep space near Gileden.

Gileden is home to a handful of ‘official’ residents, mostly starport workers who decided to stay permanently and changed their citizenship. Much larger numbers of personnel work on Gileden but do not call it home.
Some work the port, some are scientists studying the impact sites or unusual atmosphere conditions, and some are prospectors hoping to make a big strike in one of the craters.

RHYLANOR Rhylanor is a small world with a very thin atmosphere located in a cluster of three star systems just off the Spinward Main. As such, it provides a useful short cut for high-jump vessels and x-boats but is somewhat inaccessible to commercial ships. The majority of traffic into Rhylanor comes via the Celepina-Jae Tellona link or from Fulacin to Porozlo. Access to the subsector capital was one reason for the construction of an excellent Class A starport at the otherwise unimportant world of Fulacin.

Rhylanor is home to several billion people, mostly human, and has a moderate society with liberal laws.
Entry to the world’s ruling elite by those not born to the right families is not easy but it is possible to join the ruling class by a variety of methods, the most common through power and achievement.

Elevation through power is simply a recognition of the influence an individual already wields. Usually this means business interests, ownership of industrial assets and the like but in some cases individuals who have risen to lead political or social groups have been elevated to the ruling class. There are those who suggest that rising political stars, who might challenge the establishment are encouraged to sell out and join the existing system; others maintain that Rhylanor

is a meritocracy where those who deserve a say in government are given it.

Elevation for achievement is generally linked with service to the Imperium or Rhylanor’s armed forces.
Retired naval, marine and army officers are frequently offered generous inducements to take up government posts or simply be associated with the government as advisors and public supporters. Achievements in other areas, such as science or entertainment, are also rewarded in this way, ensuring that Rhylanor attracts the best and brightest.

Rhylanor’s most famous citizen was Grand Admiral Olav hault-Plankwell, who not only defeated the Outworld Coalition in the First Frontier War but advanced on Capital and took the throne for himself. This is sometimes described as the ultimate expression of Rhylanor-style meritocracy. Plankwell had achieved great things as a naval officer and wielded great power, fulfilling both requirements for elevation, and deserved to be made part of the ruling elite, perhaps as Archduke of the Domain of Deneb. Empress Jacqueline was foolish not to reward Plankwell’s greatness and paid the price when he took what he deserved by his own efforts.
Reminders that Plankwell did not manage to keep his position very long do not go down well on Rhylanor.

Admiral Plankwell’s birthplace is now a small museum, which attracts large numbers of visitors every year.
This is only one of Rhylanor’s many naval connections; although Macene is home to the heavy units of the Sector Fleet based in the subsector, the subsector fleet itself (the 23rd) has its headquarters at Rhylanor and there is a very powerful system squadron. Rhylanor also boasts a large naval academy where young officers-to-be undergo education and training.

One of the proud traditions of the Rhylanor Naval Academy is the ‘manning the boats’ ceremony held just before graduation of each class of cadets, commemorating the contribution of trainee personnel from the academy to the defence of Rhylanor in the Third Frontier War. Cadets volunteered in huge numbers to crew repaired and reactivated system defence boats from the system’s reserve fleet during the Siege of Rhylanor. Casualties were very high in the dark months of the middle of 981 before the siege was finally broken.
The ceremony is held in memory of their sacrifice and as a reminder to cadets that they have not chosen a cosy, safe occupation.

Rhylanor also has a large Scout Service base, which acts as a communications depot for x-boat routes as well as a regional planning and command centre. The facility is extensive and contains training facilities for some of the more specialized scout roles such as the use of advanced communications equipment and the security teams occasionally called upon to rescue personnel who have found more trouble than they can handle.

Rhylanor, with its large population base and extremely high Tech Level, is also a centre for industry, commerce and education. The Rhylanor Institute of Technology is one of the most prominent hard-science and technological-research institutions in the entire Imperium and almost certainly the foremost facility this side of Corridor.

Several megacorporations have their regional headquarters on Rhylanor or at least a major installation for those who prefer to work out of Mora. Some of Rhylanor’s extensive shipyards are privately owned but most are either megacorporate subsidiaries or partially funded by their money.

Rhylanor’s importance as a communications hub and industrial centre cannot offset the fact that it is difficult to get to. Free traders and similar independent starships are rarely seen in the ports of Rhylanor, Porozlo and Jae Tellona; they tend to stay on the Spinward Main.
The vessels that do come through are for the most part expensive jump-3 liners and freighters running through Eqqus, Celepina and Belizo.

Many of the ships on this route are megacorporate-
owned, although a couple of smaller lines make a decent profit from dedicated vessels plying the trans-Rhylanor routes. The most prominent, Rhylanor Shipping LIC, is heavily subsidised by the government to ensure a regular service. The firm does not operate anywhere else but Imperium Mail LIC does, specialising in high-jump courier and subsidised trade route operations in various parts of the Marches, as well as Deneb.

VANEJEN Vanejen is a moderate-sized planet with a dense atmosphere and about 60% water coverage. Average temperatures are low and about a third of the oceans are frozen or covered by ice caps. Although somewhat sub-
optimal as a place to live, Vanejen can easily support humans. It was settled around -2400 by Vilani colonists but became isolated during the Long Night, falling

back to barbarism before climbing back up to a modest technological base. By the time the Imperium arrived in the Marches, Vanejen had experienced centuries of cultural drift and lost most traditional Vilani habits in favour of a home-grown culture. The population were initially pureblood Vilani and there has been little intermingling over the centuries.

Vanejen lies on the Spinward Main, a less-travelled spur running coreward from Mora. This arm offers jump-
2 access to Jae Tellona and thereby to Rhylanor, or another arm of the main to coreward, but is otherwise unimportant to interstellar trade and political affairs.
This region has been a backwater for centuries and never received much in the way of investment. It might have remained entirely underdeveloped but for the events of the Third Frontier War, which required the Imperial Navy to create a temporary base on Vanejen and brought interstellar affairs onto the locals’ doorstep.

Prior to this, Vanejen was a more or less forgotten colony world, whose inhabitants managed to create a stable TL2 society. Progress beyond that never really happened. Vanejen fell off the map and escaped notice for centuries. Only those locals who interacted with starfarers aboard the few ships that came through were reminded that there was a wider universe out there.

After the war, the Navy kept the base open for a time even though it was no longer needed. Budget constraints resulted in its closure after a few years but by that time

things had changed considerably as a result of offworld influences. When the Navy came to Vanejen they did so carefully, making a number of deals with local leaders.
In return for making the construction of the base easy, the ruling elite were given orbital surveys of mineral deposits and technological assistance in creating an industrial base to exploit them.

In the century since the war, Vanejen has advanced steadily to TL5, with most sectors of industry a monopoly for one of the ruling families; literally all steel production is owned by one family, all land transport by another and so forth. Some sectors, for example sea transport, are divided between several families.

Today, Vanejen has a population of just over 540 million, scattered across three of the world’s four continents, the fourth being barren and more or less uninhabited.
Government is by a stable semi-feudal system based on control of critical industries and the ruling families were firmly entrenched in power even before they gained their monopoly on industry.

Local travel is by rail, for the most part, but sea travel is commonly used for commercial purposes. In the northern hemisphere and equatorial regions, surface ships are the norm but submersibles are used in the southern oceans and particularly stormy or ice-prone areas. Submersibles run on the surface most of the time, submerging to avoid ice or ride out a storm.

The submersibles of Vanejen range from small personal transports to large cargo vessels and run on a diesel-
electric system that can use a snorkel to pull in air while remaining submerged. An explosives-rigged buoy is carried to blast a hole to the surface in pack ice, allowing a boat to halt, recharge its batteries and then proceed on a long under-ice transit. These are not military boats and are unarmed, with a large glassed-
in area forward and powerful searchlights mounted alongside. This allows visually-guided manoeuvring at close range although it does pose a hazard in the event of collision. Most boats are capable of operating at a safe maximum depth of about 200 metres, and can survive at somewhat greater depths.

Vanejen has a substantial population of Chirpers, most living on the northern continent, despite it being less hospitable than the other land masses. This may be because the Chirpers have moved away from humans, although that begs the question of how they crossed the seas to their new home. There are smaller populations of Chirpers on the other continents.

Chirpers dwell in family groups of hunter-gatherers on the human-dominated continents, although there have been sightings of Chirper villages, which are primitive but show signs of agricultural and tool-fabrication skills. They are considered a nuisance, sneaking into settlements to steal food and shiny objects, which they seem to like. They are not wantonly destructive but can cause a fair amount of damage in their ingenious attempts to obtain something they want; usually food but they may be motivated by necessity rather than mischief, it is a problem for the locals.

The humans of Vanejen occasionally mount expeditions to drive Chirpers away from settlements and this has been generally successful. Perhaps not coincidentally, Chirper numbers seem to be falling.

Vanejen is listed as the location of Imperial Research Station Gamma, reported to be a tower-like structure built on the seabed in the far south, projecting up above sea level. It is accessed by grav craft and supply submarines from local contractors. As with all such stations, the station is a local Red Zone; access without a permit is strictly prohibited. It is not known how this is enforced, nor what research goes on inside.

Chirpers are small bird-like humanoids with vestigial wings and a reptilian tail, massing about 25kg and omnivorous in nature. They are semi-intelligent and capable of learning a few simple Galanglic phrases, although they mangle pronunciation horribly. Among themselves they communicate with bird-like chirps, hence their human name.

# DARRIAN - SPINWARDS MARCHES-SUBSECTOR I

The Darrian subsector lies entirely beyond Imperial space, with access requiring either passage through the Sword Worlds Confederation (not always possible)
or transit via an arm of the Spinward Main and into the subsector from Vilis-Querion or District 268-Five Sisters.

The subsector itself is dominated by a 15-world cluster centring on Ilium and Mire, the original area into which the Darrians expanded when they first discovered interstellar travel. Although many of these worlds were cut off for a long period during the aftermath of the

Maghiz , they remained culturally Darrian and were peaceably re-integrated into the Darrian Confederation.

Technically, this cluster lies on the Spinward Main but since access to the rest of the Main requires transiting through the Gram Arm of the Sword Worlds, astrographical convenience is overruled by local politics.
Uniqua and Garoo are also on the Spinward Main, although they lie at the extreme outer end, where the main passes out of the Marches and into Foreven to spinward.

Creating Darrian Travellers Over the centuries, the Darrians adapted to their homeworld, gradually acquiring a distinctive appearance. Although recognizably human and capable of interbreeding with other humans, the Darrians developed what some refer to as an ‘elfin’
appearance. They are tall and slender as a result of the lower gravity on their homeworld and tend to be more dextrous, if a little weaker, than other humans. Their skin has a golden colour and hair is white or silver-grey as a result of living under a different sun for millennia.

Characteristics Darrian Travellers have the following modifiers applied to their characteristics: STR-1, DEX+1, END-1, INT+1, EDU+1.

Traits Darrian Travellers all possess the following traits:
Heat Resistant (-1): Darrians have slightly reflective skin and their bodies retain water more efficiently than other humans. They suffer one point less damage from extremes of temperature in their environment.

Heightened Senses: Darrians have better hearing and sense of smell than other humans. All Darrians receive DM+1 to any Recon or Survival checks they have to make.

Careers The following careers from the Traveller Core Rulebook are all suitable for Darrians: Agent, Entertainer, Merchant, Navy, Scholar. More Darrian careers will be added to Traveller in the future.

The Darrian people love, and are respectful of, life although not to extremes. As a result, the surface of Mire is a wondrously unspoiled environment, as is Rorre, for similar reasons. Rorre was settled by Darrians who disliked technology and preferred a rustic lifestyle.
It was untouched by the Maghiz and life on Rorre continues more or less as it always has.

Torment is a prison world, used by the Darrians as a place to dispose of criminals that even their tolerant society cannot accept, with access prohibited in much the same manner as Imperial Red Zones. Prisoners mine raw materials in return for necessary supplies.

The world of Ilium was terraformed by the Darrians before the Maghiz and retains a slight atmospheric taint despite best efforts to remove it. Another tainted-
atmosphere world is 494-908, which defied the efforts of Darrian terraformers and is used as a military training area, including orbital bombardment. Spume also has a tainted atmosphere; this is compounded by the taint being radioactive as a result of natural volcanism. The population live in a sealed mining settlement.

DARRIAN Darrian is a small world with a standard atmosphere.
Although a little dry, it is entirely habitable by humans and was chosen by the Ancients as home for a transplanted population. Why they were moved to Darrian will probably never be known; the Ancients disappeared soon afterwards and the Darrians were left alone to develop on their new world.

According to Darrian legends and archaeological research, the Darrians lived in a world of gardens approximating the Terran Eden. It would seem that the Ancients created an environment for the population that met all needs and allowed their numbers to grow rapidly without conflict over resources.

Eventually, whatever Ancient devices ran the gardens began to fail, although was a gradual process. The Darrians were forced to spread across their planet and fend for themselves. Fortunately, Darrian was a very welcoming world and the transition was not traumatic.

Perhaps as a result of their comfortable environment, the Darrians developed a great respect for life and their science was channelled into coexistence with the environment rather than fighting it for survival. Science and technology progressed slowly as there was little need for rapid progress, although the Darrians developed intellectual gifts in abstract areas like mathematics and philosophy.

While Darrian is the original home of the Darrian people, it was thoroughly devastated by the solar flares of the Maghiz and never regained its position. Pre- Maghiz structures and artefacts attract many visitors each year as they are of a higher Tech Level than encountered in the Imperium or Consulate. There are strict prohibitions on exporting pre- Maghiz items.

Mire is the modern capital of the Confederation and all settlements are underground in order to preserve the surface for parks, nature reserves and agriculture.

By –1511, the Darrians had developed a peaceful, rational society albeit without much in the way of technology. Everything changed with the arrival of refugees from Earth, arriving on a fleet of ships built by the Itzin Corporation, from Turkey on Old Earth itself. They were fleeing the decline that would lead to the Long Night and made an epic voyage all the way to Deneb before turning spinward and entering the Marches. After surveying Sacnoth, the Itzin fleet chose Darrian as its final destination.

Whatever the new arrivals did next, Darrian and its people were changed forever. However, to the great good fortune of the Darrian people, the newcomers did not make the obvious ‘sky gods’ ploy, nor did they use their superior technology to dominate or marginalise the Darrians. Instead, they made a careful and friendly approach, trading fairly with their new friends who in turn welcomed the Terrans into Darrian society. Change was inevitable but the Darrian people were part of it rather than having it forced upon them.
Within a century, the two cultures had melded into one. The thoughtful, inquisitive nature of the Darrians complemented the energetic and, at times, reckless nature of the newcomers. Working with the technological base the Terrans had brought with them, the new Darrian society began a period of explosive growth and reached TL16 within just 400 years.

Curiosity very nearly killed the metaphorical cat when an experiment on Darrian’s sun Tarnis resulted in the Maghiz , or Chaos. Darrian itself was burned by the resulting explosion of star-hot gases and has never recovered. Most of the population died in the solar flares, or soon afterward, and the remainder were too busy trying to survive to preserve much in the way of technology. The Darrian return to space began in
–275 but on the nearby world of Mire rather than Darrian itself.

Today, Darrian still bears the scars of the Maghiz. There are extensive ruins of former TL16 cites that attract tourists and scientists interest from far afield, as do the remains of what are now normally called ‘orchards’; the Ancients-built gardens that were home to the original Darrian civilization. Trade in artefacts from these sites is strictly controlled.

Modern Darrian has a population numbering in the billions with most living on the surface, contrary to popular images of Darrian as a world of flying cities.
The surface is divided more by mountain ranges than by seas, creating five great basins that are the equivalent of continents. In addition, there are indeed four flying cities, held aloft by gravitic technology. Each has its own unique characteristics and function but together contain only a fraction of the world population.

GAGH-CLASS TRAMP TRADER

The Gagh is a common small merchant or transport vessel optimised for low-cost haulage. Although it has spare cabins when running with a small crew, it is rare to find this vessel carrying passengers in the normal manner. More commonly, the extra cabin space is used for the patron of a charter (or their representative), or as extra living space for the crew.

In addition to being the spiritual home of the Darrian Confederation, this world is also its main technological centre. The IISS designates it TL16 but this is slightly misleading. TL16 artefacts are under study and in some cases duplicated and incorporated into devices as black-box components but the world does not make use of TL16 items on a routine basis. Most of the ultra-
high technology available on planet is in the form of pre- _Maghiz_ artefacts, which are too precious for their scientific value to be used for practical tasks.

Study of pre- _Maghiz_ items, coupled with the Darrians’
natural aptitude for technology, will undoubtedly result in technological growth to surpass that of the Imperium and perhaps even the pre- _Maghiz_ Darrians. However, despite the government of Darrian being composed largely of scientists, restrictions are in place and any potentially hazardous experimentation is very carefully considered before being implemented. The Darrian government is famous for its detailed analysis of the impact of almost every decision on the world and its people.

DORANNIA Dorannia is one of a cluster of three worlds lying just off the Bowman Arm of the Spinward Main and accessible by jump-2 ships from the main or the central cluster of the subsector. None of these worlds is especially important, although Bularia has a reasonable trade in agricultural produce.

Dorannia is an independent world with a population numbering somewhat less than a million. It is administered by a fairly efficient civil service government that follows established patterns in an unimaginative way; laws are strict, largely as a consequence of a harsh environment that can kill the unwary. Mistakes can have terminal consequences for others, too.

The planet is small, with low surface gravity and a very thin atmosphere tainted by radioactive dust.
This requires a compressor mask or full air supply when working outside settlements, along with strict decontamination procedures within the settlements.
The latter tend not to be large, with towns of a few thousand being more common than cities. The towns are each administered by local government, which in turn answers to the central administration at the capital.

Dorannia has very little water and virtually no food production outside of colony domes. Most towns have an area dedicated to food production, which also keeps the air fresh, but few are self-sufficient. Extra foodstuffs are brought in from more specialized settlements, which grow bulk crops in huge environmentally-sealed greenhouses.

Transport between the settlements is by rail or large, slow transport crawlers. Grav vehicles are expensive and Dorannia is not a rich world, so the few available tend to be in the hands of the government or well-off private owners rather than as commercial transport.

Dorannia has little agriculture, air or water, but what it does have is fissionables. The world was originally settled as a mining colony to extract and process radioactive ores and this is the mainstay of its offworld business. However, the remote location of the world makes it a poor choice as a supplier so the mines make a modest profit but never enough to put Dorannia on the economic map.

In recent years, a new industry has emerged on Dorannia.
Rather than simply mining and exporting radioactives, the world’s industrial base now constructs a range of fission-based power systems, including full-sized nuclear powerplants suitable to power a large town or major industrial complex, as well as smaller plants for vehicles and miniature reactors for small-scale applications.

Nuclear fission is a mature technology on Dorannia, which uses reactors to power its towns, industrial centres, railways and even large transport crawlers.
Safety records and reliability are good, although fission power will never be as safe as fusion, nor can fission match the output per unit mass of a fusion plant.
Nevertheless, it is a viable alternative for mid-tech worlds that want a power system maintained with local resources. Thus far, Dorannia’s products have found a few buyers and the future seems promising. A recent campaign run on several worlds invited prospective buyers to visit ‘Atomic Dorannia’ and showcased a range of novel nuclear energy applications.

All is not entirely well on Dorannia, however. The scattered nature of the world’s settlements makes them ideal targets for planetary raiders. These spaceborne thugs either raid settlements for whatever they can grab or else hold them hostage under the guns of their ship, demanding tribute. On a sealed-environment world like Dorannia, the consequences of taking fire could be catastrophic. After a string of raids in 1102-3, one of which wrecked a starport, the government decided to do something about the problem. A mercenary unit comprising an armed merchant ship and associated personnel was hired, providing protection in the short term and advising on the creation of planetary defences for a more permanent solution.

The latter took a form that would simply not be allowed in the Imperium. Batteries of crude nuclear missiles were installed near many settlements, guided by rather basic tracking and fire control equipment.

Dorannia PAD Missiles The Planetary Aerospace Defence missiles used on Dorannia are classed as torpedo-sized weapons, similar to the multi-warhead torpedo found in High Guard (page 32). In theory, they could be fired from a torpedo launcher on a ship but possess some drawbacks when compared to traditional torpedoes.

•  The target acquisition systems of Dorannia leave something to be desired and all attack rolls made by a PAD missile suffers DM-2 (for a total DM-4 when targeting a ship smaller than 2,000 tons).
•  The use of a first stage to boost PAD missiles into orbit mean they cannot target any ship within Adjacent, Close or Short range.
•  Most settlements protected by PAD missiles have 2D silos, each capable of launching a missile every combat round. Larger settlements will have two or three times this number.
•  Each PAD missile carries six warheads that overwhelm anti-missile defences (DM-2 to all point defence fire) and multiples the number of torpedoes in the salvo by 6.

The homebuilt missiles are not up to the safety standards required in the Imperium; although the Imperium permits nuclear munitions to be owned by world governments for planetary defence in the event of major war, there are many volumes of regulations for their safe storage and circumstances under which they can be used. Whereas most ship-to-ship missiles, even aboard warships, are non-nuclear, Dorannia has launched more nuclear munitions under combat conditions since 1103 than most planetary navies in their entire history. The fact of the matter is that
‘Atomic Dorannia’ has become trigger-happy with its new arsenal.

Since Dorannia has no capability to conduct boarding and search operations in space, the only option is to use the threat of annihilation. Vessels that seem even slightly suspect are targeted and told they have numerous missiles aimed at them. They are permitted to either sheer off and go somewhere else or otherwise proceed to land at the port very slowly and carefully.

Several vessels have been fired upon and as the guidance systems of Dorannia’s missile arsenal are not the best, accuracy is problematical. The answer is, of course, to fire large salvoes in the hope of a hit. As a result, a typical Dorannia PAD (Planetary Aerospace Defence) missile consists of a large ground-to-orbit bus section and six independently targeted short-range missiles, each with a tactical nuclear warhead. PAD silos are supplemented with smaller turrets carrying traditional missile racks (again, armed with nuclear missiles).

A number of vessels have been induced to flee in the face of this crazily aggressive response and at least one has been destroyed. It is not possible to tell from an expanding cloud of radioactive debris and gas whether the target was actually a raider or simply a merchant vessel whose bad-tempered captain chose the wrong frontier world to get stroppy with traffic control. In any case, word seems to have got round, as the raids have stopped.

JUNCTION Junction lies on the outer edge of the Spinward Marches, requiring a long transit through neutral space or a potentially hazardous journey through the Sword Worlds Confederation for Imperial traders. As a result, most ships that visit are independent or of Darrian registry. The system is important to the Darrians as a jump-off point for expeditions into Foreven, although there are few reasons to stay rather than just pass through.

Junction is home to a few thousand farmers and ranchers who have little interest in the outside universe. The ‘starport’ is nothing more than a large town with a landing area and part-time traders, plus a detachment of Darrian personnel who operate a refuelling and resupply service for Darrian vessels only. Newcomers to the world find the locals hospitable enough but unimpressed by technology or tales of interstellar adventure. Junction is listed in several interstellar navigation guides as ‘a little port that could be anywhere and does a pretty good job of being nowhere’.

# SWORD WORLDS - SPINWARDS MARCHES-SUBSECTOR J

![[BtC-SwordWorldsSubsector.jpg]]
Every system in the Sword Worlds subsector lies on the Spinward Main, although getting to some without a jump-2 capable ship requires meandering for some time. The main diverges at Iron and again at Caliburn, and heading spinward-rimward from there is a section of the main referred to as the Bowman Arm, which runs across the coreward ends of District 268 and the Five Sisters before wandering out of the sector at Garoo and Uniqua. Rimward from Caliburn, the main splits again in District 268, giving access to the rimward end of the Five Sisters in one direction and Glisten in the other.
Jump-2 ships can make a circuit back towards Trin and Mora by this route. Spinward-coreward from Iron is an

arm of the main that leads to Darrian but is not normally considered part of the Spinward Main except in purely astrographical terms, due to the political allegiance of the worlds on the Main.

The Sword Worlds Confederation, occupying a section of the Spinward Main and a couple of spurs from it, is a collection of like-minded world governments who sometimes work together, rather than a monolithic political body. The present Confederation capital is at Gram, although exactly how much power is exerted from there can vary considerably depending on the political climate.

The Sword Worlds were settled by a long-range colony mission from Terra; the Imperium arrived much later and, as a result, there are deep cultural differences between the two. Similarly, the Darrians were recovering from the _Maghiz_ when the Sword Worlders claimed the region for their own. They thus see themselves as rightful overlords of the region and tend to deal with foreign (Darrian or Imperial) ships passing through in a high-handed and arrogant manner.

The four Metal Worlds (Iron, Bronze, Mithril and Steel) are ‘reserve worlds’ held in trust by the Sword Worlds Confederation against future need. Until recently, the Confederation has vigorously resisted Imperial efforts to exploit these worlds but that attitude has recently changed. A theoretically joint project to develop Steel has been put forward although, in practice, Sword World involvement is half-hearted at best. Surveying is likely to begin soon, once the last political issues are resolved.

There are only four Imperial worlds in the subsector: Flammarion, Caladbolg, Gunn and Caliburn. Flammarion has a small Imperial Navy station and both Flammarion and Caladbolg have scout bases to serve the x-boat route through to the Five Sisters. There is also a small scout base at Biter serving the same purpose. Biter is part of the Sword Worlds Confederation and keeping the scout base in operation has, at times, required careful negotiation.

Were Steel to be developed, it might be possible to run the Imperial x-boat service through there, enabling the scout station at Biter to be closed. This appears to have been a factor in permitting the Steel Project to go ahead.

GRAM Located on the Gram Arm of the Sword Worlds section of the Spinward Main, Gram is a moderate sized world with a dense, tainted atmosphere and about 50% coverage of seas. The world is remarkable in that this 50/50 coverage is almost perfect; there is one giant ocean and one supercontinent, although there are a number of small inland seas here and there.

Gram was the first of the Sword Worlds to be settled.
The world was sufficiently habitable to allow the colonists to establish a home and then spread to what became the other Sword Worlds as their numbers grew. For this reason, the people of Gram have always considered themselves the best of the Sword Worlders and, of course, the rightful leaders of the Confederation. Gram has now held on to power in the Sword Worlds since 852, a remarkable achievement in such a turbulent political environment. Somewhat

over a century ago, the administrative apparatus of the Confederation was moved to a purpose-built city located on the far side of the planet from Gram’s own capital.

It is a heavily populated and industrialised world whose aristocracy are the owners of major industrial and commercial companies. Some are businessmen or captains of industry, others simply the heads of families that own businesses and pay staff to run them, then able to pursue other interests or a career in the military.

The popular image of the typical Sword Worlder is one of a rugged freeholder with rifles over the fireplace, working his land during the day and swapping tall tales with his neighbors over strong drinks in the evening. On Gram, this is far from the truth. Most of the population live in large cities and work either in industry or the services that support it. There are also many legal restrictions, in part made necessary by having such a large urban population; Gram’s billions are governed by a high Law Level that prohibits private ownership of firearms. This would be unthinkable to the rugged frontiersman of Sword World ideals but is a fact of life on Gram.

One of Gram’s most important industries is shipbuilding, especially for the navies of the Confederation. Sword World ships are of a lower Tech Level than those of the Imperium and not capable of far jumps. Since it is possible to reach almost any point in the Sword Worlds along the main, vessels intended for primarily defensive operations are normally only capable of jump-1, allowing them to redeploy under their own power but not surrendering space to large fuel tanks and drive systems.
Warships intended for offensive operations are built with higher jump capabilities for greater strategic mobility.

What both types have in common is a blocky and extremely tough design, with multiple-redundant systems to allow them to soak up massive punishment without being forced to withdraw. This suits Sword World commanders, among whom an unwarranted retreat is grounds for disgrace, and damage to a ship a badge of honor. Indeed, it has been said that the ideal naval engagement from the point of view of a Sword World captain is one where his ship is shot to ribbons and at least one of his peers breaks off action with a less damaged ship.

Sword World ground combat equipment is manufactured along similar lines and Gram is a major supplier to the rest of the Confederation. Combat vehicles are tough and well-armed but lacking in sensors and electronic equipment.

Despite a certain amount of pride at being the capital of the Confederation, first of the Sword Worlds, and source

of much of the Confederation’s military equipment, there is considerable disaffection among the workers of Gram.
The cities are grim and there are few opportunities for personal advancement. Some of the mid-level aristocracy have begun to champion these disaffected groups; in some cases out of genuine concern but others are doing it as a placebo, knowing that nothing will change, as they use workers as footsoldiers in their own political battles.

At present there have been few serious incidents, but crime and violence are on the rise in the poorer sections of the cities and there have been short strikes by workers.
These are normally accompanied by loud protestations by the workers of their loyalty to Gram and the Sword Worlds, and are surprisingly good-natured as well.

In one factory, for example, the workers downed tools late in the afternoon shift once a week, like clockwork.
They then marched outside where they made a statement to the press and steadfastly refused to return to work for the remainder of the day. The police sent a patrol as a token presence but there was no trouble. A representative of the management turned up to explain yet again that the issue was being addressed but concessions were not possible at the time. The strikers promised to continue their protest until their grievances were dealt with. This was accepted by both workers and owners as a necessary safety valve for disaffection both valid and unavoidable.

Not everyone is so good-natured, however. There have been all-but-revolutions in some plants, sabotage in others and attempts on the lives of members of the aristocracy. Rioting has erupted in some cities, although this is rare. It seems that unless conditions for the typical Gram citizen improve then the situation will continue to worsen – and creating a better life for billions would be hugely expensive if at all possible.

GUNN Gunn lies on a segment of the Spinward Main that has few good ports or major economies, and consequently sees little interstellar traffic. This region is sometimes termed The Slice, in a convoluted reference to the fact that proximity to the Sword Worlds inhibits trade and development in the region.

Gunn itself is primarily a mining colony, with a few dozen permanent residents and somewhat larger number of transient prospectors, miners and mineralogists.
Gunn is lacking in iron compared to most other worlds but makes up for it with other metals – notably copper, lead and tin. Various Imperial corporations and megacorporations have investigated the possibility of opening a major mining centre at Gunn but the difficulty of reliably transporting ore back to industrial worlds has proved an obstacle. Gunn remains the province of the freelance prospecting team or small mineral extraction company.

HRUNTING Hrunting lies at a junction on the coreward arm of the Sword Worlds main, which is astrographically part of the Spinward Main but generally considered to be more or less separate due to local political conditions. Its port sees considerable traffic headed out into Querion and Vilis, and the naval base supports cross-border patrols into neutral space, typically by vessels optimised for a long cruise. It has been suggested that many of these ships would be well suited to commerce raiding in Imperial space to coreward-trailing but the Sword Worlds Confederation has never commented on the subject.

Hrunting has a standard atmosphere, despite fairly low surface gravity, and possesses little surface water, largely due to ‘superflare’ activity on the part of Hrunting’s red dwarf primary. The star flares from time-to-time causing no ill effects but on a cycle of 10-
15,000 years it produces superflares. The last caused much of Hrunting’s water to evaporate and be lost to space – a higher gravity world would not have suffered such a severe loss. As a result, Hrunting’s seas are small and surrounded by extensive mineral flats that make agriculture difficult. Away from the seas, much of the surface is arid.

The majority of the population dwell in small communities close to the seas, with a few modest sized cities acting as trade hubs and transportation centres.
There is little native life on land and few imported

SLEIPNIR-CLASS PATROLLER

The Confederation has dozens of these ships in tours around the subsector at all times, their sensors sweeping for threats.
When enemies are found, the Sleipnir is a more than capable small-engagement vessel that can handle auxiliary craft and small warships – even Imperial ones.
There is little comfort inside these ships, especially when conscripted to hold marines or kommandos under the low ceiling and amidst crash-webbing and storage racks. It is not used for full-scale battles against battlecruisers or other massive foes but can hold its own against more common threats stumbled upon during patrols.

species have taken to the mineral-rich environment left behind by the evaporating oceans. The seas have a reasonable biosphere but Hrunting is a young world without many complex creatures. One exception is the group of species known as Stone Trees, which resemble trees or bushes but are in fact a mollusc-like creature with a bark-like outer shell. The Stone Trees favour a mineral-rich environment and thrive along the shores of the shrinking seas. Some can be eaten – indeed, certain species are considered delicacies – but others are toxic to humans.

JOYEUSE Named for the legendary sword of Charlemagne, which changed colour 30 times a day, Joyeuse has a standard atmosphere and 40% hydrographics. At first glance it might seem a good prospect for colonization but the numbers are deceptive. Joyeuse rotates slowly and has a year just 12 of its days long. As a result, it suffers extremes of heat and cold, with 12 days of darkness followed by 12 days of constant sunlight. Combined with a variety of fungal blights that cripple flowering plants of most species, this makes conventional agriculture difficult. In addition to producing a number of fungal foodstuffs, Joyeuse has an extensive ranching industry adapted to local conditions.

The 40 million or so inhabitants are dispersed in small to modest-sized towns, with few major population centres and therefore little in the way of economic or industrial efficiency. The largest city is Tholasborg, with a population of around 250,000. Despite this, Joyeuse manages to maintain a heavily decentralised TL10 industrial base, with the capability to build military starships and field an effective ground force.

The planetary navy of Joyeuse is based at Thoslinn, the next planet out from Joyeuse. Thoslinn is also the main naval base for the Sword Worlds Confederation as a whole, although the size of forces based there depends on internal and external politics. The base has extensive training facilities, including a collection of non-Sword Worlds vessels maintained ostensibly for familiarization purposes. It has been suggested that these vessels might also be used to train personnel to hijack or attack them, or even act as a Trojan horse in covert intelligence-gathering operations.

MITHRIL Mithril is one of the four Metal Worlds claimed by the Sword Worlds Confederation but not yet developed or colonized. The world is very suitable in most ways for

colonization - it has a standard atmosphere and about 80% ocean coverage. However, Mithril is more than a little cold.

Much of Mithril’s ocean surface is either frozen or prone to drifting ice and the land is swept by harsh winds and often blanketed by ice and snow. While this would not pose too much of a problem to high-technology settlers, it makes agriculture problematic and raises the cost of creating a viable colony.

Mithril lies on the Spinward Main and while vessels capable of jump-2 or more tend to bypass the system, some ships must come through. Those that can skim fuel from a gas giant and move on without visiting the world. A patrol vessel from the Confederation is sometimes stationed in the system and may challenge vessels passing through but, on the whole, Sword Worlders will not interfere with the navigational rights of passing vessels.

Vessels not equipped for fuel skimming must obtain their fuel from the planet, usually by landing in a remote area and running hoses to a source of water or landing in water and simply drawing it into the tanks. The Confederation does not appreciate this practice but has never done anything about it; ships landing on the world to refuel are technically violating Sword World sovereign territory but so long as Imperial vessels just refuel and leave, the Sword Worlders are not sufficiently outraged to confront the Imperium.

Relatively few ships land at the Class E port, which is little more than a marked landing area with beacons and a cluster of huts nearby. Outsiders are not welcome at the port. Fuel and resupply are not available for passing vessels, although Sword World vessels on official business are a different matter and Sword Worlds-
registered merchant ships might be more warmly received.

Although the population of Mithril is officially rated as zero as there is no permanent population, a handful of Sword Worlders operate the tiny port. This is one of the loneliest jobs in Charted Space - to be stationed with just a couple of companions on a planet several weeks from assistance if disaster strikes.

This tiny presence serves to support the Confederation’s claim to ownership of the world, necessary for political reasons but not a pleasant posting. Few of the personnel deployed to Mithril Starport have ever ventured into the arctic wilderness surrounding the base as there is no

prospect for rescue if something goes wrong and they all have jobs to do at the port.

Exploration teams have surveyed the world, sometimes working out of the port, often reporting an unusual phenomenon known as the ephemeral glade. Mithril is normally very cold and its ecosystem has developed to take maximum advantage of short periods of above-zero temperatures. During these very brief warm periods (warm by Mithril’s standards means a degree or so above freezing), an ephemeral glade may spring up, an area of plant life that grows from the thawing soil at incredible speed. Within a few hours, an area of grass-like plants up to 2-3 metres high can spring up.

Glades tend to be 2-3 kilometres across and rapidly attract animals from the surrounding area, drawn to the readily available food and shelter of the glade.
Once the temperature drops below freezing, the plants die rapidly and the animals depart after a last frenzy of feeding on the dying glade’s bounty.

Among the animals attracted to a glade are Calamanders, scaly burrowing creatures with a complex society. Each group is centered on a female who bears young and seems to be the ‘queen’ of the group. She resides in a burrow that she rarely leaves, attended by several drone males. A third gender, referred to as a protector, digs tunnels, forages for food and, as the name suggests, fiercely protects the burrow. They are amphibious and prone to scavenge for food or shiny objects that they take back to the female, perhaps as gifts or trophies.

Crystallice are another creature native to Mithril and are, at best, a nuisance. They are tiny insect-like creatures that, even close up, resemble ice crystals.
They lie on the surface of snow or ice and attach themselves to passing creatures, chewing through clothing to reach exposed skin. At this point, they begin to burrow into the dermis, causing extreme pain and often considerable bleeding. Crystallice infestation can be fatal and best countered by picking the crystallice off before they burrow under the skin.

With most of its worlds on the Spinward Main and in close proximity to Mora, the Lunion subsector was settled early in the Imperial expansion into the Marches and contains a number of high-technology worlds.
Most traffic bound for the Five Sisters and Darrian goes through Lunion, contributing to the local economy.

Ling Standard Products (LSP) has major shipyards at Lunion and Strouden, the most important yards in the Marches in terms of output. They handle commercial and military contracts on a large scale, as well as building standard designs and one-off vessels for private customers. Standards of workmanship are very high. Not coincidentally, the main naval bases for the subsector are also at Lunion and Strouden, with light patrol forces based out of Shirene and Capon. Subsector assets

belong to the 43rd Fleet, which is mainly concerned with keeping its section of the Spinward Main safe for navigation. Long-term guardship deployments are not uncommon, even in systems with minor starports. While tedious for the crews involved, such deployments go a long way towards deterring both piracy and smuggling.

The sparse area in the coreward end of the subsector is part of the Abyss Rift and has the same bad reputation for misjumping ships and other strange phenomena.

The subsector’s planetoid belts are something of an economic disappointment. Gandr is particularly poor, although the discovery of superheavy elements there in 1040 caused a number of firms to move in, only to pull out again when the deposits proved unviable. Zaibon

once had the largest deposit of copper on record but this has been played out and few new deposits are being found. As a result, the system’s mining-based economy is in decline.

Ianic has a sizable minority of Jonkeereen (about 30%)
among its population, humans genetically engineered to thrive in desert environments. They generally live apart from the world’s other humans but get along well enough with them.

Less harmonious is Quiru, where a recent coup using mercenary forces toppled the government and put a military junta in its place. As yet there has been no official Imperial response.

GANDR Gandr was almost a boom town system as a result of the discovery of large deposits of superheavy elements in an asteroid cluster deep in the system’s main belt. This sparked heavy investment and a rush of prospectors but the find was not repeated. The concentration found at Gandr has never been explained and while many mining firms tried to make a go of it, the belt proved too sparse in other minerals to be worth exploiting. One-by-one the firms packed up, leaving behind a ramshackle mess of infrastructure that expanded too fast then was stripped for what could be quickly sold off. Today, Gandr is a byword for disappointment and economic unviability, although there are still some small-scale operations managing to turn a small profit.

IANIC Ianic is on the Spinward Main, though it is not a world of any great importance, just somewhere vessels pass through on voyages. The world is a small dustball almost entirely devoid of surface water but it has a standard atmosphere.

Like most desert worlds, Ianic is not an endless sea of dunes; in between are mountains, rocky badlands and areas of semi-desert where there is just enough water to support life. There are even a couple of very small seas, which would be lakes on any other world. Oases are not uncommon where underground water reserves well up close to the surface.

Overall, much of Ianic is not habitable without starship-
grade recycling and imports of fresh water and food.
However, the world supports a population numbering in the millions. There are a few large groupings but most of the population are spread out across the surface in small towns supported by deep wells or the few natural watercourses. Government is officially by a bureaucratic system descended from the original colonial

administration, yet in practice the world government controls only the region around the capital and what passes for a starport, not much more than a few low concrete bunkers beside a flattened landing area.

Fuel is not available at the port, as such, but water can be obtained from the saltwater lake nearby and processed to make liquid hydrogen. A hefty Cr250 landing fee is levied at the port, payable whether or not ships take on water, as the locals view water as one of their world’s most precious resources and tax all visitors to offset the loss.

About 30% of the population are Jonkeereen, living separately to the mainstream humans for the most part. Jonkeereen were originally adapted from humans to colonize the world of Jonkeer in Deneb and have spread to many other worlds, to be encountered across the Imperium. Those Jonkeereen whose home regions lie close to the capital are governed from there.
The remainder, like many of the mainstream human settlements, are too far away for effective governance and go their own way.

There is little friction between Jonkeereen groups and other humans, although there is little integration either.
Both have different ways of doing things and a tendency to ignore one another. Ianic is big enough for everyone, even if most of its land is uninhabitable.

Observers have occasionally expressed puzzlement that Ianic, a mid-tech world with a Class E starport, has its own spur of the x-boat network. Although there is officially no scout base present in the system, Ianic is used for two important and related purposes by the IISS.
The Ianic system is used as a storage point for x-boats and supporting tenders not in current service, plus a number of couriers with various capabilities. There are several reasons for this; one is simply to have extra boats and tenders ready to feed into the network when needed but, more importantly, there are a number of emergency/
urgent message protocols in place. A single courier, most likely from the naval base at Adabicci or Lunion itself, arriving in the Ianic system can trigger what some scouts refer to as the Ianic Panic, sending x-boats and fast couriers off in all directions with the message aboard. This is normally used for great emergencies, such as the outbreak of the Fourth Frontier War.

This large collection of communications and support ships is not based on Ianic itself but orbits one of the system’s gas giants, with a central station coordinating all approaches and departures as well as acting as an accommodation centre. The scouts have little to do with Ianic proper, although sometimes personnel conduct desert-survival training on the surface.

Creating Jonkeereen Travellers Physically, Jonkeereen are not very different to baseline humans. They were adapted about 400 years ago and have bred true ever since. Tall, lean and dark-skinned, they resemble naturally evolved desert dwellers. Their perspiration system is extremely efficient and they have membranes to protect their eyes from wind-borne sand or dust.

Jonkeereen society varies somewhat across the many worlds where they dwell, however the basic traits are conservatism and cooperation. Their ways are austere and pragmatic in the extreme and this concern with survival can make them seem harsh or even heartless, especially towards outsiders. They are more likely to help others of their own kind than outsiders, if only because fellow Jonkeereen are less likely to get everyone killed by doing something stupid.

Characteristics Jonkeereen Travellers have the following modifiers applied to their characteristics: END+1, EDU-1

Traits Jonkeereen Travellers all possess the following traits:
Heat Resistant (-2): Jonkeereen have extremely efficient perspiration systems. They suffer two points less damage from extremes of temperature in their environment.

Careers All careers from the Traveller Core Rulebook are all suitable for Jonkeereen.

SPIRELLE A prosperous mid-tech world located on the Spinward Main, Spirelle is well designated as a rich system. There is plenty of water, a standard atmosphere and an environment hospitable to humans. The population expanded steadily after the world was initially colonized and now there are several hundred million people on Spirelle.

The populace is spread across the globe, mostly around coastal regions. Sea and river transport is the main way to move goods and people between the cities; although road and air links are well serviced, water transportation is cheap, which makes it attractive for non-urgent goods.

Spirelle exports large quantities of TL8 goods to nearby worlds and much of the world’s industry is geared to the export market, producing rugged items that are easy to maintain with limited facilities. Produce aimed at the local market tends to be more complex and sophisticated.

There is a good starport, with government-licensed traders handling most negotiations for private cargoes.
The starport is, not surprisingly, co-located with the world’s largest seaport, with huge container ships delivering cargoes from all around Spirelle for export.
These are often shipped in standard (interstellar)
shipping containers, which can be handled by normal starship-loading equipment and carried aboard freight vessels with no need to unload or repackage.

Another important export is bulk seafood and related products. Extensive fishing fleets and sea-farming techniques produce a great deal of food. Some goes into the local diet but a sizable amount is processed and shipped out for export. Live fish and seafood are also exported, although this requires careful handling and makes the produce expensive to the end purchaser.

With so much of the population living along coasts or on islands, inland areas tend to be sparsely populated.
Spirelle has been settled for centuries, so there are few areas truly uncharted and most localities have a few scattered villages. However, there is wilderness throughout the continents, with mountains, rain forests and tundra covering much of the interior, making it useless to the world’s inhabitants.

The Scout Service has a base on Spirelle, mainly existing as a training establishment and making use of the extensive wilderness to conduct survival training as well as navigational and problem-solving exercises.
There are also areas leased as large-scale free-fire zones, used to train weapons skills.

Although the Scout Service is not one of the Imperial armed forces, scouts often have to defend themselves and most personnel can handle weapons with at least a basic level of proficiency. The training areas are used for basic and refresher courses for a broad cross-
section of personnel and the scene of much more advanced training.

The Scout Service also maintains a security arm to protect its bases and personnel. Normally, these teams simply act as guards, however some are trained in hostage-rescue and object retrieval. The latter is a catch-all term used from getting a valuable alien artefact back from thieves to storming a hijacked Scout Service vessel.

Within the leased areas are mock-ups of various Scout Service vessels and other common starships, most with internal gravity equipment so they can be stormed in a range of conditions from zero-gravity to a
‘shirtsleeves’ environment.

The scout base is located in a remote area, with mountains restricting access from some directions. It has its own port, which is not available for non-official vessels to use. There is a sizable community at the base and a small presence is also maintained at the main Spirelle starport for liaison and recruiting.

Spirelle is, to a great extent, the sort of world the Imperium was formed to support and protect. It is home to large numbers of people who contribute to the Imperial economy as both producers and importers of goods, and may eventually develop into a major world.
In the meantime, Spirelle lacks the high-technology industrial base to construct an effective system defence fleet. While a few imported system defence boats can make a huge difference, a world of this kind cannot truly protect itself from large-scale interstellar threats and must rely on the Imperial Navy.

WARDN Wardn is, in many ways, a typical frontier world of the Imperium. Its atmosphere is a little thin, but entirely breathable, and with plenty of water the world could be a major agricultural centre. However, its location on

the fringe of Imperial space has resulted in a lack of investment and immigration, resulting in a population that has remained stable at around 50,000 for many decades. Most live in a single city adjacent to the downport, with a ring of outlying settlements tailing off into wilderness.

Wardn is famous for its Patterned Desert, to the point where many offworlders assume the planet is a vast arid wasteland, but this is far from the truth. Most areas are well-watered and home to a variety of wildlife, with extensive forests and grasslands. The Patterned Desert itself is the subject of great speculation, with some believing its intricate patterns have intentional design and were created by an intelligent species. Others are adamant that the patterns are nothing more than traces left behind by primitive anaerobic life.

The scout base at Wardn maintains a study detachment at the Patterned Desert, which hosts a regular rotation of scientists from various universities and institutes.
Other expeditions have been set up on Wardn and scouts occasionally have to rescue amateur scientists who have no idea how hazardous a desert can be.
The scout base also launches frequent missions into District 268 and is widely supposed to be engaged in covert surveillance of the Sword Worlds Confederation.
The Imperial authorities issue only vaguely worded statements about monitoring merchant traffic crossing the border and gathering data on shipping using the local ports, which could mean almost anything.

# MORA - SPINWARDS MARCHES-SUBSECTOR L

![[BtC-MoraSubsector.jpg]]
Very much the gateway to the Marches, Mora was the first area to be colonized by the Imperium and has developed steadily ever since. All worlds in the subsector are Imperial members and defended by the 73rd Fleet, which is based out of Mora itself. The Spinward Marches Sector Fleet is also headquartered at Mora, although if a Depot system is someday designated it may move there.

In the meantime, the co-location of fleet headquarters and de facto sector ducal court has been criticized for creating an over-politicised fleet. Other observers suggest it enables better co-operation between the political structure of the Imperium and the Navy, its

main military arm. Either way, the Marches is behind the times in retaining a ‘crust’ defensive strategy when the move to elastic defence began elsewhere a decade ago.

The Imperial Navy has additional bases at Mercury, Moran and Hexos, which mostly play host to lighter fleet elements. Mora is more intensively patrolled than most other subsectors and has no less than four light carrier task groups available for anti-piracy and general security. This makes Mora safer for traffic, at the cost of taking fleet assets away from frontier areas that might need them more.

MORA SUBSECTOR

### Spinward Marches

### L

Palique For most of the year, Palique is no more hazardous to visit than any other world, however during its passage through the planetoid belt the approach can be more tricky. There is relatively little danger to ships from asteroids – Palique itself is endangered mainly due to gravitational attraction and even so tends to encounter only small rocks on most passages.

A safe passage to or from Palique requires jump entry or emergence outside the planetoid field, typically about four times the usual 100 diameter aiming point. A course avoiding major hazards can be plotted on an Easy (4+) Astrogation check, although this does not guarantee a ship will not encounter smaller chunks of rock. Each pass through the belt causes Palique to perturb nearby asteroids, making it impossible to chart them all.

A ship that follows a well plotted course in a cautious manner – taking about 36 hours for the transit in and out from close orbit – can do so in almost complete safety. Minor course corrections may be necessitated but a good sensor watch will suffice to spot hazards early enough that any competent pilot can automatically avoid the danger. However, this is very slow.

The transit time can be reduced to 30 hours without running major risks, although higher speeds reduce the time available for evasive action. Note that maneuver drive power does not affect this transit time – it is defined by conditions, not the ability to accelerate. A Routine
(6+) Pilot check is needed to make a safe transit.
For every 10% increment shaved off this time, either by jumping in or out a little closer or being more liberal with the throttle, the check is subject to a cumulative DM-2.

If the Effect of this check is negative, the ship hits something, suffering 1D damage per point of negative Effect. Minor damage indicates clipping a chunk of rock; a large amount will mean the ship has slammed into a large asteroid with serious consequences.

Mora itself is an economic and industrial powerhouse and has large megacorporate holdings on-planet. Among the lesser corporations also headquartered there is Al Morai, a moderately sized shipping line that provides a reliable service through to the Darrian Confederation via Vilis.

There are six worlds in the subsector (Heroni, Catuz, Jokotre, Palique, Fenl's Gren, and Duale) that are Amber Zoned and there are no Red Zones. However, access to what is left of the Imperial Research Station on Duale is not possible. Details of what the station was working on are unavailable but in 1102 a massive explosion caused heavy damage to the station and caused its temporary abandonment. Naval assets and Imperial Marines remain on station (at a curiously respectful distance) to prevent intruders from entering the site.

Palique’s Amber Zone is due to frequent meteor bombardment. The world is a captured body following a highly eccentric orbit, which takes it through one of the system’s two planetoid belts twice a year. Although conveniently placed as an industrial centre for minerals mined from the rich belts, Palique can be a hazardous destination for starships. All of the world’s cities are deep underground for protection and the world is justly famous for the quality of vacc suits and vacuum-
environment survival gear manufactured there.

Pimane is an interesting astrophysical oddity. Its surface has a number of extremely deep rift valleys that contain an atmosphere dense enough to support life, although the surface is a near-vacuum.

CAREY A small, wet world, Carey’s ecosystem is dominated by a vast array of fungal species. Some are very large, growing into weird shapes and play a similar role to trees in other ecosystems. Native life is not particularly sophisticated, although there are some species of large flying insects and centipede-like creatures living among the larger fungi. Offworld species, including humans, find the spore-laden atmosphere of Cary intolerable and anyone venturing outside the carefully sealed downport buildings must undergo thorough decontamination upon their return. The risk of contaminating other worlds with Carey’s rampant fungal growth is such that the Scout Service is considering imposing travel restrictions or even a full interdiction.

MORA Mora is, both historically and astrographically, the Gateway to the Marches. It is now one of the richest worlds for many parsecs and extremely important to local politics, despite the fact that technically Duchess Delphine of Mora wields no more power and has no more responsibilities than any other subsector Duke in the Marches.

Mora is a large world with a dense, tainted atmosphere, almost entirely covered in oceans with only a few large islands and smaller archipelagos breaking the surface.
Nevertheless, Mora was the first world of the Marches to be settled by the Imperium and received far more investment than other colonies; starting in 60, Mora was developed as a trading centre financed by Ling Standard Products. This required a good starport, which led to the creation of yards to overhaul trade and exploration vessels. Soon afterward, full-scale shipbuilding began.

As early explorers pushed into the sector, Mora was the interface point where goods were marshalled for shipping back into the Imperium and settlement missions made preparations for the final leg of their journeys. It was through Mora that goods from the Sword Worlds, the Darrian Confederation and even the Zhodani Consulate came.

Eventually, Trin became important as a secondary route into the Marches but for many decades everything and everyone came through Mora. Some colonists never went any further, choosing to settle on Mora rather than advance into unexplored territory. The world’s population grew rapidly and, with it, the amount of industry it could support.

Today, Mora has a population numbering tens of billions, dwelling in gigantic mega-cities that cover much of the available land mass as well as surrounding seabed. The upper regions of these cities project high above the surface of the seas, each crested with a spaceport. Most cities lie on or close to the equator and have spread so much that they run into one another, creating a single city circling the entire equator. Smaller cities are separated from the main belt by oceanic trenches.

Most of the little dry land that remains is given over to high-technology intensive agriculture, with additional food production provided by seabed farming. There are, however, a few exceptions. One is Mora’s massive downport, which takes up most of an equatorial island.
Another is the World Park, a large nature reserve, and there is also an island reserved as a private estate for the high officials of the world government.

Mora’s system of government is unusual, in that Duchess Delphine is not just the world’s official representative but also the head of Mora’s government.
In practice, the duchess delegates her role of representative to the Imperium to a deputy, except when she feels personal intervention is necessary. All senior governmental positions are held by women and Mora is legally a matriarchy. Males are not enslaved on Mora, merely not permitted to hold high office.

Mora has no police force or other civilian emergency services, as all such tasks are undertaken by the armed forces. One particularly important branch is concerned with orbital traffic control and vessel tracking; local space is very crowded and keeping traffic flowing is a full-time job for a great many people. There is so much traffic around Mora Imperial Highport that a secondary highport has been constructed for use by those with permission, including vessels of the Imperial Navy and sector administration, but primarily megacorporate starships belonging to Delgado, Tukera and Imperiallines, who jointly funded the venture.
These vessels receive heavily discounted services and a streamlined customs system. The port is secured by mercenary troops and patrol craft supplied by Instellarms, which has a large commercial presence there. The volume of traffic is still so high that there is talk of building a third port to serve government and sector administration vessels.

The world is highly industrialised, with a very high Tech Level. This makes it one of the most important economic players not just in the Marches but also in Deneb, where a significant proportion of Mora’s goods are sold.

High-technology industry is supported by the Mora Technical Institute, which performs cutting-edge research into gravitics, electronics and manufacturing, as well as training graduates. MTI is somewhat overshadowed by the Imperial Mora University, which deals more in history, political studies and similar fields, and the social status associated with being a graduate of IMU is higher than MTI. It is said, not without reason, that technical institute graduates can expect a good, well-paid career working in firms owned by the families of IMU attendees.

The remainder of the Mora system is heavily exploited.
There are mining outposts throughout the planetoid belt and the moons of both gas giants are also heavily mined, with scientific installations scattered here and there. The belt is also the site of major biotechnology industries, conducting both research and production.

The system’s scout and naval bases, located on large planetoids in the belt, are both huge. The scout base is the IISS regional headquarters for the Spinward Marches and marshals a huge communications fleet in addition to a flotilla of scout/couriers, express boat tenders and survey vessels for tasks across the sector. The naval base is headquarters for the sector and subsector fleets, although the sector admiral resides on Mora and commands from there. The Mora system is home to several heavy battle and cruiser squadrons of the Sector Fleet and the naval base has more capital ships in reserve.

If another frontier war erupts, it is from Mora that the fleet will sally out to defend the Marches and from here the war will be directed. If the worst comes to pass, it might be that Mora becomes the last bastion of the Imperium in the Marches; certainly, it would be held with great determination. Were Mora to be lost, the Marches would either have already fallen or defeat would be inevitable. Unsurprisingly, Mora’s system defence squadron is one of the most powerful in the Imperium.

NEXINE Nexine is a large world, almost entirely covered by oceans. The atmosphere is of a standard composition and density but its taint makes the use of a filter mask necessary. The world is part of the Palique Cluster, on both the coreward x-boat route form Mora and also the jump-2 route into Trin’s Veil and ultimately Glisten.

Several attempts have been made to settle Nexine at various times, usually without success. A small population, numbering in the tens of thousands, dwells in far-flung communities, all of them small, on islands across the globe. The island-towns are broadly self-
sufficient, each with its own agricultural base, light industries and fisheries to maintain equipment in local use and feed the people. The overall TL8 rests on industry at the cottage level and is insufficient to export significant goods.

There are a few larger settlements, notably the capital which is co-located with the starport and scout base.
Even here, the population is not large enough to support heavy industry and it is the scout base that is the mainstay of Nexine’s economy. The Scout Service contracts with local businesses for everything from food supplies to cleaning services, as does the starport.
However, the scout base is small, consisting of a fenced-
off corner of the starport leased by the Scout Service.

A handful of cutters and shuttles serve the tenders that support x-boats passing through the system and there is an extensive communications suite. In all, there are no more than 200 Scout Service personnel in the system at any one time.

Trade ships come through Nexine but the world’s tiny economy cannot support buying and selling, nor produce enough of anything to be worth freighting, so the port makes only a little money from berthing fees, rations and the like. Crews spend a significant amount of money in the capital’s bars, restaurants and shops.

This dependence on the port for income has crippled growth of Nexine’s own economy. A disproportionate percentage of the world’s population is employed in service industries around the port, leaving too few to develop other sectors. Were this source of income to dry up, Nexine’s economy would almost certainly crash, a situation is all too common on worlds with a low population. What Nexine needs more than anything else is more people. There have been attempts to attract immigrants using schemes ranging from generous land grants to refugee-relocation projects but nothing has worked. The current idea is to see if genetically engineered humans could be seeded on Nexine, making use of the oceans that make up 99% of the world’s surface.

As yet, the project consists of little more than a few scientific teams, researching a wide range of important factors, from mineral content in the oceans to current conditions, with extensive seabed mapping also underway to locate suitable regions for an aquatic or semi-aquatic population to be settled in.

Some Imperial scientists working in Nexine’s oceans are Dolphins, uplifted to sentience long ago and now a species apart from their lesser cousins. Their unique insight into the aquatic conditions of Nexine will likely prove invaluable to the project.

There are several scientific outposts in various corners of the world and information-gathering drones have been dropped into the seas in great numbers. The main scientific base is a large installation with a crew of about 100 technicians, scientists and support workers, from which research submarines of various sizes depart on their cruises. Deep-diving subs have also been deployed to Nexine and have begun penetrating the deep ocean trenches and exploring the abyssal plains. This represents a significant investment in money as well as effort, so presumably there is a real chance that the project will go ahead at some point in the future.

SYSTEMS PRODUCTS

THE SPECIALIST COLLECTION

2

_Palique is renowned for the high quality of its vacc suits and environmental protection equipment. All are manufactured at TL14 and have a reputation for reliability and comfort that extends far beyond the sector. Of course, this is reflected in the price tag._

PALIQUE TAILORED VACC SUIT A standard lightweight suit worn as crew uniform by some personnel, the tailored vacc suit is little more cumbersome than a set of heavy duty clothes. Armor and radiation protection is not as good as a bulkier suit but the main garment can be worn constantly without fatigue.
Suits come with a set of undergloves’ and a soft bubble headcovering that are adequate, although most users purchase the accessory kit and use it when they need real protection.

The suit contains a highly oxygenated gel trapped between layers of cloth around the collar area, which is combined with carbon dioxide scrubbing materials. This creates an integral air supply/rebreather system that can sustain a wearer for an hour under normal exertion without discomfort and about five times as long in gradually increasing distress. All Palique suits use this system, giving the wearer a last chance to reach safety if other systems fail or the opportunity to operate without a life support pack. The collar system is activated by pulling a tab and must be replaced after use. This is a fiddly but not complex process, although most users prefer to avoid it by using accessories.

A tailored vacc suit can be used by anyone who has had the most cursory instruction

- it is little more than a set of clothes with glove seals and a bubble helmet. It is not

recommended that unskilled personnel do anything more complex than sit at their consoles while wearing a vacc suit, however.

PALIQUE ACCESSORY PACK The accessory pack contains a solid helmet and semi-rigid torso piece, which drops over the suit and provides additional armor protection, although this is intended to protect against micrometeorites. There is also a belt that can be worn with or without the torso piece. Its pockets contain over-gloves and safety tethers, a battery-powered lamp and a one-hour air bottle plus two emergency disposable gas thruster units that allow a stranded spacefarer to return to their ship. The suit can be fed with power and air from an external source – a feed is normally found at all starship crew duty stations

- or run off the belt batteries and air bottle. For extended operations, the

manufacturer recommends the use of the torso unit, which contains an eight-
hour air supply and sufficient oxygenated/rebreather gel to keep the wearer alive for twice that long after the air runs out.

DESCRIPTION

The Deep Ranger-class is an extremely well-
equipped vessel intended for long duration deep-
diving in water or other non-corrosive fluids. Its underwater displacement is around 1500 tons; not large for a maritime vessel but sizeable for a civilian submarine (note that water displacement is not the same as starship displacement, which is determined by displacement of liquid hydrogen rather than water).

This submarine can safely descend to depths of 16km, far more than needed on most worlds, and can stay underwater for as long as food stocks last. It is extremely cramped, however, as almost all available space is taken up with equipment or controls The submarine has a nominal crew complement of 10, although most vessels operate with 3-5 personnel on board.
This makes it possible to remove some of the bunks and reconfigure spaces to give the crew a little breathing room.

By far the most spacious part of the submarine is its laboratory suite, which consists of a main hydrographics lab and four configurable research spaces. Most external work is done with a mix

of heavy and fine-work manipulator arms or sensors mounted on extendable masts pushed into seabed silt. There are airlocks for divers but these can only be used in shallow water unless robotic craft are launched. The research suite also contains holding tanks, of which nearly half can be refrigerated and a cryoberth unit normally used to freeze samples.

The vessel’s fusion power plant allows extremely long duration operations and is complemented by a water-jet system linked to hydrographic sampling equipment. High powered water jet thrusters allow rapid emergency movement away from a hazard or station-keeping in strong currents, and there is an auxiliary crawler system on the ventral surfaced of the submersible to permit movement on the seabed.

Although all submarines come equipped with life support and hostile environment capability, the Deep Ranger takes this to an extreme and has a multiply redundant backup system. In dire emergenies, the main control cabin can be sealed and ejected, returning to the surface by means of slight positive buoyancy.

# FIVE SISTERS - SPINWARDS MARCHES-SUBSECTOR M

The Five Sisters were first explored by the merchant captain Ignaz Ruffleran, who named the worlds of Mirriam, Jone, Penelope, Karin and Ucella after his daughters. When an official subsector designation was assigned, these worlds gave what had previously been District 267 its name.

Lying beyond the Imperium proper and connected to it only by a tenuous link through the Sword Worlds, the subsector was not heavily colonized at first. A coordinated effort was implemented in 740 under the auspices of Emperor Paulo I but was curtailed half a century later after little success. That efforts to colonize a region close to two worlds inhabited by the psionics-using Droyne coincided with the Psionics Suppressions has not escaped notice.

Since that time, the subsector has remained an isolated territory under the administration of the Imperial Navy. It is the responsibility of the 208th Fleet, which is

### Fleet Organization

_In keeping with the general doctrine that ‘sector fleets fight wars; subsector fleets keep the peace’, most subsector fleets do not have capital ships assigned to them on a permanent basis. Heavy assets are normally concentrated at the sector command level, with subsector fleets assigned battleships only if an urgent need arises. The 208th Fleet, however, has a BatRon (battleship squadron) assigned on a more or less permanent basis. It could, in theory, be recalled to sector command to create a unified fleet in wartime._

Both the 208th Fleet and elements of the Spinward Marches Fleet assigned to the region have their headquarters at Iderati naval base. The smaller bases at Raweh, Wonstar, Karin, Mirriam, Jone and Emape support patrol and interdiction assets, as well as blocking the approaches to Andor and Candory with heavy system-defence squadrons.

Sector fleet assets are mainly concerned with flag-showing operations out to spinward and rimward, as well as sweeps into District 268 and Darrian space. The latter missions are normally conducted by escort destroyers and smaller craft, with the three light cruiser task groups taking responsibility for the occasional mission trailing-corewards along the Sword Worlds border and operations outside Imperial space. Task groups can be encountered quite far out in Foreven from time-to-time, but are generally kept within a few weeks’ transit of the border.

The Andor Blockade Squadron is based at Raweh. At any given time most, but not all, of its assets are deployed in Andor; the remainder will be in port conducting training and maintenance.
The system is never left uncovered and either the Interdiction Tender or at least two destroyers will be present. The same deployment exists with the Candory Interdiction Squadron, based at Karin.

Also based at Karin is the Heavy Support Squadron, which can reach Andor or Candory in a single jump. The subsector admiral has a flag squadron, although it is rather light; it is able to move around the subsector dealing with whatever problems arise. A pair of battleships is permanently assigned to the Heavy Support Squadron but the ships themselves are often rotated out and replaced with others. Current practice is to use second-class battleships for this role but upon occasion even brand-
new dreadnoughts have been sighted over Andor and Candory.

The 208th Fleet patrols the subsector and protects Imperial interests there, and for this purpose has a force composed mostly of light vessels. It also conducts missions out into Foreven and the Trojan Reach, and maintains the so-called ‘ring of steel’
around the interdicted worlds of Andor and Candory. These Droyne worlds are Red Zoned with an unusually heavy naval force to maintain the interdiction. Capital ships are sometimes deployed as part of these interdiction squadrons; another very unusual move on the part of the Imperial navy.

unusual in having capital ships permanently assigned to it, more likely to do with the interdiction of Andor and Candory than protection of the few Imperial assets in the region, although why battleships are needed to enforce a Red Zone remains a mystery. Droyne ships are not normally stopped – the Red Zone seems to be there to keep people out of Andor and Candory, not keep the Droyne in.

The 208th Fleet has its headquarters at Iderati, the subsector capital, plus six other bases in a ring around Andor and Candory. These are home to patrol ships and vessels that enforce the interdiction within the Red Zone systems and also heavier non-jump capable defence squadrons. These are deployed widely and may be in place to catch vessels trying to slip through to Droyne worlds. The fact that the base systems are Amber Zoned helps to deter visitors, however it seems to have more to do with the danger of intruding into a heavily defended system than anything else.

Andor and Candory, as already noted, are both Red Zones and Droyne worlds. As well as the base systems surrounding the interdicted area, there are three other Amber Zones in place at Jinx, Lakou and 875-496. Of these, only Lakou is an Imperial member. It seems likely that the Imperial Research Station at Froin (designated Research Station Zeta) is involved with research connected to the Droyne but, as usual, the authorities refuse to comment.

There are 10 non-Imperial worlds in the subsector, not counting those of the Droyne. Most are located to rimward of the Imperial zone, in the direction of what some Imperials call the Outrim Void, despite it being

only rimward of the Marches and hardly a void. The term was first coined in an entertainment show and seems to have stuck. In any case, travel ‘outrim’ into Menorial via Five Sisters is discouraged by the authorities. Despite this, exploratory trade missions occasionally crawl along the Spinward Main all the way to Five Sisters and then head out into the relative unknown in search of new markets and a hoped-for big score.

FROIN Froin is an essentially insignificant world, except that it is the site of Imperial Research Station Zeta.
The permanent population of the planet is housed almost exclusively in a small town surrounding the starport, which sees a little through traffic headed out to spinward-coreward. Most residents work in support industries for the port, which also employs a couple of hundred non-resident personnel at any given time. The research installation is located 100 or so kilometres away; a short hop by shuttle or starship but enough to prevent casual intrusions. A ship approaching the station would be sufficiently off course that its crew could not claim an honest mistake and, since the area around the research station is restricted to authorized vessels only, such an intruder would risk being fired upon by the installation’s defences. This has happened from time-to-time, although there are no records of anything but warning shots.

Exactly what goes on at the research station is not common knowledge but it is guarded by a detachment of Imperial Marines and ringed with missile launchers dug into the bedrock. Navy ships routinely call there; usually auxiliaries but occasionally a heavily escorted transport.

Given the proximity to the interdicted worlds of Andor and Candory, it seems likely that Research Station Zeta is engaged in psionic studies or perhaps work towards a better understanding of the Droyne.

MIRRIAM Mirriam is a large world with a dense, tainted atmosphere with more than 90% of the surface covered by oceans. A considerable amount of Mirriam’s land takes the form of mountain ranges, small islands or is otherwise unusable. This includes most of the arctic and sub-arctic regions.

As a result, the population, numbering hundreds of millions, mostly dwells in cities located just off the coast and projecting up above the waves. Of those built on land, some are located in mountain valleys but most lie on coastal plains where they benefit from sea-farming.
This is an important industry, ranging from fisheries to vast seabed farms protected by domes, growing fields of cereals and vegetables for the cities and shipment through the starport. Mirriam is a commercial exporter of foodstuffs to surrounding worlds but this is of minor importance to the local economy. Most food shipped out goes to the naval bases in the surrounding area. Imperial-navy ration contracts pay better than commercial sales, so much of the world’s output is tied into fulfilling these requirements.

Most of Mirriam’s income is derived from exports of industrial and technological items. Only two worlds in the subsector (Iderati and Karin) have better technology available for export and Mirriam’s population is big enough to allow for large-scale industrial production of TL10 items. Grav vehicles and electronics for various applications are exported across the subsector.

Miriam is a dictatorship, although a moderate and benign one. Laws are not excessively tight and enforcement is fair for the most part. Living standards are good and there are opportunities for personal advancement, all of which contributes to a contented population and popular government.

One route to advancement is Imperial service. Mirriam has both a naval base and way station, both of which recruit extensively from the world’s population, offering a generous system of tax breaks and enhanced second-
career opportunities for veterans. Many enter service with Mirriam’s system squadron or reserve armed forces,
while ex-scouts find a new home with the Deep Sea Exploration Service (DSES).

The DSES is dedicated to mapping ocean beds and researching the creatures living there. It is a reasonably safe occupation but there are always hazards inherent when exploring caves in the side of an ocean trench 10 kilometres beneath the surface.

Mirriam’s naval base is one of several forming a ring around the Droyne worlds of Andor and Candory. Due to the extremely strict nature of the Red Zones around those worlds, the nearest Imperial systems all have naval bases and forces there are on high alert. Caution is advised, as the Imperial Navy is more than ready to fire on vessels attempting to slip through or sneak something past the blockade.

As a result, extremely thorough inspections and customs checks are undertaken and any irregularity can result in a ship being impounded and stripped down to the hull braces, while the crew get pretty much the same treatment. Vessels capable of making the three-parsec transit are viewed with more suspicion than those that obviously could not reach Candory.

Mirriam’s scout base is a full way station, serving as a repository for communications vessels plying the long route back into the Imperium as well as between Imperial base worlds in the subsector. A sizable fleet of survey and exploration vessels is also stationed at Mirriam and scout ships routinely depart on missions to spinward and rimward. Most are of short duration but some can be deployed for very long periods. The Scout Service has recently acquired several ex-Navy tankers and Dromedaries (ships that carry both fuel and dry stores), some of which support scout missions in their original capacity, i.e. as resupply vessels. This is rapidly becoming known as the most boring job in the Scout Service apart from x-boat-pilot duty. As x-boat pilots joke; at least aboard an x-boat you’ve always got someone interesting to talk to.

Other tankers and dromedaries have been converted to scout base ships, which carry a flock of smaller vessels such as scout/couriers and survey scouts. They are designed to make use of the high jump capacity of naval tankers (typically jump-4) to reach an area quickly, then remain on station as a mobile base for the smaller vessels as they collect data. Thus far, several base-ship missions have been sent out, all of them to spinward.

The term ‘dromedary’ is given to support vessels that carry both fuel and dry stores, typically used to support small squadron or task force operations where a fleet tanker and auxiliaries would be wasteful.
Dromedaries are inefficient when used to support major fleets but are often pressed into that role. Most replenishment tasks are undertaken directly with the ship’s UNREP system but there is hangar space for six 100-ton craft such as Ilauus-class shuttles, which can be used for resupply tasks.

The Shuigabumudkhar-class is large enough to resupply destroyers but is not sufficient for cruiser or capital ship operations. In peacetime, dromedaries can sometimes be encountered ferrying cargo on behalf of Imperial armed forces, acting as additional resupply ships for army deployments or undertaking other mundane tasks.

Strategic mobility is standard for Imperial fleet assets (jump-4) and with 4g acceleration the Shuigabumudkhar-class is sufficiently agile to respond to most situations. It is lightly armored and armed to repel strikes by minor enemy combatants but relies on escorts for protection.

The Ilauus-class is defined by its builder as a fast multipurpose shuttle. It is commonly associated with the Shuigabumudkhar-class dromedary and other Imperial Navy replenishment ships but can be encountered in other roles. Its expense ensures that few non-government operators exist, although there are civilian concerns that perceive a need for a high-acceleration, lightly armored cargo hauler.

The Ilauus-class is essentially a cargo hold with a powerful drive. Its small bridge is very cramped, although this is offset by the provision of two crew cabins. Normal operating complement is four in naval hands – a pilot/commander, co-pilot, engineering technician and a gunner. Most Ilauus-class vessels are equipped with a dual sandcaster turret, increasing their chances of survival as they dash between fleet units in an emergency. Some are instead fitted with a laser armament and may even be pressed into service as customs, law enforcement or patrol assets.

The majority of craft are, however, carried aboard fleet logistics ships or orbital stations and are configured either as dry cargo haulers or fuellers for small vessels. Some are outfitted with seats or acceleration couches for personnel transportation. An experiment using these craft as forward fighter-control units met with some success but has not been implemented on a large scale.

SAXE Saxe is located almost at the extreme spinward end of the Spinward Main, just beyond the Imperial border. It is a large world with an exotic atmosphere, a nitrogen-
carbon-dioxide mix with very little oxygen. While not actively toxic to humans, it cannot support respiration; an unprotected human would breathe air in and out while they collapsed and died of anoxia. In order to avoid this unpleasant fate, a full air supply is needed although a sealed unit such as a vacc suit is not.

Saxe was settled by a rather optimistic mission that pushed ahead of the spread of Imperials into the Marches and was forced to make a home on Saxe when the colony ship’s systems began to fail. The ship was used as a habitat until more permanent structures could be created and then cannibalised for parts. It was some years before other colony missions arrived in the area and longer still before trade ships began calling at the rudimentary starport constructed outside Saxe City, as the original settlement became known. By this time, several other small towns had been constructed, although the colonists never spread far from their original landing area.

The world has gone through periods of oppression and internal conflict but today a liberal republican system is in place, with outlying settlements more or less independent. Vast tracts of Saxe remain untamed wildernesses which, in most areas, are entirely uncharted.

Saxe is friendly to the Imperium and visited by Navy patrols from time-to-time. Trade ships are rarer, although occasionally a jump-2 capable trader uses the world as a stopover on the Five Sisters-Darrian run. Otherwise, the colonists go about their business as they always have.

The atmosphere of Saxe cannot support land-based animal life, not even insects. This makes flowering plants unviable but others seem to do well and ferns, mosses and grass-like plants grow wherever there is soil to support them, while shallow watercourses are choked with primitive plant life that grows in great mats that can eventually form a natural, living dam. These plant-
dams create pools surrounded by swampy areas, which are ideal for riotous plant growth. The swamps in turn are home to primitive water-dwelling animals resembling shrimp, krill and similar crustaceans.

According to some scientists, Saxe is moving towards being a terra-prime world. As more swamps are created by plant-dams, the amount of plant life performing photosynthesis on Saxe is increasing, putting small but increasing amounts of oxygen into the air. It may be that this will someday lead to a breathable atmosphere and emergence of life onto land. For next few million years however, any enterprising lungfish-equivalent that sticks its head up to try breathing air for a change is going to be terminally disappointed.

Various scientific institutions have expressed an interest in studying the emergence of life on Saxe although the difficulty of getting to the world from major Imperial centres of learning in the Marches has prevented any real effort. Darrian scientists have visited the world and set-up a temporary research facility in the 1060s. This installation was little more than a set of prefabricated living quarters outside one of the smaller local towns and was hurriedly evacuated in the early months of the Fourth Frontier War. It still stands but the ever-pragmatic Saxans stripped the place within hours of the Darrians’ departure.

# DISTRICT 268 - SPINWARDS MARCHES-SUBSECTOR N

With the exception of two worlds (Mertactor and Mille Falcs – although several other worlds are client states), District 268 lies entirely outside the Imperium. It is, however, an area of Imperial interest. Such regions are designated as districts until such time as they are brought into the fold of the Imperium, at which point they are assigned a suitable subsector name along with the usual Imperial administrative apparatus and subsector fleet.

Most of the worlds of the subsector are on the Spinward Main, although its meandering path may require a detour into the Sword Worlds to reach some. All worlds are within jump-2 of the main, however. There are two areas of empty space within the subsector, which restrict traffic, lying to spinward-coreward and trailing-
rimward of Collace. They are unofficially known as the Greater and Lesser Collace Rifts respectively.

Imperial businesses are active in District 268, although McClellan Factors is engaged in actively squeezing out its rivals, sailing close to the wind with some of its tactics. The Imperial worlds of Mertactor and Mille Falcs are used as a regional base for Imperial firms trading into the subsector and administered from the neighboring Glisten subsector.

There is no subsector fleet, as such, for District 268 but patrols are maintained from the Five Sisters into the spinward side of the district and from Glisten into trailing. In addition, a small force of patrol vessels is based out of Mille Falcs. This is officially a detachment of the Glisten force but operates independently and comprises a handful of patrol vessels and escorts, backed up by a couple of old destroyers.

Probably the most important non-Imperial world in District 268 is Collace, a high-tech industrial world with pro-Imperial leanings and a strong contender for the role of subsector capital if and when the district is absorbed. However, many worlds want nothing of the Imperium and are passively resistant to Imperial expansion. Among them is Trexalon, which has been involved in a cold war with Collace for many years.
The government of Trexalon and the Trexalon Technical Consortium (TTC) it leads knows the Imperium will not tolerate armed resistance and can bring vast forces to bear if they start attacking Imperial facilities and ships.
Resistance is thus below the level that will trigger an Imperial response. There are, however, rumors that the TTC is behind a number of insurrections and similar problems on pro-Imperial worlds.

The world of Nirton is a Red Zone and there are three Amber Zones in the subsector. Pavabid is one of these, where the world government is a theocracy that follows the Pavabidian Heresy (as it is called elsewhere) of the Church of Stellar Divinity. Like other branches of the church, the Pavabidian version believes that stars are holy but maintains that all stars other than Pavabid’s are evil. Offworlders are from enemy stars and highly suspect. The world is governed from a flying palace that the locals, kept in a state of mid-tech ignorance, are told is kept aloft by divine favour. In fact, it was built on Glisten and uses gravitic technology.

Bowman is the site of one of the largest planetoid fields in existence, which covers five orbital paths rather than one. The system has only one planet, a gas giant known as Bowman Prime, whose moons are inhabited, as are sections of the vast Bowman Belt. Most of the prospecting and mining in Bowman is done by independents and small firms but LSP has a large facility

in-system and occasionally expands its operation, to the annoyance of locals who feel they are being edged out.

BOWMAN Bowman’s asteroid belt presents something of a classification problem, simply because it is so huge.
The Bowman Belt does not just fill the usual one orbital path that most belts do, but several. There are separate zones within the belt and there has been some debate as to whether these are actually several separate belts, in which case Bowman has an asteroid belt and several planetoid belts, or whether it is all one asteroid belt.

To the people who live and work here, the point is moot.
There is one belt and they live and work in one part of it. Distant regions of the belt are of no real importance because they are very far away.

In addition to the system’s star and the vast Bowman Belt there is one planet, a gas giant named Bowman Prime and its gaggle of moons. Clusters of planetoids are found at Bowman Prime’s Trojan points (ahead of and behind it in orbit).

The Bowman system is unusual in other ways.
Normally, the starport is located on the mainworld but Bowman’s port is actually on Alpha, the innermost moon of Bowman Prime, along with a scout base. This is a very small installation that operates a few ships on missions in local systems, as well as Bowman itself.
These are often of the ‘rock plotting’ sort, necessary for the maintenance of accurate charts but boring and unglamorous.

The population, numbering around 8,500, refer to themselves as Belters. There is no governmental structure in the Bowman Belt, nor any real body of law. The Belters live in small communities or family groups and are scattered widely. The main population concentrations, such as they are, can be found at the town of Garrison, which has grown up around the starport, and on some of the larger asteroids. The most important of these is Koenig’s Rock, in the main belt.

In addition to the Belter population, there are about 3,000 ‘company men’ in the system at any one time, not residents or Belters but well-paid employees of Ling Standard Products. LSP has more or less taken over the Trailing Trojan cluster of asteroids and runs off independents with armed cutters and mercenary security troopers. There is an LSP company town in the cluster, from which mining platforms are sent out to nearby asteroids to extract whatever minerals can be found

there. Ingots of ore are then launched by mass driver to the two LSP stations near Garrison.

These two stations are owned and operated by LSP but required by contract to process ore extracted by the Belter population too. They orbit Bowman Prime at the Trojan points of Alpha, from where it is easy to transport the processed ore to the port for shipment out of the system.

A third station orbits the outer edge of Bowman Prime’s ring system but does not mine for ore. Instead, it extracts a range of chemicals, as well as oxygen and hydrogen, from ice chunks collected from Bowman Prime’s extensive ring system.

There are two other operations taking place in the Bowman system. The first is a small archaeological dig underway on Epsilon, one of Bowman Prime’s larger moons, discovered in 1093 to be the site of a pre- Maghiz Darrian outpost. Meanwhile, salvage crews continue to pick over the extensive field of starship wreckage drifting among the asteroids of Bowman Prime’s leading Trojan cluster. This dates from the period just after the Second Frontier War, when a Sword World fleet that had refused to surrender, and carried out a highly successful commerce-raiding campaign, was finally tracked to its base in the cluster and eliminated. The exploits of this fleet, under Admiral Denisov, form part of Sword Worlder naval tradition to this day.

PAVABID Pavabid is an independent mid-tech world lying a few parsecs from Imperial space on the most rimward arm of the Spinward Main. It is a very habitable world for humans, with slightly lighter gravity than Earth, a standard atmosphere and plenty of water.
Unsurprisingly, Pavabid was settled early in the history of the Marches and the population steadily grew to its present level, about 700 million.

At some point in the world’s history, the Church of Stellar Divinity became the world’s most widely practised religion and later the official state religion worldwide. The Church of Stellar Divinity turned Pavabid into a theocracy but, without offworld influences, the religion took a sinister turn and the wider church has declared the Pavabid theocracy an official heresy and condemns the actions of the world government. The Pavabidian Heresy maintains that while all stars are indeed gods, only Pavabid’s star is good and benign.
In order to protect them from the influences of enemy stars, the people are kept isolated and not permitted contact with offworlders. Travel to other systems is out of the question.

Offworld visitors to Pavabid are restricted to a trade enclave around the starport, guarded by church troops and staffed by the most zealous and incorruptibly faithful officials. Law enforcement within the enclave is strict, equivalent to Law Level 8. Outside, it is nearer Law Level 10, with church-imposed rules intruding into all aspects of daily life.

The people of Pavabid are content and kept that way by rules that prevent them from finding out about ways of life that they might like better. All the same, life is not bad. Pavabid is covered in small towns built around light industry, with agricultural regions in between. Most Pavabidians simply cannot conceive of any other life.

The head of the Pavabidian government is known as the Son of the Star and considered to be the embodiment of the star’s consciousness, making him both divine and infallible. He dwells in a floating palace that moves around Pavabid at his whim and is allegedly held aloft by the hand of god; in fact it is a technological construct using impressive but mundane gravitic technology.

Pavabid lies directly between Collace and Trexalon, two worlds that are bitter rivals and hold diametrically opposed views about the Imperium. Collace supports Imperial expansion into District 268 and hopes to become the subsector capital, while Trexalon is doing everything it can to hamper Imperial advancement and delay the region’s incorporation into the Imperium.

Since both Collace and Trexalon ships come to trade at the port, clashes of interests occur from time-to-
time on Pavabid. However, in recent months things have taken a turn for the worse. A survey of Pavabid discovered extensive deposits of platinum and, more importantly, iridium. Iridium is used in the production of jump drives and is extremely valuable. Collace in particular is interested in obtaining access to these deposits, which is strictly forbidden by church law as offworlders are not allowed outside the trade enclave.
The locals do not have the technology to extract it themselves, making it impossible for Collace or anyone else to obtain iridium from Pavabid.

Collace and Trexalon both believe that the other is engaged in underhand methods to gain access to the iridium deposits and neither is willing to allow the other to pull off a coup and gain control of this rich resource. Since both believe the other is willing to use covert agents on Pavabid, counter-agents are necessarily deployed. As yet there have been no serious incidents but it is only a matter of time before the shadow war spills over and becomes impossible for the church not to notice. No-one can predict what might happen then.

TALOS Lying just outside the Imperial border, but on the District 268 arm of the Spinward Main, Talos is a chilly world with too little atmosphere for humans to breathe unaided. Its surface is mostly cold desert or rocky badlands, with little life outside the sealed environment of the world’s settlements. There is one large city, containing most of the 800,000 or so population, plus a few outlying towns. Most of these are specialist installations; typically industrial towns or agricultural areas surrounded by large expanses of pressure-
controlled farmland.

Talos reached a comfortable TL9 many years ago and has seen little progress since. The hereditary noble class that runs the world sees little point in diverting funds from its own lavish lifestyles to investment that might

someday result in an improved industrial output or more advanced technology; the present situation is good enough to support the nobility in style and to keep the population reasonably content, and there is no perceived need to change anything.

Talos’ starport is extremely basic and receives little traffic – most ships turn around at Mertractor or Collace depending on their origins, with just a few making regular cross-border runs. However, there are rumors that the nobility have arrangements with a few favoured merchant captains, enabling them to get people and items across the Imperial border for those willing to pay the steep fee. This service, if it exists at all, is reserved for those favoured by the nobility. According to rumor, playing politics or winning over some of the nobles can open doors for those who know how to fit into Talos’
isolationist society.

![[BtC-GlistenSubsector.jpg]]
Glisten lies entirely within the Imperium, for many years a backwater lying on an unimportant frontier, receiving little attention. X-boats bound for Imperial holdings in Pax Rulin (rimward, towards the Great Rift) ran through Glisten itself but otherwise there was little need to develop the region. The opening of District 268 for Imperial expansion in 940 brought greater importance to Glisten and has stimulated investment.

Many of the worlds in the subsector lie on the Spinward Main, although the Glisten Arm is a lightly travelled part of the main. It terminates at Bendor, however a jump-2 capable ship can reach any world in the subsector and proceed beyond into Trin’s Veil and finally back to Mora.

The subsector is the responsibility of the 100th Fleet, with its headquarters at Glisten itself. The fleet is understrength and contains mostly small or obsolescent vessels, its strength further diluted by the need to patrol District 268 and maintain a detachment there. The Sector Fleet also has a light presence in the subsector; the region is a long way from likely combat zones in a war with the Zhodani.

There are seven Amber Zones in Glisten and one world that, while not actually a Red Zone, has access strictly restricted. This is Mithras, an Imperial prison world.
Environmental conditions are harsh, making survival outside the prison complex problematical at best.
Although some prisoners are life-long exiles, there are separate areas for those serving long but finite sentences. The complex has a good rehabilitation record and a small, attached institution for the criminally insane.

Egypt is a major training base for Colonial Office personnel. Originally set up for a large-scale move into District 268, the facility has supported several operations elsewhere and offers a retraining service for ex-Imperial service personnel seeking to make a new life on a frontier world.

Glisten itself is named for the capital settlement in a system characterised by cities built in the two asteroid belts. Originally called Gliss Ten (Gliss being the name of the system’s star), Glisten City rose to become the system capital and eventually the administrative centre for the subsector. There are many other large cities throughout the system’s belts, most specialising in one aspect of industry or economic endeavor.

Marastan is an Imperial reserve world. Although access to the starport and associated city are unrestricted, only properly accredited academics are permitted access to the world at large, as Marastan is preserved as a showcase for plant and animal species collected by the Scout Service. Some of these are now extinct in their home environment but survive on Marastan in carefully segregated reserves.

Other worlds of interest in the subsector include Romar, source of dust-spice, a narcotic valued by the Aslan, and Melior, whose population is about half Jonkeereen.
Callia also has a significant Jonkeereen minority, numbering around a quarter of the total population.

BICORNN Lying off the main trade routes, Bicornn is a low-tech world of no great importance. Its local population have a stable TL2 society but never progressed further. There is no reason why the locals could not develop their technological base but this would require enormous external investment before any returns were made. Few would consider the effort worthwhile even if it were not for the risks. Bicornn is heavily balkanised and its population are engaged in a war of survival against a burrowing arachnoid species known as Krvn. These creatures resemble the Chamax, a hugely destructive species found to spinward of the region, but are not thought to be related. However, the alarm caused by a possible connection with the Chamax sparked a research project that made the startling discovery that Krvn are present on a number of other worlds in quite distant regions. How this came to be is not yet apparent, although teams of Imperial researchers regularly risk their lives on Bicornn to find out.

KRVN

Krvn are omnivorous and capable of burrowing through dense soil. Their nests contain dozens, perhaps hundreds, of workers and one or more large breeders which are rarely seen aboveground.

CRAW Craw is located 3 parsecs from Glisten, on the Spinward Main. Much of the surface is desert or rocky badlands, with the only large body of water a sea at the northern pole. Away from the coasts, the terrain varies from classic sand deserts complete with dunes, through broken rocky regions, to mountainous areas, some with active volcanoes. None of these regions receives much in the way of rainfall and average temperatures are high, accounting for the general lack of plant life.
What there is tends to be tough and wiry, and particularly unattractive.

Although Craw is a small world, it is of above-average density and maintains a standard-pressure atmosphere.
However, as a result of the lack of plant life, there is relatively little oxygen in the air. It is still possible to breathe unassisted but humans not accustomed to the environment find it uncomfortable, tire easily and sometimes suffer from the effects of altitude sickness.
Filter masks are of no benefit as it is not airborne particles that makes the atmosphere difficult to breathe but the lack of oxygen. An oxygen mask, or a respirator mask is necessary for offworlders lacking several weeks of acclimatization.

Despite its unappealing nature, Craw is home to some seven million or so humans. About two-thirds of the population live around the shores of the polar sea; the remainder dwell in settlements of moderate size across the globe, wherever water can be found. Government is by a democratic system of representation, although the difficulty of communicating or travelling over long distances means that outlying areas are not properly represented and more or less autonomous.

Humans on Craw are descended from early colonists who came to exploit mineral resources. The mission was not a great success and, due to a number of factors, the colony went through a survival/subsistence phase that lasted for centuries before beginning to recover. Today, as a backwater world with little in the way of exports to pay for imported technology, the people of Craw have a long way to go in order to build themselves a technological society.

A major factor in the local economy is the use of native labour. Craw is home to tribes of intelligent humanoids whose considerable numbers are not counted as part of the world population. These natives are well adapted to the local conditions and can function better than an acclimatised human, making them an ideal source of agricultural and heavy labour. The tribes that live

apart from humans have a primitive TL1 society, while those with human contact are generally capable of maintaining TL2.

The tribes close to human settlements are dominated by them to the point where natives serve as sepoys in an army that serves mainly to keep down the tribes and impose a condition not far short of slavery. Native workers (some come right out and call them slaves) are subject to very strict restrictions as they labour for the benefit of the human population. This has led to a state of near-constant conflict between the human population and their ‘allied’ natives, versus the ‘wild’ natives who have greater numbers but low-tech equipment.

Slavery is illegal in the Imperium but there has been no Imperial intervention. One reason for this is that demolishing the current system on Craw would result in the human population being evacuated or else either starve or be killed by enraged natives. If evacuated, where would they go?

A number of Imperial activists have arrived on Craw to investigate the situation and report on the shameful exploitation of a native population. They have a difficult task ahead; the human population resents them, the wild natives will kill them (as they would any other human) and, even if they succeed, they must convince an Imperial agency to act on behalf of the natives. No great changes can be expected any time soon.

There is another offworld group on Craw whose welcome is warmer in some quarters. A team from a mid-sized mineral company, InStarSpec, created a base of operations at Craw Starport (incidentally upgrading it to Class C) and secured it with mercenaries. InStarSpec then set-up a handful of small mineral extraction bases and exports what they produce via the port, paying the locals a fee for the privilege. While modest, this represents hard cash that can be invested by the world government. As the InStarSpec operation expands, the locals will be able to bring more offworld technology to Craw. Already the port town is a strange mix of local and imported technology, bought mainly from TL5-7 worlds.

In addition to the single merchant vessel chartered by InStarSpec to run between Craw and Glisten, other ships are beginning to trickle in and there are hopes that regular trade may follow. Time will tell whether Craw becomes a great success story built on a partnership of local government and offworld mining corporation, with a bit of slave-labour thrown in, or whether the corporation ends up running the world –
locals, natives, and all.

GLISTEN The Glisten system is well placed to act as a communications and trade hub for the surrounding subsector; one reason why it was chosen as the subsector capital. It is located at the ‘wrong end’ of the Spinward Main and getting there requires a long meandering trip through several subsectors, some of which are hazardous, others merely backwaters. For commercial traffic this is simply not viable and, as a means to move information, it is extremely slow.

Most traffic into Glisten comes in via the jump-2 link through Trin’s Veil or the jump-3 link to Strouden in Lunion. What jump-1 traffic there is tends to be confined to the local cluster and nearby sections of the main in District 268. This has created a distinct cultural region around Glisten, with its own accents and variations on social customs

The Glisten system is centered on the star Gliss, orbited by a single gas giant and no rocky planets.
The population of the system numbers in the billions, housed in large cities built on asteroids all throughout the inner asteroid belt. Each city has its own administrative apparatus, all of which ultimately form part of the efficient, but dull, Glisten Co-ordinating Authority, a civil service government that runs the system. Laws are moderate but, with so many settlements housing vast numbers of people and scattered across an entire system, a rather stodgy administration has emerged with red tape wrapped around almost any activity.

The capital is Glisten City, a huge metropolis that grew out of the much smaller Gliss Ten settlement chosen as administrative centre for the system long ago. Glisten City is the site of the huge starport and serves as the main centre for trade and business, as well as the administrative capital. Many other cities are specialized in their industrial or social activities, such as agriculture, light and heavy industry, and there is even an artists’ colony. There are a number of more general settlements but these are of much lesser economic importance than the great centres for trade and industry.

With its large industrial complexes and extremely high Tech Level, Glisten is an important exporter of technological goods across the sector and beyond. Its

shipyards are widely renowned, mostly located in the outer Pluvis Belt. Among them is an enormous yard owned and operated by Ling Standard Products, as well as smaller and more specialized shipbuilders such as Bilstein Yards. The Pluvis Belt is also the site of Glisten’s naval base, home port of the subsector fleet.
The immediate region around the base is a restricted area and heavily patrolled, with sensor outposts constructed on a number of asteroids to give wider coverage.

Glisten also has an extensive scout base, located in the main belt near the starport. In addition to a huge fleet of cutters dedicated to the ongoing effort to chart and catalogue every asteroid in the system, the base is home to a flotilla of communications and exploration vessels.

The Glisten system attracts large numbers of students to its academic institutions, which include the Glisten Institute of Planetological Studies (GLIPS) and the Mining School of Glisten, which is associated with GLIPS but autonomous. The Mining School receives funding from several corporate and megacorporate sources, which offer scholarships for promising students in the prospecting, extraction, processing and management disciplines. Ex-students are recruited in large numbers by mining corporations across the sector.

There is also a community of what could be called true Belters within the system. Although not officially part of Glisten’s population, the Belters are subject to local laws while in-system and most are willing to comply, more or less. However, there are groups who routinely ignore comm-channel restrictions, traffic control instructions and other governmental rules which are considered very important by the people and government of Glisten.
Enforcement of these rules is usually accompanied by howls of protest from Belter groups who claim they are being persecuted. For the Belters’ part, most are just trying to make their way in the universe with a little prospecting or working a claim on some outsystem asteroid. The shiny cities of the main belt are built on asteroids but the people who live there are no more Belters than planetsiders are - the Belters have nothing in common with them and are happy to just go their own way. Local laws are mostly followed but a significant segment of the Belter community considers that planetsider laws and rules do not apply to those who have to make a living in the ‘real universe’ of deep space.

# TRIN’S VEIL - SPINWARDS MARCHES-SUBSECTOR P

Trin’s Veil gets its name from the reflective debris cloud that surrounds Trin, the subsector capital. This is the remains of a shattered moon and makes the night sky on Trin a glorious sight. It also interferes with navigation close to the world.

The subsector is entirely within the Imperium and backs onto the Gulf subsector of Deneb. Although the Spinward Main does not run through Trin’s Veil, a jump-
2 ship can connect to it at Hexos (in Mora) or Bendor (in Glisten) after a simple transit via the Palique, Katarulu

TRIN'S VEIL SUBSECTOR

### Spinward Marches

### P

KIAN

ANIMAL HITS SPEED Kian 30 9m SKILLS Athletics (endurance) 1, Recon 1 ATTACKS Kick (1D)
TRAITS Heightened Senses, Large (+1)
BEHAVIOUR Herbivore, Grazer

The Kian is a mammal, although it resembles a large flightless bird much like an ostrich. Kian are thought to have originated on Prilissa in the Spinward Marches but this is not certain. They are used as riding animals on many worlds and are more agile than horses. However, Kian cannot carry as much as a horse and, whilst faster over short distances, are slowed on a long march.

Kian have fur and, in some cases, vestigial forelimbs.
This trait is common on some worlds and completely absent on others, suggesting that distinct breeds or sub-species are beginning to appear. Kian are favoured by ranchers on many backwater worlds as they do not require the imported parts for maintenance that a vehicle would. They are herded for meat on some worlds or used to control and watch over herds of other farm

and Dodds clusters. Jump-2 is also required to reach Trin itself. However, trade is conducted on a large scale within the subsector’s two main star clusters using jump-1 ships.

Trin’s Veil is the responsibility of the 207th Fleet which, like the 100th in Glisten, is somewhat understrength.
Patrols are maintained from the fleet headquarters at Katarulu and bases on Murchison and Trin. The Sector Fleet maintains a reserve at Trin but this is a battle-
reserve and rarely has vessels available for patrol work.

There are no Red Zones in the subsector, but there are seven Amber Zones (Hazel, Edenelt, Hammermium, Robin, Dodds, Zephyr, and Thisbe). Thisbe is not strictly an Amber Zone but can sometimes be dangerous; a long-
term project is underway to improve the world’s marginal atmosphere and hydrographics by transporting ice asteroids from the outsystem. Most are simply broken into small chunks and dispatched in a decaying orbit that will cause them to burn up in what little atmosphere there is, thereby adding to it. A few fragments do reach the ground, potentially causing a hazard.

The world of Prilissa is the origin of the Kian, a large flightless bird used as a beast of burden on many worlds and ceremonial mounts for the Imperial Household Cavalry. Kian fulfil many of the same functions as horses and have been exported almost as widely.

ARAMIS There are two worlds named Aramis in the Spinward Marches. The world named Aramis in the subsector also named Aramis is an important trade centre and naval base. The ‘other’ Aramis, in Trin’s Veil, is in many ways the opposite.

This Aramis possesses something its more prosperous namesake does not; a habitable ‘shirtsleeves’
environment. Gravity is slightly lighter than Terra-normal and the air is quite thin. This is not a major problem, but un-acclimatised visitors tire quickly and can become light-headed from moderate activity. To offset this, most ships approaching Aramis gradually lower their internal air pressure during the week in jump, so most starfarers

animals. Kian generally get along well with horses, although most of those who use them choose one or the other as the riding style is quite different.

arrive already acclimatised to local conditions. While not perfect, this enables visitors to avoid any serious effects.

Aramis is a very wet world, with extensive oceans and relatively little useable land. Nevertheless, this is more than enough for the population, which numbers in the tens of millions. There is one moderately sized continent and many large islands or archipelagos. Most of the latter have their own small nations, which vary considerably in terms of government and characteristics but conform to TL5-6.

One island nation is, in fact, an industrial enclave on long-term lease to Peabody Instrument, a firm specialising in the manufacture of scientific apparatus and instrumentation components for vehicles and industrial applications. The Peabody enclave has a large population – fully half a million people – and is also the site of the starport, giving visitors to Aramis the impression that it is a high-tech industrialised world. In fact, beyond the shores of the Peabody enclave, which takes up the entire mass of the large island, Aramis is a mess of small mid-tech societies.

The mainland is home to the majority of the population, with several states along the coastal strip, mostly known as ‘claves (corrupted from enclave) and usually named for their founders. These are independent and often unfriendly, if not downright hostile, to one another. Each
‘clave consists of a few small towns or a couple of larger ones, surrounded by villages and farms.

Inland is a wide outback region that is thinly populated and has no formal government. Most outbackers live in steads protected by a simple earth rampart with firing positions. Raids and feuds are not uncommon and outbacker towns are similarly protected. As a general rule, outbackers do not like coasters (or ‘clavers as they are sometimes known), although there is some trade between coasters and outbackers, just as there is trade between different ‘claves. For the most part, wary, armed mistrust is the order of the day.

From time-to-time ‘claves come into conflict, usually over a disputed border or resources. Similarly, the
‘claves will sometimes drive nearby outbackers off their land, either to seize their resources or improve the security. Hostility between coasters and outbackers probably began in this way, although the origins of the many disputes and grudges are long forgotten. Naturally, the various ‘claves are willing to use outbackers against one another, either by inciting a group of outbackers to harass another ‘clave or raising units of irregular troops from among outbackers for a more direct confrontation.
This serves to ensure the cycle of violence and mistrust is not broken.

Most of Aramis is tense but not especially dangerous.
Offworlders are generally recognized as not involved in the many feuds and may be offered courteous hospitality amid what amounts to a war zone. There are those who would like to engineer a situation where rivals inadvertently kill offworlders but for the most part visitors are more likely to be seen as useful contacts or honored guests. There is a strong tradition of hospitality towards those you are not actively feuding against on Aramis.

Offworlders are, however, not all that common outside the Peabody Enclave. Aramis is off the beaten track as far as interstellar commerce goes and although the Peabody installation has a fair amount of high-tech manufacturing equipment, this is used for its own business applications and not available to generate trade goods for the world.

Exports from the various ‘claves and island nations are modest in quantity and constructed at TL6, making it difficult to bring in revenue. Those ‘claves and nations that can find something offworlders want, and who invest the proceeds wisely, will eventually leave their rivals behind or absorb them.

TEE-TEE-TEE The origins of Tee-Tee-Tee’s strange name are lost in the mists of time, although it is thought to be a corruption of an old astrographical designation. The locals typically call their world Threet (a contraction of ‘Three-Ts’), which permits endless variations on the theme of ‘Threet Fleet’ when referring to the world’s trade fleet. Tee-Tee-
Tee is ruled by a consortium of hereditary trader princes, who make their money offworld on the spacelanes; the planet itself is just a base of operations and has little industry of its own. The Threet Fleet can be encountered all over the sector and beyond, with some merchant cruisers staying out for years at a time.

Tee-Tee-Tee is otherwise a typical rockball planet with the merest trace of atmospheric gas. Its 900,000 or so inhabitants are mostly employed in the households of the merchant princes – Tee-Tee-Tee is said to have more accountants per square kilometre of its surface than almost any other world this side of Core sector –
or in supporting industries at the small but efficient starport. The world has a spectacular ring system thought to be the result of a collision between moons in the distant past. The spectacle is noted as one of the ‘wonders of the Marches’ and frequently visited by tourist ships. The downport makes a steady profit from catering to these vessels, although tourism is only as small sideline compared to the real business of interstellar commerce.

TRIN Colonized not long after Mora, Trin is the ‘back door to the Marches’. It can be reached from Deneb by an easy jump-2 route through well-developed worlds, with good ports in the Gulf subsector. This creates a lucrative trade run into Trin, from where it is possible to head coreward and join the Spinward Main or spinward towards Glisten.
Large quantities of goods move through Trin’s excellent highport, which has many brokerages and commercial dispute resolution firms. Most ships are larger types; corporate freighters and liners rather than small, privately-owned ships but Trin’s shipyards are used for refits by many smaller operators - at least, those who can afford the fees.

Trin Highport also hosts a very large independent merchant academy, the Imperial Trin Institute of Commerce (ITIC). ITIC trains merchant spacer crews but also offers courses in related areas such as brokerage and business law. Many of the personnel on the ‘spacer’
side of the institute also undertake Naval Reservist training at the Imperial Navy base in the system.

This serves as headquarters for the subsector fleet and a base for heavy squadrons of the Sector Fleet.
Trin’s system defences are commanded from a ground installation on Trin itself but many of the system defence vessels berth at the naval base. Trin also has a small scout base to serve the communications network.

There is one other major facility in the Trin system, the world of Ling Standard Products Spinward, named for the corporate facility built on it in the early years of corporate expansion into the area. Originally planned to take over as regional headquarters from the facility at Mora, it instead became a manufacturing site with a side line in researching improved industrial techniques.

Trin itself is a medium-sized world with a dense, tainted atmosphere and low water coverage. There are no moons, although Trin had one in the past. The cloud of reflective debris that makes dawn and sunset so spectacular on Trin is the remnant of this satellite, which broke up due to gravitational stresses.

The world’s population numbers in the tens of billions.
As with many high population worlds, Trin’s people are concentrated in very large cities surrounded by agricultural areas. Even with such a large population, there is plenty of land and well-regulated agriculture, using high-technology methods, is capable of feeding Trin’s billions without resorting to bulk food imports or low-quality subsistence rations. Indeed, Trin is a strong contender for one of the best places to live in Charted Space; the cities are not crowded and very well-designed by a civilization that has had gravitic transportation since the world was colonized. Buildings are characteristically tall, with wide spaces between them filled with parks and recreation facilities. Most Trin residents are used to thinking in three dimensions when getting about, the idea of being stuck at ground level is foreign to them.

Ground vehicles are not common on Trin, other than for industrial and agricultural use, and mobility within large buildings. Getting around in the city involves fast, efficient maglev trains or grav buses floating between landing areas on the exterior of buildings. Maglev rail lines link the cities, along with high-speed grav vehicles.

The general populace are well educated and enjoy a very high quality of life. Upward mobility is available through promotions at work but for those of a different bent it is possible to obtain government sponsorship (equivalent to an appropriate salary) for excellence or promise in areas as diverse as art, writing, music and sport. There are poor people on Trin, of course, but there is a highly effective social safety net, which is normally sufficient to allow anyone who has fallen on hard times to start climbing back to prosperity. Being flat broke on Trin is not quite the same as being down and out on some frontier world or mid-tech industrial hellhole.

Trin’s effective and efficient social system tends to produce motivated and skilled people. Coupled with a Tech Level as high as anywhere in the Imperium, this has made Trin an industrial powerhouse whose goods are exported across the sector and far beyond. That in turn generates a level of wealth only dreamed of on many worlds.

Trin’s government is typical of high-population worlds, in that it has a semi-corporate, bureaucratic structure that follows established practices. Stability is considered the priority in most areas of governance - Trin is so far ahead of the pack that reckless growth is undesirable and carries a risk of damaging the world’s enviable position as one of the best and richest places to live this side of the Imperial Core. Trin has it good and prefers to play safe to ensure things stay that way.

However, Trin is an economic centre and her government understands that flexibility and rapid responses are necessary for success in commerce. Calculated risks are acceptable, so long as there is always enough in reserve to cover a loss and nothing is ventured that cannot be done without. Cautious speculation is the order of the day in the economic arena and other areas too, such as scientific research.

This innate caution has, oddly enough, prompted the government of Trin to invest in some very unlikely scientific projects, economic investments and exploratory missions. If there is a risk that someone else might make a big score from a project that Trin might miss, then the government is willing to invest, just in case it pays off. This attitude puzzles some outsiders but it makes sense to those who grew up on Trin. They explain that: ‘When you’re rich, you can afford to throw a little money into blue-sky projects. If it’s a bust, nothing is really lost. But once in a while you get lucky.’

# DENEB

Deneb sector lies beyond the Great Rift, around 12 months’ travel from the Imperial core aboard a standard jump-2 liner. It is a place of contrasts, with highly developed economies and one of the highest-tech worlds in the Imperium counterpointed by backwaters and a troubled coreward frontier.

Most of the 385 star systems of Deneb sector lie within the Imperial border, including Deneb itself. Deneb is one of the brightest stars in the night sky and, according to local legend, it was the beacon that drew Imperial explorers onward through Corridor and ultimately to the current Imperial frontier in the Spinward Marches sector.
The truth of this is debatable but Deneb has been used as a calibration point by navigators for centuries.

The politics of Deneb sector have always been vigorous, with subsector dukes vying for greater influence over their neighbors and incursions by Vargr from just across the coreward border. The region saw bitter fighting during the civil war of the 600s and there are those who still bear grudges. The Humbolt noble house, architects of Deneb’s early expansion, were exiled after the war but continue to cast a long shadow over the region.
Politics is a dangerous game in this sector and even the humblest merchant captain can be drawn into a web of highly complex machinations. Those with ambition can find opportunities here but they must tread carefully; the powers of Deneb are not merciful towards those who interfere in their plans.

First Impressions There are distinct regions within Deneb, with their own character. As a general rule, Deneb is more developed than the neighboring Spinward Marches but there are backwaters and frontier zones where centuries of progress seem to have passed unnoticed. In some cases, trade routes run through these regions, which are subject to sporadic attempts to pacify troubled systems or upgrade their economies to make them an asset to the sector as a whole. For the most part, however, backwaters seem destined to remain so.

Between the major worlds, the x-boat routes and merchant shipping lanes are filled with liners and freighters, many operated by large corporations; large-
scale freighting and bulk cargo are big business in Deneb. Some extremely long-range freighters come all the way from the Imperial core, terminating at Mora or Rhylanor in the Spinward Marches. More commonly, long-distance cargoes are shipped in stages, sometimes as a whole and sometimes broken up into ever-smaller lots as they move farther from the Imperial heartland.

The most famous world in Deneb is Vincennes, partly for its TL16 and partly for its role as the base of the infamous Humbolt family. At Vincennes, the FGMP-
16 prototype is undergoing second-generation trials.
Organic computers are on the horizon, promising a large improvement in starship automation. Droptank configurations hold out hope of fuel-minimal freighters and liners, and experimental jump-6 x-boats are being tested between Magash and Kubishush, and Kubishush and Vincennes. This position at the cutting edge of Imperial technology should make Vincennes the foremost world, and its duke the foremost noble, in the sector. At least, the Duke of Vincennes thinks so. Others are determined to make sure this does not happen.

There are six Imperial research stations in Deneb sector, pushing the limits of science, yet just a few parsecs away are worlds trapped in a cycle of conflict and economic collapse. Mercenaries, privateers and smugglers find these worlds a constant source of employment, whilst the Imperial Navy struggles to maintain order amid conflicting political directives, corsair raids from across the border and the occasional trade war or armed confrontation between the subsector dukes.

A place of contrasts and one where apparent success can lead to unexpected intervention from a powerful corporation or noble house whose carefully laid schemes have been disrupted. In the words of the great social historian Malden Arkhesaar ‘Deneb sector: Bright lights.
Lots of shadows.’

Sittin’ on the Dock There is a direct correlation between the number of ships coming into a world’s port from any given power and the amount of influence it has. Movement of people and goods leads to a merging of cultures, along with the knowledge that the nearby power will quickly come to know about events on the world and is likely to care about them. Thus, jump-1 clusters and mains are important not only in economic terms but also politically – all those little tramp freighters carry culture and political influence from world-
to-world.

The converse is also true; an isolated world will perceive less influence from any given power and one of the indicators that a subsector duke wishes to gain control of a world is an increase in the number of ships using its port. Even if these are independents or third-party vessels, it is not difficult to trace the increase back to origins. The intelligence agencies of all duchies keep careful watch on ships coming and going in their ports and there is good money to be made by independents from selling accurate shipping rosters from more distant worlds to the intelligence services. Of course, this third-party information might be sold to more than one client and it might have been manipulated, so wherever possible duchies put their own agents in place or work with trusted regulars who have established the reliability of their data.

HISTORICAL

PERSPECTIVE There was life in Deneb sector long before the Ancients uplifted humans and Vargr and seeded them throughout Charted Space. Much of that life was basic; the progenitors of today’s flora and fauna found on many worlds throughout the sector. Even there, a few anomalies exist; species that appear integrated into local ecosystems so well that they seem to have evolved there but which did not. Some transplanted species seem to date back millions of years, long before the Ancients developed the jump drive and began exploring the region.

Various hypotheses exist about how this came to be.
Did some species travel the stars of the region in the extremely distant past? This idea is popular among the sort of scientists who get invited to take part in low-
budget chat shows but there is no evidence to support it. Is this an extreme case of parallel evolution or did the Ancients integrate these species with local life as an experiment? None of these ideas seem particularly strong but there is no better explanation.

There is archeological evidence of intelligent life in Deneb long before humans or even the Ancients arrived.
Most of these species got no further than a Neolithic level of tool use and on a few worlds stone-age societies survived until humans colonized the region. The remains of a few cultures that got further and developed a low-tech civilization are studied by Imperial scientists interested in how they came to an end.

It is known that the Ancients were active in Deneb, leaving behind a few sites of interest and the odd isolated artefact. They seeded humans on some worlds and transplanted the Vargr to the region coreward of Deneb. After the Ancients disappeared, these societies went their own way, with Vargr eventually filtering into Deneb through gradual expansion. Human settlers arrived during the First and Second Imperium but it was not until after the Long Night that most of Deneb was colonized by humans pushing through Corridor.

Little more than legends remain from these early eras.
It is said that the Deneb system itself was colonized around -2400 by Vilani fleeing the collapse of the First Imperium. Certainly there were humans of Vilani descent dwelling on Deneb when the first scouts from the Third Imperium arrived but Deneb seems a rather odd choice for a place to settle. A sparse system orbiting a giant star, with an uninviting mainworld, Deneb was a lot less welcoming than many other worlds in the region. Some systems were settled around the same time and perhaps one of them was intended as the main colony instead.

Be that as it may, the Vilani colony on Deneb regressed during the Long Night but regained jump technology by the time the Third Imperium arrived. Some Vilani colonies died out but survivors were recontacted and formed the basis of the Lidash League, which was extant at the time Imperial explorers arrived.

Similarly, around -1700 a large group of Solomani exiles settled on Vincennes. The choice of that particular world remains a mystery; again, Vincennes was hardly the most promising prospect in the region. Conditions were tough enough that the colony died out during the Long Night.
The legend of Vincennes continued to hold a strange fascination for the Solomani people, however. Another group of exiles would later claim it as their home.

A Study in Denebian Politics Jehun is located on the trailing-rimward fringe of the Sabine subsector and therefore within the Duchy of Sabine. It is a garden world, rich and agricultural, but has a small economic base and thus little power of its own. Jehun should be able to rely on the protection of the subsector fleet but this is subject to the influence of the Duke of Sabine. The duke does not directly control the fleet’s deployments but can apply pressure for ships to be sent there or elsewhere depending on his own agenda and how favourably inclined he is towards Jehun.

Jehun is closer to important worlds in the duchies of Inar and Vincennes than the centre of power in Sabine and receives more ships from these regions. Its agricultural exports are of some importance to nearby major worlds - Thengin in the Duchy of Sabine, Kubishush in the Duchy of Inar, Northammon and Vincennes in the Duchy of Vincennes. In addition, as a border system, Jehun is vulnerable to the influence of Inar and Vincennes. Both have repeatedly attempted to gain control, if only to weaken the position of Sabine or each other.

The local TAS feeds give a feel for local politics:
1102-110 Magash/Sabine: Magash warmly welcomes the new Vincennes ambassador to the subsector capital.
Sir Rikeb replaces the late Mr. Thaeho of Northammon, who died of natural causes last month while presiding over the embassy. An elite Sabine guard is placed at the disposal of Sir Rikeb.

1102-143 Kubishush/Inar: Several members of an undisclosed noble family were kidnapped in a recent raid by privateers on Hessel. Their release was quickly negotiated in return for processed radioactives, a move condemned by a spokesperson from the Duchy of Sabine. Representatives from Vincennes and Magash have loudly denounced the Hessel kidnapping and called for the Inar subsector fleet to step up patrols in the region.

1102-190 Northammon/Vincennes: The execution of a Sabine diplomat accused of espionage has drawn condemnation from the Duchy of Sabine. Sources on Vincennes state that the diplomat was found offworld, in the Peres system, in possession of classified research data. In a strongly worded statement, Sabine protests that the execution was performed ‘without due process’.

1102-199 Thengin/Sabine: A clash between mercenary forces and a vessel of the 195th Fleet off Thengin has been justified by the mercenaries’ patron, who claims the subsector forces looked and acted like pirates. This assertion has been dismissed by both the 195th Fleet itself and the office of the Duke of Sabine as ‘nonsense’.

1102-204 Inar/Inar: Vessels of the Duke of Inar’s personal forces have exchanged fire with a destroyer-sized intruder within the borders of the Inar subsector. The intruder identified itself as belonging to the Duchy of Vincennes but would not follow proper communication protocols nor state its business. Damage on both sides is said to be slight but the incident has sparked new tensions between Inar and Vincennes.

1102-218 Jehun/Sabine: Count Ara Pacis has refused to comment on his withdrawal from Jehun’s annual trade cartel forums upon the arrival of an ambassador from Vincennes. Sources on Jehun report the count as being visibly angry and barely able to tolerate the presence of the ambassador.

1102-250 Northammon/Vincennes: An explosion at Northammon’s Shipyard is thought to have claimed several lives, though yard officials claim the damage is negligible. Other sources have shared images of a smoking crater where maintenance facilities used to be.

1102-270 Jehun/Sabine: The Duchy of Sabine has roundly condemned the actions of a task force from the Duchy of Inara, which entered the Jehun system and routed a force of privateers. A spokesperson from Sabine dismissed Inaran claims that the privateers were those who previously kidnapped nobles from Hessel and were operating from a base in Jehun. In turn, Inara has issued a statement that the Duchy of Sabine is either harbouring pirates or turning a blind eye to their activities when it suits the duke’s purposes and that if Sabine will not take action then others will.

EARLY EXPLORATION

AND SETTLEMENT The earliest serious attempt to chart and survey all of Deneb sector began in year 60, although Scout Service vessels had made sweeps much earlier and venturesome traders were pushing though the sector long before official charts were published. The early mapping missions suffered from a disjointed and contradictory brief, the result of pressure from different groups who all wanted different data. The scouts were under pressure to push out rapidly to find resource-rich worlds for exploitation but also to create detailed surveys of each system as they progressed methodically through the sector. Some agencies wanted to know about potential threats, while others were eager to develop the ‘big picture’ of what lay beyond the Great Rift and pushed for long-range exploration at the expense of detail.

Early explorers also came under threat from corsairs and non-human enclaves which were not always friendly, but nevertheless settlement took place and trade routes were forced through to the new colonies. Resource-rich worlds were targeted for heavy investment by megacorporations, whilst other groups grabbed what land they could in a semi-regulated rush. Later settlement was much more orderly but this was the early days of the new Third Imperium; lessons were still being learned and there was an almost amateurish excitement about the opening of a new region.

In year 34, long before the detailed survey of the sector began, Imperial scouts made contact with the Lidash League, a small state descended from Vilani colonists around Deneb. The League had possessed jump drive technology for some time but was under near-constant attack from corsairs and raiders when not fending off attempts at conquest from nearby Vargr states. In return for a small fleet of obsolescent warships, the Imperium gained an ally in the region and in year 100 the League’s member worlds joined the Imperium as they crushed local opposition, improved their own security and not coincidentally made Imperial expansion into the sector much safer. In these early actions can be seen a precursor of the modern dukes’ machinations – although the Imperium provided the ships, it was the Lagash League that bore the cost of campaigns against the local Vargr states, with the Imperium quietly moving into the power vacuum created.

Not all Vargr states of Deneb were hostile. The Atsak Federation was incorporated almost bloodlessly by a combination of diplomacy and blatant display of strength; the Federation was at the time in a state of near-collapse, which was exploited by the Imperial ambassador in a very devious manner. The results of

this negotiation have caused problems for the Imperium ever since, as local worlds did not join the Imperium as members under the normal system. Instead, their leaders swore allegiance to the newly appointed duke as their overlord – but in his capacity as leader, not an Imperial representative. Today, these worlds have an unusual status as client states of the Imperium, located within the Imperium and loyal to an Imperial noble but not directly tied to the Imperium.

Settlement of the sector took place between years 80 and 250 or so, spreading spinward from Corridor and outward from major colonies set up on resource-rich or habitable worlds. Incorporation into the Imperium was immediate for some worlds but some did not join until the 400s.
The local Vargr states proved to be a major obstacle to expansion, resulting in a series of military operations known as the Vargr Campaigns, starting in the 220s.

In addition to naval operations, the Imperium deliberately targeted some areas for enhanced colonization, attempting to create lasting security by creating strong and stable enclaves that could pacify surrounding systems. One of these was the world of Vincennes, which was placed under the governance of the Humbolt family.

The Humbolts were Imperial nobles of Solomani descent, with a track record for competence and intelligent leadership. They were, according to most accounts, out of favour at the time and requested to be assigned to Vincennes as part of a deal whereby they avoided censure for some failure or perhaps implication in a plot against the Emperor. Other versions of the story claim the Humbolts were clear-eyed heroes who went into what was effectively exile because it was in the best interests of the Imperium that they secure Deneb sector. There are also some distinctly whacky conspiracy theories about ancient artefacts, psionic knights and a centuries-long masterplan on the part of the Humbolts, the Emperor or both.

Whatever the reasons, the Humbolt family came to Vincennes with a great deal of capital to invest and quickly led the world into an explosion of economic and technological progress. They were sufficiently powerful that whole worlds could be assigned to a particular function – the HRD system derives its name form Humbolt Research Division and was a cornerstone of their early success.

While the Humbolts were pacifying the area around Vincennes, ensuring the way was open for expansion into the Spinward Marches, the nearby Pretoria subsector was targeted by megacorporate interests. At the time of its incorporation into the Imperium, Pretoria already had extensive shipyards fuelled by the industry of resource-

rich worlds. Imperial territory in Deneb reached its current extent in the mid 500s, and development continued at a slower pace thereafter. Many of the sector’s worlds
‘missed the boat’ in this early expansion and, as a result, never received significant investment. These worlds generally remain backwaters to this day. Indeed, there is a general acceptance that if a world had not achieved prominence by the outbreak of the Civil War, it never will.

THE CIVIL WAR ERA The First Frontier War, which ran from 589 to 604, was brought to a successful conclusion by Admiral Olav Hault-Plankwell, commander of the Spinward Marches Fleet, despite a lack of assistance from the rest of the Imperium. Immediately afterward, he brought his fleet to Deneb’s naval depot and began to rally support for a drive on Capital. Elements of the Deneb fleet supported him, although it is not clear how fully understood his intentions were at the time.

Arriving at Capital, Plankwell demanded an audience with Empress Jaqueline and personally killed her, assuming the Iridium Throne as the first of the Emperors of the Flag. His reign was short-lived and he was followed by a succession of fleet commanders and high nobles who claimed the throne by right of fleet control or assassination, only to be eliminated in turn.

Amid the chaos of the Civil War, the Second Frontier War erupted in the Spinward Marches, drawing the

Deneb fleet away to support the weak forces left by Plankwell. Ultimately, this was enough and under the command of the new Grand Admiral of the Spinward Marches, Arbellatra, the combined fleet returned in triumph to Deneb. From there, Arbellatra headed for Capital but chose a different path to her predecessors.
Rather than claiming the throne, she defeated all claimants and declared her willingness to act as regent until a suitable candidate could be agreed upon by the Imperial Moot. Perhaps as she had intended all along, Arbellatra was named Empress by the Moot in 629.

In the meantime, the situation in Deneb was chaotic.
The gravely weakened fleet could not prevent Vargr raids from causing immense damage deep into the sector.
Powerful worlds with their own defensive squadrons were safe enough but those lacking fleets of their own suffered raids that went uncountered for years. During this time, Deneb underwent its own miniature version of the Imperial civil war.

The conflict had multiple causes, including attempts by some subsector dukes to become sector duke, factional differences caused by support or opposition to Plankwell, Arbellatra or other Imperial claimants, and resentment over worlds left defenceless by fleet movements. There were several factions, creating a complex situation where alliances suddenly broke down and shocking betrayals were undertaken.

However, the good war quickly turned bad, with attacks on economic centres, shipyards and starports intended to weaken other factions. An alliance between Vincennes and Inar was countered by the other factions putting aside their differences to align against them. With more than half the Deneb fleet headed spinward to defend the Imperium against invasion, the remainder was drawn into ever more vicious fighting in its home sector.

The ‘bad war’ came to an end in 622, when the newly appointed regent Arbellatra ordered the fleets of the warring factions in Deneb to stand down. Most did, returning to base and eventually being reintegrated into the Imperial fleet. Some refused to accept the regent, however. Among them were the Humbolt family, Dukes of Vincennes and at one point almost rulers of the entire Deneb sector. The Humbolts were eventually chased down and their fleet destroyed in 628, although there are those who claim that the last stand was in fact a clever ruse. If so, the fleet and senior members of the Humbolt family were sacrificed to give the Imperium a clear target whilst other assets were hidden. Whatever the truth of this, all family members and high-ranking retainers who could be found were exiled from the Imperium. Their current whereabouts are unknown.

THE POST-WAR ERA Reconstruction after the end of hostilities was rapid and helped return stability to the region. This was a severe necessity, since an unstable Deneb imperiled the Spinward Marches. Lavish investment and genuine attempts to address grievances did much to heal the wounds inflicted in the bad war but there are those who still bear grudges to this day.

In the two centuries after the end of the Civil War, no less than six Imperial research stations were created in Deneb. Among the fields of study were psionic phenomena and techniques, but by the late 700s psionics were viewed with grave suspicion and the research stations redirected their efforts. The Psionics Suppressions closed down all overt psionic research, although some of the institutes went underground and may have survived in some form.

Economic and technological development has continued, with long-established major worlds of the sector increasing in power and the backwaters left ever further behind. This has resulted in resentment and unrest but the grumbling of minor world governments can be safely ignored by those who wield power, at least most of the time. When one of the sector’s major players begins giving the minor worlds what they want, others take notice.

Political Gambits: Letters of Marque and Reprisal Letters of marque and reprisal are a useful tool in the arsenal of an ambitious noble but must be used with care. A letter of marque and reprisal authorises a starship to act as a privateer, attacking targets specified in its remit. Privateers are also permitted to hire out as escorts to protect other vessels or collect a ‘safe passage toll’ from certain ship operators.

A letter of marque and reprisal can protect a ship’s crew from being treated as pirates if caught, although only if they remain within its terms and do not break Imperial High Law – for example by murdering the crew of a surrendered vessel. Some letters specify targets, others particular localities such as a certain main or cluster. For example, a letter of marque and reprisal may permit privateers to attack shipping in a particular system but require them to protect or at least leave unmolested ships registered at certain ports.

An equivalent license is sometimes granted to planetside forces, permitting them to act against particular groups or a world government. In theory, such a force can legitimately raid the target’s assets – including banks and cargo depots – for profit without being declared criminals. If caught, personnel acting under a letter of marque should be treated as combatants in a legitimate conflict and are protected by the threat of reprisals by the letter’s issuer. Whether this is respected by the captors depends a lot on circumstances.

Letters of marque and reprisal are normally issued to further the noble’s own agenda, usually by permitting independents to harass the opponent at their own expense. Sometimes the issuer requires a percentage of any profits and sometimes a letter of marque will be sold as a business venture.
Exploiting conflict to make money this way is seen as unethical by some nobles but by no means all.

The landgrabs and powerplays began in 613, at the height of the Civil War. At first the conflict was almost polite, with justifications for every action and statements of regret about necessity or blame being directed at others. Conventions of civilised warfare were respected and the early phase of the conflict is generally thought of as being a ‘good war’ – one in which the damage is limited and combatants try to behave decently.

Usually this comes to nothing; a backwater world that shifts allegiance and receives investment as a reward is not going to change the balance of power overnight.
Occasionally, however, a minor player manages to obtain meaningful concessions by the right gambit at the right time. This is the great hope of most backwater planetary governments; to benefit from the powerplays of the dukes without attracting a backlash.

DENEB TODAY Deneb is today renowned as a centre for innovation and exploration. It is home to the Jumpspace Institute, known throughout the Imperium as an innovator in starship propulsion technologies, and during the sector’s formative years, the Institute was a sponsor of major exploratory efforts into neighboring sectors. Also based in the sector is the Sklar Astrophysical Society.

In addition there are six Imperial Research Stations. Few sectors can boast of similar dedication to research and development, nor such diversity. The Denebian stations pursue a wide range of activities, from experiments in theoretical physics to undersea geological studies.

Another key characteristic is in government itself; there is no sector duke. Megacorporate interests prefer Deneb to be relatively independent of the Imperial hierarchy and the Imperial Navy finds it easier to deal with Deneb as a collection of subsectors rather than a united sector.
The Emperor sees potential disruption in a united Deneb; there is much truth in this, although it is also a habitual mindset derived from the region’s difficult past.

The region beyond Corridor – Deneb and the Spinward Marches – are sufficiently isolated that a powerful leader might find a secure base there, with a rebellion or even grab for the Imperial throne difficult to nip in the bud.
This is not paranoia; it has happened in the past. It thus suits the Emperor to keep Deneb from becoming united, as several dukes scheming against one another is a lesser evil than one duke deciding to take a unified sector out of the Imperium.

The navy’s high command agrees with this policy. Case Blue 4408 is a nightmare scenario used in strategic planning, whereby a hypothetical Duke of Deneb declares independence and deploys naval forces to block the narrow approach through Corridor. The Imperial Navy could break through but the cost would be high.
Even without a single leader in Deneb, naval intelligence routinely watches warship redeployments for a buildup at the trailing end of the sector. Current planning is for a rapid-response force to seize key worlds in the region at the first hint of large-scale trouble, acting as a wedge to keep the door from being slammed in the navy’s face.

Astute observers gauge the Emperor’s concerns about events in Deneb by the movements of heavy squadrons in Corridor. A large-scale exercise near the spinward end of the sector usually indicates something serious is unfolding in Deneb.

The subsector dukes and other great nobility of Deneb are often – in some cases constantly – at odds. Normally this is restricted to economic sanctions or cut-throat business practices, manipulation of voting blocks in the Imperial Moot and occasional rabble-rousing. Support of rebels and interference in attempts to put down dissent are more common than in other areas, leading to a situation where local conflicts have become proxy wars between the great nobility.

Direct large-scale conflict is fairly rare, as it attracts Imperial displeasure, and trade wars and armed clashes are accepted by the Imperium up to a point – better a short war and negotiated resolution than a dispute running for decades. The sector’s great nobles must use their own forces to fight these conflicts; the Imperial armed forces receive political direction from the nobility but are not directly commanded and, in any case, are loyal to the Imperium, not subsector nobility.

This does not stop the Dukes of Deneb trying to make use of the Imperial forces. Direct orders to go and attack a neighboring subsector are illegal and will be refused

- and might result in a duke being removed from his

position. However, some dukes are skilled at putting the forces assigned to their subsector in a position where they have to go along with the duke’s plans.
Measures range from deception (faked intelligence, false-flag attacks and so forth) to innocuous requests to put a warship where the duke knows something is about to happen.

When open conflict occurs, Imperial forces attempt to remain neutral. This often puts commanders in the frustrating position of watching a clash whilst repeating endless requests for calm and restraint. These are politely ignored by both factions... who of course will also be loudly protesting the actions of the other side and demanding the navy stop standing idly by and actually do something about the heinous villainy of the opposing faction.

Many medals have been won under difficult circumstances in Deneb; warships shepherding crippled vessels out of a fight, firing only in self-defence despite extreme provocation, or peacekeepers under fire from both sides yet bound by orders not to retaliate unless specific and provably deliberate actions are taken against them. Careers have also been wrecked by split-
second decisions that seemed correct at the time.

Service in Deneb is unpopular, not least because any senior commander is likely to be at odds with his subsector nobility from the day he is appointed. ‘Playing the navy’ is a skill most of the nobility possess and yet naval officers are expected to be polite and respectful to the nobles they know are using them.

Even if Imperial forces can be tricked or coerced into helping a duke fight his neigbours, most conflicts fall upon the household forces of the nobles themselves.
Deneb’s great nobility has more warships per capita than any other sector except perhaps Core. These ships tend to be small compared to the vessels of the Imperial Navy but their crews are often very experienced – indeed, navy veterans are actively recruited into household forces, usually at a higher rank than they left the Imperial forces with or at least a better salary.

When open conflict takes place, the Imperium takes action for any Rules of War violations but otherwise remains neutral. Many of the sector’s nobles are in a continual state of cold war with each other, with occasional skirmishing. Mercenary groups of all types are contracted by multiple parties and corporations are often induced to pick sides. At the same time, no one dares attack an Imperial Navy base and no one interferes with, obstructs or provokes Imperial fleets without suffering severe consequences.

THE IMPERIUM Most of Deneb is Imperial territory and administered in the same way as other regions. The Imperium does not directly rule worlds, although special considerations apply where a planet or whole star system is Imperial territory. In these cases, those worlds with a large population have a government like any other inhabited planet, although it is answerable to the Imperium.
Other ‘Imperial Worlds’ and smaller Imperial territories, such as a major naval base, are treated as installations rather than member worlds, with governance provided by the service using the base or a civilian administration operating on behalf of the population and service. These administrators are usually provided by the Imperial Bureaucracy and such territories are generally places where people go to work for a few years at a time rather than homelands.

A few institutions exist at the Imperium-wide level.
These include the standard calendar, services such as the Ministry of Justice and Imperial Navy, and the Imperial High Laws. The Imperium reserves the right to conduct foreign policy at the Imperium-wide level, although powers are granted to local officials to do as necessary without waiting months for directives from Capital. Thus, a subsector duke in Deneb cannot declare war on the Zhodani Consulate, as this is an Imperium-

wide decision but some officials are granted specific powers to deal with issues outside the borders as necessary.

DUCAL POWERS

AND PRIVILEGES The great nobility of the Imperium are expected to deal with problems occurring in their own area of interest and are generally empowered to do so in whatever manner they think most suitable so long as they do not exceed their remit or break Imperial High Law. Each duke has powers appropriate to his station and location of his territory.

Thus, the Duke of Pretoria is empowered to conduct local foreign policy with Vargr worlds and states just beyond the Imperial border, up to and including the use of military force. He can negotiate treaties, make or cancel major trade deals, grant passage to foreign merchant ships or even warships... but he must be ever mindful that he answers to the Emperor for every decision. Too many small errors or one catastrophe can result in a duke being deposed and replaced by someone more competent. Politics in Deneb are such that some subsector dukes are actively working on schemes to cause just such a disaster for their neighbors.

Devolved powers of this sort are granted to those who make a case for needing them or in many cases come with the position. These ‘standing’ powers can be revoked at the Emperor’s decision but normally remain in place for generations after they cease to be needed.
The Imperial Moot has seen many impassioned speeches and closely contested votes over a decision to revoke an ancient power now completely irrelevant, for no better reason than the holder of that power feels like he is losing face by relinquishing it.

Subsector dukes along the border have the power (it is usually called a privilege) to make deals and use force against worlds and states along the borders. Those further away do not usually have this privilege but may petition the Emperor to be given it. At present, for example, representatives from the Duchy of Atsah are conducting a years-long lobbying campaign for their duke to be given Privileges of Foreign Policy regarding the Vargr states to coreward. This is opposed by representatives of the Duchy of Antra, whose duke does not want someone else empowered to send a fleet across the border.

With no sector duke in place, matters that would normally be dealt with at the sector level either devolve to the subsector dukes or default to the standing Imperium-wide position. This has some interesting

consequences. For example, the Duke of Usani is entirely within his rights to negotiate a large-scale trade deal with a Vargr world over the border but the Duke of Atsah could embargo that world using his own powers.
This would not prevent ships from the Duchy of Inar from trading there and the Duke of Inar would normally grant passage to Imperial trade ships – including those from Usani – as a matter of course. However, the Duke of Atsah could make a case for enforcing the embargo, even firing upon or seizing Usani ships.

Normally such a matter would be ruled on by the sector duke but without one the case must go all the way to Capital for adjudication, which is likely to take months or years, on top of transit times. Some inter-duchy issues have been awaiting a decision for decades, either due to complexity or relative importance of other matters. This seems to suit the overall Imperial position; local dukes eventually find some kind of workable solution to their problems and, so long as there is little or no disruption on a wider scale, the endless squabbles of Deneb can be largely ignored.

GOVERNANCE Most of the governance of any sector takes place at a low level. World governments set their own laws, maintain forces for security and local defence, and conduct their own affairs. World governments have some limits on their behaviour but considerable latitude within them. Two worlds can even go to war with one another providing they follow the Imperial Rules of War.
When this happens, the local nobility will normally apply pressure to bring the conflict to a close though this is of course subject to the nobles’ own agenda. Wars of conquest are not permitted; one world cannot conquer another although outposts on remote outsystem moons can, and do, change hands.

Self-governance is ‘internal’. In other words issues that extend beyond a planet’s 100-diameter jump limit are automatically of interest to the Imperium, although for the most part, world governments are left to get on with their own affairs. When a dispute or wider issue breaks out, mediation is offered by the Imperial nobility. There is a clearly defined system in place for who deals with any given issue.

The noble associated with each world in a dispute
(usually a baronet, baron or marquis) sends a delegation

- or occasionally goes personally – to the court of the

next higher multiworld grouping. This is typically a viscount or count if the world is part of a county; if not the matter is dealt with at the subsector duke’s court. If the matter is entirely within a given noble’s remit then

judgement can be issued. If not, there will be further back-and-forth discussion with representatives of the nobles involved until a solution is agreed. Of course, since the nobility do not directly rule worlds, a world government could reject the solution its associated noble has negotiated. This is rare and usually leads to intervention.

Interventions can take the form of warships in the sky and boots on the ground, although far more commonly economic pressure is placed upon the world. Interdiction
(Red Zoning for political reasons) is an extreme way of compelling a world to accept a resolution but it happens from time-to-time. Although worlds are self-governing, the high nobility has the power to force compliance when necessary.

Which subsector duke hears a given world’s petitions is thus of great importance. Those worlds that lie firmly within the boundaries of a duchy normally have little choice but the political situation in Deneb is such that worlds can sometimes choose which duke they will give loyalty to. This tends to anger a duke who has lost the support of a given world, so the ability of the new liege to protect the world from retribution – which might or might not be very subtle – is important when making such a grave choice.

Worlds in subsectors that do not have a duke in place have more choice – or rather, they can choose with less concern about consequences – than those located close to a ducal seat. However, the allegiance of all worlds in Deneb is theoretically up for grabs. Governance over a greater number of worlds gives a duke increased power and influence, and is seen as a worthwhile goal by most players in the sector’s political games. For their part, world governments are very aware that the right choice

The Dukes and the Fleet Major worlds under the control of the subsector dukes build and maintain the vessels of Deneb’s fleet but these fleets have a chain of command terminating with the Emperor, not the local nobility.
They cannot be used for resolving internal, regional, or sector-wide disputes without Imperial approval passed down the proper chain of command, no matter what the subsector duke might have to say on the subject. This is an Imperial law put into effect after the Civil War, where sector autonomy resulted in rapid successions – and assassinations –
of some two dozen emperors.

can benefit them greatly but also know that ultimately they are pawns in the schemes of the great nobility.
Some worlds are extremely loyal and benefit from a close relationship with their duke. Others balance the pros and cons of cooperating with any given great noble. A duke that wants to maintain control over these worlds cannot lose sight of this fact.

OPERATING IN DENEB Businesses, shipping lines and mercenary units must be mindful of the local political conditions when operating in Deneb. An apparently lucrative and low-risk project can be suddenly derailed, putting participants out of business. Conflicts may come to a sudden end or expand greatly, changing the rules of engagement or compromising the participants’
previously secure position.

The political dimension pervades all endeavors. For example, a mercenary unit might be hired to carry out an apparently simple task on a success-only contract, then have to move its schedule to a breakneck pace when peace negotiations break out. Client briefings often include an estimate of the time available before the likely political consequences occur and orders often include a requirement to complete a mission before intervention becomes a possibility. The most successful mercenaries, shipping operators and businesses are adept at forecasting the changeable political weather; those who just hope for the best usually run into trouble.

Who a given company or unit does business with can have serious implications. There might be a good reason why a client is paying high salaries or offering big bonuses; often this is because anyone taking the job can expect never to work again in an entire subsector.
This political dimension can work in favour of operators, of course. If a mercenary unit has no intention of ever working for a particular client then the big payment to take on a job against them – a job nobody else wants

- might be worth it. Likewise, the only shipping line

willing to run goods into a particular system will win friends there and might even be part of changing the political landscape a little.

The results of a decision tend to be important for individuals and companies but small and subtle on the interstellar politics scale. Breaking an embargo will not cause a duchy to collapse and one successful rebellion will not alter the course of history. For all that, those willing to go against the flow have a chance to make a real difference in Deneb – assuming they can survive the consequences of their actions.

POWERS OF DENEB Power is wielded in many different ways and from different sources. The Imperial Navy can cut off a world from outside trade and cripple its economy but a corporation supplying critical components can hamper the navy to the point where its choices are influenced

- openly or otherwise. Likewise, the sector dukes

and great nobility wield enormous power, with world governments, corporations and research centres having lesser or more localised influence.

Any use of power will fall somewhere on the ‘influence-
force continuum’, depending on how open the wielder is willing (or needs) to be. Force is not just military action. A refusal to handle specific tasks by port workers is a use of force in this context – it is a direct and open challenge to those who need the work done.

Money, of course, buys power. Again this can be overt, in the form of warships and mercenary regiments, or it can be much more subtle. A promise of investment can buy the support of a world government; threatening to pull out of a critical project can induce compliance. In this context, corporations, and those members of the nobility that control major business interests, may influence the course of events in the sector more than those with the biggest fleets.

As a general rule, force can be used to obtain a short-
term advantage but influence is required to cement the gains. This might not be the case if the powers of Deneb had free rein to do as they pleased, however they do not. A duke might get away with occupying a couple of worlds under the pretense of dealing with unrest or revolt but attempting to conquer half a neighboring subsector will trigger an Imperial intervention with a politely worded ‘request’ to visit Capital and present an explanation. If the Imperium ever became weak enough that it could not correct a duke who behaved this way –
perhaps distracted by a major war elsewhere or wracked by internal conflict – then the subsector dukes might try direct conquest. For the foreseeable future, however, they play a careful game of political and economic manipulation, with open warfare used as a threat but rarely carried out.

THE IMPERIAL NAVY As with other sectors, the Imperial Navy maintains a three-tier system in Deneb. This consists of the sector fleet, the subsector fleets and the misleadingly named colonial fleet. There is also a reserve of ships that can be recalled or reactivated as needed, although this

force has no command structure of its own. Once ready for service, ships of the reserve would be added to the relevant sector or subsector commands, or formed into new task forces under the command of senior officers assigned by the sector admiral.

The sector fleet, named for the sector, contains all capital ships assigned to the sector and most of the cruisers. Its task is to deal with large-scale threats and to this end the sector fleet is kept concentrated at its main bases, with assets parcelled out to local commands, as necessary, or detached to deal with major incidents. The sector fleet is a peacetime administrative apparatus. In wartime, additional fleets with specific designations are usually formed (such as battle fleets or strike fleets) using assets detached from the sector fleet, with the sector fleet itself remaining as a reserve and defensive asset for its home sector.

In addition to protecting Deneb from incursions by major Vargr forces from coreward, the Deneb fleet acts as a strategic reserve for the Spinward Marches. In the event of an attack by the Zhodani Consulate or some other power, heavy squadrons would be dispatched to reinforce the Spinward Marches fleet or formed into a battle fleet to deliver a powerful counterattack.
Meanwhile, additional forces would be expected to move up from Corridor and the Imperial heartland. This would inevitably take many weeks however, so the forces of the Spinward Marches and Deneb would have to hold the line until reinforcements arrived.

At any given time, some elements of the sector fleet are absent from their bases, on joint exercises in the Spinward Marches or reminding the worlds along the frontier of the power and strength of the Imperium; a squadron of battleships or heavy cruisers on a goodwill visit makes a powerful statement but one that must be repeated from time-to-time. Other heavy units might be on internal deployment, visiting major worlds to show the flag and remind subsector dukes that their powerbase is insignificant compared to that of the Imperium itself. Smaller ships, in the destroyer and escort classes for the most part, will be out on patrol augmenting the strength of the subsector fleets.

Whilst the sector fleet is tasked with warfighting and deterring large-scale conflict, the subsector fleets are charged with keeping the peace and protecting commerce on the spacelanes. Most subsector fleets have one or, at most, two vessels in the cruiser or light carrier class as flagships, with most other vessels in the destroyer or escort class. These ships tend to be scattered all over the subsector on solo patrol or in small task forces, maintaining a constant armed

presence on the spacelanes. Transit times to and from patrol stations, along with the need to conduct training and maintenance, mean that only a proportion of the subsector fleet is on-station at any given time, with a relatively small reserve of vessels ready at their bases to respond to a crisis. However, incidents too serious for a subsector fleet destroyer or escort squadron to deal with are rare and support is always available from the sector fleet’s assets.

Where the sector fleet’s commanders stand aloof from the politics of their local area, subsector fleets are subject to much stronger influence from their subsector duke. Some subsector fleets in Deneb are more or less in the pocket of the local duke, which in turn allows the sector command to be manipulated by way of requests coming up the chain of command.

The so-called colonial fleet (an archaic term from the early days of the Imperium) is a command structure overseeing all contributed forces that can be called upon to assist the sector or subsector fleets. These include the personal forces of nobles and planetary navies that include jump-capable vessels, experimental ships stationed at bases or research installations, escort ships operated by merchant lines, mercenary vessels on contract to the sector or subsector command, and any independents who have been co-opted. The latter often includes small merchant ships that receive a reserve auxiliary stipend, allowing the navy to call them to service as support craft and logistics assets. Scout Service ships are sometimes loaned to the colonial fleet to assist with naval operations.

Not all vessels of these types are part of the colonial fleet. Indeed, many nobles and world governments prefer to keep their warships private and not subject to orders from fleet commanders. Others ‘keep a spare hat’, as the saying goes, and pass in and out of colonial fleet service as the need arises. Although colonial fleet ships tend to be older or cheaper (in other words less effective) designs and their crews may not be trained to the standard of the Imperial Navy, they provide a useful resource to cover more patrol stations.

A vessel in colonial fleet service has a navy transponder code, and the full authority of the fleet, but is also subject to its rules, regulations and chain of command.
It can thus be important to observe which hat a captain is wearing, so to speak. A vessel in private hands can go places and do things that one whose captain is wearing his navy hat cannot.

The Imperial Navy’s main base in Deneb sector is at Depot, in a star system formerly known as Sika’im.

The Inar subsector was chosen for its central location, positioning fleet assets and facilities where they could react quickly to an incursion but far enough from the border to make surprise attack unlikely. Despite the best efforts of the subsector dukes – particularly Inar – the sector fleet consciously maintains its distance from the nobility of the region, not least since it is the duty of the sector admiral to send his fleet against a duke who steps too far out of line. If a limited war heats up to the point that a duke considers using tactical nuclear or biological weapons, or he attempts outright annexation of worlds, the navy is expected to bring matters to an abrupt close.

THE DUKES The Imperial nobility does not directly rule worlds, except where a noble is also the head of the world government. Nor do the great nobility rule clusters of star systems or subsectors, as such. The nobility –
officially at least – administers its territory on behalf of the Emperor and handles some aspects of governance on behalf of the worlds in its care. Thus a subsector duke is responsible for dispute resolution within his area of influence and deals with what might be termed foreign policy on behalf of his subsector. ‘Foreign’ in this case can mean the next subsector over, which will also be Imperial territory.

The duke will also provide direction to the Imperial armed forces in his subsector, suggesting which trouble spots should receive additional patrols and authorising military action against factions damaging to the stability of the subsector. The ideal is that the great nobility provides leadership and sees the big picture where a world government is more likely to concentrate on its own affairs. This ideal assumes the great nobility pursue the best interests of the worlds within their territory but the reality is that the Dukes of Deneb put their own position and agenda ahead of the well-being of their people.

The dukes and other high nobility are extremely wealthy and powerful, usually with business interests on many worlds as well as their own personal armed forces and privately owned territory. These assets are directly controlled by the nobles and can be used as they see fit, subject to restrictions imposed by Imperial High Law. A duke or other high noble can be stripped of their position but most of the great nobility come from old families who have held their positions for centuries.

Although dukes officially administer and lead, rather than rule, in practice the distinction can be hard to see. A subsector duke has sufficient influence that he can make life very difficult for a person, corporation or

government that does not obey his orders. There may be no legal requirement to do as the duke says but it is an open secret that those who do not obey will find their contracts dry up and business collapses even if they do not face direct censure.

The ability of any given subsector duke to control his territory depends on his degree of power and influence

- strength creates more strength, by giving the duke the

means to harm those who do not obey him. Naturally, opponents will try to undermine the strength of a duke’s influence in the hope of rendering him ineffectual – if corporation A feels it can ignore instructions to cut off trade with world B, the subsector duke cannot use this as a threat to force compliance. That in turn might cost him control over research installation C, based on world B, since the world government can no longer be coerced into applying sanctions to the research facility.

The subsector dukes, and other great nobility of the sector, know this well and are constantly watchful for challenges to their position. They know their power can be slowly chipped away, as well as catastrophically smashed in head-on confrontation, and they know they can do the same to their rivals. With no sector duke in overall control, each subsector duke makes his own policies. Maintaining position and increasing power is high on that agenda, as is weakening rivals.

Control over the sector’s major worlds is the key to power in Deneb. Proximity is a factor, since a duke finds it easier to influence worlds that lie within his official area of responsibility. The subsector duke has control of ‘Imperial money’, a loose term for the assistance –
most of it in fact non-financial but all paid for from the Imperial coffers – given to worlds by the Imperium. A good assistance package can improve a world’s future; refusing one or ensuring assistance is inadequate or inappropriate can cripple an economy. This is a potent tool in controlling local worlds but a subsector duke cannot direct Imperial money to worlds outside his remit

- at least not directly.

Control over more distant worlds is achieved by indirect means such as trade or industrial dependencies, creating businesses or straightforward bribery. Some dukes prefer intimidation, others work hard to earn the loyalty of their subordinates and those whose allegiance they want. The ultimate goal is to eclipse all other subsector dukes and become the senior noble in the sector. The title Duke of Deneb is within reach for at least some of the subsector dukes and they all want to ensure nobody else is given it.

THE EIGHT DUCHIES Each of Deneb’s eight duchies is different, with local influences on its policies and practices. All have their own forces loyal to the duke and his family, and a large administrative staff who handle the affairs of the duchy.
These assets are augmented mercenaries or freelancers as necessary. This is sometimes done to conceal the duke’s involvement in an action but often the allegiance of freelancers is openly declared. Some mercenary units have been on contract to a duke for so long they have become a symbol of the duchy but, more commonly, assets are hired and fired as needed.

### The Duchy of Pretoria

The Duchy of Pretoria lies on the Imperial border and must contend with Vargr raids coming from coreward as well as by way of the Aramis Trace, a cluster of star systems close to the Imperial border in the neighboring Aramis subsector. The duke’s personal forces are sometimes sent into Aramis – not always with the blessing of its nobility –
to deal with corsair bases or block well-used routes. The Pretoria subsector fleet cannot operate outside its home area without special permission but ducal forces are not subject to such restrictions.

The Duke of Pretoria is generally more concerned with the security of his borders than attempting to gain more power in Deneb, yet is concerned with such efforts on the part of others. He typically acts in co-operation with the Duke of Sabine, while affairs along the Aramis Trace are handled by Count Urnas.

Pretoria maintains a large ducal fleet by the standards of the Imperium. Most vessels are what might be termed ‘corsair-killers’, lightly protected but with heavy firepower for their size. The majority are small and of little value in battle with major warships. However, since the average corsair is a converted merchant ship or an escort-sized warship this is not a drawback. The fleet includes two obsolescent cruisers that are used to show the duke’s flag across the border in Vargr space, along with a very old, but still capable, battleship. This vessel is often assigned to the subsector’s colonial fleet but sometimes serves as a mobile ducal residence. The phrase ‘like the Duke’s yacht’ is a common colloquialism

in Pretoria subsector, denoting something far too big, powerful or expensive for its purpose.

The Duchy of Antra The Duchy of Antra is in a weak position and has been so for a very long time, in part due to the machinations of Inar and Atsah, who undermine the Duke of Antra’s position at every turn. The problem is compounded by Vargr incursions across the border, which keep the subsector fleet busy. It is an open secret that Antra pays corsairs to stay out of its territory, which improves the security situation at the price of making the duke look even weaker than he is.

The Duke of Antra is particularly hostile to Inar, a result of a long history of blatant actions against Antra by Inar.
By way of retaliation, Antra has taken to granting letters of marque and reprisal to corsairs and even pardoning captured raiders in return for an agreement to act against Inar. In this, the duke is sailing very close to the wind. Not only does he risk Imperial displeasure if ‘his’
corsairs are deemed to be pirates rather than legitimate privateers but his actions risk a naval response from Inar, which will almost certainly ignite a shooting war.

Antra’s ducal fleet favours multirole vessels, with room for a troop contingent aboard or to carry stores for disaster relief. Whilst this reduces the fleet’s ship-for-ship fighting power it enables a flexible response to be made in many situations and ships with generous accommodation or the ability to carry a lot of supplies can stay on station for longer than vessels with more ‘teeth’.

The Duchy of Sabine Lying to rimward of Pretoria, the Duchy of Sabine does not have an external frontier and can concentrate more fully on internal matters, which typically means power struggles with Inar and Vincennes. Relations with Pretoria, and with Rhylanor and Mora in the Spinward Marches, are generally cooperative.

Sabine’s position is hampered by dissent between the ducal seat at Magash and the military centre at Thengin.
Nearby world governments align themselves according to conditions – if there is a military threat then Thengin is suddenly more attractive but otherwise most governments follow the general lead of the Duke at Magash.

Sabine’s ducal fleet favours a smaller number of destroyer-sized vessels over escorts. Ships are well-
maintained and their crews highly trained by ex-Imperial Navy personnel hired as instructors. It is generally supposed that Sabine hopes to offset the technological superiority of Vincennes by investing in its people.

### MAP OF THE

### DUCHIES AND

### THEIR AREAS

### OF CONTROL

The Duchy of Inar Inar is the most powerful of Deneb’s duchies, although the complexities of interstellar politics make it difficult to state an exact ratio. However, it is commonly accepted that Inar wields at least as much influence as the duchies of Atsah and Vincennes combined. Warships and regiments are easier to count and here again Inar can field at least twice the tonnage and numbers of its nearest rival. Raw figures do not necessarily translate to fighting power but the ability of Inar to show the flag in more places at once contributes greatly to its impact on the affairs of the sector.

Inar shares a border with Vincennes, which is characterised by endless manoeuvring for position. In the past, these two powers were briefly allied but today their relationship is adversarial at best.

The ducal fleet contains a handful of cruisers supported by a large number of smaller vessels. As is typical of naval forces in private service, these vessels are mostly of older design but the Duke of Inar seems to have obtained two up-to-date Amara -class heavy cruisers.
These are shown off at every opportunity, often operating together or at the centre of a task force including light carriers as well. Inar’s ducal fleet actually outguns the local subsector fleet, although a confrontation is highly unlikely.

The Duchy of Atsah Atsah has strong trade links with Corridor and the Imperial heartland beyond, and gets first pick of goods coming into Deneb from that direction. This gives the duke considerable extra leverage, on top of an already powerful domestic position, and Atsah more or less dominates the Million subsector to coreward and can prevent rivals running trade convoys around Atsah’s territory if it chooses to do so. Influence over the Dunmag subsector is less but still considerable.

One consequence of this is that whilst the Duke of Atsah has a very considerable private navy, it is stretched thin.
Like Pretoria, Atsah cannot use the Imperial subsector fleet to pursue its own agenda – although sometimes the fleet’s commanders can be prevailed upon to assist Imperial forces in Million or Dunmag, and the duke makes sure he gets credit. Ducal forces spend a lot of their time dispersed on flag-showing missions or being seen to deal with local problems that the Imperial fleet and the other dukes have taken no notice of.

Atsah’s primary naval assets are converted destroyers, most of which have had their armament reduced in favour of improved accommodation for increased time on station. These ships routinely undertake very long deployments, sweeping through several systems or accompanying large freighters, liners or convoys of smaller ships as they pass through surrounding subsectors. Maintenance of these ships tends to be skimpy due to their constant deployment but a can-do attitude prevails among their crews.

The Duchy of Vincennes Vincennes, the ducal seat of the Vincennes subsector, is one of the single most powerful worlds in the Imperium, wielding twice the economic, industrial and military might of Starn, the next most powerful world in Deneb.
The availability of TL16 goods allows the Duke of Vincennes to reward his supporters or weaken those relying upon equipment supplied and maintained by Vincennes. This high-tech carrot-and-stick approach works well but occasionally damages exports as end clients are reluctant to buy goods that might not be supported when they come to order spares.

Political Gambits: Routiers Most mercenary forces are properly licensed, professional and reasonably reliable. They tend to have an eye to the future, aware that a unit’s reputation determines where the next job comes from and how grim it might be. Units with a good reputation command a high fee and pick their jobs.
Those without a track record may have to take whatever work they can get. This can lead to being fed into a meatgrinder by unscrupulous clients or used to undertake distasteful tasks. The nobility of Deneb make use of mercenaries on a regular basis and will pay premium prices to keep a particularly good unit out of someone else’s service.

However, some will use mercenaries for a slightly different purpose. The term ‘routier’, originating on old Terra, has connotations of unreliability and low quality in Deneb. Mercenaries of this sort are sometimes hired for an ostensibly valid task –
such as protecting aid workers on a nearby world

- and then suddenly paid off due to ‘changing

requirements’. This dumps large numbers of poorly trained, armed and often criminally inclined men and women into the local equation, with the result that at least some will turn to crime and banditry in order to make a living and get offworld.

The ‘routier gambit’ is an effective and low-cost way of destabilizing an area and causing trouble for the opposition. Often, the local authorities will have no option but to hire some of the routiers to fight their former comrades, with predictably poor results.

The Duke of Vincennes has what might be termed as a robust policy regarding the affairs of his subsector and its surroundings. The duchy tries to have at least one finger in every conceivable pie and is not afraid to make an example of a world or faction that opposes it. This is particularly true for those who shift their support to the neighboring Duchy of Inar.

The Vincennes ducal fleet is a mix of standard and custom vessels, with many otherwise standard designs augmented with a TL16 components. Experimental ships or vessels acting as testbeds for emerging technologies are not uncommon, with the ducal fleet more than willing to try its advanced systems in combat.

### The Duchy of Usani

Although it contains the sector capital, Deneb, the Duchy of Usani is politically and economically weak. Its astrographical position, on the shore of the Great Rift, is in some ways an advantage – there is little to worry about in that direction – but it does limit trade from the Imperial heartland. Goods from trailing arrive by way of shipping from Dunmag as a result of the sparsity of worlds in the rimward end of Atsah. The combination of a three-parsec gap and manipulation of trade by the Duchy of Atsah pinches off the flow of commerce from this direction.

As much as possible, Usani prefers to ally with the Duke of Inar against Vincennes. However, its weak position means its stance must shift from time-to-time. Relations with other duchies can vary considerably, with Usani doing what it has to rather than purely acting in its own best interests.

The Usani ducal fleet contains few warships, mostly small escorts, although it does operate a number of armed merchant cruisers and merchant carriers. These vessels are well suited to commerce protection – and some would say also to raiding the commerce of other subsectors – but would not stand up to a major warship.
However, their ability to carry cargo whilst maintaining a deterrent presence on the spacelanes makes having a fleet of sorts attainable to the cash-strapped duchy.

### The Duchy of Zeng

The Duchy of Zeng is in a similar astrographical position to Usani but benefits from good relations with Trin in the Spinward Marches. Trin is not a competitor for the title of Sector Duke of Deneb, for obvious reasons, so deals with Zeng in straight economic-benefit terms.
The concentration of most of the duchy’s worlds into a central cluster also has significant advantages in terms of trade and political influence.

Zeng is highly influential in the Gulf subsector and officially administers the handful of systems in Macon.
The duchy is seen as ‘not really a player’ in the great game of dominance over Deneb. Lying out on the fringes and distant from the sector’s politics in more than just astrographical terms, Zeng is not perceived as a threat by the other duchies and thus enjoys better relations than most others. It generally cooperates with Usani and Atsah, and has a neutral position towards the other duchies most of the time.

Zeng’s ducal fleet is typical, with a single old cruiser as flagship and a handful of destroyers of varying designs, supported by a much larger number of escorts and patrol vessels. Most of the time these ships are seconded to the colonial fleet and serve as commerce protection assets with the Imperial Navy.

CORPORATIONS All of the Imperial megacorporations have interests in Deneb, just to varying degrees. The megacorporations produce such a variety of goods, and handle such huge volumes of trade in items, information and financial assets, that their influence can be felt almost anywhere.
On any given world, at least some of the goods in the shops have been produced in megacorporate-owned factories or transported on ships built or operated by the megacorporations. In many cases, starports have been built with megacorporate money.

At the very least, these huge firms have an interest in keeping markets open and increasing their share

- possibly at the expense of their rivals. Any political

machinations that affect their business will be opposed by the megacorporations to the fullest extent and they have a variety of means at their disposal.
All megacorporations and most larger corporations are associated with noble families that have very considerable influence.

Although their holdings are more dispersed than those of a sector duke, the megacorporations are more powerful in most ways. Their wealth and ability to influence governments through economic pressure are immense.
Megacorporations also have their own ships and security forces – or can hire them on the mercenary market – and are quite willing to use them.

Some megacorporations have major interests in Deneb and can be considered additional players on the political field. Even subsector dukes are wary of a direct clash with megacorporations, with the result that megacorporate vessels will sometimes sail blithely through an armed standoff and industrial enclaves are safe havens even whilst a ground war is raging nearby.

Delgado Delgado directly operates numerous mining operations in Deneb, along with supporting industries such as ore and chemical refining. Its facilities are typically in heavily industrialised systems, notably asteroid and planetoid belts. Whilst not a player in the dominance games of the sector, Delgado is willing to take advantage of the situation wherever it can, quietly buying out a troubled mining outpost then using its corporate near-
invulnerability to turn the fortunes of its new acquisition around. This gambit has backfired a few times but megacorporations can afford to invest where others dare not and Delgardo is exploiting the situation to increase its share of the mining industry in Deneb.

General Products General Products is active in several market sectors, notably heavy industry and starship construction. The latter has suffered lately with a series of poor designs and embarrassing failures, a situation General is keen to reverse. To this end, it has taken to offering basic warships and trade vessels at low prices, resulting in an upsurge in small-scale trading – and occasionally an increase in piracy preying on the abundant shipping.
These vessels are not particularly good but provide an affordable patrol force to a cash-strapped client and can get goods from A to B almost as well as a more expensive ship. General Products does not have a centre of power in Deneb but maintains shipbuilding facilities at several of the region’s better starports.

GSbAG GSbAG is almost exclusively a starship manufacturer, with a reputation for high-quality vessels that command an equally high price. It has no specific centre of power but maintains shipyards at some of the high-end starports in the sector. A showcase facility is planned, at a location yet to be chosen. Naturally, most major worlds of the sector – and all of the duchies – are vying for the lucrative position of host. The facility will produce high-end military vessels for the Imperial Navy as well as yachts and liners for prestige clients.

Hortalez et Cie Hortalez specialises in finance and banking rather than physical goods and has brokerages in most major starports. It is not clear if Hortalez is a player in the political arena or not, due to complex chains of transactions that disguise many of its major dealings.
However, it is obvious that Hortalez et Cie is keen to support any faction that keeps trade lanes open and money flowing. To that end, the megacorporation is thought to be a stabilizing influence, exerting steady pressure for moderation on all factions. Its mediators have assisted in the negotiation of several important peace treaties, favouring fair deals that reduce chance of further conflict.

Instellarms Instellarms produces high-end military hardware, selling to mercenary forces, governments and similar bulk clients. It does not deal in single weapons but in high-volume equipping contracts that include weaponry, ammunition, spares and training. Instellarms supplies many of the better mercenary formations and some subsector dukes with their hardware, on a scrupulously neutral basis. Those with the cash can buy from Instellarms unless the sale would be illegal; a noble under Imperial censure or a mercenary unit with questionable paperwork will be refused a sale but those in good standing do not have to provide a reason for wanting to buy arms.

STANDARD PRODUCTS LIC

SHARURSHID

### Ling Standard Products (LSP)

LSP is mainly active in the mining, industrial and shipbuilding sectors, typically producing mid-range vessels at a reasonable price. LSP has shipyards on a few worlds in Deneb and large mining operations in several systems. A notable concentration exists in Pretoria, which draws LSP into the political arena when Pretoria is threatened by its rivals. In general, LSP has a good relationship with the Duke of Pretoria and has occasionally been loaned a few ducal ships to escort its trans-border trading operations out into the Vargr worlds to coreward.

### Makhidkarun

Makhidkarun produces luxury goods and items of great sophistication such as data processing equipment and robots. It is active all over the sector but maintains a major facility on Vincennes, where the megacorporation develops next-generation communications equipment and robotics. A subsidiary operates some of the most prestigious liners in the sector, which act as travelling showrooms for the very latest in top-end electronics, robotics and luxury goods.

### Naasirka

Naasirka is an electronics giant, unable to compete with Makhidkarun for the top end of the market but dominant at the mid-level and low-end. Naasirka has numerous government contracts, including standard systems for the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service. Naasirka’s public image in Deneb is of straightforward industrialists producing highly useful products for everyone, which is not totally inaccurate. Its spokespeople can be expected to urge calm and restraint to all factions in every conflict that breaks out and the megacorporation is widely known to fund relief operations when the shooting stops.

Naasirka makes no secret of the fact that this is good long-term business – if the lights go black on using Naasirka equipment, then those people will buy Naasirka when it comes to keeping them on. Critics claim that Naasirka is profiting from instability and conflict and the firm typically replies that it is merely adapting to the current business climate.

Schunamann und Sohn, AG LIC (SuSAG)
SuSAG is highly active in the chemical, pharmaceutical and engineering market sectors. Most of its products are commonplace, including many trusted brands, and its engineers have assisted in the constriction of several starports and other major facilities. SuSAG is involved in research into biochemical warfare and, although its PR arm makes much of the ‘defences and protection’ aspect of this activity, the firm does attract bad press. SuSAG makes some of the best hostile environment equipment available but is widely thought to use this as a cover for weapons research. It maintains small research facilities in remote parts of various star systems, heavily guarded and very secretive.

Sharurshid Sharurshid is primarily a shipping operator, although it uses these vessels to facilitate trade in a vast array of goods. Sharurshid is a constant voice for restraint in Deneb and has been known to apply economic pressure to those dukes who allow piracy and disruption of trade to interfere with business. Most of Sharurshid’s vessels are large freighters, plying the lanes right across the sector from one border to the other. It does not favour any candidates for sector duke but does lobby for the appointment of one, as a more unified sector would mean more stable trading conditions. Sharurshid has a major regional office at Deneb, although few of its ships travel there.

S T E R N M E TA L

H O R I Z O N S

Sternmetal Horizons Sternmetal has always been a major player in the mining and manufacturing sectors, and was one of the original heavy investors in the sector. Its power generation and food production equipment is in use on a great many worlds, with the company’s research division finding innovative ways to make otherwise inedible substances palatable and nutritious. Despite aiming for a reputation as ‘the colonist’s friend’ Sternmetal has a reputation for hard-nosed business practices and puts living conditions far below profit on its many mining installations across the sector.

MINOR STATES

AND POWERS Outside the duchies, but within the Imperial border, most worlds are individual members of the Imperium, although some are part of multi-world counties. The nobles who administer these counties have nowhere near the power wielded by an Imperial duke but manage to exert some influence over surrounding systems. There are also individual worlds powerful enough to exert influence. These have nobles assigned to them but it is the world government that holds the power, not the nobles who act as representatives to the Imperium.

Parts of the sector lie outside the Imperium and the attitude of these worlds varies considerably. Some are Imperial client states, either because they wish to be or because the Imperium has made them dependent for strategic reasons. Others change their allegiances.
Many of these worlds are populated primarily or wholly by Vargr and are heavily influenced by the politics of the larger Vargr states to coreward.

There are also a number of powerful entities in the sector that are not states or world governments. Like corporations, these organizations, movements and networks exert influence in many areas and may have enclaves within the territory of a duchy or other major power.

The Humbolts The former Dukes of Vincennes were enormously rich and powerful, enjoying the support of many worlds in the sector. After they chose the losing side in the Civil War, the Humbolts’ power was broken and their assets were seized – all that could be found, anyway. Their fleet was chased down, brought to action and destroyed.
However, it is not possible to say how many members of the family escaped and what they took with them.

Today, the Humbolts are the subject of dozens of conspiracy theories and blamed for all manner of setbacks, problems and outbreaks of unrest. They are also used as a threat to manipulate public opinion –
‘better get this legislation through its democratic review process before the Humbolts finish their sneaky plans to take control over the krill-protein processing industry’.
It is known that some members of the Humbolt family fled beyond the Imperium and some of their supporters funnelled money and hardware to them. It is not clear how many of former allies and supporters were sincere in their conversion to the new order but five centuries have passed. This is long enough for the Humbolts to have carved out an empire somewhere or been wiped out by a string of misfortunes. The situation is obfuscated further by the plethora of ‘false Humbolts’.

Tukera Lines Tukera Lines is a shipping operator, concerned mainly with major trade routes. It has offices on most worlds with a good port and large facilities where trade routes meet. Tukera operates a larger proportion of jump-3 and jump-4 capable vessels than most other shipping firms and has a useful sideline in getting information and people to the right place, fast. Its fast-courier network supplements the Imperial x-boat system but is made available only to those clients favoured by the megacorporation. Tukera openly supports the Duke of Atsah in his bid to become Duke of Deneb.

Zirunkariish Zirunkariish is a financial and investment corporation, with offices at major ports on the main trade routes. It does not deal with minor clients but can put together huge investment packages for those with the resources to afford them. Zirunkariish is hard-nosed in its dealings and has shown itself quite willing to bankroll both sides in a conflict. This actually makes it a force for a sort of stability, as a crushing defeat may prevent a faction from repaying creditors. Zirunkariish is openly profiting from the state of conflict in the region and in more than one way. It provides secure currency transfer and escrow services for major purchases of military hardware, hiring of mercenary forces and so forth. This means that Zirunkariish has to move shiploads of gold, hard currency and other precious items, creating a very attractive target for pirates but mostly it deals in reliable electronic transfers of funds.

These include entirely fictitious allegations that the Humbolts are threatening the stability of the Imperium by measures that must be opposed by following someone’s agenda as well as real groups trying to exploit the Humbolt legend to legitimise their own endeavors.
The conspiracy theorists are adamant that Humbolt agents and high-ranking members of the family are in positions of power across the sector and beyond, and that these ‘false Humbolts’ are actually real.
The premise behind these claims is that it serves the Humbolts’ purposes for everyone to discount rumors of their activities as ‘just another false Humbolt’ and that they are behind every event in the sector.

The reality of the matter is that there are some remnants of the Humbolts’ powerbase in Deneb and they did succeed in establishing enclaves elsewhere. These groups have evolved over time. Some have collapsed and others have left behind the ‘Humbolt legacy’ to pursue other aims. However, there are family members and close allies in Deneb who are working towards someday restoring the family to its lost glory. They are willing to support a cause they believe in, or which furthers their agenda, and may give arms or money to rebels against groups that had a hand in their destruction long ago.

The surviving Humbolts have long memories and an unknown level of power or influence. They cannot possibly be as active as conspiracy theorists like to believe, or else they would have already taken over the sector, but they do have local powerbases and a plan. It is possible this is disrupted by the individual ambitions of these Humbolt successors, who may well be working against one another as well as towards their final goal.

### The Lurent

The Lurent are a minor race native to Borlund but their trade ships are sufficiently widespread that they have become a power of sorts in the sector’s politics.

By the time the Imperium contacted them, the Lurent had reached TL8 and were already outfitting planetoid ships to undertake mining operations in their outsystem and Oort cloud. Trade with the Imperium allowed the Lurent to quickly attain TL9, and soon planetoid ships had been outfitted with jump drives.

Lurent planetoid vessels are typically enormous, being mobile bases rather than starships. A given vessel may have a population in the tens of millions, including non-
Lurent. Rather than proceeding directly to a mainworld, these wandering planetoid colonies usually emerge near a star system’s Oort cloud, to refuel and negotiate trade agreements with potential clients. Trade is undertaken

by sublight craft, although sometimes conventional jump-capable ships are used for in-system transits.

In some systems, especially those with very bright stars, the Lurent may remain in the outsystem for the duration of their stay. Elsewhere, their gigantic ship will slowly spiral inward, eventually taking up orbit around one of the system’s major planets. The Lurent rarely seem to be in a hurry; a planetoid ship might spend years in a system’s Oort cloud, conducting long-range trade, and then suddenly jump out for an unknown destination.

Lurent ships do not always advertise their presence.
Some will remain in-system for years, often undetected in the far outsystem. Usually, the ship’s leaders will want to trade but if they do not then the ship will go about its business without regard to outsiders. This makes some world governments suspicious but there are no records of unprovoked attacks by Lurent vessels.
When they do choose to make war, it is usually on corsairs and similarly deserving recipients, and almost always through mercenaries rather than directly.

The trading vessels of the Lurent exert considerable influence on the systems they visit and have the capability to transport personnel and even large ships across the sector without attracting attention. The Lurent are quite happy to sell this capability like any other commodity.

Lurent merchant symbol

The United Followers of Augurgh (UFA)
Despite its name, the UFA is not all that united, nor are its members all followers of the overall leader.
It is a rather loose alliance of world governments and other organizations, some of them unofficial in nature. The UFA was founded on the world of Augurgh in the Aegaek subsector around 1090, although accounts vary as to exactly when it became a political movement to be taken seriously. It was initially a pro-Augurgh movement intended to increase control over neighboring worlds in Provence sector but grew beyond the expectations of its founders.

Augurgh’s emissaries managed to gain the loyalty of various political factions, corsair bands and trading alliances, although some joined the movement more due to favours owed than allegiance to Augurgh. With this large but thinly-spread powerbase, Augurgh was able to apply pressure to other world governments in the Million and Aegeak subsectors.

The UFA today claims the loyalty of a chain of worlds stretching all the way to the Imperial border and has significant influence over some Imperial worlds in the Million subsector. Loyalty is claimed rather than concrete, with member worlds breaking away at times or groups withdrawing their allegiance. This sometimes leads to internal conflict or policy decisions made more with the aim of placating disaffected supporters than with the best interests of its members.

The UFA maintains the trappings of a legitimate and stable interstellar state, modelling many of its institutions on those of the Imperium. It has a formally organised navy, although this is composed mainly of donated vessels and subject to mutinies as a faction decides to leave the UFA and withdraws its forces.
The UFA is also quite happy to use piracy, raiding and organised crime to influence governments and increase support. In this, it at times can seem more like a protection racket than a multiworld government.

It is possible to deal with the UFA as a normal interstellar state and agreements are upheld unless internal politics requires a different approach. However, the UFA is a dangerous neighbor to have – stable enough to take concerted action but prone to rapid changes in policy or deliberate flouting of its rules by rebellious members.

PLACES OF INTEREST Deneb has a number of unique locations whose existence may be known several sectors away. Most notable of these is the supergiant star Deneb itself, which is sufficiently bright to be used as a navigational calibration point from hundreds of parsecs away and is visible in daylight on many worlds. A segment of the Great Rift runs through Deneb and is notable for the opposite reason – it is a region with few or no stars that presents a major barrier to navigation

Phenomena A number of stellar and interstellar phenomena exist, notably the giant star Deneb and Minde’s Star in the Inar subsector. Both are used as calibration points by navigators, for different reasons. Deneb is visible from a great distance and easily detectable by instruments, whereas the unpredictable variations in the luminosity of Minde’s Star make it stand out as an anomaly.

In addition, there are other phenomena of interest to Travellers. Most are of a typical sort – rifts and mains –
but there are a few exceptions.

Jump Bridges Jump bridges are deep-space refuelling stations serving commercial traffic. Normally constructed on or close to an ice asteroid or comet, their role is to allow jump-1 ships to cross a gap between mains or clusters. This means making a jump to deep space, which must be very precise to avoid being stranded. Few astrogators like using jump bridges since it means betting the lives of everyone on board on a perfect plot with no random factors to cause variance. In reality, using a jump bridge is only slightly more hazardous than a normal jump, although the stakes are higher and this can be wearing on the nerves over time.

Jump bridges are very similar to any other starport, although they tend to have large docking areas for tankers or shuttles bringing in asteroidal ice for conversion into fuel. Facilities vary from extremely utilitarian to positively luxurious. The bridges located close to Pretoria are showcases of excellence to rival any planetary port; this was quite deliberate, as the Dukes of Pretoria wanted to attract interstellar trade and were prepared to invest heavily in making the experience of using the bridges as pleasant as possible.
Other jump bridges exist elsewhere but are generally of a lower standard.

### Jumping to a Bridge

It is only possible to use a jump bridge if its position is precisely known and the astrogator must have an extremely accurate set of coordinates. In the case of commercial jump bridges these are available at nearby starports and are constantly updated.

Jumping to a jump bridge requires an extremely tight jump plot, requiring a Difficult (10+)
Astrogation check. Most astrogators will offset this difficulty by taking longer over the plot. The alternative is to buy a template jump solution from a nearby starport. Most ports within one jump of the bridge will have them for sale. The usual cost is Cr500 but in some cases the plot is discounted, or even free, to encourage use of the bridge. Using a pre-generated solution still requires finalization but this is a Routine (6+) Astrogation check.

Ideally, ships jump directly to the jump bridge and emerge very close to it. Standard maneuver drives perform very poorly in deep space, so a ship that has to navigate to the bridge after emergence may take some time to get there. Most bridges used manned or robotic tugs to bring in ships that arrive too far out to reach the bridge within a few hours. These tugs are equipped with reaction drives or deep-space manouvring systems to permit efficient operation.

The Effect of the Astrogation check indicates how close to the bridge the vessel arrives.

### Jump Bridge Variance

Effect Variance 6 or better Perfect jump. Docking in 4D minutes 4-5 Excellent jump. Docking in 2D hours 2-3 Good jump. Docking in 4D hours 1 Adequate jump. Docking in 1D days 0 Poor jump. Docking in 2D days
-1 or worse

Disaster!

These times assume a vessel moving under its own power using a standard drive. A vessel towed by tugs or using reaction drives can make the approach in half the time.

A vessel suffering a Disaster does not emerge close to the jump bridge. It may be able to crawl across the intervening gap over a period of weeks or months if its power and supplies do not run out, or be rescued by a reaction-drive ship if one is available. If not, the occupants face a slow death

- quite possibly within sensor and comms range of

the jump bridge but beyond any hope of rescue.

Jumping Through the Sargasso Any vessel charting a course through the Dunmag Sargasso suffers DM-1D to the crew’s Engineering and Astrogation (determine separately for each)
checks to jump. The cumulative Effect of these checks is used to determine if something untoward has occurred.

Effect Result
-10 or lower Trapped
-9 to -6 Major Variance
-6 to -3 Minor Variance
-2 to 0 Slight Variance 1+ No Variance

Variance indicates an increase in jump duration and emergence position:
Slight: Jump duration is increased by 2D-2 hours; this is often too small to be noticed. Emergence position will be off by 2Dx10 diameters.
Minor: Duration is increased by 4D hours.
Emergence is off by 2Dx100 diameters.
Major: Duration is increased by 2D-1 days.
Emergence is off by 2Dx1,000 diameters

A ship that suffers a Trapped result emerges from jump within the Sargasso gas cloud after a normal jump duration. Escape may depend upon finding some suitable source of fuel, perhaps scavenged from a less fortunate vessel.

Lurent Planetoid Ships The giant planetoid ships of the Lurent can occasionally be encountered in the inner system, or even in orbit around a mainworld, but far more commonly remain in the far outsystem or Oort cloud, sending smaller and more conventional vessels to trade with the worlds of the system.
Lurent presence is usually quite obvious, with several of their craft and ships moving back and forth, and the planetoid parent vessel broadcasting on many channels.

However, sometimes a planetoid ship will quietly move through the Oort cloud, perhaps observing local conditions before announcing its presence or ensuring it has sufficient fuel to depart before opening trade relations. It has been speculated that some ships may lie in the outsystem for years, for purposes known only to their crews. Some older Lurent planetoid ships have no jump drives and are still in the middle of a long sublight transit. The population will not be in low berths

- the ship is a living community, sending those who

feel the need to head homeward aboard jump-capable vessels and receiving new personnel and supplies at planned rendezvous points. More than one Lurent ship has acted as a jump bridge for years at it crosses the gap between mains at a relative crawl compared to the jump-capable ships that visit it to obtain fuel.

The Dunmag Sargasso An area within the Dunmag subsector (hex 1816) is designated as a sargasso; a region that blocks jump travel or makes it more hazardous. The Dunmag Sargasso is not hazardous compared to similar phenomena elsewhere but it still traps the occasional starship.

The Dunmag Sargasso is thought to have been created when two rogue gas giants collided in deep space, strewing low-density gas throughout the surrounding region. The gas cloud is just dense enough to interfere with jump operations, although most ships pass by with no harm or experience only mild effects such as slightly longer jump times, rough emergence or greater variance in the emergence point, such that the ship may need to make a transit in normal space of a day or two rather than arriving directly at the target world.

However, the Dunmag Sargasso is said to have trapped hundreds of starships over the centuries. There is little scientific data available but spacers bar-room tales speak of lost Imperial and alien ships, including species never seen elsewhere in Charted Space. The speaker usually knows someone who met a crewmember of a ship that got stuck and made an incredible escape but

could not bring anything back to prove the story. Details of how the ship got out of the sargasso and reached an inhabited system are usually rather vague.

### Naval Fuel Depots

In the event that war breaks out in the Spinward Marches, elements of the Deneb and Corridor sector fleets will be transferred to reinforce the local fleet. This is an immense undertaking, requiring months, at best, and much longer if the fleet has to stop to refuel along the way. To facilitate these large-scale redeployments, a series of deep-space fuel caches has been deployed.
The fleet will jump to these rather than inhabited star systems and tankers can collect fuel from the caches to get ahead of the fleet and provide rapid refuelling.

This system allows the Imperial Navy to make best use of its standard jump-4 capability, whereas using the normal spacelanes might restrict the fleet to an average of 3 parsecs or less per jump. It does, however, absorb considerable manpower just to keep caches stocked and maintained, and deployments are dull and lonely.
The existence of the caches is supposedly secret but too many naval personnel have mustered out after pulling a hitch at one for their existence and location to remain completely secret. Without very precise coordinates, no other ship could find a cache other than by extremely careful long-range sensor operations using high-quality equipment. Thus, caches are kept secure by the vastness of space (although, in theory, a location could be obtained from a disabled naval vessel’s secure computer archives).

The caches are enormous, but made up of little more than fuel tanks plus a docking station for tugs and support craft. They are used by the navy’s courier network from time-to-time – enough fuel for one jump-6 courier will never be noticed – enabling the fleet to not only move information fast but to do so without anyone knowing a courier has passed. This capability lies at the heart of all manner of conspiracy theories, although in reality most urgent messages that pass this way deal with minor situations requiring a lone cruiser rather than all-out war with some major power.

### The Pagamin Graveyards

Pagamin, in Dunmag, was the site of a major naval battle in close orbit. The region around the mainworld is designated a war grave, as are cemeteries on-planet

where the dead are laid to rest. Dozens of wrecked ships still orbit Pagamin, slowly being salvaged by licensed operations who must extract the bodies of their crews with due ceremony before beginning work on the vessel.

It is known that unlicensed scavengers also pick over the starship graveyard, seeking components or valuables for resale. These crews are less than respectful of the living and dead alike; fights between licensed salvage crews and scavengers are not uncommon. Rumors abound that the base on Pagamin that was at the centre of the battle contained something both sides were desperate to deny the other and that Pagamin was pounded flat from orbit to eliminate it. If so, some trace of whatever it was might be found aboard one of the wrecks.

Gas-Sharks Gas-sharks are native to the atmosphere of several gas giant worlds within Deneb and elsewhere in Charted Space. They may be the same species that has somehow spread throughout the universe or could be an example of parallel evolution. Either way, gas-sharks do not resemble any form of aquatic creature; their name is fanciful but has stuck. They take the form of a cloud of dense gaseous matter or vapour, which does not appear to contain any organs or anything similar in function.
Gas-sharks are mildly corrosive and can eat their way into a starship given time. However, they are more likely to enter through fuel scoops or attach themselves to the hull of a vessel that enters their territory.

Gas-sharks feed on a variety of chemicals present in a gas giant’s atmosphere, metabolising them by breaking down organic matter and some inorganic compounds.
Among these are lubricants and seals used in many types of shipboard equipment. A gas-shark can be disrupted (say by passing through a fuel filter) but will reform, apparently unharmed, in a matter of hours.

Very little is known about these creatures, other than they are dangerous. There are reports of contact with them all over the sector but no reliable picture has emerged of which gas giants are infested and which are not. Skimming fuel or otherwise entering the atmosphere of an infested gas giant does not guarantee contact and a previously ‘safe’ fuel skimming site might conceal a colony... or perhaps a lone gas-shark might have been carried there aboard an ill-fated starship.

GAS-SHARK

ANIMAL HITS SPEED Gas-Shark 25+ 2m SKILLS —
ATTACKS Dissolve (1D)
TRAITS Flyer (idle)
BEHAVIOUR Omnivore Grazer

Hand weapons and projectiles have no effect on them other than to stir the cloud around a little. Likewise lasers are largely ineffective and will damage whatever they hit on the far side of the cloud (a laser fired at a gas-shark does one point of damage per die – so a 5D laser weapon will deal 5 points of damage).

Electricity and similar forms of energy will harm a gas-
shark and Stun weapons deliver damage as normal. High temperatures (such as plasma or flame weapons) will also harm a gas-shark but may be inadvisable inside a spacecraft.

A Traveller touched by a gas-shark will be slowly dissolved at the rate of 1D damage per round. Armor is dissolved at the rate of 1 point of Protection per round and once reduced to zero, it is gravely breached and useless. A gas-shark may well find ways into a sealed suit before then. There is a 1 in 6 chance each round of contact with the Traveller by way of a breached seal.
This is not sufficient to cause a suit to fail completely but will result in a leak that could become serious.

RESEARCH STATIONS Deneb has six Imperial research stations, an usually high concentration for any sector. There is no standard form for a research station; some are large complexes on remote planetoids, others are chains of universities located in major cities. The only thing these facilities have in common is that they are far greater in size and capabilities than the typical corporate laboratory or university research department and that they have a charter from the Imperium.

Most research stations concentrate on a narrow remit, and are leaders in their field. In some cases, the nature of research undertaken at a facility is subject to strict secrecy and the station is off-limits to unauthorized visitors. Rumors of superweapons projects and incredible revelations on the nature of the universe abound but most of what goes on in these stations is relatively mundane.

Research stations are normally – but not always –
located in remote areas where access can be easily controlled and typically have their own landing area not available to casual visitors. Armed security is the norm, and there are stiff penalties for anyone entering a facility without permission. It is an open secret that much of what goes on in these places is different to the public-
consumption version and occasionally accusations start flying that a facility dealing with medical research might actually be making biological weapons.

The staff of these facilities are tight-lipped, offering only the standard explanation that cutting-edge research costs a lot of money and there are those who would like to steal data or beat the Imperial authorities to the patent office. Thus a habit of secrecy is maintained even where not necessary, making it harder for data thieves to determine which installations are working on something they want to steal.

There are many research laboratories throughout the sector run by corporations, noble houses and world governments but only six have the Imperial charter.

### Research Station Alpha

Research Station Alpha is located on Arcanum, two parsecs from Deneb in the Usani subsector. Arcanum has been interdicted by the Imperium since 500 due to a biological contaminant pervading the entire ecosphere.
The contamination takes the form of spores from a yeast-like species which has a symbiotic relationship with much of the native flora.

The source of contamination has resisted all attempts to culture it artificially or transplant offworld, and the unique combination of factors that allow it to thrive on Arcanum has never been established. Humans exposed to spores become dependent in the same manner as local life and since the source species will not grow elsewhere, leaving Arcanum is inevitably fatal within a few days. However, the relationship has its benefits too, as the symbiosis results in more or less doubling the individual’s remaining life span.

Research Station Alpha is a sealed and carefully controlled environment that studies this species and its effects. The main laboratories are in orbit, with a groundside installation run by a skeleton sample collecting and analysis staff. Occasionally a staff member is accidentally exposed, leading to a choice whether to continue working in the ‘open’ part of the groundside installation or retire among the world’s population, a stable TL6 society that does not interact with offworlders, except for a small number who undertake necessary work or volunteer as test subjects.

Research Station Beta Research Station Beta is located on Starn in the Inar subsector. Since 685 it has hosted a research and development facility, although this was not always designated a full research station. The installation began as a testing facility for the Imperial Navy and later gained a tactical and analysis centre to become Research Station Beta. Additional departments dealing with large-ship construction techniques were added, catering to the corporate shipbuilding and operations marketplace.

Research Station Beta is located in the ‘mainworld’
asteroid belt and has grown to incorporate facilities on several large planetoids and dwarf planets. Some areas of the facility are strictly off-limits but others serve as a showcase for emerging technologies or are accessible to those on contract to sponsoring megacorproations. This creates a complex security situation, with the research station’s patrol vessels forever chasing off prospecting or mining ships that have wandered too close – or claim to have done so.

Research Station Gamma Research Station Gamma is located on Maelstrom in the the Geniishir subsector; the world was chosen for its unwelcoming conditions and location off the main trade routes, providing effective passive security to the installation. Research Station Gamma specialises in robotics, artificial intelligence and applications of decision-making technology. This focus is common knowledge, to the point where a revolution led by artificially-intelligent domestic appliances and industrial machines has become a common trope in local entertainment shows, with a thinly disguised station Gamma as the usual source.

Research Station Gamma is known to be undertaking parallel research into a number of possible brain models for artificial intelligence, including pure electronic systems, biological systems and a variety of highly exotic possibilities. A revelatory news story a few years ago claimed that ‘clever pond weed’ had been found on an unspecified world outside the sector and transported to Research Station Gamma to create an artificially intelligent biological network. This tale has been dismissed by spokespersons from Research Station Gamma as both preposterous and actually less weird than some of the things they have tried.

Research Station Delta Research Station Delta is located in the Aerfor system, just outside the Imperial border in Million. The system is officially listed as a client state of the Imperium,
reflecting the fact that it is of sufficient strategic importance to be worth fighting over. In addition to the small security force of system defence boats and patrol cutters, the Imperial Navy maintains a guardship deployment in the system to remind all and sundry of its status.

Research Station Delta was set up in 760 to study the system’s unusual composition. Several bodies have high concentrations of heavy elements, with superheavy elements in small deposits. It is thought this is the result of a supernova event in the very distant past but why Aerfor and other bodies in its system formed this way when nearby worlds did not remains unclear.

Not all of the system’s bodies have these characteristics.
Three of the four gas giants (and their moons) do not but these are all thought to be captured bodies due to their highly eccentric orbits. These orbits have perturbed the system’s three planetoid belts, causing a complex scatter of small bodies outside the belts proper and resulting in the terrestrial planets taking a pounding over the millennia. Vessels from the research station can be found all over the system, sometimes spending months searching for a planetoid that simply is not where astrophysics predicts it must be.

Research Station Epsilon Research Station Epsilon is located on Saarinen, at the extreme spinward edge of the Sabine subsector. It is a major centre for underwater planetological studies and, unlike many research stations, has an extensive teaching and training arm. Indeed, Epsilon trains underwater

explorers and scientists from very different areas of expertise and is considered a centre of excellence for field science.

According to the official history of the station it has always been a physical-sciences centre but records are said to exist of a time when Epsilon was a psionics research installation. Rumors tell of a connection with the semi-mythical Order of the White Star, an order of knighthood open only to members with psionic abilities.
An order of that name did exist but details are sketchy and there is no proof that psionic knights ever existed in the Imperium, nor that Research Station Epsilon was associated with them.

Research Station Zeta Research Station Zeta is located at Pashus in Zeng.
Its field of interest is jumpspace phenomena and the development of improved jump drives. As such, its work is highly classified and security even more strict than at most other installations. The research station maintains a number of experimental starships and launches expeditions into the Great Rift to investigate the effects of jumping in very sparse regions of space.

Zeta also undertakes research into temporal physics in general, and the relationship between time and jumpspace in particular. It is thought by some scientists that the jump-6 barrier can be broken once the relationship between time and jumpspace phenomena is established.
Work in this field follows the controversial theories of Ashak Moroyanga whose unexplained death in 881 brought an end to a career marked by erratic brilliance.

MINOR RACES The Deneb sector is home to several minor races.
Some are quite commonly encountered away from their homeworlds; others are more obscure. Members of even low-tech societies sometimes travel or are recruited by agencies and services for their special skills. It can be interesting for Travellers who have previously encountered a member of an unusual species living as a high-tech citizen at a starport to visit his homeworld and find that its inhabitants are still in the stone age.

Individuals from these minor races are as varied as anyone else, although social and cultural values tend to diverge more from the mainstream of interstellar society on backwater worlds. Communities away from the starport region may have had little outside contact in their entire history, possibly resulting in an entirely unique culture.

### Crenduthaar

The Crenduthaar are native to Ghatsoki (sector map hex 0902), with communities on a number of worlds including Pretoria (0406), Inar (1213), Antra (1808)
and Deneb (1925) as well as Regina (Spinward Marches 1910). Their name is commonly rendered as ‘Philosopher Kings of Thaar’, which is quite apt.
Whilst large, with an appearance most humans find intimidating, the Crenduthaar are a peaceable and highly intelligent race.

The Crenduthaar are one of the largest known sapient species, with adults measuring some 2.5 metres in length and massing up to 500kg. Exothermic, bisexual and viviparous, they share many characteristics of Terran mammals, although the young drink blood from special glands in both males and females, and their bodies are protected by scales rather than fur. Their forelegs are modified with a ridge of scales forming a razor-edged blade called a slasher, an adaptation evolved by ancient Crenduthaar to cut the tendons of large beasts on the run and cripple them; they remain formidable weapons.

Crenduthaar are hexapods, with their upper limbs used for manipulation of objects and the lowest pair for walking. The middle set can be used as either arms or legs as the need arises, although they are not as dextrous as the upper limbs. The most obvious feature of the Crenduthaar is their mouth, which is filled with a double row of highly prominent teeth and surrounded by tendrils used for fine manipulation. The constant movement of these tendrils is disturbing to many humans and draws attention to their frightening mouths.

Creating Crenduthaar Travellers The Crenduthaar are nomadic descendants of carnivore/pouncer stock. Massive, powerfully built, with scale-armored hides evolved as protection from their star’s frequent flares, with nightmarish, gape-mouthed heads filled with double sets of razor-edged teeth, they can be terrifying if encountered unexpectedly. Despite their fearful appearance and fanged maws, most Crenduthaar are vegetarians, although some supplement their diet with small animals, which they prefer to eat live.

Characteristics Crenduthaar Travellers roll 3D when generating their STR and END, but only 1D for their DEX.

Traits Crenduthaar Travellers all possess the following traits:
Armor (+3): Crenduthaar have thick scales which grant Protection +3.

IR Vision: Crenduthaar have highly developed vision in the infrared part of the spectrum and can see clearly in darkness.

Natural Weapon (slasher, 2D): Crenduthaar have large razor-edged slashers on their forearms which they can use to cripple enemies. The slashers do 2D damage, and use the Melee (natural) skill.

Careers The following careers from the Traveller Core Rulebook are all suitable for the Crenduthaar: Army, Citizen, Drifter, Marine, and Rogue.

The Crenduthaar evolved in an environment where the sun never sets. For them, the dark side of their world is a cold and forbidding place, a haunt of demons and vengeful gods, where the insane and infirmed go to die. All Crenduthaar have an intense dislike of the dark, which borders on phobia. Even those slightly afflicted are comfortable only when surrounded by light, preferably centered in the red portion of the spectrum.

The Crenduthaar possibly suffered from success coming too early in their development. Their powerful bodies made hunting easy and there is no evidence of predators on their homeworld that could threaten the primitive bands. The only real threat was other Crenduthaar, which was greatly reduced by social rules based on ritualised etiquette.

Having essentially pacified themselves as well as their homeworld, the Crenduthaar stagnated and never developed a technological civilization. They are quite capable of understanding and using technology but even those individuals who have lived offworld for years enjoy returning to a simple stone-age lifestyle. The Crenduthaar have essentially chosen not to progress.
Similarly, they are capable of great violence but prefer to live peaceful lives.

This proved to be their undoing when Vargr arrived on Ghatsoki. Crenduthaar oral histories relate how the Vargr enslaved their people and most of the population on Ghatsoki are still under Vargr rule, creating an exception to the normal live-and-let-live attitude of the Crenduthaar. They will kill Vargr without provocation, if they can get away with it, and consider this more a necessity than murder. Crenduthaar are unlikely to have mercy for Vargr, no matter how helpless, any more than a pest control officer would choose to spare the young or infirm of an ant nest.

This tendency is not allowed to dominate Crenduthaar thinking. They will refrain from murdering a passing Vargr businessman in the starport concourse but hatred will be apparent. Some nobles recruit Crenduthaar as mercenaries, leading to the occasional incident among otherwise loyal and reliable troops, and these mercenaries are thought to have filtered back onto Ghatsoki in the hope of liberating their people.

Gl’lu The Gl’lu are native to Kubishush (0917), a forbidding world with a high-pressure corrosive atmosphere.
Kubishush is wracked by earthquakes, making survival a challenge. Despite this, the Gl’lu had developed a technological civilization by the time they were contacted by the Imperium.

Gl’lu are septapods, with a slimy appearance most humans find highly unpleasant. Four of their six limbs can be used for movement or manipulation of objects

- or a thoroughly disgusting combination of both –

whilst their eyestalk is in constant motion. Gl’lu are hermaphroditic and need an ammonia-rich environment to survive. This makes direct contact with humans rare.

Despite their very alien appearance, the Gl’lu are friendly and welcoming, with a culture familiar to Imperial citizens in many ways. Their art and music are agreeable to human perceptions, while their languages are not difficult to learn and adaptable to the human voice and ear. Technology is locally manufactured but relies heavily on Imperial standards and produces finished goods for the Imperial market through General Products, Ling-Standard Products and Instellarms.

Kubishush has a multitude of subcultures, each with its own language. Government is decentralised, with city-
states governing provinces and smaller cities managing regions within a province. This can lead to issues with variations in local customs, language and laws, but native Gl’lu are employed by both the Traveller’s Aid Society and IISS as translators and guides for visitors.

### Creating Gl’lu Travellers

The Gl’lu are descended from rough-terrain scavenger intimidators and look like nightmarish insectoids. Their porous mottled skin, slimy appendages and periscope-like eyestalk make them look like a cross between a Terran octopus and a slug. Indeed, upon first encountering the race during the Grand Survey, scouts mistook them for a far-flung colony of Githiasko or genetically altered hivers. Their body is asymmetric, with two sets of limbs; the front set comprises four legs, which have adapted hands, while the rear set consists of three stouter legs for stability and power. The Gl’lu have a single gender and for all intents and purposes are hermaphroditic.

### Characteristics

Gl’lu Travellers have the following modifiers applied to their characteristics: END-1, DEX+1, EDU-2

### Traits

Gl’lu Travellers all possess the following traits:
**Atmospheric Requirements:** The Gl’lu depend on an ammonia-rich environment and require a sealed suit to survive in other atmospheres.

**Fast Metabolism (+1):** Gl’lu have a heightened metabolism and very fast reactions. They gain DM+1 to initiative rolls.

**Heightened Senses:** Gl’lu have better hearing and sense of smell than humans. They receive DM+1 to any Recon and Survival checks they have to make.

**IR Vision:** Gl’lu have highly developed vision in the infrared part of the spectrum and can see clearly in darkness. However, they can only see in infrared.

**Natural Weapon (fangs, 1D+2):** Gl’lu have sharp fangs that they can use to bite enemies. The fangs do 1D+2 damage and use the Melee
(natural) skill.

### Careers

All careers from the _Traveller Core Rulebook_ are suitable for the Gl’lu.

Gl’lu Starships The Gl’lu have become a minor starfaring race and thousands of Gl’lu traders can be found throughout the region. Their best-selling commodities include high-
grade materials and innovative environmental products, while the synthetic slime coating that grants the wearer protection from airborne corrosives is less than attractive to other races.

Gl’lu starship design is a focus of obsession with backup systems and redundancy, and all Gl’lu starships have two bridges and two maneuver drives, typically situated as far apart as possible. To a human, this wasted space seems inefficient and in cases of multiple backups even ludicrous, but to a Gl’lu humans live on borrowed time onboard ships with no real redundancy of critical systems.

The Gl’lu are accustomed to inhabiting small spaces and their staterooms require much less space than those intended for humans. They do not suffer any penalties for working within a small bridge (see page 17 of High Guard ) and a Gl’lu stateroom can comfortably support eight Gl’lu rather than two humans.

GL’LU TRADER

This trader is typical of Gl’lu design and many like it can be found in the Sabine and Inar subsectors. Noticeably larger than a free trader, its size is necessary to compete with comparative merchants from the Imperium, due to the notorious design features of the Gl’lu. While cramped inside, the trader is supremely reliable and a well-maintained vessel can keep on plying trade routes for decades at a time.

Kirissukyoya The Kirissukyoya are native to Giikusu (2316), although they can be encountered almost anywhere in the sector aboard their own ships or travelling on those of other races. They evolved as hunters in the extensive forests of their world, where their six-limbed bodies adapted to movement among the undergrowth or along branches.

The Kirissukyoya developed a technological society despite a series of highly destructive wars, then plunged themselves into barbarism in a global conflict around
-2000. They might have become extinct but for the intervention of Droyne from Zeen, who helped some enclaves stabilize and eventually begin to rebuild the technological base. This process was accelerated after the Kirissukyoya became Imperial citizens and today they have a spacefaring civilization.

Much of Giikusu was reclaimed by forest after the fall of civilization and although cities are now being built in these areas the Kirissukyoya are respectful of their ancient woodlands. Possibly as a result, they are not welcoming of visitors to their homeworld although are friendly and sociable when encountered on their travels. Giikusu has only the most basic starport available to outsiders, although most major cities have a port for local traffic that is of much better quality. Special licences are required to use these ports and are not granted lightly.

Lurent The Lurent are a minor race native to Borlund in the Lamas subsector. They are large creatures, taking up as much space as six humans, with a headless torso in two segments. The thorax contains sense organs and has two tentacle-like appendages used for manipulation.
The abdomen has a pair of legs used for locomotion and a vestigial tail, and the entire body is covered in fur, usually in shades of pale blue or green.

The Lurent seem to go through cycles where they are compelled to wander far from their homes, eventually returning to become sedentary. Cycles vary in length; an individual might wander for months or decades and will not always settle for an equal period before setting out again. Lurent are tied to their place of origin somehow, and can become distressed if unable to return. The homeward urge is as powerful as the desire to leave and has defied clear scientific explanation.

Creating Kirissukyoya Travellers The Kirissukyoya have trilateral symmetry, with three arms and three legs. While Kirissukyoya have a recognizable head, their brains are located within their torsos.

Characteristics Kirissukyoya Travellers have the following modifiers applied to their characteristics: STR-1

Traits Kirissukyoya Travellers all possess the following traits:
Eidetic Sense (hearing): Kirissukyoya are able to recall anything they hear with perfect clarity.

Natural Weapon (claws, 1D): Kirissukyoya have retractable claws that they can use to eviscerate enemies. The claws do 1D damage and use the Melee (natural) skill.

Skill (mechanic 1): Kirissukyoya have an innate understanding of mechanical processes and all possess the skill Mechanic 1.

Careers All careers from the Traveller Core Rulebook are suitable for the Kirissukyoya.

Creating Lurent Travellers Lurent are very large by human standards. They have no vocal cords and communicate by a mix of tentacle gesture and body language. Their language is very subtle, with complex nuances of gesture

that humans simply cannot replicate. Lurent can hear perfectly well but sometimes forget to listen to words instead of following gestures. This can lead to embarrassing misunderstandings or occasional violence.

Characteristics Lurent Travellers roll 2D+4 when generating their STR and END.

Traits Lurent Travellers all possess the following traits:
Natural Weapon (Tentacle Bash, 2D): Lurent are big and powerful enough to be able to smash many opponents without needing to pick up a weapon.
Their tentacles do 2D damage and use the Melee
(natural) skill.

Wanderlust: Lurent who are in a ‘wandering cycle’
cannot remain in one place for long. They will constantly agitate to be moving on and become increasingly irritable if they cannot. Those in a ‘homeward’ cycle will do the same but are compelled to make progress in the direction of Borlund. A Lurent in a ‘sedentary’ cycle will want to stay where he is and not be receptive to suggestions of further travel.

Careers The following careers from the Traveller Core Rulebook are all suitable for the Lurent: Drifter, Merchant, Noble, Rogue, Scout and Scholar.

### Martian

The people widely known as Martians, or sometimes Marzians, call themselves by a number of words all of which translate as ‘us’, ‘we’ ‘the intelligent people of the forests’ or other typical self-names. Since most of these are difficult for outsiders to pronounce, the nickname is widely used instead. It seems that the Martians do not really have a concept of themselves as a species, instead referring to their home group as ‘us’ and everyone else of any species as ‘others’.

Physically, the Martians are lightly built humanoids with long arms, reflecting their evolution in the warm, spindly

forests where most still make their homes. Traditional villages consist of a handful of extended families, creating a polity whose various names translate as ‘us’
or ‘my village’ with no attempt to identify which one it is to an outsider. Martians are quite happy to travel beyond their ‘us’ but everywhere that is not the home village is foreign – they make no distinction between being in a village a few kilometres from home or on a distant moon a thousand light-years away. Anywhere that is not home, is not home; there really is nothing more to it for a Martian.

Creating Martian Travellers Martians are humanoid and can carry out any task a human can with roughly equal efficiency once they have been shown how. Their language is very difficult to pronounce and hard to follow for non-
Martians, so they tend to use Anglic or other local languages, which they have no apparent difficulty in learning.

Characteristics Martian Travellers have the following modifiers applied to their characteristics: STR-1, END-
1, DEX+1. EDU is rolled on 1D and cannot be increased beyond 7.

Traits Martian Travellers all possess the following traits:
Adaptability: All Martians have an instinctive ability to figure out what a tool or item can be used for –
which may not be its intended purpose – or to find, make or wrangle something with which to complete a given task. An INT check (difficulty depends on the nature of the task and the resources at hand)
allows the Martian to come up with an off-the-wall solution to a problem using whatever is to hand.

Telepathic Confusion: Attempts to use telepathy on a Martian invariably fail, leaving the telepath baffled and uneasy.

Careers Most careers from the Traveller Core Rulebook are suitable for Martians, although they gravitate towards ‘frontiersman’ careers or hands-on jobs like infantry soldiers. A Martian Scholar would be a curious individual, with an alarming and very strange approach to science.

Traditional society uses a curious mix of what are essentially stone-age techniques and materials, mid-tech tools and occasional imported equipment. A Martian will happily use a power tool to knap a stone axe head so he can work on a building project. Thus a traditional village is TL0-1 but the people will make adept use of literally any device or tool they can lay their hands on. Those Martians who live in the cities make use of whatever technology is available but would probably revert to their traditional way of life if others did not provide the technology.

Martians are supremely adaptable to new tools and technologies but have not become dependent upon them. As a result, they are sometimes recruited for colony proving expeditions, coping well with setbacks that might drive more conventional thinkers to despair.
Some even join high-technology services such as merchant lines or the Imperial Navy. Their overall philosophy is curious, in that they have no real interest in ‘why’. So long as a Martian knows that

action A produces result B, he does not care how or why this happens.

It is possible that everything a Martian ever learns is stored as a separate experience, with few underlying connections and no framework of understanding. Thus a Martian knows that he will fall if he lets go of the ladder but trying to explain gravity or the idea that there is a science called physics to him will result in a shrug and polite incomprehension. There are those who have postulated this indicates a very different form of sentience, which may be worth intense study, although no major research project has been launched.

### Segani

The Segani are a more or less humanoid people, with leathery, faintly iridescent skin that hangs in folds around the head and neck in a manner reminiscent of a hood or scarf. Segani are tall by human standards, with few individuals failing to reach two metres in height.
They have long bones and greater skin surface area than a typical human, helping them shed heat whilst their head-skin folds protect from direct sunlight. It is not clear whether they are an engineered species or if they evolved naturally but they are known not to be native to their ‘homeworld’ of Segan.

Creating Segani Travellers Segani are not very suitable as Travellers, as roleplaying may well require a slow descent into madness or desperate attempt to cling to sanity every time their ship jumps. However, Segani might be encountered in full (or more or less full) control of their faculties.

Characteristics Segani Travellers roll 2D for all characteristics except END. This is rolled on 1D+2 giving a maximum starting value of 8. No Segani can increase their END above 10 by any means.

Traits Segani Travellers all possess the following traits:
Desert Adaptation: Segani receive DM+2 on all Survival or Recon checks when in an arid environment.

Quick to Anger: A Segani can go from passive to all-out attack in seconds, lunging at an opponent before either of them knows the Segani is about to do it. Segani gain DM+2 to initiative rolls.

Careers The following careers from the Traveller Core Rulebook are all suitable for the Segani: Army, Citizen, Entertainer, Rogue, Scholar.

The Segani are an aggressive people, adept at quick movement in the desert and striking by surprise.
Physically fragile, their methods of warfare emphasise dispatching opponents quickly – whether by a sudden strike with a knife, a sniper’s bullet or rapid assault by grav cavalry. Their history is one of near-constant conflict, although of limited nature.

Segani technology peaked at TL10 around -400 and they had settlements on other bodies in their solar system when the Imperium arrived. However, they did not make use of the jump drive, as being in jumpspace can drive them insane. Those few who travel beyond their home system normally make use of low berths but even this can be risky to their mental health. A number of ports in the region have a handful of crazed old Segani wandering their alleyways or being treated in mental institutions, however no cure has been found for the instability caused by jump travel.

Creating Shi’awei Travellers The Shi’awei body has an internal bone skeleton, lymph-like circulatory fluid and is covered by a waterproof skin. There are two genders, with the female slightly more numerous than males.
Males tend to have slightly lower strength but greater endurance. Both possess sonar and have excellent chemical receptors and touch sensitivity, communicating with consonantal clicks, which transmit well under water.

Characteristics Shi’awei Travellers roll 3D when generating their STR and END, but only 1D for their DEX.

Male Shi’awei Travellers also have the following modifiers applied to their characteristics: STR-1, END+1

Traits Shi’awei Travellers all possess the following traits:
Echolocation (30m): Shi’awei use a highly sensitive echolocation sense to navigate their environment, effectively allowing them to ‘see’ underwater or in complete darkness to a range of 30 metres.

Fast Metabolism (+1): Shi’awei have a heightened metabolism and very fast reactions. They gain DM+1 to initiative rolls.

Natural Weapon (grippers, 2D): Shi’awei have large grippers on two of their arms that they can use to bludgeon enemies. The grippers do 2D damage and use the Melee (natural) skill.

Swimmer (9m): Shi’awei are superb swimmers and can move through water at a speed of 9 metres.

Careers The following careers from the Traveller Core Rulebook are all suitable for the Shi’awei: Drifter, Entertainer, Noble and Rogue.

Shi’awei The Shi’awei are native to Chaosheo (0130). They are an aquatic people adapted to life in deep water and have little contact with outsiders. Their society is highly fragmented, with cultures varying enormously from one group to another. Some communities are friendly, others likely to kill and eat anyone who attempts to visit them.
It is not known if this hostility is innate or somehow triggered, nor if the culture of a group varies over time.
There are records of contact with groups of Shi’awei in the same locality turning out very differently each time, although it is not clear if this was the same community.

Some groups of Shi’awei interact with non-native communities set-up on what little land Chaosheo possesses but significant difficulties exist even here.
Most have access only to the most basic metalworking, using heat from geothermal vents.

The Shi’awei have a bullet-shaped body with four arms evenly spaced around the torso and fins at the tail. Two of their arms have grippers capable of exerting great pressure; the other two are used for fine manipulation.

Creating Souggvuez Travellers Souggvuez Travellers have the following modifiers applied to their characteristics: DEX+1, INT-1, EDU+1. This is further modified by caste.

Caste Characteristics Designer: DEX+1, END-1 Explorer: DEX+1, END-1, INT-1, EDU+1 Hunter: DEX+1, INT-1 Worker: INT-1, EDU+1

Traits Souggvuez Travellers all possess the following traits:
Armor (+1): All Souggvuez have +1 point of Protection.

Bite: All Souggvuez possess a set of powerful teeth capable of doing 1D+2 damage using the Melee
(natural) skill.

Careers All careers from the Traveller Core Rulebook are suitable for Souggvuez.

### Souggvuez

The indigenous people of Talon generally use the Vargr name for themselves – Souggvuez – rather than their own self-name, ever since the two societies became intermingled. The Souggvuez are slightly larger than humans but more slightly built, with an asymmetrical three-section torso. The ‘walking’ section has three strong ‘walking legs’, with five ‘balancing legs’ in front of this. Their four arms end in dual-thumbed hands.

The complex system of gender-castes of the Souggvuez includes an egg-carrier/guardian of the young known as Hatchers, which require genetic material from two other castes to fertilise a clutch of eggs. Normally 2-6 young are produced by a Hatcher, with gender-caste varying across a clutch.

There are four other gender-castes, known to outsiders as Designers, Explorers, Hunters and Workers. The latter tend to be more solidly built than other gender-castes but there are few other outward indications.

The Souggvuez are ‘doers’ rather than ‘thinkers’ and this is reflected in both their learning abilities and society. They pick up new skills quickly but are poor at retaining complex details and leadership is based more upon status than qualifications. The latter made them compatible with the Vargr, who readily slotted into leadership roles within Souggvuez society.

As a result, traditional Souggvuez society has been eroded and replaced with a Vargr-style system of clans based upon loyalty to charismatic individuals of both species. Most Souggvuez seem unaware that anything has changed and have little attachment to their old way of life. The efforts of Imperial scientists to study and preserve the traditional art and culture of the Souggvuez generally meet with bafflement; things are how they are and if the old ways were good enough to care about they would not have been forgotten.

The Souggvuez have poor vision and no sense of smell; however they do have an innate ability to detect electrical fields. This can best be described as a form of
‘remote touch’ and is not very precise, but can allow a Souggvuez to find concealed cables or avoid an electric shock. Their bodies are covered in fine scales that convey a little protection.

Creating Yafizethe Travellers Yafizethe are small but tough, with an exoskeleton providing protection for their bodies.

Characteristics Yafizethe Travellers roll 3D when generating their DEX but only 1D for their STR and END. They also have the following modifiers applied to their characteristics: INT+1

Traits Yafizethe Travellers all possess the following traits:
Enhanced Vision (electromagnetic): Yafizethe are capable of seeing electromagnetic fields as well as possessing normal vision.

Small (-1): Yafizethe are small and present a difficult target. All ranged attacks made against the Yafizethe suffer DM-1.

Careers The following careers from the Traveller Core Rulebook are all suitable for the Yafizethe: Drifter, Entertainer, Noble and Rogue.

Yafizethe The Yafizethe are native to Kernal (0626), an agricultural world in the Star Lane subsector. The rear part of their long body supports eight pairs of short
‘walking legs’ whilst the front part is held upright and supports two pairs of longer legs used as arms or to clear a way through difficult terrain. The brain and primary sense organs are contained in the head.

Yafizethe possess above-average intelligence and the ability to ‘see’ electrical fields. They evolved in rocky badlands but have spread out to inhabit all of their world, which was gradually unified into a single world-
state. This was achieved mainly through negotiation, requiring the creation of training programmes to create vast numbers of skilled diplomats. In recent years, Yafizethe negotiators have found employment across the sector in corporate and political positions.

Mykel Alvis (Order #36934621)

All of the standard vessels in Imperial service can be encountered in Deneb, along with a few designs more or less unique to the region. The vast majority of these ships are commercial or utilitarian in nature, since it is interstellar commerce that supports the battle fleets and specialized vessels.

Most ship operators in Deneb have access only to the mainstream technologies available elsewhere but some can obtain unique items from non-human races or extremely advanced components produced in the TL16 factories of Vincennes.

VINCENNES

TECHNOLOGY Vincennes has a technological edge over the rest of the Third Imperium. The following High Guard components are available to the shipyards of Vincennes.

Electronics: The electronics suites of Vincennes-built ships are very advanced, creating significant advantages for their ships. TL16 computer and sensor packages are available in limited numbers on the open market and in greater quantities to those who have the right connections or are friendly with Vincennes.

Processing Tech Level Cost Computer/40 16 MCr40 Core/110 16 MCr150 Sensors TL Suite DM Power Tons Cost Superior 16 Densitometer, Jammers, Lidar, Neural Activity Sensor, Radar

+3 8 8 MCr8.4

Advanced Countermeasures Suite: Improving upon the already formidable military countermeasures suite, this system can overwhelm any enemy communications networks it encounters.

The advanced countermeasures suite grants DM+8 to all attempts at jamming and electronic warfare, regardless of the usual DM of the sensor suite it is attached to.

An advanced countermeasures suite consumes 20 tons and costs MCr40. It requires 5 Power.

Other systems: Ships built at Vincennes typically use advanced jump drives (see page 48 of High Guard ) that

have the decreased fuel advantage, while warships are often equipped with black globe generators.

DEMILITARISED

AND CONVERTED

WARSHIPS There are rules in place within the Imperium regarding who is permitted to operate what sort of ship and what weapon systems can be carried. Accountability is the key factor; a world government is generally considered more accountable for its actions than a small corporation with an easily relocated centre of operations.
There is also the level of trust to be considered; a world that has rebelled several times in the last two centuries that suddenly wants to buy battleships, will not receive a favourable response.

Power and influence can override many rules, however, the client must be able to afford the ships. The Imperial authorities do care if the vessels are affordable to the end client, for two reasons. Firstly, there is always the risk that a world government may buy ships it cannot afford, then sell them to less than desirable operators, and secondly the purchase of ships a client cannot afford suggests they will be put to use in the near future.
This interests intelligence services, who constantly watch for internal wars, rebellions and powerplays.

Some trusted operators can build or purchase warships of any capability, but a few technologies are restricted to the Imperial armed forces and are never transferred to other users. For others, options are more limited.
Some classes of ship (such as battleships and fleet carriers) may be prohibited, leading to some interesting legal fictions that allow builds; a few shipyards construct ‘heavy commerce protection vessels’ that are essentially cruisers for users not normally permitted to have major warships.

Alternatively, ships may be demilitarised before sale.
The precise definition of demilitarization is somewhat flexible but generally means that spinal mounts are removed along with some or all bay weapons. A general reduction in fighting power is always considered
‘demilitarization’ even if the vessel remains a powerful fighting unit. The areas freed up by the removal of weapon systems can be used for other purposes, although this is never 100% efficient due to the shape and location of spaces.

### Retrofitting

It is common for old warships to be converted into system defence vessels. Whilst some components of the jump drive may be degraded, enough remains reusable in most ships to be a valuable source of spares for other vessels. Components can also be sold to offset the cost of the conversion. A ship that no longer has jump capability does not need enormous fuel tanks and these can be converted to other uses.

Conversely, weaponry and other components can be retrofitted to ships that did not previously have them.
Minor systems, like laser turrets and a small additional power plant to support them, can be fitted into odd spaces, effectively reducing cargo capacity or replacing a stateroom or two.

VENTURER-CLASS

FAST FREIGHTLINER Designed and operated exclusively by Tukera Lines –
other than a handful of vessels passed to other owners after suffering damage or incidents such as the notorious ships-for-votes affair of 1096 – the _Venture_ **_r_** -class is fast in two ways. First, it has a two-jump-2 capability, enabling it to cross a four-parsec gap between major ports without the need to follow mains or standard shipping routes. The _Venturer_ also uses a lighter-aboard-ship
(LASH) configuration to permit rapid cargo transfers.

LASH ships carry little cargo internally but instead use cargo lighters that are little more than powered cargo pods. These can be dropped the moment the ship emerges from jump, to make their way towards the starport under their own power. A replacement set of pre-loaded lighters can be waiting near the jump limit, enabling the vessel to make its second two-parsec jump before a conventional ship would have even reached port. With vessels passing through on the strict schedule for which Tukera is famous, this set-up can be very efficient. It is particularly useful in systems where the mainworld is an asteroid belt or where there are cargoes for several points in the system; all can be delivered at once rather than having to wait for transfer from the main starport.

Of course, this system carries a significant overhead in terms of prepositioned lighters but a small fleet of Venturer -class vessels constantly runs between designated ports, reusing the same lighters and pilots aboard a succession of ships. Normally the standard 100-ton cargo lighter and passenger boat are shipped but when necessary the Venturer can carry a variety of other craft all built on the same hull, with the same fittings.

Lighters are built to TL12 standards on a variety of worlds and used as utility craft by numerous port authorities, world governments and even other shipping operators. The use of a lightly built hull and lower level of technological sophistication keeps costs down and allows these craft to be easily maintained at the ports they visit.

The Venturer is a nominally 3,200 ton design, assuming eight 100-ton lighters are carried aboard. The main hull is rated at 2,400 tons displacement but drives, power plant and fuel assume a full complement of craft. The lighters nestle in recessed cradles and are not quite fully flush with the hull but are well protected against micrometeorite strikes and the like. The ship has little internal cargo space; what there is would normally be used for secure items and ship’s stores rather than standard freight. Shipping containers are left aboard the lighters; if a transfer is desired it has to be done manually through airlocks, which is not an easy task. This is not a problem since the lighters themselves transport goods and the ship carries them from system-to-system.

Passengers transfer from the interface craft to internal cabins. Typically, around 28 passenger cabins are available, plus eight high cabins, although this depends on crewing levels aboard the freightliner. Small craft crew normally live aboard their craft but spend most of their time in the main hull whilst in jump.

Accommodation is of a high quality, with generous common areas and additional spaces, such as small conference rooms, for the use of passengers and crew. The ship is lightly armed for self-defence but not intended to leave well-
patrolled spaceways. A GEM-ship might venture into the frontier but for the most part these vessels are optimised for operations on a safe, regular run and tend to stick to this role.

CARGO LIGHTER

This 100-ton lighter represents the cheapest way possible to carry cargo across a star system, between a highport and LASH-equipped freightliner. The one concession to luxury – if you can call it that

- is the provision of a cabin for the crew or a
  passenger. Many lighter crews more or less
  live aboard their vessel, although they will
  spend most of their working time aboard the

parent vessel when it is in jump.

The lighter is designed to nestle in an external cradle but can be carried internally by a ship with at least a 100-ton docking bay. It costs about two and a half times as much as a slow boat built at the same tech level but carries five times as much cargo – albeit even more slowly.

Built on the same hull as the cargo variant, the passenger lighter is an interface craft designed to move personnel from port to starship. It has a small amount of living space and some cargo capacity but otherwise facilities are basic. The crew will usually include a steward who looks after the passengers during their flight to and from their ship. To accommodate this extra crewmember the craft has a second stateroom.

FUEL LIGHTER

Less commonly encountered than passenger and cargo lighters, the fuel lighter variant can either be used to refuel a ship quickly or as additional tankage for a longer voyage. A ship making a fast transit can be met by full tankers, which dock in the standard cradles and transfer their fuel to internal tanks before they skim additional fuel or to return to base.
Alternatively they can be carried in jump and used to replenish the ship’s internal tanks for a crossing of a wide rift.

GUNSHIP LIGHTER

Built on the same hull form, but in a far more robust manner, the gunship version of the lighter looks very similar but can be identified by its much higher acceleration.
The triple laser turret is mounted in a pop-up configuration so as not to impede docking and also to conceal the fact that the craft is armed. Gunships are used for high-value cargo and passenger transfers and allow a freightliner to function in the GEM-ship (Gunship Equipped Merchant)
role. Essentially, this configuration allows the parent vessel to self-escort or provide additional protection to a convoy. The GEM-ship configuration has applications as a paramilitary vessel and gunships are sometimes encountered as light system defence or patrol craft.

The Brilliance class is a long liner, a high-
jump passenger vessel with very little cargo capacity. It is built on an 800 ton hull to a very high standard, with an impressive jump-4 performance that allows it to travel directly between important worlds. Long Liners typically follow the x-boat routes or ply between major political or trade centres, although some are available for charter. Others are used for VIP personnel transfers or to host small conferences, with common areas configured for discussion, presentations or planning sessions.

Passenger accommodation is extremely luxurious, with the very best food and drink prepared by skilled stewards. It is not uncommon for liners to provide specialist entertainment or education on for a voyage, often tailoring the choice to the passengers’
preferences. A voyage between two systems might be a chance to meet a famous author or former sports personality, take a course from a high-end artist or enjoy performances by professional entertainers.

The Imperial Navy does not make much use of frigate or, more accurately, considers vessels that others might call frigates to be a subset of destroyer escorts. Most frigates within the Imperium are in the hands of private (non-Imperial Navy) users such as world governments, corporations or noble houses. Some examples of the Sydkai-class are operated by the Deneb Sector fleet but there are far more ships of this class outside the navy than serving within it.

The Sydkai is designed as a patrol vessel, with good endurance to allow it to remain on-station for extended periods or make a long sweep through backwater systems. It is lightly armored, with sufficient firepower to overwhelm a corsair or raider before serious damage is sustained. The design is new, having been offered by the GSbAG since 1000 but has demonstrated high capabilities in its intended role. Vessels of this class can be encountered in the private navies of the great nobility or occasionally headed across the border to investigate rumors of a corsair base.

The Deneb Stalwart-class is a common system defence monitor based on a converted P.F Sloan-
class fleet escort. As system defence craft go, it is a high performance vessel, well armored and packing a powerful missile punch for its size.

The conversion is a relatively straightforward one, replacing the fuel tanks with armor and a ring of missile bays and the jump drive with a pair of fusion gun bays. The missile bays are arranged in a ring around the middle of the vessel, with the remaining fuel tankage replaced by a thick belt of Crystalliron armor extended over the rest of the hull. Coverage is not even and some critical areas

- notably the command spaces – are less well

protected than the drives and missile armament.
However, on balance the extra armor adds good protection against most threats.

The replacement of the jump drive with fusion guns necessitates some relocation of powerplant systems, making the vessel a little awkward to operate. The fusion guns cannot fire into the forward arc but this is not normally a drawback. A fast close pass allows the guns to fire unimpeded and fire can be maintained as the monitor accelerates away. More commonly, an engagement is carried out with missiles as far as possible.

can (and often does) greatly increase the cost as luxury items such as ballrooms, theatres and spas are added.

Occasionally the Imperial Navy sells damaged vessels or a client wishes to buy warships but cannot obtain clearance for a full-capability cruiser or battleship.
Even without its spinal mount, a major warship is still a prestigious flagship for a noble or a corporation and can provide useful military capability when operating in a troubled region.

This demilitarised Gionetti has lost its spinal armament, missile capability and tractor beams.
Laser armament has also been reduced, with standard weapons substituted for the advanced beam lasers of the original design. It is otherwise a fully capable warship.

The conversion, in this case, is for the vessel to be the private yacht of a powerful noble. The space originally occupied by the spinal meson gun has been converted into a flight operations centre with hangars for up to 1,000 tons of craft. The former meson tube is now open to space for most of its length, acting as a launch/recovery deck for shuttles and rapid recovery of up to 100 tons of craft at once is possible; larger vessels can be accommodated but must make a careful approach and flight through the short remaining section of the tunnel.

There is an element of ego about this arrangement.
The ship retains its original five cutters as subordinate craft but the ability to launch several fighters at once, then the owner’s private shuttle, followed by another escort flight has its uses. Rapid recovery might be useful in the event of a hurried departure from negotiations gone awry but more commonly it is used to recover a group of escorting fighters at once just for show.

Other features were fitted in the space vacated by the missile magazines. These include an additional and wholly unnecessary command bridge dedicated purely to controlling flight operations of the owner’s shuttle and any escorts, and tracking threats. The owner’s grand suite comprises the equivalent of four luxury staterooms and a large reception/relaxation area, plus an armored vault containing another luxury stateroom, private medical facility and a common area.

Guest accommodation is on the other side of the ship, with several luxury staterooms and a dedicated common area serving the occupants. Former missile storage space now holds a small biosphere created as an ornamental garden, a rather grand library, a firing range and a stable. There is also a ballroom the size of a small merchant ship.

The interior of the ship has been extensively redecorated, with the former drab scheme replaced with real wood panelling and soft carpets. Even the original crew cabins and working areas have been refurbished to improve comfort and – more importantly to the owner – impress those lucky enough to be invited aboard.

Built by the advanced shipyards of Vincennes, the Kehmed dreadnoughts represent the cutting edge of warship design within the spinward sectors of the Third Imperium. Each ship of the class is named after one of the metroplexes on Vincennes and they are a source of pride for many of the inhabitants of the system.

Like the older Plankwell-class, the Kehmed is a traditional battleship with no troop contingent carried aboard. It is intended for a pure warfighting role, smashing the enemy battle line and moving on. Other ships can land marines or mop up whatever resistance remains; these highly advanced battlewagons are too expensive and too potent to be wasted on peacekeeping or insurgency suppression missions. The swing towards multirole capital ships was always controversial and it does seem that a return to specialist designs is the way forward.

## PRETORIA

### DENEB-SUBSECTOR A

The Pretoria subsector contains 31 star systems, of which all but three are Imperial territory. The Imperial Coreward border runs diagonally across the subsector, with a mix of primarily human and Vargr worlds beyond.
This border has traditionally been troubled, with the tumultuous politics of the Vargr Extents spilling into Imperial territory.

Even when there is no large-scale problem to disrupt the Coreward end of Pretoria, corsair raids and minor disputes are common. These do not originate exclusively from coreward; neighboring Aramis subsector in the Spinward Marches provides a route into Pretoria for raiders and troublemakers, as do the unaligned worlds of Lamas, to trailing.

PRETORIA SUBSECTOR

### Deneb

### A

### Rachele Society

The Rachele Society is a secretive Vilani supremacist group founded on Pretoria by Zid Rachele in 992. Violent from the outset, the society quickly escalated into using attacks intended to cause mass casualties. Having demonstrated a willingness to use weapons of mass destruction, the Rachele Society then attempted to hold a number of worlds to ransom with the threat of such an attack.

This culminated in the attempted takeover of the Pretorian government in 1010 but nuclear blackmail backfired when 26,000 people
(including 1,900 Rachelean commandos) were killed in a nuclear explosion after the society seized Imperial scout facilities on Saki. The Imperium tries to stay out of local politics but intervention was forced in order to protect Imperial assets and prevent further use of nuclear weaponry.

The Imperium plans to relax martial law on Pretoria over the next 10 years, although military analysts insist the Rachele Society still exists. Zid Rachele himself disappeared in 1015 after escaping the prison world Exile in the Usani subsector.

Pretoria is at times seen as the politico-economic equivalent of a salient in a defensive line, with (often unrelated) threats coming in from all directions. Not all are of a military nature; a trade dispute just over the border can have serious implications for local industries and ship operators, which in turn can cause dissent on other worlds. There are times when the local nobility long for something as straightforward as a military confrontation. As they say in Pretorian political circles, ‘Oh, for a clear target and nobody behind me with a noose’.

The world of Pretoria lies in the centre of the subsector, well positioned for local governance but isolated from jump-1 trade by surrounding minor rifts. To overcome this problem, jump bridges were created to link Pretoria to Miwald and Caladib. These bridges are permanent deep-space stations where jump-1 ships can refuel and recalibrate their drives. It is thus possible to reach almost any world in the subsector aboard any jump-
capable vessel. The stations are expensive to maintain but benefits to local trade are enormous.

The subsector was originally settled on a small scale as a result of the gradual outward creep typical of Imperial borders. In the 300s the pace increased rapidly as heavy investment was made in a cluster of worlds with impressive mineral wealth. As this local industrial base grew, trade expanded rapidly to follow.
This was not without difficulties; it was not until the 350s that the short-range trade lanes within the subsector were declared safe from piracy. Long-range links back into the Imperium were likewise threatened by raiders for many years, a problem that has never been completely eradicated.

JODE Jode has a high surface gravity and exotic atmosphere, making it a poor prospect for habitation but at the same time offering possibilities for the chemical industry. It was colonized using sealed-environment techniques, although these were primarily workplaces rather than homes. The large orbital port has grown into a city and is home to most of the world’s population. Indeed, the majority of citizens of Jode have never set foot on the planet and would really prefer not to.

Jode has little industry of its own, just some fabrication and light engineering located at the orbital port.
Its economy is entirely based on the extraction and processing of chemicals from its exotic atmosphere or dissolved in its oceans. Although the atmosphere is not

corrosive, it contains a number of compounds – notably chlorine-based – that will damage a human respiratory system if they get into a vehicle or settlement’s internal atmosphere. Those working outside must undergo painstaking decontamination every time they pass into an inhabited area, so where possible this work is done using drones or robots.

Jode apparently suffered an enormous geological event around a million years ago, resulting in the sinking of one of its continents. This also caused the extinction of a native sentient species now referred to as Serpents.
The Serpents did not progress past the stage of using primitive stone tools and few artefacts have been found.
There may be considerably more waiting to be located but finding them means working underwater on a world where a change in weather can result in toxic snow or dangerous chemical concentrations in the water.

MARZ Marz is a warm world with a dense atmosphere, making much of the surface uncomfortable for humans and Vargr. These areas are mainly populated by the native people, often referred to as Martians. Martians make up about 30% of the world population, with the remainder

- around 40% human and 30% Vargr – concentrated in

environment-controlled cities located in temperate and polar regions.

Imperial humans first settled Marz around 400, after the Vargr Campaigns. Various Vargr groups had already been on Marz for some time, although there is no scholarly consensus on when they first settled. Many Vargr gladly submitted to Imperial government, while some fled or fought. To this day, Marz maintains a patrol squadron to manage the ‘corsair problem’ in neighboring systems.

The government of Marz is a ponderous, multi-layered bureaucracy. The needs of the citizens are almost always met... eventually. Justice is meted out slowly, but in relative fairness, and inefficiencies in world management are offset by the wealth generated by trade. Marz acts as a trade nexus between the Imperium and Vargr Extents, as well as between Pretoria and the Aramis Trace.

Trans-border trade is usually carried out by specialist shipping companies, who use well-armed merchant ships or escorted convoys. Many small-ship operators also hop back and forth across the border, creating a major job for the system’s customs enforcement personnel. Trade within the Imperium mostly moves aboard big multi-kiloton freighters by way of Pretoria and smaller vessels within the local cluster.

PRETORIA Pretoria was settled by the Imperium around 300, although there may have been enclaves already on-
planet from earlier, unofficial colonization efforts.
Other than having a thin atmosphere, Pretoria was more or less ideal for colonization and rapidly became a major population and economic centre. Its position on the jump-2 link between the subsector’s two clusters ensured a great deal of through-traffic at the starport, with corresponding economic benefits. As a centre for communications it was inevitable that Pretoria would develop into a major political player and its selection as the subsector capital was a foregone conclusion.

Today, Pretoria exerts considerable influence over a number of worlds in the Spinward Marches. Dubbed the Aramis Trace, these worlds are connected to Pretoria by way of the x-boat route through Marz
(0201). Although not officially part of the Duchy of Pretoria, the governments of these worlds often find it convenient to seek mediation and advice from the duke and will sometimes informally request naval assistance.
Technically, this is a breach of many protocols and could have serious repercussions but the Dukes of Pretoria have traditionally looked out for the worlds of the Aramis Trace – albeit out of self-interest – and the niceties of protocol are sidelined in favour of getting the job done.

Pretoria has a large and very busy starport but its shipyards are currently closed down. The facilities were ordered to cease production after a series of terrorist attacks and whilst the problem appears to have been resolved, permission has not been granted to resume production. It is widely thought that political rivals may have had a hand in this as the longer the yards are closed the more difficult and expensive it may be to restart production. Indeed, it may be that Pretoria has built its last starship.

Most, if not all, of the terrorism directed at Pretoria was the work of the Rachele Society. The security services have made many arrests, and attacks have dwindled to virtually nothing, but it is still thought that the Rachele Society may have active cells on Pretoria.
The starport is subject to heavy security as it has been a target in the past but there is a limit to how secure the facility can be made without crippling trade. Tukera Lines has its own facility – more or less equivalent to a Class A starport but lacking shipbuilding capabilities

- in the system and other megacorporations have their

own smaller ports that are off-limits to most traffic.

REDI Redi lies at the outer edge of the system’s habitable zone, resulting in a low average temperature. This did not make it unsuitable for colonization but Redi never received large-scale population migration or investment, and was left behind during the early development of the subsector. Today, it is regarded as one of the ‘missed-
the-boat’ worlds that is unlikely ever to be anything but a backwater.

Redi’s significance, if that is the right term, is as a probable Ancients site. There is at least one major ruin, with smaller locations suspected to exist in other areas. The Imperial authorities do not normally release information on possible Ancients sites, so it is entirely likely that several artefact caches or ruins have been located and explored by officially sanctioned researchers. The known ruin is disappointing; it consists only of a few structures without machinery or artefacts.
Occasionally, a band of hopeful amateurs finds a way into one of the remaining sealed structures but always return empty-handed.

It is not known what purpose the Ancients had on Redi, if indeed the structures are theirs. Some scientists have suggested that the design of the structures is different and the age is wrong for them to be the work of the Ancients, however Ancients sites do vary considerably and there is no evidence that these structures were built by anyone else.

URNAS Urnas is an uninviting desert world but its location as a jump-1 link in the local cluster, and the presence

of good mineral deposits, attracted early investment.
Urnas had the potential to grow into a major industrial centre but its society fragmented soon after the initial colonization and has remained divided ever since.

Urnas is balkanised, with two major states and numerous smaller ones. By far the majority of the population belong to either Sulan, a theocracy of over 1.1 billion inhabitants or Kasame Upu Uluriri. The latter is a technocracy with around 0.7 billion citizens and is slightly ahead in terms of both technological capability and strategy for implementing those technologies.

These two powerful states have been at odds for centuries. Direct conflict is rare, although both seem quite willing to engage in threats of all-out destruction on a routine basis. Typically, the conflict takes the form of minor incidents followed by a great deal of posturing, troop movements and dire warnings. When open warfare has broken out it has been vicious, resulting in the destruction of the starport and major damage to several population centres. Proxy wars among the smaller states are also frequent. As a result, Urnas is Amber Zoned and much of its industrial output goes to weaponry rather than goods for export.

The system’s planetoid belt and some of its other planets are inhabited, mainly by mining colonies operated by Sternmetal Horizons and Ling-Standard Products. The two major nations of Urnas also maintain outposts elsewhere in the system. These are generally left alone by tacit agreement – neither power wants to fight a war in space which would inevitably result in the loss of outsystem facilities no matter who won.

## LAMAS

### DENEB- SUBSECTOR B

The Lamas subsector is sometimes referred to as
‘Pretoria’s headache’. About half of its 31 star systems lie outside the Imperial border, with varying attitudes towards the Imperium. These attitudes shift over time and can be heavily influenced by the activates of raiders, rebels or forces that attempt to counter them.

Lamas was officially incorporated into the Imperium in the early 500s, but to this day has a troubled

relationship with the rest of the Imperium. There is no subsector duke and no consensus on which of the neighboring dukes should have jurisdiction over the region. As a result, opportunities are exploited in a cut-
throat manner that leads to political - and sometimes actual - infighting and problems are often ignored as being someone else’s responsibility.

LAMAS SUBSECTOR A100100-F

### Deneb

### B

Not coincidentally, Lamas is a hotbed of rebellion, intrigue and piracy. Local leaders do their best to keep the lid on the pot but resources are limited and most world governments lack the capability or authority to do much beyond their own borders. Thus it falls to the Imperial Navy to maintain order, with the Duke of Pretoria providing political guidance. However, even here the wind changes from time-to-time, and the navy can suddenly find itself under pressure from the Duke of Antra or Inar to do something entirely different.

Caught in the middle of this political mess is the 213 th Imperial Fleet. It says much about the situation in Lamas that although each subsector fleet has a
‘unique’ numbered designation, the 213th is actually one of three fleets to bear that number. The others are in neighboring Spinward Marches and Corridor, which adds to the confusion. Personnel, requisitions and even entire squadrons of ships are sometimes sent to the wrong 213th Fleet and it is very rare that such windfalls are ever given back.

This has benefited the Lamas subsector fleet as much as hindered it, although it does mean that the fleet deploys a rather strange mix of vessels. The fleet has become something of a political football in recent years, with one subsector duke pressing for more cross-border patrols only for another to demand the 213th pull back and secure trade routes running across the rimward end of the subsector. As a result, the subsector fleet has acquired an unfair reputation for incompetence and weak leadership.

ANSIRK Ansirk is an all-but-uninhabited rockball, with a tiny population in a single outpost maintained for territorial-
claim reasons. Ansirk is a fragment of a much larger planet, which appears to have fragmented for unknown reasons. It follows an eccentric orbit well inside the primary’s habitable zone, resulting in harsh surface conditions. The worldlet has no atmosphere or surface water although some ice pockets have been located, claimed as critical assets by the starport authority for life support and fuel use.

Normally a rockball of this sort would not be worth colonising but a small community does live and work there. So long as Ansirk has a ‘native’ population, it cannot be claimed by any of the region’s ambitious

world governments or noble houses. Without indigenous people, the world would be up for grabs, which would in turn create legal issues regarding ownership of the starport. The existence of this population is something of a legal fiction, as few of its people were actually born on Ansirk. However, everyone has citizenship of the world even if they are essentially professional residents who will eventually move on to somewhere more welcoming.

Ansirk is rugged and nonregular like a planetoid but the size of a small planet and in a few million years Ansirk’s own gravitational forces will conform it into a rough sphere. It was chosen as the location for the starport partly due to its rich and varied veins of useful metals and radioactives, exposed on the world’s new surface and granting easy access. However, exploitation has not yet begun despite a series of plans put forward by various corporations and governments. Each one has stalled at the negotiation stage, usually over disagreements about profit-sharing and taxation.

A larger fragment of the original world (size 5) lies on the other edge of the habitable zone; it has an insidious atmosphere, is not habitable and interdicted by the IISS. The occasional scientific expedition has been given permission to visit and study the fragment but no conclusions have been published about what happened to the original world.

Ansirk Starport is far more important than the world it orbits, as it serves x-boat routes as well as local trade routes. It is very rare for vessels to visit the world’s small and basic landing area, except to resupply the outpost. Most ships dock at the orbital facility, moving on without going planetside. Although highly automated, the port has a population of several thousand workers, not considered citizens of Ansirk itself but encouraged to apply for citizenship and automatically accepted if they do. The majority are simply employees or business owners who work at Ansirk Starport but call some other world home.

The starport could, in theory, build starships but typically it does not. Instead, its modest yards turn out small craft and fighters for a variety of clients, with a training staff maintained to certify pilots and crew.
Most designs are standard but recently Ansirk Starport has begun recruiting test pilots for an experimental fighter program.

BORLUND Lying close to the Imperial border, Borlund is the homeworld of the Lurent, a minor race found all over the sector and beyond. With a population of over 70 billion, Borlund would be important to the economy of the sector even without the mercantile activities of its people.

Borlund does not have a main starport as such. Instead it has hundreds – possibly thousands – of landing areas all over its surface, each serving a local community.
The Lurent are famous for their planetoid starships and at any time dozens can be found in orbit over Borlund.
From these, interface craft and small trading vessels transit planetside to conduct trade. A given ship might remain in-system for days or months. Some seem to be more or less permanent, essentially powered artificial moons, whilst others are gone for decades at a time on long trading voyages.

Borlund is prone to extensive volcanism which has resulted in spectacular natural features. These include a sea kept at boiling temperatures by active volcanic vents and a mountain range whose peaks extend beyond the atmosphere. Its thin atmosphere is human-breathable due to chemical reactions in most of the native plant life, which aggressively seeks and incorporates elements toxic to many lifeforms, including humans. The concentration of these chemicals means that most plant and animal life is toxic to offworld species, including humans.

Borlund has numerous bodies of water, some of which appear to be craters caused by ancient meteor strikes.
Its single true ocean is surrounded on three sides by volcanic-ridged land masses, with near-vertical walls of burnt rock rising out of the water. The fourth side starts as a black sand beach gradually giving way to low plains covered in springy ground cover. The plains end in a deep rift valley, the result of a 4,000-year-

old earthquake. On the other side of the rift is a high plateau, where plains were gradually lifted up 100 kilometres over the last 200 million years. Here, the ground cover is spongy rather than springy.

Plant life on cliffs and ridges evolved to compete for sunlight by clinging to near-vertical surfaces and growing outward in wide, flat shelves. Complicated root structures use enzyme catalysts to bore slowly into the rock to anchor the plants, leaching chemicals directly from metabolised stone. New plants may require centuries to root. Once established, plants grow outward at an astonishing rate.

The Lurent of Borlund evolved in a milieu of competition for high ground along the base of cliff-plant ledges.
Low gravity combined with the efficient use of vertical space allowed the population to grow with few major interruptions by war or disease, reaching billions before space travel was developed. The colonization of their home system saw the population boom into the tens of billions as gigantic planetoids were gathered and moved into the habitable zone to drive industry, agriculture and engineering. Concentrated raiding by Vargr corsairs spurred development of defensive technology and in time Vargr learned to avoid the Borlund system.

Since the coming of the Third Imperium, the Lurent have periodically launched expeditions to nearby worlds thought to harbour corsairs. Mercenary forces are always used, although they may be transported aboard Lurent starships. Expeditions are launched no more often than one every few years but when one is being prepared the mercenary marketplace across the sector can be

affected. The Lurent do not do things by halves when it comes to suppressing piracy.

GZIGORLLOE Gzigorlloe is a moon of the gas giant Zukou. Its trace atmosphere provides little or no protection from meteorites and cannot prevent the temperature plunging at night. During the day, chemicals can be seen subliming off the surface of Gzigorlloe’s ice lakes, although the temperature does not stay warm enough to have liquid water for long.

Gzigorlloe was colonized by a number of Vargr corsair bands, each of which created its own stronghold far from the others. Some settlements grew large enough to develop some industry, usually supported by local mining, but for the most part were bases rather than homelands. Gzigorlloe gained a reputation as a ‘corsair moon’ for a time, until the Imperial Navy launched a series of major assaults in the late 1090s. One-by-one, the corsair bases were smashed, some so badly that they were never repopulated.

Today, the remaining settlements are run by Vargr gangs, some of which are involved in smuggling or piracy but on a much smaller scale than before. Each settlement has its own small spaceport of sorts and there are no overland links between communities; space vessels or grav vehicles are used for what little contact they have with one another. The central starport is regularly fought over or subject to surprise landgrab attempts, making it an unhealthy place to visit.

## ANTRA

### DENEB-SUBSECTOR C

Like the neighboring Lamas subsector, Antra is a border region, with nine of its 25 worlds lying outside the Imperium. Economically, the subsector is not well developed and often considered to be somewhere to be passed through or bypassed altogether rather than a destination for goods or investment. This situation is not improved by the difficult conditions in Lamas, to spinward.

Antra is astrographically scattered. Although stellar density is not unusually low, there are no large mains or clusters to create favourable conditions for trade.
The largest local cluster is connected to the subsector capital, Antra itself, but lies mostly in Lamas with all the difficulties that entails. The handful of Imperial worlds around Ostov are connected to a main running into non-

aligned space to coreward but are too underdeveloped to take advantage of cross-border trade opportunities.
Indeed, these worlds are more a liability than an asset as they offer an easy route into the Imperium for smugglers, corsairs and carpetbaggers hoping to make a big score in the chaotic economic environment of the subsector.

The central part of the subsector is devoid of stars, creating a barrier to rapid communications and interstellar commerce. The systems to trailing are likewise also cut off from most of Million by another rift.
Thus, the political and economic leaders of Antra tend to think in terms of the strip of worlds along the rimward end of the subsector, with everything beyond essentially out of reach. This is not a universal mindset; there are

ANTRA SUBSECTOR

### Deneb

### C

Lines is one of the few unregulated areas of life on Antra. After all, whenever a lunatic theory takes hold of the popular imagination, a few million tourist Credits come into Antra’s coffers.

As a result of this free-for-all, a number of myths exist about Antra. The reality is fairly mundane; Antra is an important and rich world, the seat of the subsector duke, with a booming tourist sector. Its capital is a hotbed of political intrigue, with ambassadors from other duchies and corporate officials entrenched in heavily-guarded embassies. Anyone of note arriving at the capital can expect to be cordially invited to parties, receptions or just a friendly meeting with one or more of these officials and then the manoeuvring starts.
Everyone wants to manipulate the other players to their advantage; anyone of note might be a useful pawn in the game of sector politics. The situation is similar at other ducal seats in the sector but Antra is particularly rife with political gamesmanship. Reliable information is hard to obtain and no-one’s motives are clear.

REMSEN Remsen’s atmosphere is uncomfortably dense and combined with its large areas of surface water this creates near-permanent thick cloud cover. ‘To rain like on Remsen’ is a figure of speech on several local worlds, and not without good reason. There is no such thing as drizzle or mist on this world; rain can best be described as big lumps of water falling from the sky, whilst fog renders even walking hazardous.

The world is heavily balkanised, as a result of the population dwelling in widely dispersed city-states.
Conflict between communities is uncommon, not least due to their separation, but rivalries exist in areas as diverse as sport, trade and art. Offworlders are sometimes puzzled at just how excited citizens of a city-
state can get because an artist from their community has been awarded a prize or simply produced something better than his arch-rival from another city.

These rivalries extend to trade in a way not entirely connected with making money. Revenue is always welcome but a city-state that makes more from trade or tourism than another will value the money more as an indicator of victory over a rival. The people of Remsen are friendly to offworlders but in their eagerness to get one over other communities, may forget their manners or become offended at outsiders who will not comply with their plans.

a few outward-looking corporations and small shipping lines that work hard to create trade links coreward to the border. The difficulties they face suggest that conventional wisdom is based upon at least a half-
decent appraisal of the situation.

Antra is protected by the 151st fleet, which has a higher than usual allocation of high-jump couriers and fast-response vessels to help secure distant parts of the subsector. This is a mixed blessing; the sector commander routinely borrows these assets to undertake missions elsewhere and it is not uncommon for returning ships to be shortstopped by other commanders to deal with problems in their locality. As a result, the 151 st Fleet is chronically understrength and has lost its best assets but on paper it looks very capable. This makes getting replacements or even just securing the return of borrowed vessels a difficult business.

ANTRA Antra is a subsector capital and important link on the x-boat network. It is renowned for its Worldroof, an experimental construction of hexagonal cells supported by towers, intended to create a sheltered and partially controlled environment, increasing air pressure to more comfortable levels and eliminating the worst effects of weather. The cells act as solar collectors and, along with wind-powered generators, provide much of the world’s electricity.

The Worldroof is visually spectacular but scientifically even more impressive. A large museum at the downport explains the science and technology behind the construction and maintenance of the Worldroof, taking pains to ensure visitors understand just how staggeringly expensive and difficult it was to create.

Antra has another well-known tourist attraction, the so-
called Black Lines; lines, curves and shapes etched on the bedrock of some areas. They appear to be artificial and are visible from low orbit but although there are many hypotheses about their origins and meaning, little is truly known about them. Nevertheless, people come from far and wide to visit the Black Lines. Some are taken in by charlatans pretending to be scientists with an explanation of the phenomenon and whilst the government officially disapproves of sell-out lectures by fake scientists, it does little to curb the practice as it generates revenue; speculation (usually presented as fact, or as ‘shocking revelations the mainstream science community doesn’t want you to know’) about the Black

## MILLION

### DENEB-SUBSECTOR D

Eleven of the Million subsector’s twenty-two star systems lie within the Imperial border, most part of a central chain running out of the Imperium to coreward.
At the rimward end of the chain lies Taproban, which acts as a trade hub for worlds to coreward.

The astrography of Million, along with its proximity to Vargr states, made colonization and subsequent economic expansion a difficult proposition.
Communication with the Khouth subsector in Corridor requires jump-3 vessels, or a long jump-2 transit to rimward or outside Imperial space to coreward. The x-boat route running along the border from Khouth ensures that data travels quickly but goods and commercial ships tend not to enter the subsector from that direction.

Communications with Antra, to spinward, are equally difficult, making Vargr worlds to coreward the best trading partners for the central worlds of Million.
Politics does not always permit this however, so the most reliable markets are found to rimward, in Atsah.
Indeed, Million is to a great extent an extension of Atsah and not a very important one at that; although Million has a subsector administration of sorts, most policy decisions are made on Atsah and there is a long history of putting Million a distant second. As a result, raw materials and low-value goods flow rimward, with industrial and luxury items imported into Million at premium prices. This has further stunted the economic growth of the region and ensured its economies remain dependent on those of Atsah.

MILLION SUBSECTOR

### Deneb

### D

The 61st Fleet, assigned to Million, is optimised for dealing with small-scale incursions by Vargr corsairs; if ‘optimised’ is the right word. The fleet is used as a dumping-ground for obsolescent vessels and ‘plodder’
officers and spends most of its time on routine patrols in the systems around Taproban. Vessels are typically old, small and in need of maintenance, with spares of all kinds in short supply.

Cross-border operations are carried out by far better vessels assigned to Sector Fleet command and deployed in the subsector when needed. These ships show the flag and dash back and forth across the border to deal with crises, leaving the subsector fleet to enforce customs regulations and mount sensor watches over backwater worlds. The 61st Fleet shows up poorly in joint exercises and their Sector Fleet colleagues are not kind about it.
Real resentment is growing among the personnel of this force, although as yet it manifests only as poor morale and even poorer performance.

495-524 495-524 is an unclaimed and virtually uninhabited world, although it has the potential to support large-
scale settlement. Its starport is hardly worthy of the name, being little more than a landing field located next to the world’s only settlement. It is not clear exactly why this facility was set-up, but there is a known Ancients site a few kilometres away. It may be that 495-524 was settled by hopeful artefact-hunters but today the port is a small frontier town with virtually no industry. About half the inhabitants have ‘always been there’, as they put it, and call the town home. The rest are transients or have nowhere better to go.

The Ancients site is widely known but apparently picked clean many years ago. It consists of a set of tunnels running into a cliff face, with chambers deep inside the rock. They were emptied of anything movable long ago and whilst the occasional rumor surfaces of a hidden entrance to ‘the rest of the ruin’ these tales inevitably turn out to be false. The main importance of the ruin is that it brings bright-eyed greenhorns into the port from time-to-time, who can be fleeced by local guides offering lost secrets and great riches.

The world has a reasonable amount of mineral wealth and prospectors are not uncommon. The surface is pockmarked with the collapsed remains of strip-mines where offworld companies have moved in for a year or two, ripped everything out of an easily accessed vein of ore, then simply packed up and left. There are also rumored to be small settlements hidden away in obscure corners of the globe, home to corsairs, smugglers and outlaws.

FEL Fel lies just outside the Imperial border, within the territory claimed by the United Followers of Augurgh. It is unusually steadfast in its support of the UFA which, combined with its importance as a source of industrial goods, makes it an extremely significant asset to the alliance. Fel maintains a small but effective system defence flotilla, backed up by a standing deployment of the UFA Navy. The infighting among captains and senior commanders within the fleet elements deployed to Fel rarely spills over into local politics but all the same Fel’s government has openly stated that it would prefer the fleet to go and bicker somewhere else.

This is unlikely to happen, since the UFA feels the need to demonstrate its naval capabilities and Fel is a good place to be seen. Its high-standard port sees considerable trade from Imperial worlds as well as local systems, and several Imperial corporations are active on Fel or at its port. The UFA leadership considers that reminding the Imperium and surrounding worlds that they have a navy – of sorts –
is necessary and will sometimes concentrate almost the entire available force off Fel just to make a point.

Fel itself is not a welcoming world. It has an unbreathable exotic atmosphere and its ecosystem is saturated with heavy metals and other toxic minerals.
This makes food production a problem – Fel relies heavily on imports – but it does support an extensive mining and mineral-extraction sector. This in turn feeds the world’s industry, which produces goods for export across the subsector and the territory of the UFA.

Fel also builds starships, mostly commercial ships or freighters, but Fel is a primary shipyard for the UFA and produces a range of vessels ranging from fighters through escorts to the occasional cruiser. Some vessels go to less than reputable operators and whilst Fel does not openly build corsairs for pirate bands some of its ‘well-armed merchant ship’ designs are distinctly paramilitary. Fel has been known to issue Letters of Marque to the operators of these vessels although it normally distances itself from activities of corsair bands in order to maintain the façade of a civilised power. This is important if the world wishes to avoid a raid in force by the Imperial Navy.

Fel’s cities are mainly underground and tend to be focussed on an industrial or mining centre with supporting infrastructure. Some structures protrude above ground level and are either pressurised or protected by a dome, however the majority are fully underground. Living quarters would be considered claustrophobic by most humans but public spaces like parks are large and well-kept.

The Khoeurrroe-class Armed Merchant Vessel is constructed at TL10 and designed to be capable of two successive jumps, with enough in-system thrust to ensure timely cargo delivery and armament to deter interference. It is the ideal vessel for secure freight delivery or service as a naval auxiliary. At least, so says its official design registry.

The Khoeurrroe-class is heavily armed for a merchant ship and has sufficient acceleration to chase down most commercial vessels. Its heavy torpedo armament is inefficient when attacking a small vessel but often a single torpedo fired as a warning will ensure compliance with the Khoeurrroe captain’s requests. Several features are described with polite euphemisms; the heavy-duty cargo crane and forced linkage apparatus are ‘attractive to the salvage and rescue market’ whilst the armories and brig are ‘secure transportation for passengers and high-value cargo’.

In reality, this vessel is only viable as a corsair or in a subsidised role such as providing escort to other merchants – the other side of the corsair coin. Its cargo capacity is inadequate for standard freighting and even if the crew take double-occupancy, the passenger accommodation is very small – unless of course the brig is actually used to transport people.

On-planet food production is industrial and mostly based on yeast products. These are palatable enough but not satisfying for the soul and many of the world’s Vargr population spend a significant part of their income on imported food. One useful, if perhaps odd, distraction from the local food is hunting. Indoor game preserves do exist, although membership and licenses are very expensive. For most Vargr so inclined, the cheaper option of outdoor hunting offers at least the feeling of having chased real food. The local wildlife is so full of toxic chemicals that it is inedible but tucking into a plate of yeast-extract and noodles is somehow more satisfying after a successful hunt.

The world government is surprisingly stable, considering it is made up of a great many Vargr clans. As might be expected, personalities play a big part in governance and affairs of the planetary senate can be violent. Even when there is no outright conflict there is always a lot of noise and posturing in the senate, with threats and denunciations commonplace. Consensus is usually achieved and the end result is a stable society but the methods by which this is achieved can be vigorous.

GABRAEL Located close to Taproban in the central cluster of Million, Gabrael is to a great extent a typical Imperial world. About 1.2 million of its four million citizens are Vargr but all are Imperial citizens first and foremost. The world is rather dry and has a tainted atmosphere, which prevented it from ever being an attractive destination for settlement. In fact, the orbital starport is the world’s main source of revenue and far more important than the planet itself.

The highport is owned and operated by Ling-Standard Products (LSP), which runs the facility as a wholly owned subsidiary and rents space to other businesses.
The port has a repair-and-maintenance contract with the subsector fleet, although this is mostly restricted to minor repairs on small escort vessels. The shipyards mainly produce small merchant and commercial vessels of a sort used by many clients throughout the subsector.
These are often armed for self-defence, given the world’s location close to the border and many clients ask for their ships to be upgunned as tensions rise.

The highport generates a great deal of revenue from trade and shipbuilding but only a small proportion reaches the planetary government. Some of this is taxation and although LSP pays only a very small percentage to its hosting government, this still forms most of the income of a world with a population of four million. Some purchases are also made, notably foodstuffs from the belt of industrial farms around the downport.

Visitors could be forgiven for thinking that Gabrael has pretensions of being an agricultural world but only a small area is intensively farmed. This provides more than enough food for the population and sale to the highport operators.
Most craft based at the downport are agricultural haulage shuttles, with few passenger and cargo vessels.

The downport has minimal facilities, serving mainly as a transfer port for agricultural goods. The world’s startown is located around 20km away, outside the immediate farming belt. It is reached by a fast and efficient rail service and caters to offworld visitors as well as acting as the centre of government. Around 500,000 people dwell in the startown or immediately around it, with the remainder of the population living in small cities wherever there are resources and sufficient water.

IKHABA Located right on the Imperial border with the United Followers of Augurgh, Ikhaba is a world of little importance except as a buffer against UFA influence.
The 900,000 or so inhabitants have a mature TL8 society that cannot compete economically with nearby high-tech industrial worlds. Considerable amounts of food are shipped across the border to Fel in return for industrial goods, with Ikhaba very much the junior partner in the relationship.

This situation has been used as a rallying cry by various factions. Investment (by whatever faction is being denounced for not doing it) in worlds like Ikhaba would prevent Imperial systems becoming poor relations to powerful foreigners or so say those who do not have to fund it. At present, there are no practical reasons for sinking vast sums into backwater worlds in order to bring them up to high-tech standards and Imperial pride does not translate into freighters full of cash. Thus Ikhaba and worlds like it continue to get by without any real chance of development.

Ikhaba has a corporate government; in this case literally. The World Corporation of Ikhaba was founded specifically to oversee colonization of the planet and has governed it ever since. Whilst not a charismatic or inspiring organization, the worldcorp does an effective job of enforcing liberal laws and keeping the street lights on and the population are content due, perversely perhaps, to agitation by proponents of the UFA.
Whilst the UFA has won over a small segment of the population, the majority have gone the other way. There is a greater sense of national identity on Ikhaba now than has existed in the past.

Some of the more radical factions within the UFA have tried to sway opinion on Ikhaba by direct means but violence, intimidation and attacks on shipping have resulted in a further hardening of opinion against the alliance. Ikhaba’s liberal weapon ownership laws have permitted the formation of highly unofficial militias, which occasionally clash with UFA-sponsored groups.
The subsector fleet has also stepped up patrols in the system to deter attacks on shipping.

TALON Talon is located a couple of parsecs from the Imperial border and forms part of the United Followers of Augurgh. Like the alliance itself, Talon is anything but united. Its states merge and split, with factions sometimes forming a quasi-state that somehow manages to exist alongside the local government for a time. The population consists of around 200 million Vargr and 1.8 billion Souggvuez, the native people of Talon. The two species are intermixed and have formed a united culture.

The first Vargr came to Talon around -300, fleeing disaster in their homelands. Theirs was a large-
scale migration but not an invasion as such. Instead,
the spacefaring Vargr found kindred spirits in the Souggvuez, who at the time had an atomic-era culture.
The Vargr were more energetic – some might say pushy – than the indigenous population and made themselves a niche in the upper echelons of society.
These distinctions gradually eroded over time and today there really is little distinction between a Vargr and a Souggvuez citizen of Talon.

Talon has a sufficiently large economy that it exerts influence on both sides of the border and routinely hosts Imperial trade ships up from Taproban and even Atsah.
Its ambassadors are major players in the politics of the local worlds, although their efforts to show the Imperials just how important they are tend to come off as noisy posturing for its own sake.

One characteristic of Talon’s complex government system is that everything is done by committee, including interstellar affairs. When disagreements reach an impasse, the usual result is some variation on the theme of conflict. Skirmishing and corsair raids are more common than all-out war but it does happen from time-
to-time. The frequency of these breakdowns is such that Talon is locked in a cycle of growth and destruction.

The Sabine subsector contains 27 star systems, all members of the Imperium. Sixteen of these worlds are part of a jump-1 cluster sprawling across Sabine and Inar, with all of the economic benefits this entails.
Not all these worlds are well developed however and the presence of two interdicted systems does tend to channel jump-1 traffic into local patterns. The remainder of the subsector contains mostly underdeveloped worlds, which provide a jump-2 link to Rhylanor in the Marches but otherwise are of little importance.

These backwater worlds are of small interest to major economies so long as merchant traffic is not impeded and are of low strategic importance to the Imperium as a whole. There is thus little regulation of corporate activity in the region and away from the immediate environs of the starport many worlds might as well not be part of Imperium at all. These systems are prone to piracy and raiding, which provokes a response from the subsector fleet and Imperial authorities when it reaches a serious level.

SABINE SUBSECTOR

### Deneb

### E

The x-boat route to Rhylanor, by way of Fennec, has long been contentious. A message from Magash to Rhylanor takes a minimum of five weeks; more if it goes by every link on the chain. A link using the existing scout service base at Bevey in the Rhylanor subsector would cut this to three weeks, with messages reaching the naval base at Jae Tellona in two. Funding is not the problem; the cost would not be great. Yet despite endless lobbying, the existing route remains in place for reasons rooted in regional politics.

The 195th Fleet is assigned to Sabine but concentrates most of its efforts on the primary cluster. It has no bases in the backwater region to spinward and maintains only a patchy presence. Operations are often on a
‘fire brigade’ basis, with task forces concentrated at Thengin then sent into a system to clean it up. This works for a time but is no substitute for a steady, visible presence as it tends to push troubles around instead of eliminating them.

Opinions vary about this approach. It is easy to show, in terms of hard numbers, that securing the main trade

lanes justifies tax credits spent on the fleet better than sitting over remote low-population worlds. However, there are those who are adamant the fleet is being kept out of the region to allow illicit business to thrive.

AMRITSAR Amritsar has an uncomfortably dense atmosphere, which has the effect of making its taint more serious.
The starport is built on high ground where atmospheric pressure is a little lower but the thick, warm air is still uncomfortable and most people prefer to remain inside air-conditioned buildings.

Amritsar is primarily notable for its ruins, generally assumed to date from the Ancients period, and have been the subject of several publicly available books and vid documentaries. Occasionally a new wild theory emerges and the datanet is flooded with ‘shocking revelations Ancients scientists don’t want you to know’
but these rarely amount to more than a sales pitch for a questionably researched publication or rather basic attempt to increase advertising revenue.

ARA PACIS Ara Pacis is the most important of a small cluster of four worlds in the spinward-rimward corner of Sabine. It is a link on the jump-2 route between Thengin and Mora, and is sometimes marketed as ‘the last good port before Mora’. As such, Ara Pacis sees a considerable amount of through traffic and makes a great deal of profit from interstellar trade.

The highport is independent of any of Ara Pacis’ nations and owned by the Count of Ara Pacis, who has an extensive ‘estate’ within the orbital structure in addition to his fief on-planet. It is not unusual for the Imperial nobility to own business assets, although being the owner-operator of an entire starport is not common. This arrangement provides the count with a large income and also distances him from the affairs of Ara Pacis’
independent settlements.

Whilst the highport is quite impressive, Ara Pacis itself is not. A small world largely covered in water, it has only primitive life on land. This is largely due to the very thin atmosphere, which has not prevented the oceans from developing their own ecosystem. This includes some very large ‘sea monsters’ and huge number of lesser creatures. Kelp farming is a major industry on Ara Pacis, with produce shipped offworld aboard bulk freighters.

Ara Pacis is balkanised, although with a population of only six million this does not mean quite the same as on a world with several high-population nations. In the case of Ara Pacis, balkanization means there are several small cities, each independent of the others.
Communications between the cities are poor; indeed there are a couple that might as well be on another planet for all the interaction they have with their neighbors. All cities have their own downport, from which shuttles provide a regular service to the orbital port.

The cities were founded in areas with good natural resources, most of them as ‘corp towns’ by mining companies. Over time, these frontier settlements developed into cities in their own right but some still show the legacy of initial haphazard growth. The mining companies were not unduly worried about the long-term development of what were essentially expedient places for workers to live and facilities were added as needed or when funds permitted, resulting in a messy layout confuses visitors and even some residents.

There are six known sites on Amritsar. Each takes the form of a ring of broken crystal pylons around a plaza of resilient dark stone-like material. Four of the plazas are in reasonably good condition; two are weed-choked and riddled with cracks and gaps. No energy signatures have been detected and there do not appear to be any additional structures nearby. The purpose of these sites is unknown.

ANOMALY FIVE Anomaly Five is Red Zoned, potentially causing problems for jump-1 traffic in the local cluster as there is no alternative route to Thengin and Magash, a problem solved by the presence of an orbital fuelling station around the system’s outermost gas giant. This custom-built installation is not a starport and does not welcome visitors. It is manned by civilians on contract to the Imperial Navy and protected by a small fighter detachment based at one end of the station.
Ships passing through the neighboring systems are directed to the station and warned that approaching the
‘mainworld’ is forbidden.

Anomaly Five is a small moon of the innermost gas giant, designated the system’s mainworld in the 400s.
It was Red Zoned in the 690s, essentially forbidding the whole system to unauthorized traffic. This was an unusual measure, especially given the system’s location on a jump-1 link. The Imperial Navy does not discuss the reasons for the interdiction but maintains a standing patrol at all times. This varies from a handful of escorts to a destroyer, and occasionally an old cruiser is assigned to watch Anomaly Five for a few weeks. Challenges to vessels violating the Red Zone are robust, involving at the very least a boarding and close questioning. The navy has shown willing to fire on those who do not provide a reason for their presence.

The Imperial authorities deny rumors that secret research is being undertaken on the surface of Anomaly Five and most records of the initial surveys have been expunged. However, there is some evidence that early planetologists found large mass concentrations deep under the surface of Anomaly Five. Speculation ranges from incredible Ancient wonders awaiting discovery (as always) to deposits of superheavy elements. Whatever the truth may be, the Imperium is keen to ensure that nobody gets too close to Anomaly Five, though whose protection this is for remains a mystery.

MAGASH Magash is a forbidding rockball world but in a system with no habitable planets one ball of rock is as good as another. Magash was located a convenient distance from the system’s primary and its close companion star, so was chosen as the system’s mainworld. Ease of navigation was not the only factor in the selection; Magash had good natural resources that facilitated early development.

Magash was intended from the outset to be a major industrial centre and received heavy investment; incentives were offered to persuade colonists to move to the underground cities of Magash rather than one of the more pleasant worlds in the region. This was not a single-world project; Magash was to be the hub of industry in the surrounding systems, creating a self-
supporting expansion program.

Although the project was not a total success, Magash did indeed develop into a high-tech manufacturing centre and was soon exporting machinery and equipment to developing colonies on nearby worlds. It then became the seat of the Duke of Sabine when the subsector’s senior nobility were appointed.

Magash has few structures visible above ground and the population of around eight billion are housed within city-
complexes dispersed around the globe. Although each has the identity of a single city, they are built in a chain of artificial caverns. Each has its own amenities and can function independently in the event of disaster cutting off power or water supplies, although not all have access to the surface. Some cavern-cities within a complex are specialist areas, including the ducal city and several hazardous-materials handling facilities, but most are a large and diversified city in their own right, forming a module within each larger city-complex.

Each city-complex is self-governing and has its own spaceport. In addition, there are specialist ports dotted all over the surface. Incoming traffic from other systems goes by way of the excellent orbital port, with most visitors and traders never descending to the world itself.
Some in-system traffic uses the highport but bulk ore carriers and chemical tankers instead operate out of a second orbital port dedicated to such large commercial vessels. From there, materials are transferred groundside by an armada of interface shuttles.

Magash’s outsystem industry uses a curious set-up dating from the early expansion, whereby each of the major city-complexes was given responsibility for the development of a segment of the system. The two planetoid belts are subdivided into zones, each feeding ore and minerals into the industrial sector of a single city-complex. Mines on the moons of the system’s gas giants and terrestrial worlds are likewise controlled and operated from their assigned city-complex, as are chemical extraction rigs skimming hydrocarbons from the four gas giants.

The Magash system is thus a hive of activity, with extraction operations feeding into the commercial port then down to the city-complexes and finished goods leaving the system by way of the main highport.
The commercial spacing sector alone outnumbers the population of some worlds and not surprisingly is protected by a large in-system patrol force. Magash itself is protected by several deep-site meson gun emplacements and a force of heavily armored monitors.

The scout base at Magash orbits the mainworld and is the local reserve vessel repository. In addition to x-boats and survey craft, large numbers of specialist vessels and additional couriers are held at the base, ready to respond to sudden need. These include jump-6 fast couriers used to convey urgent messages between government centres in an emergency. The Duke of Sabine applies constant pressure to borrow these ships but the Scout Service has thus far resisted.

Orbital traffic over Magash is nightmarishly complex.
perhaps one reason why the Imperial Navy chose to locate regional bases elsewhere. The navy does visit, of course, and routinely puts a cruiser through the highport every few weeks to show the flag.

THENGIN Lying towards the spinward end of Deneb’s largest cluster-main, Thengin is economically and strategically important, with additional income provided by the naval base. ‘Navy money’ takes the form of grants and large-
scale contracts but also the very significant individual spending of crew on liberty at Thengin’s starport. Navy and marine uniforms are commonplace in the port and surrounding cities and personnel in general are well received.

Thengin has a good relationship with the navy, with serving a hitch seen as a route into a good job even by those with no aspirations towards a military career.
Employers look favourably upon ex-naval personnel, with the result that Thengin has a large population of immigrants who finished their final term at Thengin’s naval base and settled nearby.

The megacorporation GSbAG has always been heavily involved in Thengin’s economy, funding the original small naval base and its supporting colony in the early 300s, with a view to securing the region and enabling further colonization. Starships are not built at Thengin, although there are smallcraft yards that specialise in fighters and assault shuttles. GSbAG maintains extensive components factories in several of Thengin’s cities, some constructing highly classified items using imported materials, although most make mundane items like hull armor plate or fuel piping. Ex-naval personnel are favoured for the more sensitive sites but there is still plenty of work available and GSbAG is popular among the citizens.

VANZETI Vanzeti is a water world with a very thin atmosphere and four moons. As a result, it suffers from rapid changes of temperature and extreme tides. Fog is very common, impeding travel and quite often interfering with routine operations at the starport but more caution is required for the ‘wallstorms’, giant walls of seawater travelling around the globe. These lie somewhere between fog, extremely heavy rain and a vaporous suspension, dragged along by the gravity of the moons. When a wallstorm arrives, it dumps large quantities of water on everything in its path but is not directly damaging due to the thinness of the world’s atmosphere. Wallstorms make using conventional compressor masks risky as intakes can fill and drown the user.

Vanzeti’s population is almost entirely restricted to the chains of islands around the starport region. The numerous small towns are all very similar; run-down and anything but prosperous. A long time ago Vanzeti was colonized at these locations but the machinery wore out and promised follow-up missions did not arrive. The population made the best of it but over the years Vanzeti became notorious as a place nobody would settle by choice. Those that end up there are usually trying to get away or hiding from something. An unlucky few are passing through and simply get stuck on Vanzeti. As a

stop on the Thengin-Mora jump-2 route, Vanzeti’s port sees a reasonable amount of passing traffic but most ships simply refuel and move on without conducting trade.

Vanzeti’s only real industry is starship ‘refurbishment and upgrade’, a term that can have various meanings.
Representatives of the world’s ruling elite can be encountered on almost every world within 20 parsecs, offering a low but not completely unreasonable price for old and worn-out starships. Few questions are asked and it is widely assumed that Vanzeti buys pirated and stolen vessels, as well as ships that have become uneconomical to operate.

Most ships are broken for spares but a few are rebuilt as working vessels, often involving a mishmash of whatever components – including hull sections – are available.
The buyer really needs to be aware when dealing with the shipwrights of Vanzeti but every ship they sell is spaceworthy. It is also possible to obtain custom upgrades, although this depends very much on whether the right parts and components are available. ‘Custom upgrade’ in this context usually means either additional weaponry or a modification that would not be carried out by a more reputable shipyard.

Some upgraded vessels are operated by the system defence flotilla, a poorly trained but generally effective force loyal to the ruling elite. Whilst too small to pose a threat to a real warship, these ships are more than adequate for dealing with the occasional corsair. Some can be encountered in nearby systems, carrying out missions for their owners or a client whose identity they prefer not to reveal.

Vanzeti has a scout base, located on a remote island and with little interaction with the world population. The Scout Service is rather vague about what this installation and its personnel are doing but it is generally thought that Vanzeti’s atmospheric conditions were sufficiently unusual to merit building a facility to study them and once in operation the base was maintained ‘just in case’. Few vessels are granted permission to land at the installation but those that do find it operated by a skeleton staff who seem to do little more than keep the base in working order. It is possible – likely, even – that the scouts collect data on the activities of the world population and their ship conversion industry, feeding it back to Imperial intelligence services aboard regular supply vessels.

## INAR

### DENEB-SUBSECTOR F

The 36 star systems of Inar lie entirely within the Imperium, with most forming part of a large concentration sprawling across both Inar and Sabine.
Inar itself, the subsector capital, is not part of this

concentration but has easy jump-2 access to it by way of Pecena. Indeed, jump-2 communications with the rest of the sector and beyond are good.

### Deneb F

Inar’s industrial and economic strength arises in part from these fortunate astrographic circumstances and partly from the industrial power of its major worlds.
Foremost among these are Starn, Liiri and Kubishush, all of which lie within Inar’s inner sphere of influence.

Inar is a candidate for sector capital, a fact its duke is keen to remind everyone of. The Duchy of Inar is the most powerful political faction in the sector, well ahead of its rivals Atsah and Vincennes, and is constantly at odds with the latter. Usually this is nothing more serious than economic and political one-upmanship, but local politics can become vicious and have at times led to proxy wars being fought between the two subsector dukes.

It is probable that at some point the Emperor will appoint one of the Dukes of Deneb as sector duke, with authority over the subsector duchies. Whilst in the long term this might strengthen the sector economically and provide greater security, any such move would be so vigorously contested that it would be counterproductive in the short to medium term. Thus the present situation is allowed to continue even though it is not at all good for the region as a whole.

An Imperial Navy Depot is located on the trailing side of Inar, close to the astrographical centre of the sector.
The depot is home to the Deneb Fleet, benefiting the local economy with its voracious need for high-tech components. The subsector fleet – the 257th – has its headquarters at Inar and works closely with the subsector duke but the sector fleet, on the other hand, tries to stay out of local politics. In this, it has mixed success. All major nobles in the sector have representatives at headquarters, who press for assets to be assigned to their regions or compete for naval contracts to benefit their subsector’s businesses.

ASHASI Ashasi has the highest population in the subsector despite it being a hell-hole with a highly dense atmosphere. Its underground cities are overpopulated and run-down for the most part, although the ruling elite live in splendour, a result of natural decline and economic downturn, coupled with self-serving decisions.

Ashashi was the subject of a ‘gold rush’ during early Imperial expansion into the sector, after the discovery of large deposits of both basic and rare minerals.
Some deposits were extensive, enabling large-scale extraction that opened up artificial caverns, which could have destabilized the surface above if not filled in or supported. Instead, they were extended and expanded, with structures built as both supports and living places.

As extraction efforts spread out and down from the original caverns, people moved in and began operating ore processing facilities and factories. These were naturally followed by shops, theatres and all manner of small businesses. One-by-one, the worked-out caverns were filled with people enjoying a good standard of living beneath the surface of their unpleasant world.

The good times went on for centuries, with Ashashi’s extensive mineral exports and smaller quantities of finished goods funding expansion into new areas of the planet. Eventually, however, it became necessary to delve ever deeper to find viable deposits and production costs rose with each expansion. Ashasi enjoyed a renaissance based upon selling vast amounts of redundant mining and ore-processing equipment but this money was not spent wisely and when it was gone there was no prospect of transitioning to a different economic sector.

Today, Ashasi is run-down and insular, its starport allowed to decay to the point where it is barely worthy of the name. The populace are kept in line by a combination of propaganda and force, and the depressed economy helps the dictator maintain his popularity. Strict control of the job market and flow of consumer goods allows the elite to reward loyalty and punish those who do not toe the line.
A constant diet of propaganda paints the situation as a difficult time that the world can get through if everyone pulls together and vilifies dissidents as undermining the chances of recovery.

At present, enough of the populace are on board that dissent is low-key and easily dealt with but as conditions worsen and no sign of recovery presents itself there is a real danger that Ashasi’s society may rip itself apart.
The Imperial authorities are aware of the situation but do not want to get involved in a potentially complex and dangerous situation. Besides, the Imperium does not involve itself in the politics of individual worlds unless intervention is necessary. At present, the troubles brewing on Ashasi do not threaten any other world or the security of the Imperium as a whole, so they remain the problem of the world’s population. No Imperial noble or official wants to stake his career on a solution that has little chance of working.

INAR Inar is a tidally locked rockball planet, with one face permanently baked by its primary and the other exposed to the cold of space. Its trace atmosphere does nothing to alleviate the harsh conditions. It was colonized, like many similar worlds, for administrative and economic reasons, and targeted for rapid expansion of its mining and industrial sectors.

As a hub for local development, Inar was a logical choice for an administrative centre and was eventually named as the subsector capital. Its population stabilized at around 90 million a long time ago, with the vast majority of permanent citizens dwelling in subterranean cities. There are some surface settlements, most of which are mining towns whose local population is supplemented by large numbers of contracted workers and their families. These are not counted among the world’s population in most databases as they are workers, not residents.

As the seat of the subsector duke, Inar attracts petitioners, business representatives and hangers-on in large numbers. These are received at the Duke of Inar’s orbital station, built at his own expense – sort of – as a subsector capital that was ‘in the subsector rather than on the planet’. Supposedly this was a symbol of the duke’s commitment to the affairs of his whole area of interest but the reality is more complex than that.

The orbital station is very grand and whilst it was indeed begun using the duke’s own funds most of the money came from the Imperial Navy’s budget. A political masterstoke enabled the duke to co-locate his orbital palace with the navy’s projected base for the system.
As a result, part of the orbital fortress is private and controlled by the duke whilst most of it – including the heavy defences that all major naval installations have

- is staffed by the navy. Essentially, the Duke of Inar

conned the navy into building his palace and protecting it for him.

This situation is not to the liking of the Imperial Navy, partially because of the way its funding board was maneuverd but mostly because it places the offices of Naval Intelligence and a number of senior naval officers within easy reach of a subsector duke who constantly interferes in what should be purely military matters, and who has no qualms about using the navy in his schemes.
The duke makes use of the naval maintenance facilities at the base for his own ships, which are based out of the same structure. Whilst this is irregular, his influence is such that the navy has to indulge him up to a point.
Again, the Duke of Inar is getting the navy to pay for his possessions, which causes friction with other nobles who are not so favoured. Naval attaches elsewhere find themselves defending this position, as the alternative is to acknowledge that they have been played by the duke.

Civilian traffic goes to the orbital starport, not the palace/naval base and only naval or ducal vessels may approach the palace. The port is extensive and

well equipped to handle high-volume trade but every merchant factor worth his salt knows that the ‘real business’ goes on at the palace. The orbital port’s business suites are fine for buying a few hundred tons of freight but if you want a big contract you have to get permission to set up an office at the palace, living the lifestyle and playing along with the duke’s pretentions of being the sector, not subsector, duke. This was of course the real plan behind the orbital palace. It is fit for a sector duke or even an archduke, if the post of Archduke of Deneb is ever created. Naturally, the Dukes of Inar each intend that honor to be theirs.

KUBISHUSH Kubishush is the homeworld of the Gl’lu, an unpleasant looking but friendly and cultured people who evolved despite the hostility of their world. Kubishush suffers from rampant volcanism, which is sufficiently bad that the Gl’lu language has multiple words for ‘destroyed by a volcano’. A Gl’lu can describe the exact circumstances and extent of damage, how long reconstruction or rehabitation will take and the likelihood of a repeat eruption in an impressive and grim shorthand that would be unnecessary elsewhere.

In addition, Kubishush has a corrosive atmosphere.
The Gl’lu evolved to use ammonia extracted from their planet’s atmosphere and require specialist life-support equipment when visiting other worlds. Part of the extensive orbital starport is set up for their needs but most is maintained in an environment suitable for other sentient races.

The port sees a lot of through-traffic but few visitors choose to land on Kubishush. Gl’lu spacecraft are designed to be resistant to their world’s atmosphere and regularly ply between port and surface, with fuel tankers especially important to the operation of the port; vast quantities of liquid hydrogen fuel are consumed by a working starport. Specialist vessels skim hydrocarbons from the system’s gas giant to provide a portion of the necessary fuel but most comes from plants on the surface, which process the world’s chemical-rich waters into useable fuel and other chemical compounds.

Gl’lu settlements are extremely resilient, both in terms of damage resistance and their ability to clear away wreckage and rebuild. This is a state of mind as well as physical capability; even the safest Gl’lu communities will sooner or later deal with severe disaster. Gl’lu can typically keep functioning amid a level of chaos that would inspire panic and despondency among humans.

MINDE’S STAR The Minde’s Star system is named, unusually, for its primary rather than its mainworld, because the
‘mainworld’ is inhabited only by Scout Service personnel and scientists studying the highly unusual star. Minde’s Star is a flare star that changes in brilliance in an unpredictable manner. Long study has allowed the scientific staff to establish rules of thumb allowing some forecasting of what might happen in the next hours, days and weeks but this is based on observations of the star rather than any mathematical model. No cycle or cycle-of-cycles has ever been identified.

The system is not considered hazardous enough to merit Amber Zone classification but very few vessels go there.
No significant trade is to be had at the starport and the needs of the 30 thousand or so inhabitants are met by regular supply runs. A handful of merchants visit from time-to-time, mainly selling luxury items to individuals or the scout station’s vendors. The occasional hopeful prospector vessel takes a look at a gas giant moon or one of the system’s rockball worlds but to date no find has been made worthy of the effort required to extract it.

MORNINGLORI Morninglori is named for its spectacular sky views.
The mainworld is a gas giant satellite, with the giant planet visible in the sky even in daytime. Reflected light from the giant makes true darkness very rare on Morninglori, although periods of very dim twilight occur every rotation. The day/twilight cycle is very rapid, making a traditional work in the day/rest at night lifestyle meaningless. The inhabitants’ lives are keyed

to artificial light indoors and clocks set to the standard Imperial day. Words like ‘tomorrow’ can confuse newcomers, as they can refer either to the standard Imperial day or the next full daylight period, depending on inflection and context.

Parts of Morninglori remain unexplored, with the 100 thousand or so population centered around the port and nearby small cities. Whilst a very pretty planet, Morninglori is unimportant in the grand scheme of sector politics. It ‘missed the boat’ during the early expansion of the region and today remains a backwater whose modest exports of agricultural goods are insufficient to buy the world a place on the interstellar stage. This is to the liking of most residents, who simply want to get on with their daily lives and let the universe go by.

OTOMISI Otomisi is a hostile world located within the sector’s largest cluster, important mainly for its chemical industry with few visitors descending to the surface other than for business. The high-quality orbital port sees a considerable volume of traffic but Otomisi’s balance of trade is very much skewed in the direction of specialist chemical exports and everything the population needs as imports.

Otomisi’s exotic atmosphere can become highly toxic under the right conditions, as chemicals are liberated from the ocean to form dense fogs. These roll over low ground and into valleys, making these regions hazardous to enter. However, this phenomenon also makes

extraction of chemical compounds relatively easy, so there are numerous installations along the coasts. These have a sealed environment, with workers trained in the use of protective equipment but receive few visitors.
Anyone who does not have to work in the toxic fogs of Otomisi chooses not to.

Not all areas are affected. High ground is generally safe, as are inland areas. However, unusual temperature and pressure conditions can cause a toxic fog to form in areas not normally prone to them. The small cities of Otomisi are located in such areas but precautions are still necessary. These settlements are more like workplaces than homes and most of the population are permanent residents, working in support industries or the chemical extraction, processing and research facilities. Without these facilities and their community of offworld workers, Otomisi’s economy would collapse.

There is a small amount of industry on-planet but it is insufficient to supply the population. Mutterings about self-sufficiency are common from time-to-time, but it is simply more economical to import what is needed than investing in facilities to make it.

The unusual conditions on Otomisi have attracted the interest of the Scout Service, which maintains a research and training facility on-planet. This not only studies the conditions required for the notorious fogs and their effects on the local ecosystem but also conducts hostile-environment training for scouts regularly rotated through the base.

PECENA Pecena is a habitable world, apart from the taint carried in its atmosphere, with a tiny population entirely restricted to a small town at what passes for a downport.
The reasons for this are shrouded in layer upon layer of bureaucratic obfuscation, with endless circular references to feasibility studies and pre-colonization investment forecasts. The reality is that the Imperial Army and Colonial Office have been fighting over Pecena for centuries.

Early in the expansion into Deneb, the Imperial Army sought a forward base at which to conduct large-scale training exercises. Pecena was at the time uninhabited and earmarked for development into a major base.
However, funds were diverted to other projects and work had not begun when the 20-year window for the project closed. The Colonial Office began to seek investors for a major settlement effort and made considerable progress when the Army derailed the project in the Imperial

courts. Successive Emperors have ruled on the Pecena Question but neither side has the resources to stand ready to act the moment a decision is handed down.
Plans must be made anew and each time a renewed objection is made further wrangling begins.

Thus, whilst Pecena has an extensive orbital port with naval and scout bases present, there is only a token presence groundside. The population are citizen-
employees of the Pecena Agricultural Corporation, which has license to operate robotic farms on the world regardless of what the Colonial Office or Imperial Army have to say about it. This license comes courtesy of the Imperial Navy, which wanted a reliable source of food for its orbital base and was not prepared to wait a thousand years for the Pecena Question to be settled.

In the meantime, the Imperial Army uses parts of Pecena for exercises. It wanted a major base through which personnel could be rotated but has to make do with a rather basic landing area surrounded by a permanently temporary camp. Live-fire exercises are common, with very powerful weapons deployed on the artillery ranges. The tough, thistle-like local vegetation has become a legendary nuisance among regiments using the training areas, with veterans having little good to say about Pecena’s ecosystem.

ZEEN Lying on the outer edge of the sector’s main cluster.
Zeen is not on the way to anywhere and sees little traffic through its low-quality starport. The world’s three million or so inhabitants are almost entirely Droyne, with a small community of Imperial Scout Service personnel who conduct observations but do not interact with the natives; not because the local population are unfriendly as such but beacuse they behave in ways that humans simply do not understand. The Droyne of Zeen may develop cordial relations with a merchant ship crew over many years, then completely ignore them on their next visit.

The Droyne of Zeen have a stable TL6 society, although some of their devices are sufficiently alien that their function cannot be guessed, let alone any level of sophistication. They do not seem particularly interested in progress, nor do they generally get involved in affairs of the outside universe. There have been exceptions, however.
Several Droyne vessels operate out of Zeen, although they cannot have been built there and can be encountered in ports across the sector. Droyne from Zeen have intervened on other worlds from time-to-time, notably coming to the assistance of the Krissukyoya on Giikusu.

## DUNMAG

### DENEB-SUBSECTOR G

The 28 star systems of the Dunmag subsector are, for the most part, arranged as variously sized clumps with jump-2 vessels required to transit between them. This creates a set of small local economies that have links to other, similar groupings. Whilst not as conducive to economic growth as a major main or cluster, these conditions did permit a modestly powerful economy to develop in the subsector before the Imperial Civil War.

During the ‘bad war’ phase of the war in Deneb, many worlds suffered major damage with population centres and industrial sites attacked from orbit. Some worlds –
notably Andalia, Twinian and Pagamin – were rendered all but uninhabitable. The consequences of this damage went beyond the boundaries of Dunmag; the destruction of economic assets created a hole in the middle of the sector, which later absorbed goods that could have been

DUNMAG SUBSECTOR

### Deneb

### G

sold elsewhere. While the damage was considerable elsewhere, the damage to Dunmag was bad enough that it affected the reconstruction of the whole sector.

Today, Dunmag is a market more than a producer of goods and its position between Inar and Atsah further contributes to this status. Trade ships from the larger economies of the sector compete for business in Dunmag, sometimes to the benefit of the locals, who can negotiate a good deal or benefit from one major player undercutting another to reduce market share. On the other hand, there is little money for investment in high-tech or high-value industry in a region with plenty just over the subsector borders.

Dunmag’s subsector fleet, the 125th, is concentrated largely in the coreward end of the subsector, with only minor patrol assets based elsewhere. This deployment strategy dates from a time – which some would say has not entirely passed – when corsair raids into Antra (to coreward) were such a problem that the 125th Fleet was routinely expected to provide ‘surge’ patrolling capability or cover routine deployments whilst the Antra subsector forces launched an attack on known corsair bases.
Proposals to move subsector fleet assets to the rimward end of the subsector have come to nothing, largely due to the expense of building new bases in an area not seriously threatened.

ANDALIA Andalia is a water world, with little in the way of useable land above sea level. Those areas that do exist were rendered unusable by nuclear bombardment in the 600s, when forces loyal to the Humbolt family made an example of Andalia’s small cities. The reasons for this action are complex and contentious, with few historians agreeing on whether the attack was properly sanctioned or the work of rogue elements with a score to settle. It was claimed that the Humbolts’ enemies were building a base on one of the larger islands but any evidence of this was eradicated along with all other major settlements.

Today, the land is safe to visit but the population has an aversion to doing so and will not even consider growing food there. The world’s atmospheric taint was made worse by radioactive fallout, though this has long since dispersed. All the same, Andalia has a reputation as a poisoned world which is at least partially deserved.

Andalia was repopulated in the years after the Civil War by people who were assigned there rather than by choice. This was one of several resettlement programmes that created resentful populations with little love for the Imperium and to this day, Andalia remains a backwater. It has been a haven for dissidents

and criminals, and is thought to have harboured corsairs based out of small, remote islands. No such bases have been found but the Imperial Navy monitors the world and conducts searches from time-to-time – which does nothing to improve relations with the locals.

GIIKUSU Giikusu is the homeworld of the Kirissukyoya, a minor race encountered across Deneb and sometimes beyond.
Around -2000 their TL7 society destroyed itself in a global conflict, setting the survivors on a path to extinction. The Kirissukyoya were saved by Droyne intervention beginning around -1500. This was on a fairly small scale but sufficient to preserve enough Kirissukyoya that they could establish production sites and eventually a little low-tech industry.

The Kirissukyoya recovery was greatly hampered by Vargr raids, to which at first the Kirissukyoya had no counter.
Eventually their communities were able to establish defences sufficient to make raiding them unprofitable and by the time Imperial scouts contacted them the Kirissukyoya were on the road to re-establishing a world state. The Imperium provided some protection from raids and low-key support for infrastructure and technology growth and by 180-200 the Kirissukyoya had begun building jump-capable vessels.

Some of these ships took part in the Vargr Campaigns.
Although they were small and crude compared to Imperial vessels, the Kirissukyoya ships had crews with scores to settle and willing to take reckless risks to ensure raids on their homeworld were stopped for good. By the time the Vargr Campaigns were over, the Kirissukyoya were firmly established as a spacefaring race and had created communities on other worlds where they mingled freely with other Imperial citizens.

IMLAAR Imlaar is an agricultural world notable as a stopover for jump-2 ships crossing the central region of Dunmag.
Its day-cycle is unusual due to interactions with the system’s type K (orange dwarf) companion star. The amount of additional light and energy from this star varies over time, whilst the central G type (yellow dwarf)
provides more constant light.

This results in complex seasonal changes, making farming a difficult prospect for those without the requisite knowledge. The agriculturalists of Imlaar have been working their land for many generations and have an almost instinctive understanding of it, switching from fast-growing high-yield crops to hardy staples across seasons. Imlaar’s agricultural output is thus greater than its population would normally be expected to achieve.

Imlaar’s central port is one of many export stations for its produce and occasionally overrun by livestock when one of the industrial-sized holding areas is left unattended. Huge warehouses full of grain make good money for the world’s people but hardly inspire excitement in visitors. Most ships refuel and move on, perhaps picking up some quality steak for the next leg of the journey but rarely stopping for longer than necessary.

PAGAMIN Pagamin is a small, dry world located close to Dunmag, and at one time prospective capital of the subsector.
Never heavily populated, Pagamin was a base during the bad war of the 600s and extensively bombarded from orbit using deadfall ordnance. The degree of overkill was enormous, suggesting that Pagamin was a broad hint to other worlds of the consequences of continued opposition.

As usual, the Humbolts are blamed for the atrocity but it is unclear which faction delivered the fatal blows. It is known that Pagamin did not fall easily. The Battle of Pagamin claimed several major warships from both sides before the Humbolts’ fleet broke through to the planet. Some accounts claim they landed troops and captured the world, although its significance is unclear.
These accounts have it that the Humbolts were then defeated in a second space battle and their groundside forces obliterated from orbit along with whatever was so important on the surface.

Close orbit around Pagamin is a graveyard of decaying wrecks. Some have been salvaged by specially licensed vessels operating out of the world’s very basic starport, but most were simply towed to a safer orbit and left there. The whole orbital sector is a designated war grave, and since the only reason Pagamin has a port is to salvage these ships, those without a pressing need do not go there. It is a utilitarian and rather grim place, surrounded by military cemeteries where the vacuum-preserved bodies of crews are laid to rest with perfunctory but solemn services.

SHINORASUS Shinorasus falls into the category of a ‘handy gravity well’ rather than inhabited world. A small community on the surface works mainly in ice-mining plants, harvesting ice from the world’s poles and deep craters for cracking liquid hydrogen. Some of these plants are permanent; others are crawlers or large grav vehicles that proceed from one ice field to another when the extracted hydrogen has run dry. There is a landing field at each of the larger installations but Shinorasus could not be said to have a starport as such.

The orbital port is another matter. It is arguably the best starport in the subsector, with extensive trade and freight-handling facilities. Unfortunately, these stand largely idle. Shinorasus starport was constructed by a consortium of shipping companies and business factors to take advantage of the very large investment expected in the area. This never materialised and the smart money got out after a few years. What is left is a grand shell gradually being cannibalised to keep up appearances.

Most ships that use the port are small traders rather than the high-volume freightliners it was intended to service.
These bring in revenue but nowhere near enough. Likewise the shipyards, intended to construct large vessels for corporate clients, take what work they can get. The port’s lifeline in recent years has been a contract to build low-
cost patrol vessels for various world governments. Even this has been threatened at times, as similar ships are available elsewhere at more attractive prices

There are segments of the port still supplied with power and air but which are largely abandoned other than by technical crews looking for components to salvage.
These segments are occupied by an unknown number of transients, living ‘off the grid’ yet still having access to the port’s datanet and facilities.

TWINIAN Twinian was never an important world, due to its very thin atmosphere of unbreathable gas. This was lost when the surface was bombarded with nuclear weapons and deadfall ordnance during the bad war of the 600s.
Some of the smaller sealed communities survived the initial attack but this just meant a slow death as life support equipment ran down. The world was abandoned for many decades before being repopulated to support a small starport.

Unlike Andalia, there was little difficulty in finding people willing to move to Twinian – with no atmosphere remaining there was little danger of contamination away from the craters – but a lack of investment created a dead-end community dependent on imports coming through the starport. Other towns were eventually built, largely as mining concerns, and are essentially self-
governing. In addition, scavengers moved into the ruins of some settlements spared in the original attacks and corsairs have possibly used these areas as bases.

Twinian has a small scout base at the starport, which supports jump-2 communications across the middle of the subsector. A detachment of scientists works out of the base, studying the gradual outgassing from Twinian’s rocky surface that will someday give it an atmosphere of sorts.

## ATSAH

### DENEB-SUBSECTOR H

The 24 star systems of Atsah are all within the Imperium, although the region has a distinct cultural identity as a result of its history. Atsah is astrographically important as a link to Corridor and thus to the Imperial heartland beyond and, as such, it is of strategic interest in regions as far away as the Spinward Marches. A more stable subsector might not draw such great attention but Atsah is prone to rather vigorous internal politics.

This situation has its origins in the pre-Imperial era.
Atsah was the centre of a loose federation of Vargr worlds when the Imperium began pushing through the sector and co-opted into Imperial membership by demonstrations of strength and incentives for local leaders. On one hand this allowed a large region to be

incorporated relatively easily; on the other it meant that the Duchy of Atsah continued in the previous tradition of turbulent politics based on personalities rather than policies.

At any given time, some worlds in Atsah are likely to be in rebellion, or in dispute with the Imperium, and some will have client state status rather than full membership.
This is a polite way of saying that the world government is making noise about secession from the Imperium, or even declared it, but Imperial authorities have not recognized the move as this would require a full intervention. This polite fiction allows other, subtler, measures to be taken – which can often be nothing more than waiting until the local political wind changes.

ATSAH SUBSECTOR

### Deneb

ATSAH (1).AI

The world has strong ties with Tukera Lines, which maintains a recruitment centre and training academy at the starport. Naturally, it is a matter of pride to produce the best graduates and highest proportion of successful applicants, and thus the ‘Tukera mindset’ is prevalent throughout Atadl society. Education and art reflects spacer culture, with a strong corporate bias.

This attitude is not without its opponents. There is a growing movement resisting the corporate-service lifestyle, with bohemian communities of artists, free thinkers and dropouts surrounding influential figures or frequenting certain social establishments. These
‘reactionary bars’ have become chic places for daring young Vargr to be seen flouting their society’s norms –
just a little – but are not seen as subversive or a threat to the stability of Atadl’s well entrenched social order.

ATSAH Atsah is the seat of the Duke of Atsah and the subsector capital. It is a garden world, very suitable for habitation, but has a relatively low population considering its importance, the result of a deliberate policy restricting immigration and encouraging citizens to move offworld by keeping the cost of living high. A guaranteed-income system ensures that those who choose to emigrate are paid at levels appropriate to Atsah’s expensive society, even if they are living somewhere much cheaper.

The money for this comes from the subsector budget’s social development funds and is extremely contentious.
However, the policy is kept in place by regular bargaining sessions, in which one hoped-for reward is permission to move to Atsah with its very high standard of living – with an expenses subsidy from the subsector budget of course.

The population includes around 55 million Vargr and 15 million members of other species, most notably humans. The majority of the population is concentrated in large, high-tech cities but there are extensive country estates and small towns scattered all over the planet.
The former typically belong to those who have served the duke or subsector administration well and may be held in perpetuity or only as long as the duke’s favour is retained. The towns are mostly agricultural centres providing a modest income from exports.

The subsector administrative centre is a small city in its own right, located in beautiful countryside with recreation areas nearby. Some of these are restricted by rank or special privilege; others are open to anyone. The duke lives at the heart of this administrative complex, which has its own spaceport manned by the duke’s

Jump Bridge Atsah maintains a bridge on a single, very large ice asteroid (map hex 2814). This links 10 worlds in the Dunmag and Atsah subsectors with a jump-
1 main, which begins in trailing Atsah and runs throughout the Ian and Khouth subsectors in Corridor. In total, this main contains 21 systems in Deneb and another 20 worlds in Corridor.

The public reason for this bridge is to promote jump-1 merchant traffic in the subsector. An unstated, but generally understood, reason is to permit jump-1 access to Dunmag, the ostensible capital world of the subsector. This allows Atsah to exert influence on Dunmag with relatively cheap ships. In contrast, Inar not only needs a minimum of jump-2, but it also has a greater distance to cover: 14 parsecs instead of Atsah’s seven.

The Dukes of Atsah have always put their disputes with Vincennes and Inar, and their own interests, ahead of those of the Imperium. The dukes have a history of permitting favoured factions to get away with extreme bending of rules and only intervening to stop conflicts when external pressure becomes too much or their favourites start losing. The region has become a constant low-level nuisance, with the occasional major crisis and given its strategic importance this is of grave concern to the Imperial authorities.

The subsector fleet – the 88th – is heavily politicised and whilst it does the job of suppressing independent pirates, it tends to become embroiled in local disputes and turn a blind eye to ‘internal’ transgressions. Sector fleet assets are routinely assigned to conduct gunboat diplomacy in the region and remind all local factions that there are limits to wayward behaviour, even if the subsector duke is willing to tolerate their actions.

ATADL Located close to the main trade lanes, Atadl is a high-population, high-tech world that exports goods across the sector and far beyond. Its two billion or so inhabitants are mostly Vargr, with a few humans and other species. Society is very much outward-looking; Atadl considers itself a part of the wider universe and attempts to exert influence wherever possible.

own household forces. Everything about the city – and the orbital starport – is designed to impress and subtly
(but not too subtly) remind visitors just how powerful Atsah is. From neat rows of smartly uniformed guards on parade during the duchy’s many ceremonial occasions, to ducal frigates passing overhead as they proceed towards their landing at the spaceport, Atsah’s capital is a showcase of power and splendour.

KIIRINDOR Kiirindor is notable primarily as an x-boat station and naval base and provides an essential link for jump-4 traffic headed for Usani. Less capable ships have to make a long transit through Dunmag, adding weeks or even months to the trip. The world itself is unremarkable except for its unusual government.

Kiirindor is governed from Maelstrom, site of Imperial Research Station Gamma. This was originally an emergency measure imposed when local governance collapsed several decades ago but has since become the norm. Delegations of administrators and directors are sent to Kiirindor to provide leadership to a populace who have become so used to the arrangement that a proposal to return to self-governance was rejected by the vast majority of citizens.

It has been claimed that the administration of Kiirindor is overseen by the research station on Maelstrom but

this is simply not true. The story has its origin in a vid drama of a few years back and has no basis in reality.
Kiirindor is governed by feudal technocrats from Maelstrom, not mad scientists from Research Station Gamma.

SEGAN Segan is known to have been terraformed at some point in the distant past, by unknown entities. The result was an extremely arid but borderline habitable planet with no life of its own. All species currently present were transplanted by the terraformers or later arrivals including humans and Vargr. These species included the Segani, a minor race who are intolerant of jump travel.
Their original place of origin has never been determined and probably lies outside of Charted Space.

Segan’s location on the x-boat route ensures its port sees large volumes of through-trade and it is a major hub for commercial traffic in the local cluster. A jump-
4 service is maintained to Kiirindor, with a few jump-3 vessels proceeding to Torm and the surrounding worlds in Dunmag by way of gas giant refuelling at Erita. This is considered something of an adventure by first-time space travellers. Despite skimming operations being quite routine, there is a small element of danger, and thus excitement, which is not to be had during the usual port-to-port transits made by commercial starships.

Star Lane contains 30 star systems, all of which are Imperial territory. Ten of these systems form part of a cluster extending into Vincennes and Gulf. This region is heavily influenced by the duchy of Vincennes whether the local nobility like it or not, leading to endless political machinations.

The Duke of Vincennes cannot directly command the votes of the Star Lane nobility when an issue is debated in the Imperial Moot but tries to control their voting

by making life difficult until he wants something, then offering incentives – which sometimes amount to little more than a cessation of harassment – to align their votes with those of his supporters.

The counts of Askigaak, as senior Imperial nobles in the region, have long expected to be elevated to subsector dukes. Opposition to Vincennes’ influence stems in part from a desire to be seen to be powerful, capable and independent and at times this is more important to the

counts than local stability. Askigaak and Vincennes have been known to throw obstacles in one another’s way for purely political reasons, often hamstringing worthy projects.

With no subsector duke in place, the spinward-coreward cluster around Daumier tends to look to Mora in the Spinward Marches for leadership and support. Most worlds in this area are undeveloped but Mater Nova has a sufficiently large economy to benefit from its position at the extreme end of the Spinward Main.

The remainder of the subsector’s worlds are mostly concentrated in two small clusters of no great importance. These areas are markets for the huge economies of Mora and Vincennes, with large jump-
2 freighters making the rounds on a frequent – if not always regular – basis.

The 196th Fleet, charged with maintaining security and stability in the subsector, both suffers and benefits from a lack of political direction. Its bases all lie in the primary cluster, requiring long transits to reach distant patrol stations. Under normal circumstances, Imperial fleets are advised by the local high nobility – although they are not commanded directly by those nobles – but without a subsector duke in place the 196th Fleet lacks a clear political strategy of its own and is subject to the influences of the Dukes of Vincennes and Mora. Whilst its senior officers have more autonomy than is the case

in many subsector fleets, it is impossible to please both dukes as well as the local less senior nobility and the fleet finds itself enmeshed in endless political wrangling.

ASKIGAAK Askigaak is the seat of the Count of Askigaak, who has ambitions to one day be Duke of Star Lane. The world’s population numbers around 90 billion, most of whom are from the native sentient species, the Sigka.
A few million humans and other offworlders dwell on Askigaak’s few useable land masses.

The human population is ruled directly by the Count of Askigaak, an unusual situation but not entirely unknown.
An efficient bureaucratic apparatus implements the count’s edicts and in general the world is smoothly governed. The starport code refers to the generally-
available landing sites – all traffic through the small but efficient highport requires a license from the Office of Interstellar Affairs, one of many specialized departments set up by the government.

Licences are not cheap but easy enough to obtain since they exist primarily to make money for the count. This is technically a restriction of interstellar trade and thus a violation of Imperial High Law but the count gets away with it partly by way of legal obfuscation – presenting the licensing arrangement as a means of paying for the

The Sachupe have been described as ‘horrific tentacled whales... only worse’. They are large deep-water predators capable of a surprising turn of speed, although they cannot turn quickly. Sachupe generally do not need to; their favoured attack is a rapid dash at the target with grabbing tentacles or an ambush from behind seabed cover. Smaller prey are grabbed and stuffed into the creature’s maw, whilst larger creatures may be rammed before being dragged to the mouth. Sachupe are adept at manoeuvring their prey so the first bite cripples the tail of a swimming creature.

Sachupe are not a threat to an underwater colony’s structures but frequently mistake seabed farming or maintenance craft for rivals, prey or potential mates.
They are intelligent enough to know that submarines contain edible creatures and have been known to drag one down below its crush depth or ram a vessel against rocks to crack its hull. Groups will sometimes gather close to an underwater settlement and drift outside, coming right up to viewing ports to peer in and testing the surface with their tentacles.

orbital port he built with his own funds – and partly through complex political wrangling that allows the count to derail any investigation into his business practices.

The Sigka are self-governing within their own underwater communities and in constant conflict with ocean-
going predators such as the Sachupe. Some leave their homeworld and journey around the subsector but for the most part they are content to remain in their ocean homes.

CHAOSHEO Chaosheo is neither somewhere nor nowhere. Lying on the fringe of Deneb, it is more or less a forgotten backwater that occasionally becomes entangled in the cross-border politics of Vincennes and Mora. For many years, Chaosheo was Red Zoned as it is the homeworld of an aquatic sentient species called the Shi’awei. In recent years, the interdiction has been lifted and some settlement has taken place.

The world’s population figure of 60 million or so is an estimate and a vague one at that. Researchers do not really know how many Shi’awei there are since their society is complex and fragmented. Carrying out a population census of an uncooperative species that lives in deep water is a challenging task even for the Scout Service.

The human population numbers only a few hundred, all of whom dwell in a single settlement originally built as a research base to study the native people. As always, supporting industries grew up around the rudimentary port and the world gradually acquired a ‘native’ human

population. Interactions between these people and the true indigenous inhabitants are uncommon except for underwater exploration and research missions by Scout Service personnel. However, humans are beginning to establish a fishing industry that might cause friction in the near future.

KERNAL Kernal is a warm and fertile world, with large agricultural surpluses sold across the subsector. Its starport almost always has at least one ‘grain ship’ (a general term for a bulk agricultural transport) in dock and smaller vessels can usually find cargoes of high-value luxury foodstuffs on offer.

Kernal has a population of around three million humans in addition to around 27 million members of the indigenous sentient species, the Yafizethe. The horrifically complex politics of the Yafizethe have led to them becoming extremely skilled diplomats sought out by clients in distant reaches of space.

The world was only united under a single government in the last century. Before this it was subdivided into small nations and city-states, which were often in conflict with one another. Coming to an agreement over central governance was a herculean task made more impressive by the fact that there was no overwhelming external threat to motivate a move towards unity. The Yafizethe simply decided amongst themselves that their interests were best served by becoming a world state. Opponents were talked around over the decades, although there has been some conflict and the occasional insurgency flares up.

## VINCENNES

### DENEB- SUBSECOR J

Astrographically, Vincennes is a typical subsector with 32 star systems grouped into clusters of varying sizes, all accessible by a jump-2 ship. The subsector is named for the world of Vincennes, which has been its capital since incorporation into the Imperium in 243.

equipment in addition to larger amounts of TL15 goods.
Not surprisingly, it dominates local markets for high-end goods. However, not every world can make use of such items – mid-tech equipment is a better investment on backwater worlds without the infrastructure to support advanced technology.

The early development of Vincennes was driven by the Humbolt family until their exile beyond the Imperium in 628. Progress continued afterward, albeit at a slower pace, and new dukes followed the existing practice of concentrating economic and technological progress on Vincennes rather than uplifting nearby worlds.
This ensured that Vincennes attained an unassailable position as the most advanced and productive world in the sector.

The Dukes of Vincennes see themselves as the foremost nobles of Deneb and have often acted as if they were sector dukes appointed over other subsector dukes, rather than equals. Vincennes expends a lot of effort in attempting to gain control over the systems of Star Lane and has been known to go to great expense just to win over a world government or mid-level noble for a time if it thwarts the plans of others.

The 258th Fleet has always had a difficult relationship with the subsector dukes. Whilst other great nobles in the sector seem to think they own the Imperial forces assigned to their region, Vincennes is the most blatant.
Other dukes apply pressure upon their subsector fleet; Vincennes issues direct orders, even though this is not

permitted, and routinely refers to the 258th as the Fleet of the Duchy of Vincennes.

In recent years, the duke has backed off a little on this approach, after a near-mutiny when the 258th Fleet was ordered to enter Sabine and carry out actions that would inevitably lead to a confrontation with the 195th Fleet based there. However, it is only a matter of time before the Duke of Vincennes tries once more to use the Imperial Navy as his personal force and another admiral is put in the position of having to flatly refuse to obey an illegal order.

HRD HRD (Humbolt Research Directorate) was settled and developed to be a scientific community, although supporting industry was necessary. Association with the disgraced Humbolt family is unwelcome these days, so the world goes by its initials but remains a major centre for scientific progress.

HRD does not have a single remit or unified research facility. Instead, it is home to a large number of independent research corporations active in areas ranging from jump technology to archaeology of stone-
age native sophonts on other worlds. Although HRD is within the Duchy of Vincennes and heavily associated with it, its research installations will take contracts from any bidder providing the combination of money and political expediency is right. Some jobs are simply too much trouble as they cause friction with Vincennes

but, for the most part, top-end research is available to anyone with a large enough stack of Credits.

HRD also hosts academies for the Imperial armed forces. These mostly handle specialist training for non-commissioned personnel and command or staff courses for officers but there are also contingency planning groups and forward-projection boards who seek to identify the future needs of the navy and marines in terms of technology, equipment and doctrine.

Much of the work that goes on at HRD is classified or confidential, as might be expected of top-end research. A few installations are so secretive that nobody even knows what general field they work in – it might be antimatter power generation or identification of fakes among fine art pieces. Rumors abound, especially of facilities working with the navy or scouts.
Superweapons, enhanced-jump ships and psionic teleportation are all thought to be under development on HRD but those employed to do the work or support it have nothing to say on the subject.

NORTHAMMON Northammon is a beautiful but forbidding world, with extensive mountain ranges and a low average temperature that results in extensive glaciation. The atmosphere is prone to violent weather patterns and intense electrical storms, which are exciting to watch but dangerous to be out in.

The majority of the six million or so inhabitants dwell in the equatorial regions, mostly in areas sheltered from prevailing winds by mountain ranges. These regions produce considerable amounts of agricultural goods, which for many years provided Northammon’s main source of income. Disputes between local agricultural corporations and megacorporate interests, which were trying to gain a foothold in Northammon, eventually flared up into open conflict.

Years of conflict between corporate security elements, mercenary units and local militia were eventually brought to a halt by Imperial intervention. The world is currently under military rule as a result, with the occasional skirmish still occurring in remote areas. The cities are garrisoned by specialist security battalions of the Imperial Army, who are skilled in urban combat as well as paramilitary policing and mediation. Forces

intended for use in the outback are more combat-
oriented, including a light grav cavalry detachment.

Administration of the world is handled by the Imperial Bureaucracy, which is gradually attempting to transfer control back to local governance. The process is slow and painful however, as many of the local leaders harbour resentment towards the Imperium and its megacorporations. To the people of Northammon, it is hard to tell the difference between the two and a significant proportion of the population worries that the Imperial occupation is going to simply hand control of the world over to the megacorporations when the troops pull out.

VINCENNES Vincennes is the most famous world in the sector and one of the few whose name is known across the Imperium. This is in part due to its possession of extremely high technology and partly due to its connection with the infamous Humbolt family.

Vincennes has a modest amount of useable land above sea level but its atmospheric taint and turbulence of the dense atmosphere ensure that only a small proportion of the population live on land. The vast majority dwell in undersea cities, most located on what is sometimes called an undersea continent; a vast area of shallow water with the occasional mountaintop peeking above the surface. This region is normally called the Great Shoal, or just the Shoal.

Settlements located elsewhere on the planet are for the most part of minor importance, with the exception of a handful of gravitic cities. These remain high in the atmosphere, where the pressure is less and effects of weather milder. Although they can go where they please, the cities each tend to remain over a specific region of the planetary surface.

As might be expected, Vincennes is a major exporter of high-technology goods. Only a small amount of TL16 equipment is available and it is very expensive even here at its source. TL15 goods are the staple export of Vincennes and are shipped out in large quantities.
Much of the production process is robotic, from the seabed mines to packing and shipment centres. Almost anything can be done remotely, enabling many Vincenzi to enjoy a lazy lifestyle.

HIGH-PERFORMANCE GRAV HARNESS A significant advance on early grav belts, the HPGH or ‘hug-pug’ consists of a belt and shoulder straps that can be adjusted to fit over bulky clothing such as a vacc suit or be worn under a normal jacket. Bulk and weight are only slightly less than a standard grav belt, but a hug-pug offers the user significant advantages over earlier models. Among them is gravitic support for the user; early grav belts work well enough but the wearer tends to suffer a sensation of dangling uncomfortably in the belt with the load concentrated around the waist. This has been compared to the opposite of wearing an extremely heavy tool belt and quickly leads to discomfort. The HPGH version greatly reduces this sensation, reducing operator fatigue.

In addition, an HPGH projects a low-powered field around the user, deflecting rain and small objects as well as reducing wind resistance. The unit cannot fly any faster than a standard grav belt – it is still limited to Medium speed – but flight is much more comfortable and can be sustained for longer. An HPGH can operate for 24 hours before requiring recharging, and has an emergency system built in. This will automatically slow a fall and correct a tumble, unless countermanded by the operator, and will return an unconscious or incapacitated wearer to a prearranged safe location.

SENSOR SPIKES Sensor spikes are thin, 6cm long spikes designed to be pushed into any surface. A one-use battery generates a cutting field at the sharp end, enabling the spike to be pushed into a rock face or wall without difficulty and a spike can be thrown into a softer surface. Once emplaced, a set of ultra-
thin fibre antennae are deployed, gathering a range of data and transmitting it in bursts or in real-time transmissions to any designated computer. Their internal power lasts for 48 hours.

Spikes gather optical and thermal data with a tiny camera in the head and monitor the temperature of the surface the spike is embedded in and surrounding air, along with chemical composition, radiation levels and vibrations. A network of spikes can be used to create a perimeter alarm system or gather data for scientific purposes. Most sensors only gather data from within 5m of the spike, although vibrations can be sensed at greater distances depending on intensity. Transmission range is 25m, but a chain of spikes can relay information over almost any distance.

### A03/79056 SMART UTILITY

### CLOTHING

All manner of enhanced clothing is available on Vincennes but Travellers are likely to be most interested in the utility ranges. ‘Smart’ clothing is designed to protect the user from work-related hazards. It is little use against hard vacuum but can deal with a range of other hazards. The typical outfit consists of either trousers and a tunic or a coverall-like garment, well tailored to the user and very lightweight. An additional over-jacket and boots can be bought, doubling the cost of the outfit.

Smart utility clothing stores energy generated by the user’s body heat and can use it for a variety of purposes.
Most commonly, the outfit will warm or cool the user, allowing work in environments without the encumbrance of a heavy coat. Temperatures up to 50 Celsius and down to -10 can be tolerated for as long as the suit’s energy store holds out. This is usually around 6-8 hours, after which a return to more normal temperatures is required to dump excess heat or store more energy.

In a more hazardous situation, a smart utility garment negates one dice of damage received from high or low temperatures but not concentrated energy sources such as lasers. In addition, smart utility clothing is tough, giving the wearer Protection +1 if no armor is worn, and can be set to generate a low-powered electrical field or ultrasonic vibration that will cause small creatures such as snakes to leave the user alone. The field may interfere with delicate machinery and should not be used in proximity.

Usani borders the Great Rift, although most of its 30 worlds are concentrated in a single large cluster, with no outliers in the rift itself. The proximity of the rift gives the subsector what is often termed a ‘hard border’, a natural frontier that has influenced the development of the rest of the subsector.

Usani contains Deneb, nominal capital of the sector.
This honor is largely ceremonial as there is no sector duke and the Duchy of Usani is weak compared to its rivals. There are some advantages to be had from being the sector capital however; many businesses feel there is kudos to be had from operating out of Deneb and state visits by the Imperial family have to include the sector capital. As host, the Duke of Usani has the ear of a visitor – although these occasions are rare enough that the advantage is offset by the expense of maintaining a suitable set of accommodations.

The Duchy of Usani also administers Geniishir and Vast Heavens. Geniishir contains just four star systems, all easily reached by a jump-2 ship from Deneb. Other worlds close to these in Atsah are administered by the Duchy of Atsah but are astrographically remote from it due to the minor rift lying to coreward-trailing. The Duchy of Usani exerts some influence over these worlds, which are part of the local economy to a greater degree than that of Atsah.

The 154th Fleet, assigned to protect the subsector, has its bases towards the rimward end. It is primarily active in the central cluster, with outlying worlds receiving few patrols. Elements of the fleet are routinely sent into

Geniishir to conduct the usual commerce-protection and flag-showing duties and occasionally make a foray into nearby worlds at the rimward end of Atsah. This does not cause friction with the Duke of Atsah or the Imperial Navy forces assigned to the subsector; it is a logical piece of cooperation that relieves the 88th Fleet of this responsibility. However, the arrangement has at times become the victim of local politics, to the detriment of populations and Imperial fleet personnel alike.

DENEB The Deneb system was named for its blue-white giant primary rather than its mainworld, although eventually the name of the mainworld was changed. Deneb is the homeworld of the Nenlat, an amphibious minor race who had achieved only the most basic technology when humans arrived.

The Nenlat evolved in low-lying wetlands and most still occupy these areas. Their traditional villages are capable of maintaining a TL4 society, with some imported high-
technology items here and there. ‘High technology’ in the case of the Nenlat means around TL6-8 for the most part. Higher-tech items require too much support and do not remain functional for long in the damp conditions favoured by traditional Nenlat.

Some Nenlat live among the ‘interstellar’ society of Deneb, which is made up mostly of humans with some Vargr and other species scattered among them. These Nenlat are thoroughly Imperial in outlook and consider

NENLAT

ANIMAL HITS SPEED Nenlat 21 6 m SKILLS Melee (natural) 1, Survival 1 ATTACKS Stinger (1D)
TRAITS Amphibious BEHAVIOUR Omnivore, Sophont

The Nenlat are semi-aquatic sophonts native to Deneb’s wetlands and equally at home walking on land or swimming in shallow water. Their barrel-shaped bodies are trilaterally near-symmetrical, with three legs, three arms and three flippers. A head containing the brain and most sensory organs faces the ‘central’ arm and leg, with the shorter central arm used for most fine manipulation tasks and the longer ‘side-rear’ arms better suited to manoeuvring through weed-cluttered waters.

Nenlat have a stinger at the back of the neck, which can curve up over the head to strike a target gripped by the Nenlat. Normally, the stinger lies along the back, although it may twitch about when the Nenlat is agitated.
The stinger’s venom is capable of killing smaller creatures but is painful rather than life-threatening to humans.

Church of Stellar Divinity

themselves superior to ‘traditional’ wetlands Nenlat.
This manifests itself as contempt and a tendency towards patronising protectiveness. There is no real animosity, just a lack of understanding between the two cultures.

Deneb is a major centre for the Church of Stellar Divinity, which is hardly surprising since the system’s primary is one of the most impressive stars in Charted Space. The local variant of the Church considers that
‘their’ star-god is bigger and better than the others and that, therefore, they are the chosen people. This does not go over well with other worshippers, who consider the Denebian branch of the faith to be a bit too holier-than-thou.

Religious law is very strict in the cities of Deneb and enforced with vigour. There is no secular law, other than regulations for interstellar trade and commerce.
Everything else is governed by religious law, although most of it is broadly similar to the codes used by other civilised societies. Visitors can fall foul of the many peculiar technicalities of Denebian law but most infractions are dealt with by a token fine (described as a donation towards good works and actually used for that purpose in almost all cases) and a requirement to perform a minor penance. This is almost always a trivial task accompanied by a sermon on how it relates to the key elements of Denebian faith. The system is intended to teach visitors about the world’s religion and perhaps win converts, although most offworlders find it tiresome.

Deneb has what is thought to be an Ancients site. It is quite extensive but almost completely ruined and appears to have been a major city at one time. Most of the ruin is semi-submerged in the wetlands, although the land was probably well drained when it was built.
Nenlat children play among the tumbled spires and

broken walls, gaining access despite the best efforts of a private security firm to let only properly authorized scientists study the remains.

EXILE Exile is, as the name suggests, a prison world. It is infamous as ‘the prison planet that could not hold Zid Rachele’, although there are claims that Rachele actually died on Exile and the tale of his escape was fabricated by his followers.

Being landed on Exile is a life sentence – contrary to certain vid shows, the Imperium does not send agents to prison planets looking for criminals whose skills it needs. For many, the term of incarceration is short. Most new inmates are given no equipment or outdoor clothing and are murdered for their shoes before they get their bearings. Those who survive normally do so by joining one of the communities of Exile.

Society is rough and harsh but some prisoners have banded together to create a civilization of sorts. This has been a form of rehabilitation for some and since some sort of law is necessary for stability those who intend to live a long life have had to create a functioning society complete with its own justice system. The irony of this is not lost upon Imperial researchers who observe the goings-on of the penal colony with interest.

These researchers are safely aboard navy ships watching the world. The navy takes aggressive action against any unauthorized vessels that approach, although it is probable that the occasional smuggler gets through.
Prisoners have escaped from Exile but always with outside help.

There is a widely held belief that the first prisoners to be incarcerated on Exile were members of the Humbolt family and that they have a secret base there.
There is no substance to this; it is nothing more than a fanciful story that refuses to wither no matter how much evidence is thrown at it. The Humbolts were exiled beyond the Imperium, although it may be that the authorities regret this decision. If they were on Exile at some point, then perhaps the authorities might have some idea where they are now.

LIRAN Liran is a mining colony. The ‘mainworld’ is a dwarf planet correctly named Liran Central but usually just called Liran. It lies on the outer fringe of one of the system’s two planetoid belts; both are extensively mined, with semi-permanent facilities on some of the larger bodies and temporary camps or mining ships moving from one promising strike to another.

Liran has some industry of its own but most of the produce from its mining industry is shipped out aboard bulk freighters. These are well protected but corsairs have been known to prey upon smaller craft using the port or mining ships in the belts. Liran has another hazard as well; it is infested with Clambreys. These creatures are not native to Liran and cannot survive on its airless surface, although they can hibernate in vacuum for an extended period. It is likely that Clambreys got into Liran’s disused mine tunnels after hitching a ride aboard a starship from another infested world. Once established, they can be very hard to root out and Liran’s Clambrey problem is no exception.

The origin of this creature’s name is obscure but is probably the result of some spacer’s attempt at a play on words. Clambreys are crustacean-like creatures with an extremely hard outer skin. They are surprisingly agile and can clamber (hence the name, possibly) onto a spacecraft without difficulty, although also without much in the way of grace or elegance. The typical Clambrey is about the size of a large dog, with deep-set eyes and chitinous plates protecting most of its body rather than a true shell. They have six walking/climbing legs and two manipulator pincers.

TETZEL Tetzel is a dry world with a thin, tainted atmosphere and unattractive to settlers. Although a high-quality starport was built in orbit to facilitate local trade, Tetzel itself was never the subject of an organised colonization and development program. A handful of people moved in and set-up homesteads on the better land, and today these steaders receive a small subsidy from the duchy administration that allows them to import and maintain TL11 equipment. The subsidy is all that prevents the world from being abandoned, which the subsector duke does not consider desirable.

Tetzel’s atmospheric taint takes the form of mildly radioactive dust particles, posing a long-term health hazard to anyone breathing the world’s air unfiltered.
The origins of this taint are unclear but thought to be connected with the Ancients site discovered near the world’s north pole. Like much about Tetzel, this site is disappointing, consisting only of a few abandoned structures of great age. There appears to be a lower level beneath this but its tunnels and chambers have collapsed. It is conjectured that this was externally induced by some means other than the obvious bombardment but no clues to the technology used have emerged.

BEHAVIOUR Carnivore, Scavenger

Clambreys breathe oxygen but can function in very low pressure environments without undue difficulty. Low oxygen content is also not much of a problem for them; smoke or atmospheric taints do not seem to interfere with respiration. If there is no oxygen at all, such as a space vessel with a Clambrey attached to the hull, it will go into a coma-like state and hibernate for weeks or even months. Waking from this state takes time, during which the Clambrey remains still. Occasionally, a Clambrey wakes up on the hull of a starship in port at a new world, drops off and goes in search of something to eat. Since all Clambreys carry eggs, this can create a problem even if the creature is hunted down and killed.

Clambreys appear to be hermaphroditic and can carry fertilised eggs in a dormant state for months or years.
Eggs are deposited when sufficient food is available, and finding a suitable place to nurture the young is one of the Clambrey’s driving instincts. As a result, they tend to range widely and investigate whatever they find. This leads to an unfortunate tendency to wedge themselves into odd spaces on starship hulls or wander into unattended cargo bays. Clambreys are not territorial unless they have eggs laid in the vicinity and even then they are not hard to drive off. This makes it quite difficult to tell if a Clambrey has laid eggs; most Travellers will assume it has and go looking for them.

## GULF

### DENEB-SUBSECTOR M

The Gulf is characterised by small clusters of star systems with easy jump-2 navigation across the subsector. It has no subsector duke and is generally thought of as a protectorate of Trin in the Spinward Marches. Unfortunately, Trin’s interests extend only to the nearest worlds; the trailing parts of the subsector are largely ignored. Similarly, Vincennes exerts influence over the coreward-trailing worlds but gives little priority to the rest of the subsector.

This does not mean that Gulf is a dangerous frontier, of course. It is more accurate to describe it as an underdeveloped backwater where the influence of three duchies meet but none are particularly strong. This means that powerplays tend to be on a small scale and typically considered of low importance. Gulf is a place where other interests can come to the fore, at least locally, without being crushed by the subsector duke.

The Scout Service way station at Upuraku is something of an oddity. Way stations are intended to serve the x-boat network and Upuraku should have formed part of a link between Trin and Zeng. The route was never implemented however, leaving the Scout Service to find a use for an extremely expensive and well-equipped installation.

Way Station Upuraku supports the Trin end of the x-boat link, carrying out mid-life refits on x-boats and their tenders. These are rotated out of service for a more extensive overhaul than the routine maintenance conducted at other way stations. Similarly, an array of Scout Service craft are overhauled at Upuraku, including long-range exploration vessels and converted navy cruisers. Notable among these are Azhanti High Lightning-class cruisers transferred from the Imperial Navy for Scout Service use.

GULF SUBSECTOR

### Deneb

### M

The way station is also a major training centre, with Scout Service recruits receiving orientation and specialist training packages, and some personnel return later in their careers as instructors or to retrain for a new role. The installation’s information-collation facility is one of the main intelligence hubs in the region behind the claw, receiving a steady stream of couriers and processing their raw data. Once analysed, reports are disseminated wherever needed

- routine census and survey data goes into the public

datanet and spreads across the sector but more sensitive information is made available only to the upper echelons of the naval command structure and subsector dukes.

High-jump couriers routinely leave Way Station Upuraku headed trailingwards, ultimately bound for Capital. It is no secret what data is carried aboard them – everything known at Upuraku at that moment – but what is contained within these data packets is highly classified.
Most are routine but occasionally a courier leaves with word of a war, rebellion or act of treason on the part of a major noble. It will be many months before a response reaches Gulf but the courier network ensures that one will most certainly come.

QEVAR Qevar is classified as a charismatic dictatorship by the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service, which is one way of interpreting its society. Others use terms like ‘weird mystical police state’ or ‘cult headquarters’.

Some of this weirdness reaches the starport but is countered by a strong interstellar business community that will not tolerate interference with the operations of a major port, which could affect trade across the subsector and far beyond. The Imperial authorities do not, as a rule, interfere in the affairs of member worlds and are willing to let the Qevarians do as they please on-
planet so long as there is no interference with free trade.
A commission from the Imperial Ministry of Justice and the Bureaucracy is maintained at the port, observing the affairs of the planetary population in case Imperial High Laws are infringed, although local society seems to be strange but not illegal.

The government of Qevar comprises officials appointed by the leader of the world’s religious sect, which believes that every living thing is connected and enforces a strictly vegetarian diet for everyone on-planet – indigenous population and offworlders alike. Most of the world’s many laws are based around respect for others, free speech and protection of the environment. In principle, these are positive concepts, but taken to such extremes that society manages to be oppressively respectful, with free speech encouraged but many of the things someone might say punishable as offences against the arrangements, as the cult’s core beliefs are called.

The cult’s members are taught to eschew material possessions and contribute wholeheartedly to whatever group they are part of. Group marriages are not uncommon, although there is no official policy on the subject. Other groupings are social, economic or artistic in nature. Qevarian society is highly complex as a result, with a shifting pattern of subgroupings as people move from one group to another – apparently freely.

Similarly, members are free to leave the cult, although membership is mandatory for citizenship of Qevar. A small community of ex-members live at the highport but most drift across the sector. Few have much that is bad to say about their time on Qevar; although oppressive to the outside eye, the cult’s way of life makes sense to its members and most feel more sadness than resentment after they leave. However, there are always suspicions that the inner leadership may be less wholesome than their beneficent public image indicates.

TUWAYK Lying just within the area of interest of Trin, Tuwayk is a backwater world of importance mainly for its starport.
One of the standard jump-2 routes into Trin and thereby the Spinward Marches, runs through the port, although it could not really be said to pass through the world itself. The port acts as a local trade hub but Tuwayk does not export much and thus benefits little.

The world itself is very dry and extremely hot, with an indigenous ecosystem hostile to humans and most imported species. Attempts at ‘soft terraforming’ by way of introducing algae and similar primitive life that –
hopefully – would eventually supplant the local species have been decisively defeated by the resilient and aggressive ecosystem of Tuwayk.

Tuwayk is very much a backwater but within its cities it is a comfortable one. Harsh conditions outside are counterpointed by luxurious, if bland, climate-controlled living areas. There really is no local culture as such; society is very much Imperial-standard and influenced mainly by what is fashionable at Trin.

Trin also exerts considerable political and economic influence over Tuwayk, offering subsidies or reduced prices on necessary goods in return for continued loyalty. Normally few strings are attached but the world government controls the starport and occasionally it is useful to throw a few obstacles in the way of a rival. At these times, quietly having control over port operators can be a useful tool in making a shipping operator or business group’s activities in the region a little more costly and frustrating.

## ZENG

### DENEB-SUBSECTOR N

The Zeng subsector lies close to the fringe of the Great Rift, giving it a hard border similar to that of Deneb. To rimward are a few worlds in Macon; a handful in Kamlar

lie to trailing. As a result of its positioning, Zeng did not receive an equal share of early investment and has lagged behind the development of other subsectors since.

USANI SUBSECTOR

### Deneb

### N

The Duchy of Zeng administers the worlds of Macon
(to rimward, in Reft) and Kamlar. It is perhaps the weakest of the Denebian duchies but in many ways the most stable. It is not threatened by raids from across the coreward border and on the fringes of the internal powerplays of Deneb. Relations with the Duchy of Trin, on the far side of Gulf, are consistently good. Zeng has strong trade links running through Gulf and does all it can to protect them, which sometimes draws resources the duchy cannot really afford.

Zeng is protected by the 260th Fleet, one of two bearing that number. The ‘Zeng 260th’ is resentful of the way the other fleet of that number – stationed in the Antares sector – calls itself ‘the first 260th’, a claim based upon the difference in commissioning dates. The first 260th was to be redesignated and the name assigned to a new subsector fleet in Deneb but last-minute lobbying reversed the decision to rename the Antares-based force, although not before orders were sent to commission a new 260th in Zeng. The Zeng 260th sometimes refers to itself as ‘the Only’, in contrast to the Antares force claim to be the first, as at the time of its creation it was indeed the only fleet bearing that name. Whilst rather silly, this dispute is acrimonious and has been the cause of many a bar fight.

The 260th Fleet is overstrength compared to many other subsector fleets, with an unusually high proportion of destroyers. This is partly to allow coverage into nearby subsectors that have no fleet of their own but there may be other reasons. The presence of bases along the Great Rift fringe – and few towards the coreward end of the subsector – suggests an interest in the rift. The 260 th Fleet sometimes receives command of one or more high-jump rift cruisers designed for deep-space operations, although these are always handed back after a few months. It is not clear what these ships are doing but it may be that the 260th Fleet has responsibility for deep-space fuel caches. Other, wilder, theories claim it is charged with monitoring a deep-space installation or watching for some threat from within the Great Rift.

BALZAC Balzac is notable mainly as the site of the Battle of Balzac, where the last of the Humbolts’ capital ships were brought to action and destroyed. Losses were heavy on both sides and although some minor forces did survive, the Humbolts’ power was broken.
The wrecks of several cruisers and destroyers, and even a dreadnought, can be found on the planetary surface. Critical systems were removed, along with all the bodies that could be recovered, but there is

still salvage to be had by those willing to risk Imperial displeasure for desecrating a war grave.

Balzac was the origin world of an amphibious race dubbed "Crocodiles" by humans for their resemblance to the Terran creatures. Little is known about these people, including their name for themselves, as they became extinct long before the rise of the First Imperium.
Connections have been made with other, vaguely similar, races across Charted Space but no evidence exists that the Crocodiles of Balzac ever left their homeworld.
Artefacts indicate a low-tech society that apparently remained stable for many centuries before suddenly collapsing. Extinction followed within a few hundred years, although the reason is unknown. The best working theory is that the Crocodiles’ population was reduced below the survivable level by disease, destroying their civilization, the survivors eventually dwindling away to nothing.

A long year results in a roughly 150-day monsoon, followed by around 450 days of very dry weather.
The wet season can completely change a region, with vegetation appearing at an incredible rate and large carnivores coming out of hibernation to gorge on the riotous herbivorous life for a few weeks. Both predators and prey breed frantically and stock up on food before returning to their burrows when the rain stops. Within a few weeks, only twisted, desiccated and apparently dead vegetation remains.

DAWN Dawn is a large, dense planet entirely covered in very deep oceans. Thought to be a failed gas giant, Dawn has a high surface gravity – 1.7g – which, along with its dense, oxygen-rich atmosphere, makes the world highly uncomfortable for unadapted humans. As a result, there are more people living at the starport or on Dawn’s four moons than on the mainworld itself.

Dawn is best thought of as a complex multi-body system than a single planet. The highport is home to a mostly offworld population, made up of workers, business owners and their families. Some hail from the communities of Dawn but most are transients whose world of citizenship is elsewhere. The port is an important link in the subsector’s economy and sees a great deal of traffic. It also functions as a hub for the planet-and-moons system.

The mainworld itself is populated by around 200,000 people who live in floating cities. Their primary industry is fishing, as might be expected, along with related

activities such as harvesting the vast floating mats of seaweed that drift atop Dawn’s oceans. There is little resource extraction, other than processing of the ocean water for dissolved minerals. With no useable land at all and seabed mining requiring operations at incredible depths, Dawn’s small industrial sector finds it easier to import minerals from the moons or outside the system.

The four moons, together with the highport, are home to around 200,000 people. The moon cities are primarily resource-extraction and industrial sites, relying on Dawn’s planetary population for food whilst they produce necessary goods for use and for export. The system works well enough that standards of living throughout the planet-moon system are high, although other than the spectacular sunrises for which the world is named there is little reason for visitors to go planetside.

There are exceptions to this rule. Imperial armed forces sometimes conduct high-gravity training on Dawn and have experimented with deep-water operations from time-to-time. Scientific expeditions arrive occasionally, intent on mapping the seabed or sending robotic probes to investigate its composition. If Dawn really is a failed gas giant then its highly dense rocky core might reveal secrets about the formation of other, successful, gas giant worlds.

LILAD Like Dawn, Lilad is a system of bodies rather than a single planet. The largest moon of a gas giant, Lilad is the capital of its local moon system. The system has a total population of around 80 billion, of whom more than half live on Lilad itself.

Although cold, Lilad is habitable and has a modest native ecosystem supplemented by a few imported species. Lilad is able to grow enough food locally to supply its own population and that of the other moons, although this leads to a repetitive diet composed mainly of cereals and yeast extracts. Food is a sought-after import item, particularly fruit. Even dried and preserved fruits are popular so long as they are strongly flavoured and somewhere close to ‘authentic’ in taste.

The Lilad Group, as the moon system is officially named, does not have a central highport as such. Each of the moons has its own small port, with a large but

rather basic commercial docking facility orbiting over Lilad itself. Shuttles and small craft flit back and forth between these installations, protected by a large force of fighters and armed small craft, backed up by missile-
armed defence bases on the surface of the primary moons and many other smaller, uninhabited bodies.

The system defence flotilla at Lilad is adept at hiding among the many moons and ring-system debris and in the upper atmosphere of the gas giant. The favoured method of dealing with intruders is a time-on-target missile salvo from several points, though the tactic of using missiles to chase a target into a close-range torpedo ambush is also practiced. The occasional corsair does try his luck, but the Lilad Group is an unhealthy place to operate and most smart raiders know it.

PIKHA Pikha is a high-tech, high-population world, making it important to the subsector’s economy. This is unfortunate for other nearby worlds, as Pikha’s extremely bureaucratic government imposes complex regulations on all imports, exports and technology transfers. Doing business at Pikha is necessary but also painfully slow and needlessly complex.

The Pikha system is extensively colonized, with cities on several of the terrestrial bodies and in the planetoid belt too. These are not independent communities; they are subject to the same central government as any city on the mainworld. This is not without its problems, as there have been insurrections in the past and at any given time at least one city is subject to low-level agitation and protests against some aspect of governance.

In-system traffic is constant and complex, with large and small freighters plying between mines and industrial sites and commercial flights between worlds taken for granted by most inhabitants. The vulnerability of all this shipping requires that Pikha maintain a strong in-system security presence. Its shipyards cannot build jump-capable vessels but sublight liners and freighters are a speciality, with a steady stream of orders for patrol craft as well. Pikha’s system squadron is biased towards piracy suppression and law enforcement rather than defence of the mainworld; other than a large planetoid-
hulled monitor the squadron is entirely made up of small patrol vessels of 400 tons or less.

CAPTAIN, PILOT, ENGINEERS X 2, MAINTENANCE X 2

THOUSAND FREIGHTER

The Thousand Freighter is an in-system vessel built around a 1000-ton cargo hold; all other functions are dedicated to moving this hold and its contents around the system. The vessel is normally operated by a small crew and typically just one or two passengers will be aboard on any given trip. More can be carried if the crew move into double-occupancy but most Thousand Freighters have one or two ‘guest rooms’
and fill the rest up with the belongings of the crew, spare parts and whatever else is lying around. These ships have a reputation for being a very basic form of transport but they move cargo cheaply and efficiently, which is all their operators really care about.

### KAMLAR AND

###### VAST HEAVENS

### DENEB-SUBSECTOR O & P

Other than a small group of worlds in the spinward-
coreward corner of Kamlar, both Kamlar and Vast Heavens are part of the Great Rift, with very few star systems. Kamlar is nominally part of the Duke of Zeng’s area of interest, whilst Vast Heavens lies beyond the influence of the Denebian dukes.

Kamlar’s worlds are part of the Imperium, with the exception of Catacomb (which still aligns itself to the Imperium). Although they lie on the fringe of the Great Rift they look ‘inward’, towards other inhabited worlds, rather than out into the darkness. There are exceptions; a few long-range ships make the trip to Catacomb or conduct deep-space research. However, for the most part these worlds are little different from any others within the Imperium, other than reduced traffic through their starports and less passing trade.

The Duke of Zeng maintains a mobile embassy in Kamlar most of the time, an old demilitarised cruiser outfitted to act as a flying palace and conference centre.
Along with a handful of escorts, the embassy ranges among the worlds of Kamlar, sometimes returning to Zeng to deal with matters requiring urgent attention.
Court is held at the embassy by members of the Duke’s

close family or representatives trusted to act for him and, very occasionally, by the Duke of Zeng himself.

Vast Heavens receives no such attention. Containing just two worlds, one of which is a client state and the other completely independent, it lies beyond the area of interest of the local nobility other than when events at Capital require a noble to take notice of events out in the Great Rift. This is a very rare occurrence.

KAMLAR Kamlar was acquired as a colony by Pikha early in the Imperial expansion into the region. Plans to develop the world never really came to anything but Pihka is reluctant to let the possession go or permit outsiders to get involved in its development. As a result, most of the world is untamed wilderness, with a diverse and flourishing ecosystem containing a mix of indigenous and introduced species. It is extensively covered in water, possessing three great oceans. The dense atmosphere ensures rainfall is heavy in most regions and many low-lying areas are chronically waterlogged. This suits the local wildlife; Kamlar has many amphibian species of which some are very dangerous.

Away from the wetlands, dense forest predominates in non-mountainous areas. The forests and high peaks alike are home to a vast array of flying creatures, most unique to the world. A few flying species have moved into the small cities of Kamlar, nesting atop tall buildings and occasionally posing a hazard to grav traffic.

The cities are home to almost all of Kamlar’s human population, with just a few thousand dwelling in outlying regions. Most are employed in tourism or tourism-
related industries; some visitors want to hunt – which can be really quite dangerous – whilst others would be distressed at coming across a successful hunting party.
The solution is to separate these activities, which also dictates how the local wildlife is controlled. Sporting reservations are kept clear of dangerous animals as far as possible, whilst teams capture and move the most impressive into the hunting reserves.

LORIN ANTUNE The Lorin Antune system was named in honor of a wrecked freighter, presumed to have suffered a major misjump, found in 120. The ship had been in the system since -30 and the crew were dead. They appear to have survived for many years – the captain’s last journal entry was in 110, just a decade before Imperial scouts arrived in the system.

The crew of the Antune managed to land their crippled ship – more or less – and found themselves among a low-tech human society subdivided into many warring states. The knowledge of the crew and some of their cargo were sufficient to allow one of the states to break out of the cycle of success then betrayal by its allies and achieve a measure of stability. Over time this resulted in a reduction in conflict and technological progress to TL7. The world is still balkanised but does not experience anything like the degree of warfare it previously suffered. However, wars tend to be more destructive as they are now fought with higher-
technology weaponry.

There is a popular legend that Lorin Antune was the secret last refuge of the Humbolt family and that they remain powerful there, sending out agents to advance plans across the sector. Such claims are embroidered with tales of hidden shipyards building vast super-
dreadnoughts and other incredible devices. This seems rather unlikely; if Vincennes itself could not build these weapons then a fleeing remnant of its ruling class would be unable to secretly build an even more advanced technological base. Besides, no sign has ever been found of Humbolt influence on Lorin Antune.

Using a 400-ton hull, this ship is the raiding vessel of choice for the corsair bands of the Vargr Extents. Despite being of sophisticated design, it is by no means an unusual sight in Vargr space and border regions and one feared by many Travellers.
The advanced corsair typically has a crew of 10 but can carry up to 14 additional crewmembers with double occupancy, usually raiders and boarding party members.
With a maneuver drive powerful enough to run down all but the fastest ships, the average merchant is well-advised to surrender early when pursued by this vessel.

DESCRIPTION

both speed and stealth, perfectly suited for swift planetary assaults and ground support. Corsairs will typically use them to launch raids upon settlements before beating a hasty retreat. When combined with a low-emissions corsair vessel as a launching platform, the first a lower tech society might know of the Vargr is the low whine of the Ghoerruegh’s engines.
