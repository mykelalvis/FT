# ARAMIS SUBSECTOR

![[BtC-AramisSubsector.jpg|500]]
[[BtC-AramisSubsector.jpg|Aramis]]

The Aramis subsector lies at the coreward edge of [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]]. To trailing is the [[Pretoria subsector]] in [[Deneb Sector|Deneb]], [[Imperium|Imperial]] territory, but coreward is the [[Vargr Extents]]. Most [[Vargr]] incursions in the four [[Frontier Wars]], and most corsair raids today, come through this subsector. As a result, the 214th Fleet, tasked with protection of [[Traveller/Locations/Sectors/Spinward Marches Sector Systems/Aramis Subsector Systems/Aramis|Aramis]], attempts to control access to the rest of the sector.

The [[Aramis subsector]] is generally divided into three astrographical areas: the [[Towers Cluster]] , the [[Aramis Trace]],  and the [[Scatters]] (all the remaining worlds).

This activity is mainly concentrated on the rimward end of the subsector. The fleet is based out of [[Paya]], [[Natoko]] and [[L'Oeul d'Dieu]], clearly demonstrating the Navy's lack of interest in the relatively unimportant worlds further coreward. Navy ships do sweep the more coreward systems but not anything like as frequently as the rimward ones.

Aramis subsector is a major agricultural area with substantial markets for its produce among the neighboring [[Vargr]], who find the wide variety of locally produced foodstuffs to be highly desirable luxury goods. The [[Imperium|Imperial]] government has established several trading stations along the border to encourage this commerce, with the ultimate aim of economically tying the nearby [[Vargr]] to the [[Imperium]], lessening the chance of their joining the [[Zhodani]] in a new war. Produce comes to the stations from all over the subsector: [[Vargr]] trading delegations converge on the stations and trade raw materials, metals, and manufactured goods for desirable meats, spices, and other delicacies. Major trading stations are maintained at [[Lablon]], [[Jesedipere]], and [[Junidy]]. Smaller stations are maintained at [[Zila]] and [[Focaline]] for trade in the local products of these worlds.

[[Focaline]]'s major industry is [[groat]]-raising: both cloth and unprocessed groat hair are exported, and groat meat is considered a delicacy by the [[Vargr]].

The wine of [[Zila]] has an excellent reputation; recent vintages have been critically acclaimed throughout the Marches. [[Pysadi]], on the other hand, is under a religious dictatorship which forbids the production of alcohol in any form; although Pysadian fruits, especially its skymelons and [[trake]]s, are of superb quality, very little wine is made from them, and all of that offworld.

Critics of the [[Imperial]] system of government like to point out that the [[Marquis of Aramis]] is a member of the Tukera family and [[Tukera]] is one of the main Imperial megacorporations. They suggest that it is not coincidence that [[Traveller/Locations/Sectors/Spinward Marches Sector Systems/Aramis Subsector Systems/Aramis]] itself has a naval base and is flanked by two others. [[Imperial Navy]] officials (and the office of the [[Marquis of Aramis]]) dismiss this as a typical example of paranoid anti-establishment ranting.

[[Junidy]] is the homeworld of a minor race called the [[Llellewyoly]], colloquially known as 'Dandelions' as a result of their appearance. They are an oddball species falling somewhere between plants and animals, with a highly complex social order that routinely baffles outsiders.

[[Yebab]] is home to the [[Ebokin]].  The [[Ebokin]] are of very little importance in Imperial affairs but [[Yebab]] is represented in the same manner as other Imperial worlds.

Ten worlds in the subsector are [[Amber Zone]]d; [[Zila]], [[Rugbird]], [[Towers]], [[Corfu]], [[Junidy]], [[Zykoca]], [[Aramanx]], [[Pysadi]], [[Dhian]] and [[Reacher]], and the only Red Zone is [[Lewis]]. As usual, the reasons for the [[Red Zone]]s are not publicly available.

Aramis subsector contains 26 worlds with a total popuiation of 31.3 billion. The highest population is 28 billion, at [[Junidy]]; the highest tech level is D, at [[Lewis]]. All worlds in the [[Aramis subsector]] are members of the [[Imperium]].
