# PRINX

Located on the outer spinward edge of [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]], Prinx is a small world with a very thin atmosphere that is borderline-breathable to humans at sea level; that is to say, a person without a compressor mask could function for a short period before collapsing. During this time, which would be acutely uncomfortable, the victim would display increasingly severe symptoms of altitude sickness such as confusion, nausea and dizziness.  Local animals, such as they are, have adapted to these conditions or evolved in them and are not affected.

The local wildlife is somewhat limited. There are no birds or other flying creatures; the air is too thin to support them. Most larger animals are water-breathers, with few species on land. These are mostly primitive crawling creatures, with few species larger than a cat or small dog.

Much of Prinx' surface is entirely uninhabitable.  With such a thin atmosphere, mountains tend not to be eroded and remain sharp-toothed barriers to exploration. There is less soil than on worlds with thicker atmospheres and while this does not greatly affect life in the valleys, highlands tend to be stark and rugged, with little or no vegetation. The surface temperature is also low on average, so that in many areas seas freeze to a considerable depth and ice caps cover the land, greatly reducing usable real estate available to humans.

The settlement of Prinx was a classic example of a landgrab that could not be properly supported. The colonists arrived after a long and difficult journey and began setting up home on their new world which, if not outright hostile, was not as welcoming as the mission planners had believed. At least one follow-up mission arrived before the project was curtailed and resources diverted to opening up more rewarding worlds.

As a result, the colonists on Prinx were left to go their own way. They did reasonably well, creating a stable society that gradually expanded to cover an entire subcontinent. Over the centuries, the population grew slowly until the present-day level of several million inhabitants was reached. Equilibrium was reached some time ago and, with no population pressure to force expansion, movement outward came to a complete halt.

The subcontinent today know as Lesser Dantterland is well settled and 'tamed' for agriculture and there are scattered settlements across Greater Dantterland. The rest of the planet is uninhabited and virgin territory.

Within Lesser Dantterland, government is by a semi-hereditary ruling caste descended from the original colony leaders. Succession is only semi-hereditary as a ruler can adopt several unrelated individuals into his or her household, who are thereafter considered to be family and eligible for nomination as heirs, representatives and holders of high office; heirs are less often blood relatives than adopted household members for a variety of complex social reasons.

Prinx was settled by Imperials and, much later, became nominally part of the Consulate. Today, it is once again independent, although most of the population are not aware of the difference. Zhodani merchant ships (and the odd military patrol) out of Sansibar come through the port from time-to-time. Imperial ships are less common, although they are not unknown and Darrian vessels are increasingly frequent.

Some of these ships are en route elsewhere, others come to trade. Offworld trade is not critically important to the economy of Prinx, although it brings in luxury goods and hard cash in return for a range of plant products and minerals.

Darrian ships used to be very rare in Prinxport but since the middle of the 1050s long-range vessels have begun arriving, coming for three distinct purposes, most commonly to trade; this seems odd, since reaching Prinx from Darrian space requires a jump-3 vessel and the operators surely cannot be making money on their trips.  Yet still they come.

Other ships pass through and onto Foreven sector to spinward, presumably headed for the coreward end of the sector. The third group appear to be exploration vessels.  They stop at Prinxport, then conduct surveying operations over the uninhabited continents of the planet. Queries about what these vessels are looking for are met with politely vague answers about 'ongoing survey projects' and 'researching planetary crust behaviour' that do not serve to enlighten and are obviously not meant to.

Whatever the Darrians may be up to on Prinx, the locals are not bothered by it. The Darrian crews that come through Prinxport are friendly and courteous, bring in a little offworld cash and do no harm while they are there.  If they want to go surveying ice sheets or mountain ranges, that is their business. The locals have all the land they need and a fair bit more; the rest of the planet is somebody else's problem.
