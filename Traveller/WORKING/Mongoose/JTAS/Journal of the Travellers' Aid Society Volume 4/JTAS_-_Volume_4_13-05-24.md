TRADE AND COMMERCE
Sooner or later in the career of the typical Referee, a group of Travellers
is going to stumble across the rules pertaining to trade and commerce.
When this happens, nine times out of ten the Referee is fated to watch
the familiar forms of these Travellers change with the inevitability of
a werewolf under the full moon as they become consumed with the
overriding urge to become merchant princelings of deep space.
```

```
Some get over it soon and go back to being devil-may-care mercenaries,
happily quoting muzzle velocities and rates of fire and never giving a
second thought to cargo and brokerage rates. But others never recover;
they can be recognized by their battered calculators worn down by
frequent percentile comparisons, hands clenched from rolling dice for
cargoes and, above all, the look of pure, unadulterated greed gleaming
in their eyes as they recite that favourite question, ‘what types of cargos
can we pick up here?’.
```

```
The Referee, however, faces a much harder set of questions. How does
one keep up a series of exciting adventures while the Travellers want to
spend all their time buying and selling cargo? What approaches exist
to limit their growing wealth (without intervening too bluntly), in order to
avoid having them becoming multi-millionaires who do not give a hoot
about adventuring anymore?
```

```
COMMERCE AND ADVENTURE
Travellers who carry cargo and passengers for hire are, of course, engaged
in commerce but the rules are rather carefully balanced to render it very
difficult to make much of a profit. Even if there are no bank payments to
be made on the ship then maintenance, life support, fuel, supplies, major
repairs and similar expenses drain a large part revenues earned, making
it necessary for the group to take occasional ‘adventuring’ jobs to make
ends meet. Keeping the Travellers in need of money is a solid foundation
upon which campaigns frequently rest. Why else would the Travellers risk
life and limb, if not for personal gain? There are, of course, other good
motivations, but greed is most common and can be most readily identified
with!
```

```
Enter the rules on speculative trade.
```

```
These rules permit the Travellers to start with some seed money (which
they can almost always raise) and, with a little care, turn it into a fortune.
This is not to say that they cannot lose their shirts while engaged in
speculation but Travellers with even a handful of smarts will plan routes
to suit their cargo and maximise profit potential. More often than not, such
```

Travellers will be turning a profit, which can quickly snowball through
further careful planning.

Moreover, those Travellers who go about the process right will have
a tendency to focus on speculation to the exclusion of all else. If this
happens, the Referee may find themselves spending more time
regulating speculation dice rolls than in administering an adventure or
campaign. There are some ways to deal with this, however. The options
can be used to suit circumstances and need not be exclusive of any
other option. Ideally, most or all of these approaches should be used in
an ongoing campaign to keep things moving.

GO WITH THE FLOW

The first option is also the simplest – let the Travellers have their
way. This is best done when they first get involved in speculation and
continued until things get ridiculous. Actually, trade and speculation is
a good transitional ploy to break up adventures; after all, the Travellers
cannot face death and destruction every day of their lives – and they
cannot save the galaxy eight times a week (twice on Sundays). So, a
little intermittent commerce serves as a good way of earning a breathing
spell. While it lasts, the Travellers can rebuild the finances, find useful
items of equipment or information as they travel and not actually realise
that they are not really doing anything. The Referee can use this time
to start preparing a new adventure to spring on the Travellers later on.
Indeed, commercial travelling can be turned to the Referee’s advantage.
Properly handled, it can be used to lead the Travellers by the nose to a
specific destination. To do this, the Referee must be the one to make all
trade and speculation dice rolls (and in secret) and must be willing to
ignore some results in favour of those that further the cause.

Let us look at District 268 in the Spinward Marches as an example. The
Travellers have a far trader and start at Mertactor, at the end of the trade
routes from the Glisten subsector of the Imperium. The Referee has plans
for an adventure involving asteroid mining in the Bowman asteroid belt
eight parsecs away. Now, a patron might ordinarily be used to charter the
ship for a flight to Bowman but a more subtle way to get the group there
is through manipulation of the trade rules.

The Travellers start with a little money to invest but they want to make
a profit through trade and speculation. The Referee ponders, pretends
to randomly create a cargo and announces that the cargo is common
raw materials – inexpensive, available in quantity and with a high resale
value on a poor world. Talos, one jump away, just happens to be poor.

At Talos, the Travellers sell the steel (hopefully at a profit). They find a
load of petrochemicals; looking at their options, they see that Tarkine,
one week away, will pay them well for such chemicals. At Tarkine, the
cargo found might be polymers or advanced machine parts, which can
be bought there for a low price and sold for a profit on a non industrial

world. Here they have three options as to destination – Binges, Forine or
Flexos. To help them decide, the Referee weights the odds by planting a
rumor that a large number of polymers have been shipped from Flexos
recently. This should encourage the Travellers to voyage there.
```

```
At Flexos, the promised cargo proves not to be available. There are,
however, rumors of a rich strike in the Bowman system. There might
also be a patron, who could charter the ship to carry supplies to the
system to help outfit a mining expedition. In this way, the Travellers have
made exactly the same voyage they would have made if they had been
hired back at Mertactor but they have made money while doing it and felt
themselves in complete control of their destinies at all times, although
the Referee has, in reality, been directing every step of their travels.
```

```
The Referee may use the trade and commerce rules in a judicious
manner to produce a required set of results. However what about those
times when trade and commerce is interfering with normal adventuring?
There are always possibilities...
```

THE FICKLE FINGER OF FATE

Travellers can lose their shirts by buying high and selling low, although,
as we have seen, this can be minimised by sound planning. For instance,
Travellers rarely go very wrong by hiring a good broker, since the broker
adds to their profit while taking only a fraction of the sale price. This is
always a good deal, so the Travellers will probably be making money
if they are even a little bit smart about how they operate. The Referee,
however, also has options, being in control of the ‘slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune’. When the Travellers start ignoring adventure
possibilities, or look like they might amass enough money to upset the
campaign, then it is time for fate to take a hand.

Consider the various possibilities open to the Referee. The Travellers might
run across a crooked broker who swindles them out of a sizable amount of
money; They might have most of their operating capital tied up in a cargo
of gems when pirates show up to hijack the loot. They might knowingly or
unknowingly violate a local customs regulation, causing confiscation of
the cargo or even their ship. Their starship could suffer a malfunction or
breakdown that costs them most of their ready capital to repair.

Such events can have many purposes. First, they can knock out
unreasonably large profits and keep the Travellers struggling to earn
a living. That is useful. Second, it helps keep the Travellers humble.
Perhaps in the future they will not tie up all their assets into something
that can vanish at a single stroke. Forcing them to diversify will keep
them from snowballing assets quite so fast.

Finally, these options lead squarely back into the realm of adventuring
and that is where the action is. They may take it in mind to track down the
crooked broker or pirates. The customs office may propose restoration
of ship and cargo in exchange for completion of a hazardous mission.
The breakdown may be at a particularly embarrassing moment when the
results could be really drastic for all concerned. It is up to the Referee
to be the balance wheel for the flow of the campaign, creating obstacles
with one hand and opportunities with the other.

It should never become a standard policy to take away the money the
Travellers have earned without giving them a chance to do something
about it. Travellers do not like to see their money vanish without being
able to put up a fight. This can be good motivation to keep them involved
in exciting adventures and the act of recovering a lost investment may
legitimately cut down profits to a manageable level.

MERCHANT PRINCES

There is a course of action that a Referee should be willing to explore.
This is to allow the Travellers to make the fortune they seek (and to keep
it) but run things in such a way as to set the stage for adventures of a new

```
and unusual type. Here the object is to let the Travellers build up a small
commercial concern of their own and then run it.
```

```
As profits from small scale speculation begin to mount, the Referee
can urge an expansion in several ways. Government regulations
might be used to encourage investment in an additional ship or two,
or they might get a chance to acquire controlling interest in an entire
shipping company. Now at this point it gets tricky, for the Referee will
have trouble controlling the campaign if the Travellers decide to split up
and conduct trading in person. They should be encouraged, instead, to
run the business from an established headquarters and let individual
ships make their own runs and turn profit. The Referee can set-up
and administer the operations of a shipping line without a great deal
of trouble, once it is established what worlds are being serviced, what
ships are employed, what competitors are involved and so forth. Each
month, the Travellers can be presented with a profit and loss statement
to let them know how their little company is doing.
```

```
The Travellers can be rewarded and still continue adventuring. This last
bit is important – if you want to keep your Travellers interested, you must
keep up their involvement in the campaign. Look to new horizons, offer
new challenges and your campaign will be a successful one.

GAMAAGIN KAASHUKIIN
Gamaagin Kaashukiin, heir to the Barony of Klavos on Adabicci/Lunion,
served with distinction in the Imperial Navy. An honors graduate
from the Lunion Naval Academy, she went on to flight school, serving
several years as a fighter pilot aboard the frontier cruiser Children of the
Marches. Eventually, she transferred to a line post and held a variety of
commands, mostly small ships in the 400-2,000 ton range.

Shortly before the Fifth Frontier War began, her father died, leaving her
the Barony of Klavos. Gamaagin resigned her commission to go home to
her new fief and oversee the transition. While there, she met, fell in love
with, and became engaged to Simon, Baron Dacres.

However, only weeks before the scheduled wedding, as Dacres was
returning to Adabicci from business on Tenalphi, the war broke out. The
liner on which Dacres was travelling was ambushed by a Sword Worlds
commerce raider, the 800-ton Excalibur. Although the liner surrendered,
Dacres attempted to organise a resistance to the boarding party and
was killed. Other passengers and crew were set adrift in a small boat; on
being rescued, they passed on the story.

Gamaagin was horror-struck at the death of her fiancé. After days of
mourning, still in shock over the incident, bitter thoughts of vengeance
began to stir within her. She resolved to do everything in her power to
avenge herself against the Sword Worlders who had ruined her life.
Baroness Klavos decided to return to active duty.

To raise money for a ship, Gamaagin was forced to sell the Klavos
fief (the family fortune was far from sufficient for her needs). No
longer Baroness Klavos, she was (once again) Captain Kaashukiin,
commanding a Broadsword-class mercenary cruiser purchased from
a defunct mercenary outfit. Originally the Boomerang, the ship was re-
named Retribution by Kaashukiin.

Using old contacts in the Imperial Navy, she arranged to have her ship
and crew hired as mercenaries, and began a campaign of raiding along
the Sword Worlds frontier.

The Travellers can run into Captain Kaashukiin in several ways. The
most obvious is for her to become an employer or patron. Retribution is
usually in need of crew members (former army and marine personnel
for her marine complement, navy or scout veterans for the command
crew, even merchants to act as prize agents, supply officers and so
forth). Kaashukiin will also be interested in Travellers with their own
vessel. Armed starships might be added to give her a flotilla, rather

than a single ship; merchantmen might be approached to act as decoys
to set-up an ambush of Sword Worlds commerce raiders.
```

```
She can also be introduced, if the Referee desires, as a potential employee.
If Retribution were lost by accident or in combat but her captain survived,
Kaashukiin might be willing to hire out as a pilot until she can recoup her
losses and get a fresh chance to seek her goal. Kaashukiin is a skilled
naval officer, highly competent and very capable. She tends, however, to
be blinded by her desire for vengeance. Her main goal in life is to find
the Excalibur and she will forsake all else to do this. Her crew, hired on
for shares of the proceeds from prizes taken, do not like the occasional
diversions to follow up a rumor of the enemy raider but they have tolerated
her eccentricities so far because her voyages pay well.
```

```
Adventures involving Kaashukiin’s hunt for Excalibur are numerous.
Ordinary operations (attacks on Sword World merchant shipping, raids
against isolated outposts, deep penetrations of occupied territory and
so on) are a good source for excitement. Crew discontent at passing
up some particularly lucrative prize could lead to a mutiny, with the
Travellers having to choose between the two sides. The Travellers
might be among the personnel assigned as prize crew to a captured
ship, with the task of navigating it back to a friendly Class A starport for
sale of ship and cargo, the bread-and-butter of this sort of operation.
Such a voyage is, of course, fraught with danger.
```

```
Finally, there is the possibility of confronting Excalibur. Like Retribution,
she is an 800-ton mercenary cruiser and adventures could take the
form of a cat and mouse chase across the stars with the advantage
swinging from one ship to the other. By the time a final confrontation
takes place, the Travellers could be very familiar with a ship that has
become their nemesis.

MAINSTRIDER 300T
The 300T is a member of the Mainstrider family of vessels originally
marketed by Enguezzi Interstellar, a now-defunct shipbuilding firm. The
300T designation refers to hull size and intended role; in this case general
trade. Vessels in the Mainstrider family are still manufactured under a
variety of licenses, with fees going to the liquidators of the original firm
and families of key personnel. Unlicensed variants also appear from time
-to-time, usually under a different designation.

The Mainstrider range was triumphantly marketed as ‘striding along
the mains, striding between the mains’, a claim that was overstated
but not entirely unjustified. The 300T has a capability of one parsec per
jump but can make two or three consecutive jumps without preparation
or modification. This comes at the cost of a slight reduction in cargo
capacity but gives the ship great flexibility when operating between small
clusters or in regions of low stellar density.

The Mainstrider 300T is a rugged and dependable transport, offering
modest self-defence along with the flexibility to cross between mains
when necessary. It cannot compete, in terms of efficiency, with a pure
jump-1 cargo vessel but can reach markets such a vessel could not.
It is also readily customisable, allowing users to tailor their vessel to
local conditions.

The 300T uses the characteristic hull form of most Mainstrider ships,
said by some to resemble ‘the ungodly child of a Gazelle-class close
escort and a subsidised merchant’. When landed, the vessel sits on its
secondary cargo units and short landing legs deployed from the sides of
the forward lower hull. Entry to the ship is at the rear of the main cargo
area for loading and at the front of the lower hull for personnel.

FUEL/CARGO SYSTEM

The key to the vessel’s flexibility is its use of dual-purpose fuel/cargo
containers. Part of the vessel’s cargo capacity is of a standard design,
using a dedicated fuel tank with sufficient capacity to support a one-
parsec jump plus a few weeks of power plant operation. The additional
fuel required to make a second or third jump without refuelling is carried
instead of cargo. Obviously, the 300T takes twice as long to cross a
two-parsec gap as a dedicated jump-2 vessel but it costs less and can
switch its auxiliary fuel tanks back to cargo space when operating on a
jump-1 main or in a cluster.

Fuel/cargo containers are a permanent part of the vessel and obviously
must be suitably shaped to permit non-liquid cargo to be carried. It is

### 10

```
possible to retrofit cargo space or fuel tanks to dual-use containers but
this can be a problem on some vessels. Where fuel is carried in oddly-
shaped tanks fitted around other components or where the cargo bay is
used to give access to other parts of the ship, conversion is not feasible.
The pumping and containment systems for fuel also occupy space that
could otherwise be used for cargo, fuel and other systems. Thus most
vessels that use fuel/cargo modules are normally designed that way from
the outset.
```

```
The fuel/cargo modules are self-contained and sealed by their own
bulkheads. Swapping from fuel tankage to cargo space requires little
more than flushing out the tanks to ensure no liquid hydrogen remains,
then loading them up with cargo as needed. Each ton of capacity in a
cargo/fuel container requires 0.05 tons of additional equipment and costs
Cr5000 per ton. Thus a fuel/cargo container capable of carrying 100 tons
takes up 105 tons of displacement and costs Cr500000.

MAIN HULL (UPPER MAIN HULL)
The main hull of the 300T takes the form of a rounded-off and elongated
cuboid, configured in a conventional manner. The bridge, electronics and
computer systems are located forward, with the primary turret (mounting
dual pulse lasers) accessed via a hatch in the ceiling of the eight ton
crew common area that is immediately aft of the bridge. Six crew cabins
are aft of this area, beyond which lies the engineering area. Proportions
are roughly equal between the forward section containing the 20-ton
bridge plus 32-ton crew area and the aft section containing 30.5 tons of
drives and power plant. This is because the primary fuel tank, containing
sufficient capacity for one jump-1 and 16 weeks of operation, is wrapped
around the drive spaces.
```

PASSENGER/CARGO AREA

```
(LOWER MAIN HULL)
Along the ventral surface of the primary hull lies a slightly shorter
secondary hull also taking the form of a round-fronted cuboid. The
primary cargo area is at the rear of this segment, containing 56 tons of
cargo stowage and the handling crane. The cargo bay can be used as a
secondary airlock and is often depressurised when carrying passengers
for security reasons.
```

```
Forward of the cargo bay is the passenger area, containing six staterooms
and a 16-ton common area, which acts as a reception chamber when
passengers board through the primary airlock located at the front of this
hull section. Entry to the lower hull is by way of secure elevator and
stairwell leading from a point between the cargo and passenger areas
up into the main deck. This chamber also allows movement between the
cargo and passenger areas when necessary.
```

CARGO/FUEL CONTAINERS

```
(THE SADDLE)
The cargo/fuel containers sit at the rear of the main and lower hulls, one
30-ton container to each side. Each has a rounded front and a set of
cargo doors facing rearwards, enabling the whole aft of the ship to be
opened to receive cargo. The way the containers are streamlined into the
main hull gives some observers the impression of a saddle; as a result
this part of the ship is often referred to in that manner.
```

```
The cargo/fuel containers are two decks high and streamlining at the front
of the ‘saddle’ includes space for fuel scoops and processors. The bottom
of each container is slightly lower than the main hull, allowing them to act
as large feet when the ship is landed. Most of the ship’s weight rests
on them, creating relatively low ground pressure, with additional support
from lighter legs extended out and down from the lower main hull.
```

### 15

The containers can be accessed from the main cargo bay or engineering
area when not carrying fuel. Atop each is a small bulge supporting a
hardpoint and a one-ton missile magazine. These mounts carry a missile
rack and beam laser as standard, giving a modest but broad self-defence
capability. The turrets are normally remote controlled from the bridge but
can be directly crewed. This requires crawling through a tight accessway
along the top of the saddle and is not popular with crewmembers
assigned to maintain the equipment. The magazines – and the turrets
themselves – are sometimes used as secure cargo storage or places to
stash items beyond the reach of other crewmembers.

OPERATING CONSIDERATIONS

The 300T is a versatile and relatively comfortable ship to operate. Its
primary economic advantage is its ability to move between mains and
clusters, and operate at profit in regions of lower stellar density. Within
a cluster or on a main the 300T is outperformed by the more common
free trader and subsidised merchant, however where it can set-up a run
requiring a mix of one and two parsec jumps it can outperform a jump-
ship in the long term – though it is slow by comparison.

PERFORMANCE

The performance of the 300T is modest but not disappointing given its price
tag. Critics have claimed its minimal armor is a waste of tonnage – more
or none would have given advantages. However, the designers countered
this allegation by stating that the extra protection on the hull reduced long-
term costs by decreasing flexing and protecting against micrometeorite
damage. Crews of those vessels that actually came under fire would also
tend to agree that any armor is better than no armor.

The ship’s 2-g thrust pushes costs up compared to a minimal ‘cargo
van’ vessel but does have advantages when operating in the frontier
environment the 300T is best suited to. Quicker transits to and from orbit
mean less chances to encounter trouble of the official and unofficial kind.
A 300T cannot outrun a navy ship but may be able to evade a converted
free trader long enough to enter jump. The higher thrust is also useful
when doing odd jobs within a star system.

The low ground pressure resulting from having such big feet is useful
at badly-maintained low-end starports or when conducting exploratory
operations. Coupled with the ability to throw open the whole of the
rear cargo area, this allows a 300T operator to use the ship as a flying
bazaar if desired. However, the main advantage of this vessel over
conventional ships is its ability to transit between stellar clusters and
still operate at profit, whilst reaching places other vessels in the same
price range cannot.

### 16

```
VARIANTS
The standard configuration is designed for security and passengers
are confined to half the lower main hull with no access to critical
systems. Some operators squeeze extra passengers into the crew
staterooms, doubling up where necessary to free-up space. Others gut
the passenger area and convert it into additional cargo space. This
gives a maximum of 116 tons in the main cargo area and an additional
60 tons in the cargo/fuel containers.
```

```
One or both of the cargo/fuel containers can be converted to other
functions if necessary. An upgunned ‘expedient patrol/escort vessel’
variant is available, using the cargo modules as hangars for a pair of light
fighters each side. A planetary exploration variant was also marketed by
Enguezzi Interstellar before they went bust, using part of the lower hull
passenger area for laboratories and carrying vehicles instead of cargo.
Unofficial variants have included prospecting ships, Q-ship pirate hunters
and mobile headquarters for small business groups.

### 17

THE WAYS OF KUZU
I am Aslan, a warrior of Hoaawli‘ukhtai, of the clan Afaikhiyoi. I was born
on Kuzu (as humans say it), the place of coming, in the city of U’khai-of-
the-Red-Dawn. As the third eldest of my family’s sons, the shape of my
way was directed from my earliest days; I took the Ah’ukhtai, the Vow of
Heroes and rose through the ranks to become Leader of Clansmen of
a mercenary battle group, Kaha a’huye, the brotherhood of the Rose-
Tinged Waters. I have spent many years in the company of humans and
have a better understanding of their ways than most of my people.

There is an old and venerable saying that the true differences between
peoples lie within. I am not human but Aslan. The difference lies not in my
form but within my eaia, my inner self, my heart (as some humans might
translate it). It long puzzled me, when I first met those of Humaniti, that
some should expect me to act and react as they; that they should think me,
in some twisted fang way, as a human in mask and furred costume.

It is certain that humans and Aslan will fare together in their quests
across the galaxy and understanding – and taro in full on both hands –
is necessary if that faring is to be for good, rather than ill. It was for this
reason that a human friend, a huweihwoweiy, bade me write this, that
understanding between our peoples be increased. My friend promised
to give what I had written to a friend of his, who would make it known to
large numbers of Humaniti by means of this Journal.

Perhaps humans must always label what they do not understand with
concepts familiar to them (I am told this is called by your scholars
‘anthropomorphization’, a word which I have never been able to
pronounce). Upon hearing that Aslan ‘meditate’, they assume the custom
has some religious significance and that the devotees are somehow
otherworldly, removed from the thoughts and strivings of existence.

Nothing could be farther from the truth.

THOUGHTS SHAPE THE WAY

Ai yourhai is the first precept, the guiding philosophy of all of my people.
Its name might be translated roughly as ‘thoughts shape the way’, a
concept that surrounds and nurtures all Aslan grounded in their mother
culture. The symbol of ai yourhai is the Aslan hand with fighting claw
extended. The Aslan’s slashing fighting claw extends when it is needed
without conscious thought, seemingly of its own volition, because he is
what he is. The concept of ai yourhai states that the Aslan mind can
be so ordered, so strengthened, that proper actions always spring from
trained and proper thinking. This, in fact, is the purpose of meditation

### 18

```
among Aslan, to discipline and harden the mind, that actions – the strike
of arm and extended claw – be automatic and unerring. This meditation
```

- concentration in private for a time each day on deeds, writings and
litany chains of abstract thoughts – serves to sharpen concentration and
senses, eliminate the tendency to distraction and prepare the body to
respond to whatever demands may be made upon it.

```
‘Right thinking leads to right action’ one human writer described it and
it would be hard to improve upon those words. It must be remembered,
however, that the Aslan warrior does not dwell on the concept but
simply pursues it, for he does so knowing that thinking is not doing, as
doing is not achieving.
```

```
THE COMPANY OF HEROES
Ukhtai eaiawehi – ‘company of heroes’ – is a difficult concept for humans,
a belief that we are surrounded by a vast and unseen throng of those
who have gone before. It is not, as so many human xenosophontologists
insist, ancestor or spirit worship, or even a belief in ghosts (if I use that
word properly), although it is likely the notion had its origin in such beliefs
thousands of years ago. Aslan today do not believe in literal ghosts but
rather in the eaia, which might be translated as ‘genius’ or perhaps
‘embodied ideal’. While the eaia cannot be said to have any actual being
outside of its psychological reality within the Aslan mind, it is usually
referred to as an external presence.
```

```
Ukhtai eaiawehi teaches us not to abandon our comrades under any
circumstances, for we would be abandoned by the Unseen Company,
an inner banishment more lonely, more rending than any mere physical
exile. If one’s eaia cannot take its place with the Great Company, then
there is no place for it in the cosmos and no place for that Aslan with
his people.
```

```
THE SHRINE OF HEROES
The Shrine of Heroes is the closest thing to a place of worship for Aslan.
```

```
One can be found on nearly every ship, each military encampment,
every place where Aslan are gathered; even each household has a
family shrine for meditation and remembrance. The Shrine of Heroes is a
quiet and private place for personal meditation on the deeds, words and
persons of Aslan heroes. Relics or images called ahfa are kept there;
frequently 3D sight and sound recordings of special individuals can be
projected there for inspiration and instruction.
```

```
The Shrine of Heroes is a beautiful place; close, silent, hung with
tapestries or velvet curtains to exclude sound, and decorated with
scenes of battle or triumph. It is never large, for meditations are expected
to be private. Before battle, a military shrine will have a line of personnel
waiting to use it for a precious few minutes, for it is thought that one’s
```

### 19

skill and battle prowess is increased a thousand-fold if he enters battle
with his mind cleared and sharpened by the discipline of meditation, his
arm guided by the purpose of right thinking. Most Aslan carry their own
ahfa in a small pouch or chest, to be used especially when a Shrine
of Heroes is not available. Ahfa may be medallions, statuettes, scrolls
(detailing heroic deeds), a tuft of plant material or lump of soil from a
battlefield, anything that may serve as a focus of meditation by reminding
the warrior of his own deeds and those of his family and clan. A warrior’s
ahfa are considered to be, if not secret, at least best kept private, things
to be shared only with the closest of comrades.

WITH US IN SPIRIT

Aslan stress the purity of culture and philosophy that makes Aslan
what they are. It is for this reason that Aslan culture has remained
remarkably stable and unchanging across thousands of worlds where
we have settled, even where we have been thrown into close contact
with alien ideas and concepts. Huweihwoweiy might be translated as
‘with us in spirit’ and means that a person or a people act according to
the highest ideals of our philosophy. It is not a title lightly bestowed, for
it brings with it responsibility for a serious trust. The only higher honor
is formal adoption into an Aslan clan group – a ceremony that occurs
rarely, in extraordinary circumstances.

The term huweihwoweiy can be applied to any (Aslan or non-Aslan) who
strive or suffer or share with Aslan as brothers, who help them in need,

### 20

```
who do not desert them in danger or trouble, who stand by them and
willingly identify with them as of the People. Huweihwoweiy can join any
groups families or clan prides, towns or cities, even worlds with common
goals and a shared direction.
```

```
ANATHEMA
There are some things that no Aslan in his right mind would do. This is,
perhaps, an oversimplification; Aslan are as diverse in their individual
ways of thinking and behaviour as are humans. However these particular
acts are rare among the Aslan because the way they think shapes the
way they act – Ai yourhai.
```

```
Murder – that is, assassination without formal challenge; abandoning a
comrade in danger or in need; exchanging the life of others for one’s own
safety; blackening a good name; running from a challenge; these are the
deeds called rukhta, a word perhaps best translated as ‘anathema’ or
‘cursed’, although I have seen it rendered as ‘crimes of honor’ by some
human writers.
```

```
There are several hoaawli or ‘schools’ of behaviour, which demand
greater attention to duty, which place greater demands on the individual.
Usually these are associated with warrior groups and centre about a
secret creed or oath known only to initiates. Most of these add additional
rukhta to the common list; these may include such deeds as unnecessary
cruelty in a kill, unnecessary challenge for personal satisfaction or lust
for triumph, profaning one’s own ai with unworthy thoughts and a difficult
word for humans, rukhtiywe.
```

```
When humans say that cowardice is unknown among the Aslan, they
speak the truth. There literally is no word in any of our languages for this
concept ‘cowardice’, which few of us understand perfectly, even those
of us who have long associated with humans. The closest word in Aslan
might be rukhtiywe; there is no easy counterpart in any human tongue
with which I or my friend am familiar but the word embodies the concept
of denying one’s own Aslanness – one’s heritage, family and self, and as
such is certainly rukhta.
```

```
The bond of huweihwoweiy is shattered by rukhta and many hrurastea
(blood quests) are launched by individual Aslan seeking to clear their
names of the taint of rukht by finding and challenging the actual doer
of some dark deed. Modern customs do not admit to trial by death-
challenge and combat, but the practice is a common one nonetheless.
The idea of formal challenge, followed by potentially mortal combat, is
deeply rooted in our society.
```

```
IT COMES
Tarohaka literally means ‘the water that flows without being forced’ and
the philosophy of taro (‘it comes’) is considered a virtue among Aslan,
```

### 21

for patience can be the greatest weapon a hunter possesses. Humans
have a proverb, ‘all things come to him who waits’, and this is one of the
few human sayings fully understood by those of our people who hear it.
Taro is sharpened by meditation and is thought of as a constant struggle
against the dark nature of Aslan prehistory and id. The ancient call within
us calls for us to strike now and kill – but taro counsels patience, for the
perfect time will reveal itself and the strike will be sure, the kill clean.

This is a particularly powerful image for Aslan warriors; the imagery
evoked for us is the patient flowing of a trickle of water, which in the course
of years smooths jagged rocks to pebbles and over eons carved out vast
canyons. Many Aslan keep as ahfa a small stereograph of Ka’htesu or
of some other spectacular canyon or water carved rock formation in the
badlands of Kuzu, a reminder of the power of taro. Others find the same
understanding in a water worn pebble from the bank of a stream. The
concept of adventuring – going forth as travellers in search of riches,
recognition, victory – is well known to Aslan. Senior sons take upon
themselves the title and land of family; it is left to younger sons to venture
forth and carve new holdfasts from new worlds and that carving is the
stuff of adventure, the ai of new generations of heroes.

CONCLUSION

Many humans see in Aslan a likeness of a beast credited in your
mythology with great strength, wisdom and courage. Aslan see in
humans a resemblance to a beast, common in our legends as a
shrewd, clever trickster. Neither of us should be guided by myths. You
who would be huweihwoweiy to your Aslan comrades, understand what
drives them, understand their eaia, their personal heart of hearts, that
they seem not strange but huweihwoweiy-in human-terms; not human
but brothers.

ROYAL HUNT
Location : Corben (E545455-8) Gazulin Subsector, Trojan Reach
```

```
The Travellers are invited to take part in a ‘royal hunt’, which has become
more ceremonial occasion than an actual hunt in recent years. As the
procession wends its stately way through the countryside, it becomes
apparent that there is indeed a hunt taking place – and the royal party
are its prey.
```

```
CORBEN
Corben is a non-industrial world with a thin atmosphere containing a mild
biological taint tolerable to most humans without a mask, providing they
have built up an immunity or taken preventative medication. Corben is
famous for its exotic wildlife and the valuable mineral deposits discovered
in the Induial mountain region overlooking the main settlements in the
fertile plains surrounding the Dweljahra River. The world is ruled by a
group of hereditary nobles, each controlling an important technological
function. Their overall leader takes the title Potenate.
```

```
The Potentate of Corben is not quite a king. He does not rule outright but is
highly influential among the other nobles and no collective agreement can
be signed without his agreement. Thus the Potentate must be won over by
any offworld industry hoping to operate on Corben. Until now, the world’s
```

```
LIBRARY DATA
The following information is widely available through data terminals
and standard encyclopaediae. It can be considered to be reasonably
accurate as far as it goes but simple common sense should indicate that
the publicly available information is unlikely to be the whole story.
```

```
Yulyas: The yulya is a short-legged quadruped herbivore used on
several worlds as a beast of burden. It is slow and has a jerky gait,
making it unpopular as a riding animal where horses, kian or other more
comfortable creatures are available. However, yulyas are well suited to
thin atmosphere worlds and can be encountered almost anywhere. They
are generally docile but not very smart and as a result can be spooked by
things a brighter animal might recognize as harmless. A spooked yulya is
rather comical, especially if it starts bucking and jumping sideways, but
they are still heavy enough to be dangerous.

leaders have not been particularly receptive but it is apparent that if the
Potenate is in favour of a deal he will push it through despite opposition
from his near-peers among the nobility. This is thought to have caused
friction among the nobility but the Potentate’s position seems unassailable.

### 24

```
THE SITUATION
Corben’s substantial deposits of topoline and athast, both useful
in a number of industrial processes, have attracted the attention of
Langhausen Industries, LIC, a major mercantile concern. Elas Dulandir,
one of the principal partners at Langhausen, intends to negotiate an
agreement giving the company a virtual monopoly over mineral rights on
planet. The situation is time-critical at his end but he believes he has an
opportunity if he acts fast.
```

```
As a result, Dulandir has travelled light and fast to reach Corben, and
now needs to find capable individuals to assist him. The Travellers
are the best available, so Dulandir makes them an offer. This can be
varied by the Referee depending on the Travellers’ circumstance but will
start at Cr15000 per Traveller for what should be about two months of
routine work. He is looking for people who can act as bodyguards and
general assistants, and more importantly who can give the impression
that Dulandir is a powerful and capable individual by playing the role
of an expert retinue. Actual knowledge of law, commerce or security
operations is a bonus.
```

```
Dulandir explains that the Potentate of Corben, a powerful and wealthy
individual, is known to be something of a dilettante. He is, however,
honest, friendly and apparently well-disposed towards the Langhausen
offer. At present the Potentate is in the midst of plans for the annual royal
hunt, the highlight of court life on Corben and has invited Dulandir to
accompany him on the expedition.
```

```
The hunt is little more than a leisurely journey up the Dweljahra river
and into the foothills Langhausen is interested in mining. This will give
Dulandir plenty of time to explain the benefits of the investment for
Corben and persuade him whilst he is enjoying himself – while away
from the influence of other nobles.
```

```
THE PLOT
Unbeknownst to Dulandir or the Travellers, the Potentate has been
approached by representatives of a rival company, Nusku Trade, LIC.
Their offer was not as good as that made by Dulandir, at least as far as
the Potentate was concerned, and he turned it down. Undeterred, Nusku
made contact with the Potentate’s opponents and modified the deal to
benefit them far more.
```

```
This alone might not have been enough but the Potentate has offended
a number of his fellow nobles and some individuals within his household.
There is a small clique dedicated to removing him from power or passing
the title of Potentate on to someone they can influence more easily. Chief
among these is Hamir, a trusted royal advisor who has grown to hate the
```

### 25

Potentate. He has decided to eliminate him and the Langhausen party,
placing the Potentate’s idiot son on the throne as a puppet. He will then
be the power behind the throne of a world enriched by the Nusku deal.

Others are opposed to any offworld deals and have been led to believe
that removing or eliminating the Potentate will restore the status quo.
How they would react upon finding they have swapped one offworld
mining company for another is a matter for conjecture but they can
be dealt with when the time comes – indeed, they might be useful
scapegoats. Thus although Hamir is the leader of the conspiracy, its
members have varying motivations and levels of commitment. Those
who would balk at killing their ruler (or anyone else) have been given
supporting roles and assured that the plan is to arrange events that will
discredit the Potentate during the hunt. Those committed to the cause
have been assigned more direct roles.

Hamir has chosen the hunt as the perfect time to do away with his enemies.
A number of his men are among the retainers of the Potentate and more
are trailing the royal party as it sets out
into the jungles of the Dweljahra
Valley. Hamir hopes to allay
suspicion by having an
‘accident’ kill the Potenate,
and has arranged several
possibilities along the way.
If he is unable to eliminate
his enemy discreetly,
he is willing to order an
ambush and try to pin it on
subversives or enemies of
the Potentate... perhaps
offworlders who were
angered at not having
their one-sided deal
accepted.

```
Hamir
```

### 26

```
THE HUNT
The hunt is more a ceremonial camping trip than hunt, although
occasionally a party will split off to chase quarry. Progress is slow and
leisurely, with a camp set-up by the advance party in late afternoon
and often not struck until nearly noon. Evenings are spent feasting and
carousing around open fires, consuming far more than the royal party
can carry or hunt. A steady stream of yulya-drawn wagons plies back
and forth to the city, bringing up yet more delicacies, and from time-to-
time the Potentate will declare an extra-special feast, which is set-up in
advance by yet more wagon trains.
```

```
The whole hunting party tries to be as ‘traditional’ as possible, although
this is carried out in a rather inconsistent manner. Small refrigeration
units keep food fresh and wine chilled, and are carried in slings on
the flanks of pack-yulyas or in ‘traditional’ wagons made from spring
steel and lightweight plastics. Although everyone is sleeping on camp
beds in large circular tents, the tent poles are telescopic and act as
conduits for a heating and air conditioning system. In short, the hunt
is a pretence and nothing more... but it is a pretence that must be
taken very seriously. The Potentate (again, by tradition) must not see
anything ‘modern’ and studiously fails to notice that his wine is being
brought from an offworld chilling unit. This means that all hunting is
done with ‘traditional’ weapons.
```

```
It is not clear whether spears and bows were ever used for hunting
on Corben but they must be used during this hunt. The Potentates
bodyguards have modern handguns concealed under traditional garb
but anyone who tried to use a rifle would incur the grave displeasure of
the Potentate and all his court. This would certainly derail any attempt to
set-up an investment deal. Dulandir is well aware of this and informs the
Travellers ahead of time that they are not permitted to bring or use any
offworld tech or modern weaponry. He personally is quite happy for them
to do so, as long as they are extremely discreet, but his mission will be
compromised if the Travellers are caught using their comms or carrying
modern guns. He urges them to keep that in mind.
```

```
SETTING OFF
The hunt sets off with great ceremony, wending in a long line of
yulyas towards the distant foothills. The Potentate and his immediate
associates ride at the front, of course, and others are sometimes
honored by being invited up to ride with them for a time. Small parties
break off, apparently whenever the whim takes them, and chase game
with spears or dismount to shoot bows at the local wildlife. A few even
shoot from horseback but this is a difficult proposition given the gait of
a yulya (DM-2 for any attack rolls).
```

```
Within a few days the routine of the hunt becomes apparent. A leisurely
breakfast is followed by a few hours ride before camp is set-up and the
```

### 27

feasting begins. Anyone who wants to ride out and hunt something is
welcome to do so, although it appears very few kills are ever made.
The side parties are as much a social event as the main hunt and the
Travellers will find some groups far more welcoming than others.

The whole business is rather bizarre; a royal court very seriously
pretending to be low-tech barbarians whilst plodding slowly across the
countryside. It is enjoyable for all, and there is plenty of wine and good
food to be had. From time-to-time Dulandir is honored with an audience
and may take the Travellers with him. The Potentate also occasionally
turns aside from the hunt, taking only his closest advisors and guards
with him. The Travellers may deduce (but no-one will tell them, since that
would violate the spirit of the hunt) that he is leaving to spend some time
in the modern world, catching up on events and decisions that need to
be made using a mobile command post kept well away from the hunt.

THE FIRST INCIDENT

The first attempt on the Potentate’s life is perhaps the most subtle.
After a week or two of uneventful progress, everyone is used to the
routine. There have been occasional mild difficulties when terrain was
unexpectedly tricky or parts of the procession slowed and bunched up,
but for the most part everything has been quite genteel. The beginning of
the first incident seems little different.

The column approaches a steep-sided ravine with a small stream at
the bottom. Crossing it without falling off is a mildly tricky feat of what
might be called yulyamanship but not really very dangerous. Naturally,
the route is scouted by the advance party and the Potentate has no
reason to suspect any danger. This is an opportunity for him to show
off and he takes it.

Urging his mount into an ungainly gallop, the Potentate goes headlong at
the ravine. His entourage follow at a discreet distance, ensuring everyone
will be able to see his adept handling of the mount. He begins a rapid
descent of the ravine side, clearly intending to splash dramatically through
the stream and race up the far side. Then his mount shies at something,
leaping sideways and bolting along the stream bed. The Potentate has lost
his reins and is clinging to his saddle, unable to control his yulya.

The ravine runs parallel to the hunt’s course but is very steep as it
passes the rest of the hunting party. It might be possible to coax a yulya
into scrabbling down the side of the ravine to block the bolting animal at
this point but it would be dangerous. An alternative might be to scramble
down on foot and try to catch the Potentate’s fleeing yulya, although this
too is hazardous.

If the Travellers do nothing, other members of the hunt will make an
attempt to enact one or the other plan. They are not successful and the
Potentate’s yulya races out of sight around a curve in the ravine. He

eventually gets it under control and returns, wet and bruised, and more
importantly angry with his entourage for not helping. If the Travellers
are successful, they are honored for the next few days, riding with the
Potentate until he tires of their company.
```

```
It is eventually established that the Potentate’s mount shied at a branch
in the water, perhaps fearing it was a snake. This sort of thing happens
from time-to-time, although royal mounts are usually well trained. There
is no easy way to find out but in fact the yulya was fed a drug that made
it skittish. This practice is normally used for fixing races and reasonably
well known but there is no reason to suspect foul play so a search of the
camp is unlikely. The Travellers will not be permitted to carry one out
but can conduct their own discrete investigation. It leads back to a royal
groom in the pay of Hamir.
```

```
DELAJABAR IN THE CAMP!
The delajabar is a vicious predator native to Corben, not dissimilar to
a large puma. It is one of the more prestigious prey animals, not least
since it is capable of killing a human. Hunting a delajabar with a bow is a
dangerous business, although normally the predator will slink away from
humans and disappear into the undergrowth.
```

```
One evening, as festivities are winding down, a whining snarl is heard from
the direction of the Potentate’s tent. Locals know the sound and gesture
for everyone to freeze. Sure enough, a delajabar can be seen slinking
towards the Potentate, almost as if it had singled him out. Bodyguards
start to reach for their guns but someone urgently whispers something
about tradition. Some hesitate, others start trying to reach bows or knives.
The beast slinks closer to the Potentate, as if seeking him out personally.
```

```
Killing the delajabar with a gun should not be hard but it earns the
Potentate’s displeasure even if his life is saved. Killing it with a spear
or knife would be a deed celebrated for years to come and will again be
rewarded with an audience. The beast can also be driven off by noise
and confusion, especially accompanied by waving burning logs from the
fire. However, if it flees it will track the hunting party and may attack
someone or a yulya later in the trip.
```

```
Investigation yields a surprising find – the delajabar was in the Potentate’s
tent! It seems to have ripped a panel out of the rear and managed to get in
seeking food. Perhaps that is why it went after the Potentate rather than
anyone else – it had his scent. Attacking a camp of humans so boldly
is unusual behaviour for a delajabar but this one seems half-starved.
Exactly what it was doing in this area is a mystery although; nobody has
seen any trace of the creatures for days.
```

```
In fact this animal was trained for use in a deniable assassination attempt
and placed in the tent to ambush the Potentate. It got a bit too hungry
and broke out, going after him as it has been trained to do. There is no

way to prove any of this but the circumstances are a little suspicious.
The Potentate, however, is dismissive. There is no reason to suppose
anyone would have the means to set-up such an incident or a reason to.

THE ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT

After a few more days, the order reaches Hamir’s men in the hunting party
that they are to take direct action. A party splits off as usual to go hunting,
curving away out of sight as many others have done. A little while later
they re-appear, apparently racing after some game animal no-one else
has spotted. Their chase brings them close to the Potentate, something of
a breach of etiquette. However, he is good-natured about it, genially calling
out to the hunters to tell him what they are chasing and where it is.

### 30

```
One of the hunters attempts a bowshot from yulyaback, a tricky feat that
rarely succeeds. Sure enough the arrow goes off into the undergrowth.
Someone jeers and the shooter points vaguely where his arrow has
gone. This should get everyone’s attention and whilst they are distracted
a dismounted and concealed archer takes a shot at the Potentate. The
arrow will hit on a straight check of 8+, unless the Travellers spot the
archer and do something about it. In addition to its normal wound, the
arrow carries a powerful poison that will disorientate the victim and may
cause death due to respiratory complications. If nobody sees the archer
it is possible that the matter will be ascribed to a stray shot by an over-
excited hunter but anyone looking the right way can see it is a deliberate
attempt on the Potentate’s life.
```

```
If the archer fails, the fake hunting group will spur towards the Potentate
with spears and bows at the ready. They are not fanatics and can be
driven off if wounded, or clearly overmatched, but there is every chance
the Potentate will be stabbed or shot during this brief fight. Ideally, the
assassins would like to pin the deed on the Travellers but will settle for
killing their enemy and escaping.
```

```
OUT IN THE WILDERNESS
The Travellers are faced with a difficult situation. They are out in the
wilderness, possibly with a dead Potentate. At least some of the hunting
party are traitors and everyone seems to suspect everyone else (including
the Travellers) of wanting their leader dead.
```

```
The Travellers stand a real chance of being lynched or taken captive
to answer for the assassination attempt – whether as a result of
misunderstanding or a deliberate ploy on the part of Hamir’s men. They
may have to talk fast or take decisive action to save their skins and could
end up being prevented from offering life-saving medical treatment to the
Potentate by well-meaning guards.
```

```
Just to further complicate matters, Hamir has set-up a final attempt to
kill the Potentate on the homeward route. A party armed with modern
firearms – just hunting rifles and handguns but guns all the same – has
been scrambled from the city to escort the Potentate back home. If he
is still alive they will truthfully say Hamir sent them and will try to get the
Potentate and as few as possible of his people under their ‘protection’.
Once clear of the main hunt, they will kill everyone.
```

```
If that happens, the Travellers will be arrested by Hamir’s men and
evidence will be ‘found’ that they covertly brought along guns. The
assassination will be pinned on the Travellers and Hamir will become de
facto ruler of Corben. The best way to avoid being executed as regicides
is to get a grateful Potentate home – and this will greatly facilitate
Dulandir’s negotiations as well. The situation has the potential to work
out favourably for the Travellers... or very badly indeed.

### 31

Gravitic technology is one of the wonders of the universe. It propels
starships, lifts immense payloads out of gravity wells and provides
locomotion for air/rafts and other vehicles. Grav tech is also used in
ballistic weaponry, picking up where gauss weapons and mass drivers
leave off. Instead of the electromagnetic coils used in gauss weapons,
grav weapons (or ‘G guns’ as they are sometimes called) employ a ‘stack’
of circular grav plates that press a round forward and inward, keeping it
centred in the barrel as it accelerates to hypersonic speeds.

At TL14 and above, gravitic weapons use non-ferromagnetic
ammunition, creating an unparalleled delivery system. The rifle and
pistol magazines are actually ‘smart-matter banks’ that contain a dense
and malleable polymer that forms ammunition of various masses on the
fly. This allows the damage of the weapon to be minutely adjusted from
a minimum of one point to the maximum listed value of each weapon.
For example, a gravitic rifle can be set to deliver damage values of
one point, 1D+3, 2D+3, 3D+3 or the maximum 4D+3. The AP trait can
also be adjusted upward or downward by altering the shape and mass
distribution of each round.

Gravitic weapons are difficult to come by despite the advantages they
provide. They have never been widely adopted in the field due to their
much higher cost, maintenance requirements and high non-operational
weight. The stock, action and barrel of a grav weapon is made of denser,
heavier materials than other weapon systems and a battery is required
to charge the grav plates. When in use, the weight of the weapon is
compensated by gravitics, giving it a nominal weight and heft, but when
powered down and in storage, grav weapons are nearly twice their
operational weight.

The Imperial Army and Marines have historically engaged in a policy
of making the jump from gauss to high-energy weapons and have
rarely made large investments in gravitic weapons as a go-between.
Nevertheless, they remain a viable alternative that bridges the gap.

Gravitic Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW)

The gravitic SAW, first seen at TL13, is the first development in the
class. While more expensive than a comparable gauss weapon, it uses
higher calibre ammunition and can deliver a variety of payloads. Default
ammunition is a 10mm armor-piercing round but the weapon can
handle rounds of up to 14mm. The grav SAW is a bulky weapon typically
mounted on a bipod, tripod or vehicle mount. Battery life is 12 hours.

computer/1 and specialized Agent program that allows the use of vocal
and sub-vocal commands to adjust the weapon’s damage and AP trait.
Weapon adjustments require a minor action during combat. Battery life
is 24 hours.

TRAVELLINGTRAVELLING

```
TRAVELLER AND THE REFEREE
Traveller Referees are a curious phenomenon indeed. Possessed of
omnipotent and godlike powers over a universe of their own creation,
they are yet a victim of the Travellers who surround them, continually
threatened by varied responses (or lack thereof) to their actions and
rulings. This unstable situation can be an unsettling experience, for it
is upon the Referee’s success or failure that everyone’s enjoyment of
the game hinges... and they must walk a tightrope in order to avoid the
extremes of undue harshness or dull leniency. It is necessary to take the
Travellers in a direction that has already been mapped out but in such a
way as to make the game exciting, challenging and enjoyable. This is the
mark of a good Referee.
```

```
While the generation of a universe and the characters that inhabit it is
an important part of the Referee’s duties, the chores faced do not end
with the final pre-game dice-roll. They are only just beginning! As the
Travellers prepare themselves to venture forth, the Referee must begin
the delicate task of creating, balancing and conducting an adventure.
And before this happens, the Referee must keep several points in mind.
```

```
First, the adventure must be suitable. An ex-army colonel should not
be placed in a situation that requires the Pilot skill... and should not be
offered a spaceship as their reward... unless there are other Travellers in
the group with the skills required.
```

```
For this reason, if for no other, Travellers should be created before
the adventure is mapped out. This saves on the number of ludicrously
inappropriate adventures the Referee ends up running. The wants,
needs and desires of the Travellers should play some part in determining
the suitability of the adventure but those needs are not paramount and
should not all be filled at once... or the Travellers will have no reason
to adventure later on. As a matter of fact, it will often be necessary to
go against the Travellers when their objectives become incompatible
with running an exciting game. The Traveller who does not want to
get involved will have to be nudged – perhaps by being kidnapped or
marooned by accident. The Traveller who is too ambitious should meet
with all sorts of trouble, from accidents to government interference or any
other form of frustration that will keep them off the track of wanting to be
Galactic Overlord after the first week. Hopefully these methods will steer
the Traveller back to the path the Referee first sent them down.
```

### 35

Another consideration is the reward. As mentioned before, it should be
appropriate, or the Traveller will be foolish to accept it. The prospect (which
may not all be fulfilled) of a gain large enough to interest the Traveller
must exist, unless the Traveller has been established as the sort of person
who wants to go out and adventure just for the fun of it. However the
Traveller with millions of Credits is not likely to risk life and limb for a paltry
hundred thousand or so without good cause. If the reward the Referee
has in mind does not interest a Traveller (and the Referee does not want
to raise it) then build in other motivations. The Traveller should find his
starship impounded or a price on their head... anything that might threaten
them but which the adventure will change or correct. Motivation is truly an
important part of the Referee’s job; it keeps the game moving even when
Travellers hesitate about being involved in some particular action.

Most important of all, however, is the need to balance complexity in the
adventure. This is more difficult in Traveller than fantasy roleplaying
games, as they arbitrarily provide levels of skill and levels of enemies
that are challenging at each degree of difficulty while not presenting
impossibilities. In Traveller, the Referee must do their own balancing but
a little common sense can usually supply most of what is needed.

The Travellers can almost always supply many of the clues. If the Referee
knows that they will need to have the Electronics (computer) skill to solve
the problem presented, then the Referee should make sure one of the
Travellers has the skill. If none do, they should have the chance to find
out what they need to know before they are actually confronted with the
problem, giving them time to hire someone with the skill, perhaps.

Rumors are the key way of balancing in this fashion. While many will be
red herrings designed to trap or confuse the Travellers, they should be
set-up so that astute Travellers will know what to prepare for. Rumors
can channel the course of play into an area the Referee desires; they can
discourage Travellers who want to try something the Referee is not ready
for and they are ideal clues that should lead Travellers to the solutions
to their problems.

Other ways of balancing play can come through Non-Player Characters,
through which the Referee can inject knowledge or skills not available to
the Travellers. The descriptive powers of the Referee can also be used
to balance a situation, by giving verbal clues to what lies ahead based on
observations by the Travellers.

### 36

```
If all else fails, however, the Referee has one last recourse. Direct and
godlike intervention, in the form of good or bad fortune, can ensure the
complexity of the scenario will always challenge the Travellers. The
Traveller who has proven totally unprepared can get lucky and escape
from almost certain disaster; the Travellers who go out loaded down with
enough gear to take on the Imperial Death Star might find a streak of ill
fortune disrupting ‘the best laid plans of mice and men’.
```

```
As an example, suppose a party of Travellers has armed themselves
with every imaginable weapon, plus grav belts and combat armor. Their
opponents are numerous but uncivilised, barbarians. There is no danger
to the Travellers, who can fly out of reach and slaughter natives left and
right. This kind of situation might satisfy a few closet psychopaths but it
will not be much of a fun or balanced game.
```

```
Yet the Referee can reach forth and behold! Ill fortune strikes! A poorly
maintained grav belt fails and its owner drops gently (or not so gently)
to ground, into the midst of a group of very frustrated and rude natives.
Now a contest that was essentially target practice takes on a new and
vivid interest for all concerned, especially the Traveller who suffered
the misfortune! There are other considerations the Travellers must take
into account, now, as they continue play. Do they rescue the victim?
Negotiate? Hope they escape? Go on their way? Little incidents like this
can be used to make the adventure flow smoothly, with everyone finding
a challenge facing them no matter how good, how well-equipped or how
careful they have been.
```

```
This power of the Referee can be used as much or as little as necessary.
Often the Referee can stall the Travellers from voyaging toward a
point not yet prepared with exactly this kind of judicious intervention.
Accidents, rumors, other missions, all can take place along the route
the Travellers are following. These delays give the Referee time to get
their act together and prepare for the big one... whatever that may be.
But be careful! The Travellers should be allowed to do some of the things
they desire or they will lose interest.
```

```
Of course there is a final remedy for the recalcitrant Traveller who will not
see eye-to-eye with what the Referee has decreed. Since the Referee is,
after all, playing a role as well (a particularly powerful character... God)
they have certain options, which are presented below for use as needed.
```

```
•  A giant hand can reach out and grab their starship.
•  An asteroid can plunge into the ship, killing all aboard.
•  They can fall into a black hole.
•  Or, for the traditionalist among you, try hitting ‘em with a lighting
bolt! Just so long as you have a good time.
```

### 37

SENSOR OPERATIONS
Travellers can decide what sort of sensor package their vessel will carry,
so what DMs it grants on checks to detect and analyse contacts. One
perfectly viable approach to shipboard sensor operations is to say the
sensors can detect whatever the plot needs them to and the DM they
grant indicates how well they do that. This is not very realistic, however.
This article presents an approach to sensor operations in Traveller that
is more grounded in science.

All sensors fall into one of two types; active and passive, and each can
only detect certain things. This has a number of implications when one
vessel has greatly superior sensor equipment to another.

Passive Sensors are receivers only. The Mk I Eyeball is an example of a
passive sensor. It receives light and forms images of what is illuminated
but cannot emit light of its own. The main advantage of passive sensors
is that they do not give away the user’s presence and generally require
little power.

Active Sensors send out a signal of some kind and detect what bounces
back. A person in a dark room with a flashlight is using the same detection
equipment – eyeballs – as someone hiding in the corner but their light
source will be obvious even if it is not illuminating a target.

For civilian ships operating in a safe environment there is no reason
not to run with sensors active at all times, however a ship that wants to
hide must reduce its emissions or eliminate them entirely. A ship actively
searching with sensors will reveal its presence to one using passive
sensors from further away than active detection can be accomplished but
sometimes this is necessary. On other occasions, warships may sneak
about a system using only passive sensors, hoping to avoid detection
long enough to gain an advantageous firing position.

### 38

```
Whenever a vessel uses an active sensor package it will automatically
be detected by every vessel running sensors of the same kind. For
example, a ship that turns on its radar will be detected by all other ships
in range that have radar receivers. A vessel that does not have radar
(which would be unusual, to say the least) will not detect active radar.
This can be important when a high-tech ship has a sensor type not
present on a lesser one. Clever crews might use an active sensor not
likely to be detected.
```

```
In the Third Imperium universe there is no device that can transmit
information faster than light. Sensor equipment thus uses speed-of-light
emissions and detects them, meaning that a very distant contact will
have moved by the time sensor data arrives. If a ship 22 light-seconds
away is being tracked with radar, what is actually being plotted is its
position 22 seconds in the past. Tactical plots usually include a prediction
of likely current locations based on the contact’s known performance
parameters. Of course, a vessel may change course or speed during
this time so the prediction becomes more vague as distance increases.
```

```
SENSOR PACKAGES
All starship sensor packages contain passive optical and thermal sensors.
These are cameras mounted on the vessel, which create separate or
composite images based on visible light and infrared radiation. A passive
optical/thermal sensor package can detect objects that emit heat (such
as stars and starships) with relative ease but colder, darker objects are
much more difficult to spot. In the inner system, where there is thermal
and visible-spectrum radiation from the star(s), objects may be warmed
or illuminated. Further out the only way to spot moons or planetoids –
even planets – is when they pass in front of another light source such as
a distant star.
```

```
The sensor package fitted to a ship dictates what it can and cannot
detect, and also some additional capabilities.
```

```
The capabilities of sensor suites increase with complexity and Tech
Level. The radar fitted as part of a basic sensor package is a simple

### 39

navigational set with poor resolution and little ability to determine details
of a target. On the other hand, a military radar set can provide much
better resolution, aiding identification and tracking of contacts.

All sensor packages have a base range within which they are fully
effective. DM-1 applies to all Electronics (sensors) checks for every
range band outside the system’s base range.

Radar indicates the vessel has the capability to emit and detect radio-
frequency pulses. This includes communications transmissions – ships
can be detected from radio chatter even if it cannot be decrypted. Radar
can be used to detect vessels and obstructions, and provides basic
information on a contact such as general size and shape.

Lidar is a laser-based system that is not powerful enough to damage
a target. Lidar provides extremely accurate rangefinding and precise
scans of objects at short distances.

Densitometers are gravity-based sensors that provide a detailed map
of mass and space within an object. A densitometer can ‘see inside’ a
ship in a way that radar cannot, although it can only map solid objects by
shape and density. This generally gives a fairly clear picture of what is
inside a vessel or planetoid, but can be misleading.

Neural Activity Sensors are passive. They have no active emissions
but detect the presence and general nature of brain activity. This gives an
indication of the number of crew or passengers and any animals present,
and is the only way to ‘scan for life signs’ in the Third Imperium universe.

Jammers are devices intended to blind enemy sensors by producing
powerful emissions in the same spectrum. A vessel with jammers can
conduct electronic warfare operations against any sensor type it carries.
For example, a military sensor pack can jam radar and lidar but has no
effect against a densitometer scan.

EMCON is short for Emissions Control. A ship using EMCON has a
reduced signature and is harder to detect, although also uses its own

active sensors in short pulses or at lower power settings. EMCON, when
active, imposes DM-1 to attempts to detect the ship and DM-2 on its
own checks using active sensors. Extreme EMCON imposes DM-2 on
attempts to detect the ship and DM-3 on its own active sensors.
```

```
LPI, or Low-Probability-of-Intercept is a modification to sensors that
enables them to operate normally or at a lower-powered setting less likely
to give the vessel’s position away. LPI sensors cost twice as much as the
standard version and impose DM-1 on attempts to detect a vessel by its
sensor emissions. A vessel with multiple sensor types can choose not to
use advanced systems that LIP (or ELPI) is not available for, gaining the
benefit of reduced detectability at the cost of only having data from radar
and standard thermal/optical systems.
```

```
ELPI, or Extremely Low-Probability-of-Intercept is a modification
available two Tech Levels higher than the sensor’s introductory Tech
Level. ELPI sensors impose DM-3 to detect the ship by its emissions. A
vessel that has ELPI (or LPI) sensors must pay the full cost even if the
(E)LPI capability is not available for some of its advanced sensors.

### USING SENSORS

The sensor suite aboard a ship combines data from all sources to build
a picture of its surroundings. When a vessel is scanned, the sensor
suite maps its size and shape, internal structure if a densitometer is
available, water and air leakage, thermal outlines and electromagnetic
effects from circuitry. The more data is available, the clearer the picture.
This means that sometimes a ship might be misidentified at first. A
sensor contact may be presented to the crew as a vague 200-ton blip,
then a rough shape identified at a low level of confidence as a 200-ton
free trader. Some time later it is re-identified as a far trader, this time
with a high level of confidence.

It is not possible to ‘scan for life signs’ in the manner of many TV shows
without a neural activity sensor. However, a ship that has power and heat
inside is a strong indication that it may have a live crew. One that is venting
air and water with fragments of debris is clearly in trouble and one that is
cold and unpowered is probably dead or lying doggo. The Referee can
use this inability to get 100% effective information to great dramatic effect;
Travellers cannot be sure a ship is uncrewed and dead. They can assist
their search of the wreck for survivors by looking for warm areas or air
leaks but cannot be sure exactly what lies beyond that bulkhead.

###### Stage 1: Detection

The first stage is to detect a contact, which will initially be nothing more
than a blip on the display. To detect an object requires an Average (8+)
Sensors check, with DMs applying:

Sensors in Passive mode only (detecting ship): -

Target Ship

```
EMCON in operation: -
Extreme EMCON in operation: -
Per range band beyond Base Range: -
Vessel is charging a jump drive: +2 x Jump score
Vessel is manoeuvring under power: +1 per Thrust applied
Vessel is using jammers: +
```

Scanning Ship

```
EMCON in operation: -
Extreme EMCON in operation: -
```

A vessel using active sensors will automatically be detected at one
range band less than the detecting vessel’s Base Range and one using
jammers will be automatically detected at Base Range; a Civilian sensor

42

```
package (Base Range Medium) will automatically detect a craft using
active sensors at Short range and one using jammers at Medium range.
```

###### Stage 2: Track and Scan

```
Once an object is detected, it will be tracked until contact is lost. This can
happen if sensor operations are disrupted or the contact passes behind
some obstruction. A vessel that enters EMCON or otherwise reduces its
signature and changes course, even slightly, requires a new Electronics
(sensors) check to maintain contact.
```

```
Scanning a contact means trying to establish exactly what it is, its
capabilities and condition. This requires an Average (8+) Electronics
(sensors) check, with DM-4 if the ‘scan’ attempt is being made with
passive sensors only. Scanning can only be performed within the sensor
suite’s Base Range.
```

```
An additional DM-4 applies if the target is jamming the scan attempt.
```

```
A new scan can be made every 1D rounds, adding the total Effect
gained until the scanning crew are satisfied with the information they
have obtained.
```

```
The Effect of this check indicates what level of information is available,
as shown on the Scanning table.
```

###### Scanning

```
Total Effect Information
0- The contact remains a vague blip
1-2 Rough shape and estimate of tonnage
3-4 Outline and tonnage, good level of confidence
5-6 Ship side, class and probable identity
7+ Specific data, such as damage status and vessel’s exact
identity
```

#### Additional Sensor Tasks

```
It is often possible to determine a vessel’s intentions by its emissions. The
Contact Actions table shows what will be detected with an appropriate
Electronics (sensors) check. If the check is failed, the scanning ship has
no indication that anything is about to happen. An Effect of 0-2 gives
a vague warning such as ‘increased power to maneuver drive’ whilst
an Effect of 3+ will give the scanning vessel a very clear indication of
the target ship’s intentions. The level of the Electronics (sensors) check
varies depending on how obvious the action is – which usually comes
down to how much power it requires.

DM-4 applies if the target is actively jamming sensors.
DM-2 applies if the scanning vessel is using passive sensors only.

An Effect of 3+ will provide more information, such as which weapons
are being locked on or what sort of maneuver the contact vessel is
about to make.

### SENSOR SCREEN DISPENSER

The sensor screen dispenser resembles a standard sandcaster canister
and is designed to be fired from any sandcaster without modification.
When launched the canister spins, flinging out submunitions that burst
within seconds to create a large cloud of self-igniting radar-reflective
material. This is effectively a smokescreen in space; one that is opaque
to radar and optical sensors, and enough to blind thermal detectors. One
canister is sufficient to conceal 100 tons of vessel; multiple canisters can
be used to cover larger ships.

A sensor screen will cause radar, lidar and optical/thermal sensors to lose
their lock on the launching vessel. The screen dissipates in D3 rounds,
at which time the contact can be re-acquired – if the ship expends any
Thrust it can also be re-acquired as it moves away from the screen.

Screen dispensers are most commonly used to break a sensor lock
and allow a vessel to engage EMCON before trying to slip away. The
screen is not effective against missiles already at attack range but can
prevent an enemy ship from providing affective targeting information
to its missile salvo.

Each dispenser canister costs Cr10000 and takes up the same space as
a standard sandcaster canister.

## THE HLANSSAI

```
The Hlanssai are a humanoid minor race originating in the Vargr Extents.
Today they can be encountered throughout much of the Imperium,
although they are uncommon far to rimward of the Imperial core. The
Hlanssai are widely admired for their artistic talents, grace and dexterity,
but many members of other races distrust the Hlanssai because of their
```

- justified – reputation for emotional instability.

```
Hlanssai are tall, averaging just over two metres but very light and slender
of build, rarely massing more than 55-60kg. The race is homeothermic,
bisexual and viviparous, producing one or two young after an eight-month
gestation period. Hlanssai bodies are half covered with a silky, glossy
yellow fur and they seldom bother with clothing. Their most striking visual
feature is the head, with its two large eyes and two even larger ears.
The former are sensitive to a range of frequencies extending into the
ultraviolet; the external flaps of the latter serve to detect thermal radiation
and air currents with considerable efficiency, as well as focussing sound
into a highly efficient inner ear. The race’s hands have three three-jointed
fingers and a stubby, unjointed ‘thumb’ each; their feet are similar and
can provide grip, especially when climbing.
```

## HISTORY

```
The Hlanssai evolved on Vrirhlanz, in the Vargr Extents (B657721-7), a
planet not wholly unlike Terra. Their ancestors were intermittent/gatherer
types, adapted for a semi-nocturnal existence in moderately forested
areas. This species already possessed a fair level of intelligence when
tectonic shifts created a land bridge between two continents, allowing a
large number of different, and frequently dangerous, species to invade
the proto-Hlanssai’s home environment.
```

```
The resulting evolutionary pressure encouraged flexible, intelligent
behaviour but this was only part of the result. New dangers confronting
the Hlanssai demanded the ability to perceive situations quickly and in
detail, and an awareness of all possible subtleties. The race already
possessed the acute senses of the sometime night-dweller; evolution
now enhanced these to exceptional levels. Hlanssai intelligence was
the product of the need to analyse and comprehend sensory inputs;
Hlanssai psychology is therefore oriented overwhelmingly towards
immediate sensory awareness and possible responses. Likewise, the
species’ philosophies are sensualistic, frequently dismissive of the long
term and notoriously sybaritic and hedonistic.

```

```
A Hlanssai will usually respond to a situation as it occurs with little
regard for long-term consequences, which often means their reactions
are dramatic or even excessive. This is not to say that Hlanssai are
psychopathic or vicious; they are capable of personal loyalty and
affection and their capacity for empathy is quite phenomenal, however
enduring trust is alien to them.
```

### SOCIETY

```
Hlanssai culture had achieved a kind of static equilibrium when the race
was first contacted by the Vargr and has changed only slightly since.
Hlanssai psychology dictates that complex, rigid social systems and long-
range planning are impossible and even familial or tribal bonds are weak.
Balancing this, the species’ tendency towards cooperation in the face of
immediate danger is powerful. The result is a system of administration
```

##### Vrirhlanz

##### Gadoeth subsector

46

```
by self-interested cliques and participant democracy, which appears
anarchic to most outsiders but is entirely acceptable to most Hlanssai.
A Hlanssai who finds the current situation unacceptable usually either
forms their own clique or takes to demagogic politics.
```

```
Personal violence and theft are quite common but represent a sufficient
immediate personal danger to trigger the cooperation instinct. Larger
scale organization for long-term aims is rare, only occurring when
unusually capable and charismatic Hlanssai perceive a particularly
strong racial need and persuade others to work together to meet it.
```

```
Normally, the Vargr have poor relations with minor races within their
territory but the Hlanssai are an exception. The species’ immense
versatility, subtlety and talent for empathy enables them to persuade
others of their usefulness, and Hlanssai social scientists, servants,
traders and spies have travelled virtually everywhere that the Vargr have
gone – in some cases beyond.
```

```
The Vargr generally regard the Hlanssai as useful, dangerous and
fortunately weak; the Hlanssai regard the Vargr as graceless and
unsubtle, yet interesting and useful. Beyond the Vargr Extents, Hlanssai
are widely seen as enigmatic, unstable, intelligent and interesting;
Hlanssai attitudes toward other races vary but generally involve
curiosity mixed with ironic humor.
```

```
A final important concept to note when dealing with Hlanssai is that
of N’tarronth and its converse, N’tarronchii’a; a further consequence
of Hlanssai sensualism. N’tarronth is usually translated as ‘shaping’
or ‘manufacturing’ but it can best be expressed in human terms as
‘imposing arbitrary form upon the universe’. Hlanssai are acutely aware
of the distinction between the natural and artificial, and regard one of the
most important aspects of individual behaviour to be the extent to which
a being accepts external reality and acts within existing limitations. A
being who rejects things-as-they-are and seeks to shape reality to their
will is or displays N’tarronth; a being who takes a passive, accepting view
is N’tarronchii’a.
```

```
Despite the fact that other races view them as mercurial and unstable,
Hlanssai tend – by their own standards at least – to be highly consistent in
being either N’tarronchii’a or N’tarronth. They regard an inability to choose
between the two modes of behaviour as decidedly odd, comparable with a
refusal to eat or drink. This does not imply any question of good or evil in
Hlanssai terms; it is simply a matter of normal sentient behaviour.
```

```
In general, music, applied science, law, manufacturing industry and
exploration are classed as N’tarronth, whereas mathematics, figurative
art and hedonism are N’tarronchii’a. To the Hlanssai, therefore, most
other races tend towards N’tarronth but display an odd tendency to mix
elements of N’tarronchii’a. In other words, Hlanssai understand other
species as little as other species understand Hlanssai.
```

```
47
```

### HLANSSAI

### TRAVELLERS

Hlanssai may be encountered throughout
Charted Space, particularly in spinward
and coreward regions, and in a wide
variety of circumstances. Many are afflicted
with wanderlust, becoming roving artists,
entertainers, animal-handlers or adventurers.
A strong disinclination to settle anywhere for
long – and an inability to remain on good
terms with one employer for extended
periods – keeps them on the move.

Some Hlanssai become ‘liaison
specialists’ in the employ of merchant
starships engaged in exploratory
work, in which their immense
capacity for empathy is extremely
useful but Hlanssai cannot accept
discipline, so rarely find work in large,
formal organizations. They are almost
never found in military service.

#### Characteristics

Hlanssai Travellers have the following
modifiers applied to their characteristics:
STR -2, DEX +2, EDU -

SOC is always treated as 5 in alien societies
but position in Hlanssai society is determined
on 1D+4.

#### Traits

Hlanssai Travellers all possess one of the
following traits:

N’tarronth: This Hlanssai is the sort to impose
their will upon the universe and likely has a
technical inclination. They gain DM+2 on all
checks rolled to make things happen, such as
persuading someone to do something or building
a device to carry out a necessary function.

N’tarronchii’a: This Hlanssai goes with the flow
of the universe and has an inclination towards
arts and sciences that explain mysteries of the
cosmos. The Hlanssai gains DM+2 on all checks

48

```
dealing with comprehension, such as understanding someone else’s
motivations or expressing the gravitational forces around a star in
mathematical form.
```

#### Careers

```
Hlanssai outside their traditional social environment can enter any career
but suffer DM-6 to enlist or advance in military careers. DM-3 is applied
to enlist and advance in careers within major corporations (such as
merchant marine or corporate agent).
```

```
Hlanssai raised in their home society do not follow the standard
career system but instead choose whether they are N’tarronth or
N’tarronchii’a. The Traveller then begins a series of one to six terms
of service. N’tarronth Hlanssai can choose how many terms to serve
but N’tarronchii’a roll 1D for the number of terms served. There are
no re-enlistment, commission, promotion or survival checks, but each
term the Hlanssai gain a skill and roll to see if they gain an extra skill
on top of this. N’tarronth Hlanssai gain an extra skill on a straight check
of 10+. N’tarronchii’a Hlanssai gain an extra skill on 8+.

## SIDURI STATION

The gas giant Enkidu (roughly Saturn-sized) presents a tantalising
opportunity for cloud-mining (or skim-mining) operations. The upper
atmosphere not only provides the typical bounty of deuterium but
also possesses several complex compounds. These rare gaseous
compounds are formed only through the natural processes found on gas
giants and are used in a variety of high-tech industrial processes. Enkidu
is unique in that conditions deep inside the giant have caused a plume
of these complex compounds to rise to the surface, making them much
more economical to obtain.

One of the main difficulties for cloud miners is the lack of a life-bearing
world from which to sally forth in their search for the ‘big score’. For
several decades, a small orbital station was used as a starport, a Class
D affair that rapidly showed wear as traffic into, and out of, Enkidu
increased.

One of the moons of Enkidu, Shamhat, possesses moderately large
deposits of light metals and the isotope helium-3 (traded as a radioactive).
This has promoted a cottage mining industry on the Size 3 moon. While
not unusually rich by the standards of the great cartels and multi-

50

```
sector spanning corporations, the resources of Shamhat have drawn a
considerable population of wildcat prospectors.
```

```
Simply put, Shamhat is wealthy enough to provide a good living for a small
prospecting business or independent wildcatter, yet too sparse to bring in
the heavier players of the mining trade. Some of the wildcatters refer to this
as the ‘Goldilocks Effect,’ perfect for independents such as themselves.
```

### HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT

```
As the Enkidu Highport began to fall apart, the miners of Shamhat
banded together to create a new Class C station on their beloved moon,
spearheaded by wildcat miner Harlan Jorace who had struck it rich by
discovering a huge vein of helium-3 rich regolith. Jorace, along with
several other miners as part of the Siduri Consortium, then proceeded to
construct the base in several phases. The starport is currently at Phase
II (and still Class C).
```

### STATION FACILITIES

```
Siduri Station is comprised of three main sections; the Garden Centre
and two rings (Inner and Outer) as well as several hangars and landing
pads in the outlying area for small craft (the landing pads) and smaller
spacecraft (the larger hangers). Beyond the Outer Ring are several
isolated structures, consisting of several hotels and two terminals. The
entire base (with exception of open docking facilities) is vacuum sealed
and the air is replenished by hydroponics. The station is also outfitted
with internal, external and drone cameras. The locks are all equipped
with biometric scanners. The outer perimeter (XT-line) of Siduri Station
is very basic, consisting largely of lighting and light-strips to let the locals
know where the boundary is located.
```

### GARDEN CENTRE

```
Garden Centre is the nerve centre of the base and at six levels tall, is the
highest elevation. It consists of the headquarters, a small ‘sleep coffin’
area for on-call HQ personnel, various support-related facilities (kitchens,
trauma centre, EVA Bay) and some cargo space. The single ‘big gun’ of
the station, a large particle beam bay, is located here, along with five
double laser turrets. Beneath the Garden Centre is the hydroponic dome.
```

```
The single linkway leading from the Garden Centre enters at the dome
and passes through a secure checkpoint.
```

### INNER RING

```
The Inner Ring is two levels tall (although there are some three level
tall areas) and is dedicated to station support. This includes most of the
station personnel housing (350 apartments: 100 basic, 200 standard
```

```
51
```

and 50 luxury) the security section, the personnel recreation area, a
larger set of kitchens and mess area, station personnel-only medical
facility and barracks facility for the hired security personnel (Balistika
Sekureco). The Inner Ring has two vehicle bays, one for the trikes and
monowheels used inside of the station and a second EVA vehicle bay
used for forays outside of the station. There is also a cargo area for life
support and other supplies.

The Inner Ring is connected to the Outer Ring by way of three dual
linkways, each with a secure checkpoint.

### OUTER RING

The Outer Ring is two (and occasionally three) levels tall and contains
more of the commercial elements of the station as well as the main
defensive capabilities (40 retractable weapon emplacements). The
commercial elements include main warehouses (both standard and
hazmat) with loading equipment, the station’s many mobile repair rigs,
two medium-sized bars (the Debris Field and Blast Chamber) as well
as several takeout restaurants and a wide variety of shops and offices
occupied by small entrepreneurs. A medical facility provides care for
both personnel and visitors. There are six security checkpoints scattered
through the Outer Ring, which do not prevent movement but can drop
blast doors over main access points and subsidiary sections.

### SMALLCRAFT DOCKING

Outside of the Outer Ring are several isolated structures, including
docking facilities for small craft and small spacecraft, five hotels and
two terminals. These are connected to the Outer Ring by either single
or dual linkways (depending on the size of vessel they support). These
junctures are monitored remotely but have no checkpoints. They may,
however, be isolated by blast doors from the rest of the facility in case
of a seal failure (or when customs has to check through visitors coming
from outside of the system). The docking facilities leading directly off
the Outer Ring are generally used for local traffic and small craft. The
facilities here are found in three categories: the 100-dton landing pads
are generally used for small craft, while the 200-dton and 400-dton
enclosed hangars are used for either small craft or small spacecraft as
needed. Each pad or hangar has a refuelling station, station hook-ups
for life support and power, and their own basic rig set-up for loading/
offloading goods (robotic cargo handlers or industrial loaders can be
dispatched by the station headquarters).

### BRANDENBURG HOTEL

The Brandenburg Hotel is a luxury class hotel, named for one of the
members of the Consortium (who substantially funded the hotel’s
construction and demanded the right to name it after herself). It
holds 80 guest rooms (five of which are large suites) and amenities

eat, with a ‘rustic’ motif (weapons/shields on walls). Apparently, someone
thought Gilgamesh was a Viking, however, as most of the motif is far
more Norse than Babylonian. The Enkidu Tearoom (bar) is surprisingly
upscale for the Gilgamesh Arms. The wainscoting here is made from real
teak imported from three parsecs away. Among the several small shops
is Max’s Munitions, which performs gun repairs and modifications for
reasonable prices, owned/operated by a retired Marine Staff Sergeant
(Maxine LeDoun).
```

### OTHER HOTELS

```
The other two standard hotels, the Redspot Inn and the Ice Pagoda differ
only in minor ways from the Gilgamesh Arms. The Redspot has no casino
but a better restaurant (known for desserts). The Pagoda, which is three
levels tall but has a much smaller footprint than the other hotels, has a
tiny bar attached to their restaurant and a few more shops than usual.
```

```
The Prospector’s Palace is a two-level economy hotel, which provides
service to Travellers who have reached the system with very little in
their pockets. As befitting the name, the Palace provides occasional
service to the local wildcat miners of Shamhat who have grown tired of
their tiny sealed habitats and want to be sociable for a while without the
costs associated with long-term housing in one of the Terminals. It has
space for 300 (although 100 of these are in four communal dormitories
and many rooms are listed as dual occupancy) and minimal amenities
```

```
55
```

(cafeteria, several takeout food joints, undersized trauma centre for
total capacity) as well as accommodations for the hotel staff (32 total:
12 standard and 20 basic).

Alice’s, a takeout restaurant with a surprisingly good breakfast bar,
opens promptly at 0600 hours. The Golden House is the largest bar on-
station and certainly the least attractive; this is the place to go for harder-
to-get information, not only about Siduri Station and Shemhat, but the
rigs around Enkidu as many of the rig personnel spend their off-time
here. The Prospector’s Palace only contains one (rather large) shop,
the Forty-Niner, rented out by Hervé Schalt, who specialises in providing
gear to the local miners. A good deal of this equipment is used (gently
and otherwise), some of it is stolen (fell off a transport) and some of it
has been specially ordered but all of it is solid and Hervé has been able
to attain and sustain a good reputation among the wildcatters (for quality,
not his prices or general manner).

### THE TERMINALS

Alpha Terminal and Beta Terminal connect the main hangars and landing
pads to the station and are identical to one another, so the following
description applies to each. The terminal includes non-station personnel
long term housing (180 standard, 200 basic apartments), customs and
a commercial and recreation area for visitors. The commercial and
recreation area contains a medium-sized casino, a few offices (mainly
staffed by the representatives of larger companies), a handful of medium-
sized shops and takeout restaurants that provide quick tasty meals to the
passengers coming off of incoming vessels. Each terminal also has three
bars, two medium and one large-sized. While this arrangement is not the
most efficient, the Consortium understands the dictate that passengers,
when departing from a ship on which they have been for a week or more,
want to spread out a little and socialise with a different crowd.

The customs area is staffed by system government personnel (by law)
and is situated at the end of a series of short concourses that feed goods
and passengers directly past on their way to the interior of the station.
Customs includes a small amount of warehousing (either for held goods
or commercial traffic as needed).

Several Bars are present; Alpha Terminal sports the Naïveté, the Foggy
Bottom and the Tiki Roadhouse. Beta Terminal hosts the Armadillo Pub,
the Vortex Café and Dr. Diablo’s, which serves ‘Dr. Diablo’s Miracle
Cure,’ guaranteed to de-rust lug nuts or get someone appallingly drunk.

The terminals also feature a single security checkpoint outside of the
dual linkway that leads into the Outer Ring. This checkpoint does not
stop any passengers (they have already cleared customs) but provides
a visible presence for security and when needed, can cut this section off
from the Outer Ring.

### MAIN DOCKING AREA

```
Attached to each terminal are a dozen 1,000-dton enclosed hangars
(thus, 24 in total in Phase II), which are linked by concourses to the
terminals. There is a spur between them leading to the unenclosed
landing pad area. This area includes six 5,000-dton engineered landing
pads and a dozen smallcraft (100-dton) landing pads. The concourses
leading to and from these areas include flex-seal attachments that can
be used for ship airlocks or on most ship bay doors. The smallcraft pads
and 1,000-dton hangars have single refuelling stations (which can pump
in one dton of fuel a minute) and basic loading rigs, while the 5,000-dton
pads have two refuelling stations, (allowing a 5,000-dton jump-4 ship to
be refuelled in a ‘mere’ 16 hours and 40 minutes) and industrial loaders.
```

### THE CONSORTIUM BOARD

```
The Siduri Consortium owns Siduri Station collectively, operating as
a kind of umbrella corporation, not only over the station but several of
the subsidiary businesses attached to it. Anyone holding more than
5% of the shares in the Consortium are allowed to take a seat on the
board. There are six members at present and decisions made by the
Consortium Board are handled directly through voting shares. If none of
the Board gets a majority vote (50% of the shares plus one), the matter is
turned over to the Stockholders (which would include the 3% out-system
shareholders) in a general vote.
```

#### Harlan Jorace

```
Harlan Jorace is the wildcat prospector who bankrolled a substantial
portion of Phase I based on his helium-3 strike some 20 years ago. As
such, Jorace is the plurality stockholder of the Siduri Consortium (28%
currently). While he stays on the station for some part of the time, Jorace
continues to prospect on Shemhat and has an extensive sealed habitat
of his own on the other side of the planet called ‘Shadewell’ by the locals.
```

```
Jorace has a bombastic personality and greatly admires the freedom that
he has acquired through his ownership of the station. He is known as a
slave-driver for those who work with him but also rewards them well and
is fiercely loyal to them in return. This is a product of his own work-ethic,
he regularly logs in double shifts on his own enterprises and expects the
same of those under him. If it was not for the fact that he pays half-again
what others pay, very few would work for him. Several wildcatters on
Shemhat started out as employees of Jorace and some of them began
with a stake that he provided (at least in part) for them. He is the kind of
man some hate and some love, and rarely does anyone fall in between.
```

#### Virette Brandenburg

```
Virette Brandenburg is another wildcat prospector, who holds the
second-greatest stake in the Siduri Consortium (22% currently). Her
money was used on the base itself but some was devoted to building
```

```
59
```

the Brandenburg Hotel, which she demanded the right to name (after
herself) and runs as her own little fiefdom. She spends practically all
of her time on the station, in a luxury double-suite of her own design in
the hotel. Her parties, all held at the eponymous bar/nightclub Virette’s,
are ongoing affairs.

Virette Brandenburg has the dubious honor of having another of the
moons of Enkidu named after her, Virette’s Moon, which whilst initially
taken for a rogue asteroid of good size, has since been listed as an
irregular moon. It was named for her, because like it, she is ‘highly
eccentric, yet lifeless and hard as hell’ according to the discoverer (a
former lover). She has sole mining rights over the iron-rich asteroid and
used those profits to buy herself into the Consortium.

Like Jorace, Brandenburg is something of a slave driver; unlike Jorace,
she does not inspire loyalty. She is, however, very good at making money
and thus has a great deal of sycophants and hangers-on in her entourage.

#### Peter Brookings

Peter Brookings is a venture capitalist who has decided to sink his
money into a number of different opportunities in the system, including
a skim-mining rig over Enkidu and an asteroid-based processing facility.
Brookings has moved himself and his family into the system (they stay in
the Inner Ring) to better guide his investments. He invested in the Phase
II portion of Siduri Station, buying out the stake of one of the previous
Consortium members and putting in enough cash back in to nearly equal
the stake of Virette Brandenburg (who hates him vehemently). His stake
of the Consortium is currently 18%.

Brookings has a laid-back personal style and considers his employees
and underlings to be ‘colleagues’ (one of his favourite words). He
stresses original thinking and the need to approach problems from a
different perspective.

#### Oliver O’Hallaran

Oliver O’Halloran is the only member of the initial Consortium Board who
was not a wildcatter. O’Halloran ran a tramp starship line, which went
from two to eight ships before he was bought out by investors. After
paying off his debts, O’Halloran decided to sink a portion of his remaining
funds into the Consortium, as the system was a place he knew well on
his trade run and the other Consortium members were individuals with
whom he not only had a great deal of trust in but had values he admired.
His was one of the smaller stakes (the rest of his money having gone into
other investments) initially, although he placed more of his money into
the Consortium during Phase II, raising his stake to 11.2%.

O’Hallaran spends much of his time outside of the system. He has
married since investing in the Consortium and spends much of his time
with his wife and three daughters, the eldest of whom is coming of age

and spends more time on Siduri Station than he does. In fact, Jennifer
O’Halloran may well receive the shares of her father in the Consortium
soon, as she has a great deal of interest in the Station and has been
studying habitat management rather intensely.
```

#### Talia Ghardishan

```
Talia Ghardishan is not strictly a member of the Consortium but she does
officially represent the off-world investment bureau Saarbar Landesbank
AG (SLAG) and votes on their behalf. She has an apartment on
Siduri Station but spends much of her time looking after SLAG’s other
investments in other nearby systems and thus spends very little time on-
station. SLAG owns 10% of the stake in the Consortium.
```

```
Ghardishan is a no-nonsense personality, likeable but definitely out for her
own interests at all times. Oliver O’Hallaran has expressed open dislike of
her and petitioned SLAG to appoint a new representative but the reasons
for his intense feelings have not been manifest to the other members of the
Consortium. For her own part, Ghardishan takes it all in apparent stride.
```

#### Kairavi Channar

```
Kairavi Channar is a retired Rear Admiral and another investor in
the skim-mining rigs over Enkidu. Admiral Channar has always been
interested in this system, as she spent some time here on the former
Enkidu Highport when she was injured and fought a major engagement
against a group of pirates who thought that skim-mining operations
were easy targets. She currently has neither friends nor enemies on
the Consortium Board but respects Harlan Jorace and gets along well
with both Brookings and O’Hallaran.
```

#### Siduri station Umbrella Corporation

```
61
```

Whatever feelings she has towards Ghardishan or Brandenburg, she
keeps to herself.

Kairavi Channar has, as one might suspect, a disciplined personal style
but is also well-known for being a good leader who demands much, gives
much and gets good results. She does not expect perfection but believes
in drilling constantly to hone skills. She does have a strict view on law-
and-order (again, as one might suspect) and cleaned up some of the more
dodgy elements from the station after she placed a not inconsiderable
part of her severance from the military into the Consortium. This was just
before the Phase II went online and these funds proved to be necessary at
a critical juncture. Nonetheless, she is presently the smallest stakeholder
in the Consortium at 7.1%.

#### Smaller Investors

One former member of the Consortium, Ivan Lomax, was killed on
Shemhat during a mining accident before Phase II started. His shares
at the time were offered up to the members in equal portions under the
bylaws. Jorace and Brandenburg absorbed these shares but the other
two surviving members excused themselves. Some of the released
shares are on the local stock markets of several adjoining systems and
still trading in private hands (amounting to a 3.7% of the stakes after
Phase II).

### CHIEF ADMINISTRATOR

The day-to-day management of the Station has been turned over
to a professional, former Port Authority Supervisor Garrett Patrick.
Administrator Patrick is a gregarious individual, who is known for
getting the job done. While many seem to feel Patrick is soft, he can be
implacable when required and is not afraid to take risks when needed.
He and his wife, who runs a legal affairs business of her own in the Outer
Ring, live on the station and rarely leave. Administrator Patrick takes
a regular (although rotating) shift along with everyone else in the HQ,
as well as several other divisions (maintenance, medical, warehousing).
This has given him a good feel for the station. He gets along with nearly
all of the Consortium Board, with the exception of Admiral Channar who
thinks he is a lightweight, and Talia Ghardishan, who prefers to send
messages through his subordinates. Administrator Patrick is closest to
Peter Brookings and, after that, Harlan Jorace.

### SECURITY

Balistika Sekureco (Ballistic Security) is a firm hired to provide the
security on the station. The same company covers security contracts on
several of Enkidu’s rigs as well as the station and is headquartered in the
next coreward system. There are 120 members of the team on Siduri,
which operate in three shifts of 40.

62

```
Approximately 15 of the security personnel man checkpoints around the
station and 20 more perform one- and two-man patrols. The final five
of the on-shift personnel are located in the security centre, including a
coordinator and assistant coordinator and three on monitoring duty.
```

```
The Balistika team has their own barracks in the Inner Ring, which
includes housing facilities as well as an isolated gym and training
facility. The Balistika team is headed by Lt. Jalyan Rhys-Smith, a
retired marine and former law enforcement officer. In addition to the
Sekureco personnel, there are 18 station security personnel on Siduri
Station, divided into three shifts of six, who help man the monitoring
room, perform any investigations as needed and generally support the
Sekureco personnel. If the Sekureco Contract is severed (by either
party), these are the individuals who will serve as the ‘institutional
memory’ of the station, security-wise.
```

```
The Station Security group is headed by Adisa Ajanlekoko, a former Navy
chief who once served under Admiral Channar. Chief Ajanlekoko and Lt.
Rhys-Smith get along relatively well, trying not to superimpose their will
on one another; the chief also gives the lieutenant the lead, considering
her personnel outnumber his and she has more experience during her
brief time as a civilian law enforcement officer.

## SEASTRIKE

Maritime operations are often overlooked in Traveller games, since most
combat takes place in space or around cities – which are for the most part
built on dry land. However, it is possible for system defence boats and
other craft to hide in bodies of water. They may even encounter enemy
units whilst submerged, which presents some unusual challenges.

## SENSOR OPERATIONS

Water (and similar fluids) can have curious effects on a vessel’s
sensor systems, especially if not calibrated to deal with the underwater
environment. Water transmits sound extremely well, so sensor
equipment may pick-up distant underwater landslides, turbulence
and assorted sea life. Unless a vessel has acoustic sensors (which
is unlikely on spacecraft), these sounds will manifest as disturbances
interfering with other systems.

The sensor equipment of vessels designed for space will not be damaged
by submersion to a modest depth but unfurling large equipment such as
a distributed array – or moving with one deployed – may impose shearing
forces upon it that will break supports not designed for such loads. Hull-
mounted sensors and any system within a vessel’s streamlining will be
unharmed by underwater movement, although they may be subject to
pressure effects in deep water.

The general underwater hubbub will affect shipboard sensors only slightly,
imposing DM-1 on sensor operations, but attempting to use sensors
across the water/atmosphere interface presents a number of problems.
Radar and similar sensors are scattered by the surface layer, making it
hard to detect and track a target above the surface from underneath it
and even more difficult the other way around.

The result is DM-2 on all sensor operations crossing the surface. In
addition, there is DM-2 on attempts to detect a submerged vehicle or
spacecraft plus the DM-1 for using sensors underwater. Thus a ship
above the surface attempting to detect one beneath it suffers DM-4 on
Electronics (sensors) checks and the submerged vessel suffers DM-3 to
track the airborne target.

In addition, the range of sensors not designed for underwater work is
greatly attenuated. Optical sensors, including thermal cameras, have a
useful range measured in tens of metres and may be entirely useless
without powerful external lights.

64

```
Radar and similar sensors have a useful range of 100 metres per TL of
the suite, within which they work normally but with the penalties listed
previously. Radar can possibly detect a target out to five times that
far but the power levels required will give away the sensing vessel’s
position to any detector in the area, even ships in orbit, and sensor
checks suffer an additional DM-2 for every multiple of their base
range. Thus a TL10 radar system can be used with the usual DM-1
for underwater sensor use out to one kilometre, suffering an additional
DM-2 to two kilometres, DM-4 to four kilometres and so forth. These
penalties do not apply if the sensor is being used from a shallow depth
to detect and track airborne targets.
```

```
Densitometers and neural activity sensors work normally underwater but
are of limited combat use. NAS units may be swamped by the amount of
neural activity going on in a typical body of water – fish are not smart but
there may be a lot of them.
```

### ACOUSTIC SENSORS

```
It is unusual to find acoustic sensors fitted to a vessel not intended
for underwater work, which is itself a rather uncommon application
for spacecraft. Thus an acoustic sensor module is not included in any
standard package. Acoustic sensors include hydrophones and sonar
systems; the former are highly sensitive microphones that pick-up
underwater sounds, while the latter send out pulses in active mode to
search for obstructions or targets, or be used to detect other vessels’
sonar emissions.
```

```
Acoustic sensors are supported by processing equipment appropriate
to their Tech Level. The most basic systems display a blip and give an
indication of range; more advanced systems can identify or even map
a target by its acoustic signature or reflections, and have an additional
advantage; a vessel with basic or better acoustic sensors does not
suffer the usual DM-1 for operating other sensors underwater – the
processing equipment can be calibrated to help conventional sensor
gear filter out interference.
```

```
Fitting acoustic sensors to a vessel requires adding hydrophones and
emitter/receivers all over the hull, and is quite a lengthy job. This sensor
equipment does not take up additional space but must be protected
against the more usual conditions encountered by a starship, otherwise
the detectors will be scrubbed off the first time the ship enters atmosphere.
```

```
Minimal Acoustic Sensors: A minimal sensor fit can be cobbled together
in the field or created at TL5 or above. Both will end up costing about the
same and have similar characteristics. A minimal acoustic sensor fit has
little processing capability and cannot be used to offset the underwater
sensor penalty. Minimal acoustic sensors have an effective range of one
kilometre and cost Cr10 per ton of the vessel’s hull.
```

```
65
```

Basic Acoustic Sensors: A basic sensor kit can be built at TL6. It
includes depth-finding sonar as well as target detection and tracking
systems. Basic acoustic sensors can be used to offset the DM-1 for
using conventional sensors underwater. Effective range is about two
kilometres and the cost is Cr25 per ton of the vessel’s hull.

Enhanced Acoustic Sensors: Enhanced acoustic sensors are
available at TL7 and add detailed mapping functions within half of
their effective range, gaining DM+1 to detect and analyse underwater
targets at all ranges. Effective range is five kilometres and the cost is
Cr50 per ton of hull.

Advanced Acoustic Sensors: Advanced acoustic sensors are available
at TL9 and have greatly increased range, performing detailed mapping
functions within half their effective range. They grant DM+2 to detect
and analyse underwater targets at all ranges. Effective range is ten
kilometres and the cost is Cr100 per ton of hull.

Magnetic Anomaly Detectors: Magnetic Anomaly Detectors (MAD),
also known as magnetometers, detect disturbances in a planetary
magnetic field (if one exists), enabling metallic or magnetic objects to be
passively detected at a distance. A TL8 MAD has an effective range of
two kilometres and at TL10 this increases to five kilometres, assuming
a sizable amount of magnetic material such as a submarine, surface
vessel or submerged starship; a MAD cannot detect a non-magnetic
object. MADs can be confused by magnetic storms, ECM, large metallic
objects (such as shipwrecks) and large deposits of magnetic ore. A MAD
suitable for mounting on a spacecraft costs Cr25000.

### WEAPONS

It can be assumed that any weapon designed to operate in space can be
taken underwater without suffering harm, provided it is not actually used.
If weapons not designed for underwater operations are fired, special
considerations apply.

#### Firing Weapons Underwater

No projectile weapons, other than missiles and special devices such
as spearguns, will function well underwater. Weapons can be fired or
launched from a submerged vessel or vehicle with the barrel of the
weapon protruding above the surface. In this case, the weapon must be
modified, mainly to enable water to be quickly drained from the barrel but
standard projectiles can still be used.

Modifying a weapon to be used in this manner adds 50% to its mass
(or displacement) and cost. Providing the draining process has been
completed, a gun of this sort can be fired normally at any target above

66

```
water. A modification of this sort also allows missiles to be launched
underwater, either upwards through the surface or at underwater targets.
The launch system uses compressed gas to push the missile out of the
launcher before its motor ignites, preventing damage to the launch tube.
```

```
Targeting can be a problem when operating across the atmosphere/water
interface. DM-2 applies when launching missiles from a submerged vessel
at a target above the surface. DM-4 applies when firing at a target that is
also submerged. Missiles can be modified to use underwater targeting
systems (these are not normally fitted to weapons intended for use in
atmosphere or in space), which increases the cost of the weapon by 10%.
This underwater targeting system reduces the penalty from DM-4 to DM-2.
```

#### Guns

```
Projectile weapons are virtually useless underwater. Range is reduced to 5
metres per damage dice of the weapon, after which the projectile sinks into
the depths. Specialist underwater projectiles increase this to 25 metres per
damage dice and cost three times as much as standard ammunition.
```

```
Firing a high-velocity projectile underwater is likely to damage the weapon
due to barrel pressure and the projectile itself will not travel far. Roll 2D
each time the weapon is fired. On 10+ the gun’s barrel will rupture and its
mechanism will be damaged. On 12+ the damage is sufficiently serious
to allow water to enter the firing vessel or vehicle.
```

#### Missiles

```
Since spacecraft must sometimes fight in a gas giant’s atmosphere, their
missiles are assumed to be built to with stand the stresses involved. These
can be greater than those encountered underwater, so it is not necessary
to build special missiles for underwater use. Similarly, launchers and
other equipment will withstand immersion indefinitely. Control, however,
may be a problem.
```

```
Because missiles exit the launcher more slowly and under power, there
is little chance of barrel rupture. However, water vapourised by the motor
can create overpressure. Roll 2D for every missile launched. On 12+ the
launcher is put out of action. Missile range is reduced to 1/10 of normal
range against airborne/ground targets or 1/1,000 of space combat range.
This applies only to missiles travelling underwater; those fired from a
launcher above or just under the surface function normally.
```

#### Lasers

```
Lasers are easily dispersed by water. Beams lose significant amounts
of energy as they pass through water, vapourising it to create an
expanding tunnel of bubbles. The thermal signature of a laser fired
underwater is hard to miss and there will be a visual indication when
the bubbles reach the surface.
```

```
67
```

A conventional laser fired underwater may be damaged. Roll 2D each
time a weapon is fired; on 11+ the weapon is put out of action although
there is no real chance this will lead to a hull breach or serious leak. To
avoid this possibility a laser weapon can be modified for underwater use,
increasing its cost and mass by 15%.

Vehicle and personal scale laser weapons also suffer -1 to damage per
metre of water they penetrate. Starship-grade lasers lose -1 point of
damage per 10 metres of water they penetrate. In addition, a laser fired
at an underwater target suffers DM-2 to its attack rolls, with an additional
DM-2 if the weapon must fire through the air/water interface, either from
above at a submerged target or vice versa.

#### Other Energy Weapons

Meson weapons can be used underwater or against underwater targets
without modification and are probably the most lethal armament for
maritime vessels. Some worlds use submarine-mounted meson guns
for planetary defence, hiding in deep water and moving to prevent a
counterstrike from finding them.

Other energy weapons are much less effective. Particle accelerator
weapons cannot be used underwater and will not penetrate the surface
of a body of water. Plasma and fusion guns will destroy themselves
if fired underwater unless heavily modified, adding 75% to cost and
mass. Even then, the weapon suffers a -2 to damage per metre of
water penetrated. On a 2D roll of 9+ a plasma or fusion gun (whether

68

```
modified or not) delivers half its normal damage against the firing craft
regardless of whether or not it hits a target.
```

### PERISCOPES

```
Periscopes can be built into a spacecraft; there are many types of
periscope for observation, communication and offensive use. It is unusual
to find one fitted to a starship unless it is a specialist design intended for
underwater operations of a military or scientific nature.
```

```
Simple Optical periscopes have a fixed-angle lens and no intensification
or enhancement features. They are small and inconspicuous, presenting
minimal radar reflection. A simple periscope costs Cr25000.
```

```
Compound Optical periscopes have zoom lenses, controls for tilt and
close focusing, and fittings for cameras and image enhancement devices.
At TL7 they can be computer-controlled, linked to gunnery computers
and other special equipment. A compound periscope costs Cr50000.
```

```
Radio and Radar Antennae are bare metal masts with appropriate cable
systems or a buoy to carry an antenna to the surface whilst the ship
remains submerged. No communications or detection equipment is
included in this price. Cost is Cr10000.
```

```
Laser Communicator/Target Designation periscopes are complex
optical designs and can be used for normal observation. They allow a
vessel or vehicle equipped with laser systems to use its own sensors
and designators through the periscope. A laser comms periscope costs
Cr150000.
```

```
Turret periscopes allow a turret to be raised above the surface and fired
while the ship remains just below the surface. A turret periscope on a
ship costs MCr2, is available at TL8 and adds +1 tons to the turret. On a
vehicle, it doubles the cost of the turret as well as the number of Spaces it
requires. Mounts of this sort are normally found on craft in the aerospace
defence role, enabling them to engage aircraft or space vessels. Some
system defence boats use the weapon for the same purpose or to
ambush vessels landing at a port close to a body of water.

## IMPERIAL MARINE

## TASK FORCE ORGANISATION

The Imperial Marine Corps was originally formed as an adjunct to the
naval forces but has developed into a complete combat service in its own
right. The marines provide a rapid strike capability or rapid-deployment
defensive force. They also protect naval installations and the facilities of
the unarmed services such as embassies. The Marine Corps enforces
interstellar law in frontier areas, notably the Imperial Rules of War. For
this reason some mercenaries refer to the marines as ‘the cops’.

The Marine Corps uses a very flexible organizational structure, as it may
have to deploy anything from a detachment of 10 marines to an all-arms
combat division. Marine regiments exist for administrative rather than
combat purposes; task forces are formed out of available units as the
need arises.

A marine regiment contains three task force headquarters units plus
(usually) nine marine companies and various smaller units performing
specialist functions. Units are assigned to a headquarters to create a
force of whatever size and composition may be required. These units
may not be entirely complete; it is not uncommon for a marine company
to be missing one of its platoons, which has been broken up to provide
small contingents here and there. Where possible, companies providing
detachments in this manner are kept out of large-scale combat forces.
Personnel not assigned to detachments receive training or protect the
unit’s base. Any given company will rotate through large and small
scale deployments, gaining experience of all operation types.

## EXAMPLE MARINE TASK FORCE

The example task force presented here is on wartime deployment
as a significant combat force. It is light on administrative and support
capabilities as these are provided by higher echelon formations or the
Imperial Navy but has the support of a meson gun battery. The main
combat capability of the force is its marine infantry companies. A force
expected to operate independently for any length of time would be given
more logistics and support units, whilst one expecting to engage in
mobile operations in the field might be assigned a force of grav tanks
from the regimental pool.

70

```
All vehicles other than air/rafts have a dedicated crew. This is usually
a driver and gunner, although it can include additional personnel if
the vehicle has a specialist function. Air/rafts are militarised versions
of the basic open-topped civilian design and can act as mobile fire
support posts using a pintle mounted weapon. The two-man scout
teams (one air/raft pilot, one observer/gunner) are often retasked to
carry out this role.
```

```
Since the force is operating primarily as infantry, vehicles are considered
to be part of an infantry unit rather than being separately commanded.
Thus a grav APC with part of an infantry platoon riding in it is part of the
infantry unit’s command structure rather than there being a command
vehicle for the APCs of the platoon. A squad’s APC is considered to be
part of the squad and commanded by its leader. APCs are capable of
offering light fire support to their personnel and may remain in proximity
during combat or retire to a safe laager point.
```

#### Headquarters

```
The composition of a force command HQ
is almost always the same. This ensures
that if a marine task force is deployed
it will have certain capabilities including
dampers to protect against nuclear attack,
communications, intelligence analysis and
medical support.

The headquarters contains most of the unit’s grav vehicles, which

assigned, some for unit commanders and others for scouting purposes.
In practice, these vehicles are often away from their parent formation;
running errands or transporting a handful of personnel to deal with
urgent situations.

#### Marine Squad

```
Marine squads are more self-reliant than their army equivalents, as a
squad (with or without an officer) may be detached to serve aboard a
small warship or protect an installation. In combat, marine squads are no
less effective at working together as part of a higher force but personnel
at all levels are trained to display aggression and initiative with minimal
reliance on other units or supports to solve problems. That does not mean
a squad will not call in meson gun fire on an enemy position but marines
are not in the habit of waiting around for an ideal support package to
become available.
```

```
A marine squad is composed of two four-man fire teams plus a squad
leader. The APC driver and gunner are considered to be part of the squad
when on deployment but at base the vehicles are grouped together for
administrative purposes. However, squads train together (including APC
crew), which allows smooth and reliable infantry/vehicle cooperation
in the field. All marines intended to fight as infantry are equipped with
battle dress and FGMP-14s. Vehicle crews and specialists normally use
combat armor and have gauss rifles available if necessary but can don
battle dress and fight alongside the rest of the squad at need. Every
marine is a fighter first and a specialist second.
```

#### Meson Battery

```
The task force’s meson battery is assigned from the pool of support
units available to the regiment. Meson artillery has the advantage that
its particles can pass through solid matter, enabling the engagement
of targets unavailable to conventional artillery or direct fire weapons.
The battery consist of four firing sections, a security element and
command section.
```

```
73
```

The battery normally receives targeting data and support requests from
the line infantry but has its own forward observers who use the command
section’s air/rafts. It is not uncommon to find one of these vehicles
assigned temporarily to each line company during an engagement. Each
firing section is a single meson gun sled, which are usually dispersed
to avoid counter-battery fire. The marine squads of the security section
are equipped and organised the same as those of the line company. The
section leader is assigned the air/raft but in practice it is often co-opted
by the battery command section for miscellaneous tasks.

#### Equipment

The personal equipment of the task force is noted above – most
personnel fight with FGMP-14s and wear battle dress. Gauss weapons
are available for security details where battle dress is not appropriate
and snub weapons are normally used aboard ship.

Grav APCs are capable of carrying the full squad and providing support with
a rapid-pulse plasma gun. Under some circumstances missiles are also
carried, which may or may not have nuclear warheads. The support APC
is based on the same chassis but gives up some of its troop complement to
make room for a larger power plant and fuel tanks. It is armed with a heavy
fusion gun for direct-fire support. Similarly, the point-defence APCs have
limited space for passengers but mount rapid-fire gatling laser systems for
aerospace and missile defence. They are sometimes used for direct fire
support against ‘soft’ targets such as light vehicles and infantry.

- Fuel Sled

74

```
The force’s grav sleds are more lightly protected than the APCs and
not intended for direct combat operations. All are based on the same
chassis and the majority mount a gauss gun for self-defence. This
includes ambulances, although medical vehicles will normally only
shoot if they are directly threatened. This can mean choosing not to
support nearby troops under attack but since most combatants will
respect the status of ambulances providing they do not open fire, the
tradeoff is generally beneficial.
```

### DOCTRINE

```
Marine forces generally operate in conjunction with naval assets and
often benefit from orbital reconnaissance. Naval gunfire support may be
available, depending upon the situation, but in any case the Imperial
Marine Corps usually enjoys a technological superiority over its
opponents. Where enemies are equipped to TL11+, the marines have
to be cautious but lower-tech enemies often have few weapons that can
harm a marine in battle dress. Those they do have tend to be large and
clumsy, and vehicle-mounted.
```

```
A marine’s fusion gun can kill a mid-tech tank and mid-tech aircraft simply
cannot survive in airspace swept by TL14 aerospace defence weapons.
A marine task force can punch a hole right through a conventional force
many times its size, dismounting from its APCs only to take enemy
commanders captive. This capability is offset by the fact the marine corps
is spread thin, meaning that very small forces are often expected to obtain
big results. The training, equipment and mindset of the marines corps is
geared towards this.
```

```
Against more advanced enemies, a marine task force can expect a
tougher fight. However, it is equipped for rapid movement and has the
capability to deploy at least some of its personnel directly from orbit onto
critical targets. Marine forces are often used as a spearhead to secure
government centres and other strategic locations whilst the army makes
a large-scale invasion. Deprived of central direction, many enemy forces
simply collapse.
```

```
In the field, a marine task force emphasises aggression, mobility and
firepower. Its APCs are not tanks, although they are better protected
than many mid- to high-tech combat vehicles. Squad APCs, with support
and sometimes point-defence APCs, can dash to a critical point and
overwhelm an enemy with firepower but they cannot take on heavy grav
armor. If such a clash is expected, the task force will be assigned tanks
from the regimental reserve.
```

```
75
```

Overall, the marine corps is a hammer, designed to shatter resistance
and end a conflict before it has begun. Its task forces are expected to
take on any opponent, in any environment, under any conditions. For this
they need a flexible organization in which the individual marine can make
intelligent and courageous decisions, sometimes acting entirely alone.
This is the highest principle of the marine corps – every member is a
combatant first and foremost, and nobody fights like an Imperial Marine.

### 7TH MARINE REGIMENT

###### (Spinward Marches

###### Contingent)

```
The 7th Marine Regiment has an
unbroken history going back to the first
years of the Imperium. The secret of its
longevity is dispersion; the 7th has at
least a small presence in most sectors.
The Spinward Marches component
of the regiment has four battalions
at peacetime strength, although
these are normally dispersed in
smaller contingents. The 7th
also acts as a training cadre
for new marines and can
raise several companies
of troops in various
stages of training.
These personnel all
wear the standard
colour scheme of the
7th, exchanging it for a new set of
insignia and uniform modifications
when assigned to their final unit.

## A DAGGER AT EFATE

```
Location : Efate (A646930-D) Regina subsector, Spinward Marches
```

```
The mercenary cruiser Dagger, currently on contract to the Imperial
authorities, has been missing for some months. It has now reappeared,
on a direct course for the Imperial world of Efate. The Travellers are
assigned to board the craft, which is not answering communications and
determine what has happened to it.
```

```
The adventure assumes that a major battle is occurring in the Efate
system and Imperial resources are stretched thin.
```

## EFATE

```
Efate is a heavily industrialised, high-tech world close to the Imperial
border and thus a vital strategic objective in any conflict. It is the site
of both Navy and Scout bases, and has a significant Imperial Army
contingent in place as well as its own indigenous forces. Efate has seen
a lot of unrest in recent years and is in the throes of a bogged-down
counter-insurgency campaign. Although Amber Zone status has not
been imposed, visitors are advised to be cautious.

-The small brushfire war that has sputtered off and on
-for several years on this frontier world has, within the

-for the sudden build-up and the general plan of action.
-The continuing protracted nature of the insurgency
-action on Efate had been a mounting drain on manpower
-resources and begun to sap the morale of indigenous
-troops. As a result, the decision was made to concentrate
-maximum effort to end the conflict in the shortest

-Maximum effort is the only way to describe
-the amazing build-up that has taken place overnight.
-Already official circulars list eleven brigade-sized

### THE SITUATION

```
The mercenary cruiser Dagger was hired on an emergency basis by
the Imperial Military Resource Board for supplemental operations in the
Efate system of the Regina subsector in late 1106 and served on ordinary
duties for several months. In early 1107, local rebels mustered forces and
mounted a breakout with a rag-tag accumulation of several converted
commercial ships. Fearing this operation was a diversion meant to sap
Imperial blockade forces and yet unwilling to let the rebel task force go,
Rear Admiral Santeenochev’s staff dispatched several hired vessels in
pursuit. Mercenary cruiser Dagger was one of them. It left on less than
an hour’s notice, leaving behind its troop unit.
```

```
Four months later, a battle is raging in the Efate system and the Imperial
Command has gradually committed every available ship to the fray. The
Travellers, aboard a merchant or scout, have just entered the system,
completed all necessary identification procedures with system control
and are now proceeding toward Efate.
```

```
System Control Efate communicates that mercenary cruiser Dagger has
just emerged from jump space close to the Travellers’ ship and is not
acknowledging attempts to make contact. Nor is it manoeuvring, which
suggests it may be in need of help. Since all available naval vessels
are engaged in the battle on the far side of the system, System Control
instructs the Travellers’ ship to investigate and render assistance as
required. This is within the bounds of interstellar law and with so much
military activity in the system the Travellers might be ill-advised to disobey.
```

### MERCENARY CRUISER DAGGER

```
Dagger is lifeless and unmanned. Its controls have been wrecked and
the ship’s computer has been largely disabled. All remaining functions
are carried out automatically, with little intelligence on the part of the
ship’s systems.
```

```
Dagger will maneuver slightly to make docking very difficult, requiring
either a highly aggressive boarding maneuver with a Very Difficult
(12+) Pilot check (DEX) or close pass to allow personnel to jump across
in vacc suits with a Formidable (14+) Vacc Suit check (DEX). Both are
hazardous undertakings but achievable. The Travellers may come up
with other solutions.
```

```
Once aboard, it becomes apparent that the ship is lifeless. Only the
emergency lights are on and life support is operating at a minimal level. The
Referee might choose to play this situation for tension, with the Travellers
wondering if there are hostile humans or aliens waiting in ambush.
```

```
79
```

Reaching the bridge and engineering areas the Travellers discover the
same story; controls are not only smashed but electronics have been
gutted and, quite possibly, sold or used elsewhere. Jury-rigging a control
system would take at least 36 hours and the Travellers do not have that
long. Dagger is headed directly for Efate, on a pre-programed course
that will take it into the atmosphere. Plotting the target area indicates
the primary Imperial troop concentration on the planet is in danger. This
cannot possibly be coincidence.

Dagger will hit the upper atmosphere in a little over eight hours. If the
Travellers are aboard at that point they will be unable to leave before the
ship plunges into the ground. The obvious solution is to alter the ship’s
course so it misses Efate or, ideally, to bring it under control.

There is an additional problem, which the Travellers may or may not
discover; a five-megaton nuclear device has been concealed within the
vessel. It is connected to a set of sensors that will detect if the ship
is landed on any vacuum world or passes close enough to a vessel of
1,000 tons displacement or more (dealing 1DD damage). The device
itself is well concealed but the sensors might be found by Travellers
investigating the ship using a Very Difficult (12+) Investigate check
(INT). Tracing control pathways will lead to the bomb with a successful
Electronics (sensors) check (INT).

As for the guidance system, the ship is currently being controlled by
an extremely dumb, lobotomised version of its computer. The machine
could be confused by false data fed from its remaining sensors with a
successful Electronics (sensors) check (INT), fooling it into changing
course. Alternatively, it might be possible to hack the damaged computer
with a successful Electronics (computers) check (INT), although its
responses will be unpredictable and possibly dangerous.

It will seem likely that Dagger was captured by the rebels at some point;
internal damage from a boarding action confirms this if the Travellers look
for it. The question of where she has been and where the rebels got a big
nuclear warhead is a more complex one. If the ship is destroyed there
will be no way to find out, which is a strong argument against schemes
like using the nuke to blast the ship apart so that fragments are too small
to cause damage. That plan also involves setting off a nuclear detonation
in orbit over an industrialised world but the Travellers might not care too
much about such niceties. The authorities will, however.

# TRAVELLINGTRAVELLING

## NON-MAINWORLDS

```
For our purposes, the term non-mainworlds refers to planetary bodies
that are not the main inhabited world of a system and specifically
excludes planetoids and gas giants. Typically, the mainworld of a system
will be the most habitable planet or the one with the best resources. This
is not always the case, such as where a habitable world is economically
unsuitable or a resource-rich one is extremely hostile. In such cases the
system’s primary population will dwell elsewhere and exploit resources
with temporary expeditions or resource-extraction camps inhabited on a
transient basis by workers who live elsewhere.
```

GENERATING

## NON-MAINWORLDS

```
The Traveller star system design rules focus on mainworlds and is,
in general, not suitable for non-mainworlds. Since the mainworld is
the most important place in the system as far as most Travellers are
concerned, the rules generate it in terms of atmosphere, hydrographics,
temperature and so forth, and the Referee then decides where it is
located in the system. This is entirely sufficient when the focus is on that
mainworld but the same process cannot be used to create a plausible
star system – there is simply no possibility of finding a lush, green world
with a breathable atmosphere orbiting so far out that its star is just a
distant speck in the sky.
```

```
When generating a non-mainworld, use the following procedure.
```

```
Size
Roll 2D-2 for Size as normal.
If Size 10 is indicated, roll 2D again: on 11+ the world is in fact a super-
Earth.
```

```
Atmosphere
Roll Atmosphere as normal, with the usual modifiers for size.
Any Atmosphere code that is not 0, 1 A, B or C should be reset to A
(exotic). The original code as generated can be used as an indicator of
atmospheric pressure.
```

```
Hydrographics
Roll Hydrographics as normal, using the Atmosphere code. Apply DM-
if the world is in the hot zone.
```

### 81

Population
Population should be assigned by the Referee in most cases and
will usually be zero. This does not necessarily mean there is no-one
there – a world could have a small number of scientists, prospectors
and perhaps hidden ne’er-do-wells present at any time but would still
be considered uninhabited. If random determination is desirable, roll
Population on 2D-8.

Government
Most installations and small outposts have no government as such

- they answer to an outside agency such as a parent government or
corporation. If a UWP code is necessary, assign code 6. To randomly
generate independent settlements, roll 10+ on 2D for a community
to be self-governing, with a DM equal to the Population code. A self-
governing community should be assigned a suitable code to indicate the
Government type the Referee has chosen. Corporate control is most
common but many small communities are created by groups with strong
views and may have quite extreme Government types.

Law Level
Law Level is determined normally.

Tech Level
The Tech Level for an installation owned by a larger organization will be
equal to that of the parent government or corporation. For independent

**Example of World Creation**

Diameter: 11,200km

Government: Captive Government
Law Level: 9+ (2D-7+6=10)
Tech Level: 8
```

### 82

```
installations, Tech Level should be suitable to reflect the local average
starfaring tech – typically around 10-12 in the Third Imperium universe.
Alternatively, Tech Level can be determined on a roll of 1D+7. Note that
the presence of this level of technological knowledge does not equate to
the ability to produce large amounts of goods at that Tech Level.
```

```
Another option when generating non-mainworlds is to simply assign them
UWP values appropriate to their position in the system. The Referee
should feel free to place non-mainworld societies wherever they are
likely to be interesting or relevant to the Travellers’ activities.
```

```
WITHIN THE THIRD IMPERIUM
In the Third Imperium universe, most worlds are self-governing but the
Imperium has jurisdiction over the space between them. The status of
possessions such as mining installations on a non-mainworld can vary.
Technically, any unclaimed territory not part of the mainworld belongs to
the Imperium but by long-standing tradition a credible claim to territory
elsewhere in its home system put forward by a member world is likely
to be honored.
```

```
To be credible, a claim must be reasonable and enforceable. A low-
tech world that can only just manage to build railways cannot make a
reasonable claim to the mineral resources of a gas giant moon in the
outsystem but a world that has access to vessels capable of reaching
the claimed site, and which can build a suitable installation, there could
do so. Territorial claims are processed by local Imperial authorities and
in the case of a dispute the local mainworld government is almost always
given precedence. However, blanket claims to whole planetary bodies or
entire star systems are rejected and it is quite possible for independent
concerns to own large amounts of real estate in a star system.
```

```
In a few rare cases, what started out as an independent installation
might grow into what amounts to a small state in its own right. It is more
common for such offworld territories to fall under the jurisdiction of the
mainworld government or remain possessions of a parent body such
as a mining corporation but sometimes a moon or even a whole planet
can become a state in its own right. If so, the secondary government is
normally granted membership of the Imperium but does not have the
same territorial rights as the native government. This situation is quite
rare, however; most non-mainworld populations are quite small and take
the form of a city-state within the Imperium rather than a member world.
```

```
OUTSIDE THE IMPERIUM
Other interstellar polities may follow the same model as Imperial authorities
but where there is no over-arching political body the situation tends to be
a free-for-all. World governments with the capability to enforce territorial
```

### 83

ambitions often claim their entire home system as sovereign territory and
may fight to defend it even if this means an apparently pointless conflict
over a scrap of rock in the outsystem. Others negotiate a lease, often at a
token price for the sake of form. Governments that do not have the ability
to send armed space vessels to their outsystem may still claim it but such
declarations are unenforceable.

It is quite possible for a free-for-all to exist, with multiple micro-states
existing throughout the system. These are often of an economic nature,
in which case cooperation is common but some micro-states are highly
isolationist or part of a political organization based outside the system.
The situation can become highly complex where some bodies in a
system are part of an alliance based elsewhere, some are part of a
local economic organization and others just want to be left alone or at
least remain independent.

As a rule, even where a system contains multiple independent
settlements there will be hubs of commerce that tend to prosper to a
greater degree than other communities. Often the system’s mainworld
is the primary centre for commerce and equipment supply, serving the
independent outsystem communities and making money off them even
if it does not control their actions. This is not always the case however;
a major mining installation operated by a large corporation may receive
more interstellar traffic than a backwater mainworld, with the mainworld
acting mainly as a source of fresh food and a place to take vacation
time outside a sealed environment.

TYPES OF NON-MAINWORLD

In general, the most habitable planet in a system becomes its mainworld.
It is uncommon, but not unknown, for there to be more than one habitable
world in a system but as a rule most non-mainworlds are located outside
the ‘warm zone’ of the system and require life support equipment for
human habitation. It is this expense, as much as anything else, that
dictates which planet in a system is colonized and which are, at most,
used for resource extraction.

Hot Zone Worlds
Worlds located closer to the primary than the mainworld receive more
stellar energy and are difficult to colonize, although may possess
good mineral resources. Those close to the inner fringe of the warm
zone may be relatively welcoming, often possessing an atmospheric
envelope with an exotic gas mix that requires less protective equipment
than hard vacuum or trace atmospheres. Those closer to the primary
will tend to be small and have little in the way of atmosphere. Any water
present will be deep underground or locked as exotic compounds.
There are exceptions, of course; gas giants and super-earth worlds are
known to exist very close to stars.

### 84

```
Life, at least in the conventional sense, is unlikely to exist on a hot-zone
world due to extreme conditions. Many planets in this zone are tidally
locked, with a ‘bright face’ always facing the primary and a ‘cold face’
in eternal night. Between the two is a ‘twilight zone’ that is less extreme
in its conditions and it is usually here that installations are built. The
twilight zone can be quite turbulent on worlds that have more than a
trace atmosphere.
```

```
The economic advantage of exploiting hot-zone worlds is that they are
closer to the common mainworld locations than outsystem resource sites.
Getting ore or minerals to market can still be a problem when the planets’
orbits place them on opposite sides of the star but as a rule transit times
are still lower than hauling all the way out to an outsystem rockball.
```

```
Hot zone worlds may have any Size code, tending to be smaller the
further they orbit. Atmosphere is likely to be exotic if present at all;
otherwise hot zone worlds tend to have at most a trace atmosphere.
Hydrographics are almost certain to be zero for inner-orbit worlds but can
have any value on worlds that have an atmosphere.
```

```
Warm Zone Non-Mainworlds
If there is more than one planet within or on the fringes of the system’s
warm zone, the best prospect usually becomes the mainworld and the
other – in rare cases multiple others – will be secondary colonies. However,
not all warm-zone worlds are suitable as mainworlds. Hell worlds with
an extremely hostile environment are too expensive or sometimes just
plain impossible to colonize. Some hell worlds seem quite inviting, only
to hide some deadly secret not apparent in an orbital survey. Examples
include changeable conditions or extremely dangerous local wildlife or
plant species.
```

```
Other worlds in the warm zone may be unsuitable for a lack of resources
or may have been passed over for colonization because they did not suit
the needs of those wanting to exploit the system. For example, if a system
was colonized for mineral extraction purposes, it would make more sense
to set-up a major colony at the best starport location or most resource-
rich world in the system. An entirely habitable world might be passed
over as uneconomic or settled by a few farmers to act as a breadbasket
for the industry and extraction operations going on elsewhere.
```

```
However, as a rule, if a world is located in the warm zone and is not the
mainworld, there is usually a good reason why people do not want or
cannot afford to live there. Corrosive atmospheres, lack of useable land,
violent tectonics and all manner of other natural reasons could make a
warm-zone world a bad prospect.
```

### 85

Rockball Worlds
The majority of outsystem worlds are rockballs, with no atmosphere or
only a trace of one. Such worlds are highly unlikely to have life of any
sort if there is no water or gas to support respiration or its equivalent.
Rockballs vary in size and character; some are highly volcanic or have
significant mineral deposits; others are simply lumps of rock orbiting a
star. A rockball may have water locked up as ice or in deep underground
cisterns, which make it a little easer to colonize but otherwise such worlds
are as uninviting as they are common.

Rockball worlds have no protection against micrometeorites and are
usually pocked with large craters from more significant impacts. It is
common to build structures in natural canyons or close to crater walls in
order to obtain protection or build the majority of a facility underground.
However, the latter can be expensive and is typical only of permanent
settlements. Mining camps that will be moved eventually tend to be
erected where convenient to reach mineral or water deposits.

As a rule of thumb, for a rockball world to be inhabited there has to
be a reason to build a community there. Supporting people in such an
environment is very expensive, so unless there are scientific, political or
economic gains to be made, those seeking a new home will look to at
least marginally habitable worlds instead. The Referee should bear this in
mind when setting up a rockball community and have a plausible reason

### 86

```
in mind. Isolationism and political freedom are perfectly acceptable
rationales for such a settlement but funding to build the colony and keep
it viable has to come from somewhere. This can mean a settlement on a
rockball might have an interesting backstory or be in the throes of making
difficult decisions about how to preserve independence.
```

```
Iceballs
By convention an outsystem world with more than a trace of atmosphere is
often referred to as an iceball rather than rockball. The distinction is fuzzy
around the edges but is useful to Travellers in many ways. An iceball will
not have a breathable atmosphere – temperature conditions alone would
make support equipment necessary even if an oxygen/nitrogen mix were
somehow present – but the presence of an atmosphere provides at least
some protection from micrometeorites and will allow useful gases to be
extracted. Many exotic gas mixes found on iceball worlds contain oxygen
and hydrogen, allowing air and water to be processed out of them. This
in turn makes supporting a colony or installation much easier.
```

```
Iceball worlds present challenges of their own, however. The
atmosphere could be of an actively dangerous type and even if it is not,
the interface between installation and the outside will be more complex.
On a rockball, all that is necessary is to seal the inner atmosphere
inside; an iceball requires flushing airlocks of potentially toxic gases
and possibly decontamination of suits and equipment that have been
outside. Although air and water can be obtained from the outside
environment, some of this has to be used to protect the installation
from the effects of exterior conditions.
```

```
Super-Earths
Super-Earths are terrestrial (rocky) planets that are much larger than
Earth. They cannot occur in the standard mainworld generation system,
largely because a planet of this size makes a very poor prospect for
settlement even if it has the right temperature and atmospheric conditions.
If a super-earth is desired or indicated by random determination, its Size
code can be noted as S. Diameter can be determined on a roll of 1D+
multiplied by 1,600km, giving a maximum of 28,800km. Larger planets
are possible and are sometimes termed super-earths but are more
commonly considered miniature gas giants rather than terrestrial planets
as their composition tends to be more gaseous as size increases.
```

```
Surface gravity on a solid super-earth is likely to be in the 1.5g-1.8g
range and conditions extreme. Most will have an extremely dense
exotic atmosphere. It is possible for humans to live and work in such
an environment but equipment to support even the simplest activity is
expensive. Super-earths are thus unlikely to be permanently settled.

## GAZELLE CLOSE ESCORT

The Gazelle-class Close Escort is a ubiquitous workhorse of the Imperial
Navy and also in service with a number of private concerns as a pirate
hunter, escort-for-hire and route-protector. The following information is
generally available from any data terminal.

## GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS

Imperial Navy doctrine calls for large ships to be accompanied by well-
armed, small fighting craft capable of engaging the enemy at long range,
before they can approach the principal ships in a task force or convoy.
These small ships may be fighter craft carried by the larger vessels or
independent close escort vessels. Thousands of close escorts of various
types have been built in the past several centuries and hundreds have
been built in the Gazelle class.

## ENTRY POINTS

Gazelle class ships have several points of entry. Normal points are the
forward airlock, the gig hatch and the ceiling hatch adjacent to the bridge.
Unusual points of entry include maintenance panels on the drive modules,
access panels on both the barbettes and the sensor scanner domes on
the nose of the ship, which requires the domes be dismounted or broken
into. In addition, the triple laser turrets each have access panels on their
rear faces but these do not lead into the ship interior.

### 88

```
Both the gig hatch and the ceiling hatch are crouch locks; small air locks
with double hatches or doors mounted very close together. Ordinarily,
such passages are used for mating ships and direct passage between
them. They may be used for direct access to vacuum without evacuating
an entire area.
```

```
SHIP INTERIOR (VARIANT)
The interior of the ship is divided into a lower deck level, upper deck
level, two barbettes and a gig.
```

```
Lower Deck Level
The lower deck level is predominantly crew quarters and cargo hold.
```

1. Avionics Section containing deep radar, communications equipment,
    scanners and detectors.
2. Connecting Corridor with light and power consumption recorders.
3. Crew Stateroom for one gunner and one drive room technician.
4. Crew Stateroom for one gunner and one drive room technician.
5. Crew Stateroom for one gig pilot and one drive room technician.
6. Crew Stateroom for two gunners, one of whom is the chief gunner.
7. Common Room for crew members, generally used for off duty or for
    training classes.
8. Cargo Hold. Interior includes shelving and storage bins and is generally
    devoted to food and supply storage. The long narrow portion contains a
    dumbwaiter to the galley above.
9. Passage. This area allows activity for gig docking and personnel transfer.
10. Jump Drive Room.
11. Port Drive Module with one power plant and one maneuver drive.
12. Starboard Drive Module, with one power plant and one maneuver drive.
13. Triple Laser Beam Turret with interior position for gunner.
14. Triple Laser Beam Turret with interior position for gunner.
15. Ventral Barbette located forward and accessed from hatch at location 2.
16. Port Vent Maintenance Area to allow cleaning and maintenance for the
    power plant discharge vents. Accessible from inside or from outside.
17. Starboard Vent Maintenance Area. Similar to location 16.

## Gig docking

### 90

```
Upper Deck Level
The upper deck level contains the bridge, officers’ quarters, the galley
and sickbay.
```

18. Corridor allowing access to, and operation of, the port drive module.
19. Corridor allowing operation of the starboard drive module.
20. Port Nuclear Damper.
21. Starboard Nuclear Damper.
22. Corridor allowing access to, and operation of, the jump drive.
23. Corridor allowing access to, and operation of, the jump drive.
24. Ward Room for meals and leisure.
25. Galley for meal preparation.
26. Sick Bay.
27. Officer’s Lounge for the privacy of officers in their leisure time.
28. Command Pilot’s Stateroom.
29. Navigator’s Stateroom
30. Chief Engineer’s Stateroom.
31. Medic’s Stateroom.
32. Model/30 Computer Room.
33. Air Lock.
34. Ship’s Locker.
35. Bridge with acceleration couches for command pilot and navigator.
36. Forward Avionics Area.
37. Dorsal Barbette with access via the ceiling hatch in location 24.

### 92

```
The Gig
The gig serves as a lifeboat for the ship and access to world surfaces.
```

38. Corridor within the gig.
39. Bridge with acceleration couches for pilot and gunner.
40. Drive Room.
41. Air Lock. Note that the hatches open up into the ship and down for
    exit when on a surface.
42 - 46. Low Passage Berths. These berths can be used by conscious
    passengers, one per berth or as low passage berths with two
    person in each.

```
Liquid Hydrogen Tanks
The two longitudinal fuel tanks of the Gazelle are engineered to be
droppable in extreme circumstances. The ship has high capacity
accumulators in its jump drive and can completely burn its fuel prior to
jump, storing the energy while the tanks are then jettisoned. The decrease
in tonnage for the ship results in greater efficiency and the ship can jump
farther. Additional fuel tankage within the ship allows maneuver but the
tanks must be replaced before the ship can again jump.
```

```
Minimum Crew
Although the ship has a crew of 12, it is possible for it to function with fewer
personnel. Minimum crew is four; a pilot (who doubles as astrogator), a
chief (doubling as medic) and two engineers, who may also function as
gunners. Someone aboard must be capable of operating the gig. In the
face of crew casualties, the ship can operate with a crew of two – pilot
and engineer – long enough to limp away from a conflict zone.

## THE FLORIAN LEAGUE

```
When the Ancients departed from the galactic scene 250,000 years
ago, they left the remnants of their advanced civilization on hundreds of
worlds. High-tech ruins, strange artefacts and disconnected Droyne and
Chirper societies lay scattered throughout Charted Space. Perhaps most
fascinating of all are the dozens of uplifted and genetically engineered
strains of Humaniti and other species they left behind.
```

```
Most human subspecies were derived from Terran stock, creating
the Vilani and Zhodani. However, there is one strain that appears to
be unique among them. The Floriani are essentially an entirely new
species created by using the human genome as a template with several
notable changes.
```

```
The dimorphic homo sapiens floriansis consists of the Barnai, small and
physically weak but gifted with a superior intellect, and the Feskal, large,
strong and highly adaptable. They are so different in size and appearance
that one might think they came from two different genera, yet scientific
studies have shown the two share over 99% of the same DNA.
```

## PHYSIOLOGY

```
Barnai and Feskal physiques are quite different from each other but one
trait they share is number of digits; Floriani hands have three fingers and
an opposable thumb. They also have four digits on their feet.
```

```
The average Barnai is 150 centimetres tall and weighs 35kg. Barnai have
small frames and enormous heads containing their prodigious brains.
Their bone composition and density is identical to that of homo sapiens
but the skeletal system is compact and more economically distributed
within a smaller trunk. Barnai skin is hairless and of light complexion. The
Barnai lack much in the way of athleticism and physical activity is limited
to what is absolutely necessary. The subspecies is not known to engage
in excessive consumption of food or drink, making obesity extremely
rare. Having become accustomed to the assistance of the Feskals, they
do little that requires exertion.
```

```
The Barnai seem to have been designed with a ‘one size fits all’
approach. Barnai are sterile and have only one androgynous gender.
They are grown from the bioengineering vats of their homeworld and
while they have vestigial sexual organs, perhaps an oversight by their
designers, the Barnai do not reproduce sexually. There is little variation
in their features and characteristics. Indeed, it is often difficult to tell
them apart, which can cause awkward moments when members of other
species fail to distinguish one Barnai from another. The Barnai are highly
```

### 95

vulnerable in dangerous or challenging environments but that is where
their enormous cohorts, the Feskals, come into the picture.

Feskals average 2 metres in height and typically weigh 110kg or more.
Feskals have massive frames with immense musculature, particularly in
the shoulders, upper back and upper legs. Their frames appear top-heavy
but are exceedingly well balanced. The Feskal brow protrudes over deep-
set eyes, providing natural protection from intense light and dust.

The Feskal are highly adaptable to a wide range of environments. For
example, Feskal who live on frigid worlds grow copious amounts of body
hair to provide warmth and protection from the cold, while those on hot
or desert worlds grow no hair at all and have adaptive thermal systems
to help exhaust excess heat. In addition, Feskals are equally comfortable
and nimble on both small planets and massive ‘super earths’.

```
Feskal
```

```
Barnai
```

### 96

```
Feskals can perform great feats of strength and endure extreme levels
of physical hardship. Their brain size and complexity is typical for a
human but their cerebrums, where the majority of the reasoning centres
are present, have fewer neural pathways and less variation between the
two hemispheres. Unlike a typical human brain, Feskal hemispheres
are laterally oriented so the right controls the right side of the body
and the left controls the left. The lack of contralateral organization is
attributed to their inability to think creatively, which seems to serve
them sufficiently considering they rely on the Barnai to do most of their
decision making anyway.
```

```
Feskals, like their Barnai masters, were initially manufactured on Floria
and have asexual, if seemingly masculine, traits. However, isolated
Feskal populations have shown the ability to develop male and female
sex organs and exhibit fecundity when the survival of a population is
at stake. For examples of this, consider the subterranean population
on Trossachs, the lost colony on Vorn, and the feral population on the
Hierate world of Ouiyloi. All three populations spontaneously developed
the ability to reproduce when cut off from Floria.
```

```
There is some dispute among xenopaleontologists about whether or not
Feskals were developed on low-gravity Floria. Imperial scientists from the
research station on Dostoevsky have postulated that while the common
genome of the two Florian subspecies was manufactured on Floria, the
nascent Feskal must have been taken to Tanar for further development.
The fossil record on Tanar seems to substantiate this but the theory has
yet to be subjected to rigorous testing.
```

```
A BRIEF HISTORY
The Floriani experience was different from that of other humans
uplifted by the Ancients. Most were left with virtually nothing and had
to rebuild their civilizations from scratch but the Ancient machines
on Floria were left largely intact, enabling them to maintain a high-
technology society. The Floriani had only a rudimentary understanding
of how the machines worked but tended to them as best they could.
Many broke down over the eons, forcing the Floriani to reinvent such
things as agriculture and industry.
```

```
Their first contact with offworlders was with the Sindalians who engaged
in trade with the Florians for decades before their own empire began
its fateful decline. A few centuries later the Floriani encountered the
Aslan, whose reach extended to Floria in -170. The Aslan had, by this
time, seen many Ancients ruins and were amazed by what they found
on Floria. As ihatei, the Aslan began to create permanent habitations
on the Florian homeworld but were quickly rebuffed. The conflict was
a bloodbath, taking the lives of hundreds of Feskals and killing nearly
every Aslan who took part in the expedition. The survivors returned to
the trans-rift colonies with the knowledge that dangerous human foes
were to coreward.
```

### 97

After allegedly discovering jump-drive technology from crashed Aslan
starships, the Floriani began to cautiously reach out to neighboring
star systems where they established colonies. More than three centuries
passed before the Floriani engaged in meaningful contact with outsiders.
An independent trade mission from the Imperium reached them in 171
and the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service made contact in 185. The
Floriani initially welcomed the traders but closed their doors to them in
200 after being contacted by the Zhodani on their spinward frontier.

As they cautiously branched out to more star systems, the Floriani
discovered the remnants of Terran and Sindalian colonies and peacefully
incorporated them into their society, treating them as they would Feskals.
Many of these populations persist to the present day, forming subcultures
that exhibit aspects of their Terran origins mixed with the conservative
and introspective ways of the Florians.

The task of managing their growing empire became more challenging
over time and in 506 they established the Florian League, designating
the Council of the Stars to govern it. Shortly thereafter, the Florians cut
off trade with the Zhodani and opened it once again with the Imperium.
At some point in the late 900s, the Florian League began to recognize
the threat posed by the Aslan, who were now encroaching upon their
rimward border. The Floriani built defensive structures and starship fleets
in an effort to create a buffer zone for their homeworld.

The Florians have fought several wars with the Aslan, almost all of which
have been caused by Aslan aggression. The only wars started by the
Florians have been to regain lost territory. Currently they find themselves
in a period of retrenchment, building up defences on their shared border
with the Hierate and engaging in trade with the Imperium through the
interface world of Yggdrasil.

CULTURE AND PSYCHOLOGY

Despite the lack of physical variation among the Barnai, they exhibit
a great deal of independence and creativity, perhaps too much given
the haphazard and slapdash methods they employ to solve problems.
Groups of Barnai often engage in spirited debates about how to
address one issue or another. When the Floriani encounter a problem,
they investigate it, meticulously collect evidence and then debate it,
sometimes ad nauseam, until a viable solution appears. This intellectual
method of tackling problems seems to have been programmed into the
Barnai, perhaps intended to serve as capable assistants to the Ancients.

Despite the fact that they possess an interstellar empire, the Floriani
completely lack interest in the act of empire building. Everything they
do is ultimately to protect and preserve their homeworld, an adaptation
doubtless programmed into them by the Ancients. Despite the unlikelihood
that the Ancients will ever return, the Floriani trudge on, caring for the

technological wonders they inherited as if they might one day resume
the work they were designed to do. They man the oars of a ship that has
lost its captain.

Given over to the fulfilment of duty, Florians lead lives wonderfully bereft
of ambition but full of purpose. Just what that purpose might be is a
great mystery but this is of little importance to them. They are completely
and unequivocally engaged in the industry of securing their homeworld
and rarely notice the random observations and judgments of outsiders.
Had they the capacity for it, the Florians might even pity offworlders,
consumed as they are by a void of true purpose in their lives.

Innovation is lacking in the Florian League but this is of no more
consequence to them than the loss of a vestigial organ or unneeded fifth
digit on their hands. The League always seems to obtain what it needs
and when it needs it from the Ancients machines on Floria.

GOVERNMENT AND LAW

Florian government is conducted by councils comprised of Barnai officials
who are elected by lottery. If selected, a Barnai serves for a term of four
years at the local, planetary or League level. Governing a star-spanning
polity is a complex business and elected Barnai spend the majority of their
terms merely learning the job. Barnai councillors have only just acquired
the qualifications to govern by the end of their brief tenure. The true task
of governing is performed by ex-councillors constantly called upon to
advise those Barnai in governmental service. It is an odd arrangement
but has enabled them to both protect their homeworld and expand their
reach without ever truly meaning to do so.

The transient nature of Floriani government often results in the partial
completion of major projects. By the time government service has
ended for one Floriani, most projects they may have fostered have not
been brought to fruition. The next wave of councillors is then elected
and a completely new slew of policies is implemented. The result is
a patchwork of partially completed projects, few of which address the
problem or challenge they were meant to handle. Look no further than the
ecological disaster on Trossachs for an example of bad governance. The
Council of the Stars agonises over impending disaster on the planet but
the transitory nature of Florian government lacks the ability to effectively
manage it. As soon as one solution has begun to be implemented, a
council is retired and a new one brought on board with its own ideas.

Law Levels are low on Floriani worlds with few exceptions. Barnai and
Feskal were designed to work together and there is little in the way of
social strife among them. Disputes are almost universally settled without
involving litigation but when a dispute occurs that must be settled in an
official manner, a judge and jury of five investigate the claim to determine
if what was done constitutes a crime. The Floriani have very loose notions

### 100

```
of the concepts of crime and punishment, instead focussing on the act
itself to determine if it was justified.
```

```
THE FLORIAN TRIAD
The Florian League currently consists of 34 star systems. Three of
those systems are of exceedingly great importance: Floria, Trossachs
and Vadada.
```

```
Most empires are built upon solid foundations and careful planning. Well-
defended capitals are surrounded by strategically placed resources,
industrial centres and military bases. Fortresses and fleets defend the
frontiers. Not so with the Florian League.
```

```
As the League began to expand and Floria’s bioengineering facilities
created ever more Floriani, the Council of the Stars recognized the
overwhelming need for two things; industrial goods and defence.
```

```
Trossachs became the industrial engine of the Florian League where
over 90 percent of its basic goods are manufactured and disseminated
among the other worlds. Vadada, located precariously on the League’s
periphery, became its primary military base and shipyard. Unfortunately,
```

**VADADA AND ITS MOON, JARNO**

### 101

both Trossachs and Vadada have been threatened time and again by
Florian incompetence. The impending ecological collapse of Trossachs
could very well threaten the League’s ability to provide for the worlds of
its empire and Vadada has historically found itself constantly under siege
from the Hierate and Glorious Empire.

As vulnerable as the triad appears to be, it has withstood the test of time.
Whenever one member of the triad is threatened, the Florians seem to
be able to pull some sort of deus ex machina from the Ancients machines
to save them from utter annihilation.

STARSHIPS

Florian starships are highly advanced, achieving TL14 with many TL15
prototypes in service. Their spacecraft are blocky utilitarian monstrosities,
most bristling with weaponry. Their naval ships are designed to fight
asymmetric wars by overwhelming enemies with force followed by orbital
bombardment, nuclear warfare or even biological attacks, if need be.

When entering a Florian star system, Travellers can expect to receive a
signal from a fast interceptor, essentially a high-speed system defence
boat with breaching tubes and forced linkage apparatuses. Travellers are
advised to establish communications with these ships quickly to ensure
no misunderstandings occur.

Merchant and other craft exhibit the same disregard for aesthetics.
They are completely devoid of comfort and elegance, and constructed
only for the task at hand. Traders have immense cargo holds and
few accoutrements for passengers. Scout ships are overloaded with
redundant sensory equipment and unnecessary armor and armament.

CHILDREN OF THE STARS

Created to assist the Ancients and left to their own devices, the Floriani
find themselves in a state of developmental stasis. They were gifted with
civilization and high technology by the Ancients but lack the capacity for
innovation to exploit the immense well of knowledge at their disposal.

Like children serving an absent paternal master, the Florians tend to their
worlds in a bumbling, naïve fashion overbuilding defences, wreaking
ecological disasters and engaging with their neighbors in stumbling,
awkward fashion. They move neither forward nor backward but do not
lack a common purpose. Barnai and Feskal work together amiably to
preserve and protect the homeworld that has fostered and protected
them for hundreds of thousands of years.

## GROUND VEHICLES

## SPLORABUG

```
The vehicle almost universally known as a Splorabug has a variety
of official designations. Variants on the concept are sold by several
companies seeking to dominate a particular segment of the market.
The Splorabug (Explorer Buggy) consists of a rectangular equipment
block with a bubble-like canopy on the front. This is pressurised and
can support a ‘shirtsleeves’ environment but has no airlock; personnel
commonly wear vacc suits with the helmet off to operate the vehicle and
‘button up’ to go outside.
```

```
The vehicle has an extensive sensor and electronics fit, which can be
tailored to various missions, but has virtually no cargo capability other than
tools and sample bags fastened to its many external racks and holders.
The fuel-cell Power Plant is designed for long journeys at slow speeds
over rough terrain, driving four large balloon-tyre wheels that can clamber
over surprisingly large obstructions. A Splorabug will float on water and
can propel itself – albeit very slowly – by the rotation of its wheels.
```

```
Perhaps the most attractive feature for many users is the heavy
protection a Splorabug offers against meteorites. It is well-armored all
round – capable of defeating heavy machinegun fire from any direction
```

- with particularly heavy armor on the upper surfaces. This makes the
Splorabug popular with prospectors and explorers operating on rockball
worlds. It is not uncommon to find examples with the second crew
position replaced by yet more electronics, sometimes specialist gadgets
invented for the purpose of finding a particular mineral or rock formation.

TALSON AUTOMOTIVE

```
‘CHALLENGER’ GROUND CAR
According to the rather aggressive marketing by Talson Automotive,
their Challenger ground car is intended to challenge the notion that grav
vehicles are better than ground. Marketed as a ‘prestige performance and
security’ vehicle, the Challenger is aimed at executives and celebrities
who value comfort as much as high speed and might someday have to
escape an assassination attempt... or who want everyone to think they
are important enough to worry about such things.
```

```
With a top speed of well over 700 kilometres per hour on a test track,
the Challenger is certainly quick. However, no amount of electronics will
permit a car to reach such speed on normal roads. Enthusiasts talk about
top speeds but what really matters is the ability to reach 200 kilometres
per hour within seconds of a standing start. The only way the Challenger
can do this is to use variant Smart Wheels. Rather than being optimised
for rough terrain, the wheels are designed to maintain traction and permit
braking, steering and acceleration under conditions that would send a
lesser vehicle careering off the road. Of course, at 200 kilometres per
hour an average city street might well be considered rough terrain...

The electronics fit includes a highly advanced auto-drive feature, which
is set at the factory to take over and save the vehicle if the driver exceeds
the limits of rationality. For an extra Cr25000 (and a signed waiver), the
manufactures will fit a cut-off that allows the user to manually disable the
auto-drive with an ostentatious flick of a finger. It should also be noted
that the purchase price includes around Cr100000 of cosmetic touches,
with additional options adding up to Cr250000 more. The entertainment
system and contents of the wet bar both come in at Cr50000 each...
and an upgrade package is of course available for those who consider
120-year-old Scotch to be a ‘base model’ feature.

## LATIEN HAULER SMALL FREIGHTER

```
The Latien Hauler is small by the standards of freighters but is the largest
ship many ports will ever see. Built on a boxy 2,000-ton hull, the standard
version is constructed at TL10 and license-built almost everywhere. With
2g acceleration and the capability to make two consecutive one-parsec
jumps, a Latien Hauler can reach most markets.
```

```
The Latien Hauler is aimed at a market niche somewhere between
bulk freighting and tramp-trading. It will often be encountered on a long
haul with several hundred tons of a single cargo type aboard plus an
assortment of small freight lots much like those found aboard a typical
subsidised merchant or free trader. It is capable of making planetary
landings and can service small ports that do not see many ships of this
size, although its handling characteristics in an atmosphere have been
described as being ‘like a pig on stilts’.
```

```
Hull form is rectangular, with a flared stern and rounded bow containing
the primary cargo airlock. The cargo hold is two decks high and runs
almost the length of the ship, with two additional cargo locks on the
flanks. Passenger accommodation is at the stern, with a dedicated
passenger airlock on the lowest level giving access to a reception and
common area. Each deck has eight passenger cabins. Where the lower
deck contains the main common area, the upper houses the medical bay
and a smaller common area normally used by the duty steward.
```

```
All crew and control areas are aft, in an additional partial deck protruding
above the line of the main hull. This area is accessed by an elevator/
lift shaft running from the lowest deck but requires crew identification
to access the command/crew area. The lift opens into the small crew
lounge, forward of which is the training room and bridge. Aft is a small
workshop area and the engineering chamber, containing the jump drive
and part of the ship’s power generating machinery. The rest of the power
plant is dispersed as two modules, along with the maneuver drive, on
the flanks of the main hull. Reaching these areas is rarely necessary
due to remote operations and automation; they are cramped and not
designed to be accessed on an ongoing basis.
```

```
The Latien Hauler is most definitely a cargo ship rather than passenger
carrier. The cabins are comfortable enough and there is adequate
common space but passengers are incidental to the ship’s main business.
Despite this, the ship has a decent medical bay, in keeping with its role as
a reputable cargo hauler forming part of a recognized shipping line. The
training facility is normally set-up for piloting or astrogation revision rather
```

### 107

than the more robust physical and combat training aboard mercenary
ships. Many a spacer started their career with on-the-job training aboard
a Latien Hauler and most shipping lines like to cross-train their personnel
or offer career development to assist retention.

It is typical for ships of this type to have a ‘flight’ crew of two pilot/bridge
personnel, an astrogator and a captain (who is often also the astrogator),
six engineering staff and a ‘deck’ crew of about half a dozen multi-skilled
personnel acting as stewards, medics and cargo-wranglers as needed,
in addition to carrying out maintenance and administrative tasks.

LATIEN HAULER Q-SHIP
The size and commonality of the Latien Hauler makes it ideal for
conversion to a Q-ship. Visually identical to the standard version until it
deploys its weaponry, the Q-ship retains all the equipment of the standard
model, with additional TL12 items installed in the cargo hold.
```

```
The vessel’s two batteries of fusion barbettes are located along its flanks
whilst 12 pulse laser turrets are mounted in pairs around the dorsal and
external surfaces of the maneuver drive compartments. All weapons
are in concealed pop-up mounts, including the fusion barbettes.
```

```
The Latien-Q has potent sucker-punch firepower but can be spotted
by a wary pirate. The additional power plant, if active, alters the ship’s
emissions; if it is not online this clue will be missed by hostiles but the
ship lacks power to fire all weapons until the plant is started.
```

```
The other way to spot a Latien-Q is to watch for passengers. No
additional accommodation is added during the conversion process, so
gunners must use the passenger cabins. A Latien Hauler that does not
take on passengers is by no means unusual but could be a clue that
there may be more to this ship than meets the eye. Cargo capacity is not
greatly reduced by incorporating the weaponry; a Latien-Q can still carry
over 1,000 tons of cargo, so its Q-ship role might not be immediately
apparent. Indeed, a Latien-Q may still be a viable commercial starship.

LATIEN HAULER GEM
The GEM-ship (Gunship-Equipped Merchant) comes and goes over
time. It is essentially an expedient conversion, adding the capability to
operate fighters or other small armed craft to a merchant vessel. Where
the Q-ship conceals weaponry, the GEM-ship advertises it in the hope
of deterring hostiles. GEM-ships are sometimes deployed as armed
merchant cruisers in wartime but are much more effective in peacetime
commerce protection. Since the vessel retains some cargo capability, it
can function as an armed transport although it will stand little chance if it
encounters a proper warship even a fraction of its size.

The Latien Hauler GEM-ship trades most of its cargo capacity for 400
tons of small craft hangars, accessed from the flanks of the ship. A range
of craft can be carried, depending upon the mission; it is common to
operate a mix of light fighters and pinnaces if the GEM-ship is engaged
in patrol or escort work. Alternatively, up to four 200-ton system defence
boats can be carried to their station or deployed as heavy gunships.
The hangar is configured so unused space can still be used for freight,
although this can make handling of both cargo and small craft awkward.

Likewise, there is no missile magazine; the ship’s cargo hold is used to
carry missile reloads. There is no protection for the bays or the reloads,
so a hit amidships, aft of the hangar area, risks blowing the whole ship
in two. Aft of the missile bays and remaining cargo space is a small
accommodation block for the small craft pilots. There is no additional
power plant, unlike the Q-ship version, so the Latien-GEM cannot
operate weapons whilst preparing to jump.

Although quite heavily armed, with a powerful missile armament and
complement of armed small craft, the Latien-GEM is still a cargo ship
and a very clumsy one at that. The terrestrial equivalent would be putting
a flight deck on an oil tanker – an apt analogy, given the shape and layout
of the basic Latien Hauler.

## ASHUSHUM

```
The ashushum, which roughly translates as ‘leather snake’ is a creature
native to Vland, which sheds tough skin that can be worked into leather
or a flatbread analogue. Its eggs have extremely well known nutritional
properties and preparation methods. The ashusum was one of the
earliest domesticated animals on Vland, its food and clothing products
well integrated into society before written history and serving as a model
for other efforts to make food from what resources were available.
Ashushum leather is the traditional material for a number of traditional
garments throughout former First Imperium space and is more available
than Terran cow leather in many sectors.
```

```
Ashushum change colour as they age, from a brilliant purple through blue,
green, yellow and eventually a dull red (centering on the near infrared),
moulting once every four months on average and living for about 30 moults.
An ashushum that can no longer moult grows within its skin until it crushes
itself to death, producing a distinct tough meat akin to
jerky, which is usually softened into a delicacy.
Ashushum eyes are sensitive to ultraviolet and
it is generally believed their colour change
helps ashushum identify potential
mates, looking for those not too bright
in ultraviolet but not completely dark
in that wavelength either. Older
ashushum shed tougher
skin, more usable as leather
and less edible. Some
breeds grow tough beads
on their tails that can be ground into
spice or fire-hardened to stud the
leather. Ashushum are not poisonous
but archaeology suggests they
once had venomous kin, apparently
exterminated as Vilani spread across
their world.

### 117

A common example of Vilani conservatism is that, while many other
domestic animals have been engineered and bred for higher utility, most
ahushum today have the exact same genome as those on pre-spaceflight
Vland, having never benefited from augmentation beyond selective
breeding. Some ashushum farms on Vland have been in continuous
operation, providing seed stock for numerous colonies, for over 10,000
years and are quite the sight to behold, with automated food distribution
and moult gathering machines poking out of several square kilometres
of ashushum pens, which look from a distance like writhing, slithering
ground. Many Solomani report a sensation of slight unease when first
beholding such an operation.

AUWOIL

The auwoil are small rodents that Aslan like to keep around to hunt. Fast
but dumb, they are easily tricked into enclosed spaces, around which
they run until they are caught or find a way out. This behaviour comes
from being bred to get euphoria from running. In zero-g environments
they will often ‘treadmill’ around a room, running around in circles so long
as their clawed toes can find footholds.

Auwoils use their large hind legs to almost fly over the ground, being
capable of horizontal leaps of six metres in rapid succession. This quick
gait compensates for their small size, allowing them to nearly outrun an
average adult Aslan.

Some Aslan ships carry tiny treadmills as a source of temporary
emergency power, the idea being to put auwails on them and get at
least several minutes of life support and
communications, potentially enough
for a rescue if the ship is disabled.
The amount of power generated
is minuscule enough that this
would be a desperate measure
but prideful male Aslans
cannot be bothered with such
details, assuming females
can make the numbers work.

EAUEAL
‘Eaueal’ translates from Trokh as ‘river gun’ and that is a fair summary
of the species. Some landowners within the Aslan Hierate view it as
traditional to create small streams to mark territory boundaries, if no
other landmarks are handy. Many of these streams host this imported eel
analogue. In theory, they eat any small animals attempting to cross from
one territory to another without permission (being incapable of language,
they never ask). Many get by in practice but said small animals are the
mainstay of adult eaueals’ diets even at some distance from the streams.

### 119

Freshly hatched young eaueals, and adults who can not find bigger prey,
dine on small insects, although mated eaueals with recently hatched
offspring will see the mother guarding the offspring while the father
brings back fresh kills.

The most notable feature of eaueals is their 12 high pressure water
chambers, which can be discharged rapidly to produce high velocity
bolts of water, capable of hitting with the force of a low-grade air rifle.
These chambers are present from birth but capable of much less range
and power in juveniles. The region of the throat above these chambers is
reinforced, shaping the bolts to allow for impressively long range attacks
for a natural weapon (although by no means record setting). They can
be recharged in water, at a rate of one per round. While a substantial
threat to small, weak, unarmored animals, they are of little danger to
sufficiently armored Aslan hunters or to those who fire from further than
the eaueals can reach.

Attacking from a distance is best done with thermal or other enhanced
vision, as eaueals can change their skin coloration to sneak up on their
favoured prey. They are also adept at using water to hide their presence,
particularly fond of digging up dirt to hide their presence when they think
some larger predator (such as an Aslan) is nearby. Ironically, trained
hunters know the sudden appearance of these muddy clouds in the water
is a sign an eaueal may be present, if not exactly where. Analogies have
been made to electronic warfare giving away the presence of previously
undetected vehicles, where the crew feared they were already detected.
Eaueals are air-breathing amphibians. Varieties have been bred that can
handle thin, dense and most varieties of tainted atmospheres. Inevitably,
eaueals roam whatever water sources their streams are connected
to, colonising them over time. While they are freshwater creatures, ill
adapted to saltwater oceans, they have short fin-like legs that allow a
decent overland speed. They must keep their skin moist, usually only
able to spend three to six hours out of water depending on humidity,
although one eaueal was found to have spent dozens of hours aloft in a
hurricane and suffering no ill effects, apparently having hunted and fed
while aloft. On most worlds where they are present, Aslan are their main
predators; while eaueals do not trigger the same instincts as auwoils,
their larger size and increased danger can still make for satisfying hunts,
especially for those who use only dewclaws when seeking eaueals.

Eaueals use Athletics (dexterity), rather than Gun Combat (archaic), to
fire their water bolts.

## 120

# EYEWING

```
Eyewings are genetically engineered sentries that change their feather
colour to blend with the sky when viewed from below or with the ground
(or clouds) when viewed from above. They have sharp enough senses
to avoid incoming grav craft or spacecraft, are acclimated to a particular
installation (most often a starport) and squawk in radio frequencies when
they see something unfamiliar, which alerts security to investigate an
area. If intruders shoot the bird they give away their hostile intent and,
more importantly, position. They can expect an immediate response if
any armed ship allied to the installation is in line of sight, assuming they
are not close to vital infrastructure.
```

```
Eyewings will also squawk, although in a louder and more frequent pitch,
if they witness some major calamity such as an earthquake or spaceship
crashing into a starport. On some colony worlds this is the only early
warning system, buying colonists a few precious seconds to brace or
summon help from far flung emergency services.
```

```
By most accounts, the eyewing was engineered to justify the development
of DNA that could create an organic radio transceiver; a solution looking
for a problem. Natural variations in length and strength meant organisms
would broadcast in inconsistent wavelengths (much inferior to cybernetic
implants), with all the lack of formality and training of any beast, meaning
use was confined to what were frontier worlds at the time.
As these worlds grew, some eventually outlawed them
(using their radio speech to hunt and exterminate),
while others cordoned off the portion of radio
spectrum that eyewings use. Some of
these latter worlds have bred and
trained songbird variants,
producing symphonies
only audible via
radio.

# GIANT SILKMAKER

These cat-sized spiders are the source of certain brands of cloth armor,
as well as less durable textiles and ornaments. They have diverged
heavily from their ancestors, no longer possessing venom and exclusively
herbivorous. Bred for zero-g environments, they fare poorly in even 0.1g
and will not survive long on any world of Size 2+ or in a spaceship that
does not have zero-g compartments available. Most spacecraft are too
small to have more than one gravity aboard, meaning these creatures
must be shipped in low berths.

Porcupine-like spines on their backs catch and weave the silk they produce.
Pheromone trails can alter the pattern of quills and lead the silkmakers
along paths, doing most of the work to create garments, especially when
multiple silkmakers are coordinated. While at work, the silk trailing behind
a silkmaker often looks like a miniature scarf until the end result begins
to take shape. Their silk is naturally white but dyes in their food will pass
through their digestive systems and colour the silk. Certain families of
silkmakers weave in well-known patterns, which become prized then passé
then prized again in difficult to predict cycles. Larger garment makers keep
multiple families, stockpiling the output of the less popular for decades,
then making a fortune when they are once more in style.

If left unguided (such as in an abandoned but functional space station), they
tend to form nests and webs as they revert to simple survival and breeding.
If there are no predators aboard, they will eat themselves to extinction,
resulting in a tangled mess for any subsequent explorers to slice through.
It is more often the case that they will serve as food for a small predator
population, sustaining carnivores and omnivores capable of hunting and
slaying unarmored Travellers. Some survival guides thus call out the
existence of silkmakers on abandoned space stations as a warning sign.

# HORSE

```
Most sophont races have a native equivalent but the Rule of Man
thoroughly established the horse’s iconic status throughout much of
Charted Space. When the Third Imperium finally rose thousands of
years later, horses were still the most commonly used riding animal.
Millennia of development of the saddle have not changed the basic
concept. Countless varieties have been bred, adapted to local
circumstances on thousands of worlds; commonly available horses can
breathe the air of any world with atmosphere codes two through nine.
```

```
Some worlds that forbid high technology, require travellers to ride
horses (or walk) if they go beyond the starport. Every class D or higher
downport on such a world has horses for lease – Cr100 to Cr1000 per
day, higher prices where rentals are less common or supply is scarce,
sometimes requiring D3 weeks’ lease as a deposit and refunding any
unused deposit upon return. The image of a veteran pilot, master of
vehicles from g/bikes to the largest capital ships but clueless about
animals and needing to ride (often sidesaddle) with someone who can
handle a horse, has been iconic in popular media since the Solomani
first encountered the Vilani. When vehicular stats prove useful,
a horse can be treated as a TL 0 open light walker vehicle with a
maximum speed of Slow and cruising speed of Very Slow, maximum
speed Range of 90 and cruising speed Range of 120 (a daily limit
of endurance that can be reached in a few hours, assuming a breed
tailored for long distance travel), the ATV trait (DM+2 to negotiate
rough terrain, cancelling the usual DM-2) and uses Animals (handling)
to instead of Drive. A horse is not actually a vehicle and may
not have vehicular components mounted beyond
riders and cargo.

Where horses are required and vehicles forbidden, there will usually
be a vendor in a nearby system (or elsewhere in the same system)
providing equine robots with very good biomimetics (TL 10+ and
Cr120000, with stats equal to a horse but triple the Range as a robot
does not tire) and a tiny fuel processor (to refuel from water, taking
six hours): if the world truly forbids high technology, that includes
forbidding the scanners necessary to tell the difference. Given the
relatively high cost, this is usually about ornery pride rather than
customization, familiarity and the other typically stated advantages.
Citizens who suspect this cheating will sometimes claim it is customary
to give a stranger’s horse a friendly pat or look in the horse’s mouth,
as an excuse to check for motors instead of muscles under the skin,
which results in a contest between the examiner’s Animals (veterinary)
(INT) and the robot’s maker’s Deception (INT); an advanced skin
package (changing the cost to Cr150000) gives the maker DM+ equal
to the TL the robot was made at. Against technological sensors, this is
Electronics (sensors) (INT) versus Deception (INT) and the advanced
skin, if present and of a higher TL than the sensor, gives DM+ equal
to the robot’s TL minus the sensor’s.

# LIVING REFINERY

A silicon-based lifeform similar to a fungal mat, engineered by one of
the subject races of the Hive Federation, which floats – usually under
direction – from asteroid to asteroid, eating just the stony parts, ejecting
ore and ice, living off sunlight for energy and stone for nutrition. Entire
cultures of sophonts are based on living refineries, living on docked
spaceships (occasionally briefly leaving to tug more asteroids into their
host’s path) until enough ice and/or ore has been accumulated, then
heading to a nearby world to trade the goods for manufactured wares
(tens or hundreds of thousands of tons of ore, for a new spaceship to
house the clan’s expanded population, is common).

Living refineries require a certain minimum light intensity, meaning they
cannot survive in the outer reaches of a solar system without artificial
light. It is easy to construct and maintain a fusion-powered light source
to sustain a living refinery but in most cases their riding clans prefer to
stay in the inner system.
```

```
Living refineries usually use their ingested rocks to grow but maintain
a reserve mass to eject for thrust, although they can barely get from
planetary orbit to a satellite or (via longer, low energy transfer orbits)
from asteroid to asteroid in a typical belt. When a living refinery grows
large enough, it can be cut to make two smaller creatures, with any
sophont clan aboard likewise dividing. Alternately, a living refinery
can be put in shade from the sun for a while, killing it but making the
equivalent of a spaceship’s planetoid hull in whatever shape the living
refinery was folded into as it died.
```

```
Planetoid hulled ships are strongly cautioned to stay away from these
creatures, as they will consume said hulls just like any asteroid.
Damage varies by the amount of surface area in contact with the living
refinery but usually one percent of the ship’s maximum Hull per combat
round, ignoring Armor. Ships with an outer skin made of metal (which
is most ships) are safe.

# PSIBEE

```
A telepathic/group mind bee swarm, originally developed 693–698 by a
joint Third Imperium/Zhodani Consulate group, exterminated within the
Third Imperium during the Psionics Suppressions (800–820). The queen
grows large enough to function as a mobile central hive, while retaining
her ability to fly. Psibees are used as pollinators on worlds with psions,
where the queens can be psionically controlled. One variant known as a
‘magbee’ is magnetoreceptive, so as to be also
controllable via magnets but
retain their telepathy.

Queens are usually sessile, serving as a base around which honeycombs
are constructed. The queen (with the only developed stomach in
the swarm) digests all pollen and nectar brought by the workers and
secrets it as wax (which the workers fashion into honeycombs around
the queen), larvae (which all become workers, unlike Terran bees) and
honey (the only thing the larvae and workers actually eat). They can
be directed to abandon honeycombs and move to another location to
facilitate harvesting but care must be taken to only move the hive when
it is strong. Creating new queens is done only on command; the queen
will secrete a measure of royal jelly, triggering a larva to grow rapidly, up
to half as large as the existing queen before growing wings and leaving,
taking a portion of the swarm.

Psibees are also intended for guerrilla defence of an invaded planet.
Unsealed armor offers no protection from their stings. The queen can
hide nearby in full cover, attacking with a seemingly endless supply of
workers. Whoever is controlling the queen must be able to see the target
but this can be via camera. If the queen is killed, the workers disperse then
starve in a few hours unless they find another psibee queen to take them
in, such as one whose workers have been depleted fighting the invaders.

# RAMUMI

Ramumis, also known as ‘Vilani rats’, are small furred egg layers found
throughout coreward Imperial space. Their eggs are the core ingredient
in many Vilani dishes, suggesting they are from Vland but their ancestry
is disputed. There are no records of ramumis on Vland prior to their
discovery of the jump drive, although this was about 10,000 years ago
so absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

They appear to have been a favourite of the Vlani
shugilii, in the caste’s role as food preparers
and eventually preservers of tradition. At
some point training them to sing
was adopted as a tradition;
ramumi-sung hymns were
composed to mark the Ziru
Sirka’s founding, a few
of which were sung for
Cleon I upon the founding

of the Third Imperium. Ramumis bred for song are slimmer, longer lived,
more colourful, slightly more intelligent and less frequently laying than
ramumis bred for egg production. Their high pitched tonal squeaking is
known on worlds from Cruicis Margin to Fulani, from Gashikan (where
certain groups have them sing as part of ceremonially executing Vargr)
to Banners (where they are traditionally hidden from Aslan guests). Meat
from singing ramumi (readily discernible by their thinner and leaner
texture) is outlawed on many Vilani worlds, which in almost every case
has resulted in a black market. There have been underworld chefs who
prided themselves on making feasts for their organizations featuring this
ingredient. Some criminal groups use ramumi meat heists as training
runs for new members, recording the heists to provide blackmail to
secure said members’ loyalty.
```

```
Ramumis are also, according to legend, favoured assassination tools
in certain circles; train one to seek out a target’s scent, force feed it
explosives, let it scamper where few think it a serious threat and
detonate via radio when it perches on the target’s shoulder. Damage is
equal to a grenade (type depending on the choice of explosive, usually
frag), ignoring the target’s armor unless the target is wearing something
covering the full body (specifically, the neck).
```

# SHIP’S CAT

```
Terran cats have been aboard ships since before the Solomani
discovered jump drive but ship’s cats are specifically bred for life aboard
ship. They can sense pressure differentials and electric fields, which can
help find problems in ship systems and in the event of depressurization
will instinctively seek out pressurised areas or enter rescue balls (which
they sometimes inhabit for no apparent purpose beyond fun). Certain
breeds can survive a short time in vacuum (so long as they are in
contact with a surface to draw heat from) and in distress are able to
operate simple airlock controls to get back inside (they never do this
when in normal atmosphere). Many ship’s cats will refuse to exit the
ship on all but standard atmosphere worlds (or in standard pressure
regions of thin or dense atmosphere worlds) but have natural filters for
tainted atmospheres. They have been thoroughly bred and engineered
to not chew on wires or otherwise ruin sensitive systems and become
temporarily infertile while in jumpspace, remaining so for several days
after breakout. Most breeds can distinguish ship’s crew from passengers
and will stay away from the latter if they seem to be the type who would
not appreciate cats.
```

```
Ship’s cats are kept for companionship and to hunt vermin that get on
board. This latter trait endears them to Hivers, who use them as convenient
on-board predators to hunt the grubs that Hivers shed. Some Vargr keep
ship’s cats for their company, especially lowborn Vargr without many
friends. Aslan instinctively see ship’s cats as competitors for the same
prey and so rarely keep them. K’kree see ship’s cats as a symbol of all
that is wrong with meat-eating aliens. Ship’s cats on Droyne ships are
```

## 127

exceptionally well cared for and some crews use them as divinatory aids
to suggest future ventures, essentially using the ship’s cat as captain.

Some breeds, developed in the Third Imperium before the Psionics
Suppressions, are psionic, favouring teleportation the way sophonts favour
telepathy. These add the Psionic (9) trait and Teleportation 2 skill, and rarely
teleport with equipment; collars are left behind but implanted transponders
(standard for ship’s cats, to make sure they are aboard when it is time
to leave port) will teleport. They are known for teleporting through walls
(never into vacuum and are able to escape sudden depressurization of a
compartment this way), disappearing around corners or behind furniture
and generally going anywhere in a ship they want to. There is many a
tale of a depressed spacer, locked inside their stateroom and refusing all
company, whose ship’s cat would not take no for an answer and cuddled
the spacer until suicidal thoughts went away. If using the Sanity rules from
the Traveller Companion, the daily attentions of a friendly ship’s cat count
towards establishing a ‘safe and supportive’ environment for recovering
Sanity even if there is no one else to be supportive.

# ZIAVBRO

```
Terra does not have a monopoly on the basic concept of a furred four-
legged domesticated companion animal. The ziavbro is an example
native to Zhodane. Most breeds are waist-high to a Zhodani as adults,
easily capable of carrying a human child. They are also psionic, having
been bred to very high levels of talent. While they have no language as
sophonts know it, they can empathise, as well as channel psi power to
boost their bodies when danger is near. Compared to Terran dogs, they
have a single extra mid-forehead eye tuned to the infrared, which helps
them spot hidden living creatures (or in modern times, hidden power
sources, such as powered armor in cover).
```

```
In ancient times they were used as hunters, guardians and herders,
much like animals on countless worlds. They still fill that role on lower
tech worlds but are more often seen as intimacy surrogates, bonding with
someone deprived of family. They are also frequently used in elder and
baby care, tending to charges unable to speak on their own. Ziavbros
who served on exploration, military or police duties, where their handlers
died in action, often return to their handler’s family where they serve as
protector and caretaker in place of their missing person.
