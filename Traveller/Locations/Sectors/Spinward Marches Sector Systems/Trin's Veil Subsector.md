Trin's Veil gets its name from the reflective debris cloud that surrounds Trin, the subsector capital. This is the remains of a shattered moon and makes the night sky on Trin a glorious sight. It also interferes with navigation close to the world.

The subsector is entirely within the [[Imperium]] and backs onto the [[Gulf Subsector]] of Deneb. Although the [[Spinward Main]] does not run through Trin's Veil, a jump-2 ship can connect to it at [[Hexos]] (in Mora) or [[Bendor]] (in Glisten) after a simple transit via the Palique, Katarulu and Dodds clusters. Jump-2 is also required to reach Trin itself. However, trade is conducted on a large scale within the subsector's two main star clusters using jump-1 ships.

Trin's Veil is the responsibility of the 207th Fleet which, like the 100th in Glisten, is somewhat understrength.  Patrols are maintained from the fleet headquarters at Katarulu and bases on Murchison and Trin. The Sector Fleet maintains a reserve at Trin but this is a battle-reserve and rarely has vessels available for patrol work.

There are no [[Red Zone]]s in the subsector, but there are seven [[Amber Zone]]s ([[Hazel]], [[Edenelt]], [[Hammermium]], [[Robin]], [[Dodds]], [[Zephyr]], and [[Thisbe]]). [[Thisbe]] is not strictly an Amber Zone but can sometimes be dangerous; a long-term project is underway to improve the world's marginal atmosphere and hydrographics by transporting ice asteroids from the outsystem. Most are simply broken into small chunks and dispatched in a decaying orbit that will cause them to burn up in what little atmosphere there is, thereby adding to it. A few fragments do reach the ground, potentially causing a hazard.

The world of [[Prilissa]] is the origin of the Kian, a large flightless bird used as a beast of burden on many worlds and ceremonial mounts for the Imperial Household Cavalry. Kian fulfil many of the same functions as horses and have been exported almost as widely.

The Kian is a mammal, although it resembles a large flightless bird much like an ostrich. Kian are thought to have originated on Prilissa in the Spinward Marches but this is not certain. They are used as riding animals on many worlds and are more agile than horses. However, Kian cannot carry as much as a horse and, whilst faster over short distances, are slowed on a long march.

Kian have fur and, in some cases, vestigial forelimbs. This trait is common on some worlds and completely absent on others, suggesting that distinct breeds or sub-species are beginning to appear. Kian are favored by ranchers on many backwater worlds as they do not require the imported parts for maintenance that a vehicle would. They are herded for meat on some worlds or used to control and watch over herds of other farm animals. Kian generally get along well with horses, although most of those who use them choose one or the other as the riding style is quite different.
