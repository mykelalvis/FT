### MITHRIL
Mithril is one of the four Metal Worlds claimed by the [[Sword Worlds Confederation]] but not yet developed or colonized. The world is very suitable in most ways for colonization - it has a standard atmosphere and about 80% ocean coverage. However, Mithril is more than a little cold.

Much of Mithril's ocean surface is either frozen or prone to drifting ice and the land is swept by harsh winds and often blanketed by ice and snow. While this would not pose too much of a problem to high-technology settlers, it makes agriculture problematic and raises the cost of creating a viable colony.

Mithril lies on the Spinward Main and while vessels capable of jump-2 or more tend to bypass the system, some ships must come through. Those that can skim fuel from a gas giant and move on without visiting the world. A patrol vessel from the Confederation is sometimes stationed in the system and may challenge vessels passing through but, on the whole, Sword Worlders will not interfere with the navigational rights of passing vessels.

Vessels not equipped for fuel skimming must obtain their fuel from the planet, usually by landing in a remote area and running hoses to a source of water or landing in water and simply drawing it into the tanks. The Confederation does not appreciate this practice but has never done anything about it; ships landing on the world to refuel are technically violating Sword World sovereign territory but so long as Imperial vessels just refuel and leave, the Sword Worlders are not sufficiently outraged to confront the [[Imperium]].

Relatively few ships land at the Class E port, which is little more than a marked landing area with beacons and a cluster of huts nearby. Outsiders are not welcome at the port. Fuel and resupply are not available for passing vessels, although Sword World vessels on official business are a different matter and [[Sword Worlds]]-registered merchant ships might be more warmly received.

Although the population of Mithril is officially rated as zero as there is no permanent population, a handful of Sword Worlders operate the tiny port. This is one of the loneliest jobs in Charted Space - to be stationed with just a couple of companions on a planet several weeks from assistance if disaster strikes.

This tiny presence serves to support the Confederation's claim to ownership of the world, necessary for political reasons but not a pleasant posting. Few of the personnel deployed to Mithril Starport have ever ventured into the arctic wilderness surrounding the base as there is no

prospect for rescue if something goes wrong and they all have jobs to do at the port.

Exploration teams have surveyed the world, sometimes working out of the port, often reporting an unusual phenomenon known as the ephemeral glade. Mithril is normally very cold and its ecosystem has developed to take maximum advantage of short periods of above-zero temperatures. During these very brief warm periods (warm by Mithril's standards means a degree or so above freezing), an ephemeral glade may spring up, an area of plant life that grows from the thawing soil at incredible speed. Within a few hours, an area of grass-like plants up to 2-3 meters high can spring up.

Glades tend to be 2-3 kilometers across and rapidly attract animals from the surrounding area, drawn to the readily available food and shelter of the glade.
Once the temperature drops below freezing, the plants die rapidly and the animals depart after a last frenzy of feeding on the dying glade's bounty.

Among the animals attracted to a glade are Calamanders, scaly burrowing creatures with a complex society. Each group is centered on a female who bears young and seems to be the 'queen' of the group. She resides in a burrow that she rarely leaves, attended by several drone males. A third gender, referred to as a protector, digs tunnels, forages for food and, as the name suggests, fiercely protects the burrow. They are amphibious and prone to scavenge for food or shiny objects that they take back to the female, perhaps as gifts or trophies.

Crystallice are another creature native to Mithril and are, at best, a nuisance. They are tiny insect-like creatures that, even close up, resemble ice crystals.
They lie on the surface of snow or ice and attach themselves to passing creatures, chewing through clothing to reach exposed skin. At this point, they begin to burrow into the dermis, causing extreme pain and often considerable bleeding. Crystallice infestation can be fatal and best countered by picking the crystallice off before they burrow under the skin.
