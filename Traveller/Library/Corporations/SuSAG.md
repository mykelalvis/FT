### SuSAG

Schunamann und Sohn, AG LIC (SuSAG)
SuSAG is highly active in the chemical, pharmaceutical and engineering market sectors. Most of its products are commonplace, including many trusted brands, and its engineers have assisted in the constriction of several starports and other major facilities. SuSAG is involved in research into biochemical warfare and, although its PR arm makes much of the 'defences and protection' aspect of this activity, the firm does attract bad press. SuSAG makes some of the best hostile environment equipment available but is widely thought to use this as a cover for weapons research. It maintains small research facilities in remote parts of various star systems, heavily guarded and very secretive.

Also known as SuSAG, LIC, Schunamann und Sohn was first
registered in 252 as an Imperial corporation. However, the firm had
links to a defunct Sylean firm of much greater antiquity and still uses
the AG suffix as a reminder of its pedigree.

SuSAG started out as a manufacturer of psionic–enhancing drugs,
which was entirely acceptable in the early years of the Imperium
but ceased to be something a reputable (or legal) firm would be
involved with. SuSAG began to move into other areas just in time to
avoid disaster as the Psionics Suppressions kicked the bottom out
of that particular market.

SuSAG is today the premier Imperial chemical and pharmaceutical
corporation. Its biochemical warfare division has a particularly bad
reputation for safety, which is not entirely undeserved. As a result

of a lot of bad press as well as concerns about security and safety,
SuSAG normally sites its production and research plants in remote
and uninhabited areas or on planetoids.

SuSAG has extensive interests outside the Imperium, and one of
the largest Megacorporate security forces. The firm has shown
that it is entirely willing to interfere in local affairs in order to
protect its interests. It has also been accused of illegal research
and continued involvement in psionic drugs production despite
an Imperial injunction. To somewhat offset this bad reputation,
SuSAG subsidizes a number of medical charities and disaster–relief
agencies as well as sponsoring large numbers of medical students.


## SuSAG

Although no two megacorporations are exactly alike, there are enough similarities between them to allow a study of one to serve as a study of all. The following general survey of the history, organization and activities of SuSAG will illustrate how megacorporations operate and delineate their powers and limitations.

### HISTORY

Schunamann und Sohn, AG, LIC was founded in 252 by Gustav Schunamann, a professor of biochemical engineering and his son Reinhardt, a doctor of medicine. A few years earlier, the elder Schunamann had resigned his position at the Imperial University to pursue private research. The result of this research was the discovery of a radically new technique for the isolation of various forms of the psionic drug, psioniline. Schunamann patented the process and licensed it to several manufacturing concerns. By 252, using the royalties that had accumulated, the Schunamanns purchased a near bankrupt pharmaceuticals company, which carried an old Sylean charter (and was thus automatically entitled to a limited Imperial charter) and renamed it Schunamann und Sohn AG, LIC (retaining the archaic AG). Shortly afterward, Schunamann announced a new, more efficient process (which he had evidently discovered years before) and the new company, commonly known as SuSAG, rapidly drove almost all competing drugs off the market.

The company's early years were stormy ones. The Imperial University brought suit against SuSAG, charging that, as Schunamann had developed his processes while at the university, they belonged to the government. Other parties brought numerous additional lawsuits. SuSAG defended itself successfully from all these attacks but they instilled in the corporation, and the Schunamann family, a paranoia that was to heavily colour the firm's actions for the first two centuries of its existence. This paranoia, although lessened over the centuries, can still be detected in some of SuSAG's actions to this day.

Perhaps because he was a researcher at heart, Gustav established a policy of devoting large sums to exploratory research and SuSAG's well-equipped laboratories rapidly attracted some of the best minds in the Imperium, another characteristic of SuSAG that persists to this day. Gustav's heavy emphasis on research brought the company numerous new products and manufacturing processes, which laid a strong foundation for future growth. The discoveries were not always in the field of pharmaceuticals, however, and the company began to diversify into medical products, in general, and later into related areas such as chemistry and genetic engineering. The deep-set paranoia of the early years prevented SuSAG from selling or licensing any discoveries to other companies. Many good ideas languished in the company files for years, because SuSAG did not have the resources to develop them and did not want any other company to benefit from them.

SuSAG's dominance of the psi-drug market caused it to be hardest hit by the Psionics Suppressions of 800-826. The manufacture and sale of all psionic drugs was declared illegal, all manufacturing plants within the Imperium closed down and all stockpiles were confiscated. Although SuSAG had considerably diversified its activities by this time, the suppressions nearly destroyed the company. The massive loss of revenue forced a number of emergency measures on the company, including sizable loans from other megacorporations. As part of the arrangements, large blocks of SuSAG stock were transferred to other firms.

Up until that time, the Schunamann family had retained over 75% of SuSAG stock and the forced transfer caused considerable loss of revenue to them. Eventually, some of this stock was reclaimed but significant amounts are still retained by others, most notably Hortalez et Cie (9%), GSbAG (5%) and Sternmetal Horizons LIC. (3%). The resulting change in the board of directors was ultimately beneficial for SuSAG, since it diluted the paranoid tendencies of the Schunamann family, which had dominated the board up to that point.

Although it took decades to recover from the damage done by the Psionic Suppressions, SuSAG resumed slow, steady growth, gradually expanding into new markets, such as synthetics, industrial chemicals and (most controversially) chemical and biological warfare agents for the Imperial military. SuSAG is responsible for a number of major advances in anagathic research and is one of the largest suppliers of anagathic drugs in the Imperium. In addition, through a number of factories located outside the Imperium (owned by a chain of subsidiary companies), SuSAG has continued the manufacture of psionic drugs, some of which illicitly find their way back into the Imperium, where they etch premium prices because of their quality and purity. SuSAG does not engage in the smuggling of these drugs into the Imperium.

Throughout its development, SuSAG made it a policy to purchase control of numerous subsidiary companies. Often it was cheaper for SuSAG to acquire an existing company in order to move operations into a new region of space or move into a new field; SuSAG would buy a company to engage in operations with which SuSAG did not wish to have its name associated. The companies outside the Imperium, which manufacture psionic drugs, are owned through a long and complex chain of holding companies, dummy corporations and interlocking directorates.

Major subsidiary companies are under the control of the board of directors, lesser companies are under the control of the divisional vice- presidents or regional general managers.

### ORGANISATION

SuSAG is organised in a similar fashion to most other limited Imperial corporations; that is, there is a board of directors, a president and numerous vice presidents. One vice-president is responsible for the control of each of the seven divisions of the company: the pharmaceuticals division, the medical and surgical products division, the industrial chemicals division, the geneering division, the CBW (chemical and bacteriological warfare) division, the research division and the extra-Imperial division. Each divisional vice-president has a number of executive assistants who are not directly in the chain of command. These assist in the administration and operation of the division but do not set policy.

Under the divisional vice-presidents are the division's numerous regional general managers. The most important operating officers of SuSAG, these RGMs and assistants control the operations of a SuSAG division inside a particular region of space. A region may range in size from a few systems in the heavily populated regions of the Imperium around the [[Core sector]] , to several subsectors in more sparsely populated regions. Note that the boundaries of a region belonging to one division often do not completely coincide with those of another. In frontier regions, one person may occupy the position of RGM for several divisions. In more densely populated areas, there are several RGMs, who may consult with one another but only have authority over their own division's activities. This system could lead to inter divisional rivalry but seldom does, since each division rarely competes directly with another. Many times, however, subsidiary companies will be working at cross-purposes, sometimes actually engaging in trade wars with other SuSAG subsidiaries. Naturally, these are ended as soon as they are discovered but with an entity as large as SuSAG, it is difficult to keep track of who is and who is not on your side.

##### Advertising

An overall advertising policy is set by the board of directors. Individual divisions each have an advertising executive, responsible for overseeing the advertising for that division. Subsidiary companies coordinate their advertising efforts with those of SuSAG.

##### Security

Many megacorporations contract out all but the most important security measures to independent security companies. SuSAG maintains unusually large and well-equipped corporate security forces, which handle all aspects of their security requirements. There are many reasons behind this; many of SuSAG's products are compact, extremely valuable and easily resold on the black market. Because of the value of their manufacturing processes, SuSAG manufacturing plants and research installations are often the target of industrial espionage by rival firms. SuSAG's CBW installations are often the subject of raids by terrorists seeking to steal CBW weaponry, or sabotage by anti-CBW activists. The company's undeservedly poor reputation for safety, particularly in its CBW plants, causes a great deal of vandalism at all SuSAG installations.

These factors, combined with the company's extreme distrust of any outside agency, explain SuSAG's extensive security establishment.

Most security forces are under the direct control of the various RGMs and operate only in the region to which they are assigned. The board of directors, however, maintains several units of wide ranging troubleshooters, who are assigned to particularly sensitive areas of very important installations.

##### Mercenaries

In spite of its desire to keep everything in-house, SuSAG often hires mercenary units for actions that it does not wish its name (or that of a subsidiary ) to be associated. By company policy, mercenaries can only be hired on the authority of the RGM but this is usually done through several intermediaries (usually SuSAG security personnel).

### THE DIVISIONS

The operations of SuSAG's various divisions are outlined below.

![[JTAS-01-SusagOrgChart.jpg]]

#### Pharmaceuticals Division

This division manufactures and markets medical drugs for treatment and prevention of various pathological conditions, therapeutic drugs such as anagathics, veterinary and horticultural drugs, surgical drugs such as anesthetics and muscle-relaxants.

#### Medical and Surgical Products Division

This division manufactures and markets non-pharmaceutical medical and surgical products such as diagnostic equipment, surgical instruments and supplies, and prosthetic devices such as replacement limbs.

#### Industrial Chemicals Division

This division manufactures chemicals used by other companies in manufacturing processes. Several subsidiary companies provide chemicals of extreme purity for scientific applications.

#### Geneering Division

This division manufactures geneered organisms for specific industrial and agricultural applications.

#### CBW Division

This division manufactures chemical and bacteriological weapons and defences exclusively for the Imperial military and its allies. Despite the fact that all such plants are located on isolated, uninhabitable worlds, this division has a very poor reputation for safety.

#### Research Division

This division is not engaged in manufacturing but conducts a constant search for new products and new ways of producing old products.

#### Extra-Imperial Division

This division is in charge of all SuSAG activities outside the Imperium, which includes those of all SuSAG subsidiary companies. Many of these activities would be illegal if carried out inside the Imperium, such as the manufacture of psionic drugs.

Because of the lack of reliable protection for its installations and products, SuSAG security teams assigned to extra-imperial duties are as heavily equipped as most planetary military forces. They are often assigned company starships for the protection of extremely valuable facilities (such as the psi-drug factories).

### POLICIES AND GOALS

SuSAG's main goals are to make money, retain its position of power relative to other megacorporations, retain control of its current markets, develop new markets for old products, along with developing and marketing new products. SuSAG has a great desire to improve its poor public image, and spending billions of Credits annually on advertising.

SuSAG facilities engaged in the manufacture of extremely valuable or dangerous products (such as its pharmaceutical, psi- and CBW plants) are located in remote and sparsely populated areas whenever possible. This was done to minimise potential deaths, in the case of an accident, and to facilitate protection of the plants and their products. Psi-drug plants are especially vulnerable because of the high value of their product on the black market, so they receive especially high levels of protection from corporate security. CBW plants are usually assigned units of the Imperial military for protection but company security at these plants is also heavy.

### CORPORATE & GOVERNMENT RELATIONS

The Imperium has the power to tax megacorporations and regulate their actions. SuSAG's power, in certain areas, is probably equal to the Imperium's. Active hostilities, however, would be bad for business. SuSAG maintains that a stable interstellar government is good for business and that keeping the Imperium in power is in their own best interests. For this reason, SuSAG never actively opposes the Imperium or works for its downfall. This does not mean that no SuSAG division ever violates the law, merely that they keep violations to a minimum and try not to get caught.

Outside the Imperium, SuSAG still exercises restraint in opposing Imperial interests.

By Imperial law, SuSAG is required to comply with whatever local laws are in effect. As a general rule, SuSAG prefers not to overtly oppose a legitimate planetary government. Usually, the firm has sufficient covert influence to persuade a government to exempt it from most restrictions. Unlike most other megacorporations, few worlds are under SuSAG's direct control. This is due to a company policy, promulgated to help SuSAG's public image. Corporate control of a world is usually resented by the populace and, in SuSAG's case, could lead to outright rebellion. However, SuSAG retains covert political and economic control of a number of worlds throughout the Imperium and beyond, through subsidiaries.

### THE SPINWARD MARCHES

SuSAG's presence in the [[The Spinward Marches]] dates from the acquisition of a chemical facility on Mora in 427. Expansion proceeded rapidly and all divisions were active in the Marches by 600. Massive stockpiles of CBW weaponry and countermeasures were sold to the Imperium at the start of the Third Frontier War (none were used) and at the war's end a CBW plant was established on Shirene (Lunion subsector). SuSAG has other major facilities in Rhylanor, Fornice and Trin. SuSAG subsidiaries have facilities in most non-Zhodani systems. Each SuSAG division maintains offices at Class A and B starports in the Marches. SuSAG maintains no offices and owns no subsidiaries in territories under Zhodani control but some trade was done before the recent war. The extra-Imperial division maintains a large psi-drug manufacturing facility at Tarsus, as well as other (non-psi drug) facilities in the Zamine and Collace systems.

[[District 268]] is considered an important enough region to rate an RGM all its own.

### THE SOLOMANI RIM

SuSAG has an extensive presence in the Rim, dating from the acquisition of [[Inidu]] from its original owners in 425, just before the admission of the Easter Concord into the Imperium. All divisions of SuSAG are active in the Rim and its offices can be found at all Class A and B starports in Imperial space.

[[Inidu]] is owned by SuSAG's R&D division and the populace is employed by SuSAG. The extra-Imperial division, through subsidiary companies, has installations on dozens of worlds within the Solomani Confederation. SuSAG's affiliation with these companies is kept hidden from the public at large, because of the bad feeling that would be generated by an Imperial firm controlling Solomani companies.

Manufacture of psi-drugs is illegal in the Solomani Confederation and SuSAG runs no psi-drug plants there (although, as with the Imperium, smuggled SuSAG psi-drugs are sold on the black market).
