# Pysadi

[[CT-TTA-109.jpg|Pysadi]]

Pysadi has been dominated for many years by the [[#Mother Church|a religious dictatorship]] that worships the planet itself and imposes a number of very strict laws regarding religious matters.  Offworlders have been known to unwittingly fall foul of these laws.

Notably, Pysadian law prohibits alcohol. This raises issues since the world is well known for its fruit crops and, while exported fruit makes good wine, that grown on-planet and fermented there produces some of the finest wines in [[Charted Space]]. The government has been cracking down on illegal winemaking operations in remote areas and, while this is strictly an internal matter, the lure of big money for Pysadian [[Atrake]] wine (made on-planet from [[Trake]] fruits) has brought many offworld entrepreneurs to Pysadi in search of their fortune. Recent newscasts about the Pysadian Booze Wars are massively exaggerated but nonetheless offworlders must be careful not to become involved.

Pysadi (0608-C4-76507-4) is a small world (some 6400km in diameter with a standard, [[#tainted atmosphere]] and seas covering about 60% of the planetary surface. The [[#Tainted Atmosphere|atmosphere]], tainted due to the presence of gaseous components which cause giddiness, loss of coordination and mental control, and eventual death in many off-world life forms, makes it necessary for humans and [[Vargr]] to wear a filter mask. A cheap, reusable filter mask is available locally at a cost of Cr10 each. The planet is frequently visited by starships in need of fuel, thanks to its convenient location between [[Traveller/Locations/Sectors/Spinward Marches Sector Systems/Aramis Subsector Systems/Aramis|Aramis]] and [[Aramanx]]; despite this frequency of contact, the world is properly considered a part of the  [[Scatters]], and is treated as a backwater.

The planet has a population of 1.9 million, most of which is clustered in the fertile valleys of the world's major continent, [[#Mere]]. These valleys are separated by mountain ranges which serve as natural game preserves: most communities on the planet supplement food crops by hunting and trapping expeditions. The cities on Pysadi are primarily religious communities, serving as focal points for the public services operated by the all-encompassing [[#Mother Church]].

The [[#Mother Church]] is an authoritarian religious institution dedicated to the management and control of the entire world. This religious dictatorship vests power in the Epopt- generally regarded as a figurehead-and an advisory council of priests who actually carry out the routine tasks of government. Society is tightly controlled, but the people are generally contented and unaware of the pervasive influence of their church government. A strict law level prohibits guns (and frowns on weapons in general), greatly restricts freedom of movement and action, and absolutely forbids (due to religious strictures) the manufacture, sale, or consumption of alcohol.

Pysadi has a tech level of 4, and is generally an agrarian society. A farming world, Pysadi's economy is centered around agriculture in the fertile valleys of Mere, supplemented by stock raising, fishing, and hunting. The church makes use of excess agricultural products to guard against future periods of famine and drought, or to sell offworld in exchange for imported goods. All church members are expected to voluntarily contribute such excesses, and this is usually the case. The church has been known to extract these contributions by force when necessary.

The planet has only one land-mass of continental size, plus a scattering of small islands. The continent, Mere, is the center of population (more than 97% of the people live there). The world's capital, and largest city, Sadi, is located on Mere's east coast, and is linked to the various farm communities of More by a network of rail lines.

# Tainted Atmosphere

In situations where Pysadi's tainted atmosphere is breathed by unprotected individuals, the effects of the taint are handled as foliows: 1D damage points are applied every four combat rounds to the endurance of the breathing character; when endurance reaches zero, he passes out.

If a breach is made in a sealed building, the gradual diffusion of tainted air will proceed outward from the breach in an expanding hemisphere at a rate of five squares each combat round, interior walls are not sealed, though they may slow the diffusion of the air. Individuals in the building will not suffer the effects of the taint: until they begin breathing it.

While breathing the tainted atmosphere, characters are likely to become giddy, doing foolish and unpredictable things. Mental control is lost gradually. To simulate this, affected characters may attempt to take action as they would normally. However, they must roll their intelligence or less to complete the action; failure of the roll causes them to do something unexpected (laughing uncontrollably, firing a gun off into the air, etc.) Moreover, intelligence is reduced each round at the same rate as endurance. When intelligence reaches 1, the character is helpless, even if he is still conscious.

Prolonged exposure to the atmosphere is not particularly harmful. Most fatalities caused by the tainted air are the result of foolish acts committed under the influence of the gas.

# Mere

Pysadi's sole continent is a mountainous region dominated by a central plain. On the shores of the calm waters of the Womb Sea, an almost landlocked body of water, the city of Sadi serves as the focal point for the church, the government, and the economy; it is also the location of the only starport on the world and the hub of the Merespan railroad network.

The central plain of More is small and relatively infertile, and has been allowed to remain grassland used mostly for small herds of grazing stock. Pysadi's farmland is found in the fertile mountain valleys, where a cool, gentle climate and the runoff from the mountain heights combine to produce excellent conditions for agriculture. Grains and fruits from Pysadi's valley farms are grown for local consumption and contributed to the church, which expects them. Pysadian produce is famed far and wide for taste and quality.

# Communities

The continent is widely, if sparsely settled.  In all, there are nine towns and about forty settlements, plus the city of [[#Sadi]], on Pysadi. Most communities are located in the valleys, along the rail lines. Towns leveraging about 20.000 population, with an additional 20,000 or so in outlying farms) are situated at the ends of various rail lines, and serve as granaries, church centers, and rail maintenance depots. Settlements are much smaller, and consist of little more than a train station, a place of worship, and a few other buildings needed to act as a focal point for the 3-5,000 people who live on farms within a 60 kilometer radius of the settlement proper, and perhaps twice that many in isolated holdings at greater distances.

## Sadi

With a population of 200,000, Sadi is far and away the largest population center on Pysadi. In addition to housing the Epoptial Palace of the [[#Mother Church]], and with it the planet's governmental center, Sadi is the economic hub of Pysadi. Trade through Pysadi Starport, the rail net, and the Mother Banl<-a church-affiliated institution which controls everything from money supply to the ownership of commodity markets and the railroads-all are vital to Sadi's role as the central pillar of the planetary society.

The city is divided into three districts, plus the starport (which, as an offworld enclave subject to the rules of extrality, is completely independent from planetary controll. The districts which comprise Sadi proper are described below.

### Old Town

The Old Town is the original city, established as an interim settlement in the early stages of the planet's colonization. Situated near the starport grounds, it consists of crowded blocks of buildings squeezed between large plazas and parks. The plazas belong to the church; some contain church administration facilities, others hold the many imposing places of worship which are found throughout Sadi.

While a few are quiet, secluded, open areas given over to fountains and ponds, trees, grass, and other aesthetically pleasing elements. Parks, on the other hand, are surrounded by massive brick walls, and are plainly marked as being off limits to any but church-authorized persons. Guards are posted at the securely barred gates, and questions about the parks elicit only the briefest replies, usually to the effect that these are areas where religious instruction is carried out.

### Business District

The Business District lies beyond the Old Town, closer to the harbor and its many wharves. The main rail terminus of Sadi is located at the heart of the business district, which is mostly composed of church-owned warehouses and granaries. Produce from the country is offloaded from ships or trains, stored in these large facilities, and dispersed back to the communities at need or transferred to the starport for shipment offworld.

### Suburb

The Suburb is an enlargement of the city built to handle the gradual increase in population which has occurred over the year. It consists of well-designed houses clustered around local churches and complexes of stores and administrative offices. The suburb's residents are primarily connected with the massive church bureaucracy.

### Architecture

Buildings intended for human habitation on Pysadi have been shaped by the special nature of the planet's ecology and culture. The atmospheric taint, which is dangerous due to its unsettling effect on the human brain, makes it necessary that all buildings be sealed and equipped with filtering devices that screen out the dangerous components. Persons inside these buildings are able to dispense with filter masks.

On the other hand, the principles of Pysadian religion and culture encourage communication with nature. Courtyards (sometimes open, sometimes enclosed by glass and filter-conditioned) are common, as are large expanses of windows designed to allow the best possible view. These elements combine to make Pysadian architecture highly distinctive in nature.

### Mother Church

Religious institution and ruling body of Pysadi. Adherents worship the world itself, believing Pysadi to be the mother of all things. The Mother Church closely controls the lives of Pysadi's people. Alcohol is forbidden.

The religious beliefs of the Pysadian populace are appropriate to their agrarian society. The religion is a form of world worship which treats Mother Pysadi as the giver of all things. Peace, cooperation, and communion with nature are stressed as ideals all people should strive for. The faith of the Mother Church runs strong and deep, from the lowliest farmer to the Epopt himself. Hypocrisy is not a characteristic of any facet of the church, which undertakes its duties seriously and has by and large done a good job of handling its responsibilities. Though rigid in its control over Pysadi, the church is perceived as beneficial and actually does act for the good of the community.

Of the Mother Church's many unusual practices, the one best known among offworiders is "Communion with Mother Pysadi", in which, with attendant ceremony to set the proper mood, a worshiper takes a few breaths of unfiltered air; short exposure can bring about a state of religious euphoria; longer exposure can result in oracular visions of Mother Pysadi

The hierarchy of the Mother Church is headed by the Epopt, who rarely exercises more than nominal control over society. Real power is vested in the next level, an advisory council of priests who control church and government activities. The composition and number of this council varies, but a core of five influential members, heading up the five major branches of the government, are of most importance. The five branches include:

_The Distributory_, which runs shops and distribution media.

_The Productionary_, concerned with agricultural production.

The Propagatory, which handles education, particularly religious education.

_The Offerartory_, concerned with the collection of offerings (i.e, taxes)-generally collected in kind (grain or meat, sometimes labor).

_The Salvors_, who act as the enforcement arm of the church.

Many aspects of the church are to some degree secret, or at least not widely known off Pysadi. Inner rituals of the church and priesthood, the details of the planetary economy and the actual political hierarchy within the advisory council are among those things which are not generally knownor discussed-by the average citizen, particularly with offworlders.

### Railroads

The Merespan Rail Line is the major transport system on Pysadi. Emanating like spokes from the city of Sadi, rail lines connect the city to the various outlying communities. Along most lines, the railroad is a single track: low-priority trains are shunted onto sidings to allow those with a higher priority to pass in either direction.

The railroads are operated and maintained by the Rail Corps, a hereditary group (augmented as needed with new recruits) descended from the original rail construction workers who established the railroads in the early days of settlement on Pysadi. The Corps is responsible, under the auspices of the Productionary, for maintaining and repairing every kilometer of track, and for the operation and maintenance of the trains themselves.

The most common type of train carries both cargo and passengers, and runs once per week on each spoke. Trains can achieve speeds of 110 kph, and generally take six days to make the round trip out from Sadi and back. The trains do not run on Senday; a train will remain in whatever settlement it happens to stop in for an entire day in such cases. These stops are welcomed by the settlement so favored, as they bring visitors and news that would otherwise pass on without stopping for more than the briefest of halts.

### Referee's Note

Though trains theoretically have a schedule, these are so frequently disrupted as to be random. Throw 1D to determine the number of days before a train is due to leave Sadi. It spends 3 days travelling to the end of the line, and 3 days on the return journey. If Senday falls at any point of the trip, the train does not move that day. On each trip, there will be a one day delay ldue to rail repairs or a higher-priority trainl on a roll of 7 + . Train passage costs Cr12 per hex one way, or Cr20 per hex round trip.

### Other Transport

While railroads are ubiquitous, Pysadi is much less progressive where other forms of transportation are concerned. Roads are primitive at best, and vehicles more advanced than carts or wagons are rare. ATVs, groundcars, and similar equipment are considered an offense to Mother Pysadi, due to the damage they cause to ground cover and other factors. They may be used around the city/starport complex in relative freedom, but use outside the city is definitely out of the question.

Most other forms of transportation are regulated by the church's tight control over movement. Permits are required to operate any starship, ship's boat, grav vehicle, or aircraft anywhere on the planet, except for approaches to and from the starport. The reasons for this have never been made clear, but violation of these restrictions can result in heavy fines and/or confiscation.  It should be noted, however, that Pysadi has little detection apparatus and no local naval forces, so their ability to enforce these restrictions is limited. Nonetheless the visitor who flouts authority in this fashion can expect an unpleasant welcome if he is foolish enough to return.

Sea Lanes: Some sea transport exists on Pysadi, primarily along the coast. Heavy bulk cargos are often shipped by sea in large ocean-going barges. Barges average 10 kph, and generally lay up on religious days in observance of the prohibition on work. Generally, barges do not carry passengers, but a captain can sometimes be persuaded to carry a group for a small fee (perhaps Cr100 each).

### The Map

The map of Pysadi shows the world using a geodesic map grid dividing the world into hexagons and triangles, if out out and folded, the map would create an icosahedron (a twenty-sided polygonl which approaches a globe in shape.

Each hexagon measures approximately 575 kilometers across, and can be used to judge scale and distance. Within each hexagon is one or more terrain types, showing the nature of the area.

The players and referee can use the information on the map to determine the time and distance required for various journeys.

The terrain key indicates the types of terrain and shows the movement rates expected for the terrain type and means of transportation being used. For example, the clear terrain movement rate for individuals is 220 hours per hex ion foot). The rate takes rest into account, assuming that walking takes up half the time l11 hours per dayl and that characters rest for the remaining 1 1 hours. The resulting speed is about 5.5 kilometers per hour, reflecting a lack of roads or paths on Pysadi; crossing a clear hex takes 10 days. Rail and boat movement rates do not assume any need to rest.

If no movement rate is listed next to a terrain symbol, use the movement rate listed for other terrain types in the hex.

### Time

The local day is 22 hours long (about 11 hours of day and 11 hours of night). The week of seven days is ended by a day of rest (Senday) on which no business is transacted. Throw 1D+1 for the current day of the week when the March Harrier arrives on Pysadi; if it is Senday, even the starport will be closed to traffic in deference to local sensibilities, and the ship will have to remain in orbit an extra day.

## Itzeny

ltzeny is located in a mountain valley at the end of the southwest rail line. The town has a resident population of around 200, mostly railroad personnel, church staff, and some agents of the Distributory. The remainder of the population associated with the town live on scattered farms situated up to 100 kilometers away in all directions. Local transport is virtually nonexistent, with beast-drawn wagons being the primary method of transport.
