## Introduction

The original idea behind this supplement
started when I decided to do a character-a-day
back at the beginning of 2021. I opted to
generate characters for Mongoose Traveller
2nd edition. What is included here is an
expandedversion ofthefirstdozenofthose
characters.

Eachcharacterwasgeneratedrandomly,rolling
2d6 for each characteristic in order and
sticking with whatever was rolled. Likewise,

capabilities.

Mostofthecharacterscomefromeitherthe
**_Reft_** sectororthe **_TrojanReach_** ,andspecific
worldswill sometimesbementionedintheir
backgrounds. As always, feel free to make
changes if this doesn’t suit ‘Your Traveller
Campaign’ (YTU).

Some characters are mentioned as being
“Islanders”. These are descendents of the

Cr80,000; A share in the Far Trader [[#Doubting the Moment]], a 200t Far Trader. Arkurlua has been acting as the ship’s Steward and Broker, getting them deals and passengers that they wouldn’t otherwise get.


_A freelance journalist trying to find the one big story to bring her fame and fortune._

Arkurlua came from a poor background, and her chances to do well have been marred by bad luck and bad decisions. She feels that the universe owes her and that she shouldn't have to do much to get it. She doesn’t plan to betray people, but tends to make decisions that provide short term benefit to herself. 

Akurlua is a 34 year old Vilani woman with a thin build and short dark hair. She is from the world of Pichot (Trojan Reach/Tobia/3015), who managed to catch alucky break when she got a sponsorship to a University at Tobia. However, she wasted her time there partying and ended up dropping out of university before she graduated. 

Through a chance meeting, she managed to get a job as a journalist at [[Tobia Uncovered!]], a sleazy news organisation known for being rather fast and loose with the truth. She was on the cusp of breaking a major corruption scandal, when her boss [[#Ikam Sakiluur]] stole the story from her. When the story turned out to be a scam, the blame was nevertheless put on her, giving her a bad reputation and ruining her chances of getting a decent job elsewhere.

However, she got a sizeable payout on the condition so she kept quiet.


Akurla then got a job working as an administrator at the insurance fraud investigation firm [[Sag Mekilure]] but she soon got bored with that, dropping out after wrangling a ship share for herself. She's now looking for something more interesting, preferably in journalism. Anything that pays well without her having to do too much work herself.

[[AT12-020.jpg|Ikam]]

Ikam Isusa Sakiluur
Vilani, Male, 55 Rival
UPP : 7B7CAB
Deception 3, Persuade 3, Profession (Journalist) 2


News editor at [[Tobia Uncovered!]], known for taking credit for other people’s stories and blaming them for his mistakes. Has friends in all the right places though so has been able to get away with it for most of his career.

## Story Hooks
### Providing Passage 
If the Travellers are looking for passage, then Arkurla could be the person they talk to. The Doubting the Moment isn’t the newest ship, but she will assure them that it is reliable and will get them to where they need to go- no questions asked. This last part is a lie, since she will be quite inquisitive once they are onboard, looking to see if they can be of any advantage to her in her quest for story leads.

### Providing Passage (Free)
If the Travellers are looking for passage, then someone may suggest the Doubting the Moment and offer to fund their trip- as long as they take some bugs onboard. They represent Sag Mekilure, an insurance fraud investigation company who believe that Arkula and the crew were responsible for fraud concerning a previous ship, the Momentary Doubts. They’d like the PCs to try and get the crew to confess, through boasting or inability to keep a secret. They will pay a bonus of Cr50K if evidence is found.

### Information
If the Travellers are looking for information about shady dealings on a world, then they may be pointed at Arkurla. She and her ship won’t have been here long, but she has been asking around about the same subject herself. The locals know that she’s found something out, but aren’t certain what. She is still looking for another big story with which to make her mark.

### Bounty
There is a reward of Cr75,000 being offered for anyone who returns Arkurla Akhar to Tobia, so that she can be questioned concerning some missing records concerning an insurance claim on the ship Momentary Doubts. If she were to be returned in a cold sleep berth with no memory of how she got there, then few questions would be asked. The patron is a sub-contractor of Sag Mekilure, but doesn’t have direct links to that company.


### People Smuggling 
Arkurla is following up on some leads involving people smuggling through Imisaa (Trojan Reach/Tobia/2916), and is looking for someone capable of sneaking around some offices of a company called Paternity Inc. She can’t offer much, only Cr10,000, but claims that the company in question is kidnapping children from the Outrim Void and selling them on to families through an orphanage. 

Paternity Inc is smuggling children, but they are actually rescued slaves from the Glorious Empire. If she finds this out Arkurla will still want to publish a big story even if it blows their cover. See the section on Paternity Inc for more details.


### Fighting Crime

At a class A or B star port, Arkurla has been investigating a criminal organisation running scams on local workers, collecting ‘union fees’ in order to allow them to work. This is illegal but the gang has blackmail material on local law enforcement which is preventing them from intervening. The Travellers witness Arkurla being threatened or kidnapped by the gang- they can either intervene or do nothing. Later, the Doubt will post a missing person notice at the port. Arkurla is more interested in getting and selling a story than in actually resolving the situation.

Yacht “ [[#The Little Yellow Flyer]] ” (25% paid), Ship Shares x2

_A noble who has ended up fighting for the rights of worlds versus big corporations. _

He could have had a good life, but let himself be dragged into the real world with all its complications. He still gives an aura of being a layabout playboy, but that role has lost its attractions and he now wants to achieve things. He gives an appearance of not caring, but he'll try to involve himself if he can. 


Balir was a layabout noble's son on the world of [[Peshtorno]] (Reft/Vestus/0208) who started off life with little ambition to achieve anything. He tried to get into university, but was rejected even with his connections, so he decided to go on the party circuit. 

His popularity at parties got him contacts in the government, especially with the naval officer [[#Captain Zimka]], and he used them to kick start a career in politics. However, he noticed that what was good for the Imperium wasn’t necessarily good for [[Peshtorno]], and started campaigning for policies that put his world first. This started making him enemies, and his friendship with Zimka turned into a rivalry.

He soon made friends with [[#Countess Rimuur]], and against her better judgement the two became romantically entangled. She provided connections which boosted his career further and brought him to the attention of a group of nobles trying to further his homeworld's agenda. It failed and someone even tried to assassinate him. 

Though he survived he gained a cybernetic left arm for his troubles and decided to take a short break from politics, returning to the pleasures of his estates back home. 

After a few years, he tried to worm his way back into politics, again campaigning for the rights of individual worlds. This put him directly at odds with [[#Baron Aligikhar]] in the Sector's Imperial court who was campaigning for greater Imperium involvement. 

He decided to officially bow out of political life, wrangling himself a nice yacht in the process and a big payout from his business connections. However, he still unofficially gets involved where he can, helping grass roots organisations with advice and funding.

## Story Hooks


### Seeking High Passage
The Count is looking for a clandestine ride to a nearby world, whilst his own Yacht The Little Yellow Flyer goes a different route. He will have a couple of bodyguards with him and will pay for all the staterooms aboard the ship so that they have it to themselves. 

Whilst onboard, he may try to get the crew involved in his next set of plans.


### Party
The Travellers encounter the Count at a social event, where he is surrounded by a crowd of hangers on, attracted by his wit, stories and generosity. If they are interesting enough, then he may take an interest in their affairs, or be willing to provide passage to a nearby world. 

This is especially true if they are taking on jobs which aid the rights of local worlds.


### Cat Amongst the Pigeons
The Count is looking for a group of people to make asuitable amount of noise in order to stir things up in certain political circles. 

An administration building belonging to an off-world company needs breaking into, and some things need stealing- but exactly what things doesn’t matter, as long as it looks like important information was taken. 

He just needs to make people panic to help him follow the communications chain to find out who is really in charge.

### Love Letter

When the Travellers are on, or around, a garden world, they are approached by the Count. He is looking for someone who can be discreet and presentable in polite company. He wants to get a letter (actually written on paper) to the Countess who is at a noble event down on the planet. Her husband mustn't find out about it. 

He can’t go himself, because he wants to avoid being seen there but can provide invitations to the event to the Travellers. When the Countess receives the letter, she may want to provide a reply (which will require finding pen, ink and paper), or may even want herself ‘smuggled’ up to the high port for a night of dalliance. Then of course, she needs to get back. 

Getting a free invitation to a party may be sufficient payment enough, especially if the Travellers have other reasons to attend. If not, the Count may be argued up to Cr10,000. It’s not as if it’s risky. The Countess won’t do anything so crude as offer money, but will owe the Travellers a favour and may be a useful contact- especially if they manage to smuggle her out.


### The Captain

There is a clash of personalities between the Count and [[#Captain Zimka]]. The Count is planning a fundraising event on a local world to raise awareness of a new industrial plant being built by GeDeCo, which will hurt the world's ecology. However, the plant will also be beneficial to the Imperium and help local jobs, improving re-election  chances of a pro-Imperium faction.

The navy can't get directly involved, so it needs a small team to infiltrate the rally and disrupt the proceedings, planting evidence that the Count is being paid by another company. 

Note that Captain Zimka merely disagrees with the Count’s decisions, he doesn’t want to see him physically harmed in any way.


### In Need of Support
If the Travellers are in need of some political clout, then the Count may be willing to help, especially if it involves the rights of individual world's against the Imperium's military industrial complex. He might approach them if they are working 'on the right side', or they could hear of him as a potential ally. 

As well as having his own funds, he also has contacts with various political groups who are always looking for those able to get tasks done and have the money to pay.
