#### BATTLESHIP CLASS:VOROSHILEF

The pride of Dimanaam Shipyards is the Voroshilef -class battleship, a hardy, versatile, well-armed capital ship that is built to last. TheVoroshilef is designed with a war of attrition in  mind. In naval circles, it is called the 'doomsday dreadnought' not because it is more capable than other ships but more so because it is not. Its designers assert that its slightly lower Tech Level makes it invaluable in the event of a large, drawn-out interstellar conflict. At TL13, crews will be better able to maintain the Voroshilef with parts on hand and would not have to rely on the ready availability of TL15 replacements and materials. Hubris in the Admiralty has made the Voroshilef program a controversial one. The Imperium mostly builds ships designed to win short battles with overpowering force. Only the most pragmatic officers of the flag are willing to entertain the notion that the Imperium could get drawn into a long, difficult conflict. Should the project take hold, Dimanaam expects to massively expand its shipyard and attract a large labour force to build many more ships of the class.
