![[AntStat-Cover.jpg|200]]
The Harcana corporation is known for it’s cutting edge research in the many industries in which it does business. It maintains a number of research facilities across the entire Sonora Sector. One of these facilities is at an orbital space station in the Anetbi sub-sector. The planet 330-348 is a vacant world. It is owned by the Confederation of Independent worlds. The Harcana corporation has been given a long term lease to maintain a station orbiting the planet for the purpose of conducting research. Occasional pirate sightings in that system have made visits to 330-348 a rare occurrence.

The nature of the research being conducted at this facility is a closely held secret. The company does not share such information with outsiders. The station is called the Antioch. It is a multi- level research facility in high orbit over the planet.

Recently, however, communication with the station has been lost. Harcana executives have become increasingly concerned. The research is being done at this station is obviously valuable and important to the company. The CEO of the corporation has authorized Emanuel Steward to commission a team to visit the station and find out what is going on there. Mission objectives include:

- Finding the nature of the disturbance
- Rescuing any scientists left alive on the station
- Recovering sensitive corporate research and data with the utmost discretion

Emanuel will find the team on whatever planet they are currently visiting. He will offer them CR25000 to visit the station and find out what is going on there. For every scientist brought back alive he will offer a bonus of CR 10000. For recovering the research data of the facility he will offer another CR 10000.

There are a number of threats to the team aboard the Antioch:

1. The players will be unaware that this station has a silent alarm ringing when they arrive. The station is in self-destruct mode and will blow up in two hours unless the countdown is interrupted in some manner.
2. Two insane people are aboard and are armed. Both are extremely hostile
3. The chemical weapon that has been released into the station is still live and may affect the team members
4. Shots fired inside the station may cause a hull breach and could be extremely dangerous. See the hull breach section at the end of the adventure.

There are a number of things that the adventurers could do during this adventure that are worth money to them. These include:

1. Rescuing the scientist in the pinnace on deck four
2. Not killing but subduing either of the insane crew members
3. Obtaining the research log from the conference room on deck two
4. Obtaining the research data from the science computers on deck three
5. Investigating the ship in general and determining that a chemical warfare agent has been released and caused crew members to go berserk

Ultimately the mission has a time element to it. The station will blow up unless the self destruct is stopped. So timely investigation and escape are the essential components of the mission. This time limit can be extended or shortened at the discretion of the GM as appropriate to the game. From the point that the travelers discover that the station is going to blow up there should be a limited amount of time to complete the mission and escape before it goes.

For purposes of this adventure the travelers will need access to a ship of some sort which can be piloted and bring them to and from this station. Escape from the station can be made using the pinnace that remains undamaged aboard the station.

# Key to the Antioch Station

The Antioch is an orbital research station. It has no propulsion systems beyond those to keep the craft in high orbit above the planet. The ship is in self destruct mode. When the travelers board the craft they will be unaware of this. But when they reach deck level three they will discover that a silent alarm is going off. When they investigate this (or if they investigate this) they may discover that they have only a limited time to get off the station again before it blows up. A nuclear device is imbedded in the design of the station and will set off an explosion less than two hours after arrival.

## Deck Level One

![[AntStat-01.jpg|100]]
[[AntStat-01.jpg|Level One]]

1. Elevator

All travel between deck levels on the station is done using this elevator. It is centrally located in the station. The elevator on this level is located in large square room which gives access to the other rooms on this level.

2. Airlock

Access to the station can be obtained using this airlock. Located here in the airlock are two Vacc suits. All others are either in use or have been damaged or lost.

3. Airlock Two

Access to the station can be obtained using this airlock. None of the Vacc suits which are usually located in this area are present.

4. Station Command

Essential functions of the station are run from this area. Viewing screens in this area show certain areas inside and outside of the ship at all times. Cameras are set up outside of the airlocks and in areas not easily visible to those inside the ship so as to prevent any unauthorized access to the station.

Several comfortable command chairs are set up. Computer terminals are located here for the use of the command crew. Controls for external weaponry are located here as are communications devices.

External weaponry on this station is limited as it is intended only to be a research facility. But pirates and other undesirables must be prevented from easy access to the station. Four hard points are located outside the station at optimal points. Each has a dual laser turret.

A large communications dish is located on the hull just outside of this room and allows communication with representatives of the corporation at extreme distances. Such communications ended about a month ago.

In two of the command chairs are the dead bodies of members of the station crew. Their identities are impossible to determine as both of them have had their heads severed. One is a male and the other is a female. That is all that can be easily determined without further information. Neither wears an identity tag. And both are missing sidearms.

A great deal of blood stains the floor here. Blood is also smeared on one of the windows looking outside of the station from here.

5. Computer Room

The station’s computer is located here. It appears to be offline. The reason for this is unclear. But there is a great deal of blood here staining the chairs and the console. No body is present.

6. Medical Bay

On the floor of this room is the symbol of the medical profession widely recognized across the Sonora sector. There is an operating table along with the equipment necessary to use it. A laser scalpel and a robotic arm to use it with are located at the operating table. A great deal of blood is all over the operating table as is the remains of the doctor. It appears that he was sawed in half with his own scalpel.

A great deal of other medical gear and equipment can be found here. In addition to this gear there is a drug cabinet here for the use of the station physician. It seems to have been ransacked. All that remains are a dose of antitoxin and a dose of metabolic.

## Deck Level Two

![[AntStat-02.jpg|100]]
[[AntStat-02.jpg|Deck Level Two]]

This level is primarily for crew quarters and everyday living.

1. Elevator Room

Like the other areas of the station this area leads to an elevator and to other rooms on the deck. A blood trail leads from the elevator towards area 2.

2. Bathroom

This room has three shower stalls, two bath tubs, several toilets and a row of sinks. Two severed heads are propped up in two of the sinks so as to face the doorway when one enters.

Hiding in one of the shower stalls is a deranged man slumped down and hiding. He has a dagger which is stained with the blood of several crewmen of the station. He will lash out dangerously at the first person to open the shower stall. If no one opens it then he will attack after a few moments if he thinks that he can ambush someone.

Ramiz is armed with a dagger and is insane. He is extremely dangerous and delusional. He believes that anyone aboard the station is an invading alien species. He wears a green keycard around his neck which is stained with blood. Ramiz has killed several of his crew members thinking that they were aliens.

If he could be captured alive the corporation would pay for his rescue.

3. Conference Room

A long table and chairs are located here along with a viewing screen and a computer terminal. This terminal is not like the others on the station. It has a slot for a key card which must be inserted before the computer can be accessed. Should a green keycard be placed in the computer

then one could access the research for the station and download a disk with the data. The corporation would pay for this data if it can be retrieved.

The research data will reveal that a new chemical weapon has been discovered by the research team. Testing on animal subjects on the world below indicates that it causes a delusional and highly aggressive state among the animals. Those animals affected began fighting amongst themselves and killed most of the population on the planet within days. Later entries in the computer log indicate that a series of mishaps took place on the station and that there was some kind of violation of the security protocols aboard the station. A scientist named Ramiz apparently killed the doctor and then could not be located. This was the last entry.

4. Mess Hall

Two tables are located here for eating and recreation. There are view screens here for the entertainment of crew members who are off duty. The tables still have dishes and eating utensils on them as if something interrupted meal time. Blood stains on the tables and ground here suggest that some kind of combat took place here. There is a blast mark on a bulkhead indicating that at least one shot was fired here.

No bodies are located here.

5. Crew Quarters

This room has several bunks for the crew members to sleep. Several of them have dead bodies lying in them. They appear to have been silently killed in their sleep. None appear to have defended themselves.

Words are painted on the wall here in blood.

“Die invaders!”

## Deck Level Three

![[AntStat-03.jpg|100]]
[[AntStat-03.jpg|Deck Level Three]]

This is the engineering and science research deck. The power cells for the station along with the generators are located here. A number of other important locations are located here as well. Each is numbered as a separate area even though none of this level is actually partitioned. On this level the lights are blinking on an off to indicate some kind of alarm has been set off.

1. Elevator

This is the elevator that takes people to other levels of the station.

2. Computer Stations

The Antioch has several computers aboard. These are being used for corporate research.

Although both require passwords that the travelers will not have both have visual screens which are flashing an alarm message.

“Alert! Containment breach! Self Destruct imminent. You have ### minutes to evacuate”

The ### can be filled in by the GM as appropriate for the adventure. If the travelers discover this message they should be allowed a limited time to continue investigating and then escaping the facility or disarming the device if they want to risk trying.

Disarming the self destruct could happen in a couple of possible ways:

1. They could hack into the computer system and then try to disarm it from there. Any attempt to do so would require a computer skill and a modified roll of 11 or higher.
2. The travelers could explore the room and find the device. Disarming the nuclear device would require an Engineering skill and a modified roll of 11 or higher.
3. Ship Generator

Power for the Antioch is generated here from this device. It seems to be operating normally.

4. Science Station One

This area seems to be the focus of the science experiments aboard the Antioch. Two large chemical storage containers are located here along with an unusual device which seems to be used for chemical reactions. One of the chemical containers seems to be damaged and leaking liquid slowly onto the floor.

This liquid is the cause of the problems aboard the Antioch. Research on this station has been about chemical weapons production. The chemical leaking here is test agent A107B-X3. This substance has been unleashed on the surface below and has caused animal life there to go insane and kill each other off. Unfortunately it seems to work well on humans as well as evidenced by the destruction on this station.

Antitoxin will cure the condition caused by this chemical. One does can be found in the medical bay.

Anyone getting within ten feet of this leak will need to roll 2D6 and check it against their stamina. Anyone who rolls greater than their stamina will be affected by the agent. In 1D minutes the person will begin suffering hallucinations. They will soon go insane and begin attacking everyone around them. Anyone wearing a vacc suit will be immune to this effect.

5. Nuclear Device

The corporation understood the risks of this kind of research. To prevent potential release of this chemical by mistake they placed a self destruct mechanism aboard. They also anticipated that the device might be used in case of attack by pirates as well.

The device is far too big to be carried off even if it is disabled. Even if it could be carried off the Harcana Corporation will send operatives to gain it’s return.

6. Science Station Two

Two computer terminals are located here for the scientists to record their findings. With computer skill one might be able to hack into this system with a modified roll of 11 or higher. In the event of success a disk could be burned with research data sufficient for the needs of the corporation.

## Deck Level Four

![[AntStat-04.jpg|100]]
[[AntStat-04.jpg|Deck Level Four]]

This deck is the hanger bay for small craft used by the crew. Two unarmed pinnaces are located here. One has been modified with a sprayer for testing chemical weapons on the planet below.

Two dead bodies lie on the hanger bay floor. Both were engineers. Both appear to have died from gunshot wounds.

The Pinnace with the sprayer is empty but not operational. It appears to have been sabotaged. Someone has intentionally damaged all of the controls and control panels.

The other Pinnace has a crew member aboard it. This crew member is the station captain who is also now insane. He is armed with a revolver and has used it several times already. He has been having hallucinations and believes that everyone is out to kill him. He will attack anyone that he sees.

```

```

He has a revolver with him and will use it despite the risks of creating a breach in the hull. Each shot fired within the station has a chance of creating a hull breach which would be catastrophic to the station and it’s inhabitants. A roll of 12 on 2D6 will indicate such a breach. A roll should be made for every shot taken that misses flesh.

The bodies of two research scientists are stored in the rear compartment of the pinnace. A third scientist is also located there and is barely alive. With proper medical treatment he could survive. If taken to the medical bay one with medical skill could save this scientist with a modified roll of
7 or higher.

# Hull Breaches

If a hull breach takes place the ship will begin quickly losing oxygen and pressure. These levels will no longer be life sustaining aboard the station after fifteen minutes. One had better evacuate before that time or be wearing a vacc suit.

## Conditions For Success

There are a number of deadly hazards aboard this station. At a minimum the company will pay for a visit to the station and a report that a chemical exposure has taken place and that the inhabitants are dead. But the company will pay bonuses for other objectives met as defined earlier. These bonus payments are as follows:

```
CR 25000 For a report on the status of the station
CR 10000 For research data from the science division on the station
CR 10000 Per crew member or scientist brought back alive
```

Patron Emanuel Steward will be located at the same planet where he hired the travelers for this mission.
