> Small merchant ships are a common sight in Known Space and the Zhodani have their share of traders plying the spacelanes even if they're less well known to the Imperials. One such crew has their work cut out for them to make their way in District 268 where they'll never be quite sure of their reception at the next world.

# Introduction

District 268 is an attractive subsector for the Zhodani to explore and into which to extend their influence. There are worlds ripe for development, there are unaligned worlds to persuade that the Third Imperium might not be the best ally, there are various minor races perhaps more sympathetic to the psionic masters, and there are Imperial worlds far from the mainstreams which can be visited and observed. Entering the area an experienced and skilled group of traders are beginning to feel their way.

This adventure is designed for four to six PCs playing Zhodani with psionic abilities. Some skill specialities have not been specified and these can be selected by the players. Generous Referees may allow the specialities to be chosen during the adventure at point of need and then be fixed thereafter. To run the adventure you will need Mongoose Publishing's _Core Rulebook_ 2 nd Edition and are strongly advised to have _Alien Module 4: Zhodani_ available as well – although some small adjustments are necessary between that 1st Edition volume and the 2nd Edition rules. _The Spinward Marches_ would be useful and as usual more generic volumes such as _Supplement 4: Central Supply Catalogue_ and _Supplement 13: Starport Encounters_ can be handy. World descriptions from wiki.travellerrpg.com have been used to flesh out some of the details of locations the PCs will visit, in particular Dawnworld and Noctocol. Jump maps are courtesy of [http://www.travellermap.com.](http://www.travellermap.com.)

'Acceptance' figures for worlds in the District (Appendix 5) are taken from the Cultural section of Traveller5 's UWP Extension (also available from <http://www.travellermap.com>). These give a rough idea of how welcoming a population might be to off-worlders and foreigners. Alternatively, the Referee can simply invent attitudes – or use reaction tables – to gauge the reception of the Zhodani on various worlds.

The aim of this adventure is to connect, loosely, with Three Blind Mice published by 13Mann, and to that end the Referee may wish to have a copy of that to hand. It is freely available from: <http://www.13mann.com/index.php/en/download/category/>
52 - traveller-adventures or <http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/125902/Traveller-Adventure-Three-Blind-Mice> (registration required).

One of the PCs listed on the following pages should be selected as, or choose to be, the survivor of the Shinchoddia Massacre referred to in the Library Data and the Prologue of Three Blind Mice. It is possible for any of them to have been on the scene, although Stiekliepr and Brabrkliepr would be at the upper range of what's possible being around 15 at the start of the Fourth Frontier War if the massacre happened early on. Other characters might be more suitably younger at the time. Typically, Zhodani healing measures should leave any such traumatised children whole and well-balanced, but of course it is always possible that any such conditioning is breaking down or wasn't very effective in the first place. The Referee should discuss with the relevant player how much or how little they wish to make of this – particularly given that the PCs are a long way from home and the usual kind of support they would expect.

Not everything in this adventure revolves around psionics and the Referee can add other events as desired to balance events as appropriate. However, bear in mind that from the Zhodani point of view everything _does_ revolve around psionics as they are such a fundamental part of life. Each of the PCs has been given an 'issue' which they can choose to ignore, role play or deal with via any Tavrchedl' they might encounter.

Although this adventure doesn't include a meeting between the selected survivor of the massacre and the Imperial veteran from the crew of The Application of Credit , the intention is that this would feature in a subsequent adventure involving both sets of crew – or at least portions of both crews if the adventure was being played by, for example, six players at a convention. In such a case, the remaining crew will become NPCs. If the Referee wishes to speed up this meeting, there is no reason it couldn't happen during or at the end of events described here. The whole connection can be ignored if preferred in any case.

_Background_ : Zoviepr is army through and through having been brought up in a military family, joined cadet forces as soon as she was able, and having served in the Infantry for eight years followed by a further eight years in the cavalry. Rising to the NCO rank of Leader of 50, Zoviepr commands respect both physically and for her abilities. She's seen action in urban war zones, undergone commando training twice, but ultimately failed to make the Guards she'd hoped to join which still rankles under the surface. This is despite typical Zhodani conditioning. Skilled with a variety of weapons including telekinesis, she serves as gunner and general cargo dogsbody on board the _Zarvae'_.

You've studied some of the finer points of Tavrziansh and always had a copy of the Fevranzhtavr [The Book of Morality] with you on deployment. However, over the last chten [year] you've been having waking dreams that you think may be the memories of a former spirit intruding on your own. You probably ought to report it to the Tavrchedl' but you didn't want to miss out on the opportunity to serve on this mission and so far from the Consulate the usual oversight is absent. Meanwhile, over the last shidr [season] you've been growing closer to the doctor, Zanzhzhiepr and you think the feeling is mutual.

_Goals for the mission_ :

- report on general state of District 268, any Imperial presence and the general acceptance or otherwise of psionics
- report on ship movements and starport conditions
- promote psionic powers and well-being, exemplifying Tavrziansh
- personally, you'd like to impress Kiazbratl, the only noble aboard, enough that he takes you on as his personal assistant and have heard the nightside lights of the domed cities of Forine are a spectacle worth seeing

### Stiekliepr Steward/Captain

A68A2A-B, Age 38, 5 terms, Merchants: Free Trader (3 terms) & Merchants: Corporate (2 terms) Rank 4: 2nd Officer _Characteristics_ : STR 10 (+1), DEX6 (+0), END8 (+0), INT 10 (+1), EDU2 (-2), SOC 10 (+1), PSI 11 (+1)
_Homeworld_ : Ifsenja Siakr A677532-D Ag Ga Ht Ni Cap (Ziafrplians 0403)

_Skills_ : **Clairvoyance 2,** Steward 2, Admin 1, Animals (any) 1, Engineer (M-drive) 1, Engineer (power) 1, Gun Combat (any) 1, Gunner (screen) 1, Language (Galanglic) 1, Mechanic 1, Pilot (small craft) 1, **Telepathy 1 ,** Broker 0, Drive (any) 0, Electronics (comms) 0, **Mimic 0,** Persuade 0, **Teleportation 0,** Vacc Suit 0 _Equipment_ : Cr50,000, 5 ship shares, Nenjchinzhe'driante, Weapon

_Background_ : Stiekliepr hasn't seen his homeworld in some two decades having travelled for all of his adult life. At home in busy metropoli or quiet rural backwaters, starships or groundside, high society or low, the merchant has a variety of skills picked up along the way and has the best clairvoyant skill amongst the crew of the _Zarvae'_. A skilled administrator, Stiekliepr acts as purser and chief steward but is willing to get his hands dirty particularly if a cargo of live animals is the order of the day as he some experience from a livestock freighter in his past.

In your twenties you were involved in a serious grav vehicle accident which left you physically unharmed save for some bruising, but mentally quite shocked. The Tavrchedl' dealt with this promptly with a short period of re-education but a recent close shave in a grav vehicle has brought back the nightmares. You probably ought to report it to the Tavrchedl' but you didn't want to miss out on the opportunity to serve on this mission and so far from the Consulate the usual oversight is absent.

_Goals for the mission_ :

- report on general state of District 268, any Imperial presence and the general acceptance or otherwise of psionics
- report on ship movements and starport conditions
- promote psionic powers and well-being, exemplifying Tavrziansh
- personally, you'd like to impress Kiazbratl, the only noble aboard, enough that he takes you on as his personal assistant and you have an aunt on Noctocol you've not seen in years and feel you ought to visit

### Zanzhzhiepr Doctor

9A8AAA-8, Age 30, 3 terms, Scholar: Researcher (1 term) & Scholar: Physician (2 terms) Rank 3 _Characteristics_ : STR9 (+1), DEX 10 (+1), END8 (+0), INT 10 (+1), EDU 10 (+1), SOC 10 (+1), PSI8 (+0)
_Homeworld_ : Freqsteblmedr B541644-A Ni Po (Ziafrplians 0630)

_Skills_ : Medic 3, Art (any) 1, Investigate 1, Language (Galanglic) 1, Science (any) 1, Science (any) 1, Survival 1,
**Telekinesis 1,** Admin 0, Animals (any) 0, Carouse 0, **Clairvoyance 0,** Diplomat 0, Drive (any) 0, Electronics (computers) 0, **Empathic Healing 0,** Science (any) 0, Science (any) 0, **Telepathy 0**
_Equipment_ : Cr30,000, Scientific Equipment

_Background_ : Zanzhzhiepr is not quite the youngest and least experienced of the crew of the _Zarvae'_ but more than makes up for it with the medical skills she brings to the ship which have served them well in the past. She is known for her interests in both science and art, starting out as a researcher but on the death of her husband at the age of 21 transferring to the medical branch of her university. Here she made a breakthrough in the application of microkinetic manipulation of damaged tissue in the healing process which transformed blunt trauma injury diagnosis and rehabilitation. Zanzhzhiepr also acts as chef aboard.
(See note _Alien Module 4: Zhodani_ , page 6 on Carouse skill for the Zhodani)

Married at 17, your husband's death when you were 21 was a traumatic event which the Tavrchedl' dealt with efficiently with a period of re-education. The loss becoming a part of your inner strength that has made what you are today - a skilled and sympathetic doctor. Over the last shidr, however, you've been growing close to Zoviepr, the handsome and well-educated weapon's officer and gunner aboard. This has reawakened guilt and sorrow from your past. You probably ought to report it to the Tavrchedl' but you didn't want to miss out on the opportunity to serve on this mission and so far from the Consulate the usual oversight is absent.

_Goals for the mission_ :

- report on general state of District 268, any Imperial presence and the general acceptance or otherwise of psionics
- report on ship movements and starport conditions
- promote psionic powers and well-being, exemplifying Tavrziansh
- personally, you'd like to impress Kiazbratl, the only noble aboard, enough that he takes you on as his personal assistant and you'd like to visit the domed city of Jaffne which you've read about being a cultural and architectural jewel on Elixabeth

### Brabrkliepr Engineer/Gunner

776C8A-D, Age 38, 5 terms, Navy: Technical (2 terms) & Merchant: Broker (1 term) & Merchant: Free Trader (
terms) Rank 3: 3rd Officer _Characteristics_ : STR7 (+0), DEX7 (+0), END6 (+0), INT 12 (+2), EDU8 (+0), SOC 10 (+1), PSI 13 (+2)
_Homeworld_ : Iashiedr B878857-7 Ga (Ziafrplians 0221)

_Skills_ : Broker 3, Engineer (J-drive) 3 , **Awareness 2,** Gun Combat (any) 2, Athletics (any) 1, Engineer (life support) 1, Engineer (power) 1, Language (Galanglic) 1, Mechanic 1, Persuade 1, Vacc Suit 1, Advocate 0, Animals (any) 0, Athletics (endurance) 0, **Blocking 0,** Electronics (comms) 0, Gun Combat (any) 0, Gunner (turret) 0, Medic 0, Pilot (any) 0, **Telepathy 0**
_Equipment_ : 2 ship shares, Nenjchinzhe'driante, Weapon, Enemy

_Background_ : Brabrkliepr is one of the most experienced of the crew of the _Zarvae'_ and in space acts as chief engineer, whilst in port he acts as the ship's broker aboard. Following a stint in the navy which he enjoyed, Brabrkliepr became a merchant which he has found suits him, well, down to the ground. He has the highest psionic strength of all the crew and the highest Awareness – although the meditative trances he sometimes enters can be long enough and deep enough to give his crewmates cause for concern.

As a result of losing your wife and unborn child a decade ago due to complications in labour, you have a sadness in your past which the Tavrchedl' kept at bay with regular re-education sessions. You were officially signed off any further need for these nearly a thequzdij [olympiad] ago. However, this journey away from the Consulate has brought those feelings to the surface once again and you are struggling to deal with them. You probably ought to report it to the Tavrchedl' but you don't want to miss out on the opportunity to serve on this mission and so far from the Consulate the usual oversight is absent.

_Goals for the mission_ :

- report on general state of District 268, any Imperial presence and the general acceptance or otherwise of psionics
- report on ship movements and starport conditions
- promote psionic powers and well-being, exemplifying Tavrziansh
- personally, you'd like to impress Kiazbratl, the only noble aboard, enough that he takes you on as his personal assistant and you'd like to get a sight of an Imperial Jump drive if it's ever possible as you understand there are some subtle differences in how they function.

### Chenchapriepr Pilot/Steward

696CAA-B, Age 28, 2.5 terms, Merchant: Corporate (2 complete terms) Rank 2: 4th Officer _Characteristics_ : STR6 (+0), DEX9 (+1), END6 (+0), INT 12 (+2), EDU 10 (+1), SOC 10 (+1), PSI 11 (+1)
_Homeworld_ : Divriafliadr E250836-4 De Po (Tienspevnekr 0915)

_Skills_ : Pilot (spacecraft) 2, Electronics (comms) 1, Gun Combat (any) 1, Language (Galanglic) 1, Mechanic 1, Steward 1,
**Telekinesis 1,** Animals (any) 0, Broker 0, **Clairvoyance 0,** Drive (any) 0, Persuade 0, Science (any) 0, Survival 0,
**Telepathy 0,** Vacc Suit 0 _Equipment_ : Cr2000, Nenj, Ally

_Background_ : Chenchapriepr is the pilot of the _Zarvae'_ and the youngest crew member with just two and a bit terms in the Merchants after being asked to leave the career for “business reasons” his former Captain and employers told him. He regards the payoff he got, Cr2000, as completely inadequate for the service he'd put in. Chenchapriepr also acts as a steward when duties permit to assist Stiekliepr with the numbers of passengers the _Zarvae'_ might carry.

As a child, you were the one survivor of the Shinchoddia Massacre [see Library Data]. Careful and caring Tavrchedl'
re-education following the event has enabled you to put that behind you. However, you are recognizing that your treatment at the hands of a former employer is growing into a resentment that life doesn't treat you fairly and perhaps Tavrziansh isn't a path you wish to follow. You probably ought to report this to the Tavrchedl' but you didn't want to miss out on the opportunity to serve on this mission and so far from the Consulate the usual oversight is absent.

_Goals for the mission_ :

- report on general state of District 268, any Imperial presence and the general acceptance or otherwise of psionics
- report on ship movements and starport conditions
- promote psionic powers and well-being, exemplifying Tavrziansh
- personally, you'd like to impress Kiazbratl, the only noble aboard, enough that he takes you on as his personal assistant and you're keen to try out your Galanglic language skills which there hasn't been much opportunity for in the Sword Worlds Confederation

### Kiazbratl (“Aspirant”) Astrogator

9549DB-B, Age 34, 4 terms, Merchants: Broker (4 terms) Rank 4 _Characteristics_ : STR9 (+1), DEX5 (-1), END4 (-1), INT9 (+1), EDU 13 (+2), SOC 11 (+1), PSI 11 (+1)
_Homeworld_ : Jrbrianch B79A454-D Wa Ni (Zhodane 0610)

_Skills_ : Advocate 2, Astrogation 2, Language (Galanglic) 2 , Broker 1, Gun Combat (any) 1, Investigate 1, Persuade 1,
**Teleprojection 1,** Art (any) 0, Drive (any) 0, Electronics (comms) 0, Profession (butcher) 0, Profession (any) 0, Science (any) 0, Seafarer (any) 0, Steward 0 **, Telepathy 0,** Vacc Suit 0 _Equipment_ : Cr25,000, ship share, Weapon

_Background_ : Kiazbratl is the only Aspirant amongst a crew of Intendants and as such is often seen as leader of the group. He's also the furthest from home in terms of homeworld, hailing from Jrbrianch in Zhodane sector. Kiazbratl acts as astrogater for the _Zarvae'_ and is acutely aware that he's the only one with that skill aboard which he thinks is a concern. He thinks Zanzhzhiepr would be the most suitable candidate to understudy him. That he's attracted to her as well is by-the-by. Kiazbratl supports Brabrkliepr in his brokerage duties when required. He served on the _Shienbar_ merchant ship which became extremely well-known in the Dashipr sector of Zhodane serving a very selective route.

For unknown reasons which you think are medical but at least some doctors you've spoken to think may be all in your mind, you have lost a significant psionic skill that you once had [your choice what it was]. As a diligent and community minded noble you made sure you underwent thorough re-education sessions with the Tavrchedl' to deal with the unexpected loss. However, this whole journey, perhaps exacerbated by some of the anti-Zhodani attitudes you and your crew have encountered, has brought resentment, anger and frustration to the fore and you want answers. You probably ought to report it to the Tavrchedl' but you don't want to miss out on the opportunity to serve on this mission or fail the Intendants who depend on you, and so far from the Consulate the usual oversight is absent.

_Goals for the mission_ :

- report on general state of District 268, any Imperial presence and the general acceptance or otherwise of psionics
- report on ship movements and starport conditions
- promote psionic powers and well-being, exemplifying Tavrziansh
- you don't currently have a personal assistant from amongst the ranks of Intendants as is traditional for a Zhodani noble, but with five Intendants accompanying you on the ship, you've been able to draw on all of their services of the last few shidr [seasons], playing each off against the other as they vie for a position with you after the mission and you've always wanted to try your hand at hunting wildlife and think this might be an opportunity.

**Talent Package**
If the Referee desires to have something similar to the skill packages to divide amongst the PCs, this can be used:

**Zhodani psionic Talent package** : For campaigns or adventures where the characters are Zhodani with psionic powers [divide all but one of these amongst the PCs]

Aura Perception 1, Energy Kinesis 1, Healing 1, Personal Enhancement 1, Projection 1 , Psionic Attack 1, Psionic Defence 1, Tapping 1, Teleportation 1

(Additional skills are from Book 4: Psion , Alien Module 4: Zhodani , Compendium 1 and Freelance Traveller no.56)

**Leadership**
The players should decide who is captaining the ship to suit themselves. It could reasonably be Kiazbratl with the highest social standing and position in their society, Zoviepr with the only leadership skill amongst them, Stiekliepr as the highest-ranking merchant on the crew (slightly senior to Kiazbratl, also rank 4, thanks to age),

Brabrkliepr as the best skilled broker perhaps or either of the other two if they wish to argue the case!  However, once the players have come to a decision, the PCs would typically accept the decision due to the harmonious nature of their society.

**Societal norms**
It might also help players with their motivations and characterization to have the following text to hand:

Intendants and Nobles ( _Alien Module 4: Zhodani_ , p.40)
Privacy of thought is highly respected by Intendants and Nobles as their greatest freedom; Proles have no such rights. Nobles have an almost complete right of privacy and Intendants nearly as much, in either case, it can only be breached if there is a suspicion (in the case of an Intendant) or clear proof (for a Noble) that the individual is guilty of aberrant thought.

In other ways, Intendants have less freedom than Proles do. Membership in this class carries a precondition of service: Intendants are expected to be engaged in socially acceptable work under the close supervision of the Nobility (at least until their retirement). Soon after reaching adulthood an Intendant will select a career path and will generally remain in that career until either retirement (and a pension) or successful promotion to the Nobility. Retired Intendants have somewhat more freedom and usually end up raising a family, taking up travel or becoming involved in hobbies or personal business pursuits.

Nobles are, to a large degree, as free as any Imperial citizen is. They have the right to vote or hold office, and are free to travel and do as they wish provided they obey Consular laws. Those who choose to enter military service or join a government agency will, of course, be expected to obey their superior officers.

# Act One

The PCs are the crew of a _Zdebr_- class Trader, the _Zarvae'_ [Sparkling Way] (see _Alien Module 4: Zhodani_ pages, 96- 97 for details of the ship and deck plans). The ship is a 200 - ton general purpose merchant with Jump 2 and Maneuver 1. She has 104 - tons of cargo space in three holds, 16 staterooms and 32 low berths. There is a Ship's Boat on the hanger deck. Monthly Maintenance is Cr99,000 and Monthly Life Support is Cr35,000. The ship is good condition although Stateroom 13's artificial gravity plates have failed and there's clearly something wrong with some fibre optics in the bulkhead at the forward end of the Common Room as the psionic switches of the iris valves have failed. Brabrkliepr has rigged physical switches and is still working on the grav plates. Stateroom 5 has been converted into a medbay for Zanzhzhiepr. The hull has a disturbing way of creaking and groaning when in space although it is structurally sound. It reminds Kiazbratl of oceangoing ships from his homeworld.

The _Zarvae'_ is owned by a small company which the Consulate has asked to arrange the mission. To that end the company has employed the crew at 1.5 times standard rates due the nature and duration of their trip with the expectation that they will make regular reports on conditions, shipping movement, trading opportunities and so on. The six have been selected for their mix of skills and some limited ability in Galanglic commonly spoken throughout District 268. They're expected to pay their way in terms of covering the monthly maintenance and life support. Once those costs have been covered, any speculative trade they might carry out is theirs to divide between themselves as they see fit with 10% going to the company. The 104-ton hold currently has 20 tons of common consumables, 20 tons of common ore, 10 tons of polymers, 3 tons of wood and 1 ton of spices securely stowed in its three cargo bays. One ton of the polymers are biodegradable tripolymers which can be sold for twice the usual price on any world with an atmospheric taint which can use it as part of filtration systems.

“You set off from Querion and have spent nearly 4 shidr [seasons] (some 24 weeks) in transit across Tloql [The Spinward Marches]. You have just passed through the Sword Worlds on your way to explore District 268 and the trade opportunities that might be there. You've seen some of the wonders the Sword Worlds have to offer, you've learned a word or two of Sagamaal (seks [six], rumhamn [starport] and vaen [friend, ally] for example) and of course you visited the famous psionic institute on Gram. Although the building was impressive, the facilities seemed rather limited and there was a preponderance of females staffing the place which felt unusual on the Sword Worlds. Atchafser [waning] has turned to Ataniebl [harvest] while you were in Jump. Having Jumped from Steel[^1] to Dawnworld (Spinward Marches 1531 E885000-0 Ba Ga), the subsector lies before you and decisions need to be made about what to do and where to go next.”

[^1]:  Although Steel's UWP is given as E655000-0 in _The Spinward Marches_ , _Sword Worlds_ and at travellermap.com, _Sword Worlds_ has a text write up that gives a population of 4300, captive rule government and a tech level of 8. The Referee should decide which numbers to use and adapt any description of where the PCs have come from and any activities they may have carried out accordingly.

## Scene 1: Refuelling

First, however, refuelling is necessary in order to be able to Jump onwards. This can be carried out at one of the five gas giants in the system or on the surface of the planet in any number of places. The PCs can choose which they prefer.

**Refuelling at the giant**
If the PCs choose to refuel at one of the gas giants, and there are five to choose from, they will encounter a _Sleipnir_ - class Confederation Patroller (see _Sword Worlds_ , pages 90-93) which is also refuelling. The Sword Worlds claim the planet and although they've not yet solved the mystery of the sterility that plagues the world, they maintain an interest in who is visiting the world and why. They won't be aggressive towards the Zhodani traders but the captain, Karl Sellevoid, may ask some detailed questions and won't accept a refusal to answer which will simply make them suspicious. Polite and forthcoming, the PCs should have no problem refuelling and Jumping out – they may even be able to trade information and insults about the Imperials. As they've just come through Sword World space they may be able to mention names that will put the Patrol at ease. Appendix 3 shows the route the PCs took across the Sword Worlds to help answer any questions.

**Karl Sellevoid**
959759 , male, Age 26, Confederation Patrol: Patrol, Rank 4: Seniorsergent (old style: Oberleutnant)
_Characteristics_ : STR9 (+1), DEX5 (-1), END9 (+1), INT7 (+0), EDU5 (-1), SOC9 (+1)
_Homeworld_ : Sacnoth A775956-C Hi In (Spinward Marches 1325)
_Skills_ : Diplomacy 2, Astrogation 1, Engineer (electronics) 1, Gun Combat (any) 1, Persuade 1, Pilot (spacecraft) 1, Admin 0, Electronics (computers) 0 , Engineer (life support) 0, Mechanic 0, Pilot (small craft) 0, Streetwise 0, Vacc Suit 0 _Equipment_ : Weapon, Rival
[Appendix 4 gives an older version of Karl after he's mustered out for potential use as a PC.]

If the PCs bypass the gas giants in favor of refuelling on the ground, this encounter could still take place either as they leave Dawnworld orbit, or head out to the Jump limit.

**Refuelling on the ground**
Dawnworld is a beautiful garden world but there is no population. The Zhodani might be curious why. Library Data entries should give them the background which has been known for the last five centuries or more. The Darrians, the Sacnoth Dominate, Imperial utopians and Vargr have all tried to set up colonies in the last two thousand years, but all have encountered the same problem: any males born on the planet are sterile. None of the colonies have lasted more than fifty years. The PCs will be unlikely to stumble across the solution to this in the short amount of time that they're there, but it would be safe enough to visit the surface, stretch their legs and refuel.

The PCs can essentially put down wherever they wish. There's an obvious lake which could easily be used to refuel. The task will take at least three people. Large grazing herds can be seen on the lush grasslands beside the water and if they're watched for long enough, an avian predator might be seen attacking one of the young herd beasts. They'll generally stay away from the PCs, however. For refuelling, a Routine ( 6 +) Engineer skill check should be made with any failure causing a delay in the operation which will take 1D hours + 3. If it takes longer than five hours, one of the avians will become bold enough to attack a PC.

**Dawnflyer**
Dawnflyers are sharp-eyed raptors which will opportunistically try to pick off prey that looks weak. The listed speed is for horizontal flight, they can dive at greater speeds: 250m in a combat round.

## Scene 2: Filling the cargo space

There are obviously no trade goods to be had on Dawnworld for purchase, but if the PCs wish to spend the time, they could herd up live animals such as the grazers which they could ship to a future destination. It will be a Difficult (10+) Animals task check (1D hours) to round them up, but for every hour spent successfully allow two tons of stock. The base price for sale would be Cr10,000 as per the _Core Rulebook_. Alternatively, they could hunt for meat and once again the grazers would be easy targets. An Average ( 8 +) Gun Combat (1D hours, DEX) task is needed and will give six tons per hour but for a fifth the base price sale value. Failure represents injury in either the hunting or the herding.

Non-meat products could be gathered – such as wood, plants or spices. For wood this involves an Easy (4+)
Intelligence check and will allow 10 tons/hour of wood to be gathered. Bubblewood is a little harder to find and harder to collect so an Average (8+) task allows 8 tons/hour. For spice it is an Average ( 8 +) check and allows 2 tons/hour of spice to be collected. Fruit is a Simple (2+) check for items that would sell as Common Consumables and a Difficult (10+) check for pieces that would sell as Luxury Consumables. Failure represents collecting substandard material which will reduce the price by 1d6%.

There is 50 tons of cargo space available although the passenger staterooms are empty if PCs wanted to use them for, say, temporary fruit or spice storage. This may involve the stewards having to deal with complaints about any smell subsequently.

An unusual tree found in the subtropical areas of Dawnworld. _Bulla aurora_ is an extremely lightweight, but very strong wood which can be used for building, shipping, shelving and decoration. The trees have a distinctive shape and a purple tinge which makes them easy to identify. It's distinctive grain and limited availability makes it highly sought after for decorative purposes amongst the wealthy.

Unless the players have no interest in the finer economics of their trade mission, this table should not be presented as is but the PCs should be given sufficient information to work out what they'd prefer to do trading off difficulty, time spent and potential Credits. Note that with herd animals the crew could not completely fill the remaining hold with this weight directly as pens and foodstuffs would need to be included in any such cargo. The Referee should introduce further animal or perhaps vicious plant encounters at least every six hours but more often if desired.

## Scene 3: Moving on

The table below and map to the right shows all the worlds of interest within Jump 2 of Dawnworld:

Worlds within Jump 2 of Dawnworld 1331 Datrillian E427633-8 Ni 1 332 Nirton X500000-0 Ba Va RED 1532 Elixabeth B426467-8 Ni (colony of Dallia 1435)
1 533 Forine D3129B8-A Hi Ic In NA 16 31 Talchek C7B1442-8 Fl He NI Da 16 32 Milagro E31178A-7 Ic NA Pi

The PCs should be given a free hand in choosing their destination but might note that Forine, with its High Population and Industrial trade codes would give them a slight premium if they've gathered spices or wood. This also takes them further into the District which is their aim.

The players should be aware of Nirton's status as an interdicted mineral reserve awaiting development. The red zone only allows them to refuel at the one gas giant and then move on. Talchek is an amber zone due to its highly corrosive atmosphere and the difficulties of travelling and working there.

The Referee can elide over the time in Jumpspace or give the players opportunities to get to know each of the characters aboard with the understanding that the crew have travelled with each other for some time and know each other well.

# Act Two

These scenes can be handled in any order after the first. They are also optional after the first scene and give the PCs a flavor of both life in District 268 and the varying attitudes to psionics generally and Zhodani specifically.

## Scene 1: Out and about in District 268

At whatever destination they choose the Referee should specify what other ships are arriving in system and departing – particularly noting any military vessels, what ships are present in the system and any other activity that would be of interest to the Consulate. On arrival at the planet the usual merchant activities of selling and buying cargo can be carried out as per the _Core Rulebook_. Whether the crew wish to use their psionic skills to give them an edge is entirely up to them. Some potential tasks are suggested below but others may be thought up by the players. _Detecting a merchant's 'final' price during bartering_ :
Average (8+) Telepathy, PSI, 1D x 10 seconds. Reach: Long. Costs 2 _Remotely viewing opposing negotiators' private discussions_ : Average (8+) Clairvoyance, PSI, 1D minutes. Reach: Very Distant. Costs 1 _Adjusting a TL6-8 computer system's cargo price_ : Very Difficult (12+) Telekinesis, PSI, 1D x 10 seconds. Reach: Close. Costs 3. Increase the Difficulty level by one for TL9-10 computers. [This is harder than simply sabotaging a computer system as given in the examples for Microkinesis.]
_Concentrating on numerous complex factors regarding a trade negotiation_ : Average (8+) Awareness, PSI, 1D seconds. Reach: n/a. DM increase. Success adds +
as per Broker skill. Spectacular success adds +3.

**A cargo of mlok**
One cargo will find the PCs. Essy Marlinquen will track down the PCs and be delighted to see them. “I've been hoping some such as yourselves would pass through. Would you be heading towards Dallia by any chance?”
[Referee's Note: In fact, it could be any world with a reasonably sized population to support a university or similar research institute in the direction the Referee wishes to guide the players. Dallia takes the PCs further into District 268 and an eventual meeting with the crew of The Application of Credit – see the note in the Introduction.]

“I've got a cargo I'd like taken that way and I can't trust it to just any old freightlines. Seeing as how you're Zhodani, I thought you might be willing to help. I can pay.” And Essy will indeed pay three times the going rate to take four tons of salamander-like creatures with small horns and a ridged back (about 30 animals in all, in a large terrarium which makes up much of the weight) to a named Institution on Dallia. Perhaps the Diet of Dallia which is the best regarded university on the world and has some cachet within District 268. “They're called mlok. They don't need much care, you just need to top up their water tank each day and put one of their refrigerated food pots in with them. They're all included.” She will almost certainly go on to explain why these are special and why they need to get to Dallia.
“You see, we've been doing some research on them and we think they may capture their prey psionically. We've ruled out just about everything else. But we don't really have the facilities here to investigate that. The Dallians do.”

The terrarium can be made of transparent aluminium if desired or can be simple box shaped structure without sides which can be seen through; one end is formed of a water tank which feeds the terrarium and a refrigerated unit which holds food pots for a month or so.

**Mlok**
Mlok are 20cm long salamander-like creatures which live in water margins. They have small 'horns' and smooth skin (except for a ridged back) in a wide variety of bright colours. Mlok is both the singular and the plural form and 3d6 of them might ordinarily be encountered.

If she's questioned further Essy can explain that:

- they (her small college department), don't understand the psionic mechanism,
- the creatures are native to whatever world they're on,
- they're completely harmless, (“We've never had any trouble with them.”)
- the food is insect and frog eggs which will hatch out when warmed to room temperature and give the creatures live prey to consume
- she doesn't trust ordinary traders who, if they knew the creatures were potentially psionic, might take against them.

“You don't expose your cargo bay to vacuum, do you?”
She suddenly thinks. “That wouldn't be good.” She understands that the university or institute on Dallia has a small department with the abilities to look into this.
“Maybe you could help them?” Essy will be full of enthusiasm for the science of it all and a better understanding of a psionic animal which is unheard of amongst the fauna of the world and unusual anywhere.

The PCs are of course free to decline the cargo if they wish, although they'll be missing out on an opportunity to further psionic knowledge – not to mention the cash. Essy can be bargained up another 10% if pressed. She will be extremely disappointed if the crew say no but accept that she must look elsewhere.

Aside from Essy, the Referee should decide on the world's attitude to psions generally and Zhodani in particular. This may affect their trading opportunities and/or the prices they are charged or offered, although it should be noted that outside of the Imperium feelings may vary depending on the individuals encountered rather than being globally identical. Passengers will be available as usual (see page 209 of the Core Rulebook )
although there may be difficulties finding passengers willing to travel with Zhodani. Those passengers that there are, with little other choice, may be more than a little concerned about travelling with those they assume to be psions. Of course, there may be the curious as well who want to see 'tricks'. See page 33 for some potential passengers. There will be one person in particular looking for passage to the next world, March Warden Jasie Feffrim.

She's been operating in District 268 for the last four years and has alternative ID as a TAS journalist, Martcha Zipramesk. Feffrim actually spent a year as an intern in a TAS office and can carry off this deception with some skill. Her apparent Social Standing with this cover is 8. Outside of the Third Imperium, she is much more likely to be using her cover persona.

_Detecting a March Warden's ID is false_ : Formidable (14+)
INT or EDU, 1D minutes. (Deception skill can be used as an additional DM on this task.)

_Detecting a March Warden's cover story is false_ : Difficult (10+) Telepathy, PSI, 1D x 10 seconds. Reach: Short. Cost: 2.

Jasie will present to the Zhodani crew as Zipramesk and pay for an ordinary mid passage. She is not checking up on the crew for any specific reason but she will take an interest in Zhodani this far out of the Consulate. If she's likely to be bumped by a high passage paying passenger, her interest in the Zhodani will be sufficient that she will bump up her own payment to high passage. If the PCs are incautious about their interest in, for example, military shipping movements in front of the passengers, this will cause Jasie to step up her interest in the crew. If, because of their activities or any proselytization of human controlled worlds, she sees them as a more serious threat to the Imperium her reports on them will become that much more detailed. But she would be unlikely to act directly and should generally just be treated as another paying passenger. If the PCs do uncover her real identity she will be completely straight with them about who she is and her curiosity to see what they were about. She may be treating it as a test to see how able the Zhodani are because she has a request in mind for them (see the closing paragraph of this adventure). Her identity as a March Warden is not a deep secret, just not something she bandies about casually. Alternatively, the Referee could have her using some form of high tech psionic shield – perhaps an intricately woven headscarf.

Data One activity the PCs will wish to carry on this world, and subsequent worlds that they visit, will be the preparation of a data package containing their own movements and any observations they've made regarding shipping, trading conditions, world data which differs from standard Library Data notes, and any other information they feel might be of interest. They'll then need to get this data package to – in order of preference

- any Zhodani ship heading back to the Consulate, any Zhodani embassy that might be present on the world (for onward shipment to the Consulate when possible), or the highest social standing Zhodani they can find locally (again, for onward shipment as and when possible).

Lynching Before departure local news from one of the provinces of the world, or perhaps another world, moon or space station in the system, will carry a story about the trial of someone accused of attacking a young woman psionically. The trial is coming to an end and the mood in the locale will be ugly with crowds gathering and baying for blood. Depending on the law level of the world, the Referee should determine what the media reports are estimating the likely sentence is going to be. There seems little doubt of the defendant's guilt. Law Level 9 and above (i.e. Milagro) will have execution as the maximum penalty, Law Level 4 -8 (Elixabeth or Forine) will have a psionic lobotomy as the penalty, usually presented positively as medical treatment to help the victim “get better”, and lower law levels (Datrillian or Talchek) will have lengthy periods of incarceration. If the Referee wishes to save this incident until later and another world, these numbers will give an indication of sentences that might be applied elsewhere. Whatever the judicial sentence, it may be that the mob takes matters into their own hands. If there is any Zhodani presence on the world, the Referee will need to decide on their involvement or lack of involvement in the case. It might be someone with psionic powers administering any court ordered lobotomy or it may be a much cruder medical procedure.

It is entirely up to the PCs whether they treat this as simply an event that is going on around them and which gives them an idea of the atmosphere and potential dangers of the District, or whether they wish to get involved either diplomatically or more directly. Discussions by the PCs might revolve around the ethics of leaving him, attempting to persuade the authorities to release him into their care, or rescuing him and the difficulty of doing so. If more direct action is taken, the Referee may wish to prepare details of and plans for a local gaol and/or courthouse from which the defendant can be extricated. Depending on the tech level of the world this may be easier or more difficult. It may be a large penitentiary or a small lockup depending on the interests of the players. However, low tech level worlds shouldn't be treated as a pushover and may either have some ingenious low tech holding methods, have imported higher technology, or be able to employ large numbers of guards. Jump 2 from Dawnworld everywhere except Nirton is mid-tech. The defendant's name is Stinford Glass.

**Stinford Glass** C69443-9, Age 22, Unemployed _Characteristics_ : STR 12 (+2), DEX6 (+0), END9 (+1), INT4 (-1), EDU4 (-1), SOC3 (-1), PSI9 (+1)
_Skills_ : Carouse 0, Profession (construction) 0 _Background_ : Glass is an uneducated, unemployed victim of his upbringing in the slums by parents who struggled with education as well. He is unaware of any psionic ability but did attack his girlfriend although the court case, which has left him somewhat bewildered, centered around whether this was deliberately premeditated or the result of an attack of rage which he couldn't control. The investigation did not uncover his latent psionic ability which remains unknown. If his release is negotiated, or he's freed by the Zhodani traders, and trained to control his anger and psionic ability, he could yet be employed profitably – although probably not in his hometown.

## Scene 2: Jumpspace

The _Zarvae'_ should have a good lot of passengers aboard for a week in Jumpspace to their next destination. This may include Stinford Glass and Zipramesk (Feffrim). Glass will be rather withdrawn and still getting over the shock of recent events, but will respond to either any attempts to treat him psionically or to get him involved in the start of learning shipboard skills. Feffrim, in her journalistic guise, will take an interest in the other passengers and will ask for a formal interview with one, or perhaps more, of the Zhodani. She'll try to persuade them that readers/listeners/viewers in the District would of course be interested in the 'ordinary' Zhodani and what life is like. That it makes a convenient cover to delve into their backgrounds is of course her real drive. If she interviews the survivor of the Shinchoddia massacre Feffrim will know about the event, but in her Zipramesk guise won't admit to that as it would be out of character to know about something not well-known outside of the Consulate.

Other passenger interactions can occur as desired to flesh out something of the week in Jumpspace and _Three Blind Mice_ offers some ideas about how this might be done. There may even be demand for Fifth Night celebrations (see Library Data) from those who know the Imperial traditions. Any older children or young adults amongst those travelling might be interested in seeing the mlok for example – particularly if they're told they're particularly vicious or deadly! On this occasion, however, any such role playing is not to disguise the presence of stowaways but so that the PCs have a chance to carry out their duties looking after the cargo of mlok. After a day or two in Jumpspace it will be apparent that the animals are becoming listless and losing their colour – although it won't be obvious why this is the case. After the week in Jump, roll 1d6-3 for the number of mlok that have seemingly lost the will to live and are found dead in their tank.

## Scene 3 : Noctocol Collapse

This scene is designed to take place at Noctocol (
E7A5747-8 Fl) and the Referee can wait until the players choose that as a destination, inserting any other side adventures or activities as desired, or the PCs can be encouraged to travel that way by, for example, favorable trade deals or a specific commission to ship cargo or a patron to the world. Alternatively, it could be set on another world with suitable conditions and population.

The PC or PCs tending to the mlok will notice that the creatures seem to have recovered and are once again thriving.

On arrival in system, or more likely given the tech level, when they arrive at the starport which is a pretty rough and ready affair on the surface near the main underground city of Darbon, the crew of the Zarvae' will be approached by the one full time, if you can call it that, starport representative on the world. Sheesta Armins is an old Imperial scout who has been employed by the Noctocolians to liaise with any travellers who want to stop at such an isolationist world. She doesn't see a lot of outsiders and although the crew are Zhodani it's almost a relief that they are anyone but inhabitants of Noctocol. She looks careworn and is exhibiting signs of stress. She'll greet the Zhodani and check that they speak Galanglic. She might enquire as to their purpose for visiting and how long they intend staying but she won't linger on niceties as she cuts straight to the point.

“There's been an accident and the Prime Minister was hoping you might be able to help. It's a great piece of luck you've come along – are we right in thinking you can detect lifeforms, at a distance?” It will be clear she doesn't know a great deal about Zhodani and presumes they all have similar and powerful abilities. “Basteen Neeceton,” who is the Prime Minister although the Scout won't be very coherent, “has declared a state of emergency. One of the underground rail lines has collapsed causing a further collapse in the residential area above. People are buried, emergency services and anyone really are trying to get to them, trying to pull them out but we're having problems finding people under the rubble. Can you help?”

If the PCs are willing to get involved various psionic skills can be brought to bear here; the most obvious being Life Detection. All six PCs have limited Telepathic skill and can attempt this. However other talents may be used. Clairvoyance, a particular skill of Stiekliepr, can be used to help visualize collapsed areas and direct emergency crews. Telekinesis, which Zoviepr as well as Zanzhzhiepr and Chenchapriepr have, might enable the movement of debris and objects to assist emergency services. Enhanced Awareness could help with co-ordination efforts, mapping work or managing comms while Psionically Enhanced Strength or Endurance has obvious applications and could be used by Brabrkliepr. The PCs may have other ideas which should be encouraged.

Armins won't lead on this, but if the PCs are mercenary enough to ask about payment she'll be a bit taken aback but add “the government has authorized me to say that we would, it goes without saying, waive port fees and refuelling charges were you able to help. We'll probably be able to get you a top broker for any cargo you might want to buy or sell and cover their fees as well.” Bear in mind, however, the relative poverty of the inhabitants regarding the purchase of any cargo the PCs might want to sell.

Assuming the PCs are willing to help, it will be a great way to present an extremely positive image of the Zhodani. The population of Noctocol are isolationist enough to be suspicious of anyone, psionic or not, but as soon as they see any of the crew actively assisting, they'll certainly be curious but also be favorably impressed. The crew may get questions as they work alongside any locals, but assuming they're competent and really do make a difference, will gain respect as well. If they were to voluntarily donate any of their cargo this would obviously raise their cachet even further.

At the scene, and Armins can join the PCs to act as translator with the local commander if necessary, there is a fair bit of chaos, but some hours have passed since the disaster and emergency services are on the scene and coordinating the rescue efforts. There are collapsed buildings on the surface that can be searched and although access is difficult, there is the old rail line tunnel to check as well. A train has been caught in the collapse and there could be passengers to locate and extricate.

Events may further be complicated by either additional tremors making precarious emergency excavations collapse further, or accumulated damage then affecting the atmospheric integrity of the main cave they're in risking ingress of the toxic atmosphere. Of course, both happening might further add to the pressure and expand the disaster relief necessary. Efforts will be further hampered by the broken or highly accented Galanglic many of the Noctocolians will speak. The PCs may be asked, or may volunteer, to visit the city at the other end of the rail line. This will be perfectly possible and will give them access to the tunnel from the other end. In such an event the Referee should play up the differences between the cities with yet more communications difficulties and a contrasting culture.

If the PCs refuse to help, Armins won't press them although she'll be obviously disappointed. The world has more pressing matters to get on with and the PCs will essentially be left to their own devices. However, they won't be able to buy or sell cargo – everyone is too preoccupied either with the rescue work itself or trying to ensure that everything, or more particularly everyone, is secure against any further damage. The PCs won't be able to refuel either and will be forced to refuel from one of the gas giants in the system. Should they return to the world, they won't be very favorably received.

If the PCs help out but are unsuccessful in making much of a difference, they'll be thanked for their efforts and receive the promised incentives.

If the PCs have been involved in the rescue of any inhabitants, whether using psionics or not, the Prime Minister will personally thank them, offer them the freedom of the city and invite them to a dinner which will be simple, but well prepared. If the PCs have been using psionics openly, they'll receive lots of interest about this and be asked to perform anything from parlour tricks to minor miracles. They can accede to such requests as they wish and as their capabilities allow. Should they return to the planet in months to come, they won't have been forgotten and should receive preferential treatment in the search for cargoes and bonuses on purchase or sale prices. Before departure there will be a touching farewell from the family of a little boy they've saved. The family have next to nothing, but have still collected up some savings to buy a large hamper of the very best hydroponic produce their city is renowned for although they will recognize it is of little value to the PCs.

The Zhodani Consulate will be very pleased to receive detailed reports on a world about which little is known. If the PCs have visited more than one city, this will be even more useful.

Once again after a day or two in Jumpspace the mlok will appear to become lethargic and uninterested in food or each other. After emerging from Jump they will recover once again except for 1d6-3 which will have died. The Referee should take care not to directly connect these events, however, and allow the players to draw their own conclusions. For each Jump they make en route to Dallia (or the eventual destination of the mlok) the same thing will happen making it increasingly obvious that the creatures are affected by being in Jump in some way.

## Scene 4 : Zhodani Out! (optional)

Of course, for all the positivity of the visit to Noctocol, it is extremely likely given general attitudes to psionics –
even outside the Imperium – that the crew of the _Zarvae'_ will be received with much less welcome on some worlds or in some cities. The Referee should pick a suitable world that the PCs are visiting, the more xenophobic the planet's population, the better. From their very first contact with any system control officers to their dealings with cargo handlers portside, people they meet will be either very reticent or openly fearful. They may even see some people who knew beforehand they would have to deal with the crew, wearing psionic shields. _Finding a broker sympathetic to Zhodani_ : Very Difficult (12+) Streetwise OR Broker, 1D days. For worlds with a population of >8 this task can be reduced to Difficult (10+) Streetwise OR Broker, 1 D x 10 hours. Without a broker who is willing to represent them, selling cargo will be very difficult as buyers won't even trust the goods they're purchasing never mind the Zhodani themselves, and buying cargo will be difficult.

The PCs will minimally be getting the cold shoulder, brush offs and unfavorable rates – even in stores with marked prices, but may also be on the receiving end of racist remarks and insults. This might be a good opportunity for the encounter with the crew of the Ganymede Express (see Act Three Scene 1 ).

It maybe that the crew of the Zarvae' want to actively look for opportunities to present the positives of psionics or the Zhodani Consulate specifically and there should be occasions when this is possible. However, it may not always have any beneficial effect and the Referee can make as little or as much of this as desired. The crew may also wish to deny, or at least downplay having any psionic powers at all in order to try and set the locals' minds at rest; perhaps literally.

## Scene 5: The Institute (optional)

This scene can run in parallel with the previous one or separately. As a complete change from typical (Imperial)
travellers seeking out a psionic institute, on any appropriately high population world that the _Zarvae'_ visits (Milagro for example), the crew might be sought out by a representative from the local Institute. He will be cagey at first and either meet them on neutral ground or come to the ship to suss them out. If this scene is run alongside the previous scene, Wilfren will be particularly paranoid until he's sure of the PCs.

**Bex Wilfren**
664777 - E, Age 54, 8 terms, Psions: Adept Rank 6: Master _Characteristics_ : STR6 (+0), DEX6 (+0), END4 (-1), INT7 (+0), EDU7 (+0), SOC7 (+0), PSI 14 (+2)

He's short (158cm, 5' 2”), quiet and self-effacing but has a confidence about him that commands respect. He's led the Psionic Institute known as The Workshop consisting of around twenty people, none of them anywhere near his talent but all deeply admiring him, for the last ten years.

[Referee's note: Unless the Referee wishes to have a complex backstory about a visit to the Imperium giving Wilfren membership of TAS, treat that award as an open pass to clubs and societies of his homeworld as something of a local guru not in psionics but as a life coach.]

**The Workshop**
This Psionic Institute is based in an old plasteel building known to locals as a former monastery and now occupied by a cult interested in life coaching. The psions will indeed teach anyone interested in various life skills, physical training, home and mental decluttering, and motivational speaking but this is a cover for their real activities which is to help each other develop their mental abilities and keep a watch out for any incomers who might become suitable trainees.

Wilfren's goal will be to get the Zhodani to come and speak to, encourage and assess his acolytes, and ideally give them some training. He might well start lightly however, by simply inviting them to visit. He's pretty clued up on Zhodani culture and the Consulate and will pander to their beliefs if it helps. He can speak a few words of Zdetl. Once there, and once he is showing the PCs the need of psions with limited skills and limited training opportunities, he'll step up the requests. If he can't persuade them to that, he'll settle for a visit, which they may be interested in doing anyway for the purposes of information gathering and at the very least saying a few words. However, should it come to actual demonstrations and the like, or any discussion of the extent of the PCs abilities, he will be first taken aback and then disappointed to discover that in fact he's far more skilled psionically than any of them as well as having more raw talent. He even has more understanding of the science of psionicology than any of the PCs. Eventually, however, he'll find this a great encouragement personally but it may lead him into an overweening pride in his own strength. “Even better than those Zhos, I am,” he will boast to his fellow Workshoppers – perhaps once the PCs have left.

This is of course a great opportunity for the PCs to meet with other psions, gain information on this kind of group for the Consulate, and to win the hearts and minds of a handful of non-Zhodani in the District. [Referee's Note:
Should the PCs wind up on Tarkine, they might be interested in tracking down the psionic institute described in 'A Troubled Mind' ( Freelance Traveller , no.58, October 2014) for something completely different, but that Institute will not seek them out.]

# Act Three

After a series of events which the PCs may spend more or less time dealing with, the crew of the _Zarvae'_ face a more serious threat as they're attacked by familiar faces.

## Scene 1: Attack

In any one of the previous scenes, or more specifically ports that the PCs have visited, there should be one encounter dockside with the crew of a ship in a nearby berth. The encounter won't amount to much more than some racist insults thrown at the Zhodani “you turban headed terrorists” (or did they say “tourists”?), and the crew of the _Zarvae'_ can respond in whatever they wish. They can ignore it, respond in kind, attempt to talk to the crew, attempt to calm them or control them using their abilities or, on worlds with a sufficiently high law level to make it worthwhile, report them (law level >9 for this to be any kind of infraction).

The incident will be sharp enough that any of the PCs might well recall the ship even a week or three later. The ship is the Ganymede Express and is a standard Far Trader ( Core Rulebook pages 1 66 - 167 ) equipped with two pulse lasers on the hardpoints. Its crew are fairly ordinary looking humans.

###### The Crew of the Ganymede Express Far Trader

The Ganymede Express is crewed by an unlucky bunch of ne'er-do-wells. Everything is against them they will repeatedly tell anyone within earshot – usually in the most down and out of starport bars. In fact, they're largely responsible for their own (mis)fortune as they make poor personal and business decisions, antagonize pretty much anyone with their behaviour and always see themselves as the victims.

Their ship is poorly maintained, something of a shambles inside and only manages to pick up the most desperate or impoverished of passengers, if they can find any at all.

In the usual way of bureaucracy he was then immediately drafted into the scouts but psychologically damaged in his first term and mustered out. For a couple more years he drifted but has suffered some unknown event that has left a gap in his memory. He has managed to get work as a pilot on the Ganymede Express where he is just able to hold down the job on fairly straightforward runs.

He was tested for psionic ability but was found to be of very limited skills and failed to take it further. Following this failure to graduate, Porl stepped into a shady life using his medical training for local crime gangs who didn't want questions asked. He was betrayed by a gang leader he was dating and much of the good work he had been doing amongst lowlifes, down and outs and the underclasses was sabotaged. Porl got work on a no questions asked Far Trader – the _Ganymede Express_.

**Lauren Elixabeth (Ellie) Broadchurch, Steward & Gunner**

Three terms as a citizen and one term as a free trader have given her abilities as a Steward and as a ship's gunner.

Sometime after this event, when the _Zarvae'_ is vulnerable, perhaps near a Jump point departure or approaching a small moon delivering a cargo, the _Ganymede Express_ will attack them. While they won't be able to converse with the crew, any attempt at communications will allow them to pick up the attacking ship's crew racially abusive language and clear threats of
“Get of out of our space you mind-sucking Zhos.” The language will be colourful but unimaginative. The _Express_ will open up with both pulse lasers and will inflict serious damage if they're able but will stop at outright destruction of the ship. If they can disable the Zarvae' they will not attempt to board it, but simply abandon them. If the PCs turn tail and run, either before retaliating or after taking damage, the humans will taunt them even more nastily. “And get out of the District and don't come back,” will be their final parting shot. If the PCs are able to inflict much beyond superficial damage the Ganymede Express won't linger but will Jump out with a few final well-chosen epithets. If the PCs attempt to negotiate, they'll simply be met with more abuse.

## Scene 2: Delivery of the mlok

Either on Dallia, or whatever world was agreed was the destination of the mlok, (see Act Two: Scene 1), the PCs will be able to deliver the mlok, or as many of the original shipment that have survived the journey (see Act Two: Scene 2 and Act Two: Scene 3). The Referee should keep track of how many haven't survived according to the number of intervening Jumps that have been made. However, if they've been more than six weeks in transit, they will have 1d6 young to perhaps make some recompense. What the PCs tell the university or institute where they deliver the creatures is entirely up to them.

If the PCs have made the connection regarding the effects of Jumpspace and pass this on, they will greatly interest the researchers. If they can provide some evidence, they will be rewarded with both an additional 10% on top of their original fee and the promise of being named, should they want to be, on any forthcoming paper on the subject. The researchers will be genuinely interested in this and excited about a potential new discovery, hitherto unknown. If the PCs have been conducting any kind of experiments to see if the mlok do catch their prey using psionics – the Referee should encourage creative use of their abilities in coming up with hypotheses to test – then the researchers will be even more thrilled. “Look, we can't pay you any more than we have, but we could probably get you visiting lectureships which come with a title and a small stipend. The duties wouldn't be arduous, recording some appropriate lectures and a couple of times a year a visit in person.”
Possibilities for the mlok method of attack might include Telepathy (assault), Clairvoyance (tactical awareness) to better predict where prey will be, or Telekinetic Punch. But players may come up with other theories such as a 'thrown' Awareness (suspended animation)
and this should be encouraged. There are research rules in Book 10: Cosmopolite which could be used here if there is player interest. Zanzhzhiepr, with her background in research, would be the most likely candidate to be interested in this, but the others may as well, particularly Kiazbratl with Investigate skill.

If the PCs opted not to carry the mlok as cargo, this scene could be replaced by any other cargo related side adventure the Referee wished to use. Alternatively, a side adventure involving the March Warden who happens to be on world – perhaps needing help with something she can't officially be seen to be doing. The Zhodani might not want to be involved in something that directly served the Imperium, but perhaps could be persuaded to a job that say, saved lives. Feffrim might be able to pull some strings behind the scenes, but could use a 'deniable asset' more locally. As ever, her cover as a journalist may come to the fore here. Whether she reveals her true identity will depend on the circumstances of the mission and how much the crew of the Zarvae' have gained her trust.

## Scene 3: What is the Zdetl for 'Karma'?

Finally, to bring this adventure to a climax, the PCs are faced with a dilemma. Whilst heading out to refuel at a gas giant, or perhaps just after arriving in system, they receive a Signal GK message. Alternatively, they are instructed by system control that they are the nearest ship or only ship in the vicinity which can respond. The signal is coming from a local gas giant often used in the system for wilderness refuelling. Such refuelling should be safe enough in general but accidents are often a sign of poorly trained crews or crews attempting to cut corners to save money – either in equipment or procedures.

Getting within sensor range, which is made Difficult rather than Average due to the interference from the gas giant's atmosphere, reveals the ship sending out the mayday to be a Far Trader. Getting within identification range or comms range it will become obvious that it's the Ganymede Express. It is genuinely in trouble –
although that may not be immediately apparent to the PCs – and the Pilot will report a drive coil failure such that it is unable to escape the gas giant's gravity well. He or she reports that the Engineer expects the hull to fail within 2d6 hours. Assume that there is also a Navigator and Medic/Steward making up the crew. The Referee will need to decide how many passengers (to a maximum of 12) in the upper deck staterooms are present and whether there are any low berth passengers (to a maximum of 6 – although the Referee might wish to decide where the sixth berth is located on the ship as it does not appear on the standard deck plans).

Does Tavrziansh, require that the PCs help these, well, Imperials might call them racist scum, but would Zhodani go so far? Does dutiful behaviour allow such dark thoughts or actions that might be considered revenge? Would anyone blame them if they failed to effect a rescue? Hopefully the players will be steeped enough in their characters' culture to have plenty of arguments on both sides.

Assuming the PCs do go to the assistance of the ship, perhaps extremely warily, use the following tasks consecutively:
_To plot a course taking into account the gas giant's gravity_ : Difficult (10+) Astrogation, EDU, 1D x 10 minutes. _To overrate the engines to provide power for a matching course in the gas giant atmosphere_ : Difficult (10+)
Engineer (power), EDU, 1D x 10 minutes. _To match course with the stricken ship in the gas giant atmosphere_ : Difficult (10+) Pilot, EDU, 1D hours.

The Referee should not immediately say how long this task will take but report the passing of time, perhaps with encouragement that the Pilot is “getting closer”, but allow the players to abort the rescue attempt. This can of course be fudged to maximise dramatic tension bearing in mind there are still some tasks to perform. The Referee may wish to consider whether any of the psionic abilities of the Zhodani can contribute to these tasks to either make them easier or take less time –
perhaps Telepathy or Clairvoyance to locate people to expedite movements for example, or Telekinesis to move an obstruction blocking access to, say, the Engineer. The following two tasks can be done simultaneously (by different people):
To effect a repair of the coil : Average (8+) Engineer (M-drive), EDU, 1D x 10 minutes. To effect a repair of the drive coil's computer system :
Average (8+) Electronics (computers), INT or EDU, 1D x 10 minutes.

Three of the crew of the Ganymede Express have all been knocked unconscious by a particularly nasty jolt to the ship dropping sharply in the turbulent atmosphere. The Engineer, however, is conscious but injured and bleeding. To staunch the wound(s) of the Ganymede Express '
engineer : Average (8+) Medic, EDU, 1D minutes + 5. A successful Empathic Healing task as well can reduce the time by 50%.

If the Ganymede Express can't be repaired, use the following task:
To evacuate the Ganymede Express' crew and passengers under the deteriorating conditions of the ship : Average (8+), DEX, 1D minutes x 5.

Any passengers should, theoretically, have been strapped down for refuelling procedures and should therefore be able to walk – albeit it with difficulty in the buffeting. Roll an Average (8+) Pilot task every two minutes through this process to avoid turbulence sufficiently bad to knock anyone walking to the deck and 1d6-4 damage. Additional injuries, however, could provide tasks for the less trained medics, Zoviepr for example. There will almost certainly be at least one passenger who is determined to bring some awkward, but extremely precious personal item with them or one demanding that some valuable jewels be retrieved from the ship's safe – located in the Ship's Locker behind the Bridge. 1d6 minutes to retrieve the lockcode from the Engineer and fetch the items.

The Referee should keep careful track of the time that is passing as both ships are under time pressure to either repair the ship or to evacuate onto the Zarvae' and get out of the vicinity before everyone is dragged down into the gravity well of the gas giant. Obviously, the Zhodani can bail out of the rescue at any point they wish. Any of the Engineers will have 1D minutes' notice of the imminent hull failure.

If they are able to get the crew and any passengers off the vessel, they can take them to the nearest world and feel they've done their 'duty' or could conceivably put them in low-berths perhaps and turn them over to the next Zhodani authorities or embassy they encounter. If they've chosen not to rescue the crew and then make planetfall in the same system they'll be quizzed very closely and suspiciously by the local authorities who will have also picked up the distress call. If they made an attempt to rescue the crew but failed, or only saved some, they'll also be questioned but should be able to demonstrate through logs or sensor evidence that they did, in fact, respond to the Signal GK.

If gas giant refuelling isn't typically conducted with passengers aboard in your Traveller universe, regard this as another cost cutting measure by the crew. This could then be the basis of charges brought against the crew of the _Ganymede Express_ although more likely bought by the passengers themselves than the PCs.

If they have rescued anyone, media reports will hail them as heroes on any world where anti-psionic feeling is not strong, and treat them with grudging respect if the Zhodani are not generally held in high regard. If the media are able to get hold of footage from either of the ships showing just how close things were and how tricky the whole situation was, this effect will be magnified. Give positive DMs to any subsequent trade deals.

It's also not impossible, if they have had personal contact with the crew of the Ganymede Express at any point during these events, that they may be able to help them psychologically. Either to offer healing – or at the very least an explanation – to Mars Yerick for his memory loss, or perhaps even to Pusa Abdernwick for her clumsiness if it's a neurological problem. Even Porl Gabchicos might stand to benefit from psionic training or discipline. It's possible that the meeting of the two crews could be a life changing encounter for the Express crew which puts them on an upward path of better habits and decisions.

There are other worlds to visit in District 268 and plenty of chances to report back to the Consulate on shipping movements, conditions and events in the region so there is plenty of opportunity for further adventure. And destiny may yet have an encounter with The Application of Credit waiting just around the corner. Indeed, perhaps the March Warden has a delicate mission that only both crews can undertake which would delay the start of, or reduce the impact of, the Fifth Frontier War.

# Library Data

**Dallia**
District 268 (Spinward Marches 1435) B885883- 9 Ga Ri Dallia is a garden world of some 600,000,000 inhabitants which is a client state of the Imperium and maintains a thriving colony on Tarkine (q.v.). It has a rather dense atmosphere which most travellers report taking 1d6 days to adjust to with endurance reduced by 2 and dexterity reduced by 1 during that period. The government is a civil service bureaucracy but there is a small noble remnant from days gone by and titles are awarded currently in recognition of services to the planet. All nobles are expected to serve a year in a blue-collar job on appointment or on reaching the age of 21.

**Dawnworld**
District 268 (Spinward Marches 1531) E885000-0 Ba Ga A garden world on the coreward edge of District 268, Dawnworld is uninhabited. Various attempts at settlement have been made by the Darrians, Sword Worlds, Imperium and Vargr. All these colonies have failed however due to some unknown, presumably environmental, factor causing sterility in all males born on the planet. The Imperium and the Sword Worlds both claim the planet.

**Elixabeth**
District 268 (Spinward Marches 1532) B426467-8 Ni Controlled from Dallia, Elixabeth is an unimportant world that's a client state of the Imperium and has an Imperial Naval Base established to ensure local political agreements are adhered to. With a chilly and thin, tainted atmosphere, the population of 2 0,000 lives mostly in the domed city of Jaffne (q.v). Culturally the inhabitants maintain a distinctiveness from the worlds around them to emphasise their independence. There is some resentment towards Imperial 'interference'
as it's seen.

Fifth Night An evening set aside on most ships in the Third Imperium, and beyond, whether large or small, for some form of entertainment. Most traditionally it is a 'jump-in' where motivated individuals or groups can demonstrate a talent and an MC or Master of Ceremonies will encourage participation, decide on a running order and introduce the acts. The Fifth Night tradition arose from it not being missed due to an early Jump exit but allowing some time for preparation. Sometimes, on passenger liners for example, it may be a more formal party or performance. Sometimes it is just an excuse for a ship with crew only to have a late night drinks or game session.

Forine District 268 (Spinward Marches 1533) D3129B8-A Hi Ic In Na A small and bitterly cold world which contains its population of six billion in tens of thousands of huge environmental domes. These dot the surface of the planet so evenly and so brightly that from space the nightside appears to be a single structure. Few travellers visiting the system miss a chance to observe this in all its beauty.

Jaffne A small domed city on Elixabeth (q.v.) which is known as a city of artisans. The distinctive culture of Elixabethans is represented in their exquisitely fine wood carving, lacemaking and miniatures. A tiny portrait of the Third Imperium's Emperor Strephon recently sold at auction for Cr218,000 and a dolls' house recreation of a ducal palace has toured as far as the Third Imperium. Visitors are encouraged not to miss the Camera Obscura – a tower that gives good views of the city and the cratered landscape beyond the dome.

Domed city of Jaffne (^)

**Mlok**
Sometimes known as the ridge-backed salamander, mlok are amphibious lizard-like creatures with blunt noses and smooth skins, save on their spines which have a ridge running from the top of their tail to two small protrusions, or horns, located behind their eyes. They have two forelegs and two hind legs with four toes apiece and tails which can be as long as their 20cm bodies. Unlike salamanders they do not regenerate lost limbs or tails but they do exhibit a wide variety of bright skin colouration to discourage guilesnakes and certain fish which are their predators. Although some are entirely aquatic, most inhabit water margins and eat arachnids, worms and the eggs of insects and molluscs. They can be introduced in areas in which the numbers of smaller invertebrates need to be reduced.

**Noctocol**
District 268 (Spinward Marches 1433) E7A5747-8 Fl A volcanic world with a poisonous atmosphere and prone to earthquakes. The population, known as Noctocolians and numbering around 60,000,000, live in large underground cities which have developed their own distinct cultures. Each city, and the world as a whole, has developed an isolationist culture and inhabitants are notably parochial in their outlook and self-sufficient in their technology – although standards of living are relatively low. Most starships passing through the system refuel at one of the two gas giants orbiting the companion star and move on.

**Shinchoddia Massacre**
In a largely naval conflict conducted by our brave Consulate crews, this was one of the largest losses of civilian life in the entire Fourth Frontier War, or False War. An extended of family of six adults and twelve children were attacked mercilessly by Imperial ground forces. All were killed save one of the children who was left for dead. It is typical of so-called Imperial Justice that no one has ever been held to account for this massacre.

Tarkine District 268 (Spinward Marches 1414) C566662-7 Ag Ni Ri Tarkine is a colony world run by Dallia (q.v.) with some 3,000,000 people now calling the world home in what has been a successful project that's drawing interest from other worlds looking to set up such settlements. Its shirt sleeve environment and rich agricultural potential suggest that it won't be long before the world has developed an industrial base that will allow it to be completely self-supporting.

At present Tarkine is designated an Amber Zone because of the abundance of dangerous wildlife – both flora and fauna – that easily injures and often kills unwary visitors. However, this has drawn the hardier types of hunter from all over the subsector and further afield as well. Cities and townships have generally been cleared of the most overt dangers but even here travellers are warned to read the local advisories and employ guides where appropriate.

Warden of the Marches The Imperium is vast and has lengthy borders stretching hundreds of parsecs. The Navy patrol this across many sectors but in some areas something more grass roots is required; boots on the ground as it were. Sector Dukes can appoint a March Warden to keep an eye on people, events and worlds reporting back as they see fit but acting occasionally if the situation demands. They are usually given the courtesy rank of Commander, have wide latitude for action, and can requisition local support – usually from naval assets – with the full authority of the Duke or Duchess. As they often travel incognito they can operate on both sides of a border, although outside the Imperium itself their authority is limited. Note that it is not only in the Spinward Marches they are called March Wardens, in this sense 'march'
simply means 'borderland'. The Spinward Marches has a long and complex border with many polities and is an unusual sector therefore may have more than one march warden in various places.

## Potential Passenger NPCs

The following characters can be used as potential passengers the _Zarvae'_ might have aboard on any of its Jumps, or they may be passengers aboard the _Ganymede Express_ that are rescued – or who are in the way during any repair attempts.

**Clir Tealing** , 798947, age 18, female, something of an amateur whizz with computers and rarely seen with her head outside of one; she will assume that anyone talking to her has ulterior motives and be quite suspicious; she is travelling to see an uncle.

Dunca Sai , 886643 , age 52, female, an actress on her way to star in a run of The Taming of the Shrevvel ; will hope she can persuade someone to feed her cues so she can practice her lines – “computers just don't feel the same” – and will have a fund of hilarious theatrical tales.

Jupni Gurntambalang , 756 B 27 , age 41, female, rather severe faced, Jupni is actually very friendly and has a way of getting people to open up to her; she doesn't so much offer advice but counsels them in a way that lifts the spirit and leaves anyone who talks to her feeling much improved.

Rhiis Ray , 533839 , age 95, male, retired businessman with no family. More income than outgoings and more used to cruise ships, so constantly wants to have a tour of the ship, or know where the entertainment is, or where the casino is – he keeps trying to pay for these things.

Nur Ujam , 6A75B9, age 56, female, retired soldier, wounded in some ground war and now constantly on the move “to put the past behind me”; often awoken at night with savage nightmares.

The Emperor's Thumb – rough and crowded Star & Sceptre – clean, old school, crowded The Duchess Delphine – old fashioned, run down, 1/3 full The Vargr's Head – small and very rough, ¾ full, half a dozen Vargr present the rest human Nova – pretentious, ½ full Brubek's – clean (although this one is more run down than usual), bland and 2/3 full

**nightclubs**
Black Diamond – really, the worst of the worst, filthy. In every sense oZone – trendy but full of student types Aslan Pride – no Aslan, just an older clientele.

## Additional Colour or Adventure seeds

**Events**
Customs check – severity dependent on law level. In orbit or in starport. 1D: 1-2 very lax, 3-4 routine, 5-6 very strict;
may be limited to cargo or extended to cargo manifests of recent Jumps; or may extend to minute stateroom examinations and/or passenger/crew records Zhodani Consulate embassy function, invitation, NPC (see above). Chance to meet nobles, traders, local government officials, socialites – deals may be made, the flag might be flown, or the PCs might be present when the Consulate is attacked or an asylum seeker is causing political difficulties Vargr NPC: Reg/Sabre, striking up a conversation (perhaps at embassy above), comments on being a long way from home and being an underclass; can offer views on local acceptance or otherwise Invitation to a dance (also Advert). Contacts: Zhodani or merchants or brokers, socialites Concert of a renowned singer (also Advert) – most likely merely good/average/poor entertainment but could be an opportunity for Zhodani to be recognized as such and insulted. Rubbish collectors' strike, trash everywhere, a nasty smell throughout city or starport or corridors of habitat; perhaps there is an old weapon barrel sticking out of garbage heap that is repairable with some work Some proles who have 'lost' their noble and need guidance Scuba trip – beautiful creatures (see _101 Lifeforms_ ), dangerous creatures Fraudulent psi training being offered by hucksters looking to make a quick Credit. This may not be immediately obvious, but PCs should be able to detect quite quickly Berthing very cheap but air/water costs in enclosed environment exorbitant Squad of (local) marines passing by – dependent on law level? Perhaps on world with low Acceptance to add to threat Psionically sick person brought in for help. If the medic performs well at the collapse, there may even be a queue of ordinary sick folk forming at the dock gate wanting aid Technology exhibition – Electronics – sensors (orbital, shop, office, home, handheld) (also Advert)
Down on her luck Imperial war veteran trying to get back to Imperium

**Locations (see also potential bars and nightclubs above)**
Credit Krissy's – loose network of small run-down accommodation conversions done on the cheap where the dregs of society can find poor quality entertainment on tiny stages; performers may well be available for more intimate entertainment following a show. Snort baiting – The <insert government leader title here> Arms, a run-down pub has a back room with a pit some 2m in diameter. Snorts are put in to fight each other; bets are taken. Snorts are 20cm rat type creatures with a snout, and teeth, like a crocodile. The smell of sweat, meat and blood is heavy – and to some, intoxicating. The Quantum – a gentlesophont's club where matters of the day – e.g. the possibility of a Fifth Frontier War are discussed. Good food, special membership for transient travellers? Or an introduction from some Zhodani noble on world?
Coffee shop of some kind – trade goods rumors; an idea of Acceptance levels. Animal sanctuary rescuing wildlife – entertainment but may also be educational (e.g. subtle difference between two similar creatures which could come in useful for a future cargo opportunity)
Greenhouses – flora and small fauna, renowned in sector for hydroponic excellence. Happen to see – or perhaps detect rather – some act of sabotage going on and curry favor with authorities

2 for 1 offer at local gym/pool/Anti-gravity hall (also Advert) – another chance to pick up rumors, meet people or perhaps have a pickup game of some sport or other & make contacts Kindergarten outing passing by (or the children in danger at the collapse site in Act II) – a teacher, teaching assistant and perhaps 15-20 children

**Adverts**
These may be encountered on entry into a system as part of standard broadcasting or when out and about on a planet's surface. This is not intended to be exhaustive but at each port the Referee might offer one or two that have caught the attention of the PCs for some reason.

Brokers of various kinds (see above for Potential Brokers) – they will be selling themselves on negotiating ability, contacts and perhaps even notable trades that made the press Local hostel/hotel facilities aimed at spacers wanting break from ship – they will be selling services and facilities from room quality to extras such as anti-grav or swimming pools to 'personal' services or nearby features Particular trade goods that want shifting (or are desirable) with “good rates” – these can of course be clutter and spam in incoming comms or lead to adventure opportunities by virtue of their nature or destination Starship suppliers touting for trade – chandleries will contain a vast mishmash of equipment from the very small to the very large - perhaps 'out back' or in yards some distance from the storefront; in extreme cases they may even have access to starship boneyards, on the ground or in orbit, at Trojan points, or off at asteroid belts Sophonts of dubious repute touting for trade – they may be selling something or offering services – legal or otherwise Individuals looking for jobs or working passage berths – closely aligned to the previous entry but usually within the local law levels TL8+ worlds – local social media being rude about off-worlders in general Concert of a renowned singer (also Event) – this could also be a job opportunity if the singer or their retinue is looking for transport or security or company even Invitation to dance (also Event – see above) – this Advert for (at last!) silent hand dryer, imports just arrived from TL12 world (taken till TL12 to make them silent)
2 for 1 offer at local gym/pool/AG hall (also Location)
Range of psionic helmets – comfort, detection, style Gourmets! Dragon steaks freshly imported from Nutema (Spinward Marches 3112). Limited stocks! – very, very expensive (but very high quality and tasty)
Fraudulent psi training – either intrigued PCs sign up for it out of interest or the adverts are blatantly advertising skills or abilities that they know can't possibly be real Technology exhibition – Electronics – sensors (orbital, shop, office, home, handheld) (also Event)
Tour of a ring system/moon, local 'dome facilities' for tourists (see Greenhouses above) – this could be simply a sightseeing opportunity or could be an opportunity for adventure if things go wrong – see _A Fall of Moondust_ by Arthur C. Clarke

A simple 2D dice roll could also be used with modifiers for distance from Imperium, size of population, neighboring world's attitude, etc. As ever, the needs of the adventure should be paramount. 1 is a low toleration of outsiders.

## Appendix 6: Roleplaying Zhodani

The **Driantia Zhdantia** [Zhodani Consulate] comprises over 6,500 star systems in 175 subsectors spinward of the Third Imperium.

The Consulate is remarkably stable, having retained a single form of government for the last 7,000 years. The Consulate is founded on two pillars: the acceptance of psionics and a belief in conforming for the good of society. This has resulted in a homogeneous culture across the Consulate, conforming to a norm first established on the homeworld Zhdant. Although the Consulate has fought five frontier wars with the Imperium over the last 600 years, it is not expansionist. Its borders have been stable for thousands of years, ever since the natural limits of communication were reached for the Zhodani style of government.

**Physiology**
The lower gravity of their homeworld Zhdant (0.85 Imperial
'standard' gravities) has led to the Zhodani being taller and more lithe than the Vilani and Solomani. Males average 2.1 meters (7 feet) in height and 90 kg (200 Ibs) in weight. They have 28 teeth, four less than Imperials. Though their homeworid's KO star is less bright than that of Sol, most Zhodani are quite dark-skinned or swarthy.

**Time**
The standard Zhodani zhdanstial [day; 27.02 Imperial hours] is divided into 20 zhdina ['hours']. The chten [year] is 244.44 zhdanstial [275.2 Imperial days]. Every three chten is one thequzdij [Olympiad; 2.25 Imperial years]. Zhodani year zero marks the first Psionic Games (-6731 Imperial).

**Government**
The Consulate is governed by a hierarchy of councils, from the Qlomdlabr [Supreme Council] down to local community councils representing around 50,000 people. Councils typically contain nobles elected by their fellows every Olympiad.

**Populace**
The Zhodani populace has a very strict social hierarchy with three classes.

**Proles** represent almost 80% of the population. Non-psionic and disenfranchised, they are the contented workers of the Consulate - the farmers, factory workers, scientists, technicians, supervisors, junior managers and enlisted members of the armed forces.

Intendants make up about 15% of the population and are the bureaucrats, professionals, military officers, teachers and medical specialists.

Admission to this class is through the demonstration of psionic aptitude in childhood tests, though some psionics develop latently, and are admitted later in life. Most Intendants aspire to nobility, which may be awarded to them through success in the Psionic Games, or (usually later in life) for exceptional deeds. Intendants try to excel at worthy activities while ensuring that their Noble receives the credit; through raising the Noble's status they raise their own by association.

Nobles represent about 5% of the Consulate population. They are the enfranchised voters who run the Councils governing the worlds of the Consulate. Each Noble has at least one Intendant as a personal aide; in return the Noble acts as their mentor and advisor. Nobles often have senior roles in the administration or in commercial ventures. Some serve on Councils but all are generally productive for the society -
something which they see as their duty. First-borns inherit the family estates and businesses while subsequent children may take up a career in politics, business or the military.

To outsiders, Nobles may appear aloof and superior, but in reality they are required to work hard to earn the respect of their subordinates.

Culture Duty is part of the underlying philosophy of Zhodani culture. The Consulate decries religion but the teaching of Tavrziansh
[Morality's Path] in all schools is endorsed as “proper thought. The fundamentals of this philosophy, encapsulated in the Fevranzhtavr [Book of Morality] are that life is a matter of duty, and that duty comes from living, i.e. duty is required of all creatures, however unintelligent. The social hierarchy embodies these principles as well as the overall duty to the Zhodani race. The biggest priority in any Zhodani's life is to keep their various duties from coming into conflict with each other, while harmonising their actions with the duties and responsibilities of others.

Honesty is a cornerstone of Zhodani society. When one's thoughts are open to being read by others, it becomes pointless lying, keeping secrets, or hiding one's true feelings. Trust is assumed, with doors commonly left unlocked (unless guarding against harm, e.g. to keep children away from dangerous machinery).

The Zhodani have effectively 'cured' greed and other such destructive urges so there is no need to steal. Citizens can be open and free with their opinions, while respecting and accepting those of others. The mere thought of lying or being lied to disgusts most Zhodani and is a major cause of their dislike of Imperial citizens.

Their inherent familiarity with mental processes gives them a comprehensive understanding, and acceptance, of emotions and how to deal with them: in stark contrast they see Imperials as bursting at the seams with guilt, secrets, hurts, fears and embarrassments.

**Privacy** is still important to the Zhodani in their private life:
not to conceal secrets or emotions, but rather to respect the dignity of acts performed for their own sake rather than for society at large.

**Respect** for ones' social superiors is ingrained into society, but true respect must still be earned, even by Intendants and Nobles.

**Violence** and conflict are frowned upon. However, the Zhodani are not pacifists: war and even genocide are acceptable to protect other life. From the Zhodani perspective, the Frontier Wars were undertaken to protect the peaceful inhabitants of the Consulate from the lying, untrustworthy and expansionist Imperials.

As a society, the Zhodani realise that they are all much the same, so they feel comfortable wherever they are in the Consulate.

**Conformity** is key to Zhodani society and is championed by the Tavrchedl' [Guardians of Our Morality] who seek out the troubled minds of the mentally disturbed or criminally inclined. The paranoid Imperials refer to them as the “Thought Police” but the Zhodani regard them as a combination of health visitor and law enforcer.

The Tavrchedl' do not constantly monitor the thoughts of the populace: privacy is an important right. However, at some point in their life most proles will be subjected to one of the random scans conducted by the Tavrchedl'. Scans of Intendants are rare and a Noble would only be scanned under extreme circumstances.

The judicial system considers the offender's mental health as important as the offence itself. Those who are mentally confused (e.g. by a major change in their circumstances or the loss of a loved one) are helped to adjust. Those who require punishment rarely suffer more than a fine, but repeated or severe offences may lead to enforced re-education.

Clothing is a visible manifestation of Zhodani conformity. All clothing styles are similar, with peculiarities for each caste:
Nobles will often wear a turban and cloak, with males favoring a stylish beard; Intendants wear headbands, which often distinguish them from the non-psionic proles. However, the Zhodani should not be stereotyped - they have the same natural variation in the patterns and length of facial hair as Imperials; not all male nobles sport beards; they have just as great a degree of creativity, divergence of opinion and freedom of expression as the Imperials, though the Zhodani focus these abilities for the common good, whereas the Imperials...

Competition is acceptable, both in teams and as individuals, though primarily in physical sports. The Psionic Games are strongly competitive as they provide a means for the most promising Intendants to achieve Noble status.

Humor is found in puns and linguistic tricks. Zhodani do not take amusement from the misfortune of others: to do so is against the principles of Tavrziansh. Slapstick humor and practical jokes involving humiliation are not appreciated. Outsiders sometimes characterise the Zhodani as humorless but in reality they are usually a joyful people, often laughing in delight or pleasant surprise and they appreciate mildly self-deprecating humor. Those who are too despondent to appreciate humor are usually suffering from a mental illness and will be identified and treated by the Tavrchedl'.

Racism might seem surprising given their philosophy, but the Zhodani are very uncomfortable beyond the borders of the Consulate, perceiving such places to be “where liars and thieves are allowed to wander loose, untreated for their conditions”. This discomfort is not merely disgust but also the realization that the innate honesty of the Zhodani leaves them open to deceit, cons and charlatans.

There is little racial diversity within the Consulate, so even mild physiological variety in other humans may appear strange to the Zhodani. Their diplomats and traders require special training to allow them to interact comfortably with non-Zhodani. Intendants and Nobles are better at handling contact with outsiders, but often still prefer the security of a psionic scan to ensure the honest intents of their visitor.
