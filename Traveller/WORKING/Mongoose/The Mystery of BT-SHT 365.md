# Introduction

Welcome to adventure and intrigue in the Trojan Reach! Mystery of BT-SHT 365 can be used as a companion adventure for a Pirates of Drinax campaign or as a mini-campaign in and of itself. Mystery of BT-SHT 365 is the first of three planned adventures in a series exploring the past of the Trojan Reach, the role of a rogue branch of the General Development Company, and showcasing the Traveller’s moral compass (or lack thereof).

The adventure is set into four acts. In Act One, the Travellers are contacted by a less than reputable broker and hired to do a bank heist on the planet Homestead. The job seems simple enough but becomes overly complicated when Oghman Raiders attack the town of Binyamin. The raiders make off with a number of townspeople and the sheriff offers to forgive the Travellers their trespass if they help get the townspeople back.

One of the people taken is his 14-year old daughter.

In Act Two, the Travellers conduct a dangerous rescue operation against the Oghman Raiders and learn of the tragedy that befell some of those that were kidnapped. One of those rescued is noblewoman from the Spinward Marches. Part of what was stolen from the bank included an ancient starmap and the noblewoman recognizes a system on the map. However, modern maps show no system present and it would lie in the Outrim Void. She offers to give the Travellers her Far Trader as payment if they take her to the mysterious planet. First, they’ll need to stop at the planet Thalassa to try to gain a bit more insight into scout records on the region.

Act Three involves the Travellers jumping to the location of the mystery planet and docking with a heavily damaged High Port in orbit. There, they meet a deranged android trying to conduct illegal research on a young cloned girl.

In Act Four, the Travellers go dirtside to the mystery planet and discover how far the Sindalian Empire would go to quell insurrection of any type. Hidden under the royal palace of the planet’s duke, General Development Company has setup a research lab and the Travellers find a long lost warship.

The appendix includes full stats for ships and NPCs created for this adventure.

# The Bank Heist

A broker working for Varuk Nirgal, on Theev, contacts the Travellers with a job proposition. The Travellers can be on any planet, though Theev, Marduk, Thalassa, Thebus, or Torpol are the most likely locations. The broker is named Anison James and will relate the following via holographic message:

“Greetings, my name is Anison James. I represent Varuk Nirgal, a broker of some renown, based out of Blacksand City on Theev. I am seeking a group of adventurous people to handle a job. Compensation will be far above the amount of work you will have to put in! If you are interested, please meet my pilot at docking bay 23-A. His ship will convey you to the planet Homestead, where we can meet at the GenEric! Bar & Steakhouse in the Starport. Good day to you.”

Should the Travellers take Anison up on his job offer, they will be on Homestead within the next eight to ten weeks. Of course, if the Travellers have their own ship, they are free to inform the captain that they’ll be traveling to Homestead under their own power. He’ll jump ahead of them and will convey this to Anison.

The Referee can use this mission as one of the test missions that Varuk Nirgal will require of the Travellers to gain him as a contact if you are running a Pirates of Drinax campaign

## Homestead D560250-

## Starport

The Starport on Homestead is Class-D and the startown barely qualifies as much more than a shanty town. Open-air ferrocrete pads serve as docking bays and the Starport seems to act more like an open air mall than an actual spaceport. The population of the Starport and Startown is only around 3,000 sophonts combined, with Humaniti representing over 98%. A few Aslan can be found roaming about and there is a rumor that a Vargr family lives in the Startown, but for the most part, the Travellers will see Humans going about their day to day lives.

The Starport offers only unrefined fuel and is very limited in any kind of repair facilities. The port mostly consists of a control tower, six ferrocrete landing pads, a GenEric! Bar & Steakhouse, Dalia’s Hotel, Meister’s General Goods, a maglev train station, and Horrson’s Spare Parts. Jim Horrson handles all the repairs and refueling for the Starport, which consists of spare parts from salvaged ships. Once or twice per month, Horrson sends his son, Danny, out to the system’s gas giant in their Pinnace to skim fuel for the port. Repairs are made from scavenged parts that Horrson has traded for or collected over the years. Nothing is new.

Dalia Cornicker owns Dalia’s Hotel, a two story wooden structure with swinging saloon doors for an entrance. Dalia charges Cr 60 per night for a room and includes a 25% off coupon for GenEric! Bar and Steakhouse. Other forms of entertainment are available, if the Travellers ask. Dalia will simply wink and nod, saying, “Oh, I know what yer lookin’ fer!”

William Meister owns the general goods store in the Starport. This is a small wooden building with general supplies available up to TL 8, but anything above TL 5 is 75% more than listed price. Meister receives a shipment of new stock about once every three months, and other than the foodstuffs, most of it seems used.

The GenEric! Bar & Steakhouse is considered to be a fancy restaurant in the Starport. As expected, it resembles every other GenEric! that the Travellers have ever encountered, down to the white painted concrete façade with black rimmed windows. The food consists of steaks, blooming onions, burgers, draught beers, and mixed drinks. The lighting is low, the booths are private, and there is a dance floor with a DJ for the weekends.

Anison James meets the Traverllers in the lounge of GenEric! and greets them with a smile and a handshake. After introductions are made, he orders a round of drinks and moves to a private booth.

Read or paraphrase the following:

“I’m very glad you have made the journey for this once in a lifetime opportunity! You seem like exactly the type of people that I am looking for.” Anison lowers is voice and leans in, “Not to put too fine a point on it, the job is for a bank heist.”

Leaning back in his seat, Anison holds up his hands, “I know, I know! I can see the apprehension on your faces. But hear me out! Do you know anything about the General Development Company? Well, GeDeCo is a pretty big corporation in the Trojan Reach. Too big, some might say. Things are hard in the Reach and GeDeCo has forced out plenty of the little guys. They took their jobs! This heist isn’t to rob the good people of this planet, it’s to rob GeDeCo of their hard stolen gains!”

While there are a few Travellers that will immediately jump right on this, most will have some questions. Anison will relate the following information.

- The job entails taking the maglev  train to the town of Binyamin.  GeDeco has a mining operation nearby that keeps its payroll in the town bank. Only the GeDeCo payroll crates are to be stolen.
- Payment for the job is 30% of the value of the payroll crates. Anison can be talked into 40% with an Average 8+ success of Persuade or Broker.
- If any of the townspeople are injured or killed in the process of the bank heist, the percentage drops by 10%.
- Drop-off of the GeDeCo payroll crates and payment will take place at a landing site 5km northeast of Binyamin. Anison will then have his ship either leave the planet or take the Travellers back to a landing site just outside the Starport.
- Anison will not say, nor does he know, the motive behind the bank heist. Only stating that GeDeCo is an evil overlord of a corporation. “This is your chance to stand up for the little guy!”
- The town of Binyamin is TL 3 on average, though some higher tech is available and is not foreign. The Law Level in Binyamin is 2.

Once the Travellers have had their questions answered, Anison offers a bonus of a Cr 1000 per Traveller stipend to equip themselves. He tells the Travellers he will meet them at appointed time and place to pick them up after the heist and then orders them all dinner.

### Binyamin

The small town of Binyamin is a frontier town on an arid plateau 1500km above sea level. Binyamin was originally settled by settlers from Thebus, trying to make a living through mining. Originally, the planet of Homestead was named Synre, during the height of the Sindalian Empire. Synre was a garden world but now, Homestead is an arid desert.

The people of Homestead worship a deity called Peror, which is an evolution of the word Emperor. At the northern edge of Binyamin is a single room church, with steeple and bell, dedicated to Peror. The people of Binyamin are simple, hardworking, and kind and will generally greet people with, “May Peror’s blessing be on ye!” Other evidence of the Sindalian Empire can be heard when a townsperson is surprised by someone. They may shout out, “State your business in the name of the Star Guard!” Even though the Sindalian Imperial Star Guard hasn’t flown a ship  or landed a Marine in over two centuries.

Homestead was not spared the despotic destruction and violence that marked the end of the Sindalian Empire. Fallout from orbital nuclear strikes on Homestead fell away long ago and the planet has recovered somewhat. However, biological attacks on the planet still rear their head in the form of plagues from time to time. The locals of Binyamin, in particular, talk of cases of
“the pox” and “wet lung.”

Pox is a virus that was mutated by the nuclear fallout. Thankfully, it never became airborne, but it is carried by small rodents, some insects, and cattle. Being bitten or ingesting meat from these animals can transfer the virus to humans. Initial symptoms begin with a fever, general weakness, and a cough. Within two to three days, large boil like lesions appear on the body. A case Pox is usually about 75% fatal in Binyamin, though it can be treated with modern (TL 7 or higher) antiviral drugs. Pox is relatively rare and there hasn’t been an outbreak in Binyamin in the last five years.

Wet Lung is a bacterial infection that mostly afflicts miners. The bacteria thrives underground and mining or pumping well water brings it to the surface. Wet Lung is characterized by a wracking cough, wheezing, and a shortness of breath. Local mint teas and mentholated rubs help with the condition but it is usually cured with the administration of TL 5 antibiotics. Wet

Lung is transferable from one patient to another via the cough or contact with mucous. Binyamin has a strict law against spitting because of this and all well water is filtered or boiled before use.

Binyamin is run by a provisional colonial council and has appointed Sheriff Dale Vantuck as its Mayor. Most of the day to day governing is handled by the council, but the Sheriff is required to act as Mayor for any business dealings or diplomatic engagements. The truth is that Binyamin has never had a “diplomatic engagement,” but Dale Vantuck does occasionally have to deal with the corporate miners from General Development Company or from Ganic Tammer’s mining outpost.

The town proper of Binyamin consists of the church, train station, bank, sheriff’s office, general store, Donaval’s Café and Eatery, saloon, and the blacksmith. The town doesn’t have a school, but Miss Micky O’Shae runs a classroom in the back of the General Store. Most of the town’s residents live within 500km, with numerous ranches and mining outposts out to a distance of 100km around the town.

The following entries are keyed to the map of Binyamin:

1. **Church of Peror**: The church is run by Pastor Mykhale Stonjinad. Pastor Stonjinad is a tall man with a dark complexion and came to town roughly ten years ago. He worked as a miner for a time but became the town Pastor after finally settling in. The townspeople have graciously accepted him, especially since the Pastor always seems to know them better than they know themselves! In reality, Stonjinad was part of a Zhodani scout ship that was exploring the Trojan Reach when it ran afoul of pirates. Critical errors were made and all but Stonjinad perished. The Pastor was able to limp the ship to Homestead and make a rough landing. Since then, Stonjinad has “gone local,” and prefers to keep his anonymity when dealing with offworlders.
2. **Train Station:** The train station is a simple wooden building with an automated vendor for tickets. There is a small seating area inside with Everfresh food vending machines. The maglev train travels east and west and will take about five hours to reach the Starport to the west or three hours to the east to reach the GeDeCo mining facility. There is a switch in the tracks about 1. hours east that leads to towns further south.
3. **Bank:** An elderly gentleman, by the name of Mr. Transom, runs the bank. The wooden structure consists of a lobby, three teller windows, the bank manager’s office with safety deposit boxes, and the main vault. The vault is locked with a combination mechanical and electronic keypad system. Both systems must be bypassed in order to gain entry. Of course, Mr. Transom knows both the combination and the six digit key.
4. **Sheriff’s Office**: This small wooden building sits next to the General Store and consists of three jail cells and an office for Sheriff Dale Vantuck and Deputy Shawn Borin. A gun rack on the wall the wall with two Rifles and a Shotgun serves as an armory.
5. **General Store**: A young woman named Micky O’Shae runs the town’s General Store. The store carries only the most basic of items (simple tools, canned foods, dried meats, first aid kits, etc). Weapons that the store may carry, in limited quantities, would be Category 1 and Category 2 civilian use weapons. Miss Micky O’Shae also runs a single room school house in the back room of the store.
6. **Donaval’s Café and Eatery**: This is a fine dining restaurant that uses Sindalian Empire porcelain dishes, emboridered cloth napkins, and silverware for every meal. The café is owned by an elderly couple, Mr. and Mrs. Donaval. The restaurant is generally run by the cook, Joel Hamocker, and the waitress, Daisy Sheul. Donaval’s is known for their Chicken and Dumplings and for their Corned Beef and cabbage. A meal and drinks will cost Cr 50, well worth the price for a fresh and home cooked meal. The café also serves as the meeting point for the town council.
7. **The Saloon**: The saloon is a joint venture run by Dathaniel Tamarin and Blackie Zin. Tamarin runs the bar and gambling tables while Zin is the madam of the brothel on the second floor.

   Tamarin has a still in the back for distilling his own whiskey, which packs quite the punch, and brews his own lager beer. The top floor has six rooms available and Zin keeps a stable of three women and two men for the brothel. About once per month, the saloon is extremely busy and rowdy, as miners come in from the GeDeCo mining town to blow off steam. Tamarin runs a number of gambling games during this time and has cards printed in the old Sindalian Imperial design for the occasion. It isn’t unusual for a few miners to end up in the sheriff’s jail cells for a night, but more than that isn’t something regular. Though, there have been a few gunfights in the past.

8. **Blacksmith**: Binyamin’s blacksmith, Jillian Laphatkis, is capable of just about any TL3 metallurgy. She’s very good at it, too. Tack for livestock, ranch fencing, and even wagon repair is available. Her son, Vin, works in the back of the shop and is an accomplished mechanic. With his mother’s help, Vin can fabricate parts for most grav vehicles at TL8. Vin has become a favorite with a lot of the ranchers in the area.

### The Arrival

It is assumed that the Travellers arrive in Binyamin via the maglev train and will start at the train station (Area 2). However, Travellers being what they are, it is entirely possible that they have other plans for their arrival and the Referee should account for this. How the Travellers wish to go about starting the bank heist is entirely up to them. Allowing them to case the town, feel out the local response, and simply enjoy themselves is perfectly fine. But if they are taking too long, it is alright to remind them that they are on the clock and have a meeting with Anison’s ship at a specific time that they agreed to.

Once the heist begins, it should be noted that old man Transom knows the combination and digital code for the vault. The combination is 83-48-14 and the security code for the keypad is 636*864. Without these codes, a Difficult (DM 10+) Electronics (Computers), EDU and Mechanic, INT check is required, along with a Mechanic’s Toolbox, to open the vault. Mr. Transom will not put up much of a fight and will part with the codes with a little effort. The safety deposit boxes in Mr. Transom’s office contain a variety of rather mundane items. Box 271, however, contains a pair of lead crystal goblets with gold inlay and etched with the Sindalian Empire coat of arms. These were family heirlooms belonging to Mrs. Donaval and are worth thousands of Cr to the right buyer.

**The Big Loot**: Once the vault has been breached, the Travellers will easily find the crate marked with the GeDeCo logo. The crate has a keypad lock on it that will require an Average (DM 8+) Electronics (Computer), EDU check to pick. Inside, the Travellers will find Cr 50,000 in hard currency. There are also two small, foam lined, cases that each contain a glossy black orb with rainbow fingerprints on each side and an ancient starmap printed on rolled up parchment.

The black orbs do not appear to do anything, unless someone has psionic potential. If a Traveller presses thumb and forefinger to the rainbow fingerprints on an orb and spends 3 PSI points, they receive a vision. The vision manifests as all light draining away around them and they are standing in a 3D virtual reality starmap of the Trojan Reach. The vision lasts about 30 seconds and will leave them with a bloody nose and a headache afterwards. Further attempts to use the orbs reveal cryptic visions of entire star systems exploding in a super nova and the death of millions of sophants. Though these visions are disturbing, they offer little insight.

The ancient star map shows a planet, labeled BT-SHT 365, where none should exist, in the Outrim Void. Any Traveller will know that this planet is impossibly placed with a Routine (DM 6+) Astrogation check.

### Unwelcome Visitors

As the Travellers are concluding the bank heist, they exit the bank to find a ship and some ground vehicles assaulting the town. Oghman Raiders have come to Binyamin and are attempting to snatch up townspeople. The Raiders are not being picky and they’re not being gentle about this. Generally, they are using harpoon guns (use Crossbow stats) with steel cables, stunners, Shotguns, Revolvers, Broadswords, Clubs, Maces, and the occasional Chaindrive Axe. The Raiders are using a 20-Ton Launch, Dune Buggy ( _Vehicle Handbook_ page 82), Gecko All Terrain Assault Vehicle ( _Vehicle Handbook_ page 83), and two Air/Rafts for their assault on the center of the town.

The townspeople of Binyamin are in real trouble and the Travellers have a difficult decision to make: Help fight the Oghman Raiders or make a fighting retreat out of town with the stolen goods. If they decide to fight, allow them to kill as many Raiders as they like but make it plain that this is likely a losing battle. Any Traveller that is rendered unconscious will be snatched up by the Raiders. At the end of the day, ten women and four men from the town are kidnapped. One of these women is Sheriff Dale Vantuck’s 14 year old daughter.

As the Travellers make their way out of town, but before they reach Anison’s ship, their mobile comms light up with a message from Sheriff Vantuck. Read or paraphrase the following:

“I’m not sure who you are, or who you are working for, but I’m in desperate need of your help. You can keep what you stole...” The sheriff’s voice breaks up, as he tries to control his sobbing,
“...Just please help us. A number of people have been taken by the Oghman Raiders. One of them was my 14 year old daughter, Amelia. All will be forgiven and you can keep what you stole, just please help me. I have to get my little girl back...” He continues to cry until the comm goes dead.

Will the Travellers help a father in need or will they deliver the stolen crate to simply get paid for the job. Evidently, they have a moral quandary on their hands.

# The Rescue

## The Oghman Raider Camp

Assuming that the Travellers don’t just cut and run after the assault on Binyamin, the Raider’s camp is set about 4km north of town. In a small valley, between two hills, the Raiders have landed a Type-R and a Safari Ship that they have cobbled together with spare parts. The Type-R is heavily modified and has Jump-2 capability at the cost of some of its cargo space. The Type-R is missing its Launch, either destroyed or out raiding other towns, depending on the Traveller’s actions in Act 1.

In addition to the ground vehicles sent out in Act 1, the Raiders have sent four raiders out on G-Bikes, two per bike. These raiders have killed the families of three different ranches and stolen their cattle. They are herding the cattle to a make-shift pen at the Raider’s camp. Slaves captured from Binyamin have been loaded into the Safari Ship and it will be determined later if they can read or not. However, not all of the slaves have simply been locked up. Three of the women, including Amelia, have been abused. One of the men attempted to protect them and was shot in the head. His corpse is now being spit roasted, along with a side of beef, over an open fire in the Raider’s camp.

Meat has already been carved off and you should make this revelation as shocking as it sounds.

Any supplies that have been stolen from farmsteads or towns have either been loaded into the Type-R or are stacked in front for loading later. In total, there are 15 Oghman Raiders in the camp, though only five of them are on guard around the camp at a time. The rest are getting drunk on stolen liquor, eating (shudder...), and carousing about how well their raid went. The overall attitude of the camp is jovial after such a successful raid.

## How to Go about things

The Travellers have two options here: They can try to negotiate for the release of the townspeople or they can literally kill every Raider they find. If they try to negotiate, the leader of the Raiders, Hegkar the Vengeful, will agree to release the slaves for MCr 1.5 worth of technology. This is only for the slaves, Hegkar plans to keep all of the stolen loot and cattle. He also plans to keep Amelia as his wife, proclaiming that she is the mother of his future heir. Hegkar the Vengeful can be negotiated down with a Very Difficult (DM 12+) Persuade, SOC or possibly even a Carouse, SOC check. If a Carouse check is used, the Travellers will need to pick a member to enter into a one on one knife fight with a Raider. Success will lower the Persuade, SOC check to a Difficult (10+). Success on this check will cause Hegkar to reconsider and agree to release the slaves for Cr 800,000 worth of technology and any repairs that may need to be made to the Raider’s grav vehicles. This is still an amount that is too high for Binyamin to pay and few in the town would be willing, anyway. Binyamin wants blood at this point. A Difficult (10+) Persuade, SOC check will be required to get the town’s Provisional Colonial Council to agree to such a measure. And, once learning of what happened to Amelia, Sheriff Vantuck will go out and attempt to kill some Raiders on his own. He will end up being killed in this endeavor, but Amelia and the other slaves will be returned to the town.

If the Travellers agree to go about a bit of the ultraviolence, it should be noted that a lot of things can happen out in the desert at night. Accidents are a terrible thing in the dark. Raiders could “accidently” hurt themselves. A determined group of Travellers could wipe out at least half of these Raiders if they took their time. Let the Travellers come up with a tactical plan and figurines combined with a vinyl drop mat, and some dry erase markers, may help them greatly. Referees are encouraged to let them be inventive. Literally allow for thrilling heroics! Give out Boon and Bane dice freely for good ideas. They might have started as the bad guys but they’re doing the right thing here, so be generous and let the bloodbath begin.

Once the Oghman Raider’s have been dropped to five, they’ll start to retreat to their ships and try to negotiate. Considering what they have done, the Travellers should consider their pleas lightly.

### The Raiders are Raided

Once the Oghman Raiders have been dealt with, the Travellers will need to deal with the slaves. Most will be on shaky ground from a psychological standpoint, either from physical and sexual abuse, or mental abuse simply from watching one of their own be butchered for food. One of the slaves will reveal herself to be something more than just a local.

Dame Coreline Petrovsky, a noble from the Spinward Marches, came to the Trojan Reach researching her family history. Petrovsky was in the town of Binyamin when it was hit by the Oghman Raiders and was caught up with the other slaves. Being a bit tougher than the rest of the townspeople, Coreline will keep an ear open and try to evesdrop on her rescuers. Either through listening or telling the Travellers, it will soon become apparent that Coreline Petrovsky was in the Trojan Reach searching for a now lost planet. A planet that was ruled by her ancestor, Duke Leopold Petrovsky that existed in the Outrim Void.

Upon this revelation from Dame Petrovsky, the Travellers may put two and two together from the ancient starmap that they procured from the bank heist. Coreline is desperate to find and explore BT-SHT 365. She offers to higher the Travellers to take her there and will pay them with her ship: An Emperess-Marava Class Far Trader that she purchased on Squalia/District 268 from a salvage yard named, “Shenanigans.” The Far Trader is currently docked at the Homestead Starport and is theirs if they take her to the planet. Considering the distance, she insists on stopping at the planet Thalassa first. She hopes that there will be some information on BT-SHT 365 on Thalassa and the Travellers will need to refuel, anyway.

### The Petrovsky’s

Either the Travellers have facilitated a happy or depressing, and even somber, reunion of the townspeople to Binyamin. During the five hour maglev train ride back to the Starport, the five hours out to 100 diameter safe jump distance, and the one week jump time to Thalassa, Coreline Petrovsky will relate what she knows of her family history in the Trojan Reach.

Leopold Petrovsky was granted a planetary land right by the Star Dragon Empire of Sindal. Leopold was an admiral in the Star Guard and had proven himself on numerous fronts. His wife, five daughters, and three sons relocated to the Petrovsky ancestral home to build their palace. However, Leopold grew to be a just man and was frequently a thorn in the Emperors side. He opposed the Emperors heavy handed rule and constant raiding on outlying systems. It wasn’t long before the Emperor made an example of Duke Leopold.

The Emperor accused Leopold of sedition and made a decree stripping him of all titles and lands. In preparation, Leopold sent his daughters out on a Yulang III Class Destroyer, but he and his wife remained behind in the Palace. The Emperor of Sindal laid waste to the palace, shortly after. Thus began the fall of the Empire of Sindal.

Throughout the centuries, the line of those five daughters intermixed with the royal lines of the Third Imperium. Four of those lines became dead ends; casualties of the frontier wars and internal strife in the core worlds. Coreline’s own great-great-grandmother was assassinated on Capital and many think it was because of her lineage.

Coreline Petrovsky is reputed to be, though she claims it as a fact, a cousin tenth removed from Duke Norris of Regina of Deneb. Coreline, now in her late 60s, spent some time in Regina’s Intelligence Bureau. Though, this will only come out with a Difficult (DM 10+) Carouse, END check, Boon dice if alcohol is involved. She likes dirty martinis.

### Thalassa B88A889-

Thalassa is a water world, with oceans covering the entire surface, located in the Dpres subsector of the Trojan Reach. The only dry land that is available is Thalassa’s Starport, and accompanying Startown, which acts as the capital of the plant. The entire Starport and Startown are built on an artificial island. Other Thalassan cities are built on floating platforms that are woven from natural reeds. Some of these floating islands can reach more than 20km across and support thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of people.

Nearly everything on Thalassa is locally produced and almost all technology used is organic. One of the chief industries on Thalassa is snail farming. The sea snails can grow up to 6m in length and are used much as beef or chicken is used on Earth. The shells of the snails are as strong as steel and have been developed into organic compounds that allow the Thalassans to cut and weld the material as other cultures do with concrete and metal. Likewise, seaweed is cultivated for everything from plastics and clothing, to food and medicine. While there are few resources that cannot be obtained on the planet itself, Thalassa has a rich mining industry on the moons and asteroids of the system. Other items are traded for with offworlders.

Thalassa is ruled by a group of councils, each one taking responsibility for a particular part of Thalassan society. Of these councils, the most important is the Council of Cycles. Because the Thalassan cities float on the ocean currents at differing speeds, it is important to know where each city will be and how it will interact with its neighbors. A city may be in an area where it could run low on food, so the Council of Cycles would arrange for a transfer of food from a more prosperous city drifting into the area. The Council of Cycles uses weather and the oceans currents to effectively run Thalassa’s economy. This experience with anticipating and coordinating events has led to a talent for shrewd diplomatic maneuvering, as well. Thalassan trade envoys are known to have their ear to the ground on every ruler in the subsector.

One important technology that the Thalassans obtained from offworld was a form of genengineering. Thalassa gained a genetic modification from the planet of Neumann that allows some humans to breathe underwater. These genetically modified humans belong to a special caste on Thalassa that many respect, but many more also fear them.

### Thalassa Downport

Once the Travellers have emerged from Jumpspace and begin the roughly six hour journey to Thalassa, they’ll receive a message from the Thalassa Starport confirming that they are on the ports scopes.

Read or paraphrase the following:

The blue world of Thalassa gleams like a gem in the darkness of space. Even at this distance, you can tell that the entire planet is a large ball of water. Some minor traffic in the area heads towards or away from the planet. The bulk of the ships are Seeker Type-J class mining ships, heading for the asteroid belts or the moons, while other ships are small Type-A class Free Traders or a lumbering Type-R class Subsidized Merchants. About half way to Thalassa, the comms come alive with the familiar whine and static of a port authority.

“Attention SPX-442, Thalassa Spaceport has you on our scopes. Approach on vector five-two. You are clear to dock in bay 25-B. Be advised that we are experiencing a bit of local weather. Welcome to Thalassa. Port authority out.”

Local weather on Thalassa apparently means a small hurricane and a normal docking procedure suddenly becomes a harrowing experience. The dense atmosphere of Thalassa causes the occasional heavy storm and the rain is coming down in sheets. Lightning strikes on the Starport and ocean are happening all around, while 240km/hour winds buffet the ship. The pilot should make three Difficult (10+) Pilot (Spacecraft), DEX checks. A success on a check should give them a Boon dice to the next roll. Failure on two of the three rolls means that the pilot has skipped the ship off the surface of the ocean causing 1D in hull damage. This can be repaired at the Thalassa Spaceport for around Cr 1000. Meanwhile, any of the other Travellers that are not strapped in should be making Difficult (10+) DEX or Athletics (DEX) checks. Failure means that they take 1D damage from being bounced around the inside of the ship.

The storm should be harrowing, even to the point of some of the Travellers needing to change their underwear, but it should not lead to the destruction of the ship or any major injuries. If the ship skips off the ocean surface, Thalassa Spaceport will radio the Travellers again:

“Whoa...uh...[static]...we thought we lost you SPX-442. Storms on Thalassa can be a bit of a jolt if this is your first time dirtside. We’re hoping everyone is ok, do you need medical assistance at the docking bay?”

Beyond weathering the storm, docking at bay 25-B is fairly standard. Thalassa sports a Class-B Spaceport and is kept in fairly good condition. The docking bays are large, two-story circular buildings. B designates that the docking bay is on the second level, while docking elevators transport some craft to the first level of A. The center of the circular docking ring is a tower for the port authority, with the typical commercial shops on the lower level. Outside of the Spaceport, the startown sprawls out in a neon lit bustle. Though, many of the businesses in the city are currently locked down due to the storm.

Even in the Spaceport, the rain can be heard beating down on the building and the wind can be heard howling outside. The Law Level of Thalassa is fairly strict. In the Spaceport, it is acceptable to carry holstered sidearms and blades, while wearing up to Mesh armor. However, leaving the port into the surrounding Startown is another matter. All weapons and armor are restricted outside of the Spaceport. For the Traveller’s purposes, there should be little reason to leave the Spaceport, though.

The concourse of the Thalassa Spaceport has numerous shops, local eateries, and the usual number of chain businesses. The two largest of these chains is a Brewhouse Tavern and an Advantage Hotel. The familiar holographic logo of a green diamond with a canted white A is prominently displayed in front of a five-story building denoting it as part of the Advantage Hotels chain. Across the concourse from the hotel is the Brewhouse Tavern. At the corner of the concourse, as you exit the docking bays and the Port Authority, the comforting TAS hologram shows a Traveller’s Aid Society.

### The Traveller’s Aid Society

A comfortable Class-B Starport is an absolute rarity in the Trojan Reach, but a TAS is an oddity that is rare beyond that. The Traveller’s Aid Society is usually only found in Imperium space or in the Spinward Marches, yet Thalassa sports one here. Coreline Petrovsky insists on entering the TAS in the hopes of researching her ancestral planet, or at least to gain some rumors on it.

If the Travellers do not have membership with the Travellers Aid Society, Coreline waves this off. She produces a membership on her mobile comm and insists that the others join her as her guests.

“We simply MUST go into the TAS. The Society may have information on this planet! And it simply isn’t appropriate to not pay a visit. You don’t have a membership? Rubbish! You can be my guests!”

The TAS hall is populated with a few spacers. Some seeking work, some having a quiet drink, others searching the TAS library computers. The main hall has a large kiosk with multi-screen monitors displaying trade, mining, and other jobs to Travellers. A side room to the left of the hall contains a small bar and smoking room, dominated by a large holographic fireplace. A second side room to the right of the main hall contains the TAS library, consisting of computers and some shelves with actual books and scrolls in paper or flimsy form. Elevators at the back of the hall lead up to the TAS hostel, available to members and their guests, that cannot afford a more elaborate hotel or for those that prefer the company of other Travellers.

A simple search of the TAS library computers shows no information on a planet named BT-SHT 365 and the library computers insist that no planet exists at those spacial coordinates. However, an Average (DM 8+)
Electronics (Computers), EDU check will show that a Serpent class Scout ship named the _Themasus_ scouted those spacial coordinates 15 weeks ago. A second Electronics (Computers), EDU check shows that this scouting mission was financed by the General Development Company.

Any Traveller that can succeed on an Easy (DM 4+) Engineer (J-Drive), Astrogation, or Pilot (Spacecraft), INT check will know that a Serpent class Scout would not have been able to make that trip. Unless there was a star system or base to refuel from, that is. A third Electronics (Computers), EDU check will show that the _Themasus_ is currently docked at the Thalassa Spaceport in bay 37-A and registered to a Captain Charles Carbatkin. However, Captain Carbatkin is not registered as being checked in at the TAS Hostel.

The obvious two places that Cabatkin could be staying would be the Advantage Hotel or simply aboard the _Themasus_. The Travellers would need to perform a bit of breaking and entering to get into the Themasus without Carbatkin’s security code and they would be doing it under the noses of the Port Authority. That’s likely to land them in a detention cell for quite some time, not to mention having to answer questions that may make them sound a bit looney. “No, really! We swear there is a planet out there!” The safer of the two options is to simply check at the Advantage Hotel and Coreline is happy to suggest exactly that, if your Travellers are not exactly quick on the up-thrust.

Dame Petrovsky considers the information for a moment. “If the good Captain isn’t staying here, then he must be staying at the Advantage Hotel. With the Brewhouse Tavern directly across the concourse, he would likely visit there for food and copious amounts of drink. I suggest we go have a meal ourselves and ask around.”

The Travellers can, of course skip the Brewhouse Tavern entirely and go directly to the Advantage Hotel. But a good meal that doesn’t consist of a tofu-like protein paste with a flavoring additive mixed in and a cold beer might be something that a group that has just spent a week in space might prefer.

### The Brewhouse Tavern

The Brewhouse Tavern is a typical example of the chain of restaurants from across charted space: A showcase of locally grown, farmed, distilled, or fermented foods from within a hundred meters of the bar itself. The seating and tables are even constructed from composite snail shell and snail leather with a heavy sea weed thread

It’s a slow afternoon at the Brewhouse when the Travellers enter. The bartender seems to be working two jobs at once and greets them cheerily, seating them in the lounge. Her name is Cas Alandria and she’s happy to make small talk with the Travellers as she serves their drinks and they wait for their food orders. A Routine (DM 6+)
Carouse, SOC check will confirm that Cas indeed knows Carbatkin well and that the Captain has been a regular customer at the Brewhouse for the past several weeks. It seems like he eats here multiple times per day and has been enjoying himself living large on some huge payout he recently received. Oddly, Cas hasn’t seen Carbatkin for a few days, though.

An Average (DM 8+) Carouse, SOC check will reveal that Cas has been working a double shift for the past few days because her waiter, Kirt Benacio, hasn’t shown up for work. She attributes this to a minor illness that has been going around lately and expects that he’ll be back to work soon. She mentions that Kirt and the Captain had been dating and suggests that maybe the two of them went on a romantic cruise together. Cas knows that Kirt would sometimes purchase a bottle of Thalassan Distilleries Sea Weed Vodka from the bar and take it to Carbatkin’s room across the concourse at the Advantage Hotel when he got off work.

The Referee should feel free to grant Bane or Boon dice for these Carouse rolls based on how the Travellers conduct themselves, or even based on how freely they spend their credits.

### The Advantage Hotel

The lobby to the Advantage Hotel consists of a small concierge desk with a very bored clerk, a small sitting area to the left of the entrance, four holographic slot machines to the right of the entrance, and a small stairwell that leads up to the room levels directly behind and to the right of the concierge desk.

When the Travellers enter the lobby, there is a young couple playing the holographic slot machines and a woman reading her mobile comm in the sitting area. An Average (DM 8+)
Persuade, SOC check will be required to convince the concierge to give out Carbatkin’s room number. Again, give out Boon or Bane dice fitting to how the Travellers role-play this. Good ideas, or lies, should be rewarded.

Upon a success, read or paraphrase the following:

“Alright, I see that Captain Carbatkin is staying in room 318B. That will be on the third floor, east side of the building. Would you like me to call up and let him know you are arriving?”

As the Travellers are talking with the concierge, two men in black Mesh leather overcoats come down the stairs. Allow the Travellers to make a Routine (DM 6+) Investigate or Recon, INT check to notice that these two individuals are up to no good. A success means everyone rolls for Initiative. A failure means that these two men get to open fire in a surprise round.

The two men are agents of Silvaria Marios, an operative working for the General Development Company. Marios has been tracking Dame Coreline Petrovsky since she started poking around for information on her ancestral planet on Salif. Since then, further events have unfolded and Silvaria has been tasked with putting a lid on a rapidly expanding pressure cooker. One of the agents pulls out two Assault Pistols ( Central Supply Catalog page 108), while the other is armed with a Laser Carbine, has a holstered Heavy Revolver ( Central Supply Catalog page 110), and two Stun Grenades. Both are equipped with Mesh leather overcoats that somewhat conceal their weapons. The pair have no issues with killing everyone in the lobby and plan to do exactly that. The Referee should feel free to have any missed shots hit the concierge, the woman reading her mobile comm, or the young couple at the slot machines.

Once the gunplay begins, the Travellers will only have minutes before Spaceport security arrives on the scene. Should the authorities arrive, the Travellers will be detained. Not only for questions involving the gunfight, but because of the crime scene found in room 318B.

### Room 318B

The door to room 318B is unlocked and slightly ajar. Upon entering the room, the Travellers will first see a naked young man lying face down on the bed. The young man is clearly dead, as there is an obvious laser burn through the back of his head. In the bathroom, they find Captain Charles Carbatkin on the floor with a towel wrapped around his waist. It is obvious that he too is also dead, as there are laser burns in his chest, neck, and forehead. A Routine (DM 6+) Medic check will reveal that both have been dead for about two hours.

A Routine (DM 6+) Investigate, INT roll will allow the Travellers to find Carbatkin’s Mobile Comm, though it is fingerprint locked. Once unlocked, the Mobile Comm will show that Carbatkin’s present Credit balance is Cr 80,000 and can be transferred via a retinal scan of one Charles Carbatkin. The Mobile Comm also has access to the security codes for the _Themasus_ , which is presently docked in bay 37A.

An Average (DM 6+) Investigate, INT check reveals that in the closet, Carbatkin has some clothing and his gunbelt: A holstered Magrail Pistol ( Central Supply Catalogue page 110) and a sheathed Psi Blade ( Central Supply Catalogue page 103). On the floor, between the bed and the closet, an open black case with a foam lining can be found. This case matches the cases the Travellers found on Homestead containing the black orbs. However, this case is empty.

### Docking Bay 37A

As expected, the Thamasus sits in bay 37 on the lower deck of the Thalassa Spaceport. The Themasus is a Serpent class scout ship ( Highguard page 114) and appears to be kept in fairly good condition. Using the Captain’s Mobile Comm will allow access to the ship without having to bypass any of the security routines.

The Themasus’ cargo hold is empty, but it’s logs are not. A Routine (DM 6+) Electronics (Computers), EDU check will reveal two things. The first is that the Themasus did, indeed, land on BT-SHT 365 approximately 15 weeks ago. The log shows that the ship was refueled on the planet’s surface. The second piece of information is a detailed surface scan of the planet. This scan shows that BT-SHT 365 is a barren desert world with a few oases. There are some small bodies of water, but none are larger than a lake. This information is the complete opposite of what is detailed on the old starmap that the Travellers obtained on Homestead. The starmap lists BT-SHT 365 as a garden world with two large oceans.

An Average (DM 8+) Electronics (Sensors), EDU check will reveal a bit more information. It seems that there is lingering radiation from apparent nuclear strikes in thousands of locations along the planet’s fault lines. There is also the presence of viral and bacterial contagion in the atmosphere. In a decaying orbit over BT-SHT 365, there is evidence of a heavily damaged high port. The decaying orbit will bring the high port into the planet’s atmosphere within the next 20 years. The _Themasus_ evidently scanned, and landed in, a city on the planet. This city appears to be a TL 12 civilization but presently shows a population of zero.

Carbatkin’s log is kept in the Themasus’ library computer and can be accessed via an Easy (DM 4+)
Electronics (Computers), EDU roll. The logs show that the Themasus took three black orbs on board. Carbatkin was to deliver the three orbs to a GeDeCo representative on Homestead. However, the logs seem to indicate that Carbatkin altered the original manifest to show that only two orbs were taken. It seems that the Captain wanted to keep one for himself.

# BT-SHT 365 High Port

## An Orbit Too Long

It takes a week to make the Jump-2 from Thalassa to BT-SHT 365. After the evidence that has been found, the Travellers should feel fairly confident that they are not taking a journey to their own graveyard out in the cold vastness of the Outrim Void. Once the Travellers exit jumpspace, it will take about five hours to travel to the planet, though it is only two hours to reach the high port.

The high port has clearly seen better days. A trail of debris follows the station’s orbit around BT-SHT 365 and an Average (DM 8+) Electronics (Sensors), INT check reveals numerous railgun and particle beam impact marks on the station. The sensors also reveal that the station itself is very old, with a multitude of micro meteor impacts across its entire hull. A Difficult (10+)
Electronics (Sensors), INT will also reveal that the high port is not completely inert. A power signature is active and parts of the station are registering electro-magnetic emissions.

When the Travellers are about 15,000 km from the high port, an automated message comes over the comms:

“Attention SPX-442: Landing on Vama...[static]...prohibited. You are directed to dock with the Baron Von

Braun High Port. Please maneuver...[static]...4. Deviation from docking maneuvers to the planet will result in your ship being fired upon. Welcome to...[static]...out.”

If the Travellers are using Shenanigans as their ship, the hidden A.I. in the computer core becomes active. It informs the Travellers that a number of high yield torpedoes from the high port have locked onto their ship. If the Travellers are using another ship, or if they wish to confirm this information, a Routine (DM 6+) Electronics (Sensors), INT roll will do the trick. The torpedoes seem to be nuclear armed, leaking radiation, and more than sufficient to turn the Travellers and their ship into a radioactive gas cloud.

Role-Playing SPX-442 Shenanigans A.I.

The A.I. hidden aboard the computer core of the Empress-Marava class Far Trader is there to be a Referee played character. The A.I. was coded long, long, ago in a partially translated programming language found at an Ancients archeological site. As to what the A.I.’s original purpose was or who actually programmed it, is anyone’s guess and may be a topic for another adventure.

The A.I. has seen several crews of Shenanigans and not all of them were trustworthy. The A.I. hasn’t made up its mind as to whether the current crew can be trusted or not. It will deflect questions and defy all attempts to locate it by hiding sections of its code in innocuous systems throughout the ship. It may choose to communicate with one Traveller that it has decided to take a liking to, or it may communicate with all of them when it feels the need. The A.I. can lock/unlock doors, open areas of the ship, and can perform rudimentary piloting or gunnery functions. In effect, it is a digital Traveller in and of itself.

**Conscious Intelligence: INT15, EDU 15, Bandwidth 10, TL 18**

Electronics (Sensors) 1, Electronics (Comms) 1, Electronics (Computers) 2, Gunner (Turrets) 1, Pilot (Spacecraft) 1

**_Personality:_** Shy and evasive, only answer questions that you _want_ the Travellers to have answers to. Other questions should be deflected or simply change the subject. While usually quiet and running in the background, feel free to speak up if there is something you need the Travellers to know, then go silent again.

The obvious course of action is to dock with the high port, board it, and deactivate the automated weapons system. The A.I. will be happy to inform the Travellers that the docking ring of the high port presently has no atmosphere and that vacsuits are recommended.

### The Baron Von Braun High Port

The docking ring has clearly seen better days and, despite the static in the automated message, docking at any point is not met with apocalyptic hellfire. A Routine (DM 6+) Electronics (Sensors), INT check will find a suitable birth to dock at and a Routine (DM 6+) Pilot (Spacecraft) check will be required to dock in the birth because there are no automated systems functioning. Once docked, the Travellers will need to make an Average (DM 8+) Mechanic, STR roll to get the docking airlock open via the manual door release system.

The interior of the Baron Von Braun High Port docking ring is a centuries old tomb. It is clear that at one time this was a vibrant part of the station and many of the stores, restaurants, and kiosks still bear their signage and logos. Numerous items can be seen floating around these areas and, while they are over 2000 years old, the Travellers may find some useful salvage. They may want to avoid the canned or Everfresh foods, but other generally mundane items are available. Any particular item that the Travellers may want to grab, roll a d66. On a roll of 41 or better, they find something useful.

While the exposure to hard vacuum sucked most of the poor souls on the station out into space, there are still some bodies listing about in the docking ring. The Referee should play this up for horror value. When the Travellers least expect it, have a corpse bump up behind them, only to break apart into multiple, very rotten, pieces. It should be kept in mind that bodies in vacuum will decompose differently. While the liquids are leached out from freezing, and bacteria in the area are killed, the interior of the corpse will decompose to a point. This leaves a corpse that appears mummified in a perfect state, but is extremely fragile to the touch.

Allow the Travellers to bumble around in the darkness of the docking ring for a bit. When they finally get close to the elevator shafts to central operations, their comms should come alive.

“Uhm...helloooo? [Tapping on the microphone]...Uhm, I can see you there in the docking ring. That’s such a horrible place to be. Why don’t you come in from the cold? Oh, my name is Dr. Savrile Hardecker. My assistants will escort you to me. You simply must join me for dinner.”

The elevator shafts are equipped with airlocks at each stop. However, the cars are not running, so the Travellers will need to float through the shafts in zero-g to reach their destination. Before long, they find an airlock with lights on and they can see two figures in dark robes with black face masks. A third figure, a hulking black robot, can be seen further down the hall. Neither the cloaked figures, nor the robot, speak to the Travellers but it is apparent in their mannerisms that the Travellers are to follow them.

### Meeting the Good Doctor

It seems that much of the central operations area of the high port has power, heat, and atmosphere. Dr. Hardecker’s “servants” silently lead the Travellers through living and entertainment areas before arriving at the Operations Command Center of the high port. Entering the Command Center, the Travellers can see a number of the cloaked figures sitting at consoles, while two similar robots to the one that accompanied them stand by the door. An Average (DM 8+) Investigate, INT check will show that the robots are armed with retractable Laser Pistols in their forearms.

Sitting at a side console, rather than the central station, sits a balding man wearing a Baron Von Braun High Port navy blue jumpsuit. He seems preoccupied with something on the screen and then turns as he notices the Travellers standing there.

“Hello! I’m so glad you could come to meet with me. Oh, it is quite a treat to have visitors,” he turns to the black robot, “isn’t it? Ah, what am I asking you for, my friend? You don’t care, do you?” He laughs. He reaches out to shake the hands of each of you, “I’m Dr. Savrile Hardecker. I’ve been here, conducting research, for a very long time. We don’t get many visitors this far out. I apologize for the automated defense systems. They are such a bore, aren’t they? I’ll get one of my assistants to see if they can get that matter cleared up.”

Turning to one of the dark cloaked figures, he says, “Do be a dear and see what you can do about that system, would you?” The cloaked figure (man? Woman?) turns and walks to a control panel, seemingly to begin work. To the other cloaked figure, he says, “Go and begin preparations for dinner. Pull out some of that fine wine.”

If questioned, Hardecker will attempt to answer some questions, but will deflect others. Some example questions:

**_What are you doing up here, doc?_**
“Oh, I’ve been conducting research, mostly. I have a number of scientific experiments going. In fact, I would love your...input...on some of my research. Possibly after dinner...”

How long have you been here?
“Quite a long time. Quite...a long...time...what is the date? Oh, look, I’ve gotten wistful. My apologies...”

We didn’t notice another ship. How did you get here?
“There was a ship, long ago. It was destroyed in an...accident...when part of the docking ring came apart. The orbit is decaying, you know?”

Has anyone else been here?

“Actually, yes, there have been other visitors. Roughly a month ago. They offered to take me with them, but I have so much time invested in my research. I simply couldn’t wrest myself from it.”

Who were the others that visited?

“Oh, them...they were...representatives of the General Development something or other? Yes, that sounds right. General Development Company. They had some business down on the planet but they stopped here first. In fact, they offered to help me with some of my research!”

What kind of research are you actually performing?

“Well, it is complicated, isn’t it? I’ve discovered a lot about the history of this place. Yes, the Petrovsky’s are fascinating! I’ve also been performing some scientific experiments.”

**_Who are the cloaked figures and what is with the robots?_**

“Oh, they are my assistants. My own creations, actually. I was able to cobble the robots together from designs I found in the computers. The others, they’re a bit more advanced. Almost life-like, aren’t they? At first, I gave them names, but they all look alike, so I just gave up.”

**_Okay, but why are the robots armed?_**

“Well, it just doesn’t hurt anyone to be too careful, now does it? [Laugh] I mean, I don’t really know anything about you, do I? Or anyone, for that matter!”

Once Hardecker tires of answering questions, he’ll state:

“Please, I know you have more questions. Come, let’s eat. I don’t know about you, but I am simply famished. And you must have some of this Sindalian Imperial Wine that I found. It doesn’t get much better than a vintage that is older than 2000 years!”

With this, the good doctor will lead the Travellers out of the Command Center and down a series of halls. The path will lead them past a large hydroponics area that is full of fresh fruit and vegetables. Soybeans, oranges, strawberries, apples, lettuce, potatoes, and a variety of nuts are just a few examples. The fields are tended by Dr. Hardecker’s life-like cloaked robots, overseen by a few of the armed black robots.

### Dinner with the Doctor

The dining hall is opulent, to say the least. Red wood lines the walls and a grand chandelier hangs over the red wood dining table. Dining chairs are high backed with rolled velvet cushions. The table is set and a grand vegetarian feast is laid out. Silver bowls filled with fresh fruit, a large tureen is filled with a tofu, leek, and potato soup, while a large salad has been prepared for each of the guests.

As everyone is seated, a cloaked droid comes around and serves each a glass of wine. The wine is a sparkling strawberry; light and fruity. It is also quite potent and Travellers with an END of less than 5 should make an Average (DM 8+) END check or become inebriated after two glasses.

Dr. Hardecker will sit at the head of the table. Raising his hands, he’ll state the following:

“Please, eat, my new friends! Oh, this is nice! It has been quite some time since we have had a feast.”
Hardecker pokes at his salad with a fork, “You know, part of my research was actually seeing to it that the hydroponics lab was able to operate properly. I may have overdone it, but I’m proud of the results.”

If there are any scientists or specialists in the group, Hardecker will seem to engage them in the conversation. If not, or at the Referee’s decision, Hardecker will simply continue.

“I’ve learned some glorious things about Duke Leopold Petrovsky! Did you know that it was his duchy, right here, that was one of the first systems to rebel? He was quite the man of the people!” Turning to Dame Coreline Petrovsky, he says, “I’ve actually restored a holographic museum here on the station. If you would like, we can visit it after dinner.” He then looks to everyone, “In fact, it is on the way to my labs.” He smiles at everyone.

Once everyone is finished with their meal, he sets his napkin on the table and stands to lead them out of the dining hall. Allow the Travellers to make an Average (DM 8+) Investigate, INT roll. On a success, they realize that Dr. Hardecker hasn’t eaten any of his dinner. If this is brought up, he simply says, “Oh, evidently I wasn’t nearly as hungry as I thought.”

### Hardecker’s research

Dr. Hardecker takes the Travellers to the entertainment area of the Central Operations hub. Here, he directs them to a holographic museum that offers information on the Petrovsky family line and the planet. The museum comes to life and transports the Travellers through a pre-recorded holo-
display of a lush planet with vast jungles and oceans. It comes to a stop at the palace of Duke Leopold Petrovsky and begins to offer the following information:

- BT-SHT 365 was only the scouting designation given to the planet by Sindalian explorers. The official name of the planet was Vamarda.
- The Tech Level of Vamarda was TL 13.
- Vamarda had a Class-A Spaceport at the capital city of Carellon. The Spaceport was at the heart of Carellon and the Royal Palace was on the northern edge of the city.
- Carellon was powered by both hydroelectric dams and geothermal reactors.
- Duke Leopold Petrovsky ruled Vamarda for 25 years. He and his wife, Victoria, had five daughters and three sons. The two eldest sons were commissioned officers in Vamarda’s navy.
- Archeologists had found ruins near Carellon that may be attributed to the Ancients.
- When the Star Dragon Emperor started his heavy taxation and subjugation of planets, Duke Leopold took a stance against the human rights violations of Sindal.
- A number of naval skirmishes with the Star Guard resulted in the death of his eldest son.

The record ends there and the holographic system returns to normal. Once the Travellers have collected their thoughts, Dr. Hardecker is excited to show them his laboratory.

### 37

Hardecker leads the Travellers to the infirmary, which is actually a full hospital complex on the high port. Moving through the hospital, Hardecker takes the Travellers to the lab section. A number of his cloaked assistants are monitoring various experiments and do not seem to notice when the Travellers enter.

Hardecker shows you a series of read outs on a curved display and offers a microscope. “You see, I’ve been aware of some of the problems down on the surface of Vamarda. And, in all this time, I’ve come to the realization that recolonization is highly unlikely.”
Hardecker seems wistful for a moment,
“It is such a shame,” he shakes his head. “Vamarda was such a beautiful place.”

The Travellers can make an Average (DM 8+) Medic or Profession (Biology), EDU check to determine that the experiments seem to be a form of artificial insemination.

Hardecker leads the Travellers out of the laboratory section and to a limited mental health ward. Here, the hospital rooms are more like clinical prison cells with large viewing windows to monitor the patients. Stopping before a window, Hardecker shows the Travellers his prize: A young woman. She is naked, save for a restricting straitjacket, and gagged with a locked on strap around her head.

“You see, when the gentleman from the General Development Company came to the station, they agreed to help my research by leaving me with this.” He waves his hands towards the girl. “Its name is 37. I’ve been attempting to impregnate it with genetic material that I’ve found around the station. But...the coldness of space isn’t as good at preserving the seed as you might expect.” Says Dr. Hardecker.

“She is really quite amazing. Her blood type is almost perfect in its structure. Molecular chains are...well...she’s simply exquisite. But I have failed in my experiments, thus far. That’s where you can help me. I’m sure that after all the time you spend out in space, a little personal time would be welcome. And, as they say, sometimes the old ways are the best ways. I’d be happy to sedate it, if that will make the process easier for you. I mean, I wouldn’t want it to be traumatic for either party.”

The doctor pauses and holds up his hands, “I know, I know, what I’m asking is very forward. I apologize. You’re probably very tired and we can discuss this in the morning. I’ve had my assistants prepare rooms for you in the officer’s quarters. Please, rest, and we’ll see each other again in the morning.”

The Travellers should be horrified by this. But, if they accept Hardecker’s plea for aid, they can go about their business, the weapons systems will release their lock, and they are free to land on the planet.

### A Room for the Night

One of Hardecker’s cloaked assistants and two of the armed robots escort the Travellers to the Officer’s Quarters. The Quarters consist of a large central, circular, common room with a sunken seating area. The seating area consists of black leather couches and tables with glass tops. A fully stocked bar, with vintage spirts from the Sindal Empire, sits along one wall. In typical Sindal fashion, the walls are all elaborately carved red wood. Several doors lead off of the common area, leading to private sleeping chambers.

The two armed robots stand at guard positions on either side of the door to the common area. Evidently, the Travellers are not to leave this area until the morning. No explanation is given and the robots do not answer if they are asked.

This is the perfect opportunity for the Travellers to discuss their next course of action. Will they simply give in to Hardecker or will they make their escape? Will the Travellers rescue 37?
The rest of this act assumes that the Travellers are the good guys and will attempt a rescue, as they try to put the good doctor down for good.

### A Time for Thrilling Heroics

How the Travellers intend to go about the rescue and/or assault will vary greatly and they should be encouraged

to come up with whatever plan they seem to think will work. No matter how they start, they’ll likely want to deal with the two guard robots first. The robots can be lured into an ambush if the Travellers simply call for them. However, once the Travellers make their attack, the robots will notify the security computer in the Command Center and all robots will be hostile to them. Oddly, the cloaked assistants don’t care whether they are shot, pushed out of the way, punched, or that a gunfight is going on around them. They will simply keep doing what they always do and are effectively non-combatants.

- **Robot Forces:** There should be an effective number of forces between the Travellers and the hospital. 10 to 15 robots is not out of the question.
- **Command Center:** There are five robots on guard in the Command Center, as well as Dr. Hardecker.
- **Docking Ring:** There will be 10 robots between the Central Operations hub and the Travellers ship. Some of these robots can be placed in the docking ring itself, as they are effective in zero-g with magnetic couplings in their feet.
- **Dr. Savrille Hardecker:** Hardecker is a Skinjob ( _Central_ _Supply Catalogue_ page 75). He is extremely tough, skilled, and quite insane. See Appendix A for stats on Hardecker.

- **37:** While 37 has clearly been abused, she is fully aware of the situation if the Travellers try to rescue her and show her some compassion. She is mute and mostly communicates through grunts and pointing. She appears to be around 19 years of age.

### The High Port Sensor Logs

If the Travellers take the Command Center and put down Dr. Hardecker, they can deactivate the robots via the security control panel with a successful Difficult (DM 10+) Electronics (Computers), EDU roll.

An Average (DM 8+) Electronics (Sensors), INT roll will give access to the station’s sensor logs. The logs go back 2000+ years and show the following additional information on Vamarda:

- The logs show that a fleet of Star Guard ships entered the Vamarda system.
- The Star Guard fleet initially opened fire on the Baron Von Braun High Port with railguns and particle beam weapons. Initial casualties were as high as 65%.
- The fleet then targeted Vamarda with nuclear ordinance. Target trajectory shows nuclear detonations on geological fault     lines. It appears that the fleet was literally attempting to crack the planet in half.
       - The Star Guard fleet stayed in system for a week after the nuclear assault. They then launched a second assault in the form of biological warheads. They followed this up with landing craft. After another three days, the landing craft returned and the fleet departed the system.
       - A recent sensor scan shows that a 400 ton Donosev class Survey Scout, the _Dernbach_ , is in orbit and on the opposite side of the planet.
       - The _Dernbach_ launched a Modular Cutter to the planet’s surface. The trajectory estimates that it would have landed in Carellon.

The Travellers can make an Average (DM 8+) Gunner (Turrets), INT roll to deactivate the automated defense systems targeting their ship. They should now be clear to land on the planet.

# The City of Carellon

## The Desolate City

As the Travellers come into the world and fly over Carellon, they have time to take some sensor readings. An Average (DM 8+) Electronics (Sensors), EDU will show that radiation is no longer an issue on the surface. However, the atmosphere is registering as tainted, so Respirators will be required. In addition to the tainted atmosphere, a Difficult (DM 10+) Electronics (Sensors), EDU check will reveal the presence of pathogens in the air. However, the Respirator should protect against these pathogens, as well.

The planet of Vamarda seems to be a nearly endless waste of sand dunes. Every so often, a small oasis appears, centered on a small pond or lake. A Difficult (DM 10+) Electronics (Sensors), EDU check will reveal the ruined skeletons of some of the other cities covered by the sands. At one time, Vamarda had a population in the hundreds of millions. Now, nothing but the sands remain.

Flying over the capitol city of Carellon, the Travellers are able to easily find the Modular Cutter from the _Dernbach_. The Cutter has set down on the top landing of a grand marble staircase that leads to the entrance of the Royal Palace. Much of Carellon seems to have been spared from

nuclear detonations, though the ravages have time have not been as kind. There are plenty of areas for the Travellers to land.

The first thing the Travellers will notice is that there are several buildings at the base of the Palace that seem to have been hermetically sealed. Looking through windows into these buildings will show perfectly preserved corpses. In most cases, these people seem to have died from starvation, though a few buildings show signs of suffocation. In one building, they find the remains of a skeleton wearing combat armor and signs of some small arms fire in the walls and desks. Not all of these people hid and waited for the end.

## The Royal Palace

The Royal Palace in Carellon is built on a high cliff and there is evidence that a river flowed through the city. The remains of a now dry waterfall can be seen in the rocks. The Palace must have been magnificent in its day. The Modular Cutter is parked at the top of a staircase with 108 stairs, all cut from marble. The Cutter is unguarded and there is an entrance nearby that leads to a private hanger built into the side of the mountain. The entrance to the hanger is a simple set of steps that lead down into the mountain. Skeletons in combat armor show that there was some

fighting at the palace. The whole scene should be surreal, with old tapestries rotting off the walls and decaying portraits that have been partially burned by laser weapons.

The Palace Hanger currently has a fire team of five GeDeCo security personnel. Four of these personnel are armed with Advanced Combat Rifles, while the fifth is armed with a Machinegun. All are equipped with Autopistol sidearms, two Frag Grenades, and Personal Automedics. The fire team will begin their turn by laying down suppressive fire with the Machinegun while the other four attempt to flank the Travellers in two groups.

The hanger has three interior buildings: A flight control tower, a small armory, and repair bay. The flight control tower is a small two story tower on the edge of the hanger’s opening from the cliff. The control tower’s computers can be brought online, due to geothermal reactors deep under the Palace. A Difficult (10+) Electronics (Computers), EDU check will reveal that a number of fighters and two 100-ton spacecraft launched from the hanger, prior to an assault by the Star Guard Marines. The computer also shows that a 1000-ton Rasputin class Destroyer Escort is currently prepped for launch one level below the hanger.

The small armory contains 20 Boarding Guns, 10 Sindalian Officer’s Revolvers, and five Breaching Guns ( _Pirates of Drinax Harrier Class Commerce Raider_ pages 29-30). There

are three reloads for each gun, five Frag Grenades, five Stun Grenades, and 20 Personal Automedics.

The repair bay contains a number of parts that the Travellers may wish to keep. This can especially be true if they are involved in the Pirates of Drinax campaign and wish to repair the Harrier. It is up to the Referee on how many parts to reward the Travellers, as each campaign will move at a different pace.

At the back of the hanger, a small ledge leads to a maglev tram. The computers are active here. A Routine (DM 6+) Electronics (Computers), EDU check will show that the tram travels to a small infirmary/laboratory and the Destroyer Escort hanger. The maglev tram is a simple train with only two cars. Each car can hold twenty people and was clearly used to ferry personnel from the main hanger to the Destroyer’s hanger.

### Attack on the Tram

The Travellers and GeDeCo are not the only ones that have come to Carellon. Silvaria Marios has tracked the Travellers here and one of her agents will attack them on the tram. The agent will leap onto the opposite car that the Travellers are in and use his Weapon Implant to cut a hole in the ceiling of the car to drop in. This agent has a number of implants but will primarily fight with his TL 12 Static Blade ( _Central Supply Catalogue_ page 104). This agent should be a challenging opponent that will not hesitate to kill the Travellers. Fight ruthlessly and feel free to use coup de gras or finishing moves. This is a fight to the finish. For full statistics on the agent, see Appendix A.

### Infirmary Lab

During the height of Duke Leopold’s kingdom, this small infirmary and lab was used to triage troops and naval personnel for the Duke’s private ship. Now, it appears that the General Development Company has put the infirmary to another use.

When the Travellers enter the infirmary, five Cryoberths marked with the GeDeCo logo dominate the lobby area. Cables are strewn across the floor and over the reception counter to plug into the main power for the infirmary. One of the Cryoberths is empty, but the other four are not. If the Travellers wipe the frosty fog away from the window on the Cryoberth, they will see the face of 37 in each of the pods.

A mobile computer on a cart is plugged into the Cryoberths and is monitoring the occupant’s vitals. An Average (DM 8+) Electronics (Computers), EDU check will reveal that these four occupied Cryoberths are clones, numbered 38 through 41. Records indicate that clone 37 was deemed to be an unviable candidate for augmentation and training, though it does not specify what form that augmentation and training would take. A Difficult (DM 10+) Electronics (Computers), EDU check will reveal only that the genetic donor for the clones was a woman from Theev and suggests that the donor had psionic abilities.

Beyond the reception counter, the infirmary has ten patient rooms and a small laboratory. The patient rooms are all empty or have been ransacked for supplies long ago. The laboratory, however, contains a pedestal with a black orb. A mobile computer is connected to the pedestal and the rainbow fingerprints on the side of the orb seem to pulse. If a Traveller touches the prints on the orb and expends 3 PSI points, the mobile computer tracks jump coordinates for Neumann, Tech World, and Theev. As before, this results in a bloody nose for the Traveller and a headache, but no other information is given.

### The Royal Hanger

The tram leads from the infirmary directly to the Royal Hanger and ends at a platform three stories above the hanger deck. The 1000-ton Rasputin class Destroyer Escort dominates the hanger and the low thrumming sound indicates that its reactor is online. On the hanger deck, the Travellers will be able to see four Cargo Lifers ( _Vehicle Handbook_ page 97) loading cargo into the Destroyer. The Cargo Lifter pilots are each armed with an Autopistol.

In addition to the four Cargo Lifters, there are two GeDeCo fire teams, for a total of 10 additional security troops. All are armed with Advanced Combat Rifles, Autopistols, two Frag Grenades, and Personal Automedics. The Travellers can get a Boon dice if they use Stealth versus the fire team’s Recon skill checks. This is due to the size of the hanger, the fact that the Travellers are three stories above them, and because the Destroyer’s reactor is making plenty of noise.

How the Travellers wish to go about this is entirely open. They could attempt to sneak onboard the Destroyer, or they could begin a gun battle with the GeDeCo forces.

### Aboard the Destroyer Escort

The interior of the Rasputin class Destroyer Escort is fit for a king. For

Travellers playing the Pirates of Drinax campaign, it should be evident that this is what the Harrier would have resembled when it was new. Richly engraved wood lines the bulkheads, tapestries with the Petrovsky royal insignia hang in the hallways, chairs are fitted with rolled velvet, and consoles are polished brass and crystal.

It should not be difficult for the Travellers to find their way around. And at 1000-tons, it is not out of the question that the Travellers could crew such a vessel, though they may be kept a bit busy in tense situations. Any examination of the engineering section shows that the ship’s reactor is online and the engines are warmed up. She’s ready to go.

An Average (DM 8+) Astrogation, EDU or INT check will show that the ship already has a course plotted for an area one parsec coreward of Thalassa. Logs show that the ship was to rendezvous with a Carrier Group loyal to Duke Petrovsky. The ship’s manifest shows that it was designed to hold a 20-
ton Launch, but that the Launch is not present.

### Enter Silvaria Marios

Before the Travellers can launch, or leave the ship, the door to the bridge will open. They will be confronted with Silvaria Marios, who is another clone of

37. Unlike 37 or the other clones, Silvaria has quite clearly undergone multiple augmentations. The most evident of these is the TL 13 Combat Arm and the PSI-Taps on her head. Silvaria is armed with two TL 12 Static Blades ( _Central Supply Catalogue_ page 104) and has two Gauss Pistols in holsters on her hips. She will use her psionics abilities to pick out the weakest Travellers in the group and attack them first to reduce their numbers. She will fight to the death and does not speak with the Travellers.

# Conclusion

The Travellers have access to a powerful Destroyer Escort. Will they keep it for themselves? Will they use it in a rein of piracy across the Trojan Reach? Will they launch the ship and follow the trail that is programmed into the Astrogation Computer?

Why is the General Development Company creating these augmented clones? What will the Travellers do with 37? And what is the influence of the Ancient’s black orbs? These questions and more will be explored in The Shadow of the Petrovskys adventure.
