# Duchess Colyere Hajesta daMae

Even in an empire with trillions of sophonts, there are outsized personalities who dominate worlds, subsectors and sometimes even entire sectors. Such is the case in the Ch’naar subsector where the Duchess Colyere Hajesta daMae of [[Aursis]] rules the roost. The duchess has had a distinguished – if controversial – career, starting with her military service. Born to the nobility on Cobham in the Old Expanses, daMae’s family had a multi-generational history of service in the Imperial Navy. Young Colyere created a stir by breaking tradition and opting for service in the Imperial Marines where she fought in brushfire wars against Solomani insurgents on the Imperial border, rising to the rank of brigadier by the age of 30. Despite the misgivings of her family, there could be no doubt that Colyere was a born leader.

After retirement from the military, she became the matriarch of her family and countess of her homeworld. She was sent to Capital to join the deliberative body of the Moot. Colyere had a talent – some would say a misguided one – for boiling issues down to their basic elements and cutting through any red tape that got in her way. Her abrasive style got her into conflicts with her fellow nobles, a few which came to fisticuffs, and it soon became obvious that if the Moot Spire were going to remain standing, Colyere would have to be reassigned.

Emperor Strephon learned to rely upon Colyere to give him uncensored opinions about a number of issues including what she thought of his leadership style. Most of the peerage kowtow to the Emperor and there are few among them willing to tell him exactly what they think, which makes nobles like Colyere invaluable. After problems with Chanestin insurgents began to plague Ch’naar, the Moot reassigned its subsector duke and put Colyere in his place, purportedly at the behest of the Emperor. That was 20 years ago and things have changed dramatically since then.

Colyere is a large and intimidating woman who usually has a scowl or sneer on her face. She is an aging lioness but one who still has a considerable bite. She refuses to use anagathics to preserve her youth but maintains a strict dietary and exercise regimen and consumes high-tech nutrient supplements in an effort to stay fit as a fiddle.
