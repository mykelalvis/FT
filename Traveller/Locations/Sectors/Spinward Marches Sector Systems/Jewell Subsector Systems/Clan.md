# Details

The Clan system comprises of five planets, one of which is a gas giant. Clan is the fourth planet from the sun. The three remaining planets are small, lifeless and have no available resources.

Clan 0303 B672899â€“A Z Z G Clan was the first world in the Jewell subsector to be colonized by the [[Zhodani]] in 320. Witnessing the expansion of the Imperium, the Consulate saw the benefit in establishing their borders before the [[Imperium]] dominated the subsector.

Many colonists settled on Clan to help establish the [[Zhodani]] presence in Jewell. Clan is not a world abundant with water, so agricultural areas are limited. There is also little in the way of minerals and other resources but the population of half a billion people have always managed to sustain themselves. Once the [[Zhodani]] had established additional colonies in neighboring systems, the economy on Clan began to thrive as it became the centre for [[Zhodani]] trade and commerce in Jewell.

Using Clan as a staging point, the [[Zhodani]] spread out to neighboring systems to control the coreward region of the subsector. Being both a border world and central to [[Zhodani]] systems in Jewell, Clan has become a hub world for trade and military deployment. Clan has the largest [[Zhodani]] base in Jewell, which was built to serve as a nexus to the other [[Zhodani]] outposts in this subsector.

# ATTITUDES

Clan is the [[Zhodani]] centre of trade in the Jewell subsector, so the people here are more tolerant of other races than is typical of their race. Imperial citizens are sometimes viewed with some suspicion but the economy of Clan thrives on commerce so any trade is welcomed.

# LAWS

All weapons and explosives are considered contraband on Clan and any personal arms must be kept on the ship. All non-medical drugs and offworld data are also illegal on Clan.
