## Tree Kraken

_(Hexapoda srrenii, H. silvans)_

![[JTAS-01-090.jpg]]

The tree kraken is native to the planet Forboldn in the Spinward Marches but can be found on many small, low gravity worlds. An adult tree kraken weighs six kilograms and resembles an octopus, having a central body sensory cluster and six radiating tentacle-like arms.

The internal skeleton is rudimentary, consisting of a cartilaginous stiffening of the body to permit lung sacs to function, serve as an attachment points for the muscles, and permit leverage for the three part mandible located at the base of the arms.

The arms of the kraken consist of a stiffened central support structure surrounded by a muscular sheath. The arms end in between two and seven (depending on species) smaller appendages, while the ventral surface of the arm and ends of these smaller appendages are equipped with a disc-shaped sucker-like organ covered with hundreds of small, razor-sharp tooth-like structures.

Eyes are paired, operate stereoscopically, and permit the kraken to detect the faintest movement at several hundred meters. Range judgement is extremely good.

Respiration is accomplished by three to eight (again, varying with species) lung sacs located in the body mass, each with its own connection to the atmosphere. To function, the inner lining of each sac must be kept moist, requiring the kraken to remain in regions of high humidity, such as marshes, swamps or jungles. Tree krakens have a closed circulatory system and are endothermic.

The kraken attacks its prey by leaping upon it from a height, usually a tree but often a cliff and, occasionally, a roof. The arms wrap around the prey, immobilising it and the disc-shaped structures abrade the skin and other tissue into small fragments that are conveyed to the mouth. After feeding, the tree kraken climbs to a high place for protection from other predators and goes into a digestive torpor, from which it emerges several hours later.

Krakens are hermaphroditic and reproduction is accomplished by budding. During the six week mating season, two krakens will meet and exchange genetic material by means of two tube-like structures located above the eyes. After fertilization these structures swell to several times their normal size and grow arms, eventually (after 8-12 weeks) becoming fully developed miniature krakens. When fully developed, the young detach themselves and go their own way. This is accomplished when the parent is in a state of torpor after feeding, as krakens will eat their own young.
