# The Sword Worlds Confederation

One of the big questions in [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]] is this: which is correct? The [[Sword Worlds]] _is_ , or the [[Sword Worlds]] _are_? The Sword Worlders themselves seem unable to decide, which implies the latter is true.

The Sword Worlds Confederation is a very loose alliance whose members spend much of their time arguing or jostling for position. Individual governments tend to pursue their own agendas, even when a cooperative effort being made. Joint ventures are usually short-lived, although a charismatic individual can sometimes hold things together where a paper agreement would simply fall apart.

As a result, unless there is a severe external threat or major opportunity, Sword Worlder activity tends to be disjointed. When the Confederation acts as a whole, it can do so with a surprising degree of unity in the short term. Naval and military assets, which normally belong to the individual worlds, are pooled under central command and, once a chain of command is established (which can be a difficult process), the combined fleet can be expected to follow orders whatever local agendas may be in place.

One reason for this is that, although the Sword Worlds Confederation resembles a dysfunctional family with feuds and jealousies, it is still a family. Almost any rivalry or dispute can be set aside while a threat to the Confederation is dealt with.

However, in peacetime, this means that vessels ostensibly belonging to the Sword Worlds Confederation Navy must be thought of as serving their own homeworld first and foremost. To an outsider, a patrol vessel out of Gram might look just like one out of Narsil but their captains have very different priorities.

Imperials find the Sword Worlders difficult to deal with (and vice versa) due to cultural differences. Sword Worlders are chauvinistic (some would instead say extremely protective) towards women and find it hard to accept Imperial females in positions of responsibility or power. They come over as haughty and arrogant, and look down on those who do not meet their standards.

The Sword Worlds Confederation is politically unfriendly to the [[Imperium]] and Darrian Confederation; this does not mean actively hostile or stupid. The Sword Worlders do not want a war with the [[Imperium]], in which their vessels would be overmatched in both numbers and technology, and do not deliberately provoke the Imperials. They will not, however, allow themselves to be pushed around.

Passing through Sword Worlder space thus tends to be unpleasant and difficult rather than dangerous for most minor ship operators such as free traders, and expensive for the bigger lines. Those that have won the respect of the Sword Worlders, on the other hand, are treated as old friends and find a warm welcome among their Sword Worlder brothers-in-all-but-blood.

It is not possible to describe an over-arching Sword Worlds Confederation plan for the future, other than to say that the [[Sword Worlds]] want to be left alone to captain their own fate. Exactly what each world is planning at any given time varies greatly.

The [[Sword Worlds]] owns the four so-called Metal Worlds (Iron, Bronze, Mithril and Steel) but has not done much with them. They are designated as reserve worlds in much the same way the [[Imperium]] earmarks uninhabited worlds for future development when the means are available or need arises. As yet, there has been little activity and an expression of interest by the Imperial Colonial Office in developing one or more of the worlds has not been rebuffed by the Sword Worlders.
