# Kamlar

Kamlar was acquired as a colony by [[Pikha]] early in the Imperial expansion into the region. Plans to develop the world never really came to anything but [[Pihka]] is reluctant to let the possession go or permit outsiders to get involved in its development. As a result, most of the world is untamed wilderness, with a diverse and flourishing ecosystem containing a mix of indigenous and introduced species. It is extensively covered in water, possessing three great oceans. The dense atmosphere ensures rainfall is heavy in most regions and many low-lying areas are chronically waterlogged. This suits the local wildlife; Kamlar has many amphibian species of which some are very dangerous.

Away from the wetlands, dense forest predominates in non-mountainous areas. The forests and high peaks alike are home to a vast array of flying creatures, most unique to the world. A few flying species have moved into the small cities of Kamlar, nesting atop tall buildings and occasionally posing a hazard to grav traffic.

The cities are home to almost all of Kamlar's human population, with just a few thousand dwelling in outlying regions. Most are employed in tourism or tourism-related industries; some visitors want to hunt – which can be really quite dangerous – whilst others would be distressed at coming across a successful hunting party.  The solution is to separate these activities, which also dictates how the local wildlife is controlled. Sporting reservations are kept clear of dangerous animals as far as possible, whilst teams capture and move the most impressive into the hunting reserves.
