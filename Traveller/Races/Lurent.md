### The Lurent

The Lurent are a minor race native to [[Borlund]] but their trade ships are sufficiently widespread that they have become a power of sorts in the sector's politics.

By the time the [[Imperium]] contacted them, the Lurent had reached TL8 and were already outfitting planetoid ships to undertake mining operations in their outsystem and Oort cloud. Trade with the [[Imperium]] allowed the Lurent to quickly attain TL9, and soon planetoid ships had been outfitted with jump drives.

Lurent planetoid vessels are typically enormous, being mobile bases rather than starships. A given vessel may have a population in the tens of millions, including non-Lurent. Rather than proceeding directly to a mainworld, these wandering planetoid colonies usually emerge near a star system's Oort cloud, to refuel and negotiate trade agreements with potential clients. Trade is undertaken by sublight craft, although sometimes conventional jump-capable ships are used for in-system transits.

In some systems, especially those with very bright stars, the Lurent may remain in the outsystem for the duration of their stay. Elsewhere, their gigantic ship will slowly spiral inward, eventually taking up orbit around one of the system's major planets. The Lurent rarely seem to be in a hurry; a planetoid ship might spend years in a system's Oort cloud, conducting long-range trade, and then suddenly jump out for an unknown destination.

Lurent ships do not always advertise their presence.  Some will remain in-system for years, often undetected in the far outsystem. Usually, the ship's leaders will want to trade but if they do not then the ship will go about its business without regard to outsiders. This makes some world governments suspicious but there are no records of unprovoked attacks by Lurent vessels.  When they do choose to make war, it is usually on corsairs and similarly deserving recipients, and almost always through mercenaries rather than directly.

The trading vessels of the Lurent exert considerable influence on the systems they visit and have the capability to transport personnel and even large ships across the sector without attracting attention. The Lurent are quite happy to sell this capability like any other commodity.

#### Planetoid Ships

The giant planetoid ships of the Lurent can occasionally be encountered in the inner system, or even in orbit around a mainworld, but far more commonly remain in the far outsystem or Oort cloud, sending smaller and more conventional vessels to trade with the worlds of the system.
Lurent presence is usually quite obvious, with several of their craft and ships moving back and forth, and the planetoid parent vessel broadcasting on many channels.

However, sometimes a planetoid ship will quietly move through the Oort cloud, perhaps observing local conditions before announcing its presence or ensuring it has sufficient fuel to depart before opening trade relations. It has been speculated that some ships may lie in the outsystem for years, for purposes known only to their crews. Some older Lurent planetoid ships have no jump drives and are still in the middle of a long sublight transit. The population will not be in low berths - the ship is a living community, sending those who feel the need to head homeward aboard jump-capable vessels and receiving new personnel and supplies at planned rendezvous points. More than one Lurent ship has acted as a jump bridge for years at it crosses the gap between mains at a relative crawl compared to the jump-capable ships that visit it to obtain fuel.
