Usani borders the [[Great Rift]], although most of its 30 worlds are concentrated in a single large cluster, with no outliers in the rift itself. The proximity of the rift gives the subsector what is often termed a 'hard border', a natural frontier that has influenced the development of the rest of the subsector.

Usani contains [[Deneb]], nominal capital of the sector.  This honor is largely ceremonial as there is no sector duke and the [[Duchy of Usani]] is weak compared to its rivals. There are some advantages to be had from being the sector capital however; many businesses feel there is kudos to be had from operating out of [[Deneb]] and state visits by the Imperial family have to include the sector capital. As host, the [[Duke of Usani]] has the ear of a visitor â€“ although these occasions are rare enough that the advantage is offset by the expense of maintaining a suitable set of accommodations.

The [[Duchy of Usani]] also administers [[Geniishir Subsector|Geniishir]] and [[Vast Heavens Subsector|Vast Heavens]]. Geniishir contains just four star systems, all easily reached by a jump-2 ship from Deneb. Other worlds close to these in Atsah are administered by the [[Duchy of Atsah]] but are astrographically remote from it due to the minor rift lying to coreward-trailing. The [[Duchy of Usani]] exerts some influence over these worlds, which are part of the local economy to a greater degree than that of Atsah.

The 154th Fleet, assigned to protect the subsector, has its bases towards the rimward end. It is primarily active in the central cluster, with outlying worlds receiving few patrols. Elements of the fleet are routinely sent into [[Geniishir Subsector|Geniishir]] to conduct the usual commerce-protection and flag-showing duties and occasionally make a foray into nearby worlds at the rimward end of [[Atsah Subsector|Atsah]]. This does not cause friction with the [[Duke of Atsah]] or the [[Imperial Navy]] forces assigned to the subsector; it is a logical piece of cooperation that relieves the 88th Fleet of this responsibility. However, the arrangement has at times become the victim of local politics, to the detriment of populations and Imperial fleet personnel alike.
