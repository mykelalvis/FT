Onak is a handsome and charismatic individual who was born and raised on Condyole but his adventurous nature drew him to [[Chwistyoch]] to meet more like-minded [[Vexx]]. He is young, idealistic and strongly disagrees with the imposed [[Zhodani]] rule here on Chwistyoch. He is aware that his people have benefited from the [[Zhodani]]'s presence but he dislikes the way the [[Vexx]] are treated as second class citizens.
