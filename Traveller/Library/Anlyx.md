# Anlyx

Anlyx is a Superjovian; an extremely large gas giant planet. Huge as it is, Anlyx is far short of the mass required to become a brown dwarf. It does radiate some heat into space, enough to warm its many moons a little. Anlyx has a very complex moon system, composed of four main groups and some outliers, plus an impressive ring system. The rings are in two bands, a broad inner band and a narrower outer one, separated by two small moons which are designated as the ‘midring’ moon group. There are also several small moons orbiting closer to Anlyx than its inner ring system. The exact number of moons in this ‘inner’ moon group varies according to the designation system used. Some of the smallest are counted as part of the ring system by some methods of cataloguing.

Outside the outer ring system are the nine moons of the
‘outer’ group, which vary from the size of a small planet down to asteroid sized rockballs. There are about a dozen independent moons beyond this group, and finally the ‘outlier’ cluster which comprises a body named Anlyx-Companion (usually abbreviated to Anlyx-C) and five smaller bodies. Two of these orbit Anlyx-C, two follow it in its orbit, and one seems to be in the process of being ejected or captured by Anlyx and her companion. Which it ends up orbiting, if it is not flung out into deep space first, is a matter for conjecture.

In all, Anlyx has about 30-40 moons, depending on how they are catalogued, and vast numbers of rock and ice fragments within its ring system. It is a spectacular sight as well as being interesting from a scientific viewpoint.

There are scientific outposts on several of the moons as well as mining bases. Some of these exploit the mineral wealth of the moon itself, whilst others are used as a forward base for asteroid-mining operations among the rings. Navigation among the rings and the moon systems is a complex and sometimes hazardous business, so wherever possible operations are kept local rather than sending vessels ranging far out into the rings.

Anlyx-C is inhabited, after a fashion. Its atmosphere is composed mainly of methane, but this is not an especially hazardous environment for sealed settlements or starship operations, and navigation is simple enough this far out from Anlyx itself. Anlyx-C is dotted with mining and industrial settlements, served by a central spaceport which has grown into a sizable city. Originally a manufacturing and recreation centre for the mining communities, Anlyx-C spaceport has developed far beyond expectations as a result of the tourist trade.

Some years ago, a major shipping line began offering cruises to view the spectacular rings of Anlyx, and ships would sometimes stop at the spaceport. Where there is money to be spent, someone will inevitably provide things to spend it on, and eventually the spaceport developed several high-end casinos and similarly upmarket entertainment venues. These are used by highly-paid asteroid miners as well as the tourists, but make their real money when there is a liner in port.

One recent development is the ring-cruise trade, where tourists are taken into the ring system aboard well-protected spacecraft. No liner would risk entering, and some experts say that this practice is an accident waiting to happen. However, in the meantime tourists are granted a breathtaking view of Anlyx’ ring system as they dine on fine foods and drink the best wines available. The cruise is an expensive addition to an already extravagant vacation, but those with the money say it is well worth it, and some have visited several times.
