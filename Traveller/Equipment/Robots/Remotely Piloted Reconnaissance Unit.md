# Remotely Piloted Reconnaissance Unit

![[JTAS-01-191.jpg]]
The Remotely Piloted Reconnaissance Unit, or RPRU, is known by a variety of colloquial names; most notably Spy-Eye. It is a sphere, about 50 centimeters in diameter, whose surface is studded with lenses, microphones and other detection devices. The device is primarily used for visual observations but has much broader capabilities.

Optical equipment includes a primary and several secondary cameras capable of operating in the normal spectrum or low-light conditions. A bank of thermal sensors complements them and can be used to create a composite image. It is possible to bring multiple cameras to bear on the same point, although some of the secondary cameras are positioned so as to constantly give all-round vision using fish-eye lenses.

The RPRU is also equipped with a bank of directional and general microphones. Some are specialized for certain frequencies; others are designed to give the device a basic direction-finding capability. A RPRU can eavesdrop on a normal conversation from around 50 meters away and could detect it and point out its origin from three to four times that distance. The unit can also detect ultrasonic and low-frequency vibrations.

A laser microphone is also fitted. This is normally used to listen to sounds through glass or similar materials but can also be used to measure vibrations in the ground or walls, which has applications from earthquake detection to determining what size of vehicle is passing on the far side of a wall. The RPRU's olfactory sensor can detect particles in the atmosphere down to concentrations of one part in 100,000 and can track a known scent almost as well as a dog or similar animal.

The RPRU is propelled by a gravitic unit, with a maximum speed of 200kph in normal flight and 60kph when in nap-of the-earth (NOE) low- flight mode. The device has a maximum flying time of five hours.

The RPRU can be directly controlled or sent to carry out a preset reconnaissance with limited autonomy to avoid obstacles and get into designated areas. When flying within line of sight of the operator, it is guided through a maser beam, which is extremely hard to detect. In other conditions it receives instructions on UHF frequencies, out to a maximum of about 30km depending on local conditions.

If control is interrupted the device reverts to a pre-selected instruction that may be one of several options. The device may be commanded to carry out a specific flight pattern, return to the operator, conceal itself and await further instructions, or return after a pre-set time. It can also be instructed to operate semi-autonomously in the event of control interruption but more commonly if autonomous operation is desired the unit will be told to do so from the outset.

The RPRU is programmed and operated through the Control and Reception Unit (CRU). This consists of a control panel and three fold-out display screens. The CRU is carried in a small and rugged attach√© case. It weighs 3kg and costs Cr15000, whilst the RPRU weighs 12kg. The Cr75000 price for the RPRU includes a charging station and maintenance tools. It becomes available at TL11.

Devices of this sort are frequently used by forward observers and reconnaissance personnel in military and mercenary units, with charging stations and control units sometimes mounted in light vehicles. The user interface is simple enough that most Travellers can fly an RPRU and get some information from its sensors but the Electronics (remote ops) skill is required to utilise the full capabilities of the unit.

An RPRU moves silently and has no detectable heat emissions. All its detection systems are passive and will not reveal its presence, however guidance and communication signals are detectable. The laser is unlikely to be detected as it is directional but many users choose to select autonomous mode and shut down the real-time information relay when operating a unit covertly. An RPRU that suffers catastrophic damage will make a burst transmission of everything it has recorded whilst operating covertly, unless it has been instructed not to do so or is unable. If so, the unit will have to be directly recovered or data retrieved from surviving electronics by a second RPRU or drone approaching to close range.

An RPRU is a small target, imposing DM-2 on attempts to hit it when moving normally. If instructed to evade it will bob about unpredictably, increasing the penalty to DM-6. It has Protection 4 but is quite fragile if this is penetrated; 6 points of damage will disable an RPRU and 12 points will completely wreck it.
