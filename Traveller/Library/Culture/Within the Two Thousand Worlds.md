## WITHIN THE TWO THOUSAND WORLDS

So, Human, you wish to know something of the thoughts and philosophies of The People? An odd request, that, but then, yours is an odd race, one with motivations and reasonings difficult to scent. Of what possible benefit could a knowledge of our philosophies be to you? We, The People, have our place, in the Cosmos, as do you, and there could be no advantage to either of us in sharing the viewpoints of positions so vastly sundered.

Xaxk! Fortunate it is that you have approached us instead of another family group with your request. Old K'graxk now – do you know them? No? They cannot tolerate !xengri and claim they can catch their stench at 10 kilometers. They'd never have stopped to bandy philosophy with you! But then, their family isn't as widely travelled, doesn't have that cosmopolitan... how do you say it... savoir faire ... for travel and experience ours has. We, we're tolerant of the lower species. After all, they have their place and can't help being what they are, is it not so?

And, of course, we can tell that you are not g'naak. There are, after all, respectable limits even for the cosmopolitan! No entity who has con- sumed meat would be allowed within the portals of this embassy, a fact we believe all those of your species are well acquainted with.

Are you fully aware of what K'kree olfactory senses reveal to us? We can demonstrate. You have recently consumed several beakers of water infused with the oils of a dark, coarsely powdered vegetable bean. We recognize the particular odour from other Humans we've conversed with, but don't recall the name. It is a mild stimulant to your species is it not? Also... yes... you have dined last night at the cafeteria here at the embassy. Mba roots in treer sauce, yes? A bit bland for our tastes but that seems to be a K'kree dish favored by many visiting Humans.

Oh, yes, we have little trouble reading the simple things about other species. Mmm... Further, we detect in you... behind the tainted water and mba roots... hmm... fear? Not very strong. Perhaps we should call it, instead, nervousness. Understandable, of course, in a Human granted permission to interview a noble of our rank. Also, we detect recent sexual excitement... would that be the dark-maned female of your kind who accompanied you to the... what? But of course we know! We smell traces of her pheromones mixed with yours... they are easy to detect and quite unlike any other scent you produce. It is quite obvious to us, as

obvious as that peculiar darkening of your facial skin just now. Ah... now we smell anger. You are angry? And surprised as well. You should not be so. Where you have sight as your primary sense, the K'kree count first the sense of smell and if you don't understand such a simple fact, you have no chance at all of understanding The People.

What we fail to understand about Humans, despite our years of contact with them, is their preoccupation with this intangible you call 'privacy'. We understand the technical definition of 'individual', 'sole', 'alone' and many more but full understanding of privacy escapes us. You see around us the other members of our family? Believe when we tell you that we should be most distressed to be separated from one another at any time, for any reason. Even discussing the concept disturbs us. You will notice the others here becoming concerned at my scent of agitation. We must take a moment to compose ourselves.

Now, to go on, we have studied this concept called privacy since we were first assigned here. Frankly, it amazes us that such natural functions as elimination or procreation could be regarded as activities best hidden from everyone. All creatures which ingest food must eliminate wastes, after all. What purpose is served by concealing the fact? Of all the scents of Humaniti, that associated with what you call 'embarrassment' – that sharp, almost spicy odour akin to the salty tang of fear, which we perceive in you still – that is the hardest of your smells for us to comprehend.

My dear sir, we do _not_ stray from the subject! To understand The People, you must understand what drives us but Humaniti is so alien in thought and motivation, we scarcely know where to begin. Perhaps we can give you some glimmering of the wind-swept vistas of K' kree experience by examining a few of the most important concepts.

### RIGHTNESS

K'lat'rr cannot be closely translated but gives the scent of far horizons beyond rolling and unbounded prairie, red-golden backek releasing its flowery -sweet pollen in waves before the gentle breeze, on which floats the dark, wet and ozone-tingling smell of recent thunderstorms, mingled with the wet and comforting scents of family close by. Can such a scene fail to excite you, to set both hearts pounding in joy and... and... rightness?

Rightness... belonging... these perhaps best describe K'lat'rr, which signifies that everything is in its proper place, in its proper order, as it should be. An old [[Terra|Terran]] songweaver spoke of 'God's in his heaven and

all's right with the world'. If by God he meant Ghik'keeriklk'ak T't'tkahk Xeng Kirr Tkexirr, he scented the concept with perfection.

### POSITION

That brings us to t'ok, 'position', you might call it. Surely, even Humans can scent this, yes? One has only to observe life throughout the universe; how every organism, no matter how lowly, has its place within food chains and ecosystems and the broad scheme of things. In K'kree society, each has a place, each family a place, and there is little change. For over 7,700 years the government seat of Kirur has been an example of stability, of order, of k'lat'rr... steady, steadfast, unchanging.

Eh? Freedom? What does freedom have to do with anything? Freedom is a thousand bits of chaff before the storm wind, each swept its own way. Idiocy! There's a perfect example of how Humans try to understand The People through their own preconceived and biased notions. This freedom you Humans speak of seems to us bizarre and sounds dangerous, if we understand the word. The function of a family's members is to join for the benefit of all. And each family joins with every other family for the benefit of the Herd and the Race, each with a place and position in the Grand Whole. Now, tell me, Human, where would we be if any common servant... or better, some non-K'kree kr'rrir... decided that it would be krurrunna? Unthinkable! What if we felt the freedom to strike you down where you stand? Nonsense! That's what our bodyguards are for after all... for their t'ok is to chastise at our command improprietous journalists who disrupt t'ok!

Your apology is accepted. Think nothing of it. Now, where was I?

### ORDER

T't'k – 'order' – proceeds from t'ok – 'position'. A Human would say we are 'conservative', that we mistrust things new and long delay adventures that could upset the natural order of things.

This is true enough, although the term 'conservative' in this sense seems to have a negative connotation, as though change is always good and that which holds back change is bad. Say, rather, that the new must prove itself before we embrace it, for to change merely for the sake of change is stupidity of the foulest stenched sort. T't'k gives us patience. The People have spread slowly across the stars, lacking that mindless wanderlust that brands other species we have met. This is not weakness but rather it is strength. Given the precepts of t'ok and t't'k, it could be no other way.

### THE GOOD OF ALL

If something is keek!kr, it flows from t'ok and t't'k to the good of all. It... it seems self-explanatory but you Humans are so... so... we have no word. What? Ah, yes, individualistic. We have used that word before but it is so depressing a concept. Each driven its own way, as chaff before a storm.

Keek!kr is derived from the very beginnings of The People. Primitive herds naturally evolved the idea whereby each acted first and always for the good of the whole, to ensure the herd's survival and prosperity.

Humans we have conversed with in the past have expressed surprise that in our society we have no warrior caste, drawing, we believe, parallels to certain social insects with which they are familiar. In K'kree society, _all_ adult males serve at least some time in our military... direct outgrowth from the age-old concept of keek!kr. In the primitive herds, the strong males banded together to protect the females, the aged and the young from g'naak. Later, they banded together to hunt down the g'naak, to seek them out and destroy them, acting together to free the herd from fear. This joining for the common good is so basic to our philosophy, it is difficult to explain. We've heard words used by Humans to describe this, words like 'selfless' or 'altruistic', but words such as these suggest that such behaviour is an alternative to the norm that simply cannot exist in K'kree thought or action. Keek!kr is simply another aspect of k'lat'rr and can only be explained as the way things are. That 'things' might be different among non-K'kree is one of the hardest lessons those of us who travel among other races must learn. We comfort ourselves with the knowledge that !xengr'ri cultures may yet arise to the K'kree level of social awareness. The spread of our culture has worked this miracle on countless civilizations... those we call kr'rrir... already, throughout the realm of the Two Thousand Worlds.

### UPLIFT

Yes, it is true that The People concern themselves more with their own affairs than with the affairs of others. Is it not so with Humaniti? But we are more than willing to share the gifts of our culture with those around us... yes, more than willing! The Two Thousand Worlds are filled with examples who have enjoyed rrab!ak, that is, 'uplift' and have become kr'rrir.

Our missionary outreach began long ago... at the very beginnings of our history as a space-faring people. Indeed, it is doubtful that we would have created the Two Thousand Worlds without the need to uplift others. True, true, those efforts began almost reflexively, to protect The People from the g'naak we discovered lurking on the newly discovered worlds, but we take pride in what we did as well, extending the consciousness of these races, bringing them to the benefits of true civilization and enlightenment. Our scientists have demonstrated that evolution will bring all races toward the K'kree norm given time. We are simply helping that natural process along and reducing ages of blood-soaked misery and horror. We find hope for Humaniti in the fact that many of your people began to embrace vegetarianism before you left your homeworld.

### MILITANT VEGETARIANS

Ah, yes. All Humans ask about that. Somehow, we think it is our army, our honored kirunika!rra – one of your writers translated that word as 'pest control' – which most fascinates Humans. We gather that a scientist of Terra once, long ago before [[Terra|Terran]]s had ventured to the stars to meet other civilizations, proposed that intelligence would only develop among carnivores and omnivores, his reason being summed up in the asinine phrase 'how much intelligence does it take to sneak up on a blade of grass?'.

How consistently you Humans misunderstand the workings of the cosmos.

It was the original g'naak, of course, those long-extinct predators of Kirur, which impelled the K'kree onto the path of intelligence long ago, rather than the mindless questing for food. In a way, it can be said that these g'naak themselves gave us the edge with which we supplanted them, demonstrating our superiority and our worthiness to survive. The judgement of the universe is final. There is a saying among us: 'The People have the Two Thousand Worlds, the g'naak have dust.'

The People have been called 'militant vegetarians', an epithet that twists ironically to reveal truth. The term has no translation in our language; why translate what is or build philosophies about what is self-evident? Certainly, we are vegetarians... and although we don't think of ourselves as 'militant', certainly we use militant means to induce rrab!ak among savages, for our security and for their well-being. Occasionally, when necessary, diseased cultures are eliminated and for the same reasons. Can there be a nobler cause?

What shocks and surprises Humans is our dedication to this cause. It seems that Humans expect vegetarians to be meek and gentle, horrified at the sight of blood. This expectation would be amusing if it were not so outrageously pathetic. The K'kree are not bloodthirsty; we hunt neither for food nor for so-called 'sport'. Yet when we kill, we kill efficiently, without qualm or what you would call 'conscience' – another difficult concept, that – and in the cause of K'kree well-being, we kill enthusiastically. It has been theorized that carnivores and omnivores are forced to develop certain restraints upon their behaviour as they evolve social structures, restraints that prevent them destroying themselves. Herbivores such as The People know no such restraints; they have no need of them and are far more dangerous in warfare.

We well remember a military campaign we served in some time ago. There was a Human military officer, a representative of the Solomani Sphere, observing K'kree military techniques on a world inhabited by unregenerate g'naak of the worst kind.

These... savages had rebuffed our every effort to uplift them. It seemed they claimed a biological need for... for meat, which they consumed... lightly singed. The living animals they preyed upon provided them with an amino acid unavailable in the native plant life. It was a simple matter to synthesise this compound for them but they refused to learn to do it. Certainly, there were problems storing the chemical but the truth of the matter was that the creatures _preferred_ a diet of singed meat and resented our efforts to help them!

Eh! No, not primitives, not barbarians. They had a culture, of sorts, and a crude technological civilization. They lived in cities... grotesque, alien monstrosities with kilometer-high needles and arches of a pink and white stone... and the contact families reported they had extensive literature, arts, music. But then, too, they actually hunted for sport. And they raised herds of... living animals for food... excuse us, the memory is most painful.

We are composed again. The war was a savage one. Their cities were reduced to radioactive glass, their fortresses saturated with tailored biologicals and radioactive dusts, yet still they fought on as small bands in the mountains and jungles and swamps, forcing us to eliminate them a handful at a time.

We had found an isolated shelter in the mountains. They had tried to conceal their scents as well as their visible traces but we located them in spite of their efforts. The Human was with us as we burst into the cave, to find a female and a pair of young, feeding. One of the young had blood smearing its mouth; the other was feeding on a whitish blood-like secretion from the female. Such horror! Such hideous stench of death and burnt meat! We killed them all, of course, quickly and cleanly, with our feet, to save ammunition, since they were unarmed.

What was amusing... is that a proper use of the word? What was amusing was the reaction of the Human observer, this supposedly hardened warrior, who fled the cave before we'd finished and was later found being quite ill nearby. That proved a grand amusement among our troops; you know, of course, how we nurse our own young?

Carnivores cannot match herbivores for sheer ferociousness. Carnivorous semi-sophonts take note; behold yet another example of innate K'kree biological superiority, a survival trait which will in time bring the spread of the K'kree cosmic view across the galaxy!

### MANIFEST DESTINY

This brings us at last to the final concept, a system of belief rooted in K'kree culture since earliest times.

Religion? You might call it that... although it is less religion as you know it than belief and faith. Perhaps the lower classes accord it the aura of religious belief; for we nobles, of course, fact is enough. The Human term that best fits it is 'manifest destiny' and it simply acknowledges the glorious destiny of the K'kree and our culture's principles in the cosmos.

Perhaps you are aware that The Two Thousand Worlds... the name for our empire... derives from a term indicating the night sky of Kirur? The term has nothing to do with how many worlds we hold.

Yes, with the unaided eye, it is possible to see about that many stars at one time... and it is our destiny to go forth to those worlds... really a symbol of the whole of creation... bring order and civilization, and the benefits of our peace. And why not? We have proven our ability... and our right... to survive, proven it again and again in the righteous and noble slaughter of countless g'naak species, and in the uplift of countless more. All K'kree main tain this as part of their cosmic-view, that they are destined by nature to rule, destined even to usher in a new age in planetary biology. Nothing can stop this; it is quite inevitable, basic to the entire foundation of bioevolution!

You disagree? Oh, but you do... you cannot lie to us, so why deny it?

We scent your stink of anger and fear and revulsion. It matters not to us. Perhaps you're unaware that once we were Ghir'ghik'keer!k of a world within our sphere, a world inhabited by Humans. Omnivorous Humans! We took part in their rrab!ak, their... taming... we supervised the eradication of the die hards among them and we governed the survivors for seven years after that. We watched the colony transformed from savagery to civilization and happiness. We know the benefits of the K'kree way! Well... very well, if you feel that way. The opinion of a Human can hardly matter to us. Our bodyguards will show you out... but long will be the time before we grant another interview to a Human!

It will take days to rid the compound of the last traces of your stench...
