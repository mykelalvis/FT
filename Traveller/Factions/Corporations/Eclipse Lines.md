# Eclipse Lines

Eclipse is a fairly typical ‘small-ship’ merchant line whose vessels are all named for a world or star with the word Eclipse added (e.g. Eshadi Eclipse). The firm operates a mix of standard vessels, mostly Type-R Subsidised Merchants on local routes and Type-A2 Far Traders on connecting or priority runs. Most vessels provide a scheduled service either along a main or between two points, with some ships jumping back and forth between the same two ports for years on end. The choice of runs has traditionally been skewed towards a steady flow of freight rather than passengers, and some Eclipse vessels have been converted to pure freight haulers. Most ships carry a mail safe or secure cargo area and are paid a subsidy as mail carriers by some or all of the worlds on their route.

Eclipse vessels are all armed, albeit lightly, and provide a timely and reliable service. Or rather, they did. The firm’s reputation is still intact but in recent years its activities have been increasingly disorganised. It is only a matter of time before the decades of good service are undermined by the current rather slipshod management practices. At one time it was virtually certain that a Jump-2 service from a different main or cluster would mesh perfectly with the Jump-1 ships operating in the local area, ensuring fast and efficient cargo transfers. Recently, changes in the operating schedules – apparently intended to increase efficiency or revenue generation – have caused significant disconnects in the chain.

There are no obvious reasons for this sudden outbreak of ineptitude, no management reshuffles or mass personnel replacements. The firm does seem to have had a run of bad luck exacerbated by poor decisions about how to deal with it, but again there is no real pattern to this and every questionable decision is explainable – there are no outright stupid choices being made, just an uncanny ability to pick the wrong option every time.

Eclipse is still profitable, and individual ships continue to give a generally good service, but the firm overall is on a long-term path to destruction. Its best option would be to break into smaller regional companies, but this is not a move the management are likely to consider. Instead Eclipse is moving from its normal model of low-risk freighting with some passenger work towards speculative and even exploratory trade missions outside its normal area of operations.

Eclipse has some ships suitable for this kind of work, but has created an ‘Eclipse Associate’ status for vessels undertaking exploratory trade on its behalf. These ships are in some cases chartered but more commonly operate on a profit-sharing system with subsidies from Eclipse. A few of the firm’s regular routes have been adjusted to take advantage of the new markets opened up by these vessels, and thus far the move seems to have been a successful one. However, given the generally bad fortune Eclipse has suffered in recent years many observers consider it is only a matter of time before something goes terribly awry.

Hardway Line The Hardway Shipping Line gets its name from a comment made at its inception a few years ago – ‘we’re creating a shipping line and we’re doing it the hard way.’ This was an apt statement; Hardway was formed by a group of Free Trader and other independent ship operators who banded together for mutual benefit. The firm attempts to present the image of a well- organised shipping line but many of its captains are still Free Traders at heart. Individualism often outweighs the benefits of a standard colour scheme and smart uniforms. Thus Hardway is more of a ‘family and friends’ setup than a formally organised shipping line.

Hardway has regulations in place about vessel colours and the uniforms but does not enforce them. It is far stricter about quality standards, delivering on a deal and protecting the firm’s good name. Captains who fail

to live up to its standards are initially nudged by peer pressure and then instructed to change their ways or go back to being independent. Those that do not shape up are coerced as far as the firm can manage, usually by a mix of public denunciation in the newsvids and word-of- mouth condemnation.

This is surprisingly powerful among the community of small-ship operators and users. If word gets around that Hardway kicked a captain out, that will be damning in the eyes of many since it means the skipper failed to live up to the deal he agreed with them and has essentially betrayed the trust of friends into the bargain. If that captain continues to use the Hardway logo and uniform, his status is downgraded to that of a crook and a liar in the eyes of many. Not everyone cares what is said on the grapevine, but in the areas where Hardway operates it is a useful way of getting back at former members who have misbehaved.

Hardway has no portside or planetary assets whatsoever. Everything it owns flies or is carried aboard a vessel. Its captains are its directors and the head office is located aboard the yacht Hardway Central, which was converted to an upmarket passenger carrier and re-registered as the firm’s primary asset.

Hardway has a generally good reputation. It captains are reliable and generally honest, though internal loyalty is worth more than playing fair by one-off passengers. Thus the Hardway logo is not a complete guarantee that a given captain will not overcharge or otherwise bend a deal to his benefit, but it does mean that his conduct will remain within acceptable limits.

Hardway is resented by various former members and to a lesser extent by many independent shipping operators. This is largely due to the insinuation that a captain who has not signed up with Hardway is somehow less trustworthy than one who has. Hardway states that it never intended anyone to believe this, it is just a natural consequence of the way it holds its captains to a decent standard and anyone else is welcome to build their own good reputation. It is a fair point, but the firm still has its staunch opponents. Some of these are sufficiently influential on a local level that there are some ports where Hardway vessels are not welcome.
