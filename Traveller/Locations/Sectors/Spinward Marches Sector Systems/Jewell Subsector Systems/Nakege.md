# DETAILS

Nakege 0505 D591314–2 I Lo NI Lt Nakege is a dry world with an indigenous population of around 60,000 people. The inhabitants are a human offshoot that are still in their infancy where technological advancement is concerned. The planet was of little interest to the [[Imperium]] and the people here preferred to develop on their own, so it was left alone for centuries.

During the Third Frontier War, refugees from Mongo settled on Nakege. These settlers were followed by detachments of Imperial forces in 982, who used Nakege as a staging point in their first attempt to retake Mongo.

However, before the [[Imperium]] could launch their offensive, [[Zhodani]] forces attacked Nakege with both sides suffering considerable losses. With such a failure, the [[Imperium]] did not repeat that tactic and Nakege was abandoned by the Imperium, leaving the indigenous population to rebuild their civilization.

Suffering catastrophic casualties and damage, the people of Nakege became both xenophobic and technophobic after seeing the hostility and destruction caused by the advanced races that savaged their world. They became increasingly hostile to anyone who visited Nakege and the [[Imperium]] eventually declared it an Amber world, once more allowing the inhabitants to live without interference from others.

They remained in isolation for several years until 988 when Spinward Salvage LIC expressed their interest in the planet. The battle here had left many ship and vehicle wreckages, salvage that had great value to the corporation. Spinward Salvage were initially met with hostility until they came to an agreement, whereby they agreed to enforce the isolation of the people in return for salvage rights to any technology left behind from the war.

Spinward Salvage took ownership of the planet and moved the bulk of their resources to Nakege II. A small security force remained at the starport on Nakege to prevent any travellers from interfering with the indigenous population as agreed.

It has been over 100 years since the war and most of the salvage has been transported to Nakege II but Spinward Salvage still send out the occasional survey team to find more wrecks. Guards are still stationed at the starport but with little salvage left, it is unlikely that the corporation will continue to uphold their end of the arrangement for much longer when there is no profit to be made from it.

### ATTITUDES

The corporate security guards are usually quite unfriendly to anyone who lands at the starport. They will explain that Nakege is under the protection of [[Spinward Salvage]] LIC and that the facilities here are not for public use. Anyone needing starport facilities should go to [[Nakege II]].

The Nakege system has seven planets, two of which are gas giants. Nakege is the fifth planet from the sun.

Should anyone get past the security, the indigenous people will be even more hostile. If travellers do not respect the wishes of the people here, they will use force to rid themselves of any unwanted travellers.

### LAWS

Access to offworlders is denied as detailed above. Weapons, drugs and travellers are all banned on Nakege.

### PLACES OF INTEREST

There is nothing here for travellers since they are not allowed access past the starport.
