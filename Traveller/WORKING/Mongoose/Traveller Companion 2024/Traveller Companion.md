The Traveller Companion is a compilation of variant and alternate rules. Variant Traveller
creation systems allow specific tailoring, whilst alternate combat rules introduce hit
locations and wound severity. Rules for hunger, thirst, temperature, atmospheric and
water pressure effects make the universe more realistic, not to mention more hazardous.
Encounters with animals and vehicles are also covered, along with the consequences of
lawbreaking on personal and starship-operations scales.


The game universe is expanded with advice on using tools such as Travellermap
and the Traveller Wiki, interpreting UWP data to flesh out a world, and additional
spaceport types. The Companion also contains rules for starship operations in gas
giant atmospheres, travelling slower than light and in jump space, and making space
travel more hazardous with minefields, missile salvoes, and new starship weapons. Also
included are rules for entirely different styles of play such as narrative task resolution
and the mundane events resolution system.


The Traveller Companion is a complete toolkit allowing referees to pick and choose
enhancements to their own campaigns, giving greater depth and weight to their adventures.

# I NTRODUCTION

Welcome to the Traveller Companion!

This volume contains additional and alternative rules
for Traveller, allowing any campaign to be tailored
to different play styles and settings. The Traveller
Companion should be considered a toolkit, from which
the Referee can pick and choose whichever rules seem
most appropriate to the style of game being played.
Alternatives can be left for another time; perhaps a
one-off game which requires special rules or a new
campaign with a different feel to it.

The Traveller Core Rulebook is designed for a fairly
realistic ‘hard-ish science’ setting, in which the
Travellers are experienced and skilled people but
not larger-than-life heroes. The Traveller Companion
not only provides alternatives to concepts that are
closely tied to the Third Imperium Universe, it also
includes rules for more narrative styles of play or
more ‘heroic’ games, as well as variant settings such
as horror-based universes.


The Traveller Companion provides alternative methods
of generating Travellers, giving differing degrees of
control over the process, and additional combat rules
that add realism or streamline play. Additional careers
and pre-career options give new opportunities for
backstories and the creation of unusual Travellers.


All of the rules contained in this volume are, of course,
optional and it is up to the Referee to decide which
elements are suitable for the campaign being created.
Some elements fit easily with the typical Traveller
game setting but others – for example rules for
additional characteristics – will change the nature of
a Traveller setting and should be considered carefully
before inclusion in a game.


Consider the Traveller Companion as a ‘toolkit’ for
Traveller, and build your campaigns to your own
requirements, supported by the rules in this book.


# C HARACTERISTICS

The following rules are intended to expand upon or
replace those found in the Traveller Core Rulebook.
They are used at the Referee’s discretion – some,
all or none of these rules can be applied to a
campaign as appropriate.

HIGH AND LOW CHARACTERISTICS
Normally, the range of characteristics is 0–15 but
there are occasions where a being or creature may
have characteristics that are not on the ‘human scale’.
Such a being may have one or more characteristics
above 15, in which case the DMs on the Characteristic
Modifiers table are applied to checks made using them.


The following additional characteristics lend themselves
to resolving certain situations that might otherwise
be difficult to adjudicate. The Referee must decide
if they are desired in any given campaign and if so,
all Travellers should generate them. Alternatively,
they might be used only for non-player characters
encountered by the Travellers. Note that some of these
are not just additional characteristics; they are a set of
mechanics the Referee can use as necessary.


WEALTH (WLT)
If the Referee does not want to track every Credit and
cost of item, they can use the abstract Wealth (WLT)
characteristic. A Traveller’s WLT starts equal to their
SOC and is increased by one for every Cash Benefit
roll taken after a career, to a maximum of 15. Reduce
the Traveller’s WLT by -1 if they are injured during a
career, and by -3 if they use anagathics.


A Traveller’s WLT characteristic determines the lifestyle
they can maintain comfortably and how much petty
cash they have on hand. The Traveller has a number of
Credits to hand at any time in a given month equal to
the amount shown on the Wealth table.


Characteristic Modifiers
Characteristic DM
0 -
1–2 -
3–5 -
6–8 +
9–11 +
12–14 +
15–17 +
18–20 +
21–23 +
Every +3 thereafter +1 to DM

ADDITIONAL CHARACTERISTICS
Some styles of game might require one or more extra
characteristics. The Traveller Core Rulebook already
contains one example of this – Psionic Strength.
In many Traveller campaigns PSI is not used at all,
although it could be implemented if the Travellers
encountered some psionic threat.


Wealth Cash Obtainable
1 Cr
2 Cr
3 Cr
4 Cr
5 Cr
6 Cr
7 Cr
8 Cr
9 Cr
10 Cr
11 Cr
12 Cr
13 Cr
14 Cr
15 Cr


If the Traveller needs to spend more than this amount,
they may do so by making a WLT check, modified by
DM-1 per 5,000 Credits spent. If the check succeeds,
the Traveller can make the purchase. If the check is
failed, permanently reduce WLT by -1 and try again, or
not make the purchase and avoid the reduction.
At the end of each month, the Referee should adjust
a Traveller’s WLT characteristic up or down if their
financial circumstances have changed greatly. In
addition, it is suggested that amounts (both earned
and spent) measured in millions of Credits (MCr) are
tracked accurately. WLT should be used for personal
items and purchases alone.

LUCK (LCK)
Luck represents a Traveller’s general good and bad
fortunes, and governs situations that are essentially
beyond a Traveller’s control. It is useful in highly
cinematic games, allowing Travellers a get-out if
things go wrong, and can be used to give ‘plucky
but inexperienced young hero’ type Travellers
an advantage. This is not always desirable – the
majority of Traveller games are set in a cold, uncaring
universe ruled by the laws of science rather than
whimsy – but Referees running some types of game
will find LCK useful.

LCK is determined by a straight 2D roll and cannot be
permanently increased or decreased in the manner of a
Travellers’ other characteristics. Only major events can
change a Travellers’ LCK; this is at the discretion of the
Referee, who must decide what factors may influence
LCK. In some campaigns it may be desirable to allow
Travellers to collect charms or artefacts that improve
their fortunes, although this should not be overdone
(and they may not have the effect the Travellers
expect). Karma can also play a part; the Referee might
decide that good or bad deeds are worth a little good
fortune in the future. Luck can also be used as a plot
guide in some campaigns, with ‘correct’ actions leading
to improved LCK and bad deeds adversely affecting the
Travellers’ fortunes.

LCK can be used to determine success/failure or
see who is affected by a random event. A Traveller’s
chance of succeeding in a task through blind luck
should never be better than their chance when using
skills and good planning. However, when all else fails
and the Traveller must simply leap into the dark, LCK
can be used to determine whether he lands on his feet
or faceplants into a wall.


RANDOM SITUATIONS
LCK can be used to see what happens to which
Traveller when no other factors apply. For example, if
one Traveller selected at random is to be the victim of a
bad event, everyone can make an opposed LCK check
and the lowest score will be the victim.


Some events will instead affect every Traveller failing
a LCK check. This might occur when a random event
takes place, such as when a group of Travellers are
caught in the open during a meteor shower or they
open unmarked ration tins.


ALTERING CHANCES OF SUCCESS
If a Traveller really needs to succeed in a skill or
characteristic check, they may expend LCK on a
temporary basis. Each point of LCK spent translates
into DM+1 to the check. Likewise, each LCK point
expended can be used as a negative DM to a check
made against them; a Traveller can use LCK to
make an enemy miss an otherwise easy shot. All
LCK points expended in this way are regained at the
end of an adventure.


SURVIVING A DISASTER
A highly cinematic game might use LCK as a way of
keeping the Travellers alive through their adventures.
This is an optional use of an optional characteristic, and
the Referee is advised to consider this style of game
carefully; it is likely to be a lot less realistic than the
typical ‘ordinary joes in space’ style of Traveller game.


If this rule is in use, when a Traveller suffers some
catastrophic event the Referee may grant the
Traveller a chance to survive through blind luck by
a Very Difficult (12+) check, with no characteristic
DMs used. Instead, the chances of survival can be
increased by permanently expending points from the
Traveller’s LCK characteristic.


A DM equal to the number of LCK points expended
can be applied. This means a very significant number
of points must be ‘burned’ in order to give a good
chance of survival. Once these points are expended,
they are gone for good and the Traveller’s LCK score is
reduced, perhaps increasing the number of bad things
that happen to them later on.


If the LCK check is successful, the Traveller somehow
survives. Maybe their crampons caught the ice surface
and slowed their fall into the crevasse enough that
they are hurt and stuck at the bottom of a crevasse
rather than dead, or maybe they snag something on

the way down. Maybe the plasma gun misfired, or the
bullet somehow missed every vital organ. However it
happens, the Traveller’s LCK is permanently reduced
by the amount of points expended. If LCK reaches 0
then every random bad event that can possibly happen
will befall the Traveller and their life may not be worth
living. The Referee should feel free to torment the
unlucky individual as much as they please.


Note that LCK cannot be used to affect someone else
in this manner. If a Traveller fails their LCK check, their
friends cannot try to get lucky on their behalf.


If this option is used, it may be desirable to allow
Travellers to regain their LCK. This is not a matter of
spending money; instead the Traveller will have to
undertake good works, visit remote temples to ask the
gods why they survived and generally go out of their
way in an adventure-material-creating sort of way. Even
then regaining LCK should be a difficult business.


EXAMPLES OF USING LUCK
The Travellers are caught in a meteorite shower and
risk being struck. This is essentially a random event,
since the meteorites move so fast it is beyond the
means of the Travellers to avoid them. Normally a
straight 2D roll might be used to see if any given
Traveller is hit but if LCK is in use, this roll can be
modified by the Travellers’ LCK DM.


Not being hit by meteorites: Average (8+) LCK
Check (1 minute).


On another occasion, the Travellers disturb an angry
creature. It is in the middle of them and the choice of
who to bite is essentially random. All the Travellers
might be asked to make an opposed Average (8+) LCK
check, with the one with the lowest Effect getting bitten.


MORALE (MRL)
The Morale (MRL) characteristic represents a mix of
courage, motivation, determination and sense of ethics.
It functions in a similar manner to END, although in
a psychological manner rather than physical. MRL is
useful in games with a lot of combat but can also be
applied to many other situations. It provides a way to
adjudicate situations where the Traveller insists they
will do the most effective thing regardless of tedium,
discomfort and distractions... or hostile gunfire.


MRL is determined, like other characteristics, by rolling
2D. It is increased by +1 for every successful term the
Traveller has completed in a military service (e.g. army,
navy or marine) or every two successful terms they
completed in a disciplined but non-military service (e.g.
scout, merchant or agent).


MRL checks are used in combat or when trying to
overcome fear-inducing situations but can have other
applications. For example, if a Traveller insists that
they are going to spend 10 hours a day working on
a boring project, MRL can be used to determine if
they stick at it. MRL checks should not be used in
place of good roleplaying but can be a useful tool
for a Referee whose Travellers insist on undertaking
unrealistic actions.


MORALE CHECKS
A Morale check is called for when a significant obstacle
or setback is encountered. This may or may not be
combat related; realising that the Travellers will have
to traverse right around the mountain before even
beginning to climb might be disheartening enough to
make a group of climbers quit.


Typically, the Referee will call for a MRL check when a
group of combatants takes significant casualties (10-
20% of its numbers), or when they see allies fleeing.


A MRL check may also be called for when an
individual is wounded in combat or facing a
particularly fearsome foe.


A MRL check might also be required if a Traveller is
unexpectedly hurt or encounters unanticipated danger.
For example, if a Traveller is suddenly struck by an
unexpected blow, they may flinch rather than reacting
boldly. Similarly, when a sniper’s bullet narrowly misses
their head, a Traveller might dive for cover rather than
finishing what they are doing.


The MRL of a group can be averaged from the values
of everyone involved or, for large-scale military units,
assigned according to the experience and training of
the personnel involved. As a rule, group Morale will
affect the whole group – if everyone else runs away,
a high-Morale individual will normally find it prudent
to do likewise. He may decide to stay and fight alone,
however, in which case an individual MRL check (at
his own level, not that of the group) can be used at
the Referee’s discretion.

6

###### Characteristics


To remain resolute in the face of modest threat or a
daunting task: Routine (6+) MRL check

If the MRL check is failed, the Traveller or group will
become ‘shaken’ and seek cover and stay there, or
begin to retreat and continue to do so until rallied. If the
MRL check is made to stick at a daunting task, a failure
may indicate refusal or a ‘freeze’ where the Travellers
cannot make any progress until their determination is
restored or obstacles are removed.

A MRL check with an Effect of -6 or worse usually
results in inexplicable panic and rout. Conversely,
an Effect of 6+ indicates stern resolve or gung-ho
enthusiasm. If so, the Referee may decide to impose
extra beneficial results, such as a Boon on all future
MRL checks (until one is failed) or a positive DM to
melee combat attacks. Very good and very bad MRL
checks can both result in individuals going berserk.
This is not always a good thing.

A shaken group or Traveller will remain so until some
reason to regain confidence presents itself. That
might be a period without danger or could be due to
the actions of another Traveller deliberately trying to
rally the group. Once the Referee feels an opportunity
to pull themselves together has presented itself, the
group or Traveller can make a new MRL check to
regain their confidence.

If the situation is particularly bad, the MRL check
will be at a higher difficulty level, as shown on the
Morale Checks table. It may also be necessary to
undertake multiple MRL checks to accomplish a task
or win a battle. For example, if a group takes very
heavy casualties or is asked to do something that is
apparently suicidal, a MRL check may be necessary.
Note that MRL check failure may not be obvious; many
commanders have thought they had rallied their men
for an assault, only to have them stall within a few
paces of a half-hearted attack.

**USING MORALE**
Mike the Marine is leading a mob of local militia in a
battle against low-tech enemies. As a line of enemy
cavalry begins to advance against them, the militia start
to edge back. Hoping to forestall a retreat, Mike shouts
some inspiring words and steps to the front of the
line. The Referee decides this is a reasonable action
despite the bullets cracking past Mike’s ears; Mike is an
experienced mercenary and has shown considerable
personal courage in the past, so the Referee does not
ask for a Morale check on his part.


Morale Checks
Circumstance Base Difficulty
First injury received in a fight Routine (6+)
Character receives
significant injury


Average (8+)


Casualties taken Average (8+)
Serious casualties (30%) Difficult (10+)
Massive casualties (60%) Very Difficult (12+)
Unusual danger One level harder
Incredible danger Two levels harder
Excessive tedium One level harder
Unbelievable tedium Two levels harder
Good odds/big reward 1–2 levels easier
Trusted leader present 1 level easier
Inspiring leader present 2 levels easier


The militia nervously stay in position as the cavalry
approaches but their rifle fire is insufficient to break the
charge. As the lance points come down Mike shouts
to the militia that their best chance of survival is to
stay together. The Referee makes a MRL check for
the militiamen and it fails. Despite Mike’s advice, the
militia begin to flee. Mike stands his ground alone to
shame the militiamen into staying in their position. The
Referee thinks this is rather unwise and is quite willing
to send a whole regiment of lancers against Mike, with
predictably fatal results.


This seems like a good time for a MRL check at quite
a high difficulty level. With his allies fleeing and certain
death hurtling at him in the form of 700 lance points,
this is a tough MRL check and Mike fails it. Mike finds
himself in the middle of a rout, with enemy cavalry
chasing his men down and lancing the stragglers. Such
is the life of a mercenary soldier.


Meanwhile, ‘Two-Gun’ Cassandra is in a bad position.
Her handguns are out-ranged by the enemy’s rifles
and they are manoeuvring to put her in a crossfire.
The position of cover she occupies is about to
become untenable but the only way to reach safety
is a hazardous dash across open ground. Cassandra
resolves to chance it. With her is Damien, a friend with
little combat experience. Cassandra tells Damien what
she intends to do and why it is necessary. The Referee
secretly makes a MRL check for Damien and fails it.
White-faced, he agrees to make the run to safety.


7

###### Characteristics


TRAVELLER


Both set off on the dash but after two steps Damien
turns and runs back into cover. Cassandra now has to
decide whether to turn back or keep going, and how to
extricate her terrified friend from danger.


On another day, Arix the Accountant is being bullied
by a local thug and decides to stand up to him. This
goes badly: Arix is punched to the ground. Arix gets
up and has another go, and gets knocked down again.
Arix decides that he will never give in and will keep
on getting up no matter how many times he is beaten.
The Referee thinks this is not in keeping with Arix’s
persona as a penpushing interstellar accountant and
asks for a MRL check. Arix passes and clambers
defiantly to his feet. Whether or not he gets knocked
down again is another matter...


SANITY (STY)
Sanity is a useful characteristic to have in games
with a supernatural element or those that involve a
lot of cybernetics. Travellers experiencing a strange
electronic world might be driven mad by it, temporarily
or permanently. Sanity could also be used to model
the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder on
Travellers who had unpleasant experiences in service
or during an adventure.


Sanity is determined by a straight 2D roll. A Traveller
with a STY characteristic greater than zero is
essentially sane and responsible for their actions,
although they might be a little unstable or have
hang-ups that cause unusual behaviour. Sanity can
be temporarily or permanently reduced to zero, at
which point the Traveller may develop some serious
form of mental illness.


STY checks may be called for upon witnessing deeply
shocking events or things disturbing to the mind of
mortals. One such is jumpspace, which is said to cause
insanity if viewed for even a short time.


If a Traveller fails a STY check under most
circumstances, he takes damage to his STY
characteristic much like physical damage affects
STR, DEX and END. Most events will cause D
or 1D damage but some particularly horrific or
traumatic events will cause more harm. If STY
is not reduced to zero, it will return to its normal
value over time. If it does reach zero, more serious
consequences befall the Traveller.


Long-term exposure to traumatic situations will
also reduce sanity, although typically at a low rate.
Travellers engaged in trench warfare might be
required to make a STY check once per week, or
lose a point of STY.


In some cases, a STY check will be all-or-nothing. If
it is passed, the Traveller has dealt with the incident
and is not suffering any long-term harm. If the check
is failed, there will usually be a specific response. For
example, Travellers confronted with a particularly weird
creature might be required to make a STY check or flee
in terror. Some psionic talents may have similar effects.
If STY is reduced to zero on a temporary basis, the
Traveller loses the ability to act rationally. Temporary
insanity can take the form of panic or catatonia, or
perhaps utter confusion leading to an inability to act
coherently. It may also manifest as violence, possibly
against the wrong recipient. The form of temporary
insanity will usually be dictated by the nature of the
insanity-causing event.

8

###### Characteristics


Some events and situations can result in a permanent
loss of STY. If STY is reduced to zero on a permanent
basis, the Traveller has become seriously ill. Mental
illness is a sensitive issue and one which is badly
misunderstood by many people, so the use of long-
term mental disorders in a game is a theme that should
be approached with care.

Even relatively minor issues such as a modest level
of paranoia or obsessions about particular actions
or objects can make life very difficult for the sufferer,
but it is still possible (and quite possibly enlightening)
to play a Traveller battling such problems. More
serious mental illness will tend to be debilitating for
Travellers and requires specialist treatment. This
is a very difficult matter to incorporate into a game,
especially since games are intended to be fun. It is
recommended that an insane Traveller takes some
time, gets professional help ‘off-camera’ as it were,
and returns to play in a more stable state.

Temporarily lost STY points are regained at the rate of
one per day spent in safe and supportive conditions.
Getting enough sleep, not being cold and hungry, and
not getting shot at or chased by monsters all go a long
way towards regaining mental resilience.

**USING SANITY**
The Travellers have an alien passenger aboard their
ship, a species that has an automatic feeding reflex.
It simply cannot help itself when it grabs the ship’s pet
and swallows it whole, but the Travellers are disgusted,
outraged and horrified. The Referee calls for an
immediate STY check. Those who fail are compelled to
assault the alien out of reflex.

Meanwhile, Ilaina the Engineer has interfaced with
a computer the Travellers retrieved on a previous
mission. Using her wafer jack she begins navigating
the computer’s systems from the inside, only to be
confronted with chaotic and frightening images created
by its anti-intrusion software. Ilaina attempts to keep
a firm grip on reality and push through but must make
a STY check or lose 1D STY. If she can get past the
defences without being driven mad, she can gain
access to the computer’s systems but it will be a while
before the nightmares fade (i.e. until she has regained
her full STY value).


Later, the Travellers are confronted with a monstrous
creature so frightening they are stopped in their tracks.
Each Traveller must make a STY check or flee in terror.
Some pass their checks and bravely advance but Mike
the Marine fails. His big gun and combat skills are
unavailable as he cowers behind a nearby boulder,
unmanned by almost supernatural terror.


SOCIAL STANDING (SOC)
The SOC characteristic in the Traveller Core Rulebook
is tied to the concept of a noble hierarchy of some
kind, but this may not be present in all game settings.
Even if it is, there may be cultures which use a different
system or people who have equivalent standing without
possessing a noble title. The elected president of a
multiworld polity may not be a noble as such but she
certainly has equivalent social standing and power.


Even where there is a noble hierarchy in existence,
possession of a high SOC does not necessarily equate
to holding a title. Some high-SOC Travellers may
be distant relatives of a noble and thus part of the
upper classes without having any titles of their own.
SOC indicates what level of society the individual
is accustomed to operating at and therefore their
knowledge of etiquette and how to perform appropriate
ceremonies, rituals and the like. It also indicates
whether or not the Traveller has sufficient standing to
hold a given office such as a noble title.


In some societies, noble ranks may be replaced by
religious or mercantile titles, or based on rank in a
guild. SOC is also in many ways relative; the monarch
of a small country on a balkanised planet might hold
the local rank of king but this does not place him above
(or even anywhere near) the duke who oversees an
entire subsector. SOC thus indicates social standing on
the wider stage and provides an equivalency between
Travellers from very different backgrounds. It also
provides a useful guide to precedence at functions
where people from different societies meet.


SOC 0 is a special case. A Traveller with SOC 0 is an
outcast, fugitive or pariah. This is not a passive effect
like SOC 1–2; the Traveller will be reviled, persecuted
and possibly attacked. Returning to society is not as
simple as increasing SOC to 1; the Traveller will have
to redeem themselves, obtain forgiveness or somehow
gain permission to re-enter society.


9

###### Characteristics


TRAVELLER


SOC 1–2 represents very low status, typically those
on the very fringes of society such as street kids,
dwellers in shanty-towns or temporary camps. Very low
SOC does not indicate that the Traveller is a criminal
but it is likely they will come into contact with crime.
Travellers from this lowest echelon of society tend to be
streetwise and ‘close to the ground’.


SOC 3–5 implies a degree of poverty and lack of the
social graces favoured by higher echelons of society.
Low-SOC people may be deliberately downtrodden by
the higher-ups, or simply be part of the lowest class
in society such as peasants and unskilled workers.
Such people often take great care to maintain an air of
respectability even if they are desperately poor.


SOC 6–8 typically represents skilled workers, lower
professional classes and the like.


SOC 9–11 represents the upper end of the professional
bracket, equating to the ‘upper middle classes’ and
minor gentry who might have a measure of fame or
importance. Members of a noble’s household typically
have SOC in this range. Their knowledge of etiquette
and importance-by-association can be sufficient
to allow them to move in noble circles, such as
attending the court of a high noble without making an
embarrassing gaffe.


SOC 11 is the lowest value necessary to hold a noble
title. On the interplanetary scale, SOC 11 equates
to a knighthood but leaders of a country would
have equivalent status, as would an entertainer or
personality whose fame spans several worlds. The
senior management of a modestly sized interplanetary
corporation would typically have SOC 11 or so, whether
or not they hold a noble title.

10

###### Characteristics


SOC 12 equates to a Baron on the interplanetary scale,
or non-noble leaders of a minor single-planet polity.
Very famous non-noble personalities would also hold
an equivalent SOC. The senior management of a large
interplanetary corporation would typically have SOC 12
or so, whether or not they hold a noble title.

SOC 13 equates to a Marquis on the interplanetary
scale, or non-noble leaders of a fairly important
planetary government. Interstellar superstars and the
uppermost echelons of a very important corporate body
would also have SOC 13 or so.

SOC 14 equates to a Count on the interplanetary
scale, or non-noble leaders of a small multi-
world government. The most senior members of a
Megacorporation would also have SOC 14 or so,
although in most societies with a noble hierarchy they
are likely to have noble titles.

SOC 15 equates to a Duke on the interplanetary scale,
or non-noble leaders of a subsector-wide polity.

**EFFECTIVE SOC**
SOC represents a Traveller’s ‘official’ standing but
can be modified on a temporary basis. A Traveller’s
Effective SOC determines how people react to them.
It can occasionally be higher than their normal SOC
value but more commonly Effective SOC represents a
lowered standing. For example, a noble who has been
the victim of a smear campaign or who has suffered
some public disgrace might have a lowered Effective
SOC until he regains favour, redeems himself or funds
enough propaganda to improve his status.

Effective SOC can be altered due to some mischance
or the whimsy of court politics. For example, if a
Traveller is a war hero and the mood at the local
Duke’s court is strongly anti-war, then he may have a
lowered Effective Soc until the political wind changes.
Other reasons for lowered Effective SOC include
leadership of a failed enterprise, failure to live up
to expectations (however unreasonable they may
be) or the actions of a ‘black sheep’ relative. Such
individuals are often granted a stipend to go away and
not attract attention – which is a good rationale for an
adventuring noble Traveller.


Effective SOC can also be altered by the favour or
disfavour of influential people. If a Traveller is currently
the favourite of a powerful noble, their Effective SOC
may be raised since others will want to benefit from
association. Similarly, if a previously respected noble
falls out of favour with the local ruler (perhaps rightly,
perhaps as a result of some plot to turn the monarch
against him) then their Effective SOC may be reduced.


A Traveller’s SOC modifier is based on his permanent
SOC value when questions of etiquette and knowledge
arise, but upon Effective SOC when determining how
people react to them.


To be awarded a noble title or similar honour, a
Traveller’s Effective SOC must be high enough to hold
it. Their permanent SOC value may not be, which can
cause complications later. If a Traveller’s Effective
SOC falls below the level required for their titles or
offices, they may find themselves snubbed or their
orders simply ignored.


Travellers are unlikely to be stripped of titles or
offices just because they are out of favour at court.
However, there is always a risk, especially if someone
has suffered a serious reduction in Effective SOC.
A Traveller whose permanent SOC is too low for the
titles they hold will retain their posts and titles but is
a controversial figure, which can lead to the loss of
additional Effective SOC.


A Traveller whose Effective SOC is three or more points
too low for a given title risks having the title stripped
from them or at the very least suspended. It is possible
to make a case for this not to happen, which usually
requires an audience at court and promises that at least
sound workable. Some impoverished nobility may hold
very impressive titles which have become meaningless.
This is represented by a permanent SOC close to the
level required for the title and a lower Effective SOC.


Effective SOC can be rebuilt to its old value by actions
seen as virtuous or which attract favour. An alternative
and quite common method is to spend a lot of money
and sleaze your way back into the good graces of
those you offended. Permanently lost SOC must be
regained by conspicuously heroic, virtuous or similarly
respectable actions, or by obtaining a pardon or
forgiveness for the offence.

###### Characteristics


TRAVELLER


Effective SOC can be reduced by failing to maintain
the living standards expected of someone at that social
level. Costs are given on page 92 of the Traveller Core
Rulebook. Any Traveller failing to meet the standards
required for their SOC for three months in any four
must reduce his Effective SOC value to the lowest
level they maintained in that period unless there is
some good reason for the reduced standard of living. A
Traveller held prisoner and fed bread and water does
not suffer a status reduction for the indignity, although
they may be censured for allowing themselves to be
captured in the first place.


If a Traveller’s Effective SOC is lower than their SOC
for three consecutive months, their SOC is reduced
by -1 unless they can make a Difficult (10+) Admin,
Carousing, Deception or Diplomat check to convince
people that everything is alright or there is some
explanation other than relative poverty.


To increase SOC to a value of 10 or less, all that
is necessary is to maintain an Effective SOC at
least one point higher than the target score for six
consecutive months. Only one point of permanent
SOC can be gained at a time.


Increasing SOC to 11 or above requires the
maintenance of an Effective SOC at least one point
higher than the target value for a whole year. Effective
SOC can be increased by several points if an important
high-society individual endorses the Traveller, but the
costs of maintaining suitable living standards must be
met. The award of noble titles will normally follow in-
game actions or events during a career and cannot be
simply bought by maintaining a luxurious lifestyle. If a
low-SOC Traveller is granted a title his Effective SOC
immediately jumps to a level suitable to hold it but if
this is not maintained it will fall again and the title may
become meaningless or be taken away.


EXAMPLE
Arix the Accountant is a low-end professional with
SOC 8. His heroic deeds in the audit department of
the Sector Duke have resulted in a knighthood, which
requires a SOC of 11. Arix’s Effective SOC jumps
immediately to 11 but his permanent SOC value is still

8. If he can maintain the lifestyle associated with his
Effective SOC for six months his permanent SOC rises
to 9, and after another six months to 10. If he could
continue in this vein for another year he would reach
SOC 11 but sadly his money runs out. This is quite an


embarrassment for an interstellar accountant and, more
importantly, he cannot maintain the lifestyle associated
with SOC 10. His Effective SOC drops to 9 for a few
months and Arix risks a reduction in his permanent
SOC. He can do some creative accounting to prevent
this and accounting is what he is good at. However,
he is becoming aware that others at court consider
him nothing more than a jumped-up commoner who
has failed to drag himself up to the standards required
of his new status. Arix’s knighthood is meaningless to
some of the ‘old nobility’ at court and he begins to find
court life quite uncomfortable.


ALTERNATIVE CHARACTERISTICS
To a great extent, SOC is tied to a single society. If
a Traveller ventures far from this society’s sphere of
influence, it loses much of its meaning. The same
applies to Travellers from distant cultures. This can
be solved by the application of common sense; for
example, someone from a distant state in the Vargr
Extents might be very important, with an equivalent
SOC 12 and used to dealing with people at a high
level, but their SOC value does not indicate noble rank
in the Third Imperium.


In some cases, SOC is less important than a
Traveller’s innate ability to charm and influence
people. In this case, SOC can be replaced by a
Charm (CHA) characteristic that applies almost
anywhere the Traveller goes. At the Referee’s
discretion, SOC can be retained as well, indicating
status in the Traveller’s home society.


Some characteristics are foreign to humans or other
creatures, or are entirely alien. If a being would not
have a characteristic it can be given a value of zero.
For example, an immobile intellect such as a sentient
computer would have 0 values for STR and DEX, and
probably END too. A non-sentient creature would be
assigned a value of 0 for EDU.


In cases where an alternative characteristic is desirable,
perhaps due to a very different natural environment,
a creature can be assigned one with a similar name
to indicate its prowess in such an environment. For
example, a creature that evolved in an aquatic or
extremely low gravity environment might be assigned
a characteristic named Grace rather than Dexterity. A
Traveller from a more conventional environment uses
half his relevant characteristic as its equivalent.

###### Characteristics


# A

## LTERNATE

## TRAVELLER CREATION

The career system in the Traveller Core Rulebook is
a lot of fun but also takes time and does not always
produce the right sort of Traveller for a campaign.
The variations in this chapter allows a Traveller to be
created quickly and tailored to a desired play style.

OPTIONAL TRAVELLER

CREATION RULES

These rules replace one or more parts of the Traveller
creation system, leaving the rest unchanged. Any,
all or none of these alternatives may be used at the
Referee’s discretion.

**IRON MAN**
In Classic Traveller, if you failed a survival roll, your
Traveller was killed. The Iron Man rules repeat that
challenge – instead of rolling on the Mishap table if
you fail a survival roll, your Traveller is killed and you
must start again. Under the Iron Man rules, you must
balance the advantages garnered from spending
another term in a career with the risk of dying in action.
Other than these changes, Iron Man works just like
normal Traveller creation.

**SOLO GENERATION**
Creating a Traveller on your own works just like normal,
with the following minor changes:

The Connections Rule: Instead of making connections
to other Travellers, the Referee should provide a list
of characters, organisations or places in his campaign
suitable for connections. For example, you might get
a bonus skill if you had a connection with the Imperial
Intelligence service, or were on the run from the law
and willing to take passage on the first ship to hire you.

Skill Packages: Instead of picking a skill package, gain
any one skill at Level 1.


SKILL SELECTION
In this variant, skills are picked from the Skills and
Training tables instead of rolling randomly for them. In
all other ways, it is identical to standard generation.


ALTERNATE CHARACTERISTIC DETERMINATION
Alternative methods of determining characteristics can
be used, tailoring Travellers to the desired style of play.


Boon Dice Method: The Referee may apply a Boon
on any two characteristics of the Traveller’s choice,
rolling 3D for those two characteristics and discarding
the lowest dice. This practically guarantees a Traveller
to have at least decent scores in the areas they desire.
For truly heroic Travellers, Boon dice can be rolled on
four characteristics, or even all of them.


Assignment Method: Roll 12D and write down the
value of each dice. These can then be assigned as
whole dice to the Traveller’s characteristics as desired,
allowing the Traveller to obtain high values where
they are most desirable. For a heroic Traveller, delete
any two dice scores and replace them with 5s. These
values are assigned as the Traveller desires.


MAXIMUM TERMS
A Traveller sticking to well-paying and safe careers
can avoid ageing almost indefinitely. The Referee may
wish to impose a limit on the number of terms taken
during Traveller creation. A limit of three terms will
produce Travellers competent in one or two fields but
still have a lot to learn. A limit of six or seven terms
will give experienced and skilled Travellers who can
take on dangerous missions. Past eight or nine terms,
it becomes increasingly likely that the Travellers
will be too rich and influential to bother with minor
assignments. (‘I’m a duke, and my friend here was an
admiral! Why are we wandering the galaxy instead of
sitting in our palaces?’)


TRAVELLER


BWAPS
Bwaps can be found throughout the
Imperium and are also known as Wabs or (a
more derogatory term) Newts, due to their
appearance. Body markings vary tremendously
between clans and families, with each having
a distinctive skin pattern. This pattern is
determined by genetic factors and colours
are determined by careful manipulation of the
mother’s diet during the formation of the egg.
Greens, browns, yellows and blues are most
common, in contrasting shades.


Bwaps are uncomfortable in less than 98%
humidity, as their skin must be kept moist,
although with special clothing, they can exist
indefinitely in areas of low humidity, provided
they have adequate water. Their clothing
normally consists of a loosely fitting garment
and hood, permeated with a network of fine
tubes through which water flows and keeps the
cloth moist. In occupations where they must
handle items which would suffer from moisture,
Bwaps wear thin water-proof gloves. Humans
often consider Bwaps obsessed with minutiae
and order in their environment. Driven by the
desire to put everything in its proper place, they
make excellent bureaucrats, mathematicians,
scientists and historians.


CHARACTERISTICS
Bwap Travellers have the following modifiers
applied to their characteristics: STR-4, END-


TRAITS
Bwap Travellers all possess the following traits:


Structured Mind: Bwaps have a very logical
way of thinking and make for excellent
administrators. All Bwaps receive a permanent
Boon on all Admin and Science checks.
However, if a Bwap ever tests for psionic
potential (see Traveller Core Rulebook page
196), it does so with a Bane.

alternate character creation


PACKAGE-BASED CREATION
These rules replace the standard Traveller career rules
in their entirety. Instead of rolling on the career tables,
the Traveller chooses a set of packages which contain
the skills he wishes to obtain.

Traveller creation is carried out in the following stages:

- Create and assign characteristics
- Choose a background package
- Choose a career package
- Finalise the Traveller

Any of these stages can be used instead of the
normal process of Traveller creation, at the Referee’s
discretion. For example, a Traveller might be
assigned characteristics using this system, then pick
a background option (also from this system) before
following the normal career-based Traveller creation.

Note that under this system skill levels all stack, up to
the usual maximum level of four. So, a Traveller might
gain Carouse 2 from his career to add to Carouse 1
from his background, giving Carouse 3.

**CREATING CHARACTERISTICS**
Characteristics are determined by any of the methods
available, as chosen by the Referee.

**BACKGROUND PACKAGES**
Background packages are designed to speed up
Traveller creation by providing a set of skills and other
benefits associated with the Traveller’s homeworld
and upbringing, reflecting the skills a young person
would acquire growing up in such an environment.
In some cases the package includes adjustments to
characteristics. These cannot reduce a characteristic
below 1 or increase it above 15.

A background package replaces the Traveller’s
normal background skills and their first term,
representing a person who has reached adulthood
and completed an apprenticeship, training, education
and/or their first few years in employment. The
Traveller is now aged 22 and can begin a normal
career, or instead take a career package.


If a background package is taken, the Traveller
receives no other skills or advantages for his
homeworld, upbringing and education. A Traveller
may only select one background package but can
choose the most applicable. Note that background
skills for any given package are set and replace the
usual 3+EDU modifier for Travellers created using the
Traveller Core Rulebook.


Once a background package has been assigned, the
Traveller is assumed to be 22 years old and ready to
enter a career or start the campaign. It includes all
benefits the Traveller has earned up to age 22 (the end
of their first term) and replaces all life events and other
sources of additional skills.

The Belter package is
available to Travellers who
spent their early years in a
belter community or similar
environment, such as a remote
outpost on a gas giant moon
or an undeveloped rockball
planet. It assumes a lifestyle
where the young Traveller
would have to be familiar with vacc suit operations;
someone who grew up in a more civilised environment
such as an orbital highport or aboard generation
starship should use the Space Habitat package instead.

The Colonist package is
available to Travellers who
hail from frontier worlds and
underdeveloped regions
of more settled ones. The
Traveller’s homeworld must be
at least marginally habitable

- those from rockball worlds
should use the Belter package
instead. Colonists generally have to be tough and
resourceful, and able to handle the challenges their
harsh environment throws at them without relying too
much on technological assistance.

They may not necessarily be
criminals but will have lived
in a world where crime (and
violence) is common.

The Developed World
package is available to
Travellers who grew up in a
relatively civilised environment
such as a city on a mid- or
high-tech world. Skills are
skewed more toward making
a living than surviving in a
hostile environment, with a
variety of educational options available.

The Low-Tech package is
available to any Traveller
who grew up in a TL3 or
lower society. This could be
a frontier or backwater area
of a more developed world
if the Traveller belonged to
a minority group. Low-Tech
citizens are not necessarily
barbarians, although many offworlders might call them
that. Note that hailing from a Low-Tech background
does not necessarily translate to total ignorance of
technological items and Travellers may have seen and
know how to operate equipment not readily available
in their society. Low-Tech Travellers are unlikely to
receive an education into the complex mysteries of the
universe but are in general tougher and more resilient
than those raised in a ‘softer’ environment.

The Metropolis package is

grew up in a high population

a high-population world or very
crowded city. People from such
an environment tend to be
tailored to it and generally better
educated but less physically fit
than those from less crowded environments.

The Space Habitat package
is available to Travellers who
grew up in a ‘city in space’ or
aboard a starship. Denizens
of orbital cities or those whose
family worked at a highport
should use this package;
those who had a more rough-

use the Belter package instead.

The Water World package is
available to Travellers who
grew up on very wet worlds
(Hydrographics code 9 or 10),
in contact with the natural
environment of the world.
Those who dwelt in a city that
happened to be underwater
but were little affected by the
maritime environment, should use the Developed
World or Metropolis package.


CAREER PACKAGES
A career package replaces the Traveller’s normal path
through career generation and provides a set of fixed
benefits. A career package replaces all Benefit rolls,
life events and all other sources of extra skills, with one
exception – a group of Travellers may still select skills
from an appropriate skills package before play begins.


A career package is equivalent to a full career in the
chosen area and only one can be taken. Roll 3D for how
many years the Traveller has aged during his career;
this need not correspond to a normal term length.

A wanderer is essentially a
spacegoing bum, moving from
one world to another. The
wanderer may be searching
for something or trying to
leave something behind.
Wanderers tend to pick up
useful shipboard skills from
working passage aboard
starships or professional skills from their odd jobs.


FINALISING THE TRAVELLER
The background and career packages can be used
to create a quick template for a Traveller. However,
there will usually be a skill that is desirable but lies
outside the realm of what otherwise looks like an
attractive package. To tailor the Traveller to the
desired style of play, one option is permitted from
each of the three categories below.

**CAREER**

1. Increase any skill offered at level 1 or above in the
    Traveller’s career package to level 4
2. Increase any 3 skills listed in the Traveller’s
    career package at any level by one each, to a
    maximum of 2
3. Leave the service at Rank 4 without gaining
    extra skills


TRAVELLER SKILLS
Choose any of the skill pairs listed below, both at level 1.

1. Vacc Suit and Steward
2. Gunner (any) and Mechanic
3. Pilot and Electronics (any)
4. Gun Combat (any) and Recon
5. Melee (any) and Streetwise
6. Broker and Admin
7. Carouse and Deception
8. Engineer (any) and Electronics (any)
9. Science (any) and Investigate
10. Drive (any) and Profession (any)
11. Survival and Navigation
12. Medic and Admin

1. 1 Ship Share
2. Cr100000 in cash
3. Combat implant
4. 1 Ally and 2 Contacts
5. TAS Membership
6. SOC+1


POINT-BUY CREATION
This option enables a Traveller to enter play with
exactly the desired skills and characteristics, using a
point-buy system. The default option is career-based
point-buy; under this system the skills available to a
Traveller are dictated by the career being followed
and should be determined on a term-by-term basis.
However, there is also a ‘free point-buy’ system under
which Travellers can choose whatever skills and
benefits they please – subject as usual to Referee
approval. This system is also useful for quickly creating
non-player characters.


The Referee may decide what types of Traveller are
permissible, or may exclude certain alien races from this
system for reasons of play balance or to avoid creating
Travellers that will not fit into the setting. An unusual
choice accompanied by a good backstory and rationale
might be permissible at the Referee’s discretion.

22

alternate character creation


**STARTING POINTS**
The amount of points available depends on how ‘heroic’
the Referee wants the Travellers to be and can be
varied. For example, 250 points will create a typical
Traveller with a reasonable set of starting skills.

Step 1: Starting Characteristics
The Traveller begins with all characteristics set at a
value of 0.

**Step 2: Racial Modifiers**
If there are racial modifiers to characteristics, they
are applied before any characteristic points are
bought. This may result in a negative value which
must be offset by spending points. Any skills gained
as a result of the Traveller’s species choice are noted
and gained at no cost.

Step 3: Buy Characteristics
The Traveller’s characteristics may be modified up or
down using points. No characteristic can be reduced
below 1 or above the normal maximum for the
Traveller’s species.

Step 4: Select Background Skills
The Traveller gains the usual number of background
skills as per the Traveller Core Rulebook. These skills
are taken from the Background Skills list on page 8 of
the Traveller Core Rulebook and gained at level 0.

Step 5: Select Skills
The Traveller may purchase any permissible skills
using points. If the career-based option is in use, the
Traveller must declare what career they are pursuing
and can only select skills from that career’s tables. If
the Traveller wants skills from more than one career,
he must select all those desired in the first career then
declare a switch to another career (accompanied by a
plausible rationale) at a cost of 5 points. The Traveller
can switch careers repeatedly at an additional cost
of 5 points per switch. So, a Traveller who wanted
skills from three careers would have to switch twice,
at a cost of 5 points for the first and 10 for the second
career change. If the free point-buy method is used, the
Traveller may select any skills.

**Step 6: Select Additional Benefits and Drawbacks**
The Traveller may now select additional benefits,
starting equipment, cash and other final details. In
some cases this may result in a gain of points which
can be spent on additional skill levels.


CHARACTERISTIC COSTS
Characteristics are bought one level at a time, at a cost
determined by the current value of the characteristic.
Reducing a characteristic by one level gains the
Traveller the points back.


COST TO BUY CHARACTERISTICS
The Cost to Buy table indicates the cost to buy a
characteristic value outright rather than calculating
each increase. This assumes that no racial modifiers
have been applied and the characteristic started at 0.
As a point of reference, a human Traveller must expend
84 points to buy six characteristics at a value of 7.

SKILL LEVEL COSTS
Each skill must be bought one level at a time,
including level 0. With the exception of Jack-of-All-
Trades, all skills cost the same to learn and develop,
the cost of obtaining a skill based on its new level.
The Jack-of-All- Trades skill costs five times the value
listed on the Skill Level Costs table.


The usual limit of level 4 applies to all skills unless the
Referee chooses to remove it. The Skill Level Costs
table includes skill increase costs beyond level 4 for the
sake of completeness.


As a guideline, taking one skill at level 3, two at level
2 and three at level 1 plus six skills at level 0 costs a
Traveller 111 points. The Traveller would also have
some free level 0 skills as a result of his background.


RANK AND OTHER BENEFITS
Rank and other benefits are bought with points like
anything else the Traveller wants to have. All items
in the Rank and Benefits table are bought outright
rather than by level.


Negative values indicate a points gain for taking a Rival
or Enemy. No more than three Rivals or Enemies can
be taken by the Traveller.


Benefit Item permits the Traveller to choose any of the
standard benefit items for their career (or any career
if the free point-buy method is being used). Examples
include: gun, blade, weapon, TAS Membership,
Armour, Combat Implant and so forth. Items must be
physical – a Traveller cannot take ‘gun’ more than once
and receive skill levels instead, and cannot take any
benefit that alters a characteristic. Ship shares are not
available under this system.


Each point allocated to Equipment Allowance
gives the Traveller Cr2000 to spend on starting
equipment. The Referee should adjudicate what
is available – grav tanks, battle dress and a fleet
of combat robots are not really appropriate as
starting equipment. The allowance must be spent
on equipment and cannot be converted to cash but
need not all be spent before play starts. A Traveller
who has not spent his whole allowance can be
assumed to have some gear stashed away or on
back order from the manufacturer.


Each point allocated to Starting Cash gives the
Traveller Cr1000 in cash.


VERY QUICK POINT-BUY
A Traveller with straight 7s for all characteristics costs
84 points. Giving this Traveller one skill at level 3, two
at level 2, three at level 1 and six at level 0 costs 111
points for a total of 195 points. If very quick point-buy
is desired, take this as a starting point and allocate the
remaining points (55 remaining out of 250 for a typical
Traveller) as desired.

## LLIES, CONTACTS,

## RIVALS AND ENEMIES

The Traveller Core Rulebook includes rules for Allies,
Contacts, Rivals and Enemies. This chapter deals
with these people in more detail. It allows a Traveller
to have Allies who hate them or an Enemy that would
do anything for just a kind word from them, creating
additional opportunities for roleplaying and storytelling.

Whenever a Traveller acquires an Ally, Contact,
Rival or Enemy, the following system can be used
to determine their nature and characteristics. The
process is as follows:

1. Determine the degree of Affinity or Enmity towards
    the Traveller
2. Determine the degree of Power or Influence
3. Determine any special characteristics

DEGREE OF AFFINITY OR ENMITY
Not all Enemies are hell-bent on the destruction of
the Traveller. Some are hostile in a passive manner
and will simply refuse to help rather than going out
of their way to set death-traps. At the other end of
the scale is the implacable Enemy who will pursue
the Traveller to the grave and might even find a way
to arrange posthumous revenge. Some Rivals are
actually friendly to the Traveller but have an agenda
that will cause them to put their own requirements
before those of a friend.

Likewise, some Contacts are pretty neutral or even
a little hostile but will still prove useful if a deal is
beneficial to them. Some Allies are willing to fight to the
death for a Traveller others merely well-disposed but
not willing to put themselves out.


Every Ally, Contact, Rival or Enemy has a degree of
Affinity and a degree of Enmity. Often one of these
values is zero, placing them firmly on one side of the
line or the other. However, some relationships are more
complex than this, making these people unpredictable.
Interactions with them have the potential to be tragic, or
may be the key to undoing the plots of their masters if
they can be won over.


AFFINITY
Affinity represents how favourably inclined the person is
towards the Traveller. It is rated from zero to six.


ENMITY
Enmity is the opposite of Affinity. It indicates how much
trouble the person will go to in order to harm or impede
the Traveller. It is rated from zero to negative six.


AFFINITY AND ENMITY AS INDICATORS
The sum of Affinity and Enmity values is a useful
indicator of an individual’s actions toward the Traveller.
For example, a former friend who feels bitterly betrayed
but sometimes remembers the good times might have
an Affinity value of 3 and an Enmity value of -4, giving
a net -1. On average, this person will not actively
seek to harm the Traveller. However, depending on
circumstances he might act in an unexpectedly positive
manner – although in a bitter and ‘don’t you dare thank
me’ sort of way. On another day he might screw over
his former friend out of spite and later regret it.


Affinity/Enmity
Result Value
2 0
3–4 1/-1
5–6 2/-2
7–8 3/-3
9–10 4/-4
11 5/-5


Relationships

Ally 2D 0
Contact 1D+1 1D-1
Rival 1D-1 1D+1
Enemy 0 2D


TRAVELLER


DETERMINING AFFINITY AND ENMITY
Very high levels of Affinity and Enmity are extremely
uncommon. Even Enemies and Allies are usually
fairly moderate in their outlook and will not allow their
relations with the Traveller to dominate their lives.
There are, however, exceptions. The base score
for Affinity and Enmity is determined by rolling the
appropriate dice on the Relationships table and then
comparing them to the Affinity/Enmity table.


Note that this occasionally creates Contacts who are
more negatively than positively disposed towards
the Traveller and Rivals who actually rather like the
Traveller and are disposed to help them when possible.
This can create an interesting situation with many
possibilities for roleplaying.


For example, Ivah has a Rival and an Enemy as a
result of her time in the Scout Service. Her Rival rolls
1D-1 for Affinity, getting a result of 5. This indicates an
Affinity of 2. Her score on 1D+1 for Enmity is a 2, which
indicates an Enmity value of 0.


Ivah’s Rival actually likes her and has no hostility
towards her. Ivah declares the two were friends
whose similar career paths caused one to lose out


in favour of the other on various occasions. Each
has occasionally had to put their own interests first,
which has strained their relationship. However, Ivah’s
Rival is generally inclined to help her if it is not much
trouble and if it does not impede his own progress.
Ivah decides that her Rival is now the leader of a
team of Scouts and that Ivah believes she should
have held that post. The next time they meet things
might get complicated, especially if they start taking
risks to try to outdo one another in a way that starts
out friendly but escalates...


The Enemy is rather more clear-cut. His Affinity roll is
automatically a zero, indicating no friendly intentions
whatsoever towards Ivah. The roll for Enmity comes
up an 8, giving a base value of -3. This might change
as other characteristics are generated but for the
time being his outlook towards Ivah is very negative.
Ivah decides this is another fellow Scout who was
dropped from the team at Ivah’s recommendation
and is intent on revenge. Although his enmity is not
serious enough to contemplate murder or waste his
life pursuing, this enemy feels that Ivah deserves
anything bad that befalls her. For her part, Ivah
wonders if losing leadership of the Scout team to her
Rival was something to do with this Enemy, further
complicating her relationships.

Allies, contacts, rivals and enemIes



Enmity Degree of Enmity Notes
0 None No Enmity towards the Traveller. This may be because they do not know who the
Traveller is, or because the Traveller has done nothing to offend them.
-1 Mistrustful Vaguely ill-disposed towards the Traveller (or perhaps everyone in general) but
will not go out of their way to impede them. Someone with an Enmity value of -1
is unlikely to take an action that will have serious consequences for the Traveller
unless there is some great benefit.
-2 Negatively
inclined


May engage in acts of petty spite for no gain, just to annoy and upset the Traveller.
Someone with an Enmity value of -2 will probably stop short of actions that would
seriously harm or kill the Traveller.
-3 Very negatively
inclined


Will go to some trouble to impede the Traveller, just out of spite. Does not care
much what happens to the Traveller and will more than likely feel they deserve
anything they get.
-4 Hatred Will do almost anything to get one over on the Traveller. Might actively plot against
the Traveller for the sake of revenge or causing further harm even if there is little or
no gain involved.
-5 Bitter hatred* Will actively plot or take serious risks to cause the Traveller harm at
any opportunity.
-6 Blinded by hate** May engage in self-destructive actions in order to harm the Traveller or put
innocents at risk.


Affinity Degree of Affinity Notes
0 None No Affinity towards the Traveller. This may be an enemy or just someone who does
not care at all what happens to the Traveller, depending on Enmity.
1 Vaguely well
inclined


About as well inclined towards the Traveller as any random stranger with a social
conscience is likely to be. They will take minor actions to help, largely out of
common courtesy, but not go to much trouble on the Traveller’s behalf unless there
are benefits to the action.
2 Positively inclined Will probably help in a safe and easy manner if asked, even without reward, but will
not take much risk.
3 Very positively
inclined


Will take modest risks on the Traveller’s behalf or offer help without being asked, if
they realise their friend could benefit.
4 Loyal friend Will do almost anything to help the Traveller but may have higher loyalties to their
own family, cause or service, or to other close friends.
5 Love* Will probably put the Traveller’s interests before their own or that of others.
6 Fanatical** Will do whatever the Traveller asks of them (or what they think the Traveller would
want), no matter what risks are involved. May also expect others to do the same.

* Love might be romantic or in the manner of a close family member, comrade through some traumatic event, or the like. Someone
who owes a debt of honour to the Traveller, even if they do not like the Traveller all that much, might also have an affinity value of 5.

** This level of affinity is rare and may not be healthy for either party. A deluded stalker might have an affinity value of 6 but
other considerations make them dangerous.

* Bitter hatred can also represent an obligation to destroy the Traveller. The reasons might be personal or on behalf of
someone else. Alternatively, the enmity might be due to the Traveller’s opposition to a cause. It might even be altruistic after
a fashion – someone who genuinely believes the Traveller is a bad guy who must be stopped may be just as determined to
destroy them as someone who hates the Traveller on a personal level.

** Someone with this much hated may be willing to harm others to get to the Traveller and may extend their enmity to his
friends and comrades.

DETERMINING POWER


AND INFLUENCE
Some associates and enemies are more valuable than
others and not always in a tangible way. The two key
factors are Power and Influence.


Power represents the level of force, money or other
assets can be directly brought to bear. This does not
mean the individual can always send in the troops

- an army officer might command a powerful force
but it is unlikely he will be able to divert it halfway
across the sector to help out an old friend without an
overwhelmingly good reason. However, very powerful
individuals can often use a small part of their overall
powerbase without compromising their position.


Influence is less obvious than Power but in many
ways more versatile. When action is taken using
gunmen, cases of cash, or the direct intervention
of a top-end legal team, it is usually very apparent
what has happened. On the other hand, an influential
individual might discreetly put an idea in the mind of
a powerful legislator, or remind a sector duke that
his nephew owes his life to the Travellers without
actually asking for anything. Influence can sometimes
result in power being used from a different direction;
subtly and without trace.


For any given person, Power and Influence are
determined by rolling on the Power/Influence table.
Some individuals may have a lot of one and very little
of the other, most have a little of both. Note that this
method indicates the level of power this individual can
actually wield rather than everything their position has
available. The owner of a vast business empire might
not actually be able to bring much leverage to bear
on a problem due to constraints of accountability and
barriers built into the structure of his business.


A person with Power and Influence values of zero is still
capable of bringing their own personal talents to bear.
Conversely, just because someone has a given level of
Power or Influence does not always mean they can use
it or choose to do so.

DETERMINING SPECIAL


CHARACTERISTICS
The general nature of the association may be indicated
by the career event that created it but there is often a
more complex story waiting to be told. At the Referee’s
discretion, a given Contact, Ally, Rival or Enemy can
be further fleshed out. The Referee should decide
how many of the Traveller’s associations are to be
expanded in this way or roll 2D for each one; on a
score of 8+ there are special characteristics.


Determine the nature of these characteristics on the
table below by rolling D66 (as defined on page 5 of the
Traveller Core Rulebook). These characteristics can
modify values already generated, or create a complex
relationship where someone is an Enemy but well
disposed towards the Traveller. A situation like this
might arise where an individual is required by honour
to avenge an incident but has come to like and respect
the Traveller despite the enmity between them. The
converse might apply when causes and agendas align
but the people involved hate one another.


Affinity and Enmity have a maximum value of 6. If
either reaches 6, it cannot be further modified and
the Traveller has a fanatical friend or enemy no
matter what else happens.

32 This individual belongs to an uncommon alien species.

33 This individual is particularly unusual, such as an artificial intelligence or very alien being.

Powerful groups will want a lot in return for their support; minor ones will expect less but may not be able
to offer much support.

35 This individual is a member of an organisation which holds a generally opposite view of the Traveller.
Thus an Ally is a member of an organisation which opposes the Traveller’s agenda.

judged by association.

41 The Traveller and this individual had a very bad falling out. Reroll Enmity on 2D and use the new result if
higher than the original.

42 The Traveller and this individual had a reconciliation or other very positive change in their relationship.
Reroll Affinity on 2D and apply the new result if it is higher than the original.

43 This individual fell on hard times. Reduce Power by -1.

44 This individual was ruined by misfortune caused by the Traveller. Reduce Power to 0 and increase
Enmity by +1.

45 This individual gained influence with the Traveller’s assistance. Increase Influence by 1 level and Affinity
by 1 level.

Power by +1 and create a new Enemy for both the Traveller and this individual.

51 This individual is missing under suspicious circumstances.

52 This individual is out of contact doing something interesting but not suspicious. Their reappearance may
bring about an unexpected opportunity.

53 This individual is in desperate trouble and could use the Traveller’s help.

55 This individual is in prison or otherwise trapped somewhere.

56 This individual is found or reported dead. This may or may not be the whole story...

61 This individual has recently married or has experienced some other life-changing event that creates
new responsibilities.

62 This individual has been disowned by family, has become divorced, or otherwise has suffered a
negatively life-changing event.

63 This individual’s relationships have begun to affect the Traveller. Create a new Contact if this individual’s
Affinity is higher than Enmity or a Rival if Enmity is higher than Affinity.

# P RE-CAREER OPTIONS

**COLONIAL UPBRINGING**

Those who grow up in the outback of a developed
world or on a new colony do not always have the
option to follow a normal career path. A youngster with
dreams of joining the navy or becoming an interstellar
entertainer may instead find themselves stuck on the
farm for another couple of years, and even then it may
not be easy to get into a prestigious service.

A colonial upbringing provides slightly more than the
usual set of skills, as learning starts early. On the
downside, education tends to be lacking and transition
into a career can be difficult. A Traveller who had a
colonial upbringing may find it a little easier to get
into certain careers as their specialist skills may be
in demand, but suffers DM-2 on all attempts to get
into any career not listed for a recruitment bonus.
In addition, a Traveller from a colonial background
suffers DM-1 on all checks to achieve commission or
promotion throughout his entire career.

Travellers from a colonial background receive DM+1 to
qualify for the Rogue or Scout careers.

The following pre-career options are available in
addition to University and Military Academy, which are
described in the Traveller Core Rulebook.


Entry: Automatic if homeworld is TL8-


Skills: Animals 0, Athletics 0, Drive 0, Gun Combat
0, Mechanic 0, Medic 0, Navigation 0, Recon 0,
Profession 0, Seafarer 0, Survival 1.


Graduation: INT 8+. DM+1 if END 8+. If 12+ is rolled,
graduate with honours.


Graduation Benefits:

- Increase one skill already gained at level 0 to
    level 1.
- Gain any two other skills listed above at level 1 or
    increase one skill already possessed by one level.
- Gain Jack-of-all-Trades at level 1.
- ‘Honours’ graduates gain Leadership 1 and may
    increase any other skill gained at level 0 to level 1.
- Increase END by +1, and decrease EDU by -D3.


The Traveller is aged 22+2D3 years when entering their
first career.


Some Travellers are lucky enough to be born into a
community where psionics are used and will receive
testing and training as a matter of course. Such
communities tend to be either physically or socially
isolated from the wider universe, which can often leave
a Traveller without necessary skills when venturing out
to begin a career. It is unlikely that a psionic community
will be among the upper echelons of society. Many
will live simple lives without the distractions of high
technology; others blend in among ordinary citizens
and are too focused on their psionic studies to achieve
great things in the world of business or the military.

On the other hand, growing up among psions means
a Traveller will automatically be tested for potential
and talents, and will receive at least some training.
Graduates of a psionic community will have completed
whatever training the combinate can offer, whilst
honours graduates are among their most promising
young members. A community might not be keen to see
such an individual leave.


Entry: PSI 8+, DM+1 if INT 8+


Skills: Profession 0, Science 0, Streetwise 0


Additional: The young psionicist is tested and receives
skill level 0 in each talent gained.


Graduation: PSI 6+, DM+1 if INT 8+. If 12+ is rolled,
graduate with honours.


Graduation Benefits:

- Increase PSI by +1.
- Skill level 1 in any one talent possessed.
- Science (psionicology) 1.
- ‘Honours’ graduates gain all acquired talents at
    level 1 and may advance one to level 2.
- Enlistment in the Psion career is automatic, even if
    the Traveller serves in other careers in between.
- Gain a Rival who is unhappy they left the community.
    Honours graduates gain an Enemy instead.

Those intending to embark upon a career aboard
merchant starships or as a portside broker can enrol on
a suitable training programme. Some courses are run
like a university degree, whilst others are much more
vocational. Some large merchant lines have training
ships or cadet berths aboard their larger vessels, where
a prospective employee can learn on the job. The end
result is much the same, with graduates being prepared
for a fast-track career in interstellar commerce.

Not all graduates find employment with a major
shipping line or port operator. Some are snapped up by
smaller lines; others decide to take a different path and
embark upon another career. Many businesses value
mercantile graduates despite them not being in the
shipping sector, making the Merchant Academy a good
starting point for a career in management or diplomacy.

Upon entry to the academy, a Traveller must choose
whether to follow the Business or Shipboard curriculum.

Entry: INT 9+, DM +1 if SOC 8+

Skills: If the Business curriculum is chosen, gain all

addition, gain one skill rolled randomly on the Service
Skills table at level 1.


Graduation: INT 7+, DM+1 if EDU 8+, DM+1 if

Graduation Benefits:

- Increase one skill already gained from the Broker
    or Merchant Marine table to level 1.
- Increase EDU by +1.
- The Traveller may enter the Merchant or Citizen
    career automatically at rank 1, providing this is the
    first career they enter after the academy and they
    enter the appropriate branch (Merchant Marine or
    Broker as per their academy path).
- An honours graduate may enter the above careers
    at rank 2, gaining the automatic skill for that rank.
- Graduates gain DM+1 on all advancement checks
    in the Merchant or Citizen careers. Honours
    graduates gain DM+2 on these checks.

Some Travellers grow up on the fringes of society and
are denied the usual opportunities to enter a career or
enlist in a service. Not all of these people are criminals
but many come into contact with crime one way or
another. Those that get out of that world fall into two
categories: some leave it as far behind as possible and
others take it with them wherever they go.


Streetwise recruits from slums and alleys of big cities
are sometimes desirable for their special knowledge
and skills but are rarely promoted and often mistrusted;
a graduate of the school of hard knocks can expect to
spend a career on the bottom rungs. Some are proud
to serve and glad to make a better life. Others are less
satisfied and become a problem for their employers.
Either way, careers tend to be short.


Entry: Automatic if SOC 6-


Skills: Streetwise 1, plus any two of: Athletics 0,
Deception 0, Drive 0, Gambler 0, Melee 0, Persuade
0, Stealth 0.


Graduation: INT 7+. DM+1 if END 9+. If 11+ is rolled,
graduate with honours.


Graduation Benefits:

- Gain any three other skills listed above at level 0.
- Gain Gun Combat 0.
- ‘Honours’ graduates gain Carouse 1 and may
    increase any other skill gained at level 0 to level 1.
- Decrease SOC by -1.
- DM-2 on checks to gain promotion or
    commission in first career. If the Traveller leaves
    this career by choice, checks in subsequent
    careers are as normal.


Most who grow up on an orbital habitat or asteroid
belt community live a life much like anyone else in a
high-tech city. For these people, their homes might
as well be planetside, other than the slim chance of
a life-support failure or similar disaster. However, not
all space habitats are like this. Some are collections
of small settlements in a planetoid field, with shuttles
plying between them. For the inhabitants of such a
community, formal education is likely to take second
place to rule-of-thumb instruction in how to survive
and get a day’s work done in a spacer environment.


Some Travellers leave the community and seek a normal
career elsewhere but many hang around for a few
years, picking up skills that might make them invaluable
to a small merchant ship or similar employer where
competence is more important than documentation.


‘Graduates’ of a spacer community have had instruction
from skilled people, whilst ‘honours graduates’ come
out with additional skills which may have been gained
at the cost of harrowing experiences.


Entry: Automatic if homeworld size Code 0. Int 4+,
DM+1 if DEX 8+


Skills: Vacc Suit 1, plus any two of the following:
Astrogation 0, Electronics 0, Engineer 0, Profession 0.


Graduation: INT 8+, DM+1 if DEX 6+. If 12+ is rolled,
graduate with honours.


Graduation Benefits:

- Gain any two other skills listed above at level 0.
- Gain any skill listed above at level 1.
- Gain Pilot 0.
- ‘Honours’ graduates gain Jack-of-all-Trades 1.

# A DDITIONAL CAREERS

TRUTHER
A truther is someone who seeks (or knows, or claims
to know) the truth about some fringe subject. In the
Third Imperium the most universal truthers are those
who seek knowledge of the Ancients or who say they
know secrets about them. There are many other kinds
of truther, however, from fringe scientists working on
far-out psionic phenomena to paranormal investigators
or conspiracy theorists.

Truthers are defined by the Truth they seek or the
knowledge they have. Their actual background and
occupation may be quite mundane, or they may
support themselves by various means (anything
from odd jobs to crime or embezzlement) whilst
they undertake their investigations or spread the
Truth. Some truthers may gain the patronage of an
organisation or group of followers whilst others are a
lonely voice in the wilderness.

Truthers do not have a conventional rank system
but instead have an additional characteristic, called
Following (FOL). This starts at 0 and can be increased
by events during their career or later in play. FOL
indicates how many people believe the truther’s
message, although this in no way influences whether or
not any of it is the actual truth.

The Interaction DM shown on the Following table is
used whenever the truther deals with media, crowds
or officials. It is applied as a positive DM to Persuade
checks when delivering The Message to the masses
or meeting fellow truthers, and as a negative DM
when dealing with straight-laced officials. Thus the
Interaction DM would be used positively to persuade
fellow believers to follow the truther into a restricted
area to protest endangerment of a local creature’s
habitat, and as a negative DM to the reaction of
officials when he turns up at the gates of a facility
demanding entry or access to records. In short, the
more credible the truther is with his fellow believers,
the less authorities like him.


BELIEVER
A believer may be part of a formal religious order
or a much looser one based upon personal belief.
They may also be part of a belief system that is not a
religion, such as a self-improvement scheme or fitness
programme. It may be that a Believer might not actually
believe the tenets of his professed faith but advocates
them to others for his own gain.


Most members of a religious movement or similar
belief system lead sedentary lives, either as religious
professionals or lay persons with a mundane job
and strong beliefs. Some belief systems are rather
violent, however, whilst others are active on the
humanitarian front and send delegations to disaster
zones. It is quite possible for a religious career
to lead to the captaincy of a mercy-starship or
leadership of a band of holy warriors.


The Traveller’s knowledge about his religion or
belief system and its tenets is represented by a
Science skill. This can be tailored to the Traveller’s
religion – Science (unified interstellar mythology) or
Science (church of the overmind), for example. The
Profession (religion) skill demonstrates the ability
to carry out ceremonies without forgetting parts or
dropping the holy relics but conveys only a basic
knowledge of the religion’s secrets.


Most benefits of a believer career are spiritual.
However, a sufficiently prominent or worthy person
might qualify for the equivalent of sainthood.
For non-religious belief systems this represents
legendary status as an icon of the belief system, who
others want to emulate.


This benefit can be gained more than once. Anyone
considered to be a sainthood candidate gains DM+2 on
all interactions with members of the same belief system
or anyone else who respects it. In addition, each
time candidacy is indicated, the Traveller may make
a Formidable (14+) Science (belief) check, subject
to DM+1 for every instance of sainthood candidacy;
success results in the Traveller becoming a living saint.
A Traveller considered to be a living saint gains DM+4
on all interactions with anyone who is part of their own
belief system or who respects it.

# T RAINING AND EXPERIENCE

It is possible for a Traveller to improve his skills or
characteristics by being taught, by diligent practise, or
as the result of experience gained in the field. All three
methods are abstracted by the use of Experience Points.

Experience Points may be awarded by the Referee at
the end of an adventure or for ongoing study undertaken
by a Traveller. Experience takes two possible forms:
Dedicated Experience and General Experience.

Dedicated Experience points are allocated to a
specific endeavour and cannot be assigned anywhere
else. General Experience can be allocated as the
Traveller sees fit, subject to Referee approval and
common sense. A Traveller who has just finished
an adventure that involved a lot of academic and
technical skills, plus a certain amount of running
around and getting healthy exercise, could justify
putting a General Experience Point into a physical
characteristic or technical skill (even one he did not
personally use but saw others using). Claiming that
the experiences he had on the adventure helped him
learn to speak Hiver or become a better astrogator
would be silly and should be rejected by the Referee.

Experience Points are gained using the
following guidelines.

ADVENTURE EXPERIENCE
At the end of an adventure or group of encounters,
an award of 1 General Experience Point would be
reasonable, with a bonus point for good roleplaying
or a particularly dynamic Traveller. The Referee
may choose to allocate no points to a Traveller who
did little or failed to become properly involved in
the game. For a very long adventure, experience
may be given at suitable plot breaks for segments
equivalent to a standard adventure.

These points must be allocated immediately to a skill
or characteristic the Traveller is trying to develop. They
cannot be held in a ‘pool’ for allocation all at once.


TRAINING
Travellers who are into self-improvement or learning a
new job can gain experience through training or study.
The typical Traveller who reads the odd journal, tries
out a few things from time-to-time and occasionally has
a burst of dedication and puts in some actual work,
will gain 1 Dedicated Experience point per six months
of game time. However much a Traveller may protest
that he studies avidly in every available minute, few
can keep up full-time study alongside their day job
of crewing a starship, defending the free galaxy or
whatever it is they do for a living.


If the Morale characteristic is in use (see page 5), it
can be used to adjudicate situations where a Traveller
wants to spend an unrealistically large amount of
time training or studying. If the Luck characteristic is
in use (page 4), taking time off and unwinding can be
rewarded with regaining expended LCK points, creating
a tradeoff between intense personal development and
living a fulfilling and rewarding life.


A Traveller who is in full-time training, perhaps taking
time to study at a planetary university or college, gains
one Dedicated Experience point per four months of
study, or 3 points per year.


In the case where one Traveller is teaching another
a skill they know, the student may make an Average
(8+) INT check with a negative DM equal to the skill
level being learned every four months. Thus, a roll
to learn a skill at level 0 is made without penalty; at
level 2 the penalty is DM-2, and so forth. If the roll is
successful, the trainee gains 1 Dedicated Experience
point. It is entirely possible to learn nothing; some
people are just not good students.


It is only possible to teach another Traveller to a
level one below your own skill level. So a Traveller
with Vacc Suit 1 can train someone up to level 0, a
Traveller with Vacc Suit 3 can train someone up to
Vacc Suit 2 and so on.


TRAVELLER


GAINING SKILLS
To gain a skill at level 0 costs 1 Experience point.
Gaining level 1 from level 0 costs 1 more, and after
that the cost is doubled, as shown on theGaining
Skills table. Each skill level must be bought in turn,
including skill 0.

INCREASING CHARACTERISTICS
Physical and mental characteristics may also be
increased by appropriate activity. Gym work, sport and
general exertion are good for physical characteristics
(STR, END and DEX) while study and problem-solving
can be used to train the mind (INT and EDU). SOC
cannot be trained; a Traveller who wants to improve
his SOC will have to do it in-game and spend a lot of
Credits in the process.


To increase a physical characteristic, the cost in
Experience points is equal to the new level, as shown
on the Gaining Characteristics table. For mental
characteristics, the cost is double the new level.

## ROAD SKILLS

## AND SPECIALITIES

The specialities listed in the Traveller Core Rulebook
are not the only ones possible. The following
expanded specialties can be used at the Referee’s
discretion. In addition, these rules also introduce the
concept of a sub-speciality.

BROAD SKILLS
In the Traveller Core Rulebook, a Traveller who
possesses a skill which has specialities associated
with it is treated as having a skill level of 0 in all
specialities. In most cases this is a reasonable
assumption – a starship engineer who specialises in
jump drives will no doubt understand at least the basic
principles of power plant operation.

However, some skills are very broad in scope; notably
Art, Profession and Science. If these rules are used,
Travellers who possess a skill in one speciality are not
treated as having skill level 0 in all others – the ability
to paint a landscape does not permit a Traveller to play
the piano and an understanding of linguistics does not
translate to a grounding in cosmology or knowledge
of xenology. Nor does the ability to write Traveller
adventures translate to creating useful maps for them!

These three skills therefore use specialities and
sub-specialities. A Traveller who has any skill level
(including 0) in a sub-speciality is treated as having
skill level 0 in all sub-specialties of that group but has
no skill in other sub-specialities. The specialities below
expand the Art, Profession and Science skills and add
additional specialities (and sub-specialities) to those
already listed in the Traveller Core Rulebook. When a
Traveller gains a skill level in one of these broad skills,
he must assign it to a sub-speciality.

The format for a sub-specialism skill is: Skill
(specialism/sub-specialism), for example: Science
(life sciences/biology).

**ART**
The Art skill is divided into the following specialties:

Performing: The ability to produce an entertaining or
convincing performance by use of voice, expression,
body movement and so forth.


Creative: The ability to create works of art by sculpting,
painting and digital media.


Presentation: The ability to convey information or
emotion through writing, holographic images or an
impassioned speech.


The Art skill has the following sub-specialities, most of
which are described in the Traveller Core Rulebook:


Performing Creative Presentation
Performer Visual Media Holography
Instrument Exotic Media Writing


Creative Arts/Exotic Media covers strange and possibly
alien art forms using very unusual techniques and
materials such as psionic manipulation of particles or
high-technology alteration of matter.


PROFESSION
The Profession skill is perhaps the broadest of all.
The rules below expand and subdivide Profession
into several areas of related expertise. Those listed
as specialities in the Traveller Core Rulebook are
not repeated here.


Their descriptions remain the same but they are
now sub-specialities.


Some Profession specialities deal with general
fields of endeavour, such as working in hostile
environments, whilst others are geared towards
making a living at a general Tech Level. Possession of
a speciality in an area of the Profession skill indicates
a general familiarity with procedures, terminology
and the working environment but does not substitute
specific skills. For example a Traveller with Profession
(crewmember) can find and use emergency equipment
aboard a starship but is no more skilled at operating a
vacc suit than anyone else without that skill. Likewise,
he can operate and clean galley equipment but needs
the Steward skill to make proper use of it.


TRAVELLER


When Profession is gained during a career, the
speciality and sub-speciality chosen must be
relevant to the Traveller’s background or career.
Sport, worker and colonist would be available to
almost anyone, but specialisms like crewmember are
only available to someone who would realistically
have a chance to learn these skills.


The Profession skill is divided into the following
specialties:


Colonist: This covers daily life on frontier and low-tech
(TL3 or less) worlds. The Traveller will be competent in
basic tasks required to establish a colony and live day-
to-day, such as building basic structures like houses
and barns out of available materials.


Crewmember: This covers daily life aboard a starship.
The Traveller will know where to find tools and
emergency equipment, and how to operate standard
systems. He will also possess basic shipboard skills
such as how to correctly peg down a shipping container
or clean a fuel filter without damaging it.


Freeloader: This covers ways of obtaining items
without buying or making them. This does not always
indicate illegal activity but freeloading is often a
morally grey area.


Hostile Environment: The hostile environment
speciality covers operating in dangerous environments
such as high and low gravity, underwater and in areas
where special protection is needed such as biohazard
and radiation threat zones. The Vacc Suit skill is
still needed to work in a suit but a Traveller’s hostile
environment speciality can be used when carrying out
tasks that are made more difficult by the environment,
and to avoid hazards.


Spacer: This covers the basics of living and working
aboard spacecraft or space stations. Someone with
the spacer speciality will be familiar with spacer slang


and procedures, and will not make embarrassing
‘noob mistakes’ or be scared by normal phenomena
such as jumpspace entry. This speciality can be used
when making a check to resist the effects of a bad
jump entry or exit.


Sport: This covers professional and recreational
sports and similar activities, although it specifically
excludes combat sports. Tackling someone on the
playing field is part of a game; doing something
similar in a bar brawl requires the Melee skill.
Similarly, where there is crossover with another skill,
only the lower of the two can be applied. For example,
a character with the motorsport sub-speciality at
level 2 knows a great deal about competitive driving
and setting up a car but performance on the track is
limited by his Drive (wheel) skill.


Worker: This is a catch-all for work-related
professional skills suited to a mid or high-tech
environment. It includes most of the specialities listed
in the Traveller Core Rulebook.


The Profession skill is then subdivided into the following
specialities and sub-specialities:


Colonist/Ranching: Looking after herds or flocks.
This speciality has some overlap with the Animals
skill but deals more with tasks like rounding up cattle,
slaughtering animals and ensuring herds are safe
from bad weather.


Freeloader/Scrounging: Covers a multitude of sins,
mostly concerned with covertly obtaining something
and getting away with it. This includes some legal
activities, like searching a junkyard for spares.
Freeloader/ Scrounging can be used to abstract a

###### Broad skills and specialities


Freeloader/Security: Permits a Traveller to set up
or defeat mechanical and electronic locks, and other
means of passive security, and also to spot alarms,
traps or other passive measures intended to keep
people away from valuables.

Hostile Environment/Contaminant: Used to avoid
hazards originating from biological, chemical or nuclear
contamination. It grants the ability to spot potential
hazards and decontaminate safely but will not help if
the Traveller is exposed to radiation or agents without
protection. An insidious or tainted atmosphere counts
as ‘contamination’ in this sense.

Making a chemical spill safe: Average (8+) Profession
(hostile environment/contaminant) check (3Dx5
minutes, EDU)

Hostile Environment/High-G: Represents experience
at operating in environments of 1.2G and upwards
and is mainly used to avoid hazards or offset penalties
imposed by the environment.

Staying conscious through an 8G turn aboard a combat
jet: Difficult (10+) Profession (hostile environment/
high-G) check (1D seconds, END)

**Hostile Environment/Low-G:** Represents experience
at operating in environments of less than 0.2G and
is mainly used to avoid hazards or offset penalties
imposed by the environment. In addition, a Traveller
may attack with a weapon that does 1D of damage for
every level of his low-G skill without risking becoming
disorientated. So, a Traveller with Profession (hostile
environment/low-G) 2 can use a weapon that does
up to 2D damage (plus or minus points are ignored)
without any risk of disorientation.

**Hostile Environment/Underwater:** Represents
experience at operating in aquatic environments,
or when submerged in other fluids. It enables the
Traveller to avoid or make use of currents, avoid
stirring up silt and carry out tasks made difficult by
underwater conditions.


Searching a river bed for valuables dropped in the
water without stirring up the muddy bottom Average
(8+) Profession (hostile environment/underwater)
check (2D minutes, DEX).


Spacer/Belter: The Belter sub-speciality covers life as
an asteroid miner. The Traveller will be familiar with the
slang and standard procedures used by both corporate
miners and those who live as belters. A belter will be
familiar with the art and science of finding valuable
deposits of ore, minerals, hydrocarbons or other
resources that can be extracted for use or to sell at a
profit. They will also have at least some familiarity with
the other aspects of prospecting, such as claims law,
strike registry and so forth.


Spacer/Crewmember: This indicates a Traveller’s
familiarity with the general tasks needed aboard a
starship. Many deck crew aboard large ships do not
have specific skills but simply add their labour to tasks
such as maintenance, cleaning, cargo loading and
shepherding passengers.


Sport/Various: Represents skill at a particular activity
such as ball sports or the exotic sport of atmosphere
surfing – using a personal re-entry shield to drop from
orbit. As a rule, skilled sportspersons tend to be able to
pick up at least the basics of other activities. However,
the Referee may rule that a given sport is beyond a
Traveller’s experience.


Worker/Metalworking: Traditional blacksmithing and
the use of powered tools in a technological workshop.


Worker/Armourer: Skill at maintaining armour and
weapons, and making slight alterations to equipment.


SCIENCE
There are five (very) broad areas within the general
field of science. Each is considered to be a speciality of
the Science skill and any skill levels in a sub-speciality
normally grants level 0 in all others belonging to that
speciality. The Referee may rule that this is not the
case for very obscure fields or areas of knowledge that
a Traveller has had no chance to encounter.


The specialities within the Science skill are:


Life Sciences: The study of living things and
life processes.

###### Broad skills and specialities


TRAVELLER


Physical Sciences: The study of energy, forces
and matter.


Robotic Sciences: The study of organic and inorganic
robotic systems.


Social Sciences: The study of interactions between
people and groups.


Space Sciences: The study of astronomical
phenomena and the interactions of bodies in space.


The Science skill is then subdivided into the following
specialities and sub-specialities. Descriptions of those
listed as specialities in the Traveller Core Rulebook are
not repeated here.


Physical Science/Jumpspace Physics: The
jumpspace physics sub-speciality deals with jump
drives and associated phenomena, including
theoretical research into other forms of faster-than-
light travel and jumpspace phenomena not associated
with interstellar travel.


MELEE
The Melee skill has numerous specialisms. The
unarmed speciality represents all-round close-quarters
fighting ability. This might be a formally trained fighting
system such as Ju-Jitsu or mixed martial arts, or could
be a familiarity with nasty grab-and-punch brawls.
Other unarmed combat specialities are available,
representing advanced capabilities in some areas but
leaving weaknesses in others.


Grapple: This represents the ability to fight at extreme
close quarters using wrestling, throwing, choking and
joint-locking techniques. This may come from a formal
system such as catch wrestling or Judo, or might simply
be a combination of experience and nastiness.


Life Sciences Physical Sciences Robotic Sciences Social Sciences Spaces Sciences
Biology Chemistry Cybernetics Archaeology Astronomy
Genetics Physics Robotics Economics Cosmology
Psionicology Jumpspace Physics History Planetology
Xenology Linguistics
Philosophy
Psychology
Sophontology


Grapple also covers some actions that are not pure
wrestling. A ‘grapple’ between two combatants may
involve them bashing one another against walls or
delivering knees, elbows headbutts and biting, and
possibly even an attempt to push a handgun into
the other’s ribs and pull the trigger. The common
denominator in all this is that it is happening in
a chaotic extreme-close-quarters grabbing and
wrestling situation.


A Traveller with the Grapple speciality gains no
benefit from it other than when in a grappling
situation. If a grapple has begun, the skilled grappler
may inflict one point of extra damage per skill level
any time he hurts his opponent. He also treats his
effective Melee skill as twice his grapple speciality
level when wrestling with an opponent.


Striking: This represents skill at delivering blows with
the limbs. This might come from a formal system such
as boxing or Karate, or could be nothing more than the
ability to throw big swinging punches. A striker treats
his Melee skill as 0 in a grapple unless he also has
a speciality such as unarmed or grappling. However,
he is more effective in an exchange of blows. A striker
may add one point of damage per level of his striking
speciality on any occasion he does damage with
natural weapons, other than in a grapple.


Fencing: This represents skill with a narrow range
of relatively light blade weapons including the rapier,
smallsword and their sporting equivalents. A fencer
treats his Melee skill as 0 when using other weapons
unless he has another speciality that covers their use,
such as the more general Melee (blade). When fighting
with a rapier or similar light bladed weapon, he treats
his effective Melee skill as twice his fencing speciality.

# A LTERNATE PLAY STYLES

NARRATIVE TASK RESOLUTION
Role-playing games have their origins in wargaming
which, by definition, tends to be very mechanics-heavy
and simulationist. However, over the years other styles
of gaming have evolved which rely less on mechanics
and more on a shared narrative between Referee
and players. At the Referee’s discretion, a narrative
component can be added into a Traveller campaign.

If this option is used, each Traveller is entitled to a
number of Narrative Events per game session, tied
to their skills and characteristics. Each Traveller may
declare one Narrative Event for every positive point
of their Characteristic modifiers and one for every skill
level they have. These are tied to the characteristic
or skill they derive from, and must fit the skill or
characteristic being used.

So, a Traveller with a DEX modifier of +2 and an
INT modifier of +1 has three characteristic-based
Narrative Events available. Two must somehow be
connected with speed, agility or manual dexterity,
and one with intellect or problem-solving. If the same
Traveller also has Pilot (spacecraft) 2 and Persuade
1, he may perform two Piloting-related Narrative
Events and one connected with his ability to convince
others of something.

A Narrative Event essentially replaces a skill or
characteristic check and under normal conditions
would be used to narrate something positive,
although there is nothing to stop a Traveller narrating
some minor disaster where they failed to accomplish
their goals if circumstances warrant it. More
commonly, the Traveller may use a Narrative Event
to automatically complete a task.

A Narrative Event cannot make the impossible
achievable; what the Traveller narrates must be
plausible. For example, if the Travellers are trying to
move a collapsed wall, it is not plausible for one of
them to scoop all the rubble out with a teaspoon, or
blow it up with explosives the Travellers do not have. A
Narrative Event must also be interesting. If the Traveller
were to describe how they improvise a lever and locate


a large piece of rubble to move aside, creating a hole
big enough to get through, this would seem acceptable.
Just stating that the rubble got moved is not really
narrative and should not be allowed by the Referee.


A Narrative Event essentially replaces any skill or
characteristic check the Traveller might make and
cannot be used if the check was impossible. It can
be assumed that the Traveller succeeds solidly but
outstanding results (equivalent to Effect 6+) are not
possible. What a Narrative Event can do is to create a
favourable circumstance, such as allowing a Traveller
to shoot an enemy before they throws a grenade, no
matter what the initiative order might be.


A Narrative Event cannot be used against another
Traveller but can be used to rescue them from
disaster. For example, when Arix the Accountant
slips and falls from a mountain ledge, ‘Two-Guns’
Cassandra can narrate how she dives to the edge
and grabs him before he falls to his death. The
Referee may also rule that certain non-player
characters are immune to Narrative Events or might
even use them. Some situations (e.g. the climax of an
adventure) can also be off-limits to Narrative Events
at the Referee’s discretion. This ensures that the
Travellers arrive at the final scene in a condition to
deal with the final threat but does not give them an
easy ride in the climactic battle or challenge.


A Narrative Event can be used to cause harm to an
NPC; for example a Traveller might narrate how they
clobber a gunman with a chair, rather than risking a skill
check that might be failed. However, damage must still
be rolled, so the final outcome is in some doubt.


The use of Narrative Events creates a more cinematic
style of Traveller game, in which the Travellers can
automatically succeed or avoid disasters caused by
bad dice rolls. This allows them a greater chance of
getting to the big climax scene and allows a lot more
creative input, but it is not suitable for all groups. Some
will try to exploit the narrative style of play to gain a
competitive advantage, whereas the whole concept
of narrative play is that it is cooperative between the


TRAVELLER


Referee and Travellers. With the right group, narrative
play creates a whole new dimension to Traveller
games but if it is abused the Referee is advised to
return to the normal rules.


THE MUNDANE EVENTS CHECK
Sometimes it is necessary or interesting to determine
how well a Traveller completes a task that is not
covered by any particular skill area, or as an indicator
of how well or badly a Traveller does during a glossed-
over period of inactivity. A Mundane Events check may
be requested by the Referee. This is a simple 2D roll
against an Average (8+) difficulty.


At the Referee’s discretion, a Mundane Events check
can be modified by a relevant skill if appropriate.
If a Traveller is working as a starport broker, it is
reasonable to expect that their Broker skill will affect
how well they are doing in daily life.


Very good or bad (Effect 6+ or -6) results indicate that
things went unusually well or badly but the Referee
should not impose extreme results on a Traveller that
are essentially unearned. For example, Arix visits his
old friend Saalif, requiring a journey of several weeks
by commercial starship. The trip is not particularly
relevant to the storyline so the Referee asks for a
Mundane Events check to indicate the general nature
of events. It comes up a double-1, giving an Effect of -6
against the benchmark Average difficulty. This indicates
something has gone awry.


While it would not be unreasonable (if upsetting and
ironic) for a Traveller to die as a result of a disastrous
dice roll in combat, it is not desirable for Arix to be
killed by a freak drive explosion or pirate attack on
what was a random roll. Instead the Referee decides
that the trip was a nightmare, with extra fees, delays,
bad food, being stuck in a backwater starport for
three weeks and so forth.


Meanwhile, the Referee decides to see how Saalif
has been doing since Arix saw him last. Saalif rolls a
straight 12 for his Mundane Events. This is the best
possible result but it does not mean he has won the
planetary lottery and been made king or anything
so extreme. Unearned prizes are equally unfair to
Travellers. The Referee decides that Saalif has been
promoted at work, moved into a nice new house and
won a few hundred Credits in a competition he did not
remember entering. He is also in good health and has
lost a few pounds; he is doing well and looking great.


Arix and Saalif then head off on an adventure. Any
rewards and hazards they encounter will be earned
as captains of their own fate and so extremes are
entirely acceptable.


RECOGNITION OF COMPETENCE
There are many situations where a Traveller who
is competent in the appropriate area of expertise
would know basic facts, recognise circumstances or
be able to perform standard tasks. At the Referee’s
discretion, Travellers should be given information or
allowed to perform actions without needing to roll
dice. This is based on their level of competence,
indicated by their skill level.


Skill Level 1 represents a basic professional level of
competence. The Traveller should be able to perform
routine tasks, maintain equipment and remember
information relevant to their field of competence.


Skill Level 2–3 represents an experienced professional
who will be able to undertake quite complex tasks and
will know a great deal about their subject.


Skill Level 4+ represents highly advanced
knowledge, training and experience. The Traveller
will be able to connect apparently unrelated facts
or spot small discrepancies that a less experienced
individual might miss.


For example, if the Travellers are trying to figure out
how a shooting occurred, they would normally use
the Investigation skill. However, a Traveller with Gun
Combat 1 or better would know that some of the bullets
they have dug out of a wall are of a calibre used in
revolvers which, coupled with finding ejected cases,
suggests more than one gun – a revolver and a semi-
automatic – were used.


Someone with Gun Combat 2–3 might examine the
ejected cases and realise this particular ammunition
manufacturer is a favoured contractor to the world
government which does not sell ammunition to civilians.
A skill of Gun Combat 4 or more would allow a pretty
accurate reconstruction of who fired from where to be
conducted ‘by eye’ without sophisticated equipment.


The same information might be obtained by
investigation using appropriate skills but this would
require dice rolls whereas a suitably competent
Traveller will simply know the answers.

###### Alternate Play Styles


# C OMBAT

This chapter contains optional rules for combat
situations. As with all other material in this book, the
Referee must decide which, if any, of these rules
are to be in use. Some add realism or new combat
options, while others cover situations that might
arise during a campaign.

AMMUNITION EXPENDITURE
Travellers can only carry a limited amount of
ammunition – half a dozen rifle magazines represents
a significant amount of weight and bulk! This system
allows for the possibility that Travellers might run out of
ammunition during a firefight, without requiring them to
keep track of every shot fired.

An attack made with a firearm or energy weapon is
not necessarily a single shot. For every shot that has
a chance to hit the target, the Traveller may have fired
several more rounds or bursts that went nowhere
useful, which means that a weapon could be empty
after a single attack. This represents ‘walking’ a
weapon onto target or the general difficulty of hitting
anything under combat conditions.

Every weapon that uses ammunition has a chance
to run out whenever the Traveller makes an attack.
This is represented by rolling a dice of a different
colour along with the attack dice. If the ammunition
dice comes up equal to or below the weapon’s
Reload Threshold, the weapon is empty and must be
reloaded before firing again.

This does mean that a lucky Traveller might get
through a firefight lasting 15 combat rounds without
reloading his revolver. The Referee can deal with this
in one of two ways. The first is to assume that the
Traveller has had the opportunity to slip a couple of
rounds into the weapon now and then during lulls in
the action, or has swapped part-empty magazines
out whenever they could. Alternatively, the Referee
might impose common-sense limits on weapon
capacity – a six-shot revolver is definitely empty after
six attacks have been made.


The base Reload Threshold for most weapons is 2,
assuming a standard capacity weapon for its type.
This means that if the ammunition dice comes up a 1
or 2, the weapon is empty. Weapon modifications can
alter the Reload Threshold, as can the nature of the
attack being made.


To determine how Reload Threshold is affected,
start with the weapon’s normal mode of attack in the
Reloading table. Moving up the table reduces Reload
Threshold by -1 (to a minimum of 1), while moving
down increases it by +1. Weapons are still limited by
their maximum rate of fire – a revolver cannot deliver a
Very Rapid Fire attack!


In the case of weapons that only fire single shots, such
as a black powder pistol or disposable anti-tank missile,
the weapon automatically requires reloading after one
attack. Weapons such as a double-barrelled shotguns
are treated as manual repeaters for their first attack
and are assumed to be empty after the second.


Rate of Fire

- Aimed Fire
- Normal Attack
- Burst
- Autofire
- Rapid Fire
- Very Rapid Fire


DETERMINING RELOAD THRESHOLD
The Reload Threshold of a weapon is based on its
ammunition capacity relative to its normal mode of
operation, as shown on the Reload Threshold table.


Increasing ammunition capacity by 50% reduces the
Reload Threshold by 1, while increasing it by 100%
reduces Reload Threshold by 2, to a minimum of 1.
Some variation can be permitted here; a weapon
that is within +/1 20% of these figures qualifies
for the modification. Thus an assault rifle with a
42-round magazine counts as a 50% increase in
ammunition capacity.


TRAVELLER


Reload Threshold
Weapon Type Example Standard Capacity Mode of Operation
Manual Repeater Pump-action shotgun or revolver 6 Normal Attack
Semi-Automatic Carbine or Semi-automatic pistol 12 Normal Attack
Light Automatic Submachinegun or Assault Rifle 30 Burst
Support General-Purpose Machinegun 50 Autofire
Rapid Fire Weapon Vulcan Machinegun 250 Rapid Fire
Very Rapid Fire Weapon VRF Gauss Gun 1,000 Very Rapid Fire


USING END
The Endurance of a Traveller represents their natural
toughness and ability to shrug off at the harm they suffer.


NATURAL RESILIENCE
A Traveller’s END DM can be deducted from the
damage taken in each attack. If the END DM is
negative, this much damage is instead added to each
attack. This can make combat more dangerous for
low END Travellers.


KNOCKOUT BLOW
If a Traveller’s END is reduced from its starting value to
0 by a single attack, the character they are knocked out
instantly, despite them still having two characteristics
above zero. This is a good rule to introduce when the
Travellers are facing a large number of weaker foes.


Weapons that carry less than the standard
ammunition load have an increased Reload
Threshold. A weapon that has around two thirds
normal capacity increases reloading threshold by 1.
One third capacity increases it by 2.


For example, Cassandra is using a semi-automatic
pistol converted to full-automatic fire and has loaded
a 24-round extension magazine before the fight. This
is a roughly 50% increase in her normal ammunition
capacity so reduces Reload Threshold by -1, to 1.
If Cassandra takes careful aimed shots, her Reload
Threshold is in theory reduced by -1 but cannot go
below 1. However, she blazes away in full-automatic
mode. This moves her two rows down the table from
her weapons’ normal mode of attack, increasing the
Reload Threshold by +2, to 3. Cassandra rolls a 5 on
her first attack’s ammunition dice. She still has at least
one attack’s worth of ammunition left in her weapon.

50

###### Combat


**RANDOM FIRST BLOOD**
Instead of always applying damage to END first, the first
damage sustained in any combat is applied to a random
physical characteristic and further damage after that can
be allocated to any physical characteristic. This makes
a low END Traveller more survivable.

ALTERNATIVE INITIATIVE
Under this system, combat still takes place in six-
second rounds but there is no strict initiative order to
actions. Instead, everything that takes place in a given
round is assumed to be a mad scramble with many
things happening at once. All actions are resolved
and then the effects are implemented simultaneously.
Thus, a Traveller riddled with bullets as they swing their
sword may still land a blow, or two combatants might
shoot one another and collapse simultaneously.

This is not unrealistic. It is very rare for a weapon
to instantly ‘switch off’ a target, so a Traveller
committed to an action will carry it out before any
wounds they receive in the process take effect.
However, it does take time to cover a gap between
two combatants, so ranged attacks against targets
who are not already in close combat with the shooter
are resolved before the melee attack.

In a situation where a Traveller wants to do something
before someone else can act, such as shooting an
opponent as they are drawing a weapon or rushing
forward to attack with a knife, an opposed Initiative
check is made using the following procedure:

- Roll initiative as normal, using DEX or INT. The
    Effect of this check is the Traveller’s base initiative.
- If the Traveller has to take one very short action
    (e.g. stabbing with a hand weapon or pointing a
    gun), subtract -2 from the base initiative.
- If the Traveller has to take a longer action (e.g.
    drawing a weapon or crossing 2–3 metres to
    attack with a hand weapon), subtract -4 from the
    base initiative.
- If the Traveller has to take a complex or multiple
    action, (e.g. drawing a weapon and turning to
    point it at someone behind him, or drawing a
    sword whilst charging at the target), deduct -6
    from the base initiative.


If the difference between the two combatants’ initiative
is 6 or more, the faster combatant may carry out their
action and resolve its effects before the slower one
can do anything. If the slower combatant is rendered
incapable of acting (either by circumstances or
incapacitation) their action will not occur. If the slower
combatant is hurt but not incapacitated, DM-2 is applied
to their actions during that turn.


If the difference between the two combatants’ modified
initiative scores is less than 6, their actions are more
or less simultaneous. The faster Traveller may get off a
shot a split second before the axe swinging at his head
arrives but not in time to stop it.


For example, Arix the Accountant opens a door in an
enemy base and is spotted by a guard. The guard
draws his pistol and turns to face Arix, intending to
shoot him on sight. Arix steps back and slams shut the
heavy crystalliron door. Arix wants to act before his
opponent, for obvious reasons. He rolls initiative using
his INT modifier of +1 at a difficulty level of Average (8+)
and gets an 8 on the dice. With his INT modifier, this
gives Arix an Effect (and thus a base initiative) of +1.


The guard’s Initiative roll comes up 9 on the dice.
With his DEX modifier this gives an Effect of +2.
However, he is carrying out a complex action; drawing
and pointing his weapon as he turns. A -6 modifier is
imposed, giving a final modified initiative of -4.


The difference between +1 and -4 is 5 – not quite
enough! Arix slams the door and leans on it,
breathing heavily. For a second his buddies think he
closed it in time but then they see the blood seeping
through his jacket...


MATERIAL DESTRUCTION
In order to damage or destroy an object it is necessary
to hit it with a weapon or place explosives such that
they will cause harm. This presents little problem if
the Traveller is not interrupted. Attacks with hand
weapons on large inanimate objects (e.g. vehicles
or buildings) will usually hit them; Travellers simply
need to work out how much damage they deal. It is
necessary to roll to hit when attacking from a distance,
say with firearms or artillery fire, and explosives must
be planted using the appropriate skill.


51

###### Combat


TRAVELLER


Note that explosives rely to a great extent on blast
effect caused by air pressure (or pressure in some
other fluid such as water or the exotic gas mix of an
alien world). Without a medium to carry the blast it
is necessary for explosives to be in contact with the
target, enabling shock and the cutting effect of an
explosion to be carried through the target itself. This
means a satchel charge lobbed next to an enemy
ATV on an airless world may do no real damage to it,
although one detonating in contact with the vehicle
would be more destructive.


When an explosive device is detonated next to a target,
or when it is attacked with weapons, the target’s armour
Protection protects it from some (or perhaps all) of the
damage, after which its Structure value is reduced.
Damage is rolled as normal.


Impaling hand weapons and low-velocity projectiles like
arrows cannot be used to smash a solid object. Bullets
will work, eventually, as will vigorous bludgeoning with
a bladed implement or something heavy and blunt. It
is difficult enough to damage a target by this method;
completely destroying it would be a lengthy undertaking.


All objects have a Structure value which can be
degraded by damage. If it matters what sort of state an
object is in, the following levels are used:

- When an object has lost 50% of its Structure it is
    significantly damaged. Functionality is reduced
    by 50%. For all-or-nothing devices, this means a
    simple 50/50 chance of it working.
- When an object has lost 75% of its Structure it is
    seriously damaged. Functionality is reduced to 10%.
- An object that has lost 100% of its Structure ceases
    to function and may have lost important parts.


An object that has lost 100% of its Structure is not,
however, entirely destroyed. The damage listed in
the Inanimate Objects table is what is required to put
a roughly fist-sized hole in the object and/or prevent
it from functioning. Ten times as much damage will
put a human-sized hole in the object or completely
destroy something smaller than human sized. A
device will be wrecked beyond repair long before it is
physically smashed to pieces.


Sometimes, smashing things is not enough; they
must be blown to pieces instead. If explosives are
used, 10 times the Structure listed in the Inanimate
Objects table will shatter the target. 25 times the listed
Structure will utterly destroy the item and scatter its
parts across a satisfyingly large area. 50 times the
listed Structure will vaporise it and 100 times is just
silly... but entertaining to watch.


ADDITIONAL WOUND EFFECTS
In the Traveller Core Rulebook, a Traveller who has
all three of their physical characteristics reduced
to zero is dead. This system may be used at the
Referee’s discretion for Travellers and important non-
player characters.


A Traveller whose three attributes are at zero has
suffered a life-threatening injury, referred to as a
disabling wound. They will be down, unconscious (or
close to it) and unable to save themselves. However,
even without medical assistance, they might make a
miraculous recovery.

###### Combat


Where these rules refer to medical attention, they
do not mean a quick application of on-scene first
aid with no follow-up. First aid will keep a Traveller
with a severe wound from dying but will not prevent
permanent effects. Only successful surgery and long-
term care will suffice, requiring both medical skill and
suitable equipment.

**Disabling Wounds**


2D Result
2 or less The Traveller is vaporised, shredded,
spread all over the landscape or
otherwise destroyed in graphic and
gruesome fashion.
2–3 The Traveller is either killed outright in
a dramatic fashion such as having their
head blown off, or lingers just long enough
to make a final speech to their friends/
enemies/passers-by. They cannot be
saved in either case.
4–5 The Traveller will die unless given prompt
medical assistance. If they survive,
they will lose the limb that was injured,
or an eye, or suffer some similar major
permanent injury as determined by the
Referee. This can of course be repaired
with cybernetics but the process will be
slow and expensive.
6–7 The Traveller will die unless given prompt
medical assistance and suffer permanent
effects if they survive at all. Lose 1D from
any one of STR, DEX or END and D3 from
the others.
8–9 The Traveller will survive if given even
the most basic emergency assistance
and suffer no ill effects providing they
receive proper medical treatment whilst
recovering. If it is not, the Traveller will
permanently lose D3 points from both STR
and END.
10–11 The Traveller will survive despite their
injuries, even without assistance, and will
make a full recovery if medical attention is
successfully provided.
12+ The Traveller is terribly hurt but will
somehow cling to life and begin to recover
even if medical attention is not provided.


When a Traveller takes a disabling wound, roll 2D
on the following Disabling Wounds table, with the
Traveller’s END modifier as a DM. In addition, the
following modifiers are used:


Combat Mishaps
2D Result
2 Shoot or hit themself for normal
weapon damage.
3–4 The weapon is dropped somewhere
inaccessible. It cannot be retrieved
during this fight and if the Travellers are
forced to flee it will not be recoverable.
5–6 The weapon is dropped but in sight. It
can be recovered in a future round using
a significant action.
7 A minor weapon malfunction or loss
of proper grip has occurred. Any
attack made this round is wasted but
the weapon can be brought back into
action by making an Easy (6+) skill
check next round. This takes significant
action and, if failed, the attempt must
be repeated every round.
8–9 A serious weapon malfunction has
occurred, putting the weapon out of

ICOMBAT MISHAPS
The addition of Mishaps to the combat rules creates a
possibility that even the most skilled of Travellers can
have a bad day. If a combat-related skill check comes up
a double-1 and is also a failure, a Mishap has occurred.
If the skill check was so easy that the double-1 still
succeeds, there is no Mishap but the attack still fails.


If a Mishap does occur, roll 2D + the Traveller’s weapon
skill on the Combat Mishaps table.

HIT LOCATIONS
Sometimes it can be important to know where a blow or
shot landed. This can be abstracted from the damage
dice – a high damage score suggests something
important has been hit; lower damage indicates a
less critical area. However, with some kinds of armour
offering only partial coverage, a system for resolving
where a Traveller is hit may sometimes be useful.


A Minor Wound is inflicted if damage is less than
half the Traveller’s END score. Minor wounds have
no additional effects.


A Major Wound is inflicted if the Traveller receives
between half his END score and his full END score in a
single instance. A major wound will affect the Traveller’s
ability to carry out actions relevant to the damaged
body part until it is healed.


A Severe Wound is inflicted if the Traveller receives
more than his END score. A Severe wound will cause
the Traveller to lose consciousness and will have
serious consequences even after he recovers.


The consequences of a wound persist even after the
Traveller has recovered any END points after a fight.
Healing from a Major wound requires a successful
routine (6+) Medic check and D3 days of recuperation.
A Severe wound requires an Average (8+) Medic check
and 1D days of recuperation, after which the Traveller
suffers the effects of a Major wound for another D3 days.


The effects of even more severe wounds are likely to
be irrelevant; receiving more than twice the Traveller’s
END score will likely kill him. If further wound effects
are desired, the following rules can be applied:


A Crippling wound results from taking at least twice
the Traveller’s END score in one attack. If the wound
is survived, the location hit is completely out of action
and suffers permanent damage. STR, END or DEX
(selected at random) is reduced by D3.


A Critical wound results from taking at least three
times the Traveller’s END score in one attack. If the
Traveller survives, the location hit is completely out of
action and suffers permanent damage. STR, END or
DEX are reduced by D3+1 each.


A Mortal wound results from taking at least four
times the Traveller’s END score in one attack. This
is unlikely to be survivable and is sufficient to shear
off a limb or decapitate a Traveller. If the Traveller
somehow survives they will need to replace or
regrow a limb or some organs.


A Devastating wound results from taking at least
five times the target’s END score or more in a single
attack. The location struck is completely destroyed,
vapourised or smashed beyond recognition. This is
mainly a cinematic effect but can have implications
when facing certain foes.


1D Location
1 Head
2 Arms
3–5 Torso
6 Legs


GENERAL HIT LOCATION
When a Traveller is struck by a weapon, roll on the
Locations table to determine the precise location struck.


Most attacks tend to be directed at the centre of body
mass, which is also where most vital organs are
located. Fortunately, the torso is the easiest part of a
Traveller to armour. Many armour types – such as a
flak jacket – protect only the torso but represent a good
bargain in terms of weight and coverage as there is a
good chance an attack will strike there.


If a Traveller is hit in a particular location, the default
option is that they gain the benefit of the best armour
they are wearing on that location. If additional detail
is required, the Referee may impose a check to see
if armour was hit or an exposed area struck. For
example, if a Traveller is hit on the head whilst his
vacc suit faceplate is open, the Referee might impose
a check to see if the weapon entered the Traveller’s
helmet or struck an armoured area. This is more detail
than most Traveller games really need, however, so
should only be used in critical situations.


WOUND EFFECTS
In general, the severity of an injury is indicated by the
amount of damage it deals. However, blows and shots
to particular locations may have specific effects. There
are three levels of wound severity: Minor, Major and
Severe. The amount of damage required to inflict these
wounds is based upon the Traveller’s starting END.

54

###### Combat


**Wound Effects**


Location Major Wound Severe Wound
Head DM-1 on all checks. DM-2 on all checks.
Arms DM-1 on all checks involving the arms. DM-1 on all checks involving the arms.
Torso DM-1 on all physical checks; speed
reduced by 1m.


DM-2 on all physical checks. Traveller can only crawl
unless supported.
Legs Speed reduced by 2m. DM-1 on all
movement-based checks.


Leg disabled; Traveller can only hobble slowly with
support. No movement-based activity is possible.

**UNUSUAL CREATURES**
Some creatures do not obey the usual rules for
damage. For example, dispersed creatures without
the organs most animals have might be more difficult
to stop than their END score suggests. For example,
a crippling wound to a dispersed creature’s tentacle
might be sufficient to disable it and allow the Travellers
to escape; in this case the effect of the wound is more
important than the damage delivered, as the creature
will not be rendered unconscious by loss of END points
in the conventional manner.

For another example, the Travellers are investigating
a derelict space station whose inhabitants have been
turned into zombie-like creatures by alien spores
infesting their nervous system. After seeing Cassandra
riddle a couple of them with pistol bullets to no effect,
Mike the Marine realises they need to be shot apart
to stop them. He takes careful aim and blasts one (a
former dock worker with an END of 8) in the leg with
his shotgun. Rolling damage, Mike gets a total of 17
points – enough for a Crippling wound. The spore-
zombie’s leg is completely out of action. It continues
to crawl towards Mike, who can now easily avoid its
advance providing he maintains a brisk walking pace.


Meanwhile, Arix the Accountant has found a plasma
gun. He is not a great shot but manages to hit one of
the spore-zombies. A roll for hit location comes up a 1;
the head. Rolling damage for his 1DD weapon, Arix gets
a 4, 40 points of damage! The spore-zombie’s head is
completely vaporised along with a chunk of its torso and
a nearby wall. What remains of the spore-zombie is no
longer a threat. Arix nods in grim satisfaction.


SPECIFIC LOCATIONS
The Traveller Core Rulebook assumes that Travellers
are shooting at the centre of body mass and that
limbs or heads are hit more or less by accident. If a
Traveller wants to shoot or strike at a specific body
part they may try to do so. Hitting a specific location
is tricky even with an aimed shot and is subject to
DM-2. If using more rapid-fire modes of combat,
DM-6 is used instead. Failure indicates the target
has been completely missed.


The main benefits of shooting at specific locations are
to bypass cover or armour, for example shooting an
opponent in the leg if his torso is armoured. A wound
to a specific location will have the effects noted under
Wound Effects, depending on its severity.

WEAPON SCANNERS


AND SEARCHES
Getting past weapon scanners is not a combat action –
unless something goes very badly wrong, perhaps – but
it can be important if combat occurs within a secured
area. There are essentially two ways weapons can
be detected: by technical means (scanners) and by a
search made by security personnel.


Attempts to bypass security by having weapons
brought in elsewhere or by negating the security (such
as by bribing guards to allow a person or container
to pass unsearched) are not covered here. We are
purely concerned with attempts to sneak a weapon
past the security station.


55

###### Combat


TRAVELLER


How difficult an item is to slip through security depends
on its size and how much like a weapon it appears. If
scanners are in use, the composition of the weapon
also matters. The modifiers here assume an object
is no larger than a typical handgun and shaped like a
recognisable weapon. The following DMs are applied if
the weapon differs from this basic type:


Weapon is disassembled or concealed (weapon is
concealed inside some innocent looking object, or is
in parts dispersed where they will seem to be normal
components of the Traveller’s luggage): DM+4


Weapon does not look like a weapon (weapon is
disguised somehow): DM+2


Weapon is very small (small knife, tiny high-tech
projectile or energy weapon): DM+1


Weapon is small (compact handgun, body pistol or
similar weapon): DM+0


Weapon is large (Bulky handgun, very small
submachinegun): DM-2


Weapon is very large (submachinegun or laser
carbine): DM-4


Weapon is extremely large (Rifle or light
machinegun): DM-6


Note that in this case ‘large’ and ‘extremely large’
simply mean the weapon is big enough to be difficult
to conceal and will tend to attract notice even if it is
disguised as something else.


DIRECT SEARCHES
Direct searches are available at any Tech Level and
are not always intrusive. At the most basic, security
personnel may be simply looking for weapon-shaped
objects or strange bulges in clothing. They will also try
to ‘read’ people to see who looks a little bit ‘off’. Anyone
who stands out – such as being unduly nervous – may
be searched more diligently. A member of an alien
species or culture with unusual or difficult to read
mannerisms may attract more or less attention than
more typical starfarers.


To get past a simple visual search – i.e. the guards
are simply looking people over to see if they are
behaving oddly or carrying something they should
not – requires an opposed Persuade or Stealth check
against the Recon skill of the guards. DM-2 applies
to the Travellers’ check if the guards are unusually
alert. Very alert guards, or those who are looking for a
weapon they are sure is there somewhere, will conduct
a diligent search, inflicting DM-4.


Direct searches take time and are typically used where
technical means are not available or where suspicion
has been aroused. Arguably, Travellers will encounter
a simple visual search any time security personnel look
at them but if they seem to be going about their normal
business and do not have weapons on display they will
not attract attention and the ‘search’ can be assumed
to have been nothing more than a cursory glance.
Essentially this means that unless the Travellers are
stupid or careless they will not have to make a check
every time a security officer walks by.


TECHNOLOGICAL SEARCHES
Technological weapon searches become possible at
TL4, with metal detectors used to spot items. Metal
detectors, as the name suggests, can only detect
items that contain metal. A ceramic knife, or body pistol
made from non-metallic components, will automatically
pass the scanner. Note that handgun ammunition is
normally of metal, so a non-metallic weapon needs to
be accompanied by non-metallic ammunition.


Metal detectors are all-or-nothing devices. If any
significant amount of metal is present the detector
will pick it up if it is calibrated properly. If the detector
is triggered, security personnel will investigate and
a direct search will be made. On some occasions
a metal detector will be badly calibrated and metal
objects will not be detected. This is a matter of good
luck or judgement on the Travellers’ part however,
and can be done by making a Very Difficult (12+)
Streetwise check to pick a time when the detectors are
not working properly.


At TL7, complex scanners become available which
include metal detection, ultrasound or ‘soft’ X-ray
imaging to build up a picture of what is under clothing
or inside luggage, and higher-tech sensors such
as nuclear magnetic resonance devices which can
tell what materials are present. Chemical detection
systems can spot explosives (and other compounds) by
sampling the air around a Traveller. This includes most
propellants used in firearm ammunition.

56

###### Combat


From TL7 upwards, weapon detection suites become
steadily more sophisticated. The base difficulty to
get any weapon through security is Average (8+); the
Persuade or Stealth skill can be used depending on
whether the Traveller wants to hide the item and hope it
is not discovered or rely on it not being recognised. The
Tech Level of the detection suite is used as a negative
DM on this check, so slipping a handgun through a TL8
detection suite requires an Average check at DM-8.
Modifiers for size and concealment still apply.

For ‘stealth’ weapons designed to defeat security, a
DM+1 applies for every two full Tech Levels of the item,
in addition to the previous modifiers.

Laser weapons do not use explosives and may not
be shaped like standard firearms, so gain DM+2
to defeat conventional scanners. However, from
TL9 upwards detection suites contain an energy
emissions detector that will be set off by a powerpack

- the same applies to the batteries in gauss weapons
and other powered weaponry. This will trigger a
direct search unless the power unit is convincingly
disguised as something innocuous.

As a baseline, it is reasonable to assume that most
starports where weapons are restricted have at
least TL12 detection equipment. Better detectors
may be used on higher-tech worlds; lower-tech
operators will usually import them if they hope to
restrict weapons use.

For example, Cassandra wants to slip a gun into the
heavily secured starport. She chooses a TL10 body
pistol and dismantles it, concealing it throughout
her luggage inside items that look innocuous on a
scanner. The port has TL12 detection equipment, so
Cassandra is trying to make an Average (8+) Stealth
check at DM-12. She gains DM+5 (half her stealth


weapon’s Tech Level) plus DM+4 because the weapon
is dismantled and concealed in parts, and another
DM+1 because she is using a smaller than average
weapon. This is a net DM-2, making the Stealth check
a tricky challenge but doable.


GETTING CAUGHT
Travellers who get caught with weapons they are not
supposed to have may face serious consequences.
However, they might be able to reduce those
consequences. If the weapon is within one Law Level
of what is allowed (for example a small submachinegun
in an area where handguns are allowed), the Traveller
may face only a token fine and refused entry provided
they can provide a suitable excuse. A gun carelessly
left in a bag from the Travellers’ last stop – a lawless
freeport – will attract less official displeasure than a
disassembled body pistol the Traveller was clearly
trying to smuggle into a secured area.


The Traveller thus has a chance to blag their way
out of the situation and escape with only a token
fine (3D x Law Level in Credits) and a stern warning.
To do so, the Traveller must make an Easy (4+)
Persuade or Diplomat check with the world’s Law
Level as a negative DM.


The Traveller will not be permitted entry to the secured
area with the weapon. It may be confiscated, or
returned to allow the Traveller to put it in his ship’s gun
locker where it belongs. The Traveller will be subject to
greater scrutiny when they next present themselves at
security, assuming they are allowed entry at all.


Getting caught with very illegal weapons, or where the
Travellers are obviously trying to smuggle weaponry
into an area rather than just making a dumb mistake,
is grounds for arrest and a first-hand encounter with
the local judicial system. Any weapon two Law Levels
or more above what is legal (such as a military gauss
rifle in an area where only shotguns are permitted), or
which seems to be intended for criminal purposes, will
result in automatic arrest.


The Travellers’ fate is determined by rolling 2D on the
Sentencing table (see the Traveller Core Rulebook,
page 225), at DM-4.


The Travellers may be able to circumvent this
process by various means, such as presenting faked
(or even real!) diplomatic identification documents,
bribing or suborning the guards, or otherwise
sidestepping the problem.

# G

## RAVITY AND

## RELATED EFFECTS

The gravitational forces experienced in an
environment can have very significant effects on
Travellers. The following general definitions are
useful as a starting point.

Gravity is rated in G, equivalent to the average
surface gravity on Earth. 1G of surface gravity
produces an acceleration on a falling object of 9.81
metres per second squared, usually rounded up to a
convenient 10m/s squared.

Microgravity is defined as ‘no significant gravitational
effects’ such as deep space or orbit around a planet, far
enough out that its gravity does not significantly affect
objects or people. Note that space vessels in orbit
are held by gravity but still experience no significant
gravitational effects on the crew.

Minimal Gravity is defined as where there is a
significant (noticeable) gravitational pull but less than
0.2G. In the Sol system, the surface of Pluto has
a gravity of 0.05G; Titan has 0.14G and the Moon
(Luna) has 0.17G. Most asteroids and moons have
minimal gravity conditions.

**Very Low Gravity** is between 0.2–0.4G and might
be encountered on a small planet like Mercury
(0.39G), or a larger but not very dense one like Mars
(0.38G). Very low gravity is sufficient to retain an
atmospheric envelope, although not a substantial
one. Small planets (Size 3 or less) typically have very
low gravity conditions and can retain only a trace
atmosphere. This is not sufficient to breathe even
with a compressor mask and a pressure suit would be
necessary for humans.

**Low Gravity** is between 0.4–0.7G and is sufficient to
support a decent atmosphere, although it would be
too thin for humans to breathe unaided. A pressure
suit would not be necessary in such an atmosphere,
although operating without one would be uncomfortable.
A compressor mask or air supply is necessary.

Standard Gravity falls in the range 0.7–1.4Gs and
allows the normal range of human activities without
many problems. Earth’s gravity is rated as 1G, with
Neptune (1.14G) and Saturn (1.11G) being higher
and Venus (0.91G) and Uranus (0.88G) being lower.


Normally a standard-gravity world can retain any
atmosphere type but extremely dense types are
unlikely. However, large worlds have deep enough
atmospheres to be extremely dense at low altitudes
even if gravity is not especially high.


High Gravity, ranging from 1.4–1.8G, is tolerable
by humans for extended periods but unaccustomed
individuals will tire quickly and accidental injuries are
likely. High gravity worlds tend to have thick,
dense atmospheres.


Extreme Gravity (upwards of 1.8G) is dangerous
and not commonly encountered (Jupiter’s ‘surface’
gravity of 2.33G is an exception but it is not possible
for humans to survive there so the point is academic).
Note that humans can tolerate much higher forces
for short periods, especially if they are oriented
properly or have the correct equipment. For example,
a race driver may walk away from a crash in which
he momentarily experienced as much as 250G and
fighter pilots can remain conscious in a brief 9G turn.
However, just a couple of G in the wrong direction
(forcing blood into the brain instead of out of it) can
cause ‘red out’ and render the same pilot helpless.


Low and high gravity conditions are primarily
important to Travellers with a propensity for falling off
things but unusual gravity makes all manner of tasks
increasingly tricky. It also affects the sort of plants
and animals that exist in the environment. High
gravity worlds typically have vegetation that clings
to surfaces whilst creatures tend to be squat and
compact. Lower gravity environments produce taller
creatures and plants.


Gravity Types
World Size Code Gravity Type
0 Microgravity
1–2 Minimal
3–4 Very Low
5–6 Low
7–8 Standard
9–10 High
Unusually large, dense planet Extreme



Anyone who does not have experience of microgravity
(indicated by the possession of skills such as Athletics
(dexterity) and Vacc Suit) suffers DM-2 on all physical
actions, even if firmly anchored.


OPERATING IN LOW GRAVITY
At the higher end of the low-gravity spectrum,
operating in low gravity is not difficult even for those
unaccustomed to it. Little mistakes are common, such as
failing to estimate how fast an object will fall or moving
too quickly and losing balance, but the single biggest
problem for most is poor contact with the ground.


Those raised in a normal gravity environment tend to
take it for granted that they will be firmly rooted when
they carry out an action. However, this may not be
the case unless they take due care, which can lead to
overbalancing even when doing something as simple
as reaching for an object on a shelf or opening a
refrigerator door. Steps also tend to be quite long and
bounding, which can result in a lack of coordination
between legs and body.


For every 0.25G difference between the gravity a
Traveller is used to and the gravity they experience,
DM-1 is imposed on all physical actions. Assume a
‘home’ gravity of 1G for most people living and working
in space, as most space stations and a starships are
maintained at this level. The DM is increased by +1 for
every level of the character’s highest relevant skill, up
to DM+0. Normally this will be Athletics (dexterity) or
Vacc Suit but others may be used if applicable.


FIGHTING IN LOW-G AND MICROGRAVITY
Fighting in low gravity can be a tricky business
for those not used to it. Objects do not fall in the
expected manner, projectiles follow a flatter path
and it is very hard to absorb any sort of force without
being pushed or disorientated. In low gravity there is
less force holding a Traveller to the ground and it is
therefore much more difficult to establish a solid base
to fight or shoot from.


Hand weapons are particularly difficult to use as they
require interaction with the environment (usually the
ground) to enable the user to generate force. An
inexperienced combatant might send himself bouncing
off the walls instead of delivering a powerful cutlass
blow. Most projectile weapons generate sufficient recoil
to send the firer spinning and for this reason energy
weapons such as lasers are often favoured by those
expecting to fight in low gravity conditions.

Very dense worlds can have higher than average
gravity for their size – although normally no more than
one or two categories higher. Similarly, some worlds
are composed of low-density materials and may have
gravity a category lower than indicated.

OPERATING IN MICROGRAVITY
Sometimes referred to as zero-gravity, microgravity
is a situation where gravitational forces are minimal.
However, this does not mean objects lack mass or
inertia. A cargo crate that has started moving will still
crush a Traveller and require some force to get it
moving or to stop. Operating in microgravity can be
tricky and sometimes dangerous.

Microgravity is encountered aboard space craft
without artificial gravity (or devices like spin sections
to simulate it) and when operating on or around very
small bodies like comets or small moonlets. For
example, Deimos, one of the moons of Mars, has a
surface gravity of 0.0004G and can be considered a
microgravity environment.

One of the hidden hazards of microgravity is that
objects do not fall. That means something moving
towards a Traveller will get there eventually; it will not
drop to the deck and stop. Similarly, a Traveller who
loses contact with other objects can end up stranded
just centimetres from something they could grab or
push themself off. It is possible to jump off a small
body like an asteroid and simply float away into the
void. Thus it is commonplace for spacers to use tethers
when working in such an environment, even if thrusters
and reaction packs are available for manoeuvring.

Despite the fact that microgravity is sometimes called
‘free-fall’, there is no such thing as falling in the
conventional sense in this environment. It is, however,
possible to float at some speed for a considerable
distance and smash into something. The Traveller
does not accelerate as they would in a true fall but will
be helpless to avoid a collision unless they can grab
something or otherwise arrest their movement. Thus it
is reasonable to say that actions taken in microgravity
have permanent consequences and need to be
considered in that light before acting. Those who want
to jump from one handhold to another need to be very
skilled and not make any mistakes.

Microgravity is an entirely alien environment for most.
Objects do not behave as they ‘should’ and even
concepts like up and down can become confused.


59

###### GRAVITY AND RELATED EFFECTS


TRAVELLER


As per the Traveller Core Rulebook, any Traveller
who uses a ranged weapon that does not have the
Zero-G trait, or who attacks with a melee weapon,
must make an Average (8+) Athletics (dexterity)
check to avoid spinning out of control. The attack
automatically misses if this is failed. If the Traveller
has the Profession (hostile environment) skill, this
may be substituted for the Athletics check. This also
allows the Traveller to use a weapon that delivers 1D
of damage per level of skill without having to make the
check at all; this includes melee weapons.


A Traveller who is disoriented after failing this check
will fall to the ground, albeit slowly, and be brought
to a stop. This takes D3 rounds, during which they
can try to orient themselves with an Average (8+)
Athletics (dexterity) check, although Profession
(hostile environment/low-G) can be used instead. In
microgravity or true zero-G conditions, the Traveller will
spin forever if something does not stop them.


Another Traveller can rescue them by grabbing them
but this risks both going out of control. A Routine (6+)
Athletics (dexterity) check is needed to avoid being
sent out of control whilst undertaking a rescue.


If the spinning Traveller wants to carry on fighting
regardless, or take some action other than self-
rescue, all checks are subject to DM-2. It is possible
to shoot a firearm or make an attack in such a way
as to counteract the spin but this is highly unlikely to
succeed. Both the attack and chance to correct the spin
are subject to the usual penalty for doing two things
at once, so the Traveller needs to make Difficult (10+)
check to attack and to right themselves, whilst subject
to DM-2 for being out of control in the first place.


OPERATING IN HIGH GRAVITY
High gravity makes even simple tasks tiring and often
more dangerous. Falls in particular are extremely
dangerous and it can be difficult to estimate how much
effort will be needed to carry out a given task. As a
result, DM-1 is applied to all tasks for every 0.25G
difference between the Traveller’s home gravity and
their current environment.


High gravity also causes Travellers to fatigue very
rapidly. A Traveller undertaking intense activity such as
hard physical labour or hand-to-hand combat, reduces
their effective END by -2 each round. This END is
recovered at the rate of 1 point per round of rest. If it
reaches zero, the Traveller can do nothing but gasp for
breath until effective END is once again positive.


All Travellers not adapted to a very high gravity
environment (perhaps by way of genetic or cybernetic
enhancement) suffer DM-4 to all actions. This DM can
be reduced by one for every level of Profession (hostile
environment/high-G) the Traveller has. An Effect of -6
on any action, even something as simple as firing a
weapon, indicates the Traveller has strained themselves,
fallen over, or otherwise fallen foul of the high-G
conditions. They take 1D damage, ignoring armour.
This will happen even to Travellers with the Profession
(hostile environment/high-G) skill, but is less likely.


Extremely high gravity – anything over 2.5G – cannot
be tolerated for more than a few moments without
artificial assistance. Someone strapped into an
acceleration couch can still operate controls even
under extreme gravity conditions but moving around
unsupported becomes virtually impossible. All tasks
suffer DM- 8, again reduced by the level of Profession
(hostile environment/high-G) the Traveller possesses
and the consequences of a mishap (Effect -6 or worse
on any check) is 2D damage.


FIGHTING IN HIGH-GRAVITY
Fighting in a high-G environment is subject to the
penalties above. There are no additional penalties,
although projectile weapons are reduced in range. For
every G above 1, projectile weapon ranges are halved;
this does not apply to energy weapons such as lasers.


CHANGING GRAVITY
One technique used by spacer crews to defeat
boarders is grimly named ‘grav pong’, consisting of
using artificial gravity to repeatedly smash intruders
against the deck. Most ships and stations have
unidirectional artificial gravity, i.e. the field cannot
be reversed to send a victim up to the ceiling before
pulling them back down, but such as system could
be implemented. Likewise, few designers are willing
to go to the expense of creating long corridors
with dedicated gravity systems that turn them into
deathtraps. There are still ways that a Traveller might
fall ‘along’ a corridor, however.

60

###### GRAVITY AND RELATED EFFECTS


More commonly, grav pong takes the form of cutting
artificial gravity in an area then turning it back on.
Anyone caught may be able to position themselves so
they land feet-first when the gravity comes back on,
in which case they suffer no harm. This requires an
Average (8+) Athletics (dexterity) check. Those who
fail the check tumble when the gravity is cut. If they do
not reorient themselves in time, they will fall awkwardly,
although not from any great height. The result is 1D
damage from a normal internal gravity system. This
damage is reduced to D3 if the Traveller makes a
Difficult (10+) Athletics (dexterity) check or uses a
similar relevant skill such as Vacc Suit.

**GRAVITY, G-FORCES AND FALLING**
Per the Traveller Core Rulebook, falling damage in
normal gravity environment is 1D per two metres fallen,
plus 1D per four metres in a high-gravity (up to 2G)
environment and minus 1D per four metres in a low-
gravity environment. The following rules can be used to
replace this system.

**FALL-LIKE SITUATIONS**
As noted elsewhere, ‘falling’ as such does not really
happen in microgravity, although a fast-moving
Traveller might crash into something. A Traveller can
be subjected to a fall-like situation if a starship begins
accelerating with the internal gravity turned off, making
long fore-and-aft corridors dangerous. If artificial gravity
is on, Travellers will be in contact with the floor or other
surfaces and will not slide far. If they are floating around
unsecured, they will ‘fall’ along the corridor. Aboard a
high-G ship this can be fatal, although it is possible to
slow the ‘fall’ by friction with the sides of the corridor.

In a fall-like situation like this, treat the distance the
Traveller is accelerated for as the distance fallen.
This will usually be the distance they travel before
hitting an object but if the ship’s drives are only on
for a moment the Traveller will coast the rest of the
way and be hurt less.

A Traveller may reduce the effective G-force
experienced by the Effect (in Gs) of an Average (8+)
Athletics (dexterity) check. Microgravity imposes
DM-2 on all skill checks for those without relevant
skills; this applies despite there being a gravity-like
effect occurring.

Gravity-like effects greater than 2Gs increase
falling damage.


SOFT AND HARD LANDINGS
Falling damage assumes the Traveller falls on
something hard such as rock or hard earth. A
more yielding surface such as water or springy turf
reduces the effective distance of a fall by 20%. A very
yielding surface such as a deep pile of hay reduces
fall distance by 40%.


Travellers who fall onto a surface that can cause
damage in its own right may suffer harm even if the fall
does none. A modestly hazardous surface like rough
rocks inflicts +1D damage on the Traveller, whilst very
hazardous surfaces with numerous sharp edges and
points inflict +2D damage. Extremely hazardous areas
festooned with stalagmites or artificial spikes will inflict
+4D damage in addition to the fall. Armour protects
normally against this damage.


COLLISIONS AND FALLING OBJECTS
A fall is, in reality, a form of collision between a small
object (like a Traveller) and a large one (like a planet).
However, it is simpler to consider the incident only in
the context of the Traveller. Likewise, the effect on one
object is often irrelevant, such as when an out of control
vacc-suited Traveller slams into a cargo container. The
container can be assumed to have suffered minimal
damage at most. Collisions between smaller objects
might have more mutually detrimental effects.

A small but reasonably heavy thrown object can
be assumed to do 1D damage. Something heavier
like a rock that requires both hands to throw would
normally do 2D. This assumes a short fall or an
object thrown by muscle power. Larger or heavier
objects will do more damage.


Vehicle or starship-sized objects will normally crush
something as insignificant as a Traveller into a pulp.
For expediency, the Referee may invoke this ‘meat
paste’ rule for anyone hit by a falling object the size of a
vehicle or starship.


A Traveller who has no warning cannot avoid
something falling on them, except by blind luck.
In the situation where a Traveller is caught in a
meteorite shower or under falling rocks, the Referee
might call for an Average (8+) check with no skill or
attribute applying (Luck could be used if it has been
used as an additional characteristic). A Traveller who
fails the check takes a number of dice damage equal
to the negative Effect of the roll. Armour will usually
protect in this case.


However, if the Traveller looks up in time or is
otherwise warned, they have two chances to mitigate
or avoid damage. Both of these apply to falling
objects and other collisions.


First, the Traveller may dive, roll, scramble or otherwise
get out of the way. This requires an Average (8+)
Athletics (dexterity) check. If the object is vehicle-
sized or larger, DM-4 applies. A starship-sized object
increases the penalty to DM-12. Of course, a falling
boulder the size of a merchant starship falling at great
speed is not only a starship-sized object, it is also a
fairly significant geophysical event.


If the Traveller makes their check, they get out of the
way and suffer no damage. If they fail, they suffer
the damage determined on the Falling Objects table.
However, it is possible to mitigate the effects to
some extent.


A Traveller about to be hit by a falling object or
otherwise involved in a collision may attempt an
Athletics (dexterity) check (with no penalties for the
size of the object) to roll with the collision, try to bounce
off rather than take the full impact, or at least to cover
their head and take the worst of it on their arms rather
than skull. If the check is successful, damage from the
collision is reduced by 1 point per dice.


Worn armour does not help against collisions with
large objects. It will protect normally against a thrown
rock or similar object but larger objects will crush
armour and inflict damage right through it. Flexible
armour has no effect on impacts with large objects
but there are exceptions:

- Rigid armour such as battle dress or a hostile
    environment suit protects at full value against
    crushing impacts.
- A Traveller wearing a hard hat or suitable helmet
    may count this at full value against damage
    inflicted by an object falling from above.


DAMAGE FROM FALLING OBJECTS
The damage inflicted by a falling object depends upon
its mass and local gravity conditions. The object will
usually suffer the same amount of damage but this is
rarely relevant:

- Light objects include relatively small but dense
    items like a rifle magazine or can of soup.
- Medium objects are equivalent to a fist-sized rock.
- Heavy objects are equivalent to a head-sized rock.
- Very Heavy objects are equivalent to a large rock
    that can be picked up in both hands.


Larger objects the size of vehicles (anything that
requires more than one person to lift it fits into this
category) are also rated light to very heavy but are
considered to be Destructive objects when hitting a
Traveller. Any modifier to damage is also multiplied by
ten, so a light vehicle falling six metres in heavy gravity
will do 6D+6 damage, multiplied by 10:

- Light vehicles are equivalent to a motorcycle or
    large animal like a horse.
- Medium vehicles are equivalent to a small family
    car or very large and heavy animal such as a rhino.
- Heavy vehicles are equivalent to a minibus or
    similarly large vehicle, or an elephant.
- Very Heavy vehicles are equivalent to an
    articulated truck or gigantic animal such as a
    whale. Being hit by a falling whale is grounds for
    both using the ‘meat paste’ rule and asking some
    questions about the Traveller’s lifestyle.


There is really no way a Traveller can survive being
hit by a falling spaceship. However, for completeness
we will consider various starship-grade objects in
case a collision between a train and a horse occurs
and someone absolutely insists on rolling all the dice.

**Falling Objects**


Object Damage from and to Object
Light Object 1D per metre fallen
Medium Object 2D per metre fallen
Heavy Object 3D per metre fallen
Very Heavy Object 4D per metre fallen
Gravity Damage Modifier
Low Gravity -1 per dice
High Gravity (up to 2g) +1 per dice
Each 2g thereafter +1 additional damage per dice

A starship-sized object counts as Doubly Destructive
when hitting something smaller, multiplying the
damage by 100:

- Light starships are equivalent to a cargo shuttle
    or maritime patrol boat. A light railroad train,
    consisting of just a couple of carriages, would also
    count as a light starship.
- Medium starships are equivalent to a corvette or
    maritime combat vessel. A large goods train would
    also be considered an object of this type.
- Heavy starships are equivalent to a maritime or
    space-going frigate, or a small freighter.
- Very Heavy starships are equivalent to a
    maritime or space-going light cruiser, or a mid-
    sized freighter.
- Huge starships include heavy cruisers or large
    liners. Such an object would roll 5D per metre
    fallen, with modifiers, if it really matters.
- Enormous starships include battleships and bulk
    freighters. Damage would be 6D per metre fallen,
    with modifiers.


DETERMINING DAMAGE FROM COLLISIONS
When two Travellers run into one another, the results
tend to be survivable. However, being run into by a
train or charging rhino is a rather more serious event. In
a collision, an object delivers damage equal to 1D per
Speed Band it was travelling at, modified by the relative
size of the object as per falling damage on page 61.


A person or similar sized object that is free to move
will simply be pushed aside by a vehicle or starship
travelling at Idle. No damage is taken if the Traveller
can make an Average (8+) Athletics (dexterity) check.


Armour does not normally protect against the impact
or crushing effect of a collision. However, it will protect
against additional damage caused by projections,
spikes, antlers or other potentially dangerous parts of a
creature or vehicle.


Travellers inside a vehicle that collides with something
will usually be thrown around and collide with internal
surfaces. Damage from such a collision is 1D per
Speed Band of the collision, modified as follows:

- A normal vehicle or starship will absorb some of
    the energy of impact, reducing the damage by 1D.
- A vehicle designed to protect its occupants (with
    crumple zones and airbags, for example) reduces
    damage by 2D.
- If the Traveller is strapped into a seat with a good
    harness, such as a pilot’s chair, damage is reduced
    by an additional 1D.
- A survival cocoon or similar device designed to
    protect its occupants reduces damage by an
    additional 2D, provided the occupants are properly
    secured in crash seats or couches.

# A TMOSPHERE AND VACUUM

Humans and most similar creatures need a particular
mix of gases, at roughly the right temperature and
pressure, to survive. Even if these conditions are met
there may be something in the air that is harmful or
even fatal. A fluid environment such as underwater is
an atmosphere of sorts, although the greater densities
of fluids result in a much quicker increase in pressure
as depth increases.

PRESSURE
Almost any conceivable kind of creature requires
gas or fluid around it to balance its own internal
pressure. A science-fiction game like Traveller can
stretch a point to allow extremely low-pressure or
even vacuum dwelling animals, but they are likely to
be rare and highly unusual.

The baseline for measuring atmospheric pressure is
that of Earth’s atmosphere at sea level, a measure
imaginatively known as one Atmosphere. The following
general levels of pressure are used in Traveller:

Hard Vacuum (Atmosphere 0) means there is no (or
virtually no) gas pressure. Hard vacuum will render
humans unconscious in 10–15 seconds or so and kill
them within two or three minutes.

Partial Vacuum (Atmosphere 0) means there may be
some air or other gases present but full protective gear
is needed. Partial vacuum will kill a human about half
as fast as hard vacuum, basically just ensuring the
victim suffers for a while longer.

Trace (or minimal) Atmosphere (Atmosphere 1) is
not breathable by humans but will not kill them quickly.
Enough gas pressure exists that an unprotected
person could function for a few minutes so long as
an air supply was available. Prolonged exposure will
be harmful, however, so pressure suits are advisable
except in extreme emergencies. Life is possible
in these conditions but not in forms commonly
encountered on Earth.


Very Thin Atmospheres (Atmosphere 2–3) are
experienced on Earth in places like the top of Mount
Everest, where pressure is about a third of an
Atmosphere. This is enough to support respiration for
a period but not indefinitely. Effects such as nausea,
disorientation and dizziness become gradually worse
until the subject becomes incapable of functioning
coherently. It is possible that creatures could develop
which are adapted to these conditions.


Thin Atmospheres (Atmosphere 4–5) can be
tolerated indefinitely by humans who have become
acclimatised but those who are not used to the thin air
may be prone to altitude sickness, which can cause
confusion, headaches and nausea. Even individuals
not affected by altitude sickness will tire quickly and not
rest well until they become used to the conditions. The
equivalent on Earth is encountered at altitudes from
about 2,000 to 4,000 metres, in pressures of around
two-thirds of an Atmosphere.


Standard Atmospheres (Atmosphere 6–7) are
roughly comparable with that found on Earth at sea
level, to within a third greater or less pressure. This
is optimal for the comfort and well-being of most
[[Terra|Terran]] humans, although those adapted to different
environments may be uncomfortable.


Dense Atmospheres (Atmosphere 8–9) with a
pressure up to 2 Atmospheres can be uncomfortable
for normal humans but are breathable. The combination
of dense atmosphere and high humidity produces a
sensation rather like drowning.


Extremely Dense Atmospheres (Atmosphere 10–13)
of greater than 2 atmospheres pressure can be coped
with for short periods with careful compression and
decompression, and a suitable air supply (in the
manner used by divers), but without careful pressure
adjustment and support equipment humans cannot
survive in this environment.


Superdense Atmospheres such as those found on
Venus or gas giant planets are totally unbreathable to
humans, no matter what their gas composition may
be. The pressure may cause physical damage long
before breathing becomes an issue. A superdense
atmosphere would normally be assigned a code of 15 –
unusual – (if they were given one at all) as they lie well
beyond the normal range.

BREATHING DIFFICULTIES
Most creatures can withstand a degree of imbalance
between their internal pressure and conditions
outside but major changes of pressure, especially
sudden ones, can cause severe harm. Physical
effects such as tissue damage require very low
pressure but a Traveller may encounter respiratory
difficulties long before pressure becomes low enough
to cause direct harm.

Low pressure reduces the availability of oxygen,
which can have rapid and obvious effects or be
more insidious. Those who are acclimatised to lower
pressures can function normally, although there is a limit
to how little oxygen a Traveller can get by on. Those
not acclimatised will often display symptoms of altitude
sickness or in more serious cases be distressed and
unable to process enough oxygen. Starships normally
alter their internal conditions slowly whilst in jump,
allowing passengers to arrive already acclimatised.

One way to deal with the problem of lacking enough
air is to use a compressor system or air supply. Most
forms of armour do not include an air supply and are
therefore no use against respiratory hazards, but
some military systems do incorporate emergency
breathing equipment.

Many breathing systems are simply a mask with
either bottled air or means of obtaining a breathable
gas mix from the outside environment. Examples
include compressor masks, which draw in the outside
air and compress it sufficiently that the user can
breathe easily. Filter systems, or combination filter/
compression systems, are necessary when the
outside air contains a harmful substance. An artificial
gill preforms a similar function in water, drawing in
oxygen and storing it for use.


Filter or compressor based units are little use when
immersed in liquid but most bottled-air systems will
allow breathing in any environment that does not require
a sealed suit. A simple face mask is sufficient where
air pressure is very low or the Traveller is operating
in a gas mix that is not harmful but which they cannot
breathe. In extremely low pressure environments or
vacuum, a sealed pressure suit is needed to protect
against the environment – humans need a certain gas
or liquid pressure around them to function properly. For
very low pressure and vacuum environments, a sealed
suit is required. A vacc suit or similar garment maintains
pressure around the body as well as providing air.


Assuming there is sufficient atmospheric pressure to
avoid other problems, a Traveller can hold their breath
for a number of combat rounds equal to their END
under conditions of moderate activity. This includes
walking briskly, struggling to open the emergency
breathing gear locker or swimming underwater.


Heavy activity such as fighting or running uses up air
much faster. Roll D3 for every round of such activity;
this is how many rounds’ worth of normal activity have
been used up. A Traveller undertaking very light activity
such as moving slowly and carefully, or who is keeping
still trying to conserve oxygen, will double the time
before they need to breathe.


Once this time is exceeded, the Traveller must make
an Athletics (endurance) check each round to continue
holding their breath. Difficulty starts at Simple and
increases one level every other round until it reaches
Formidable. Sooner or later this roll will be failed but it
is possible to hold one’s breath for a long time at need.


Once the roll is failed, the Traveller must breathe in.
This may mean taking in a lungful of smoke, water or
toxic gas mix, or trying to breathe something that will
not support respiration but causes no direct harm. If
the Traveller breathes in something harmful mixed
with breathable air, the effects will depend upon the
substance breathed in. Neutral gases, water and the
like do not cause harm as such; they simply do not
provide any oxygen. This will kill the Traveller in a
short time. Each round they are unable to breathe,
they suffer 1D damage.


65

###### ATMOSPHERE AND VACUUM


TRAVELLER


In the case of breathing harmful substances alongside
useful air, the Traveller will not immediately begin to
suffocate but will still take damage. Some chemicals
or substances will have additional effects, depending
on their nature. For example, a cloud of spores
might cause problems breathing and also have a
hallucinogenic effect. This is dealt with under the
chemicals and diseases rules on page 71.


DECOMPRESSION
Decompression occurs when a vacc suit or
spacecraft compartment loses its ability to contain
air, or when air is deliberately removed from a
compartment. This will expose Travellers to vacuum
or very low pressures, and may also have secondary
effects such as objects being flung around by the
rush of escaping atmosphere.


Explosive Decompression takes place when a
pressurised suit or space craft is suddenly and
seriously holed, or a hull section fails. Internal pressure
will quickly push out all the air, along with anything else
that is not properly secured.


When a compartment explosively decompresses,
the occupants will be flung around (this does not
apply to suits that are suddenly holed). Everyone
within the compartment must pass an Average
(8+) Vacc Suit or Athletics (dexterity) check to grab
something and secure themselves, or they will be
propelled towards the breach. If they are fortunate,
these Travellers will strike something on the way.
This inflicts 2D damage but gives the Traveller an
extra chance to grab hold of something.


Assuming the breach is not so huge that there is
no chance to impact an intact part of the wall or
bulkhead, Travellers have a final chance to avoid
going straight out of the hole. Another Athletics or
Vacc Suit check can be made and, if passed, the
Traveller snags on wreckage or impacts an intact
section of bulkhead. This causes an additional 3D
damage. Those who are unlucky go straight out of the
breach into open space, possible ripping themselves
to pieces on jagged edges in the process.


In the round that a catastrophic suit breach occurs
or a compartment is holed, explosive decompression
takes place as noted above. The following round the
compartment is in a state of a Partial Vacuum and all
Travellers will be harmed accordingly. The round after
that it will be a complete (hard) vacuum and will remain
so until sealed and re-pressurised.


Round 0: Explosive Decompression effects
Round 1: Partial Vacuum
Round 2+: Hard Vacuum


See page 66-67 for the effects of partial and hard
vacuum exposure.


Rapid Decompression is not quite so serious. It
occurs when a minor breach is made and air begins to
escape. Although there will be discomfort and possibly
damage to eardrums and the like from rapidly dropping
pressure, any Travellers in the breached compartment
have a little time to self-rescue. Small objects may be
flung towards the breach but the escape of air will not
be fast enough to endanger humans.


Rapid decompression takes place over several combat
rounds. In the round the compartment is holed, the
situation is apparent but occupants take no immediate
damage. The Referee should secretly roll D3. This is
the number of rounds for the atmospheric pressure to
fall to dangerous levels. After these rounds a minimal
atmosphere exists in the compartment. The Referee
should then roll another D3. This is the number of
rounds until pressure can be considered a partial
vacuum. D3 rounds after that, all the air is gone and
occupants are exposed to hard vacuum.


See below for the effects of minimal atmospheres,
partial and hard vacuum:
Round 0: No harmful effects but decompression
becomes noticeable.
Stage 1: Roll D3. Atmospheric conditions can be
considered normal for this many rounds.
Stage 2: Roll D3. Minimal pressure conditions exist for
this many rounds.
Stage 3: Roll D3. Partial Vacuum conditions exist for
this many rounds.
Stage 4: Hard Vacuum now exists.

###### ATMOSPHERE AND VACUUM


VACUUM EXPOSURE AND

EXTREMELY LOW PRESSURE

The following effects assume a Traveller is totally
exposed, i.e. wearing nothing more protective than
normal clothing. Breathing equipment is not relevant
here – low pressure causes damage by exposure
whether or not the Traveller has enough air to breathe.
Protection requires a sealed pressurised suit. Correctly
speaking, low pressure and vacuum exposure should
be combined with hypoxia/suffocation effects but a
vacuum-exposed Traveller is in enough trouble already.

Minimal Pressures can be tolerated (at great
discomfort) for a Traveller’s END in minutes providing
they have air to breathe, e.g. from an emergency mask
and bottle. If they have not, they will die of hypoxia long
before the lack of air pressure harms them. However,
in the case where a Traveller is, say, trying to cross a
low-pressure compartment wearing just a firefighter’s
air supply (i.e. they have bottled air but no pressure
suit) they will be uncomfortable but unharmed for the
period above. After this, END is reduced by 1 point per
minute. Unconsciousness occurs when END reaches 0,
at which point damage is taken alternately by STR and
DEX until the Traveller dies.

Partial Vacuum cannot be tolerated by unprotected
humans for long, whether they have an air supply or
not. The fact that there is a little air pressure enables
the Traveller to survive a while longer but not much.
A Traveller who is exposed to partial vacuum suffers
1D damage per round, with unconsciousness and
death occurring as above.

Hard Vacuum is even more dangerous. Travellers
exposed to hard vacuum suffers a cumulative 1D
damage each round, suffering 1D damage the first
round, 2D the second and so on. A typical person will
be unconscious in one to three combat rounds (about
6–18 seconds) and dead soon afterwards.

PARTIAL EXPOSURE AND


SUIT BREACHES
The previous effects assume a Traveller in their
shirtsleeves, exposed to the hazard. However, partial
protection is possible. A Traveller in a sealed vacc suit
is completely safe but if their suit becomes damaged
they may be partially exposed. A minor suit breach
such as a gunshot wound (or several) allows the suit to
continue providing some protection. A major suit breach
such as a rip caused by jagged debris or knife slash
allows the suit to offer a minimal level of protection. In
some cases, a suit may have a minor malfunction and
cause a body part to be slightly exposed. This is not
very serious except over long periods.


A breached vacc suit will cause exposure to vacuum
with the effects described previously. Most suits have
a measure of self-sealing capacity and the internal
pressure of the Traveller’s body will often push their
flesh against a small breach and partially seal it, so that
only the local area is exposed.


To cause explosive decompression from a vacc
suit, it would be necessary to shred it, shatter the
helmet or at least rip it right open, very suddenly.
Most of the ways this might happen would render
decompression effects academic.


Less severe suit breaches are possible without
killing the suit’s occupant, or at least leaving enough
of them to suffer decompression effects. Rapid
decompression is possible if a helmet or limb seal failed
catastrophically, or the faceplate shatters. In this case,
the suit would still offer some protection if it covers at
least part of the wearer. Otherwise, the Traveller will
usually still be able to breathe as air leaks out. They
will be partially exposed to vacuum but able to continue
functioning, perhaps conducting a self-rescue.

an adventure but it does limit what the Travellers can
do in such an environment. Less extreme situations
are unlikely to be immediately harmful and may be
encountered in the course of a game.


High-pressure atmospheres can make it difficult to
breathe and have a tendency to force their way into
suits and vehicles through seals that would keep
atmosphere inside against a vacuum. This is why
spacecraft do not make good submarines – keeping
air pressure in against a vacuum means operating
at a differential of one Atmosphere (i.e. the mean
pressure of Earth’s atmosphere at sea level),
whereas even just a few tens of metres down, water
pressure on the hull of a submerged vessel (and
all of its weak points) can be many times as much.
Extreme pressure can flatten a hull but seals will
normally fail long before this occurs.


On a world with normal gravity, water pressure
increases by one Atmosphere for every 10 metres
below the surface. Gas pressure increases much
more slowly with depth; for a standard atmosphere
world with gravity equivalent to that of earth, the
pressure at a depth of 10 kilometres below the surface
is around 2.9 atmospheres. At 50 kilometres, where
the earth’s crust meets the mantle, pressure would be
52 Atmospheres. At 100 kilometres, pressure would
be around 500 Atmospheres.


By way of comparison, atmospheric pressure at ‘sea
level’ (if such a thing existed) on a gas giant planet such
as Jupiter is estimated at around 990 Atmospheres.


Modestly high pressures are not directly harmful to
people but can cause secondary issues. A fluid depth of
30 metres exerts just 3 Atmospheres of pressure (plus
one for normal air pressure) but this is enough that
divers breathing bottled air risk nitrogen narcosis. This
produces an effect somewhat like drunkenness due to
the narcotic and anaesthetic effect of many gases at
high pressure. Nitrogen is the most common problem
since it makes up most of a standard air mix.


At a depth of 60 metres underwater, with about 7
Atmospheres of pressure on a diver, there is an
increasing risk of oxygen toxicity; the result of the body
retaining too much oxygen. A normal air mix at high
pressure will produce this effect, so those operating
under high pressures require a lower partial pressure
of oxygen. Similar effects can be encountered when
breathing very high concentrations of oxygen under
normal pressures – which means that high-oxygen
atmospheres can actually be unsafe for humans to
breathe as well as posing a serious fire hazard.


As a rule, a shattered faceplate, major failed seal,
or a suit torn open by debris or a blade weapon will
allow the Traveller to continue to function – or, at least,
remain conscious and suffer as they die of vacuum
exposure. A smaller breach such as a minor seal
failure or gunshot wound will allow air to escape rapidly
from the suit but it will continue to provide sufficient
protection that the Traveller will remain conscious and
be able to act, so may well be able to self-rescue.


A Minor Suit Breach exposes the wearer to outside
conditions but reduces damage by 4 points per
dice (i.e. hard vacuum causes a cumulative 2D-8
damage per round).


A Major Suit Breach exposes the wearer to outside
conditions but reduces damage by 2 points per
dice (i.e. hard vacuum causes a cumulative 2D-4
damage per round).


Slight Exposure caused by a minor suit malfunction
such as a faulty glove seal causes minor localised
effects. The Traveller takes one point of damage after
his END in minutes, repeated at the same interval.


A Minor Breach in a vacc suit occurs when there is a
short tear, failed seam or puncture wound resulting
from a gunshot or similar occurrence. A Major Breach
occurs when a suit’s faceplate is shattered or the suit
has a significant hole in it such as that caused by a
slashing weapon doing six or more points of damage
above the suit’s Protection.


HIGH PRESSURE
High pressure can also be a problem, although
it is more likely to be a plot element or additional
complication than a direct hazard. After operating in
a very high pressure environment, Travellers have to
undergo careful decompression which can take several
hours. This is not the stuff of exciting adventures in
the far future. Thus deep water and extremely dense
atmospheres are normally tackled in a manner that
protects the Travellers from them, such as deep-diving
suits, submarines or special exploration starships.


Extreme environments like this are an all-or-nothing
proposition. If the Travellers remain protected, they
are fine. If not, they die almost immediately. This can
be useful for creating threats, tension and barriers in

68

###### ATMOSPHERE AND VACUUM


It is possible for a human to function well enough
to carry out complex tasks and suffer no ill effects
afterward, when exposed to pressures of at least 50
Atmospheres (500 metres underwater) but this does
require a special gas mix and very cautious movement
into and out of the high pressure region.

Extreme pressures (30–50 Atmospheres) are sufficient
to cause High Pressure Nervous Syndrome (HPNS)
in humans even when breathing a mix composed
mostly of helium, the least toxic of all gases. HPNS is
debilitating and can prevent a diver from functioning
coherently. Thus 50 Atmospheres represents the limit
that humans can tolerate using special gas mixes.

It is possible to go deeper than these depths using a
vehicle or suit whose structure will resist the external
pressure, and even to live on the seabed in cities
designed to withstand the huge pressures encountered
there. Hard suits exist on Earth (TL8-ish) which can


operate at a depth of 700 metres (70 atmospheres)
for several hours without needing to decompress the
user afterward or breathe exotic gas mixes. Small
research submarines have penetrated to the deepest
point of Earth’s oceans (almost 11,000 metres, at 1,100
Atmospheres of pressure) with a human crew aboard.


STARSHIPS UNDER PRESSURE
The average starship does not make a very good
submarine; seals and components designed to keep
one Atmosphere of pressure in are less effective
against 100 in the opposite direction. Typical starships
can withstand 10 Atmospheres of pressure without
structural damage and up to three times that much
before danger of a major structural failure. However,
even at half the ‘safe’ depth of 100 metres (10
Atmospheres) there will be minor leakage and perhaps
damage to electronics or fragile components.


69

###### ATMOSPHERE AND VACUUM


TRAVELLER


Thus the average starship has more than sufficient
margin to skim fuel from a gas giant’s atmosphere but
this is not enough to dive deeper than the upper layers
(to hide from hostile vessels, for example) without
some risk to the vessel.


Ships specifically designed or heavily modified for
high-pressure operations can typically withstand 100
Atmospheres of pressure (about one kilometre of water
depth), which is enough to hide on the bed of a shallow
sea. Three times as much pressure could be tolerated
with increasingly rapid leakage and danger of serious
structural failure, which could cause a cascading hull
collapse. It might be possible to build a starship for
extreme pressure operations, for example to dive to the
bottom of a gas giant’s atmosphere, but this would be
inefficient and extremely expensive.


Getting water out of a spacecraft can be a challenge
unless it has been adapted for the task. The vessel’s
internal life support systems are not likely to be set
up for removing loose water but a clever crew might
be able to rig additional hoses to make use of the
ship’s existing systems.


It is possible to undertake a set of modifications,
readying a starship for underwater operations. This
has the effect of tripling the tolerable depths and
adding pumps to remove leaked water and usually
includes the addition of an underwater manoeuvring
system. A modified ship is thus capable of operating at
a ‘safe’ depth of up to 300 metres and with some risk
down to about 900 metres.


By way of comparison, the continental shelves on Earth
are mostly less than 150 metres beneath the surface,
with an average depth of 60 metres, thus having a
pressure of about 6–15 Atmospheres. A standard
starship could sit on the bottom more or less indefinitely
but might suffer some leaks. A modified one could be
based there, or operate directly out of a seabed city.


Average ocean depth on Earth is about 3,700 metres,
giving a pressure of about 370 Atmospheres. This is
too much for even a hardened spacecraft to tolerate but
the seabed is not flat. A ship could probably locate a
seamount or ridge to lie upon. Exploring the very deep


oceans in a starship is not feasible, unless one were
specially developed to handle immense pressures; a
better alternative might be to use a submerged starship
as a base for deep-diving submersibles or robotic craft.


UNDERWATER ENVIRONMENTS
Water and other dense fluid mediums create a difficult
environment for combat and other operations. The
problem of breathing must of course be solved and
in addition water resistance makes many actions
impossible. Most conventional firearms will work
underwater but a projectile loses energy very quickly in
a dense medium. Some weapons, such as spearguns
and specialist firearms, are reasonably effective
underwater but ranges are still short.


Plasma weapons and similar devices pose a severe
threat to the user and anyone within a radius of three
metres. Firing any plasma weapon underwater causes
an explosion of superheated vapour that causes half
the weapon’s normal damage to the user and those
close by and an almighty bubble of gas heading for the
surface. The weapon is likely to be destroyed, whilst
anyone more than three metres away will not be greatly
harmed. The typical plasma gun is a 1DD weapon, i.e.
damage is usually rolled on one dice multiplied by 10.
In this case, a plasma gun would be treated as doing
10D damage and therefore inflicts 5D on its user.


Lasers suffer an extreme shortening of range; even
those keyed to wavelengths that travel well underwater
are inefficient compared to lasers firing through air or
vacuum. Similarly, most hand weapons are useless as
they cannot gain enough momentum to be effective.
Small sharp blades and stabbing implements retain
their usefulness, however.


When firing any laser or projectile weapon underwater,
other than one adapted to this environment, range is
reduced to a tenth of normal. Specialised underwater
weapons reduce their range by a fifth instead.


All close combat attacks are subject to DM-4 when
fighting underwater and blunt weapons are useless.
A long sharp blade can still be used to cut or stab but
it is awkward. The Referee may choose to disregard
the penalty if a Traveller is fighting with a specialised
underwater weapon or knife.

## ISEASES,

## TOXINS AND CHEMICALS

The mechanics for dealing with the effects of harmful
substances are very similar, despite their origins being
quite different. We will use the term ‘agent’ as a catch-
all to describe these substances.

Agents can harm the victim in various ways. Some
interfere in the body’s natural processes whilst others
damage specific organs. Some biological agents
actively grow within the body, such as fungal spores,
whilst others cause diseases by viral or bacterial
infection. The details can vary significantly but for the
purposes of Traveller we are primarily interested in how
the agent is introduced to the body, the effects of the
agent, the time between exposure and the beginning of
the effects and whether the effects can be resisted.

It may also be important to know if an agent can
be passed from one person to another. As a rule
of thumb, diseases and biological agents can
often cause one host to infect other people but
non-biological agents generally cannot. There are
exceptions to both, however. The notes on any
specific agent will indicate its capabilities.

Agents can be divided into three basic types:

Biological agents are of natural origin, in that they
are created by life processes even if those processes
have been manipulated to create the agent. Viruses
and bacteria, parasites and biological toxins such as
snake venom all fall into this category, although they
have different capabilities. Most biological agents are
destroyed by heat (and sometimes cold) or radiation

- often including ultraviolet light – and will rapidly
become harmless if supporting life processes are
terminated. For example, a virus living in a person’s
body will usually cease to be dangerous within a few
hours after the death of the host.

Chemical agents are typically inert, i.e. they cannot
reproduce themselves but can usually survive
conditions that would destroy a biological agent. Toxic
chemicals remain toxic unless their nature is changed,
perhaps by reaction with a neutralising agent.


Energy-Based agents cause harm by damaging
living cells. The most obvious example is nuclear
radiation but various exotic forms of energy might exist
in a Traveller universe. Energy-based agents might
harm the victim directly, such as when a Traveller is
exposed to radiation in a solar flare, or might irradiate
an object which is then ingested or comes in contact
with skin. This is why radioactive fallout is dangerous

- radioactive dust can be breathed in or ingested, or
lie in contact with the skin and thus allow its radiation
to cause damage to the victim. Protection against
secondary hazards of this sort requires preventing
contact, perhaps by using a sealed suit and breathing
system. Direct radiation is harder to protect against,
requiring a material that absorbs the energy to be
placed between target and agent.


DELIVERY METHOD
The delivery method of the agent is important, since
avoiding exposure is the surest method of protection.
Some agents cannot affect a victim without getting into
the bloodstream. Skin is an effective barrier against
many such agents, providing it is not broken. Others
need to be ingested or inhaled and in many cases
will not have any effect unless they pass through the
respiratory or digestive system.


Ingested agents are the easiest to defend against.
If not eaten or drunk they cannot affect the victim.
Detection of many chemical agents is fairly easy due
to their odour or other characteristics. Some toxins
cannot be smelled or tasted and require the use of
technological sensors to detect.


Injected agents can be delivered by medical injection
but are more often encountered on the stingers or
fangs of hostile wildlife, or delivered as darts, needles
or bullets by projectile weapons. To have effect,
injected toxins must enter the bloodstream. This
normally requires breaking the skin or contact with
an open wound. Weapons that do no damage (other
than to deliver a chemical payload) will penetrate most
normal clothing but will be stopped by any form of
armour useful against projectiles. A weapon that does
some normal damage will fail to inject its toxin if it is
stopped by armour.


TRAVELLER


Inhaled agents will affect anyone who breathes them
in. They generally take the form of a vapour but can
be a toxic gas, cloud of spores or dust. A Traveller who
is aware of a gas cloud may try to hold their breath
and run clear of it. To do so they must be aware of
the gas and make an immediate Athletics or Survival
check. Difficulty is at the Referee’s discretion and will
be higher if the Traveller must do something strenuous
such as force a heavy door, or if they are hit and take
damage. This check must be made each round the
Traveller is exposed to the airborne agent.


If the Traveller fails the check at any point, or fails to
notice the threat, they breathe in the gas and suffer
whatever effects may apply. A Traveller in a sealed
suit or who is wearing a respirator is immune to the
effects of most gases.


Contact agents may also be dangerous if breathed but
their primary mode of attack is by contact with skin or
mucous membranes such as eyes, throat and so forth.
Contact agents are usually in liquid or gaseous form
but may be spores, dust or even a large object such as
a strange monument made from a toxic metal.


Some creatures (and certain weapons) spray a
noxious chemical at enemies. Such a spray must hit
the target, usually in the face. This requires an attack
roll and is ineffective against Travellers wearing a full-
face helmet or mask, although a coating of liquid can
make it hard to see.


Other gases require only contact with eyes to have
some effect, e.g. tear gas. A Traveller in a sealed suit
is immune but while a respirator will protect against
breathing in the gas and the effects thereof, eye
protection suitable to keep out gases is required. Thus
a respirator mask with integral goggles will protect
the user from tear gas and the equivalent chemical in
liquid spray form, while a visored security helmet will
stop the spray but not gas.


Some powerful chemicals need only be absorbed
through skin contact. A complete suit such as a vacc
suit or battle dress gives protection so long as it is kept
sealed and suitably decontaminated after exposure.
Other protection is marginally effective. Measures such
as covering as much skin as possible with clothing or
donning a breathing mask may be sufficient to reduce
exposure. A Traveller attempting such measures may
achieve partial protection.


A Traveller who is exposed to a skin-contact agent
may try to make an Athletics (dexterity) check to avoid
intoxication (by rushing into clear air). The difficulty
is decreased by one for partial protection as noted
previously and by an additional level if conditions are
not favourable for gas weapons (e.g. a windy day).


Radiant Agents are propagated by electromagnetic
radiation and may be powerful enough to penetrate
protection or intervening solid objects. The only effective
means of defence are barriers (such as protective
clothing or walls) and distance. Radiant agents can
usually be detected by appropriate instruments in time
to avoid moving into the danger area.


If a Traveller is exposed, they may still resist the effects
of the agent.


DETECTION OF AGENTS
Many agents can be detected by simple means.
Gas or spore clouds may be obvious to the naked
eye, although it may not be obvious that a mist or
dust is toxic. However, observation combined with
a knowledge of local conditions is often sufficient to
warn Travellers. If they know local swamps are prone
to clouds of toxic gas and they see a strange mist
over the nearby pond, they should be able to figure
out what is happening.


Other agents are relatively obvious but in other ways.
Many chemical toxins have an appearance or smell
that can give warning before full exposure occurs
and Recon and Survival skills are useful in providing
a warning. However, more subtle toxins may be
difficult to detect. An experienced outdoorsman
may know the signs of local hazards, or rules of
thumb about which plants and animals are safe to
eat. Likewise, those used to working with chemicals
will know that this combined with that produces
something dangerous and will be alert to the
possibility in a way a layman would not.


Figuring out that a toxic or harmful agent may
be present requires a Difficult (10+) Science check
(the speciality or sub-speciality depends upon the
type of agent). Success indicates the Traveller has
realised an agent is likely to be present in the local
environment, although this does not necessarily mean
a specific threat has been spotted.

72

Diseases, Toxins and Chemicals


Spotting a threat requires a Difficult (10+) Recon or
Survival check. The difficulty is reduced to Routine (6+)
if the Traveller has studied the environment or been
informed that an agent may be present – after a couple
of brushes with spore or gas clouds, the Travellers will
become adept at spotting them.

Complex or subtle toxins can usually be detected
using chemical or biological instruments. Diseases,
on the other hand, generally require observation
of symptoms or analysis of samples. Since many
diseases have a period in which they can be
transmitted before they exhibit symptoms, there is a
real danger that an infected Traveller can spread a
disease, especially if they move over a wide area and
come into contact with many people.

EXPOSURE, DELAY AND INTERVAL
When a Traveller is initially exposed to an agent, it
is necessary to determine if they are affected by it.
In some cases the agent takes effect immediately
but often there is a delay before symptoms appear.
This may be due to the growth of spores, damaging
effects of a chemical, incubation of a disease or many
other factors but the effect is the same. In the case of
radiant weapons, the process is slightly different as
the cumulative dose of radiation is what matters. In
such cases the Referee should impose the effects of
exposure when the full dose has been taken, i.e. when
the Traveller has ceased to be exposed. The exception
is where ongoing exposure will produce symptoms
which will warn a Traveller of what is happening and
enable them to prevent further exposure.

A Traveller cannot be affected by an agent if they are
not exposed to it, so someone who maintains vacc suit
protocol whilst in a disease area and undergoes proper
decontamination after leaving runs no risk unless a
critical error has been made.

Once a Traveller has been affected by an agent,
there may be a delay – sometimes quite a long one

- before the first effects appear. This may be the only
set of effects but many agents will produce repeated
effects over time. This is referred to the Interval of the
agent. The affected Traveller usually has a chance
to resist the effects each time they are applied and,
if successful, the agent no longer affects them. The
same process is used for diseases; much of the time
a Traveller’s body will eventually fight off the disease
if it does not kill them in the meantime. Persistent
diseases do exist but even then there is usually a cure
if advanced medical assistance is available.


The Referee might choose to determine if the Trveller
is affected at the time of exposure, or instead make the
determination after the agent’s Delay period, making
the determination at the point where symptoms would
appear. Effects are then applied and after the agent’s
Interval a new determination is made to see if the
Traveller is still affected or has begun to recover.


For agents that may affect the victim more than once,
or over time, the Interval value indicates the time
between incidents. If the victim has a chance to resist
the effects, they may attempt to resist each time the
effect is applied and once an effect is resisted the
Traveller will – in most cases – no longer be affected
and may begin to recover. Occasionally an agent
may continue to attack the Traveller even after being
successfully resisted, such as a poison still present in
the body. In such cases, outside intervention is required
to remove the threat, otherwise it is only a matter of
time before the victim succumbs.


RESISTING AN AGENT
When a Traveller is exposed to any agent, they get
a chance to resist its effects. It may or may not be
obvious that they have failed to resist the agent. For
example, most diseases have an incubation period
before symptoms present themselves and some
chemical agents do not have an immediate effect. A
Traveller might be exposed to chlorine gas and think
they have escaped the effects, only to become ill
several hours later.


All harmful diseases, organisms and chemicals that
do not have a direct physical effect (e.g. acid, which
causes wounds in the normal manner) are rated
according to the difficulty of the END check required
to resist their effects. If the Effect of the check is
positive, the Traveller has not been affected; if it is
negative they have. If the Effect is exactly zero, then
in some cases the Traveller could become a carrier
for the disease or agent, or have a delayed onset of
symptoms. If so, a second attempt to resist the agent
is made when it finally manifests itself.


Remember that a properly protected Traveller cannot
be affected by an agent. For example, someone in a
gas-proof suit cannot be attacked by gas unless the
suit is breached or deliberately unsealed.


73

Diseases, Toxins and Chemicals


TRAVELLER


Damage from harmful substances may occur each
round or at intervals. In some cases, a Traveller may
make an END check to avoid damage on that occasion,
although after the interval has passed another check is
required to avoid the next set of damage.


AGENT EFFECTS
Most agents cause damage to the victim in much
the same way as any other form of attack, although
some have additional or alternative effects. It is
possible to contract a chronic disease that injures
the victim every day, resulting in a Traveller being
able to go adventuring but be more prone to injury
due to a damaged END characteristic. Some agents
directly reduce a characteristic, either permanently
or on a temporary basis.


Temporary damage to a characteristic is regained at
the rate of one point per week if the Traveller is resting
and undertaking only light activity. If they are receiving
proper medical care then their physician can reduce
the time to regain a point by the Effect of an Average
(8+) Medic check. A new Medic check can be made the
following day, potentially allowing very rapid recovery.


Specific effects may have a set period or last until
the agent is countered by medical means. They may
go away when the Traveller successfully resists the
agent’s effects, or may linger afterward. This is dealt
with in the notes on specific agents.

DISEASES AND

BIOLOGICAL HAZARDS

Whilst diseases and biological weapons are treated
much the same as other agents, they can have
additional complications. A poison created by a
biological process is more or less the same as
a poisonous chemical but a biological threat will
typically infect the victim with a disease or disease-like
condition. This requires a longer period to take effect
than a chemical-based agent. Thus whilst a chemical
agent (such as nerve gas) tends to kill instantly or
quickly, a biological agent is more insidious.

A biological threat must get into the body, just as with a
chemical agent. A Traveller in a sealed suit is safe from
airborne diseases unless they open the suit without
decontaminating it first. To determine if a Traveller has
been exposed to a hazard, the same classifications
are used as for chemical attacks – e.g. a blood-borne
disease must be injected; a droplet-based infection is
effectively a gas cloud.

Disease effects are highly variable. Most diseases
cause some kind of fever and flu-like symptoms
within 1–14 days of infection and last a similar period.
Diseases can be rated like lethal toxins in terms of the
ability to resist. How deadly a given disease might be
is a matter for the Referee to decide, although dying of


anthrax or a mutant form of chickenpox is not the stuff
of free-wheeling interstellar adventure. Diseases are
thus better used as a plot device than a way of making
Travellers’ lives miserable.

SAMPLE DISEASES AND


BIOLOGICAL AGENTS
There are plenty of ordinary diseases a Traveller
can catch. The common cold will undoubtedly still
be making people miserable in the far future and
most illnesses are nothing more than a nuisance. A
starship in jump might ring to the sound of sneezing
but it will still get to its destination. Some diseases
are more serious and some can have effects that
might create or complicate an adventure. A truly
devastating disease might influence the course of a
campaign or even define the setting.


The diseases that follow are presented in a standard
format consisting of their name and general nature
followed by the difficulty of the END check required to
resist the illness. This can be modified by the Effect of a
Medic check if proper medical care is available.


Most diseases have one to three stages. At the
beginning of each stage the victim attempts an END
check to resist. If it is made, they begin to recover. If
not, they proceed to the next stage.

Diseases, Toxins and Chemicals


TRAVELLER


ATLANTA HAEMORRHAGIC FEVER
Nature: Blood-borne, natural disease
Difficulty: Formidable (14+)


Stage 1: After an incubation period of 4D+12 hours, the victim begins to display flu-like symptoms. This soon
proceeds to minor ‘bleeds’ both internally and externally.


Stage 2: After 4D hours, the disease proceeds to Stage 2 unless a Formidable (14+) END check is made.
The victim suffers serious internal haemorrhaging resulting in collapse and death. If the check is successful,
the victim will recover over the course of 1D+2 days.


Notes: Haemorrhagic fevers cause a breakdown in the walls of blood vessels and organs. Most are less
than 30% fatal but this very nasty variant is almost always terminal. It can only be passed by contact with
bodily fluids, notably blood. An outbreak of a disease this virulent would normally result in the quarantine
of the entire affected area, creating interesting plot possibilities. A small community such as a backwater
starport could be completely wiped out in between starship visits or, worse, infected individuals might be
taken elsewhere aboard a passing ship.


QUARETE FEVER
Nature: Natural ailment, can be weaponised as a bio-weapon
Difficulty: Average (8+)


Stage 1: After an incubation period of 2D+8 days, the victim begins to display symptoms of fever,
headache and possibly chest pain and coughing. Pneumonia is very common as a secondary effect. END
and STR are both reduced by 1D each, to a minimum of 1. The patient is contagious during stage 1 but
ceases to be once symptoms appear.


Stage 2: After 2+2D days, the patient begins to recover at the rate of one point each of STR and END
per day. This period is halved to 1D+1 days if medical treatment is available. Most patients recover
without long-term effects.


Notes: Quarete fever is very rarely fatal. It does, however, debilitate the victim and make them a carrier.
Stage 1 sufferers have DM-2 applied against any and all tasks undertaken. Quarete Fever is sometimes
used as a non-lethal biowarfare agent because it can debilitate personnel for long periods and is often
mistaken for naturally occurring pneumonia. If weaponised, Quarete Fever can be dispersed as a vapour,
infecting victims in the same way as any other droplet-borne virus.

Diseases, Toxins and Chemicals


**WEAPONISED ANTHRAX**
Nature: Bioweapon (inhaled spores)
**Difficulty:** Very Difficult (12+)

Stage 1: After an incubation period of 1D days, the victim begins to display flu-like symptoms. STR and END
are each reduced by 1D to a minimum of 1.

Stage 2: After D3 days, check to see if the disease progresses to Stage 2. If the END check is made, the
victim begins to recover at the rate of one point of STR or END (determine randomly which) every day of
rest and good medical care. Stage 2 is accompanied by severe respiratory distress. STR and END are each
further reduced by 1D each. If either reaches zero, the patient will die.

Stage 3: After D3 days, the patient must pass a Very Difficult (12+) END check. If it is failed, the patient
dies of respiratory failure. If the check is passed, the patient continues to suffer acute respiratory
distress for 2D days before beginning to recover. STR and END recover at a rate of one point each per
day after the end of Stage 3.

Notes: Anthrax is caused by a naturally occurring bacteria. It can cause skin infections but is most
dangerous when inhaled. To be really dangerous, Anthrax or some similar bacterial agent must be
weaponised, i.e. it must be combined with a delivery system enabling it to enter the victims’ respiratory
system. Other spore-carried respiratory infections are similar, with a greater or lesser fatality rate.

**NEURODART TOXIN**
Nature: Biological poison, ingested or injected
**Difficulty:** Automatic fail injected, Average (8+) if ingested

Stage 1: Almost instantaneously after the toxin enters the bloodstream (this takes 1D minutes if the toxin
is ingested) the victim suffers neurological disruption beginning with tingling sensations and occasional
vomiting. DEX and INT are reduced by 2D each. If either reaches zero, the victim loses consciousness. If
both reach zero the victim will die.

Stage 2: DEX and INT begin to recover at the rate of one point each per hour after exposure.

Notes: Neurodart toxin gets its name from the fact it is often used to coat projectiles from ‘needle’ or ‘dart’
guns which are not designed to cause damage beyond delivering the toxin. Some creatures have the
ability to project similar darts or may secrete a toxin to coat thorns. Neurodart toxins are often derived from
shellfish and the like, and may be ingested in their natural state. If so, it is possible to resist the effects. Direct
injection into the bloodstream cannot be resisted but is not usually fatal – at least, not directly.

SPACER ’FLU
Nature: Common ailment, droplet infection (inhaled)
Difficulty: Average (8+)


Stage 1: After an incubation period of 2D days, the victim begins to display mild flu-like symptoms. STR and
END are each reduced by D3 to a minimum of 1.


Stage 2: After 2D days, check to see if the disease progresses to Stage 2. A Stage 2 patient appears to
have recovered from what might be mistaken for a cold. STR and END return to normal and the Traveller
feels well. Note that this means a Traveller who fails the END check will actually seem to recover.


Stage 3: After 2D days, the disease progresses to Stage 3. There is no END check – a Stage 2 patient
progresses to Stage 3 automatically. Stage 3 is accompanied by the return of acute ’flu symptoms
accompanied by fever, vomiting and headache. The disease is rarely fatal in its own right but STR and END
are each reduced by 2D for the duration of Stage 3, which could kill a weak Traveller. After 2D days of total
misery, the disease runs its course and the patient recovers.


Notes: As people move around and despite the best that medical science can do, there is always a ’flu virus
making the rounds. This one is hugely unpleasant but rarely fatal for people in generally good health.


TILT FEVER
Nature: Common ailment, droplet infection (inhaled)
Difficulty: Routine (6+)


Stage 1: After an incubation period of 1D days, the victim begins to suffer inner-ear problems resulting in a
loss of balance and general inability to stand upright without clinging to something. The victim suffers DM-2
to all actions other than purely mental ones.


Stage 2: After 1D days, check to see of the disease progresses to Stage 2. If so, the Traveller suffers acute
disorientation and hallucinations, reducing DEX, INT, EDU and SOC by 1D each. This stage lasts 1D days
before ending abruptly. There is no third stage.


Notes: Tilt Fever is a droplet-borne infection picked up from other people. It is debilitating and can be highly
dangerous in some occupations as onset is sudden, with no obvious symptoms before Stage 1 manifests
itself. Recovery is complete once the disease progresses through Stage 2. Tilt Fever will prevent a pilot
from operating a vehicle of spacecraft safely, and has been cited as one of the most common reasons for
requiring a replacement at short notice.

ACIDS AND OTHER CORROSIVES
Corrosive substances can come into contact with a
Traveller through being squirted or splashed, or as
a gas cloud. Armour will protect against a corrosive
substance to some extent, although it will be degraded
to uselessness over time.

Weak acids such as those found in the atmospheric
vapour of less lethal hell-worlds cause relatively
little damage providing they are not breathed in. If
a corrosive agent is inhaled, treat the effect as one
level more serious.

Once a Traveller is exposed to an acid (or other
corrosive substance) it will attack each round until it
has neutralised itself by reacting with the Traveller’s
armour or skin. Damage drops by one dice each round
until the acid is consumed. If the acid is attacking
armour, each dice of damage that is resisted destroys
one point of Protection.

This assumes the Traveller is splashed with a small
quantity of the substance or exposed to vapour. If the
victim is immersed or splashed with a large quantity of
the agent, damage is tripled.


If a Traveller is hit again a second time by acid, or
remains within an acid cloud, this new attack begins
at its full value and begins to drop from there. Much as
with Fire attacks, only the most serious corrosion attack
currently ongoing is considered, so remaining within
an acid cloud means the victim is exposed to the full
strength of the agent each round.


Conventional (i.e. non-sealed) armour will protect
against acid splashes at its normal value until dissolved.
Conventional armour is no use against vapour; only a
sealed suit (e.g. a vacc suit) offers protection from skin
contact or breathing corrosive vapour. Armour of this
sort will still be degraded by vapour.


Some hostile-environment suits are treated to resist
acid exposure. Corrosive agents of Typical or lesser
strength will affect them but only over a period of hours.
After 1D hours of exposure, begin checking for suit
failure each hour. Roll 2D: on a 12+ the suit will fail; the
acid then begins to attack the Traveller within. For each
check after the first, the chance increases by +1, i.e.
the chance of failure is 11+ on the second check, 10+
on the third and so on.


Strong and Very Strong acids will attack even acid-
hardened suits more quickly. Roll for suit failure every
10 minutes of exposure.


Type Damage Comments
Mild 1 per round Mildly caustic substance, e.g. cleaning products, mildly acidic
atmospheric vapour
Weak D3 per round Most weak laboratory acids, dilute naturally occurring acids
Typical 1D per round Most naturally occurring corrosive agents in their normal state
Strong 2D per round Concentrated laboratory acids, corrosive vapour found in some hell-
world atmospheres
Very Strong 3D per round Very powerful acids

# S TARVATION AND THIRST

Being hungry and thirsty is not much of a problem
when the Travellers are a few minutes’ walk from their
favourite starport restaurant. However, the need to
locate proper sources of food and water can be a major
driving factor when out in the wilds. Hunger and thirst
are often limiting or ‘pushing’ factors, in the sense that
a particular action may not be possible due to the need
for more supplies than the Travellers can carry, or an
indication that the Travellers need to get moving before
their supplies run out.

These rules are normally an indication of what-is-to-
be-avoided. Occasionally, things may go wrong and
the Travellers might find themselves in a bad situation.
Knowing how long they can survive might suddenly
become very important.

LACK OF PROPER FOOD
A typical human needs about one kilogram of
decent food per day to avoid beginning to starve. It
is possible to survive with no food or minimal food
for a number of days equal to the Traveller’s END
score before any real harm is suffered, providing the
Traveller has sufficient water. During this period of
pre-starvation, the Traveller heals normally and is not
greatly impaired, although they will be in considerable
discomfort and may lack energy.

Assuming the Traveller engages in modest levels
of activity, starvation begins to take effect after the
Traveller’s END score in days. After this, the Traveller
can function for another period equal to twice his END
score in days, during which he does not heal from
injuries and is sufficiently impaired to suffer DM-2 on
any physical actions.

Symptoms of severe starvation appear after this period,
and can lead to death. The highest of the Traveller’s
STR and END is reduced by one each day – determine
randomly if they are equal. When one or the other
reaches zero, the Traveller collapses and cannot take
any further action. Their highest physical attribute (this
is likely to be DEX at this point) is then reduced by one
per day until all three physical attributes reach zero. At
that point the Traveller will die.


Recovering from starvation depends on at what
stage the Traveller begins to eat properly again. If
the Traveller gains access to sufficient food (i.e. more
than what would be required to prevent starvation)
at any time before they begin to lose points from
STR and END, each day of eating erases one day of
starvation. A medically tailored diet or consumption of
high-quality foods increases this to two or even three
days. So, a Traveller who has had no food for 11 days
might stuff themselves with high-protein foods upon
their return to civilisation. After two days of this, they
have erased four days from their ‘starvation clock’
but have not rebuilt their body’s reserves. If the food
supply is cut off, they are treated as already having
suffered seven days of starvation.


It is possible to eke out a Traveller’s supplies, for
example by eating just enough food one day and
starving the next but this does not ‘reset the clock’

- the only way to do that is to rebuild the Traveller’s
reserves by eating a good diet for a number of days
equal to the time the Traveller was on the brink of
starvation. Days when the Traveller is able to eat
enough do not rebuild their reserves but do prevent
things from getting any worse.


If a Traveller has suffered a reduction to STR, DEX or
END due to starvation, the effects will be very visible
and reversing them requires a lengthy process. One
point is recovered to each damaged characteristic per
week of good diet. This period can be reduced by the
Effect of a Difficult (10+) Medic check.


A typical person (physical characteristics of 7, 7 and
7) can last 7 days without ill effects, 14 more with
moderate ill effects and then begins to deteriorate.
They will collapse after 13 more days, then linger
in semi-conscious misery for eight more. Time from
beginning to end is 42 days. This may seem like a long
time but real-world incidents produce similar results.


WATER SHORTAGE
Under fairly normal conditions, a typical human needs
about three litres of water each day. Hot conditions
increase this amount by a factor of two to three. If
adequate water is not available, a Traveller can survive
36 hours without suffering serious ill effects. After this
they must make an Average (8+) END check every
three hours or suffer a reduction of -1 END. For every
check after the first, then a cumulative DM-1 applies.
The difficulty is reduced to Routine (6+) if some (but
not enough) water is available and increased to Difficult
(10+) in hot or dusty conditions, such as a desert.

Once END has reached 0, the Traveller collapses.
He loses D3 points from the higher of STR or DEX
(randomly chosen if they are identical) per hour until
those, too, reach zero and they die.

For example, Ed the Explorer is lost in the wilderness
with starvation rations for five days. He has END
9 so can go for nine days without food without
suffering serious ill effects (he will be pretty miserable
however) and 18 more days with DM-2 to all physical
activities and no natural healing. After 27 days, he
will begin to suffer serious effects. Ed loses one point
to the higher of STR or END each day. This is not
damage in the physical sense; it is the deterioration of
his body’s capabilities as it tries to survive by feeding
on itself. If either STR or DEX get to zero he will
collapse and be unable to take any significant action
as his body uses up its last reserves.


If Ed has brought five days’ worth of rations with him,
he can use them at any point in this process. He
can alternate days where he eats and days where
he does not, eat all his rations then tough it out, or
suffer for several days before eating anything, eat
for five and then begin to starve again. The effect is
the same – minimal rations are not enough to reset
his ‘starvation clock’.


If Ed was rescued after 14 days (i.e. he ate his rations
but was found just before true starvation set in) and
was properly fed for two days before becoming lost
again, he would be able to survive only two days
before starvation sets in once more – his reserves are
not yet rebuilt. What he needs is a couple of weeks
in a nice hotel with a cooked breakfast every day and
unlimited access to the buffet.


If Ed were not rescued at all, he would be able to
operate reasonably well for 21 days and then could
stumble around the wilderness for a few more days
after starvation set in, eating the odd beetle and leaf
but gradually becoming weaker and weaker. Once
STR or END reached 0, he would be unable to move
and become even weaker each day until his body just
gave up from lack of food.

###### Starvation and Thirst


# E FFECTS OF TEMPERATURE

Injury from extremes of temperature tends to be
localised, such as when a Traveller burns a hand or is
splashed with cryogenic fluids. Such injuries are treated
like weapon damage. Armour and/or insulation can help
and it is up to the Referee to decide whether armour
is of any use. A Traveller using heatproof gauntlets
to handle a hot object should be able to count their
Protection against it.

However, if a Traveller is immersed in the source of the
damage (this is what Fire weapons are designed to do),
then it is much harder to protect against harm. Armour
does not work well against such attacks. Most body
armour is reasonably fireproof but counts at only half
Protection against Fire attacks and cryogenic fluids.

Natural resilience and armour from, say, a
creature’s thick hide, counts as full Protection,
as does a sealed full-body suit like a vacc suit.
Naturally, armour specifically intended to protect
against such attacks, such as a fireproof suit or
Reflec, defends at full Protection.


LONG-TERM EFFECTS
The comfortable range of temperatures for humans
who do not have protective equipment is not great. It
is possible to tolerate quite extreme temperatures (e.g.
inside a meat locker or near a furnace) for a short time
in shirtsleeves without ill effect but temperature can be
insidious and within a fairly short period the Traveller
will begin to suffer harm.


Note that a Traveller wearing an environmentally-
controlled suit is not exposed to outside temperature
and will be immune from all effects so long as the
suit continues to function. Extremes of temperature
will drain power fast and may overload the suit
beyond what it can handle.


HYPOTHERMIA
A Traveller dumped in the arctic in his shirtsleeves has
minutes to live at best and fairly unpleasant ones at
that. However, with suitable clothing, plenty of high-
calorie food and care not to get wet, it is possible for a
human to cope with very low temperatures.


A Traveller exposed to cold conditions with inadequate
protection will gradually begin to suffer from
hypothermia and related effects such as frostbite. How
long this takes depends on the temperature. The effects
are much the same – hypothermia is hypothermia
whether it is caused by sitting in shirtsleeves in a
cold room or trudging through arctic wastelands with
inadequate clothing. Cold severe enough to cause
immediate injury is treated as any other form of
damage; these rules cover situations where a Traveller
is being slowly chilled to death.


Hypothermia is held at bay by making successful END
checks. If successful, the Traveller does not suffer
from ill effects until the next time a check is required.
Difficulty of the check depends upon temperature and
the interval between checks is also determined by the
conditions. On a failed check, END is reduced by -1
and this new value is used for subsequent checks.
If END reaches zero the Traveller begins to suffer
from acute hypothermia and loses D3 points from the
highest of STR or DEX until both reach zero.

**Temperature Damage**


Example Damage
Small flame, e.g. lighter 1 per round
Moderate flame, e.g. wood fire 1D per round
Small intense flame, e.g. blowtorch 2D per round
Steam or burning building 1D per round
Jet of live steam or Furnace 3D
Molten metal or rock 6D
Liquid carbon dioxide 1D per round
Liquid nitrogen 2D per round
Liquid hydrogen 3D per round

This assumes brief contact, such as a gobbet of lava
spitting at a nearby geologist or an unwary engineer
sticking his hand into a jet of live steam from a cracked
pipe. If a Traveller is immersed in the threat, damage
dice are tripled before any reduction for armour
Protection is considered.


Reduced END is regained at the rate of D3 points per
hour spent in a warm place, unless it reached zero as a
result of hypothermia. In this case, the Traveller needs
medical care and regains one point to each reduced
characteristic per day of rest.

Travellers wearing basic cold-environment protection
treat the conditions as one category less serious.
Travellers wearing excellent arctic clothing treat the
conditions as two categories less serious.


HEATSTROKE
Heat concentrated enough to cause immediate physical
injury is dealt with as normal damage. However, when
a Traveller is operating in a hot environment for a
protracted period they may suffer from the effects of
heatstroke. This is modelled much like hypothermia,
with a reduction in END. Protective equipment such as
reflective clothing works well against radiant heat, such
as that coming directly from the sun or an open furnace
door but is less use against heat absorbed from hot air
or water surrounding the Traveller.


Travellers operating in an environment up to a little
above body temperature may be uncomfortable and
require more to drink but will otherwise suffer no ill
effects. Higher temperatures are a problem. Travellers
wearing basic protection (e.g. loose light-coloured
clothing and a hat in the desert) treat conditions as one
level less severe, while those with excellent protection
(e.g. a reflective anti-heat suit) treat the conditions as
two levels less severe.

Over 81ºC 1 minute Cannot be
tolerated


Each time an END check is failed, END is reduced
by -1. Once it reaches zero, the Traveller becomes
badly disorientated and collapses soon after. The
higher of STR or DEX is then reduced by one point
at the indicated interval (randomly chosen if they are
identical). If both reach zero, the victim will die.


Recovery from heatstroke requires a cool environment,
rest and plenty to drink. Reduced END is regained
at the rate of D3 points per hour spent in tolerable
temperatures, unless it reached zero. In this case the
Traveller needs medical care and regains one point to
each reduced characteristic per day of rest.

###### Effects of Temperature


# T

## ERRAIN,

## CONDITIONS, AND MOVEMENT

Terrain can be more than an impediment to movement.
It can be hazardous in a variety of ways, albeit most of
which are passive in nature. Terrain can also conceal
dangers and multiple hazards can co-exist. It is
possible to encounter an aquatic arctic region with an
atmospheric hazard, all of which adds up to significant
difficulty for anyone living or working there. Terrain and
local conditions can also affect speed of movement,
even for grav vehicles. A mountain range is not much
of an obstacle for an air/raft flying high above it but a
g-carrier threading a path between the peaks and along
valleys will have to slow down or risk a disaster.

The movement speeds given in this chapter are a
guideline only. As a rule, a person can walk about one
kilometre in 10 minutes, or six kilometres in an hour, in
easy terrain. A speed of about 35 kilometres per day
is possible when marching or hiking in a disciplined
fashion whilst carrying a load such as an infantryman’s
equipment or camping gear. Difficult terrain will greatly
reduce these distances in addition to increasing the
risk of mishap. Some terrain can only be crossed with
technological assistance or extensive preparation,
although in many cases a Traveller might cope for a
short while; it is possible to make a quick dash between
a building and a vehicle in arctic conditions that would
kill someone trying to hike a few kilometres. It may
be possible to swim, scramble or otherwise proceed
through terrain impenetrable over longer distances. Any
such short-range endeavour is a risk of course but this
is what adventures are made of.

**VEHICLES IN HAZARDOUS TERRAIN**
Any vehicle or conveyance that makes contact with
terrain may be slowed or endangered by it. This applies
also to vehicles passing so close to the ground as to be
affected by ground features. Thus an air/raft threading
its way between bushes and trees is slowed as much
as a wheeled vehicle.

Listed speeds for ground vehicles and watercraft
assume good conditions – flat ground, calm water or
perhaps a road. A vehicle with off-road capability can
travel at its road speed on any reasonably flat, firm
surface. Rougher terrain will slow the vehicle and/or


endanger it if it tries to go faster. A vehicle without off-
road capability, such as a normal ground car, is limited
to 25% of its normal road speed at the absolute best,
except on the flattest and firmest of terrain. ‘Indoor’
vehicles such as starport baggage trolleys might be
able to manage 10% of road speed at most but will be
stopped or damaged by the slightest obstruction. These
speeds are subject to further reduction by terrain.


For example, a normal ground car has a normal Speed
Band of Medium (100–200 kilometres per hour). It
is limited to 25% of its road speed when driving on
reasonably flat grassy fields, i.e. 25–50 kilometres per
hour. This is still quite a high speed for an unmodified
car to be going cross-country and may not be
advisable. When struggling through tougher terrain
that limits speed to 50%, this reduction is applied to
the already reduced speed, dragging top speed down
to just 12–25 kilometres per hour. It might be quicker
to walk, especially if there is a danger of the vehicle
becoming stuck or suffering a disaster.


Hazardous terrain imposes two effects upon vehicles.
The first is a reduction in speed. A vehicle that is forced
to crash through scrubby bushes or labour through
heavy seas will be slowed no matter how hard the crew
tries to go faster. Hazardous terrain also imposes a
risk of mishap or disaster. At the Referee’s discretion,
some vehicles may not be slowed as much as others, if
at all. A submarine running deep will not be affected by
surface chop; a motorcycle may be able to slip between
bushes that would slow down an ATV.


TERRAIN ADAPTATION
Vehicles well adapted to the terrain will not be affected
as badly by hazards, although they can still encounter
conditions that slow or endanger them. A vehicle that
has good adaptations suited to the terrain – such as
an ATV with an additional aquatic drive negotiating a
swamp – halves the normal movement penalty and, in
the event of mishap, allows the driver a chance to avoid
it using his appropriate vehicle skill.


#### CONDITIONS, AND MOVEMENT


The normal difficulty to avoid a mishap is an Average
(8+) check for a vehicle with a suitable adaptation.
The difficulty might be increased for a particularly
hazardous area, or reduced for a vehicle with very
good terrain-handling characteristics such as two or
more applicable adaptations.


VEHICULAR MISHAPS
If circumstances indicate a mishap has occurred, the
Vehicle Mishaps table can be used to determine its
nature. The Referee is encouraged to flesh out possible
hazards for specific environments, using the table as
a starting point. Roll 2D and add the vehicle’s Speed
Band, then subtract the driver’s skill level.


FLYING IN CLUTTERED AIRSPACE
Grav vehicles and aircraft flying above terrain hazards
can ignore them and are subject only to wind and
weather effects. Flying at an altitude where terrain can
pose a hazard, such as between buildings or along
a valley, does not reduce speed but requires care.
Navigating lightly cluttered airspace (a few mountain
peaks or very tall buildings) requires a Routine (6+)
Flyer check every 4D minutes. Cluttered airspace
such as a heavily forested valley with crags requires
an Average (8+) Flyer check every 2D minutes.
These checks are subject to a negative DM equal
to the vehicle’s Speed Band (see the Traveller Core
Rulebook, page 130).


A vehicle with collision-avoidance equipment (an
Enhanced or Advanced Autopilot will have this) can
be relied upon to get the Travellers safely through
the hazardous area at one Speed Band less than
its cruising speed. If the Travellers wish to inflict a
hair-raising and violent passage on themselves the
automatics will keep them alive at cruising speed but
the experience will not be pleasant and anyone who is
not properly strapped into a seat risks being bashed off
the interior fittings every couple of minutes.


Vehicle Mishaps
2D Hazard
4 or less Scary near-miss, passengers and crew
are shaken but no serious harm is done.
5–6 Control loss leads to the vehicle suffering
cosmetic damage and becoming stuck.
Extricating it will take 2D person-hours
(i.e. the result of a 2D roll divided by the
number of people working).
7–8 Minor component failure – broken lights
or windows, damaged tyre, or failed
engine component. The problem can be
fixed or jury-rigged with the vehicle’s own
tools and spares. Make an Average (8+)
Mechanic check each hour to complete a
workable repair.
9–10 Navigational difficulties put the vehicle in
a place where there is no way forward.
Backtracking around the obstruction will
take 1D hours.
11–12 Serious control loss results in a collision
and 1D damage to everyone aboard. The
vehicle is stuck as per 5–6 and suffers a
component failure as per 7–8.
13 or
more


The vehicle crashes and is immobilised,
at least temporarily. It may or may
not be repairable locally. Everyone
aboard suffers 2D damage and several
components are put out of action.


Airborne Hazards
2D Hazard
6 or less Urgent evasive manoeuvre required.
Unpleasant for everyone aboard but no
serious hazard.
7–11 Minor collision with flying creature, tree
branch or similar object. A Routine (6+)
skill check is required to maintain control.
12–14 Collision with a branch, rock, creature
or antenna. 1D damage is applied to the
vehicle and an Average (8+) skill check
required to maintain control.
15 or more Collision results in heavy damage
to vehicle requiring an immediate
emergency landing. In addition, a
Difficult (10+) skill check is required to
maintain control.


85

Terrain, Conditions and movement


TRAVELLER


At higher speeds, skill checks are required as
previously described. Failure indicates a hazard has
been encountered, although immediate corrective
action may be taken in some cases. Roll 2D on the
Airborne Hazards table and add the vehicle’s Speed
Band, then subtract the driver’s skill level. DM-2 applies
in lightly cluttered airspace.


If control is lost, the vehicle will go out of control and
crash. A skilled pilot might mitigate the crash but it
cannot be avoided at this point. Rather than wiping out
all the Travellers on a random failed skill check, the
Referee can impose what might be termed a ‘setback
crash’ which grounds the vehicle until repairs can be
made and imposes difficulties on the Travellers. These
can be quite serious; having to yomp 200 kilometres
back to the starport with little food might be an
adventure in its own right. Then there is the problem of
recovering the vehicle and repairing it, or the cost of a
new one... at least nobody is dead. That is good, right?


USING HAZARDOUS TERRAIN
Hazardous terrain can be used by the Referee to
add an extra dimension to an adventure. This might
be little more than scenery; one climate-controlled
building is much like another but the fact that this
adventure is taking place on the seabed or high up
in cloudy mountains adds interest. In many cases,
hazardous terrain can be used to either make an
adventure more dangerous or contain the Travellers in
a specific area. If it is not possible to survive outside
the world’s only settlement, it is less likely that the
Travellers will decide to ignore the adventure in front
of them and go wandering off.


Hazardous terrain can also be used as a ‘clock’ in an
adventure. An underwater base that is slowly filling up or
an arctic settlement that will be flattened by a storm in a
few hours, will impose a time frame on Travellers. This
can be used for obvious dramatic effect but can also
impose limitations on the activities. Some Travellers will
insist on stripping every saleable thing out of a site they
visit; destroying the place after a few hours prevents this
sort of munchkinistic looting being taken to extremes.


OPEN COUNTRY
Open country is the easiest natural terrain to move
through. Typically, assuming some sort of atmosphere
and availability of water, it will be characterised by light
vegetation with clumps of bushes or trees. Vehicles
without off-road capability are slowed and weather can


severely limit mobility in various ways. There is little
cover in open country and heavy rain or high winds
can cause serious problems. However, open terrain
is rarely entirely flat. This can be beneficial under
some circumstances and an impediment in others. For
example, an area of apparently open grassland might
have low-lying areas that are boggy or contain rain-cut
crevices that can snare a vehicle.


Open grassland is the easiest natural terrain to
move through. Grassland is excellent for cultivation,
so may be replaced in colonised areas by farmed
terrain which may or may not have useable roads.
Grassland will typically contain rolling hills and various
watercourses, along with the occasional lake. The
immediate area around these features may differ from
the rest of the grassland.


Upland areas of grassland are typically termed
moors and generally characterised by hardy, low-
lying vegetation which can conceal hazards and is
surprisingly difficult to push through. Some regions of
open country may be further categorised as steppe,
semi-desert, montane grassland (high altitude
grasslands found in mountainous regions) or tundra.
Characteristics are similar, although specifics of
vegetation and animal life vary.


Walkers and vehicles can typically make their
normal off-road speed in grassland unless there are
additional hazards and are slowed by 50% in rougher
terrain such as moorland.


SHRUBLAND
Shrubland is characterised by bushes and small
trees, often with grassy areas between. Shrubland
differs from open country which has a few bushes
here and there and is extremely dense and difficult
to navigate through. Very thick shrubland may be
all but impenetrable for hundreds of kilometres but
there are usually gaps that can be navigated at half
normal speed. Shrubland offers good concealment to
predators and prey alike, although larger creatures
will tend to be channelled into the passable
areas. This may make encounters more likely and
potentially more hazardous as well.


Shrubland can exist in wet, dry or cold conditions, and
may be combined with rocky terrain as well. If a route
can be found, progress is typically at half normal speed
but those who have to hack their way through dense
areas or crawl through in an ATV, crushing bushes as
they go, will be lucky to make 5–10% of normal speed.

86

Terrain, Conditions and movement


**WETLAND**
Wetland typically occurs in small patches near
watercourses and lakes but extensive wetlands can
be found in low-lying areas. Marshes, swamps and
watery forests are all wetlands, as well as grassland
or shrubland with considerable amounts of free-
standing or flowing water. Wetlands can be totally
impassable to ground vehicles, or navigable with
great difficulty. Movement off the roads or dry areas is
difficult at best and often treacherous. It is hard to tell
if the ‘solid’ ground up ahead is in fact nothing more
than reeds growing in loose mud, and even an ATV
can become stuck in such conditions.

Movement on a good road in wetlands is much the
same as on any other road but navigating tracks and
known paths is slower. It is possible to make 75% of
normal speed on tracks or in a boat. Navigating a wild
wetland is much slower, with Travellers making 25% of
their normal speed at best.

**FOREST AND JUNGLE**
A forest is characterised by large vegetation such as
trees, giant ferns or fungi, and the like. It is generally
not possible to take a large vehicle (anything larger
than a motorcycle) through a forest except on a


cleared or naturally occurring trail. Very dense forest
may be impenetrable without hacking a path – which
may be overgrown and essentially gone in just a few
days. Forests can occur on flat land or hills, which
may create further difficulties.


Forest can include temperate deciduous or evergreen
types, sub-arctic taiga, rainforest or jungle. Wildlife will
vary according to conditions; as a general rule, the
warmer the climate is, the more of a nuisance insects
and other small creatures can be. Some forests teem
with biting or poisonous insects or dangerous parasites,
making them dangerous to pass through.


A light forest can be navigated at half speed on foot or
using agile transportation such as motorcycles, horses
and the like. Dense forest can be navigated at 25%
speed on foot; it is not possible to get far with vehicles
or animals in such terrain. ‘Impenetrable’ forest is not
completely impenetrable as such but requires a path
to be cleared or a Traveller to traverse slowly and
carefully with many delays to go around obstacles or
climb over them. Impenetrable forest can be navigated
at 5–10% of normal movement speed, although some
areas will be truly impassable.


87

Terrain, Conditions and movement


TRAVELLER


ARCTIC TERRAIN
Arctic terrain is characterised by extreme cold but does
not necessarily mean there are ice sheets or snow
banks. A very dry area may not have ice yet pose
the hazards of arctic terrain. Arctic terrain tends to be
exposed to strong winds which can make movement
hazardous or even impossible. Dry, cold terrain of this
sort does not slow movement for vehicles or Travellers
on foot unless there are strong winds.


Movement on an ice shelf can be almost unimpeded
if the ice is very flat. However, it can be very difficult
to spot dips, undulations or bumps amid a landscape
with little contrast. Most such undulations are minor
but can lead to control loss if hit at an awkward
angle whilst driving fast. Traction on ice can also be
a serious problem. If the pressure from a vehicle or
foot is sufficient to cause the surface to melt, this can
create extremely slippery conditions. Low ground
pressure or extremely cold conditions can reduce
this effect. However, the commonest technological
solution is to use studs, spikes or chains to bite into
the ice and improve grip.


A vehicle or Traveller without grip aids risks losing
control on the simplest manoeuvres. A Difficult (10+)
Drive check (Survival if on foot) is necessary to avoid
falling or going out of control at any time a manoeuvre
is attempted at more than 10% of normal speed. With
suitable grip aids it is possible to move on sheet ice at
normal speeds, although any manoeuvre made at more
than 50% of this speed requires an Average (8+) Drive
check to avoid a mishap.


Broken ice is much harder to move safely on. Broken
ice conditions exist where ice has melted and
refrozen or chunks of ice have been moved about.
Rocks and other protrusions are can also create
broken ice conditions. A vehicle that stays under
25% of its normal road speed can travel more or
less safely providing it is using traction aids. Beyond
this, the chances of an incident increase rapidly. An
Average (8+) Drive check is required every hour, with
a negative DM equal to the vehicle’s Speed Band.
Failure indicates a mishap has occurred.


Sub-arctic terrain typically occurs close to permanent
ice sheets but can also be found at high altitudes
in more temperate regions. Often tundra is covered
in snow or ice for much of the year, with vegetation
appearing in an explosion of growth when the


temperature rises. Sub-arctic terrain can also include
taiga; dense forests of evergreen trees or similar
vegetation. The region between taiga and tundra
is characterised by Krummholz; inhospitable areas
where trees can only grow in sheltered spots and tend
to be twisted and deformed by constant wind action.


Taiga is similar to temperate forest in many ways,
other than being very cold and prone to heavy
snow cover. Taiga can typically be navigated at half
speed on foot or using agile transportation such as
motorcycles, horses and the like. Dense taiga can be
navigated at 25% speed on foot; it is not possible to
get far with vehicles or riding animals in such terrain.
Some areas, especially those populated with tough,
springy bushes rather than trees, can be all but
impossible to move through.


Tundra is generally more accessible and may be flat
enough to be considered open plains. However, the
ground is often littered with stones left behind by ice
cover; some of them very large. Tundra can sometimes
be prone to becoming boggy or may be cut with
meltwater channels which can be deep. Tundra can be
crossed at up to 50% of normal speed without undue
hazard. Trying to go faster requires a Routine (6+)
Drive check every 1D hours to avoid a mishap, with a
negative DM equal to the vehicle’s Speed Band.


MOUNTAINOUS OR ROCKY TERRAIN
Mountainous terrain forces Travellers to think in three
dimensions. A destination may not be far away but if it
is on the shoulder of a different mountain then getting
there might be a challenge. Some mountainous terrain
is essentially impassable to ground vehicles; Travellers
on foot might have to laboriously climb steep slopes or
cliffs. Even non-mountainous rocky terrain like Badlands
can be very difficult for vehicles, with sudden drops or
gulleys requiring a long backtrack to get around.


Ground vehicles operating in mountainous terrain
will be able to manage at most 25% of normal speed
unless a good road has been driven through the
mountains. This is an average, of course; there may be
areas where the terrain is flat enough for short bursts
of higher speed but there will also be those that have to
be crawled through. Rocky Badlands can be traversed
at up to 50% of normal speed without undue hazard.
Beyond this, a Routine (6+) Drive check is needed
every 1D hours to avoid a mishap. The vehicle’s Speed
Band serves as a negative DM on this roll.

88

Terrain, Conditions and movement


**DESERT**
A desert is defined by extremely low rainfall and not
by any temperature conditions. Some deserts are very
hot, others are dry arctic regions. A rainshadow desert
can be caused by a mountain range, which causes
moisture-laden air to rise and dump its contents on one
side of the mountains with little reaching the other.

An arid plain or semi-desert can be traversed at normal
speed, although there may be deep gulleys where
intermittent flooding has cut steep-sided channels.
These are sometimes concealed or resemble folds in
the ground which turn out to be much more hazardous
than they first appear.

Sandy or dusty deserts are much slower going. Firm
sand or dust-covered rock can be traversed at full
speed by hovercraft or low ground pressure vehicles
such as tracklayers and multi-wheel ATVs but will slow
more conventional vehicles to 75% of normal speed.
Soft sand or dunes will slow low ground pressure
vehicles to 50% of normal speed. Normal vehicles such
as a typical off-road car will become stuck within a few
kilometres and only be able to progress by a laborious
round of digging out and struggling along for a while
until the next difficult stretch. This process slows the
vehicle to 10% of normal speed.

Very soft sand or dust can be completely impassable
even for track-laying vehicles. Low ground pressure
vehicles can labour along at 20% of normal speed
most of the time but a Difficult (10+) Drive check is
required every 2D hours to avoid becoming stuck.
Extricating a vehicle which has become stuck in soft
sand is virtually impossible, making such areas an
effective barrier to ground transportation.

**AQUATIC TERRAIN**
Aquatic terrain includes deep water, the surface of
seas and lakes, and shorelines or shallows. It poses
some very obvious problems to Travellers – namely
breathing underwater and moving around in an aquatic
environment – but there are many other factors to
consider. Chief among these is pressure, which
increases very quickly with depth (see page 68).


The surface layer of a sea or large lake can be very
active and waves can affect underwater craft. This is
hazardous in shallow water, dragging a submarine
around and possibly causing collisions. At depths of
more than 30 metres, the effects of most surface waves
are negligible. However, deep water can have violent
currents and eddies around seabed terrain and other
hazardous phenomena can be encountered. Seabed
‘rivers’ are sometimes cut by fast-moving currents and
‘waterfalls’ can occur when a current crosses the edge
of a steep depression in the seabed. These currents
can endanger underwater craft or structures.


A vehicle that is not adapted to operate in water
will, obviously, sink sooner or later. Very well sealed
vehicles might bob about for some time but will not
function properly and ultimately fill up with water. A
properly adapted vehicle may float but it will need some
means of propulsion or it will be at the mercy of wind
and current. Adaptations usually include ballasting to
reduce the chance of rolling over but even so, most
semi-aquatic vehicles are capable of operating only in
calm water. A vehicle with a drive system designed to
be used in water, such as a water-jet system, will be
able to travel at the speed dictated by its drive system.
Those that use a basic system such as wheel rotation
or a tiny auxiliary propeller are typically limited to 5%
of their road speed. Unless a vehicle has a boat-form
hull or similar design, it will be very clumsy in water and
subject to a great deal of drag. This will limit its ability
to go against a current that a boat with a similar drive
system could power through.


Marshy or boggy terrain slows ground vehicles to 25%
of their road speed; less if there is thick undergrowth.
Water that is shallow enough to drive through slows
vehicles to 50% of their road speed if the bottom is firm
and 10–20% if the bottom is uneven or soft. Both kinds
of terrain can conceal hazards such as deeper areas,
soft mud or concealed obstructions.


VACUUM
A world with a Trace atmosphere, or none at all, will
have little or no erosion in the usual sense. Rock
formations tend to be jagged and some areas will be
impenetrable to vehicles. In addition to the difficulties
associated with operating in vacuum – such as
needing to maintain suit integrity and a reliable
source of air to breathe – this terrain can impose a
number of additional hazards.

Terrain, Conditions and movement


TRAVELLER


Areas of bedrock may be fairly smooth, especially
if they originated as lava flows, but typically there
will be crevices and uneven areas which make
movement at speed hazardous. Bedrock or the
bottom of a meteorite crater can be navigated at 75%
of off-road speed without undue hazard.


Regolith is uncompacted material such as dust and
small rocks covering bedrock in a layer that may be
very deep. It is not unduly hazardous to move on in
and of itself but can conceal hazards such as dust
pools or crevasses. Regolith slows movement to
50% of off-road speed.


Rocky terrain includes crater walls and generally
uneven areas. Parts of a rocky region may be entirely
impenetrable to vehicles and could pose a severe
threat of falls or suit damage to personnel on foot. Best
speed through even the most navigable parts of a rocky
region is 25% of off-road speed.


ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS
Atmospheric conditions cause a variety of problems for
Travellers. Very thin or dense atmospheres can cause
breathing difficulties, requiring a respirator or similar
equipment. However, there are more subtle hazards
that can result from local atmospheric conditions;
hazards that might not be recognised in time.


Thin atmospheres tend not to carry dust particles
and moisture as readily as thicker air. Erosion will
be less evident and clouds are likely to be thin and
wispy. This can improve visibility but also reduces the
temperature regulating effects of a thick cloud base.
Night-time temperatures will drop quickly, although
the air will usually be dryer so frost and ice are less
likely to form. Rain will fall closer to the water sources
it evaporated from, resulting in dry areas, and dust will
also fall out of the air more quickly. Travellers trying to
predict the movement of an ash cloud from a volcano,
for example, may find their calculations quite wrong.
Strong winds are unlikely to be common and flying
creatures will have to be very light if they exist at all,
assuming local gravity conditions are similar to those
of Earth. Similarly, vegetation may grow taller and be
generally more spindly than Travellers might expect
since wind effects are minimal.


A thin atmosphere makes winged aircraft problematic
but can make operating grav craft safer than elsewhere
since they are unlikely to be blown around or
encounter visibility-reducing conditions. Conversely,
a dense atmosphere will have many opposite effects,
increasing erosion and regulating temperatures a
little more evenly. Wind effects can be quite extreme,
with pressure changes sometimes sufficient to cause
damage. Dense-atmosphere worlds with a fair amount
of surface water can be very wet, with thick clouds
carrying large quantities of water far inland and
dumping it in spectacular storms.


Hurricanes and similar phenomena are also likely to
be more intense on a dense-atmosphere world than
on Earth and what constitutes a windy day on a dense
atmosphere world might by quite different to what the
Travellers are expecting. Wind is not normally that
much of a hazard to a vehicle or starship but trying to
drive an ATV on ice in extreme wind conditions, or land
on a narrow starport pad in very gusty conditions, might
be a real challenge. Some dense atmosphere worlds
are sufficiently violent that small objects are routinely
flung around by the wind. It may be that outside a few
sheltered locations, an otherwise habitable world might
be simply too windy to be useful.


Modest winds pose no unusual problems for flying
vehicles or spacecraft but high winds and storm
conditions can make take-off and landing difficult and
can even bring down grav vehicles.


High Winds impose DM-2 on Pilot or Flyer checks
Storm Winds impose DM-4 on Pilot or Flyer checks
Hurricane Winds impose DM-6 on Pilot or Flyer
checks and make winged flight all but impossible
Hurricane Plus conditions are rare but can occur on
some worlds. All Pilot and Flyer checks are subject
to DM-8 and most vehicles cannot take off at all.
Starships have the mass to give them some stability
but operations are highly dangerous all the same
Very Thin atmospheres alter these DMs by +3
Thin atmospheres alter these DMs by +2
Dense atmospheres alter these DMs by -2
Super-Dense atmospheres alter these DMs by -4


Thus a hurricane in a Thin atmosphere world imposes
DM-4 on Pilot checks; a storm on a Dense atmosphere
world imposes DM-6.

Terrain, Conditions and movement


More extreme atmospheric conditions can result
from oddly shaped worlds or unusual surface
features, or from very high or very low atmospheric
pressure. A world with very pronounced equatorial
bulges might have significant pressure differences
between the equator and the poles, making one or
the other hazardous. Alternatively, a world with a
very thin atmosphere might have deep valleys where
the air is breathable and one with an excessively
dense atmosphere could have plateaux or mesas
where again the air is at a breathable pressure.
Whilst a technological society could build cities
anywhere, travel between these safe zones might be
hazardous and a regressed colony might be broken
into isolated sub-groups by the invisible barriers
between habitable regions.

LANDING IN DIFFICULT TERRAIN
Starships and grav vehicles do not usually need to
make a rolling, aerodynamic landing, although it is
still common to approach a landing area on a gradual
descent in the manner of a winged flying vehicle as this
reduces clutter in the airspace directly above the port.
A relatively light grav vehicle such as an air/raft can
land almost anywhere; even on water if it is capable of
floating. Starships have rather more ground pressure
and normally require a prepared landing area.


Travellers approaching a designated landing area,
even if it is just a stretch of marked bedrock, can
normally be confident it will support the weight of their
ship. Disasters do happen, of course; a landing area
might have been undermined by subsidence or even
deliberately sabotaged to damage the next vessel that
arrives. However, in most cases a prepared landing
area will be able to support any craft that can fit on it.


Wilderness landings are more hazardous. It is not
possible to be entirely certain the terrain is as firm
or even as it looks. A good sensors operator can
take a lot of the guesswork out of finding a suitable
landing site but nothing is certain. If the Travellers fly
around looking for somewhere suitable to land their
ship, they must make a Difficult (10+) Electronics
(sensors) check (2D x 10 minutes, INT) and apply
the Effect as a DM on the Starship Landing table.
DM-2 applies per attempt after the first.


This assumes active sensors such as radar are in use,
which will advertise the Travellers’ presence to anyone
scanning for electromagnetic emissions. If a site is
to be ‘eyeballed’ instead using only passive sensors,
the Recon or Pilot skill can be used but the check is
Very Difficult (12+) and the landing is subject to all the
potential hazards of a wilderness landing.


If the Travellers successfully locate a suitable landing
area or one is marked for them, the landing is no more
difficult or hazardous than usual. Gusts and eddies might
make things tricky for the pilot but the ground will support
their ship once it gets down. If, on the other hand the
Travellers choose to put their ship down right here, they
are exposed to all the risks of a wilderness landing.


Assuming the pilot makes some attempt to land in a
fairly clear area, a Difficult (10+) Pilot check (DEX) is
required to get the ship on the ground safely. If the
Travellers decide to land in a particularly hazardous
area this check is Formidable (14+). For example, the
Travellers decide to set down in very rugged terrain
or settle into the treetops and allow their ship’s weight
to crunch through the branches until they reach the
ground. The Effect of this check is applied to a 2D roll
on the Wilderness Landing table.


A ship can become stuck against solid objects like
rocks or buildings, or may sink into ground that is softer
than it looked. This may require digging, shoring up of
loose ground, or other heavy work to free the vessel.

# A NIMAL ENCOUNTERS

Travellers may encounter all manner of animal life
during the course of their adventures. It is relatively
easy to figure out where a given creature fits into the
local ecosystem and how dangerous it is likely to be
but, occasionally, Travellers might encounter something
very odd or which does not fit the usual description
of an animal. There is always a reason for any given
feature an animal possesses but nature sometimes
moves in very mysterious ways.

Resilient Animals
The physical nature of some creatures means
that some weapons do not adversely affect them
very well, or at all. Some creatures are resistant to
particular types of injuries, which modifies any armour
Protection they have.

Reduced Damage indicates a weapon’s damage
dice should be reduced to D3, retaining any plus
or minus. Thus, a handgun normally doing 3D-3
damage would do 3D3-3.

Minimum Damage indicates a weapon delivers only
one point of damage per dice, ignoring any plus or
minus. Thus, a handgun normally delivering 3D-3
damage and a powerful rifle normally doing 3D+2 would
both deliver only three points of damage as their bullets
pass through the creature with equally poor effect.

ANIMAL TRAITS
The following Traits can apply to any creature, although
some are obviously unsuitable for certain environments.

Clever: Clever animals can learn to operate simple
devices. They will know what effect they are trying to
achieve but have no understanding of the principles
behind it. For example, a Clever creature might observe
Travellers operating the cargo hoist in their ship and
learn that it can ride the containers into the ship, or lift
one up to obtain a higher vantage point. Cleverness
combined with aggression creates a very dangerous
predator capable of stalking Travellers through doors
they think are secured; less violent creatures can still
cause havoc by playing with the controls of a vehicle. A
Clever animal can figure out how to use a simple device
or control such as a door panel on a 2D roll of 10+,
made each time it sees someone perform the task.


Composite (x+y): Composite creatures are
actually made up of multiple parts than can operate
independently. For example, a creature may appear
to be a single organism until disturbed, at which point
several parts detach themselves and attack intruders.
Composite creatures are rare and often confuse
observers into thinking they are entirely separate
organisms. Hits for a Composite creature refer to
its main body, if it has one. Detached parts have a
quarter of this amount but harming them does no
damage to the main body. The number of component
parts is denoted in the format x+y, where x is the
number of critical, or main, components and y is the
number of detachable parts.


Dispersed: Dispersed creatures do not have the
usual concentration of functions into large organs but
instead disperse life processes throughout their bodies.
Dispersed creatures take Reduced Damage from most
weapons but full damage from blades and fire – they
can be cut apart or burned but poking them full of holes
or bashing their squashy appendages has little effect.


Energy: Creatures composed of pure energy are
postulated to exist, although their life processes are so
exotic as to defy explanation. Energy creatures are not
affected by conventional weapons.


Explosive (x,y): Explosive animals contain substances
that burn hotly or even explode when exposed to the
atmosphere. Such organisms tend to be extremely
exotic and rare, since exploding on contact with air
would normally be an evolutionary liability. An Explosive
creature’s capabilities are denoted in the format:
(damage, radius) so one listed as Explosive (1D, 3m)
causes 1D damage to everything in a three metre
radius if it is exposed to atmosphere.


Floater: Floaters are very low-density creatures which
drift on air currents without actually being able to fly. By
definition they have little structure and are not resilient,
and thus usually also possess the Gossamer trait.
Floaters can move under their own power but only at a
rate of one metre per combat round.


TRAVELLER


Gossamer: A Gossamer creature has virtually
no structure and few solid parts for a weapon
to damage. Gossamer creatures take Minimum
Damage from most weapons – stabbing, crushing,
impaling, projectile and even laser weapons do
Minimum Damage.


Gigantic: Gigantic creatures normally exist in liquid
environments, although there are exceptions from
time-to-time. The smallest creature considered to be
Gigantic might weigh 100,000 kilograms – equivalent
to a Blue Whale. A creature with the Gigantic trait
is treated as a Spacecraft scale object (see page
157 of the Traveller Core Rulebook) for purposes of
dealing and sustaining damage.


Ornery: Ornery creatures are unnecessarily
aggressive and might attack in response to trigger
behaviour that cannot be predicted. They will seem
to kill for no reason, slaughtering livestock and
eating only a small proportion of the kills. Ornery
creatures will attack Travellers (or even vehicles)
on a roll of 8+ on 2D, increasing to 10+ on 2D if the
creatures are heavily outnumbered.


Particulate: A Particulate animal is made up of small
and more or less independent components; a swarm
of bees or ants could be considered to be a single
particulate creature. Some highly exotic organisms
are made of particles, making them very difficult
to kill. Fire-based attacks have full effect; all other
weapons do Minimum Damage.


Strange: Strange creatures are disturbing to humans
and most other sentients who see or hear them. They
may make sounds or project a low-level telepathic
field that causes unease, or simply look ‘wrong’ in a
way that inspires fear and even madness. Strange
creatures range from normal animals that move in a
particularly sinister way to something straight out of
a horror movie. Any Traveller encountering a Strange
creature must make a Difficult (10+) END check. If it is
failed, roll 2D on the Strange Animal table and apply
the Effect of the failed check.


Tough: Tough animals are unusually resilient. They
take Reduced Damage and when disabled or killed
there is a chance that the creature will rally and
continue the fight. 1D rounds after the creature goes
down, the Referee should roll 2D. On 8+ the creature
regains a quarter of its normal Hits and continues to
act as normal. It is unusual for a creature to be able to
do this more than once but at the Referee’s discretion
a Tough creature can keep rallying until it fails, at
which point it will expire.


Toxic (range, damage): Toxic animals have some
noxious substance within their tissues or on their
skin. This is not the same thing as a venomous
creature introducing a toxin with a bite; it is a more
unusual situation in which the creature may spit or
bleed acid or some other dangerous substance, or
undergoes a change when it dies which causes its
carcass to become hazardous.


Vacuum: Very few creatures can exist in a complete
vacuum and those that do tend to be very strange. A
greater variety of organisms live in partial vacuum or
extremely low pressure environments and some of
those can survive a complete vacuum for a time. This
trait indicates the ability to function in hard vacuum
even if the creature cannot live there indefinitely.


The following creatures can be found on worlds with
a breathable atmosphere and conditions that humans
would at least find tolerable with assistance.

0 or less The Traveller panics or faints and is out

10+ The Traveller is momentarily shocked,

**Alversen's Nightmare**
The nightmare is a long, sinuous creature with thickly
muscled hind legs and three more sets of smaller
limbs along its body. The front pair are positioned for
digging, the others for pushing its body though the
resulting tunnel. The nightmare’s head is protected by
a thick bony plate, giving it a nightmarish (hence the
name) aspect. The way it moves above ground in a
series of sinuous rushes and its generally disgusting
slime-covered aspect causes a mix of revulsion and
terror in most observers.

Nightmares are carnivorous and will often tunnel into
an area then hide below the surface before striking
at livestock or even people. They are hard to kill and
extremely aggressive. Rumours of nightmares nesting
in groups have never been proven.

Rajjers
Rajjers are herd creatures resembling large deer,
although rather than antlers they have forward-
curving horns like a bull and a set of tusks that allows
them to present a set of sharp points to an aggressor.
They are normally found in small herds of around
20–30 individuals, grazing on ground vegetation and
nibbling at bushes. Rajjers are normally docile and
will wander away from Travellers who get too close.
They are not territorial and will share a region with
other herds or entirely different species if grazing is
good and they are not threatened.


A low-level threat will be countered by one or more
males, which will attempt to drive off interlopers
with a display of stamping and a strange neighing
bark that many humans find comical. This is
unfortunate, as the warning is very serious. Rajjers
have a matriarchal society and at a command
from the dominant female one or more males will
become suicidally aggressive. This command may
be pheromonal or a combination of behaviour and
stance but is thought by some to be telepathic.


A Rajjers that has been triggered in this manner
gains the Rage and Tough traits. It is thought that the
dominant female can calm an enraged male but little
research has been done on the subject.

Kanderson's Greymass
Kanderson’s greymass resembles a shapeless grey
blob (hence the name) that gloops slowly up a bush
or tree and hangs from it, or secretes itself in a place
where small creatures may pass by. It is found on
several worlds, having been unwittingly carried in spore
form by colonists and explorers.


The greymass does not seem to like dry environments
but has adapted to many worlds across a range of
temperature and atmospheric conditions. The mass is
an extremely simple creature which feeds mainly on
plant and animal matter that drifts into it on the wind
or blunders into a semi-camouflaged maw where it is
trapped by muscle contractions. The maw can crush
small creatures but cannot harm something as large as
a human’s foot. However, it is difficult to pull anything
out once a greymass has a good grip on it and digestive
acids will slowly dissolve anything that does not escape.


To drag something (like a trapped foot) out of a
greymass, a Difficult (10+) STR check is necessary.
DM+2 applies for each of up to four people assisting
the trapped Traveller. One attempt can be made to free
a Traveller every 10 minutes. The victim will sustain
1D damage from acid every 10 minutes, including the
period in which they are freed.


Lacking much in the way of a brain or developed
organs, the greymass is hard to kill. Fortunately it poses
relatively little threat to humans, being only about three
metres across and unable to ‘swallow’ more than a
boot. Indeed, the biggest hazard to humans is self-
injury caused by trying to pull a trapped foot out of the
greymass’ maw. The greymass is apparently unable to
let go of anything that is still moving and has quite a grip.

**Riverdipper**
The riverdipper is a peculiar little beast. It seems
to be some kind of mammal or marsupial herbivore
that dwells in small communities of up to a dozen
individuals along the banks of watercourses. ’Dippers
feed off plants growing on the banks and forage among
the river-bottom weeds. They are good swimmers and
can also glide short distances in the manner of a flying
squirrel, allowing spectacular dives into the water from
improbable distances.

For all they live in family groups, these little critters
are very antisocial. They bicker constantly and fight
frequently. These fights tend not to be very serious, with
actual blows rarely struck and never any biting. Fights
involve ’dippers throwing a lot of small objects at one
another, all the while posturing and squealing like crazy.

Gang fights are quite entertaining, as a mob of
’dippers will jump around squealing, flinging things
at one another and occasionally run up and bash
one of the opposing side before gliding or running


away. Their antics are made more interesting by
what seems to be a sense of fair play – if one side is
being roughed up too much, some will change sides
to help them out. They also do this to gang up on an
individual that is being too rough.


Human scientists have no idea why these little
guys fight or even who is winning much of the time,
but it is fun to watch. ’Dippers pose little threat to
Travellers, although they will steal small objects to
throw at one another and may try to eat bootlaces
and other small semi-edible items. Attempts to turn
them into pets have universally failed.

Stingstorm
A stingstorm is a mob of small creatures resembling
very small flying lizards. Often known as stormers,
these creatures are aggressively territorial and will
attack quite large creatures. Individually puny (and
less than three centimetres long), they are capable of
bringing down a large animal or human.


A mob of stormers makes a confusing target and although
individuals are easy to kill there are many of them. Some
will be attached to the target, nipping and biting, while
others fly about screeching. One tactic stormers like to
use is to crash themselves into the head of the prey,
latching on with their tiny claws for a few seconds then
flying off leaving a mass of scratches behind.


Wounds inflicted on a stingstorm (as the swarm is
known) represent casualties and Stormers driven off.
When enough damage is done to ‘disable’ the swarm
(enough hits are inflicted to make a normal creature
unconscious), the Stormers will usually retreat. A
Stingstorm can attack only as a mass of tiny nips but
blood loss and damage to fingers or eyes can be serious.

Peak Floater
Peak floaters have been described as ‘jellyfish of
the air’, which is a reasonable approximation of their
appearance. A floater consists of a central gasbag
and numerous tendrils, which have poisonous stingers
along their length. These cannot harm a Traveller
through clothing but will inject a nasty venom into
surface tissues they contact, causing swelling and
pain. The gasbag is filled with an extremely low-
density gas produced by natural reactions within
the creature, which are themselves fuelled by exotic
compounds. Rupturing the bag releases the gas,
resulting in a burst of flame or a small explosion which
scatters parts of the creature. These will also burst
into flame, creating a minor fire hazard.


Peak floaters typically drift around hilltops or
mountains where the air is cold, feeding on insects
caught by their sticky tendrils. These are gently
dragged over bushes and other vegetation, and can
be brought into contact with Travellers this way. These
creatures are of very low intelligence, just drifting and
feeding, and will not take any sort of deliberate action.
They can, however, be a real problem when their
numbers grow beyond a handful.

**Krvn**
Krvn are vaguely arachnoid creatures originally
thought to be native to a single world in the Spinward
Marches. They have since been identified on several
widely spaced planets and it is thought they were
transplanted as beasts of burden in the distant past.
An adult krvn has six primary legs plus four smaller
manipulators which can provide additional stability,
and a central body around one metre in length. Krvn
are not strong enough to be ridden but can pull a sled
or carry a light pack at considerable speed, even over
swampy terrain or snow.

Krvn are omnivorous and capable of burrowing
through dense soil. Their nests contain dozens,
perhaps hundreds, of workers and one or more large
breeders which are rarely seen aboveground. Krvn are
sometimes mistaken for the much more dangerous
chamax, to which they bear a vague resemblance.
Domestication is not really possible as such but a krvn
worker will respond to simple commands (usually in the
form of prods delivered manually or by a small harness)
in a docile and hard-to-spook way. This makes them
useful for some forms of work but they cannot be
trained to carry out complex tasks.

Krvn-Espaan
Some populations of krvn live in a symbiotic
relationship with a warm-blooded species known as the
espaan. These are small, furry creatures resembling
a six-legged starfish, which attach themselves to the
undersides of worker krvn and direct their actions. It
is not clear how they interact with breeders in the nest
but espaan are known to live in krvn communities and
presumably contribute to the functioning of the nest.


Espaan are more intelligent than krvn workers and
can direct them in complex tasks. They are also more
territorial than a typical krvn nest and may send a
force of workers to attack a quite distant settlement if
the espaan consider it is a threat. Krvn-espaan nests
are less regular in layout than sole-krvn constructions,
making effective use of variations in soil composition
rather than simply digging random tunnels. These nests
tend to be bigger and more successful than a sole-krvn
nest, making the symbiosis an effective one.

Cliffhanger
The cliffhanger is a surprisingly common food animal
on worlds without much flat land. Resembling a
tubby goat in many ways, the cliffhanger is extremely
agile and can forage on near-vertical rocky surfaces
that would daunt an experienced human climber.
Cliffhangers have sharp claws that can be used for
self-defence but are generally peaceable creatures
who have few natural predators. They are herded on
some worlds by airborne drones, although lower-tech
societies have to rely on daring climber-herdsmen.


Cliffhangers form loose herds in the wild, generally
using their difficult home environment for protection
rather than any deliberate measures. They are
capable of surviving on a minimal diet of very poor-
quality vegetation for some time but animals that
become weak or sick rarely survive long as a result
of their dangerous habitat.

’Trator
The ’trator is a biologically engineered creature
designed for infiltration of enemy installations; hence
its name. Some specimens appear to have escaped
from their handlers and formed a small breeding
population, although their origin is sufficiently
secret that they are normally thought to be naturally
occurring creatures. The ’trator is a cold-blooded
quadruped about 10 centimetres long, with a flexible
outer carapace and unnaturally powerful claws and
teeth. ’Trators can be fitted with a camera-and-
command pack but are sometimes simply introduced
into an installation and allowed to roam free.


’Trators can cause immense damage, which looks to
have been caused by natural creatures rather than
deliberate sabotage, and for this reason are sometimes
used for deniable corporate sabotage operations.

**Oieite’aiy**
The oieite’aiy has various names in different languages
but official databases typically use the original
Trokh (Aslan) designation. Oieite’aiy are aggressive
pentapods which hunt in small packs of three to six
individuals. About the size of a [[Terra|Terran]] wolf, they have
four normal legs and an additional longer and more
powerful hind leg which provides incredible springing
ability. Oieite’aiy normally attack their prey as a team,
with some individuals inducing it to run before others
spring from the sides and knock it down. Once downed,
the prey animal is allowed to stand before being
knocked down again, rapidly inducing exhaustion.

Oieite’aiy favour open terrain but can be encountered
in hilly or cluttered areas. Packs are not territorial in the
long term; they migrate over long distances apparently
at whim. However, a pack will defend its current hunting
ground against most interlopers, although occasionally
a warning display comprising a great deal of leaping
and snarling is sufficient to make new arrivals withdraw.

Brown Forester
A creature somewhat similar to the [[Terra|Terran]] brown bear,
the brown forester is normally encountered in small
family groups. Powerfully muscled and covered in thick
fur, this animal favours wooded uplands and can be
quite territorial. According to some reports they are
semi-intelligent; sufficiently so that unwary hunters are
sometimes lured into an ambush.


Claims of shaped stone tools used by these creatures
attracted interest a few years ago but have been
dismissed as a hoax. However, brown foresters are
clever creatures and quiet for their size. They have
been known to sneak into camps or settlements to
steal food, sometimes inadvertently taking important
items that are not edible, such as tools or components
of a field stove. These items are often found chewed,
smashed or thoroughly ‘investigated’ by these
inquisitive and powerful animals.

Skreee!
Named for the hideous sound they make, skreee! are
generally harmless to humans and similar creatures.
They are avians with a small central body and a tiny
head on a long neck, with leathery wings better suited
to gliding and soaring on thermals than powerful
flapping. Skreee! feed on small ground-dwelling
animals, swooping down to grab prey then ascending
back to a high perch to feed. Their attack takes the
form of a stoop, which is surprisingly fast and accurate.
However, skreee! do not change direction quickly and
are more successful at taking prey by surprise than
catching an animal on the run.


Skreee! are native to mountainous areas and can
often be heard long before they are spotted. Their
normal call is loud and pitched at an extremely
irritating frequency but pales into nothingness when
compared to their alarm screech. This alone has
been enough to drive explorers out of a region, even
without the skreee! engaging in their other annoying
habit, that of swooping down to snatch food, tools and
random small objects. Skreee! will even take items
right out of a Traveller’s hand.

Larulli’s Predator
Larulli’s predator is a nasty mid-sized equivalent to
the cheetah in many ways. Operating in mated pairs
or packs of three to five juveniles, its usual method of
attack is a sudden rush from cover, knocking the victim
down. The attacking beast will usually then spring clear
and begin posturing, getting the target’s attention as
it tries to rise. This allows the partner or pack to close
and deliver a crippling bite and, once down, the victim
is usually worried to death.


Predators are well camouflaged and fast, with a
bullet-shaped head filled with razor teeth designed
more for slashing bites than serious fighting. Their
furry bodies are lean and built for short-distance
speed and a powerful lunge. They have claws but
these are secondary to their teeth as weapons and
almost never used.


Predators seem to dislike a straight fight, even with
a harmless foe. They prefer to dash in and out,
presumably to avoid the lashing hooves of a victim.
Larulli’s predators are willing to attack humans and
should be treated with caution even by armed personnel.

**Sesquipin**
The sesquipin is a large and very odd-looking flying
creature, which many Travellers find quite disturbing.
It appears to have three bodies, each of which has a
claw-tipped prehensile tail. In fact two of the bodies are
better described as organ and muscle nodes. These
secondary nodes are about the size of a large dog,
whilst the central body is approximately four times as
large. The central body contains the digestive organs
and main cardio-respiratory system, with a smaller
secondary heart and lung in each of the secondary
nodes, connected to the main body by a segment of the
long upper wing-membrane.


A shorter pair of lower wings, tipped in vicious talons,
attaches directly to the central body. These are
capable of very fine control for rapid manoeuvering
or can act as hands, whilst the long upper wing
makes an augmented flapping motion powered by the
extra muscle nodes. This movement looks distinctly
unnatural to most observers but provides excellent
lifting capability. Sesquipins operate in flocks of 10–30
individuals, mobbing their prey and tearing it to shreds
with their lethal claws.

AQUATIC ANIMALS
These creatures require an aquatic environment. They
may live entirely underwater or in an interface zone
where they interact with land or air creatures.


Vent Swarmer
Vent swarmers are small creatures, typically no more
than two centimetres in length. They are naturally
found in chemical-rich waters such as those close to
ocean-floor geothermal vents and often form colonies
close to outlet pipes from industrial premises or seabed
settlements. They are not harmful in their own right but
can clog machinery or damage piping. Their presence
in large numbers tends to attract predators which
creates a secondary hazard.


Swarmers are highly active, darting about in
concentrations of dozens of creatures amid an overall
population of thousands. Depending on the chemical
content of the waters they frequent, some swarmer
communities can interfere with sensors, and most
create sufficient disturbance that the surrounding
waters are constantly murky due to seabed sediment.
They are of little value as a food source due to their
unpleasant taste and possibility of contamination, and
are widely regarded as a major nuisance.

Cuttlehorror
The cuttlehorror was named, perhaps a little over-
dramatically, for its resemblance to a [[Terra|Terran]] cuttlefish.
The cuttlehorror is vastly larger however, and does
not seem to have any ability to change colour. At an
average of around 10 metres long, the cuttlehorror
is larger on average than a great white shark and
inhabits a similar ecological niche. However, whilst
the great white does not deserve its reputation as a
people-killer, the cuttlehorror truly does.


Cuttlehorrors are normally solitary creatures, as
befits their highly destructive nature. They will attack
almost anything that ventures into their territory and
have been known to range widely searching for
something to kill. Cuttlehorrors often attack even when
not hungry and apparently kill for the fun of it. They
have been known to take on submarines and surface
vessels, and are astonishingly persistent even when
their intended target is made of metal.

**Bootwrap**
Another creature whose scientific name is unknown
to most Travellers, the bootwrap is a shallow-water
dweller resembling a spongy mass one to three metres
in diameter. It is possible that there are numerous
species of similar creatures; bootwraps have been
reported in both fresh and seawater areas. The primary
danger they pose to Travellers is a tendency to bunch
and clamp around an object that comes into contact
with the bootwrap’s upper surface.

The bootwrap is an extremely primitive creature, with
life functions dispersed throughout its structure. Any
tissue that touches organic material tightens around
it and begins to digest its catch. This can take days in
the case of a boot or vehicle tyre but during this time a
Traveller might be endangered by rising tides or other
hazards. Pulling a foot free of a bootwrap requires an
immediate Difficult (10+) STR check. If this is failed,
the check increases to Very Difficult (12+) and the
Traveller may make a new attempt every hour until
they escape or are dissolved. Killing the bootwrap is
difficult due to its dispersed structure, although much
of one could be cut away until the small remaining part
is relatively easy to remove.

Pointer Fish
The pointer fish is a harmless cold-water fish with an
unusually strong ability to detect electromagnetic fields.
They are attracted to seabed cables and underwater
operations of any kind, as well as naturally occurring
magnetic fields. Pointer fish will align themselves with a
magnetic field and follow it, sometimes without regard
to obstacles. This can create concentrations of fish at
choke points, which in turn attracts predators.


Pointer fish have been introduced to many ecosystems
as part of aquaculture projects – they can be ‘herded’
by submersibles fitted with electromagnets which
makes harvesting and population monitoring relatively
easy. Pointer fish also breed in the wild and can
unbalance an ecosystem if not kept under control.

Lakefang
A large air-breathing swimming predator vaguely
resembling a [[Terra|Terran]] plesiosaur, the lakefang has
spindly legs and is slow out of water but can reach a
considerable distance with its long neck to deliver a
powerful bite. Adults are solitary but young lakefangs
swim in packs of anywhere up to a dozen until they
are more or less mature. Packs can turn on one
another; indeed, the equivalent of a coming-of-age
celebration for a lakefang is the day it savages its
siblings and eats them.


Lakefangs sometimes attack boats, either by
bumping them from underneath to spill the occupants
or more often by simply sinking its teeth into the
vessel and jerking about until it is sunk, then chasing
down the occupants. It is not known whether
lakefangs do this because they see a boat as a
threat or simply out of spite.

Swamp Queen
The swamp queen appears to be a composite creature
comprising a central body mass – or sometimes multiple
masses connected by tendrils – and numerous outlying
tentacles attached to smaller fleshy concentrations. The
main masses, containing critical organs, are usually
located underwater or in soft sediment, with tentacles
grappling prey towards a nearby mouth. An average-
sized swamp queen can take prey up to the size of
a small deer, although typically they feed on fish and
amphibians dwelling in their body of water. Rumours
persist of much larger queens which pose a serious
hazard to livestock or even passing vehicles.


It is not clear if a multiple-node swamp queen should
be considered a single organism or a group. Organs
are duplicated, enabling a mass cut off from the rest
to survive on its own, but a node can be kept alive by
others for many months, healing from even the most
severe damage. Getting rid of a swamp queen thus
requires finding all nodes and completely destroying
them, usually by fire or other indiscriminate means.
A swamp queen node typically has 30 Hits, whilst its
detachable tentacles have 7 Hits each. All nodes must
be found and killed to eliminate the creature, which
typically has 1D nodes.

EXOTIC ENVIRONMENT ANIMALS
The following creatures exist in an environment that
would kill unassisted humans. Their home conditions
may include low atmospheric pressure or a hazardous
gas mix, or other dangerous characteristics.

**Hequib Ukide**
The hequib ukide is known by various names on
different worlds but most database entries use the
earliest known reference. This is an anglicised variant
of a phrase in the language of an obscure minor race,
which rather prosaically translates as ‘The Large
Crustacean That Threatens Our People’. The origins
of the hequib ukide are unknown but small populations
can be encountered on many worlds.

A full-grown hequib ukide resembles an eight-legged
lobster with an elongated body, with a pair of powerful
pincers and a secondary set of smaller arms below
its mouth. The hequib ukide can thrive in very thin or
trace atmosphere worlds and can even function in
hard vacuum for a time. Once its resources run down
it will become dormant, prolonging survival by several
months. It is thought these creatures have travelled
between star systems in this manner.


Hequib ukide are normally solitary, meeting to mate
once every few years then rapidly separating. Their
young are carried in a sac within the torso until they are
able to feed themselves, then dropped as the hequib
ukide trundles slowly on its way. Feeding is a constant
activity, with the secondary arms shovelling loose
matter into the creature’s maw as it moves. Most of this
matter is inert on many worlds but a hequib ukide can
extract nutrition from any organic material it encounters.


If turned loose on a world with a higher oxygen
concentration and plentiful organic matter, the hequib
ukide enters a feeding frenzy. It will eventually eat itself
to death but in the meantime can be highly destructive.
These creatures are also attracted to rich sources of
organic matter in their home environment, such as
trash dropped by Travellers or a badly sealed waste
dump port on a starship. The hequib ukide will fight
to get at such a rich source of food, where normally it
would simply trundle on its way.

Death-Cloud
The rather dramatically named death-cloud
resembles a cloud of dust particles floating freely
on an airless or trace atmosphere world. The cloud
adheres to surfaces it contacts – including a vacc
suit or starship hull – and slowly digests any matter
it encounters there. Death-clouds cannot eat through
metal but will eventually cause airlock seals to fail or
rupture polymer power conduits.


If a cloud gets inside a vehicle or structure, it will attack
organic matter first. This makes the death-cloud an
insidious threat rather than an instant one but getting the
cloud out of a vehicle can be a problem. Showering will
remove particles from a Traveller’s skin but this will put
them in the water supply where they may be consumed
or come into contact with other Travellers. It is possible
that there are ships drifting in space whose crew were
entirely eaten away by a cloud in the water supply,
although the process would take a very long time.


It is not clear how a death-cloud moves or senses
food sources. Some scientists postulate that the
cloud may be a particulate intelligence, with each
mote in contact with the others. If this is the case then
a large enough cloud might be capable of advanced
thought or even communication, but there is no
evidence to prove this. Clouds cannot be harmed by
most weapons, though particles can be incinerated or
dissolved in corrosive liquid.

Shade
The animals popularly known as shades are possibly
some kind of free energy phenomena, although they
behave in a manner that suggests they are in some
way alive. Most of the science connected with these
creatures is of an amateurish sort – few reputable
scientists even believe they exist and no detailed
study has been carried out. Exactly what a shade is
remains an open question. Some believe they are
beings from another universe or dimension, touching
this universe through a portal. Others claim they are
supernatural in nature.


Shades typically manifest as a pool of darkness
floating in the air and are sometimes described
as some kind of energy well. Light and heat will
flow into a shade, apparently obeying the laws of
thermodynamics, causing an area of dimness and
cold. If this contacts a Traveller, they will suffer 1D
damage per round, reduced to 1D3 if inside a vacc
suit or similarly protected armour. The shade will drain
the suit’s batteries rapidly and they seem to gravitate
towards such mid-level energy sources. This makes
shades dangerous to spacefarers operating outside a
vessel or on a hostile planet.


A shade can be dissipated or eliminated by intense
heat, light or other energy, although whether this
harms the animal or simply feeds it to the point
where it withdraws, sated, is unknown. Point sources
such as lasers have no apparent effect on the shade;
what is needed is a large energy source such as a
searchlight or bonfire.

**Alga Worm**
The alga worm is a thick, segmented creature which
can be mistaken for a section of conduit or piping,
native to exotic atmosphere worlds. Specimens grow
to a maximum of one metre in length and are more
typically 40–60 centimetres long. Alga worms are more
or less harmless in their own environment, except
perhaps as a trip hazard, but their tissues react with
oxygen in a violent and messy manner. When exposed
to a reasonable concentration of oxygen – about 10%
of a normal-pressure atmosphere – an alga worm will
undergo an exothermic reaction which can lead to the
animal cooking itself or even exploding.

Alga worms are harvested for the concentrated
chemicals that build up in their tissues. This
practice has been widely condemned as cruel and
is outlawed on some worlds. Transporting worm
carcasses is an additional problem; many ‘unofficial’
harvesting operations lack the equipment to properly
treat the worm’s tissues and as a result accidents
are not uncommon.

Kasman (Kashmanuggidagi)
The kasman was clearly known in the days of the First
Imperium, although the original Vilani name has since
been corrupted into something more pronounceable.
The kasman is an omnivore native to corrosive-
atmosphere worlds, with resemblance to an armoured
bear, and is protective of its territory. Kasman are
usually encountered in family groups of two adults and
two to six juveniles in various stages of development.


Kasman are large but agile and possess a powerful
set of claws. Their own armoured skin is more or
less impervious to these claws, so fights between
kasman are normally a matter of knockdown blows,
driving the loser off rather than killing it. Such
fights are quite common as family groups test the
boundaries of one another’s territory.

Lobug
The lobug is a nuisance found on several worlds,
having been carried there inadvertently by spacecraft.
They resemble woodlice to some extent, although
a typical lobug is about 50 centimetres long and 20
centimetres high to the crest of its shell. Lobugs can
survive extremely low pressures and even vacuum,
although hard vacuum forces them to curl up and
become dormant. They can remain thus for some years
but will eventually expire unless conditions that permit
the lobug to function return. Lobugs are only able to
tolerate normal pressures for a few minutes before
expiring; their bodily fluids tend to leak out when they
die under such conditions and stink very badly indeed.


Lobugs can infest areas of starships and spaceports
as well as low-pressure gray worlds. They are a
nuisance more than anything else, as they gnaw at
wiring insulation or burrow into cargo seeking food.
Although many starships depressurise the cargo hold
in transit, this rarely creates a perfect vacuum. Lobugs
thrive in this sort of environment, scuttling off to hide
when the pressure returns. They can be very hard
to find when they do so, although the ones that did
not make it to cover in time will make their position
evident to anyone with a nose.

Species D-8071 (Hull Net)
Species D-8071 is known by many unofficial names,
of which hull net may be the commonest. Native to
the upper atmospheres of gas giants, Species D-8071
resembles a loosely connected web of organic nodules.
It drifts on the winds and consumes primitive amino
acids or hydrocarbons formed by electrical activity and
turbulence. These animals are not hostile and may not
even be aware of passing vehicles, but can become
entangled on antennae or hull protrusions. This is not
normally a major problem but can lead to examples
being transferred to other atmospheres.


A ship that has become entangled in a hull net may
experience electrical disruptions due to the creature’s
powerful bio-electrical field. This can interfere with
sensors and the operation of the jump drive. The
only solution is to scrape off the net from outside the
ship, a time-consuming process that breaks it up but
may or may not kill it. Attempting to jump with a net
in place may have no effect or can cause the drive to
malfunction wildly; it is not always possible to predict
the effects from one jump to another.

# V EHICLE DAMAGE

The vehicle rules presented in the Traveller Core
Rulebook and Vehicle Handbook work very well but
there are some cases where loopholes can arise.
Small, light vehicles can be destroyed or disabled
with weapons that should not really be able to do
them much damage, including the fists of an angry
Traveller. In most cases where it is possible to destroy
a vehicle with light weapons, this would take a great
deal of time – blasting a sailing ship apart with a
shotgun might be possible but it is unlikely anyone
would expend the time or ammunition.

Then again, these are Travellers we are talking
about. The following rules are designed to prevent
exploitation of this loophole. Either or both can be
used at the Referee’s discretion.

ANTI-PERSONNEL WEAPONS
Weapons delivering less than 4D damage are defined
as anti-personnel weapons, as are all personal
weapons firing a multiple projectile (such as shotguns)
and those with the Stun trait. Any modifier to damage is
ignored for the purposes of this definition, so a weapon
doing 3D+8 damage would still be an anti-personnel
weapon whereas one doing 4D-4 would be outside the
anti-personnel category.


Anti-personnel weapons do no damage to vehicles
unless an Effect of 6 or more is scored on their attack
roll, in which case damage is reduced by 2D to a
minimum of 1 point.


BUILT TOUGH
Vehicles and structures are built from strong and resilient
materials. Against man portable weapons that are not
Destructive, a vehicle is considered to have an extra
amount of armour equal to the TL of its construction.


For example, an extremely angry Traveller tries to kick
his TL6 dune buggy to pieces. His unarmed combat
damage is 1D, +1 for his STR bonus. He boots the
vehicle as hard as he can, rolling a total of 7 for
damage. This would be enough to destroy the dune
buggy despite its armour Protection of 2 but for the 6
points of additional Protection it is assumed to have
due to its Tech Level. Our angry Traveller can inflict
quite a lot of cosmetic damage with his boot but he
cannot destroy the vehicle that way.


# R EFEREEING TRAVELLER

Refereeing a roleplaying game is part art, part science
and always a matter of personal style. There are many
possible ways to set up and run a game, ranging
from entirely freeform to something that resembles
a computer program with every possible detail and
eventuality provided for in the Referee’s notes. There
really is no ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ way to go about it so long
as everyone is enjoying the game.

It is easy to fall into the trap of becoming adversarial
towards the Travellers, especially if they insist on
wandering off the planned adventure path or take
unforeseen actions that derail the plot. However, the
Referee’s role is not to oppose the Travellers but to
administer the game in terms of interpreting rules
and determining the actions of other characters. The
Referee is there to facilitate interactions between
the Travellers and a universe that can sometimes be
friendly and often be hostile.

Occasionally a rule-as-written will result in a situation
that seems less than plausible; the Referee should
make a call and keep the game moving along. Hours
spent in pointless rules-lawyering are hours of your
life wasted. It is worth looking up a critical rule if it
makes a difference between a Traveller being dead or
just mangled, but lengthy discussions about exactly
what the game designers meant by a particular piece
of phrasing are futile.

It is up to the Travellers and Referee to work
together to create a game universe that is internally
consistent and basically fair (if sometimes harsh)
towards both Travellers and their opposition. A little
common sense goes a long way and whenever
things get confusing the Referee should make a call
and then get things moving again.

In short, the rules are a framework to hang a Traveller
campaign on. In the right hands they can perform
well and, like any other tool, they can also be abused.
Traveller is not about accurately modelling the
universe; it is about playing a game for entertainment,
and the Referee’s part in that is applying common
sense and keeping things fair.


It is the nature of adventure gaming that there will
be setbacks and disappointments, and not everyone
will always get what they want out of every session.
Overall, however, the objective is to have fun and
people who are not having fun will find something else
to do with their time.


Thus the Referee must find a balance between being
flexible and accommodating his Travellers’ desires
without just handing them what they want on a plate.
Similarly, the Referee must not compromise himself too
much for the Travellers’ benefit. Running a game you
do not enjoy is no fun.


Generally speaking, Traveller should include some,
most, or even all of the following elements:

- New experiences, sights or places
- Varied obstacles to overcome
- Believability in terms of setting and actions of
    characters encountered
- A chance to gain in monetary or other terms
- Character development in terms of both roleplaying
    and material acquisition
- The occasional mystery or puzzling event, object,
    or concept
- A feeling that the setting is ‘alive’ and things
    change while life goes on elsewhere


Perhaps the most important thing is that the Travellers
should feel they are the captains of their own fate.
That is, they really do have freewill rather than being
pushed around by the plotline. This is not to say that
there will not be insurmountable obstacles in some
directions, nor that all plans will work, but overall
Travellers are more likely to enjoy a game where they
can create goals for themselves and achieve them
with a realistic chance of success.


The Referee’s job is to create a setting in which the
Travellers can do these things and people it with
interesting and believable characters. These rules are a
set of guidelines to assist in that task but in the end it is
the Referee who makes or breaks a Traveller campaign.


**PLAY BALANCE**
Traveller does not subscribe to the concept of ‘play
balance’. A wealthy merchant will have as many guards
as she can afford or want, with skills and weapons
of a sort they would realistically have given local
circumstances. The guards need not be matched to the
ability or armament of the Travellers.

This works both ways. Sometimes the advantage will
be with the Travellers, sometimes with the opposition.
A clever group will use their skills and good roleplaying
to avoid fights they cannot win (and many they could)
and stack the odds in their favour. Those who just
blunder around trusting to body armour and automatic
weapons to solve every problem will eventually run into
something they cannot handle.

The Referee should be ruthless if the Travellers do
something really stupid. For example, in most localities
shooting at the cops will bring more cops, then special
response units with good weapons and armour. If the
Travellers are armed well enough to defeat the local
equivalent of a SWAT team, the authorities may decide
the planetary army or even the Imperial Marine Corps
will intervene. A group that decides they can defeat the
army is going to get killed, full stop.

On the other hand, being pursued by SWAT and a
horde of cops makes for a fun and exciting adventure.
The Referee should make the response realistic and let
the Travellers find a way to deal with it. Getting out of a
tight corner against hopeless odds by using desperate
measures is a staple of fun science fiction and good
gaming. Travellers who come up with a decent plan
should have a fair chance but the Referee should not
flinch from killing off Travellers who think they can
take on stupid odds and win just because they are the
heroes of their story.

The opposite side of this coin is the avoidance of bloat.
Bloat occurs when the Travellers become too wealthy
or powerful for the campaign. If the Referee gives
away huge amounts of Credits, dozens of starships
and extensive psionic training then the Travellers will
reach the stage where there is no point in them going
on adventures. It is possible to come up with a reason
why a duke, an admiral and a pirate lord might have to
deal with a major looming threat but after a while this
becomes implausible. In addition, the level of opposition
has to be immense for the adventure to be a challenge
and sooner or later this becomes dull or ridiculous.


It is far better to keep the Travellers hungry, letting them
profit a little from their adventures but always wanting
more. That way the Referee does not need to keep
coming up with reasons why yet another alien invasion
fleet has arrived or half the empire just revolted. A band
of gunmen might be a challenge for typical Travellers.
If the Travellers are all telepathic superheroes in
battle dress armed with fusion guns, a different level
of opposition is required, which becomes difficult to
explain after a while.


There are other benefits to keeping a Traveller band
hungry. One is the fact that adventures sometimes write
themselves as the Travellers decide to go in search
of a necessary component or make a risky trade run
to raise money fast. It is also much easier to keep the
typical ‘five guys in a free trader’ Traveller group from
bypassing the plotline than it is when the ‘five guys’
command 1,000 mercenaries each and have a small
fleet of warships at their disposal.


It is certainly possible (even desirable at times) to run
a campaign at this level but the atmosphere of such a
game will differ from the typical Traveller adventure.


BUILDING A TRAVELLER UNIVERSE
Building an entire universe can be a daunting
prospect. Understanding the principles upon which
the Traveller Core Rulebook is based can help
in making some basic assumptions. Even if you
intend to deviate from how things are usually done
in Traveller, knowing the foundations they are built
upon will enable you to make informed choices.


Traveller provides a means to create an internally
consistent universe for one purpose only – to
facilitate gaming entertainment. They are not a
precise reflection of astrophysical theory as we
understand it today and they sometimes throw up
anomalous results. The Referee is free to tweak,
adjust or ‘fix’ the raw data created by the rules as
much as necessary to suit the needs of his universe
but creative explanations for oddball results can
bring a sense of wonder to a campaign. It is all down
to Traveller and Referee preference.


For the most part, Traveller uses metric measurements
such as seconds, metres and kilometres. However,
other measurements are convenient for other purposes
or have been influential due to their use in older
editions of the game. When determining the size of a
planet, for example, its Size code corresponds to the
world’s diameter in thousands of miles (i.e. Code 6 =
6,000 mile diameter, or roughly 9,600 kilometres).

The standard year in Traveller is based on the [[Terra|Terran]]
year; i.e. 365 days. Named months are rarely used;
instead, the day of the year is used as the date, with
Day 1 being equivalent to the 1st of January and
Christmas Day being Day 358. Dates are usually given
in the format Day-Year, e.g. 056-1111 is the 56th day of
the year 1111 since the Third Imperium was founded.


Weeks, of seven days, are important mainly in
terms of local and shipboard time. Each day has
a name: Oneday, Twoday, and so on. There is no
overall significance to any given day but many local
cultures have special or holy days. These might be
fixed (e.g. Day 22 of each year), semi-fixed (e.g. the
seventh Fiveday of the year) or may vary (e.g. the
Emperor’s Birthday).


One week (168 hours) is the baseline time for a
single starship jump, although actual duration varies
by slightly more than a day and a half each way in
a normal jump and more in the case of a misjump.
Many starship crews work on a two-week cycle; the
time taken to leave port, manoeuvre to the jump point,
jump to a new destination, manoeuvre to land and
then spend a few days in port conducting business
(and just getting out of the ship for a while!), tends to
be around two weeks.


Most commercial starships make two jumps in a
four-week period. For whatever reason (probably
because on a fixed two-world trade route, two jumps
is there-and-back), most starships work on a monthly
accounting period, paying crew and calculating
expenses each month. This is one of the few uses of
the month in Traveller and, of course, one ship’s month
may not be the same as another’s.


Distances between star systems are measured in
parsecs. Parsec is a contraction of Parallax Second,
a name determined from the mathematical/scientific
method used to define it and corresponds roughly
to 3.26 light years. In other words, a parsec is the
distance a radio message, a photon, or other lightspeed
phenomenon would travel in 3.26 years. Starship jump
drives are capable of covering one to six parsecs per
jump (depending on the drive type). Star maps are laid
out in one-parsec hexes, some of which contain star
systems. Other hexes have no system but may not
actually be empty. Rogue planets, comets and other
objects may lie between star systems, although finding
them in a vast area of empty space is problematic (see
The Great Rift box set for this type of exploration).


Star systems are not all neatly spaced at one-parsec
intervals apart but jumps within a certain distance use
the same amount of fuel so it does not really matter to
a jump-capable ship whether two systems are 3.44 or
2.96 light years apart; the journey requires a jump-1
engine and a jump-1 worth of fuel in either case.


The actual distance between star systems would
matter for a non-jump capable ship travelling between
them but this is very rarely done due to the immense
time taken to get anywhere. Indeed, the jump drive
is often used for in-system jumps (sometimes called
microjumps) where the time required to cover
the distance in real space is longer than a week.
Microjumps need a jump-1 engine and use a jump-1
worth of fuel, as fractional jump drives have never been
invented and may not be possible. Likewise, other than
in the case of misjumps (which are dangerous and not
predictable), it is not possible to cover more than six
parsecs in one jump in a standard Traveller universe.

CREATING HUMAN AND


ALIEN SOCIETIES
To be plausible, a society must make sense when
viewed from its own perspective. The rules governing
a society may be complex to the point of being
incomprehensible but they must be consistent.
Weirdness for its own sake quickly becomes
unbelievable and makes it difficult for the Travellers to
make useful deductions or informed choices. To put
that another way; everything happens for a reason,
even if that reason makes no sense to outsiders.


This does not mean that variation cannot exist. Quite
the opposite, in fact. Even within a major interstellar
empire, cultural values and Tech Levels may vary
considerably. There are all manner of reasons why this
might be but the commonest is simple economics. A
world that has a small population and little industrial
base cannot trade for the high-tech goods it needs to
improve its Tech Level and there is little incentive for
others to invest in bettering the lot of a backward planet.


So within a few parsecs of one another, there might
be a number of very low-technology worlds and
several high-tech ones, with others in between.
Technology is often a mix of local and whatever
higher-tech imports can be afforded and kept
running. It is not uncommon to see steam trains or
internal-combustion cars operating alongside the
grav vehicles and starships of a rich elite.

114

###### Refereeing Traveller


Unless a world is isolated, its inhabitants will usually
try to obtain offworld high-technology goods. This
creates markets for other worlds; a steam-powered
civilisation will neither be able to afford nor maintain
high-technology systems but a mid-tech world may
find the lower-tech society a useful market for its more
modest exported goods.

As well as toys and comforts for the elite, higher-tech
imports are generally considered desirable in the
military, commercial and industrial sectors. Even if a
world is not actively trying to improve its technological
base, as a rule higher-tech machinery represents
a good commercial investment so long as it can be
maintained and supported.

Even in the case where there is little offworld
technology available, items will usually be
recognised for what they are, at least in general
terms. Outback savages might not understand what
a laser rifle is but a citizen of even a pre-gunpowder
society will recognise one as being a weapon. It is
not uncommon to encounter local attempts to copy
higher-tech items although the results are usually
crude and bulky, albeit sometimes effective.

Technological sophistication does not necessarily
lead to a particular type of society. A group of people
struggling to scrape a living (whether with fusion-
powered tractors or by gathering berries to take back to
the cave) cannot manage a sophisticated social order,
but once the basic needs of survival are met people will
evolve whatever system works for them.

There are many different government types in Traveller,
including corporate setups, tribal associations,
dictatorships, bureaucracies and democracies of
various kinds. However, two ‘impersonal bureaucracies’
are not necessarily alike. The basic means of
government will be much the same but the actual
society might be very different. One might have a
king as a figurehead, with the real power lying with
his administrators. Another might be the obvious
strangulous red-tape ridden monster and yet another
might be a frontier society where the only governmental
structure is a colonial land claims registry service.

Historical or might-have-been [[Terra|Terran]] societies can be
used as a source of inspiration for worlds in Traveller
but this can be taken too far. If an alien society looks
exactly like ancient China or some kind of techno-
Mayan civilisation, Travellers might wonder why there


are such direct cultural parallels. However, the idea of
a corporate government might be inspired by British,
French or Dutch commercial holdings in India and
the Far East during the Colonial period. An Imperial
power might be inspired by 1807-era France but if the
uniforms are exactly the same as worn in Napoleon’s
time this will detract from the believability of the setting.


Similarly, direct historical parallels are not a good
idea. It might be that the main power in a game does
resemble 1880s Prussia, and there might be a great
trading empire which looks somewhat like Imperial
Britain nearby, but this in no way implies that the
equivalent of the First World War must occur.


Once the general parameters of a society are
established, the Referee needs to ensure it is internally
consistent and that it fits with the rest of the universe.
A great trading empire needs someone to trade with;
highly militarised societies get that way for a reason. Is
the threat internal or external? Current or traditional?
Is the society expanding or declining? Does the
government enjoy popular support?


Working through questions such as these will lead
to a consistent and believable society that might well
be wondrous, amazing or even incomprehensible to
outsiders, but which obeys its own laws of internal
consistency. Wonder has its place in Traveller, as do
oddball societies that should not work or just do not
make sense. However, weird-for-weird’s-sake should
be avoided in the interest of believability.


In short, the Referee can draw on [[Terra|Terran]] societies
for inspiration but must remember that this is the Far
Future, not a parallel of history. The setting must be
internally consistent and make sense; it does not have
to fit a particular model or paradigm.


MULTIWORLD EMPIRES
Multiworld empires have a problem in Traveller, the
same one that faced Earth’s great powers before radio

- communications lag. Messages to central authority
can move only at the speed of a jumping starship.
Even if the capital is just one parsec away, requesting
instructions and receiving them is going to take three or
four weeks by the time a message goes each way and
the situation has been analysed. As distance increases
this becomes even more of a problem.


115

###### Refereeing Traveller


TRAVELLER


The solution to this problem is to devolve authority
upon trusted subordinates while maintaining as fast
a communications system as possible. The upshot of
this is that successful interstellar polities tend to be
either very compact or decentralised. In either case,
an interstellar polity will maintain some kind of courier
or communications service and will invest power
carefully. Maintaining a proper balance between local
governors being sufficiently powerful to deal with a
given situation, without becoming capable of breaking
away or overthrowing the central authority, is a constant
problem for an interstellar society.


The usual solution is to have some kind of government
at world or star system level, then subsequent layers
of authority creating regional groupings. If each of
these groups has sufficient resources to deal with its
own problems and central authority retains sufficient
power to crush dissent or deal with a large-scale
disaster, then the society should be capable of
functioning over a long period. The reality may prove
rather different, however, as politics and economics
pull the structure of society this way and that.


CREATING ADVENTURES
Traveller adventures can be very varied. A band of
Travellers might thwart a planetary invasion one week
and spend the next battling red tape to free their cargo
from the clutches of the Port Authority’s legal division.
Some situations can be resolved by negotiation and
interpersonal skills; others require the application of
guns and gadgets. The important thing is that the
Travellers and Referee enjoy the experience, and that
the game does not become stale and samey.


This is not to say that the setting needs to be liberally
sprinkled with alien artefacts and grand threats to the
cosmic order of things. Indeed, it is best if most of the
universe is relatively stable, in order to provide contrast
for more unusual elements.


Stable does not equate to boring. To a Traveller from
a high-tech world, grav vehicles, floating cities and
rubbing shoulders with alien beings in the shopping
mall may seem quite mundane, but a good Referee
can still make these things interesting. Being suddenly
in shadow because an entire city is passing overhead
might remind the Travellers that even the relatively
mundane can be wondrous.


The Referee can do a lot with details of the setting to
make things interesting. Planetary ecosystems can be
strange without being actively hostile to the Travellers;
a vacuum landscape lit by dim stars provides a great
backdrop. Adventures that take place in interesting
regions tend to be more memorable.


However, it is people (of all kinds – humans and
aliens) that really make a setting come alive. Some
human cultures are stranger than many aliens and
the mix of high and low technology encountered in
starport bazaars or frontier colonies may well throw the
Travellers a curve ball. The actions of every person
in the setting will make sense from some perspective
but the Travellers may not understand them, which
may make their actions incomprehensible. This is fine
so long as these people remain true to themselves,
however weird they may seem to an observer.


Internal consistency is vital to a good universe.
Certain ‘handwaves’ – for example the existence
of a working faster-than-light drive – are necessary
to a good science fiction setting but they must
remain consistent. If there is no means of sending a
message to another star system faster than a courier
ship then this must always be true. It may suit the
plot for the Travellers to be able to send a distress
call and get help in hours but this would represent
a change in the universe’s fundamental rules. Such
changes must be approached with care to avoid
distorting the universe unrecognisably.


Conflict is an integral part of any story and therefore
has its place in Traveller. Conflict does not necessarily
mean combat, although the occasional animal attack,
brawl or full-on gunfight can be fun and is an excellent
finale to an adventure.


Conflict can also take the form of clashing business
interests, legal or bureaucratic harassment, non-violent
arguments, a struggle against the elements, or a race
against time, and all manner of other difficulties. Not all
problems can be fought through or blasted with heavy
weapons and a good campaign contains varied threats,
setbacks and hazards.


When combat does occur, this should be for a good
reason. Even the dumbest and most aggressive
animals will flee if overmatched or badly hurt. People
will try to even the odds by use of superior weapons or
tactics, and will withdraw, surrender or negotiate if this
suits their interests. In short, people, like the universe
in general, obey a set of sensible rules. Random
encounter tables and reaction charts should always be
tempered by the Referee’s common sense.

**ADVENTURE THEMES**
The adventure themes presented here can be used
as a quick-start for an impromptu game session,
or when the Travellers decide to deviate from the
expected path. Each can be embellished to create a
myriad of possibilities.

Exploration: The Travellers need to explore unknown
territory, either to find something they need or for
the sake of scientific discovery. Perhaps they are
investigating ancient temples in the deep jungle or on
a frontier world, or diving into the thick atmosphere of
a gas giant. An exploration adventure can go almost
anywhere, with the Travellers facing dangers in seedy
backwater ports or from things better left undisturbed.

Trade Run: Travelling from one world to the next
while engaging in speculative trade is a staple of
many Traveller campaigns which throw up unexpected
adventure opportunities. Perhaps the cargo is not what
it seems, or the Travellers become aware of a great
opportunity they must rush to exploit. Rivalries with
other traders can explode into violence, or a rival might
come to the Travellers with a proposal that sounds just
a little too good to be true.

**Magnificent Starfarers:** The Travellers are asked to
help a group of people against a powerful enemy, which
might be a horde of dumb ‘monsters’, an invading army
or criminal gang. This does not have to be a straight
fight; the Travellers might teach the locals how to defeat
or evade their enemy, or might play out a romantic
comedy in a field hospital as the battle unfolds around
them. The story might begin after the locals’ defeat,
as the Travellers lead the survivors on a dangerous
overland trek to safety.

Hostage Situation: The Travellers become entangled
in a hostage situation as terrorists or desperate
criminals try to escape capture or bargain for
something they want. The Travellers might be among
the hostages or in a position to try to rescue them. It is
even possible that they might be the hostage-takers,
perhaps without intending to be.

Disaster: Some disaster strikes just as the Travellers
are passing through or in port to conduct trade. The
nature of the disaster can be almost anything – fire,
flood, volcano, earthquake, starship crash or anything
else that upsets the natural order of things. Sealed
environments are good settings for such an adventure,
such as arcologies or orbital ports, creating a pressure-
cooker environment. Often desperate people are as
much a threat as the lava, floodwater or plague.


Heist: The Travellers need to remove something
valuable from its current location and deliver it to
someone else, or perhaps escape with it for their own
use. The job might be entirely illegal, such as a bank or
train robbery, or might be illegal but morally acceptable,
such as the liberation of a hoard of gold bullion from
a corrupt planetary dictator. A heist adventure should
be set up such that a head-on attack is impracticable,
forcing the Travellers to take a less direct approach. it
will typically involve information gathering, misdirection
and stealth, although it could lead to an A to B situation.


A to B: Travelling from one place to another overland
is usually straightforward but sometimes the journey
is the adventure. The Travellers may have to drive a
long way in an ATV, or perhaps they become marooned
and need to reach help. Matters can be complicated
by limiting the equipment available and/or giving
them wounded or helpless companions to look after.
Crossing 600 miles of hostile wilderness in a well-
equipped ATV is one thing. Getting back with a dozen
civilians (including children) in tow, with little food and
one handgun (with three rounds left) between the entire
team is rather more of a challenge. Overland treks can
lead the Travellers into incidents and adventures along
the way. They may find ruins, people who need help,
natural hazards, hostile animals (or people)... the list is
endless. An A to B adventure can also take the form of
a pursuit, with the Travellers being chased or chasing
someone... or both.


Breach of Contract: The Travellers are part of, or
associated with, a mercenary unit hired for what
seems like a straightforward job – until it goes
spectacularly awry. Perhaps the mercenaries’ backer
pulls out and leaves them in hostile territory. Perhaps
some of the mercenaries go rogue, or perhaps it
becomes obvious the mercenaries have chosen the
wrong side and are acting as bully-boys for a corrupt
government. Getting out of the situation with their
skin and reputation intact will require the Travellers to
think beyond simple gunplay.


Distress Signal: The Travellers respond to a GK
(distress) signal. It may come from a community
threatened by natural disaster, a crippled free trader, a
starport under pirate attack, or a lone person lost in the
wilderness. The rescue might require a descent into a
gas giant to haul out a trader crew, landing a starship
atop a burning oil platform to take off the survivors,
or all manner of unusual situations. Often the reward
for success is small in financial terms but sometimes
a rescued person knows something important or may
become a valuable friend.


117

###### Refereeing Traveller


TRAVELLER


Precious Cargo: Occasionally, Travellers will be
stuck with a precious but fragile object. For example,
during a hurried evacuation of an orbital station, the
Travellers find themselves sharing an escape pod with
a six-month-old baby or priceless vase belonging to the
sector duke. Delivering the precious cargo to its rightful
destination can be the focus of the adventure or an
additional complication in a different situation.


Creeping Horror: Space has plenty of frightening
unknowns, making a horror style adventure a
possibility. Since Traveller is a hard-science game,
the Travellers will be predisposed to believe there is a
rational (if strange) explanation for it all. Perhaps there
is but even the rational can be terrifying. Maybe a mad
crewman, or a dangerous alien animal, is stalking the
ship, or the ship’s security system is malfunctioning.
Perhaps there is something stranger going on. Psionic
ghosts, jumpspace entities and even supernatural
beings are a possibility. Whatever the actual threat, this
kind of scenario is best played for tension, suspense
and doubt on the part of the Travellers.


Playing Politics: The court of a powerful noble or
social circles of an advanced world can be a unique
adventure environment every bit as dangerous as
a war-torn frontier world. The Travellers may have
to thread their way through the intrigue of the court
whilst trying not to commit too many gaffes during
unfamiliar activities – formal dinners, parties, hunting
and the like. A straightforward approach might simply
not be possible, even if the Travellers can figure out
who their enemy really is.


The Mystery: Mystery situations can run for a long
time in the background of other adventures, with the
Travellers collecting odd snippets of information as
they do other things, finally leading to a big revelation.
Examples include the search for a lost naval courier,
whose final resting place is revealed only after a great
deal of investigation, or an attempt to find a psionics
institute willing to train the Travellers.

118

###### Refereeing Traveller


War Zone: Military situations make a good backdrop
to adventures even if warfighting is not the focus of
the campaign. Whilst the occasional straight battle
can be an interesting change of pace – especially
if the Travellers are bound by rules of engagement
or enmeshed in a complex political situation, war
zone adventures do not have to be straight firefights.
The most interesting situations are those where the
Travellers have wholly inadequate resources, or
where a straight fight is an option but there is a way
to avoid open war.

Revenge: The quest for vengeance can be a self-
fuelling adventure plot, in which the Travellers
themselves create adventure leads with no thought
for reward. This might be due to the Travellers’
backstory but the best revenge plots are based on
events in an earlier adventure.

ENCOURAGING HEROIC BEHAVIOUR
The Travellers should have a reason to do whatever
the adventure requires. The promise of reward is
one way to motivate the Travellers but is best used
when they are ‘hungry’ and in need of money. In
other words, an offer of Credits is more meaningful
when it translates to being able to get something
the Travellers need rather than simply sitting in their
investment portfolio. Giving out too much money
results in ‘bloat’ and basing too many adventures on
financial reward becomes boring after a while.

As a rule Traveller works best when the Travellers
are heroes. Reluctant heroes, dark heroes or flawed
heroes, maybe, but heroes nonetheless. A campaign
in which the Travellers are motivated only by financial
gain is severely limited, since the Referee must
contrive ways to get them involved and the options
are limited. The patron with a handful of Credits
becomes clichéd very quickly and Travellers who
shrug and walk away from the desperate villagers

- or take time out for a quick pillage and slaughter –
make for a poor game experience.


On the other hand, if the Referee can rely on the
Travellers to (perhaps grudgingly) do what they
think is right, he can drop them into all manner of
adventures for little gain. Why should the Travellers
comply? For one thing, it makes for a better and
deeper game if they have some form of motivation.
For another, the balance of the campaign is better
preserved if the Travellers do not obtain thousands of
Credits for everything they do. In any case, it is the
adventure that makes the game fun, not the fact that
the Travellers gained thousands of Credits.


The Referee can do a certain amount to encourage
Traveller cooperation with this ideal. The most
obvious rewards (other than cash, gear and
advancement) are medals and similar accolades
from authority but there are other ways for a Referee
to reward heroism. Examples of hero-rewards include
the Travellers seeing themselves on TV, or being
invited to discuss their adventures on a chat show.
Meeting people who recognise and respect them as
heroes is also a powerful reward.


‘Good guys’ should get the occasional lucky break,
like help from a rival band of adventurers or local
security forces who are impressed by their reputation
for good deeds. Even little things like being given a
priority docking slot at the starport, or an invitation
to dinner with a local personality or the captain of a
navy ship, will serve to remind heroic Travellers that
they are someone special. When they buy a burger
and get free action figures of themselves, they will
know they have really arrived!


Overall, then, Traveller works best if the Travellers are
some sort of heroes rather than cynical advancement-
machines. A smart Referee encourages this by
rewarding heroes... and the greatest reward of all is
to be treated as a hero. Not everywhere, perhaps, but
from time-to-time something should happen to make
it all worthwhile. And when just afterward, another
situation erupts... no real hero could possibly refuse
the call to adventure!

# I NTERPRETING UWP DATA

The Universal World Profile allows a great deal of
information to be presented in a very compact form.
However, like all attempts to be concise, it requires
generalisation. It is easy to read off the code and
assume every world with a given Atmosphere code or
Law Level will be exactly the same, but this is a misuse
of the UWP. It is not intended to detail exactly a world
and its society down to the last nuance but instead is
meant to be a starting point for the Referee’s creativity.

Some inferences can be made from the UWP,
particularly about the physical characteristics of a
world, but beyond this there is room for considerable
variation – one B687484-9 world is not necessarily like
another. That said, the UWP is invaluable when the
Travellers decide to suddenly veer off the adventure
path and land at some backwater world the Referee
has not yet written up. The vanilla-flavour interpretation
of the UWP can be used when there is no time or need
for anything more detailed. Indeed, sometimes only
part of the UWP will be needed.

Often, Travellers are only interested in the starport.
If they visit a highport – perhaps to trade or buy stuff
with the payoff of their last mission – then typically
it will not matter what sort of world it orbits. The
planet in this case is little more than scenery but the
UWP allows the Referee to present the right colour
of scenery. If the Travellers land planetside, then
the question of whether they can wander around in
the open air or must stay inside a sealed structure
becomes important. Further detail is needed when the
Travellers actually go outside the starport.

THE THREE HS
Travellers as a rule are not unduly concerned with
precise details and will typically classify worlds as one
of the ‘three Hs’ – Habitable, Hazard and Hostile. Often
this is all the Referee or Travellers will need to know,
especially if the visit is a short one.


Habitable is shorthand for ‘fairly to very welcoming,
with breathable air and enough water to support
vegetation’. To qualify as Habitable, a world must be
‘liveable without too much effort’. Planets with plenty
of water and greenery may still be considered Hazard
worlds if they have severe weather, unpleasant
temperatures, serious atmospheric taints or other
factors that make them less pleasant than the
UWP code might suggest. Those that are more or
less habitable but have factors requiring caution or
equipment like a filter mask are sometimes classified
as ‘Borderline’ rather than Hazard.


Hazard has various degrees of meaning, ranging from
a near-habitable world to one with an unbreathable
atmosphere and significant natural hazards such as
volcanoes or meteor showers. The majority of worlds
fall somewhere in this category and as a result many
Travellers invent sub-classifications. The commonest
of these are Rockballs, Exotic worlds, Tainted worlds,
Desert worlds and Water worlds.


Hostile worlds are ‘out to get you’, in the sense that
there is serious threat to life. This can be obvious,
such as a corrosive atmosphere, or more insidious.
Examples include apparently habitable worlds where
the entire ecosystem wants to kill and eat visitors or
where certain diseases are endemic.


The ‘3 Hs’ can be helpful to the Referee in deciding on
an adventure. If the Travellers are to be running around
unhindered in the countryside, the adventure needs to
be set on a Habitable or perhaps minor Hazard world.
One set on a Hostile planet will require more equipment
and there are some encounters that simply cannot
occur in this environment. In some cases, such as one-
off adventures, the Referee might decide which H is
required and then assign a UWP code to create one.

GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS
The Travellers’ first impressions of a world are
usually determined by the Atmosphere code, with
Size and Hydrographics playing a smaller part. Upon
closer approach, settlement patterns will be noted.
These factors create the general characteristics of
the world, summed up by Travellers as ‘what’s it like
and who lives here?’

**EXOTIC WORLDS**
Exotic worlds tend to be settled in order to exploit
resources rather than because anyone wants to live
there. They typically require specialist life support
equipment, which pushes people into larger and
more centralised settlements. Most Exotic worlds
are obviously different to the norm, such as a large,
high-gravity planet which has no atmosphere or one
whose atmospheric composition is highly unusual.
Life on an Exotic world tends to be very strange to
humans, although creatures may not be inimical.
Exotic worlds tend to fall into the Hazard category,
although sometimes they are dangerous enough to
be considered Hostile.

**HABITABLE WORLDS**
To qualify as Habitable, a world requires a Thin,
Standard or Dense atmosphere (code 5,7 or 8) and
sufficient water to support a diverse ecosystem

- Hydrographics code 3–9. This alone does not
necessarily indicate a ‘garden world’; there may be
other factors that make it less than attractive as a
home. Those most suitable for settlement are called
Habitable by Travellers, although the term is used in a
wider sense by surveying agencies to mean any world
that can support sentient life.

Habitable worlds typically look the part, with vibrant
blues and greens of water and vegetation, with an
amount of clouds indicated by the Hydrographics
code. Borderline worlds with an atmospheric taint
may look much the same, although many taints
discolour the atmosphere.


They may show a tight settlement pattern but those
with an indigenous population or where settlers
have had time to spread out will tend to have more
dispersed and random population groupings. There
is little to prevent small groups from heading into
unclaimed territory and creating a town, unless
colonial development is strictly controlled. As a result,
Habitable worlds tend to have a group of major cities
with fringe areas between them, in which society and
available technology can vary considerably. There is
also the possibility of indigenous societies or races,
splinter groups and the like.


Habitable worlds are by far the most diverse in terms
of culture and technology. Easy living conditions
and local food mean Habitable worlds are the most
desirable for settlement. No reason is needed beyond
‘a good place to live’. One consequence of this is
that secondary colonisation often takes place when a
Habitable world is opened up. The main colonial effort
may be well-funded and lead to carefully planned cities
but secondary landgrabs may be much less organised.
It is not uncommon to find Habitable worlds with a
central city culture that is quite different from that of the
outback homesteads. In extreme cases, the capital/
starport and the rest of the planet might as well be in
different star systems, so different are their societies.


HAZARD WORLDS
Hazard worlds vary considerably, although their nature
is often obvious on approach. Planets characterised
by desert, covered in icefields or water will typically
be identifiable ‘by eye’, as can the presence of some
atmospheric taints. The severity of a taint will determine
whether Travellers consider the place borderline
Habitable or a Hazard world.


Hazards can have variable effects on a world’s
settlement pattern. Atmospheric taints, unless very
serious, tend not to influence settlement too much.
People will spread out just as readily as they do on
Habitable planets, providing the taint can be handled
with simple measures such as masks and sealed
dwellings. Other hazards tend to concentrate people
either where they can live most easily or where life
support can be readily provided.

Thus on a water world, people will tend to group on
islands or in seabed cities – building a small settlement
in deep water is prohibitively expensive. If natural
conditions that can be exploited, such as rafts of
seaweed, then low-tech colonies at sea are possible.
If not, the only inhabitants will be on land. The same
goes for worlds with extremely dense atmospheres
that can only be breathed unaided at high altitude,
creating ‘islands’ atop high ground, and low-pressure
worlds where deep canyons can be inhabited without
advanced equipment. It is quite possible that two
separate cultures may develop, with low-tech people
living where they can and high-tech cities built where
their inhabitants choose, such as atop resource sites.


HOSTILE WORLDS
Hostile worlds do not always look the part.
Occasionally an apparently green and pleasant
land hides an ecological deathtrap. However, more
commonly Hostile worlds show it. Corrosive or toxic
atmospheres tend to be obvious, with ominous clouds
which may be thick above a twisted landscape. If
the atmosphere is thick enough, there may be life on
a Hostile world but it will not be familiar. Creatures
evolved to breathe toxic gases and survive a corrosive
atmosphere tend to be simple forms of life – although
there are exceptions – and extremely tough.


Settlement on Hostile worlds tends to be centralised,
largely due to the expense of providing protection
against the environment and the ability to deal with
failures. Low-tech (and possibly mid-tech) societies
cannot survive on such a world without significant
outside assistance. The existence of one suggests
either an indigenous people or a colony that cannot
maintain high technology but has received it in the past.
One example is a colony that has recently been cut
off, or a settlement damaged by conflict. Either way,
the population’s days are numbered unless they can
secure outside assistance by some means.


ROCKBALLS
Worlds with an Atmosphere code of 0–3 are typically
referred to as Rockballs by Travellers, although some
use the term only for worlds with a trace atmosphere
or less. Rockball worlds tend to have a landscape
similar to Earth’s moon, with many impact craters
and little or no erosion. Those close enough to a star
to receive significant light will have harsh contrasts


between light and dark. Standing water is virtually
impossible on an Atmosphere 0–1 world, although
ice can be found in areas that do not receive direct
light. Worlds with a very thin atmosphere may have
some water and even life, although commonly this
is primitive. Most Rockball worlds would qualify as
Hazard; it is rare for one to be actively Hostile since
this requires conditions unlikely to exist.


Settling a Rockball world requires a reason and
sufficient technology to support the population. The
two common reasons for establishing a colony on an
uninviting world are resources and territorial control.
In the latter case, a settlement may have been
established simply to claim ownership of a world or
facilitate the construction of a starport which would in
turn support and profit from passing interstellar trade.
Typically, such colonies are centralised, with the entire
population living close to the starport.


Where a world was settled for its resources, the
population may be more spread out if dispersed
extraction sites are located. A larger population typically
indicates that some or even most of the mining and
extraction settlements developed industry, growing
into cities rather than large workplaces. Either way,
the settlement pattern on a Rockball world tends to
be a smaller number of relatively large concentrations
rather than a sprawl of low-population homesteads, due
to the expense and difficulty of providing life-support
equipment for a thinly spread population; concentration
is simply more cost-efficient.


TECHNOLOGY DISTRIBUTION
The Tech Level of a world indicates the best
technology locally available, although this is open to
some interpretation. Maintaining a high-technology
base requires a great deal of effort and industry, and
is simply not possible with the local resources of a
low-population frontier world. If such a world has a
high Tech Level then chances are it is supplied with
imported equipment provided by an offworld benefactor.
This might be a colony owner, or group supporting
an outpost. There is the possibility that the locals are
somehow producing high-tech equipment themselves
but that would be an intriguing oddity. The Travellers
might well want to investigate...

122

###### Interpreting UWP Data


Well-established cultures tend to have uniform
technology distribution, at least throughout the major
population centres. If a world can cheaply produce
TL9 goods there is little point in trying to sell TL7 items
in the shops of the capital. However, on less well
developed worlds or in regions away from the cities,
folks make do with simple mechanical devices and the
odd imported must-have.

The Tech Level of a world is best thought of as ‘this is
what you can buy in the starport shops and main cities’.
This technology will trickle out into the countryside
but since the infrastructure to support it may not exist,
its life span will be limited. It is not uncommon to
encounter hybrid technologies in the fringe and outback
regions, with what are essentially mid-tech railroads
connecting high-tech cities. Some trains are pulled
by advanced fusion-powered locomotives; most use
simpler petrochemical-fuelled versions.


Technology mix can be quite extreme, with animal-
drawn carts sharing streets of frontier towns with
grav vehicles, or local officials using high-tech hand
computers as light sources when candles burn
out. A good rule of thumb is that older, more stable
societies have an even distribution of technology
right up to the fringes, whilst newer colonies or
worlds with a troubled history have to make do with
whatever the locals can get.


The general characteristics of a world tend to determine
its settlement pattern, which in turn influences
technology distribution and economy. A major industrial
base requires population concentrations or enormous
automation; more scattered communities can make
advanced items only on a cottage-industry base, if at
all. The critical point for a significant planetary economy

- one that is relevant on the interstellar scale – is
Population code 7 (tens of millions), assuming most of
this population is grouped into fairly large cities.


123

###### Interpreting UWP Data


TRAVELLER


Increasing Tech Level and Population tends to also
imply more infrastructure. Cities need to be linked by
heavy goods transportation and efficient passenger
services. Roads, waterways and skies will become
more crowded as Tech Level increases. High Law
Levels might imply restrictions on travel or heavy
environmental protection which limits the use of
transportation outside the cities.


The kind of transportation used will change the flavour
of a world. As a rule, mass transport and heavy goods
movement are based on cost-efficiency rather than
technical capability, so even an advanced world might
have railroads and seagoing ships plying between its
cities. However, gravitic technology is likely to push out
other forms of transportation sooner or later. A high-
tech world (TL10 or above) might use orbital craft to
move cargo between the orbital port and downports at
the major cities, with no need for roads or other ground
links between them. Within cities there may be light
ground vehicles in use but a world that has had grav
technology for a long time will have a very different
infrastructure pattern to one that is just developing it.


FLESHING OUT A WORLD
The Referee can run through a simple process when
fleshing out a world for a brief visit or long adventure.
This process begins with the general characteristics of
the planet itself, then proceeds to habitation patterns
based on population size, distribution and Tech Level.
The general outline of a world’s population distribution
and habitation pattern tends to become obvious
even from orbit. Concentrations of lights on the night
side indicate cities, with agricultural areas standing
out from wilderness by their colour and regularity of
borders. However, this may not always be the case.
Mid-tech and the lower end of high-tech societies tend
to be very obvious but at very high Tech Levels cities
may blend into the scenery and be less obvious. Few
cultures deliberately hide cities but this is possible
once technology reaches the point where self-
contained settlements are possible or where a culture
chooses to live underground.


Economic and technical factors tend to influence
population and industrial distribution, with social and
cultural matters both exerting influence and receiving
it. Worlds colonised in the past few hundred years
tend to have cities grouped relatively close together,
whereas those whose society developed there or which


have regressed and rebuilt usually show a more even
distribution. It is not uncommon for a ‘developed’ world
to have huge areas of wilderness which are virtually
uninhabited, with the population grouped into a cluster
of cities or even a single one. Most inhabitants will tend
to forget about the rest of the planet; only Travellers
may have reason to go there.


There are always exceptions, of course. Most are
minor but the Referee can always create a unique
interpretation of the UWP code that does not fit the
usual pattern. For the most part, however, the UWP can
be extrapolated using common sense and a guideline
put forward by Traveller’s creator, Marc Miller himself:
‘everything is driven by economics’. In other words,
society will develop in a manner driven by what can be
afforded balanced against what is needed. People will
gather where there are jobs and industry will develop
where there are people.


Deviations from this typically happen for cultural or
social reasons. People might establish an inefficient or
cost-ineffective settlement at a holy site or just to be
away from those they dislike but there will always be a
reason why the simplest and least expensive approach
was not used. Once extensive resources are available,
grand projects might be undertaken for the sake of ego
or prestige, or perhaps reasons of comfort. There will
still usually be an economic factor, however.


For example, it is easier to build cities on level ground
than on the seabed or a mountainside, and flying grav-
supported cities are vastly expensive. They might be
built for reasons of prestige, showcasing the world’s
technical abilities or political importance, but there must
be some benefit to doing it this way or else the money
will be spent on simpler and easier projects.


This principle should be used as a guide when
interpreting the UWP and fleshing out a world – there
needs to be a reason why the world is the way the
Referee is describing. Of course, that reason can be
convoluted and surprising in some cases, leading to a
very odd society. For the most part, however, worlds
will follow the guidelines mentioned above. Those that
do not will pique the Travellers’ interest and prompt
investigation that can lead to unexpected adventures.

### RAVELLERMAP

### AND THE WIKI

Travellermap (travellermap.com) and the Traveller
Wiki (wiki.travellerrpg.com) are excellent resources
but some care is needed when using them. The Wiki
can be edited by any user, which sometimes means
segments of someone’s campaign appear there and
do not fit well with the Third Imperium universe. Even
where a page is listed as ‘canon’ this is not always
entirely accurate – the canon data on a given page may
have been amended and expanded by a user.

For most Referees this will not matter. The data on
the Wiki is a starting point at most and the universe
is malleable to fit with what the Referee needs.
There is no need to slavishly follow the mainstream
universe’s canon if you need something different
for your campaign. If you do decide to use what is
contained in the Wiki, it is worth being aware that two
milieux are supported by it.

The first part of an entry is the ‘classic’ era of Traveller,
the Third Imperium universe, with data correct for
around the year 1105. Many pages also have an entry
for the New Era setting, in which big changes have
occurred in Charted Space. This can cause confusion,
as states and regions often have similar but different
names – an Imperial Navy base might become a
Regency naval base further down the page.

It is also worth noting that the Wiki does not contain
material drawn directly from the current Mongoose
Publishing edition of Traveller, as canon is considered
to be in a state of revision with the most recent books.
In some cases, non-canon entries in the Wiki vary
considerably from the current Third Imperium universe,
although on the whole the two tend to broadly coincide.

Overall, the Traveller Wiki is best used as a source
of ideas and general outline of conditions in the
Third Imperium universe. Those wishing to write for
publication have long been advised to use it as a guide
to what canon materials are available rather than a
repository of that information. The Wiki is an excellent
resource but by its nature is prone to contain at least
some material applicable to a single person’s campaign
rather than the mainstream Third Imperium universe.


CONTRIBUTING TO THE WIKI
The Traveller Wiki is open to contributions from
anyone, although it is overseen by a small staff
who make most of the additions and remove
inappropriate content. Fans are very welcome
to contribute to the game’s background but a
contribution has the best chance of becoming
permanent if it fits well with the existing universe.


Ideal contributions expand logically upon or
extrapolate from existing canon sources. For example,
the automatically generated data page for a given
world could be expanded into a highly detailed writeup
of its physical features, culture and interactions with
another system, but if this data clashes with the official
(canon) information on that system a cleanup will
eventually remove offending sections – Traveller’s
canon always trumps unofficial contributions, no
matter how cool they are!


It is important to avoid universe-changing or universe-
breaking entries. In some cases this is obvious; it
would be clearly inappropriate to add a personality
to the Wiki who shot the Duchess of Mora and led
a revolt that resulted in an independent Spinward
Marches, since this contradicts published sources. It
would, of course, be perfectly all right to do this in your
own campaign (although the duchess might object) but
Wiki entries must reflect the ethos and background of
the Third Imperium universe.


Some universe-breaking changes are less apparent,
at least at first glance. For example, someone
might decide to add a small three world power from
their own campaign to the Wiki. That could be an
excellent addition, happily used by other Referees.
However, it is possible to go overboard without
really intending to. If this power has dozens of highly
capable battleships, questions start to arise. Why is
it not more powerful? How is it crewing these ships
or paying for them? How does this affect the local
balance of power? If the addition alters the universe
too much, it will not be useful.


TRAVELLER


Thus it is important to consider the implications of
any addition to the Wiki. It is tempting to add your
own Traveller’s super-empire and fleet of reactivated
Ancients cruisers but this is an exercise in ego rather
than a useful contribution to the universe. A more
modest insert would be far more likely to survive.
The best approach is to consider whether your
prospective contribution is valuable to just your
campaign, or to everyone’s. Adding personalities,
worlds, corporations and creatures that expand the
Third Imperium universe whilst fitting comfortably
within it benefits all users and represents a worthy
contribution to the Traveller-related body of knowledge.


TRAVELLERMAP
Travellermap is a bold attempt to place the whole
Third Imperium universe online in a readily useable
format, and it succeeds admirably. The system data
is continually being updated, eliminating some rather
fanciful star types and impossible UWP codes. This
work is incomplete as yet but most core regions of the
Third Imperium universe have been updated.


In addition to useful features such as a jump map
showing all destinations within one to six parsecs,
Travellermap presents the UWP code of a world,
with expansion and interpretation available at a click.
The entry for each world links to the wiki page for the
system, which provides further expansion of the data.


However, many entries are automatically generated
from the UWP codes and may not represent the
detailed version presented in Traveller game materials.
There are also some systems that have been expanded
‘unofficially’ and which may not match official canon
publications. The rule of thumb for Travellermap is that
the data on the Travellermap page is the current canon
UWP, star type and so forth, whilst what is presented
in the linked Wiki page may or may not be the canon
expansion of that data depending on who contributed it.


THE GALACTIC MAP
Zooming Travellermap right out brings up a map of
our galaxy. At this scale, Charted Space is little more
than a speck. In other parts of the galaxy there are
named regions, giving intriguing hints to what might
be out there and what could be planned for the future
of Traveller. One of these regions is the home of the
Essaray, a culture of biological robots who feature in
the Fall of Tinath campaign in the Traveller Starter Set.


The galactic map illustrates just how little of the
galaxy has been explored by humans and how much
remains wide open for Referees to create their own
setting far from Charted Space. It is possible that
humans reached distant parts of the galaxy in the
past, perhaps aboard long-range missions sent out
by the Ancients. Their empires could have risen and
fallen in distant pockets of stars without anyone in
Charted Space ever knowing.

126

###### Travellermap and the Wiki


**THE ORION SPUR**
The region known as Charted Space lies within the
Orion Spur of the Sagittarius Arm of the galaxy. It
is sometimes considered an arm in its own right,
although it spans the gap between the Sagittarius
and Perseus Arms.

Charted Space occupies only a small section of the
Orion Spur. It is possible to proceed for thousands of
parsecs to spinward or trailing along the arm before
reaching the end or entering the Sagittarius Arm
proper. To reach the galactic core, as the Zhodani have
attempted, or explore rimward as the Solomani are
said to have done, requires crossing between spiral
arms. This involves a long voyage simply to reach the
edge of the Orion Spur, then a transit of the sparse
region between arms. This region is not completely
devoid of stars; there are large clusters as well as
isolated star systems. Stellar density is low compared
to the region within the spiral arm, making transit
difficult but not impossible.


THE ZHODANI CORE EXPEDITIONS
Travellermap’s zoom feature gives a sense of the scale
of the Third Imperium universe and the amount of effort
that has gone into development over the past decades.
From the major polities of Charted Space it is possible
to trace the route of the Zhodani Core Expeditions. This
narrow strip of mapped territory represents enormous
effort and gives some idea of just how much of the
galaxy is available for Referees to develop.


The Zhodani Core Expeditions terminate at Ikklifl, with
a few systems beyond it explored. This is the absolute
outer limit of human exploration, at least as far as the
people of Charted Space are concerned. The density
of stars in the galactic core is vastly higher than in the
spiral arms. Exploring this region – either in-game or
as a project to develop the universe – would be an
enormous undertaking.

Zooming in on Charted Space reveals an intriguing
fact about its location. There are wide rifts running
right across the Orion Spur, whose only easy crossing
point lies right in the centre of Charted Space. Known
locally as the Great and Lesser Rifts, these interstellar
gaps appear to be parts of the same phenomenon.
Although tiny compared to the vast distances between
spiral arms, these rifts have shaped the development of
interstellar society within Charted Space.


127

###### Travellermap and the Wiki


TRAVELLER


CHARTED SPACE
Against the backdrop of the vast galaxy, the classic
map of Charted Space – first published in early
Traveller supplements decades ago – at first seems
tiny. However, Travellermap’s zoom feature reveals that
Charted Space is in fact huge – just on a different scale
of huge to the galactic map.


Zooming in, the map style changes and veteran
Traveller fans will recognise the map styles used at
different periods in the game’s history. The general
layout of astrographic features, sectors and interstellar
polities is clear at the 30-parsec scale.


At the 10-parsec scale the style changes again and
local details begin to appear. Trade routes and smaller
interstellar polities can be studied, giving the Referee
an idea of the local ‘big picture’.


The five-parsec scale begins to feature individual star
systems, although only in broad strokes.

128

###### Travellermap and the Wiki


The one-parsec scale gives more information and
can be considered the ‘adventure scale’ for Traveller.
Roughly a subsector is presented at this level, showing
starport classes and trade zones. The one-parsec scale
is often used to plan trade runs or chart a route through
the local area while avoiding likely naval patrol zones.

**USING THE MAP SCALES**
Travellermap’s zoom feature can be used equally well
to search for an adventure location or get an idea about
the strategic and economic situation in a system. A
great deal of background information can be inferred
from the different map scales. Is the world in a frontier
system? At an astrographic choke point? Is it isolated
or on a main? How far is the nearest high-population,
high-technology world or naval base?

A system that is very distant from economic
powerhouses and off major trade routes is unlikely
to receive a great deal of trade. Yet if it has a high-
end starport there must be a reason why it was built.
Perhaps the port was part of a failed project to expand
commerce in the region, in which case the port
might be a run-down shadow of its intended glory. Or
perhaps the project is ongoing and the world has a
boom-town atmosphere. No naval base nearby means
less patrols, which in turn suggests a hazardous
system prone to piracy and smuggling.


This is the great advantage of Travellermap. It
allows the Referee to quickly assess the local and
wider situation and acts as a spur to creativity when
something does not quite fit the norm. It also permits
a group of Travellers to plan their route or pick a
destination, and similarly enables the Referee to quickly
see where the Travellers might decide to go next.


STAR SYSTEMS
Zooming in closer than the one-parsec scale adds
the world’s Universal World Profile to the map and
clicking on the hex calls up a box with a link to the
system’s Wiki entry. Once expanded, this box gives
access to additional data.


At this point, the Referee has at his fingertips a
quick reference to the entire star system – number
and type of stars, terrestrial planets and gas giants,
UWP for the mainworld and additional data. Much of
this is presented as codes but expanding the entry
produces an explanation.


129

###### Travellermap and the Wiki


TRAVELLER


From the entry for Imisaa, we find it is a desert world
whose atmosphere is too thin to breathe, with abundant
resources and a population of around 100 million. It is
controlled by an offworld power and has a modest Tech
Level, all of which suggests that Imisaa is a resource-
extraction site rather than a homeworld. It will have some
local industry but the emerging picture is of a mining
colony. The starport is of high quality but may be geared
more towards bulk ore transfers than general traffic.


However, a look at the local map indicates that Imisaa
is part of a large cluster of worlds, which includes its
owner-world, Tobia. With a number of poor quality
starports nearby and trade routes marked as passing
through the system, it seems more likely that Imisaa is
quite an important commercial port. Could this be the
world’s primary source of revenue instead of mining?
Perhaps, although it is possible both are important.
Either way, it seems likely that most profits go to
business owners on Tobia and Imisaa receives only
whatever investment they deem sufficient.


The combination of world and map data allows the
Referee to quickly gain an impression of what a
given world is like. This is particularly useful when the
Travellers decide to veer off the intended path, land at a
wholly unexpected location and start asking questions
about the local culture. The Referee can interpret this
information in other ways and might flesh out Imisaa
quite differently to these first impressions, but for a
Referee in a hurry this method is invaluable.


Further inspection of the map tells us that Imisaa has
a naval base and lies close to the Imperial frontier. The
nearest major power is the Aslan Hierate, separated
by a buffer zone of independent systems unlikely to
pose much threat to the Third Imperium. Thus whilst
the base might be part of a contingency plan for the
nightmare scenario of all-out war with the Hierate, it
is more likely that the base is small and intended to
support patrol assets along the border or into neutral
space. Its facilities will be geared to destroyers and
small patrol or escort vessels, rather than battleships.


The world data contains a link to Imisaa’s Wiki page
but this is at present an automatically generated
placeholder with no information beyond standard
entries derived from the world’s codes.


THE JUMP MAP
Near the bottom of the world’s data box is a row of
links labelled J-1 to J-6. Clicking one of these brings
up a map of all star systems within that many parsecs.
Imisaa’s jump-4 map shows all systems the Travellers
might head to next and might suggest good prospects
for a trade run. The local map can also be used to
quickly determine where a ship is headed or has
arrived from, based on its jump capability and the
quality of local starports.

130

###### Travellermap and the Wiki


**THE WORLD MAP GENERATOR**
Below the jump map is a world map generator, which
produces a map using the traditional ‘triangles and
hexes’ format used in Traveller since its first publication.

The map is a flat representation of a geodesic; if it
were folded together the upper triangles would meet
at the north pole and the lower ones at the south.
Clearly Imisaa is a rather forbidding place, with
terrain composed mainly of deserts, mountains and
deep chasms. Its main features are clearly obvious
and there may be something interesting about that
giant canyon... sometimes adventure ideas are
sparked by symbols on the map and sometimes
Travellers will insist on investigating whether or not
there is actually anything there.


USING THE WORLD BUILDER
The world builder tool is found at the bottom of the
information box in a link named Traveller5 World
Builder. It can be used to expand on known data
about a star system or mainworld, or create one
from scratch. The Referee has control over starting
data and can specify details needed for a particular
adventure, or can use the world builder tool to create
an entirely random star system.


As an example, we might decide to create a random
world. Some data has to be decided upon by the
Referee, starting with its sector location. If a sector
that has already been generated is selected, the world
builder allows the Referee to choose which world to
develop and automatically uses its data.


131

###### Travellermap and the Wiki


TRAVELLER


Since we want a custom world developed from
scratch, we entered 25 Orionis from the menu as
there is no data on the worlds of this sector yet.
We are using the world builder as a tool to create a
custom star system for use wherever we choose, so
the sector location is not really important.


We decide our world will be a fairly low-population
sort of place, located in an extensive star system
with two planetoid belts, three gas giants and 10
other planets. Having entered this basic data, the
Generate World Data button automatically fills in the
rest, giving a UWP of C746668-7.


The generate system tool then produces a complete
star system for us, complete with data on gas giant
moons and all of the many bodies we want in our
system. The Create System Symbol Map produces a
useful graphical reference for this, with moons listed
under each planetary body.


There are tools for altering orbital distances, if that
seems desirable, and bodies in the system can
be named. We imaginatively name the mainworld
Example World and used the Generate Map button to
create a surface map of it.


The world builder tool allows the Referee to
completely generate an entire star system from a
Travellermap hex, with data on planets and satellites
in the system and surface maps of them. This
represents the other end of the scale, which ranges
from a map of the galaxy to one showing the features
of a particular moon in a chosen star system. It is a
powerful tool but perhaps the most important feature
of Travellermap is that the level of detail can be
chosen. Marc Miller, creator of Traveller, sets out
various principles for preparing a game – the idea that
you should Map Only As Really Necessary (MOARN)
is good advice. Tools should assist the game, not
govern it, and should be used when necessary rather
than on every possible occasion.

## TARPORTS

## AND SPACEPORTS

By convention, the most important port in a star
system is designated the starport. This can be
slightly inappropriate, such as when the grandly
named ‘starport’ is actually a marked field with a few
huts nearby, or where a mid-tech world designates
an airport, sea port or railway nexus as its port for
lack of anything better.

The starport code for a world gives a general indication
of the level of service available and also tends to
indicate its size. It is possible to find a very high-quality
but tiny port but this sort of setup is not commercially
viable so it is unlikely to become the system’s main
port even if all larger facilities are of much lower quality.
Thus, whilst the starport is generally thought of as the
‘best’ port in a system, a better term might be ‘most
suitable for general traffic’.

In the Third Imperium universe, starports are
considered to be Imperial territory (at least, within
the Imperium; other cultures have different practices)
whereas spaceports belong to the host government.
This is, however, subject to variation. In most cases,
the highport and downport are both run by a single port
authority, usually a corporate body. Occasionally both
are run by separate organisations whose interactions
can cause problems for visitors.

Certain general characteristics are indicated by the
starport code.

Class A: An ‘A’ code is assigned to excellent-quality
installations, usually with construction yards attached.
The size of a port’s shipyards can vary considerably.
Small-ship construction is commonplace, building
vessels of common types up to 1,000 tons or so.
Some ports can build larger vessels but many such
craft are built at specialist yards. These may or may
not be co-located with a major starport but the facility
will need a port of some kind.

A Class A port can conduct starship overhauls and
modifications, and sells both refined and unrefined
fuel. Class A ports are major trade centres in their
own right and may have offworld goods unavailable
elsewhere on the planet. They usually consist of a
large orbital component (the highport) and a planetary
component (the downport).


The orbital component of a Class A port is often
a large city in space. There may actually be no
downport as such; multiple planetside spaceports
might be served by the central highport. Alternatively,
a large surface facility may also exist. If this is the
case, it will be a major economic hub for the planet
located at or close to the capital.


Where a low-population or economically unimportant
world has a high-end port, this usually indicates the
port was set up to support trade passing along a
nearby route. Often the host world gets a very small
slice of revenue from the port and sometimes none at
all. A Class A or B downport on a low-tech world may
be an island of high-technology culture surrounded
by wilderness or frontier settlements. Relations
between portside and indigenous populations may
not be good. In some cases the downport is a token
settlement, with the highport being essentially a
separate culture in orbit.


Class B: Code B is assigned to large or high-quality
(sometimes but not always both) installations. Ports
serving systems that see a lot of interstellar traffic
usually grow into a Class B installation. To qualify for
this code, a starport must be capable of conducting
maintenance and overhauls, and must have facilities
for refining starship fuel. It will usually have yards
capable of constructing non-starships such as
shuttles and launches. Class B ports are often
important trade centres.


Class B ports must also have at least a reasonably
capable orbital component. As a general rule, the
downport component of a Class B port will see more
traffic than the highport and most ships will either
land at the downport or dock at the highport but
conduct business planetside.


Class C: Code C is assigned to ‘average’ starports,
which can vary considerably. To qualify, a port must
have at least a basic orbital facility, although this might
be nothing more than a docking station with a shuttle
service planetside. Both refined and unrefined fuel
are usually available but starship building facilities
are highly unlikely to be present, and only fairly basic
maintenance or repairs are possible.


TRAVELLER


Class D: Code D is assigned to a very basic port.
A Class D port is almost always a downport with
no orbital component at all. Only unrefined fuel is
available and no repair facilities are on offer; what
facilities there are may be quite primitive.


Class E: Code E indicates what is often termed a
‘frontier installation’. A Class E port can be nothing
more than a ‘usual place to land’ or a known safe
area. There are no facilities as such, although
there might be a settlement close by where ad-hoc
services can be obtained.


Class X: Code X applies to worlds with no port at
all, such as unexplored, interdicted and uninhabited
worlds. Not only are there no port facilities, there is
no guarantee that a landing site will be safe. Ground
subsidence, flooding and other problems can make an
apparently useable site hazardous.


As a general rule of thumb, starports can be considered
to offer the following services.


E: ‘Safe place to land but there might well be
nobody there’.
D: ‘Safe place to land, you can get fuel and supplies'.
C: ‘Fuel, supplies and some skilled maintenance.
Commercial and freighting opportunities for small ships’.
B: ‘High trade volume, skilled maintenance and
repairs, regular passenger and bulk freight services
passing through.’
A: ‘Huge trade volume, shipbuilding. Lots of big ships
coming through on a frequent basis.’


SPACEPORTS
A star system or even a single planet might have
multiple spaceports. Sometimes these vie for
the status of starport, especially on balkanised
worlds that have a number of states clamouring for
interstellar trade. Picking the wrong port on such
a world can result in a very different experience.
Spaceports can be assigned a code, forming a
continuation of the A-E system for starports.


Class F: This is assigned to a high-quality port
capable of handling a large volume of traffic. Class F
spaceports usually have facilities equivalent to a Class
B starport or perhaps a high-end C. A few are as large
and capable as Class A ports and may have additional
facilities such as large shipyards or a naval base.
Class F ports often serve large cities on a planet with a
central starport, or important offworld installations, such
as colonies and the like.


Class G: A G-code is assigned to a basic or fairly poor
spaceport, equivalent to the lower end of Class C or
better than average Class D starports. A Class G port
is likely to be found at a minor city or typical offworld
asset such as a mining base on a gas giant moon.


Class H: An H-code is typically assigned to a very
basic or improvised facility equivalent to a low-end
Class D port, or simply a landing area next to a small or
temporary installation. A scientific outpost with a dozen
personnel, which receives a supply ship once every
three months, would probably have Class H port.


Class Y: Code Y indicates no spaceport is present. The
starport equivalent code, Class X, can also be used.


PORT FEATURES AND EVENTS
Some ports have additional capabilities or different
characteristics to those indicated by the standard
codes. Any of the special types listed can be
implemented at the Referee’s discretion. Alternatively,
when generating a random starport, a special feature
is present on a 2D roll of 8+. The exact feature can be
determined by the Port Features table or chosen by the
Referee. Similarly, an event might be taking place at
the port. Events are less permanent than features and
occur on a 2D roll of 6+.


All of these features are subject to Referee
interpretation or veto. For example, a Class E starport
is not likely to be a major trade nexus, at least not for
interstellar trade. However, it might be a centre for
unusually large amounts of planetside trade.

###### Starports and Spaceports


**Port feature**


2D Special Feature
2 The port is built on the ruins of an older structure, or may be all-but-ruined itself.
3 The port has a large ‘alien quarter’ which may be inhabited by a single culture not normally seen in this
region, or a mix of races.
4 The port lacks capability in an area that would normally be present. For example, a Class A port would
normally be expected to have some starship-building capability but for some reason this port lacks it,
either temporarily or permanently.
5 There is no dedicated downport as such. Instead, the orbital port serves a web of spaceports which may
be in competition for business.
6 The port is a specialist type, with minimal facilities outside this area of expertise.
7 An installation is present. See Installations on page 138.
8 The port is an independently run freeport rather than being tied to the mainworld government.
9 The port is directly run by a major shipping line or political entity, giving preferential treatment to favoured
clients and making life unusually difficult for others.
10 The port is a major trade nexus.
11 The system’s main port is not at the mainworld but instead orbits another body in the system. Sublight
craft connect the two but most visitors stop over at the starport without visiting the mainworld.
12 The port is of unusual construction. A downport might be a seaport/rail nexus; a highport may be built out
of a couple of old starships welded together.

**FREEPORTS**
A freeport is an independent starport or spaceport,
and can have a starport code even if it is not the
system’s main port. Where most ports are owned by
a world or multi-world society, a freeport is not; it is a
commercial entity in its own right. There are different
kinds of freeport, from vast corporate installations
which make large amounts of money supporting
commercial traffic in the region to seedy backwater
ports where anything can be had for a price. There
is a distinction to be drawn between a corporate-
owned commercial port that exists to support the
corporation’s ships (which are the main revenue
earners) and a corporate freeport, which makes its
money from the shipping that comes through. Popular
entertainment links the term ‘freeport’ with pirates and
smugglers but most make whatever profit they can in
legal ways – which is not saying that their prices are
fair or the service is any good, of course.

A corporate freeport will typically have a higher Law
Level and be subject to a great many regulations.
It is likely to be clean, efficient and rather bland. As
an entity dedicated to making money rather than
supporting trade, a corporate freeport is likely to have
many businesses dedicated to parting Travellers from


their money. Expensive and luxurious hotels, casinos
and lavish recreation facilities are common; many
corporate freeports are more like holiday resorts than
transportation hubs. Prices in shops are likely to be 10-
20% higher than usual – at least – and the selection of
goods will be enormous.


The operators of a corporate freeport are always
looking for a good deal and an extra Credit. They may
offer preferential services – in return for an annual fee,
of course – or have ‘members only’ areas which offer
benefits unavailable to other visitors.


An independent freeport is in many ways the opposite
of this. Typically run on a shoestring, independent
freeports can only sell what they can obtain and that
fluctuates greatly. Operators will try to make deals
that guarantee a reliable source of spares, supplies
and goods for their shops but are at the mercy of
market conditions. Law Levels tend to be lower and
trade largely unregulated. This means that, in theory,
it is possible to obtain almost anything in the seedier
freeports but only if it is available and the seller wants
to part with it. Those who come to a freeport seeking
illicit arms and advanced armour are often disappointed
to find several people who would happily sell nuclear
warheads to any passer-by... if only they had any.

RUINS
Starports can become ruined quickly due to
catastrophe, or slowly due to neglect. A port that has
suffered severe damage from war or natural disaster
will normally retain its original rating until there is no
longer any realistic prospect of it regaining its normal
status. For example, a wrecked Class B starport will
continue to be rated as such in navigational databases
until it becomes obvious that it is not going to be rebuilt.
This can cause problems for Travellers who arrive
expecting to find a bustling port, only to discover a
remnant of the former personnel struggling to keep
a small section of the installation going using parts
scavenged from the remainder.


Conversely, Travellers might approach a port listed
as Class C, D or E, and which can provide only the
services associated with installations of that kind but
discover that the activities of this low-capability port
go on amid the ruins of a much greater installation.
Ruins may not be of a starport; some ports are built
atop ancient structures or incorporate remains of a
long-vanished culture. This might be a mysterious high-
technology site or the home of a stone-age civilisation.
A port might continue to operate alongside eerily
deserted structures of an abandoned city, picked over
by scavengers but otherwise largely ignored.


SPECIALIST PORTS
Most starports have a wide range of capabilities,
although what level they can provide these services to
depends upon their size and class. Specialist ports may
have little or no capability outside their primary area
of expertise. It is far more common to find specialist
spaceports than starports but sometimes the only port
in a system was built with a specific purpose in mind
and little regard for other activities.


Industrial Ports are specialist installations catering to
bulk transport of raw materials and finished goods to
and from industrial or resource-production sites. Such an
installation will usually have minimal passenger-handling
facilities and is optimised to turn around big ships like
bulk freighters in the shortest possible time. Smaller craft
can be handled but not as efficiently. On some worlds,
the main starport can be considered an industrial port;
such places are often rather grim for visitors.


Launch Facilities are not spaceports as such but
sometimes co-opted to act as one. For example, the
launch facility used by a mid-tech world’s own space
exploration might be developed into a rudimentary
starport when ships begin to arrive from other
systems. Launches of locally produced vehicles may
or may not continue, depending on circumstances.
Where it is possible to buy advanced spacecraft, a
developing port’s operators will try to do so but those
without the funds or in regions where nothing better
is available may continue to launch chemical rockets
from what has become their de facto starport. A
launch facility is not really set up to handle commercial
offworld traffic, although its personnel will normally
be able to extend at least a measure of assistance to
starfarers who come to visit.


Makeshift Ports are often improvised or set up on a
temporary basis. Some will eventually gain a measure
of permanence, with proper facilities built over time
and services expanded until a proper starport exists.
However, where populations are low or transient the
port may be nothing more than a few prefabs and
comms antenna plus a concreted area, or it may be
the usual landing-place for the supply ship supporting
a frontier mining colony, in which case the only
support facilities will be the camp’s own resources.
Makeshift ports sometimes operate for years or even
generations, often without becoming any better than
they started out. Most are abandoned when the
outpost or facility they serve is no longer in use. A
seaport, rail junction or airport on a mid-tech world
which has been pressed into service as a starport
could also be considered to be a makeshift port.


Military Ports exist, rather obviously, to support
military activity in space. A military port differs from a
naval base in that it serves primarily logistics ships
and troop transports – the vessels that put boots on
the ground of other planets rather than the warships
that fight for control of space. Most military ports are
located in remote areas and closed to commercial
traffic, although sometimes a small military port will be
co-located with a civilian installation. Military ports are
usually but not always crewed by military personnel;
some use civilian contractors. A military port will
usually have defences of some kind and may be a
major nexus of a world’s orbital defence system. More
commonly, ground-based weapons are located away
from port installations for tactical reasons.

136

###### Starports and Spaceports


Passenger Ports have minimal cargo-handling
facilities but are geared to either large personnel
movements or luxurious travel, often associated with
resorts or major tourist destinations. Political centres
usually have a specialist passenger port, with more
conventional trade running through other installations.

Private Ports are owned and operated by a political
or economic body which may or may not permit use
of the facility by outsiders. A private port differs from a
corporate freeport in that it exists to serve the interests
of the owning group rather than making money from
interstellar traffic. Some ports allow outsiders to use
part of the facilities, either at greatly increased prices
or subject to a lower quality of service than those with
access to the main facility. A true private port is restricted
to a select group. This might be heads of a government,
leaders of a church, direct couriers going to and from
the headquarters of an organisation, or even a single
very rich individual. Private ports tend to be small and,
by definition, not capable of handling large volumes of
commercial traffic. Some private ports can only berth
specific types of ship while others are more general and
in some cases offer very luxurious facilities.


TRADE NEXUS
Some ports become an important focus for trade, either
temporarily or on a long-term basis. This may result
in the port seeing more traffic than its starport code
would suggest, although when traffic expands there will
eventually be investment and upgrades.


A trade nexus typically has a booming commercial
market, with cargoes energetically traded in high
volumes. This has the effect of forcing down prices,
although often only for those who can afford to buy
in bulk. Smaller ships can benefit from picking up the
odd bits and pieces left over from these trades but
cannot compete with big shipping operators for the
prime bargains. A trade nexus can therefore actually
be a less attractive market for small-ship operators
than it might seem, although this is counterbalanced
by the greater availability of goods.


EFFECTS OF PORT FEATURES
The typical effects of various features can be found on
the Port Feature Effects table.

**Port Feature Effects**


Feature Effects
Freeport, Corporate Personal purchases and starship consumables typically cost 10–20% more than normal.
Freeport, Independent DM+D3 added to checks to determine buying price and subtracted from rolls to find
cargo. Determine the DM anew for every cargo.
Ruins Effects vary depending upon the nature of the ruins.
Specialist Port, Industrial DM-4 on checks to find cargo and passengers. Freight (raw materials or industrial
goods) will always be available but lot sizes are multiplied by five. For example, a
major freight lot normally is 1Dx10 tons; at an industrial port it is 1Dx50 tons.
Specialist Port,
Launch Facility


DM-3 on all checks to find passengers, freight and cargo. All cargo sizes and
passenger numbers are halved.
Specialist Port, Makeshift DM-1 on all checks to find passengers, freight and cargo. All cargo sizes are halved.
Specialist Port, Military Civilian ships may be heavily restricted and subject to additional security checks.
Otherwise, the port functions as normal.
Specialist Port, Passenger Passenger numbers are tripled. Checks to find freight or cargo are subject to DM-3.
Specialist Port, Private Outsiders may not be permitted to use the port at all. Fees may be payable, or prices
higher, for those permitted.
Trade Nexus DM+2 on all checks to find cargo and passengers. Twice the usual number of lots
are available. When determining the size of each lot, roll 1D and multiply the normal
amount by x1D. DM-2 applies to purchase price for lots over 100 tons.

Port Events
2D Special Feature
2 The port is under embargo or boycott by a major shipping corporation or other influential body. Personnel
and vessels may be harassed but there will be no attempts at violence.
3 The port has been neglected for a long time or suffered recent serious damage. Most ships bypass it,
which has greatly reduced the volume of traffic. Quantities of Common Goods available are down to 25%
of normal, while Trade Goods originating at the mainworld are up 100%. DM+/-3 applies when determining
buying prices – Trade Goods prices are worse for the Travellers, Common Goods are better.
4 The port is flooded with naval personnel, military troops, or law enforcement officers. They may be
responding to a problem at the port or staging for some other trouble spot. In any case, security checks will
be much tighter than usual.
5 The port is obviously run-down and short of investment. Many businesses have closed. Quantities of all
goods are halved.
6 The port is experiencing a slowdown in traffic. The quantity of available Trade Goods is unaffected but
Common Goods are halved. Prices for minor items in stores are 10% lower due to reduced demand.
7 Advantageous economic conditions (rumoured or real) have resulted in large numbers of entrepreneurs
and small-ship operators converging on the port. Markets are unusually vibrant, with double the usual
number of passengers, cargoes and freight available. Encounters with Rivals or old friends are likely.
8 The port is experiencing a surge in traffic. Prices in the stores are 20% worse than usual – higher when
the Travellers buy and lower when they sell. DM-2 applies on the Modified Price table, reflecting the way
greater volume of trade is forcing the price down.
9 The port is currently receiving a great deal of investment. Areas are being expanded and refurbished, and
shipping traffic is up. Quantities of available goods are doubled.
10 A group of entrepreneurs have opened up a new market – or convinced investors that one exists. The
amount of freight bound for one or more nearby worlds is tripled and investors are desperate to get it there.
They are willing to pay 2Dx5% above normal freighting rates.
11 Piracy, smuggling and conflict have increased in the region, pushing up the cost of repairs and starship
components as well as refits and maintenance by 20–60%. (2D3x10%).
12 The port is undergoing significant expansion or reconstruction. This might be going well or slowly,
depending on local conditions. In the meantime, sections are out of order, and workarounds may create
opportunities to bypass normal channels.


PORT EVENTS
Events can be quite long-term but are more subject
to change than features. If an event is taking place,
the Referee should roll 2D on the Port Events table or
choose an appropriate event.


INSTALLATIONS
The starport code gives an indication of the services
available but in some circumstances more extensive or
additional facilities are available.


Army Bases serve the armed forces of a world or
interstellar power. Most are separate from the main
starport and served by their own military port but
upon occasion the main port will be co-located with
an army base. This may not be the ‘home’ army of
the world but could be an occupying force or the
military of an interstellar power.

138

###### Starports and Spaceports


Defence Bases are home to assets defending the
world or system. This might be as basic as a few
ground-based missile launchers or control facility for
orbital defence platforms, or might house a flotilla of
fighters and patrol craft. Sometimes a system will have
several defence bases, especially if it houses a major
naval base. In this case, craft for the defence of the
system tend to be located at defence bases – close to
their patrol areas or zones of interest (such as a gas
giant or asteroid mining facility) whilst jump-capable
naval assets will be housed at a naval base, which will
have its own defensive craft.

Maintenance Facilities are specialist installations
designed to support large numbers of vessels or small
craft. Such a facility will be present in a naval base
and private installations are not uncommon on major
trade routes. Some maintenance facilities are built at
a system’s main starport; others have their own small
spaceport and receive traffic directly. Since crews often
take a vacation whilst their ship undergoes its annual
inspections and maintenance, some facilities have
extensive recreation amenities, or may be built around
tourist attractions. While not really set up for it, a
maintenance facility could manage to put a spacecraft
or even a small starship together from parts if available,
although only on a cottage-industry basis.


Naval Base house naval assets and can vary
considerably in size or role. The most basic naval
installation may be nothing more than a logistics
storage point or refuelling station supporting patrol
vessels. Other bases are specialist facilities, for
example conducting training or intelligence operations.
Larger bases house fleet assets ranging from a
handful of patrol ships to the dreadnoughts of a
major fleet. Naval bases are usually separate from
the starport and surrounded by a region of restricted
space but smaller installations may be co-located or
even serve as a system’s starport.


Naval Depots are particularly large naval bases,
usually the home of a major fleet and occupying or
at least dominating an entire star system. There may
or may not be a mainworld in a depot system – in
some cases the entire population of the star system
consists of naval personnel and their dependents,
plus civilian contractors and workers supporting the
depot. Most depots have shipbuilding facilities, vast
repair yards and a ‘mothball fleet’ of obsolete vessels
that could be reactivated at need. In systems with a
large civilian population, the depot will be separate
from the main civil port but in a ‘navy system’ the
depot might be the only port in-system, often with a
civil section to support passing traffic.

###### Starports and Spaceports


TRAVELLER


Research Installations are large and important
facilities dedicated to scientific research. Some are
secret, some less so, but most tend to be secure and
located in a remote area. Some installations conduct
a range of research while others specialise. Research
installations are usually indicated by a Greek letter,
e.g. Research Station Gamma or Research Station
Omicron. These names give away nothing about the
nature of the research conducted there. Some are more
open about their affiliation or nature, with designations
such as the Windon Institute or Imperial Long-Range
Communications Research Centre. A modest-sized
research station may be co-located with the starport, or
the installation might be the only port in the system.


Scout Bases, or Exploration Bases, are variable
in size and importance. Some are little more than
outposts used for refuelling exploration ships or
monitoring an unusual world. Exploration bases
exist to support operations in a particular area and
may have specialist vessels such as rescue tugs
or mobile laboratories. Other scout bases are quite
large and general or specific in purpose, including
training installations and regional command centres.
Scout bases are often co-located with small
starports; in some cases the port is run by scout
personnel as part of their duties.


Shipyards or spacecraft construction facilities are
normally present at high-end starports but major
shipbuilding yards tend to be large installations in their
own right. They may be co-located with a starport
(not necessarily a Class A port) or have their own
spaceport. Most construction facilities are relatively
small, with big freighters, liners and battleships being
built in a number of specialist yards.


Way Stations are the equivalent of naval depots but
geared to exploration or the activities of the Scout
Service. They have extensive facilities and large
amounts of shipping present. Most major Scout
Service missions begin at a way station and specialist
or very long-range (or just plain large) scout vessels
are located there. Way stations may also serve as
concentration points for survey and courier vessels,
and are always administrative hubs.


STARPORT LAW AND DEFENCES
Starports are an obvious target for raiders and
criminals, since they typically represent the most
intensive economic activity in an entire solar system.


Most ports have some form of law enforcement and
at least rudimentary defences against attack. In a
small port, especially an independent freeport, this
might be on an ad-hoc basis, with business owners
maintaining guards and everyone fighting to defend
whatever parts of the port they consider important
in the event of an attack. Larger installations have
more organised defences.


A starport operated by the host government will
likely have the same Law Level as the planet it is on,
or perhaps one or two Law Levels lower if a strict
government wants a more permissive, welcoming
environment to encourage trade. Where a port is
independent of the host government, such as most
ports in the Third Imperium universe, its operators
will set their own laws.


Commonly, the highport component will have a set of
laws geared to the ‘interstellar norm’ and the downport
will correspond to local Law Level. Sometimes the
downport will have an ‘interstellar’ Law Level as well,
with local law applying once the extrality line is crossed.


To randomly determine the Law Level of a port, roll 2D
and subtract the result from the Law Level of the host
government, applying the following DMs:


Class A port +7
Class B or F port +5
Class C or G port +3
Class D or H port +1
Class E port 0


Class A port +6
Class B or F port +3
Class C or G port 0
Class D or H port -3
Class E port -6


A result lower than 0 indicates no law beyond personal
defence of property. Set Law Level to 0.


LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SECURITY
To determine the level of law enforcement and security
available at a port, roll 2D on the Port Enforcement
table, with the following DMs:

140

###### Starports and Spaceports


**Port Enforcement**


Result Law Enforcement Notes
0 or less Lawless and violent Essentially a violent anarchy, with gangs, private guards, or security
selfishly protecting influential individuals’ property.
1–2 Lawless and harmonious No formal law enforcement but armed individuals cooperate against
threats on a common-interest basis.
3–4 Minimal security force A sheriff and deputies, armed with civilian firearms, possibly part-time.
5–6 Small security force Small professional security force with civilian weapons.
7–8 Average security force Adequate security force with paramilitary equipment including
automatic weapons.
9–10 Well-equipped security force Adequate security force with paramilitary equipment including
support weapons.
11–12 Paramilitary security service Large professional security force. Some personnel have access to
heavy military weapons.
13–14 Military security service Large professional security service organised along military lines,
with heavy weapons. Possibly a mercenary formation.
15 or more Private army Excessive military-style security service with armed vehicles and
support platforms.

**STARPORT DEFENCES**
Most ports have defences to prevent an armed ship
holding the port to ransom or just blasting bits off it.
This level of defence depends on the port’s budget and
what is available. Note that these defences are what is
directly controlled by the port; the host world may have
its own defensive forces which will usually protect the
port as well as the rest of the system.

To determine the level of defence available to a port,
roll 2D and add the following modifiers, then consult the
Port Defence table:


The defences of a port are often dictated by local
Tech Level or what can be bought on the open
market. Class D and E ports can normally only mount
defensive weapons planetside, so will typically have
missile launchers or laser turrets in bunkers close to
the landing area. Ports with an orbital component will
usually mount most of their defensive weaponry there,
with a few weapons planetside.


Normally, port operators obtain the best weaponry
they can afford from offworld but sometimes this is not
possible. Ports on mid-tech worlds are thus sometimes
defended by conventional artillery or anti-aircraft missile
systems, which are of marginal effectiveness at best.

### EGALITIES

### AND LAWBREAKING

Sometimes Travellers have to break local laws to get
something done or will fall foul of the authorities for
some reason. The threat of punishment for engaging in
illegal activity can be used as an adventure motivator –
perhaps the Travellers are offered dismissal of trumped-
up charges in return for their assistance with a problem
the colony director has.

Legal complications can be used to keep the
Travellers’ behaviour in check. This is easiest when
there is an interstellar polity with effective inter-world
law enforcement but there are still options out on
the wild frontiers. So long as any form of interstellar
communication exists, world governments have the
option to pursue those who break their laws. This is
unusual in the case of minor offences but those who
commit serious crimes may be subject to extradition or
pursuit by agents of the offended government.

If Travellers leave a world without answering for their
crimes, or their crimes are discovered after they leave,
the authorities will decide what to do about them. Their
response depends on the local Law Level and severity
of the crime. The Crimes table indicates the type of
crime and its severity, along with the associated DM
applied to sentencing. This table is an expansion of the
one on page 225 of the Traveller Core Rulebook.

The level of severity of a crime can be moved one
(or in extreme cases, two) categories either way by
aggravating or mitigating circumstances. For example,
a petty theft offence committed by someone who


was starving might be downgraded to Trivial or even
Insignificant. The same theft from a charity or high-
profile individual might be considered more serious.
Likewise, an armed robbery carried out with a fusion
gun would also be viewed as more serious.


As a general rule, crimes that disrupt economic activity
or damage the financial well-being of a large number
of people tend to be considered very serious. It is also
possible that a crime’s severity might be increased
or decreased due to a PR exercise, perception of the
perpetrator or victim, or other factors.


The DM given in this table can be used on the
Sentencing table (page 225 of the Traveller Core
Rulebook) but is also used to determine the world
government’s response if the Travellers skip
town with unpaid parking tickets or a warrant for
arrest after their murder spree, as shown on the
Government Response table.


Bounties are set at Cr1000 x 2D + the severity DM of
the crime. A Large Bounty is five times as great and
a Huge Bounty is 25 times as great. Bounties are
usually offered for the return of the criminal in a state
fit to stand trial, although if they are killed resisting
arrest the bounty is usually payable. If the criminal has
already been sentenced to death or is likely to be, a
dead or alive bounty may be offered.

**Crimes**


Severity Example DM

An extradition request indicates that other worlds
are notified that the criminal is wanted. If there is an
extradition treaty in place, other worlds will attempt to
detain the criminal and ship them back for trial.


If Agents are despatched, this indicates that D3 law
enforcement agents or contracted bounty hunters (or
assassins) are sent to look for the criminal. Contracts
and assignments are usually for a year, although in
some cases are extended repeatedly.


A Special Task Force consists of 2D agents whose
sole job is finding the criminal and bringing them in or
eliminating them, backed up by whatever intelligence
and support services are available. Such a task force will
usually have warrants requesting assistance from other
world governments, which may or may not be honoured.


EXTRADITION TREATIES
Extradition treaties may exist between worlds and a
government will typically attempt to establish treaties
with nearby worlds. Local politics may mean treaties
automatically exist or cannot exist, depending on
relations between the world governments. Unless
such a factor exists, an extradition treaty is in place
on a 2D roll of 8+, with the average of the two worlds’
Law Level as a positive DM and their distance apart in
parsecs as a negative DM.


For example, Marduk (Law Level 6) is 2 parsecs from
Thebus (Law Level 0). The average of these Law
Levels is 3. Subtracting 2 for their distance apart gives
DM+1, applied to a 2D roll. On 8+ an extradition treaty
exists between the two. Oghma is just 1 parsec from
Marduk and has Law Level 4, which would suggest
DM+4. However, Oghma is a cess-pit of slavers with no
regard for anyone else’s laws, so the Referee decides
that no treaty would be in place.


Within a multiworld polity such as the Third Imperium,
DM+4 applies when determining whether treaties
exist. Note that this increases the distance over which
an extradition treaty is likely to exist, as well as the
chance of one existing at all.


WEAPON-RELATED CRIME
The Law Level of a world indicates how much formal
law exists within the jurisdiction of its government.
A very low Law Level generally means there is no
formal ban on certain weapons but this does not mean
‘anything goes’. Even if there is no law against it,
someone wandering down the street with a plasma gun
will attract attention and suspicion. Business owners
will have their own rules about who can bring what onto
their property and as a rule anyone with something
worth stealing will be opposed to strangers bringing
heavy firepower into their shop or onto their land.


This means it is possible to be told ‘you can’t bring
that in here’ even if the planet has no law against
that weapon. Those who ignore such a warning may
well find themselves under fire. A low Law Level often
translates to high levels of personal armament and the
willingness to establish a security force either to protect
a single business or the community as a whole. Those
that think ‘no laws’ means they can do as they please
may find a whole town united against them.


Weaponry and combat-related equipment can be
grouped into five categories, determined by its
ability to win fights and cause large numbers of
casualties. These categories do not supersede Law
Level prohibitions but can be used by the Referee
to determine how seriously weapons infractions are
viewed. A Traveller might be able to buy a particular
weapon on a low-law world but could later run into
trouble if caught with it. Penalties increase depending
upon the category of the weapon.

###### Legalities and Lawbreaking


Many interstellar polities operate a licensing system for
purchasing weapons, which uses the same categories.
This applies when purchasing from reputable shops and
dealers, who can be held accountable. Criminals and
shady dealers do not much care about such niceties
and may charge higher prices for weaponry – or the
weapons might have a history the Travellers would
prefer not to be associated with.

To buy a weapon legally, a Traveller must have
appropriate licensing in place if it is necessary. For
an over-the-counter sale, the weapon must also
be legal to own in that locality. It is possible to buy
weaponry for export – for use by security personnel
aboard a starship or a mercenary force, for example

- even if it is not legal for use on that world.
Legally bought weaponry comes with appropriate
documentation and a reasonable certainty that it
does not have a crime connected with it.

If weapons are not available legally or the Travellers
do not have the right paperwork, they must use other
methods to obtain their desired level of firepower.

**CATEGORY 1: UNRESTRICTED**
Unrestricted weapons can be purchased without any
need for a license, so long as they are legal where
bought or the buyer can demonstrate that the weapon
or equipment is to be transported out of that locality to
somewhere it is legal to own and use.

Unrestricted weaponry includes almost all melee
weapons (some very powerful or exotic weapons may
be subject to licensing), bows and less-lethal weaponry
such as tranq guns and stunners. In addition, light
personal armour such as mesh is unrestricted.

**CATEGORY 2: CIVILIAN SMALLARMS**
Most dealers will require the purchaser to
demonstrate the capability for safe use, which
translates to either presentation of appropriate
certification or an accreditation session on a firing
range (at the buyer’s expense). Travellers who have
gained Gun Combat 1 or better through a formal
period of training will have such documentation, or
it can be obtained by taking a course and gaining
a certificate – or forging one. Skill level 0 is quite
sufficient to satisfy the needs of this course.


Civilian smallarms include handguns such as semi-
automatic pistols and revolvers, shotguns, semi-
automatic rifles and carbines. Light personal armour
including mesh and cloth are also within this category.


Category 2 is generally considered the ‘polite
preparation’ level in most localities. That is to say,
whatever the local Law Level, someone carrying
heavier weapons than this will attract attention unless
they are obviously a mercenary, security guard or
similar armed occupation. Explosives with a civilian
application are typically considered Category 2 items,
as are light starship weapons such as beam lasers.


CATEGORY 3: PARAMILITARY SMALLARMS
Most localities are not unduly concerned with people
owning or carrying a pistol or shotgun but paramilitary
weapons can cause large numbers of casualties if used
indiscrimitely or to commit a crime. For this reason, the
purchaser must demonstrate ‘a suitable need’ as well
as safe use as per Category 2. Bodyguards, security
personnel and licensed mercenaries are considered to
have a ‘suitable need’, as are those who employ them.
Thus, the captain of a free trader who wants to buy a
couple of laser carbines will be considered to have a
legitimate need under most circumstances.


Category 3 items include light automatics such as
assault rifles and submachineguns, laser weapons
and heavier personal armour such as flak. More
powerful starship weapons such as pulse lasers and
conventional missiles are considered Category 3 items.


CATEGORY 4: MILITARY SMALLARMS
Military weapons are generally restricted as they pose
a significant threat to law enforcers and the civilian
population. Even where a weapon is legal, the vendor
will normally require licensing to be in place as they
may be held accountable for misuse of that crate of
gauss rifles they sold last week


Category 4 equipment includes heavier or more
capable personal weapons such as advanced combat
rifles, gauss weapons, grenades and mid-tech support
weapons such as general-purpose machineguns,
anti-tank rockets and grenades. Combat armour is a
Category 4 item, as are most heavy starship weapons
such as torpedoes, fusion and plasma guns, and
particle accelerators. Obtaining these weapons can be
difficult for civilian operators.

TRAVELLER


CATEGORY 5: RESTRICTED MILITARY SYSTEMS
Category 5 items are normally only sold to accredited
mercenary units, government clients or similarly
accountable bodies.


Category 5 items include plasma and fusion weapons,
heavy support weapons, military combat vehicles and
battle dress. Nuclear mining explosives, where they
are permitted at all, would be a Category 5 item, as are
very heavy starship weapons such as meson guns and
weapons designed to attack ground targets.


OBTAINING WEAPONRY
Category 1–3 items can typically be bought over
the counter anywhere they are legal and licensing
requirements mainly serve to ensure the new user
does not accidentally injure himself on the way out of
the shop. Category 4 items are not normally available
in the typical starport weapons dealer’s outlet and
those who do sell them generally deal in quantities


suitable for the mercenary or military marketplace.
However, a few items (often an entirely random
selection) may be on sale to those with the proper
accreditation. Category 5 weapons typically have to
be bought from a specialist dealer (and are subject to
stringent checks because the dealer wants to keep his
licence) or through back channels.


On very low-law worlds, weapons dealers will sell
whatever they can get, although it is highly unlikely
that a small starport gun-dealer will have rows of shiny
battle dress suits for sale. A dealer who can get such
items is a real find and might be the subject of one
or more adventures as the Travellers track down a
legendary weapons shop or earn the dealer’s goodwill
to gain access to the ‘private stock’ reserved for select
customers. A dealer who can get top-end military kit
should come with a story attached and the Travellers
should be made to earn their equipment rather than
simply wandering into a Law Level 0 shop and buying a
boatload of battle dress.

**Hot Weapons**


2D Complication
2–3 Item is defective or missing parts. This will not be immediately apparent. If multiple items are bought
it may be possible to cannibalise some to get others working.
4–5 Item was used in a serious crime. Being caught with it will lead to arrest and possibly prosecution.
6–7 Item is not in great condition but is functional and has no major complications.
8–9 Item was stolen from a notable source such as a large arms firm or mercenary unit, which is quietly
seeking its return.
10–11 Item was taken from the bodies of previous users, whose associates are seeking revenge.
12 The item is in good working order but the price is very high. Multiply price by 3.

If the Travellers do not have the appropriate licensing
in place, they can get around this problem in a variety
of ways. Documentation can be forged or dealers can
be bribed. However, military arms are a lucrative item
and few dealers will risk their license – or a long prison
term – for a few Credits. Again, services rendered
might be a way to get around the problem.

Alternatively, the Travellers could find a dealer who
does not care about niceties of licensing. Finding
someone who will sell weaponry to anyone, either
under-the-counter in an otherwise reputable outlet or
from a back-alley ‘dealership’, requires some effort.
This can be the subject of an adventure, or can be
abstracted using the Arms Dealers table.

The Travellers should make a Streetwise check,
subtracting the world’s Law Level.

Clean weapons come with plausible documentation
(which may actually be real) and no associations
with crime or dangerous previous owners. Hot
weapons have no documentation and are subject to
a number of complications.

Roll 2D on the Hot Weapons table for the item’s ‘story’.

**Arms Dealers**

UNDER THE COUNTER WEAPONS
When the Travellers buy from a less-than reputable
source, they can expect to pay extra. Roll 2D and add
the world’s Law Level. Asking price is increased by
10% times the result of this roll and may be increased
further by other considerations such as the Travellers’
relationship with the seller.


If the Travellers are caught with a Category 4 or 5 item,
even somewhere it is not illegal, they may be required
to present documentation to show it is legally owned.
This can happen when a free trader is boarded by a
customs party, for example. It is sometimes possible to
blather through such a situation, for example if there are
a lot of security threats in the region and the Travellers
have a good reputation for honest trading. If not, items
will be confiscated and the Travellers may be arrested.


If weapons are used in a crime, the category of the
weapon is applied as a DM on the Sentencing table
(see the Traveller Core Rulebook, page 225).
Note that weaponry carried as part of a properly
documented cargo is unlikely to get the Travellers
into trouble, provided it is not headed for a destination
where it is illegal. Resale as cargo at a starport is
entirely legal even if the weapons would be illegal to
own on that world – an item that stays in a shipping
container is not the authorities’ problem.

# S LOWER-THAN-LIGHT

Conventional physics states nothing can travel faster
than light in normal space. Methods such as the jump
drive bypass this limit by moving the vessel into another
kind of space and returning it to the normal universe
elsewhere. For a vessel attempting to approach the
speed of light by simply accelerating for a long time,
the amount of energy required to accelerate the craft
increases exponentially and trends to infinity. Thus the
faster a vessel is going, the more energy is required to
accelerate it further, with this energy becoming infinite
at the point lightspeed is achieved.

This does not make it impossible to travel between star
systems at slower-than-light speeds. A vessel could
accelerate to a reasonable proportion of the speed of
light and then coast most of the way to its destination
before slowing down over a period of months or years.
At 10% of the speed of light it is possible to cover a
parsec in around 35 years, although with acceleration
and deceleration taken into account the transit time
is more likely to be about 50–100 years between
reasonably close star systems.

A vessel moving at a significant proportion of the speed
of light would experience time dilation effects, making
the voyage seem shorter to the crew and passengers
than time passing in the outside universe. The effect
becomes more pronounced as speed increases,
making a long journey at a high fraction of the speed of
light essentially a one-way ticket into the future.


It is possible for a long-lived species to undertake
such a voyage but for races like humans the obvious
solutions are to use generation ships, with one or
more generations of passengers born and living
aboard, or ‘sleeper’ ships with the passengers in
suspended animation. A rotation of crews, working
for a couple of years before returning to stasis, would
be able to maintain such a vessel and deal with
eventualities as they arose.


Within the Third Imperium universe there are several
examples of species using slower-than-light travel for
expansion or even to maintain an interstellar state.
Most use sleeper ships but there are examples of
species that carry the means to produce cloned or
otherwise artificial people at the far end of the journey.


Robotic ships also offer possibilities. A species might
stay on its home world but dispatch robotic vessels
to bring back necessary materials over a time frame
of centuries. Such long-term planning would have to
be accompanied by high technology and it is possible
that robot ships might still be building infrastructure
on distant worlds long after the parent civilisation
became extinct. Native races might be enslaved by
robotic invaders to labour in the name of a distant
and long-dead empire.


Remnants of this sort, along with forgotten ‘sleeper’
ships or their dead hulks, could be introduced
into a Traveller campaign without distorting the
setting. They would have to come from somewhere,
prompting questions about whether the vessel
encountered is the precursor of an invasion or just a
lost fragment of an earlier era.


# T HE JUMP DRIVE

The standard means of interstellar travel in the Third
Imperium universe is the jump drive. This translates
the vessel into an alternate place or state, a private
pocket universe just for that ship. A jump is generally
considered to take approximately 150–180 hours
(roughly a week) and covers up to one parsec (a
parsec is 3.27 light years) per jump number per week –
i.e. a jump-3 ship can transit up to three parsecs (9.81
light years) in a week during a normal jump.

A standard jump drive uses fuel equal to 10% of the
tonnage of the vessel per parsec. Thus a 500-ton jump-
3 ship needs 50 tons of fuel per parsec and can jump
one to three parsecs at a time. It is possible to carry
fuel for multiple jumps but there are practical limits on
how much of a ship can be given over to fuel tankage.

Jump travel is not without its hazards. Even a well-
maintained vessel on a known route can suffer a
misjump. A minor misjump might shorten or lengthen
the duration of the jump and/or change its direction and
distance by a huge amount. More serious misjumps
can damage or destroy a ship as well as altering the
exit point. There are also tales of very strange things
happening in jumpspace, including unintelligible
radio signals and strange phenomena that can drive
crewmembers insane.

In the Third Imperium universe the jump drive obeys
certain well-understood rules:

- A jump takes approximately seven days, typically
    plus or minus a day, and a jump capable vessel
    can cover any distance up to the ship’s jump
    number in parsecs in that time.
- A jump requires fuel equal to 10% of the ship’s
    mass per parsec.
- The ship is completely cut off from the outside
    universe whilst in jumpspace.
- Jumping within a gravity well is dangerous.

Using the jump drive is never without at least some
risk but hazards can be minimised by following certain
guidelines. Most spacers will not even consider
engaging a jump drive when within 100 diameters of a
planet, star, or other massive object. Even something
as small as another ship can cause a serious
misjump incident.


The 100-diameter limit is more a useful rule of thumb
than physical law. A very dense but small object has
sufficient gravity to make jumps hazardous beyond 100
diameters. However, for an average rocky planet the
100-diameter rule is a good guideline. Most spacers
calculate a safe jump as ‘100 plus a bit’. Jumping
within 10 diameters of a massive object is extremely
dangerous and would only be attempted in the most
desperate of circumstances.


JUMP MASKING
A jump whose emergence point is too close to
an object with strong gravity can have serious
consequences. Whilst it is possible (but very risky) to
jump from within 100 diameters of an object, it is not
usually possible to jump directly into an area ‘masked’
by the 100-diameter limit of an object. Occasionally
a ship does emerge within this limit but this causes
damage to the jump drive and can sometimes cause a
ship to disintegrate on emergence.


It is not possible to hit a precise emergence point
within the 100-diameter limit. Most commonly,
attempting to do so will cause the ship to precipitate
out of jump (with damage to the drive) at the 100
diameter limit. Sometimes the ship will misjump
instead and end up somewhere entirely different. The
duration of the jump is not affected by any shortening
of the distance covered due to jump masking – it is not
possible to make a jump in a couple of days by aiming
for a distant point and being precipitated out of jump
by an intervening object.


Jump masking has some important implications for
interstellar travel. A star like our sun has a 100-diameter
limit of about 140,000,000 kilometres, or a little less
than one Astronomical Unit. This means that virtually
every location in the solar system inside Earth’s orbit is
masked by the sun. In other words it is not possible to
jump directly to Mercury or Venus; the only way to get
there is by sublight travel.


TRAVELLER


Very large stars mask huge volumes of space. A
giant star might have a diameter of 100,000,000 to
1,000,000,000 kilometres, and would mask an area 100
times greater. Even the outer planets might be masked,
requiring a long transit to and from a safe jump point.
Systems with multiple stars may also experience
significant jump masking, with some worlds having
periods when they are masked and others when they
are not as a result of relative orbital positions.


Calculating the masked radius for a gas giant requires a
definition of its radius, which is usually taken as the point
at which atmospheric pressure reaches 1 atmosphere.
For a large gas giant (e.g. Jupiter) this is around 60-
70,000 kilometres. For a small gas giant (e.g. Uranus
or Neptune), a figure of around 25,000 kilometres is
common. This means that a small gas giant has a
100-diameter limit of some 2,500,000 kilometres; for a
large gas giant it will be around 6,500,000 kilometres.


This has implications for shipping to a port located on
a gas giant moon. The moons of Jupiter have orbital
radii ranging from 128,000 kilometres to 24,000,000
kilometres, with the larger moons being closer in. It is
possible that a mainworld that is also a gas giant moon
would be masked, requiring ships to make a long transit
in and out from the jump point. This might have strategic
advantages but it adds time to a merchant ship’s trip
which will harm trade, stunting economic growth of a
world located there, unless it was sufficiently rich in
resources to be a must-go trade destination.


Jumping within 100 diameters of an object imposes
DM-4 on Engineer (j-drive) checks, and jumping within
10 diameters imposes DM-8. It is still possible to make
such a jump and survive... possible, but not likely.


Lagrange points, where the gravity of two objects
create a net zero force, are actually subject to greater
gravitational forces than normal – the fact that two
forces cancel one another out does not mean there is
no force on a ship jumping at that point. It is extremely
dangerous to jump from a Lagrange point; an additional
DM-2 is applied to Engineer checks on top of the
normal DM for jumping within a gravity well.


The main implication of jump masking is to create areas
where starships must proceed at sublight speeds,
making them vulnerable to piracy and other hazards.
Worlds within a jump-masked area are likely to be less
economically developed than those with quicker access
to interstellar trade, although this does not mean all
jump-masked worlds are backward.


Jump-masked worlds and gas giant moons are
an ideal location for sensitive outposts, prisons
and bases. Traffic volume will be lower due to the
difficulty of getting to and from the location, and if
there is an attempt to attack or escape from the
installation the warning time will be greater. Jump-
masked areas of a star system are often largely
forgotten about – many spacers have a blind spot
towards places they cannot easily go – and so make
ideal hiding places for pirates or secret caches.


JUMP PRECIPITATION
Jump precipitation can occur if a plot is too tight and
the ship hits the 100-diameter limit before emergence,
or if the jump shadow of an unpredicted object lies
across the vessel’s path. This usually happens due
to very poor astrogation, creating a path which takes
the ship through the 100-diameter shadow of a star or
planet. It can also occur if there is an uncharted object
such as a rogue planet on the ship’s course. A vessel
would have to be very unlucky to be precipitated out of
jump by a comet or other relatively small object, but it
does happen from time-to-time.


A ship that is precipitated out of jump in this manner still
takes the normal time for a jump; it just does not go as
far. Thus a vessel attempting a six-parsec jump but is
precipitated out of jumpspace by an object encountered
1.5 parsecs from the starting point still takes the normal
time for the jump. The crew may have no warning that
this has occurred until they re-enter normal space.


JUMP VARIANCE
When a jump is plotted, the astrogator attempts
to refine all of the vastly complex calculations and
variables involved into a ‘jump plot’ that will bring the
vessel out as close to the 100-diameter limit of the
destination as possible. The ship’s engineer then
attempts to implement the plot in such a way as to
get as close as possible to the astrogator’s theoretical
model. Jump navigation is not a 100% precise science
however and there will always be some variance.


Assuming the plot from the astrogator and entry into
jumpspace set up by the engineer are both good (both
skill checks are made) then the vessel will arrive a safe
margin short of the 100-diameter emergence limit after
approximately 160 hours +/- 20 hours.

150

###### THE JUMP DRIVE


The Distance and Time Variance tables give typical
jump characteristics. The Effect of the astrogator’s skill
check to set up the jump plot is used as a DM on the
Distance Variance table. The Effect of the engineer’s
skill check is used as a DM on the Time Variance table.
In general, the better the plot and jump entry, the closer
the jump will be to baseline parameters. A model jump
of exactly normal duration and emergence is at 105
diameters to create a margin of safety, although a very
good plot can bring the ship out at exactly the 100
diameter limit and shave some time off the journey.

If a Bad Jump is indicated, see page 151-152.

If the variance indicates the emergence point is closer
to the target than the 100 diameter limit, the vessel is
precipitated out of jumpspace at the 100 diameter limit,
suffering the effects of jump precipitation on page 150.


Variance can be long or short. Roll 1D: Odd indicates that
the jump is long in duration, even indicates it is short.


BAD JUMPS
Bad jumps are not confined to Misjumps – some
systems are notorious for unpleasant jump
effects, for no known reason. In other cases, a
hurried insertion or decayed jump plot may also
merit a bad jump. A decayed plot is a set of jump
parameters generated for use under slightly different
circumstances (for example, the ship might have
significantly changed its speed and heading since the
plot was generated) or a plot that is more than 3D
hours old. Jump plots are sufficiently complex that
they decay quickly. At first this will cause a bad jump;
severe decay in the plot will cause a misjump.


If the jump variance rules are in use, ill-effects will
be felt by the crew and passengers if either Variance
table indicates a Bad Jump. If both tables indicate a
Bad Jump, the effects will be magnified as per Very
Bad Jumps on page 152.


A Bad Jump typically produces a feeling of dislocation
and confusion, often accompanied by nausea and
headaches, at the moment of entry and some time
before emergence. Everyone aboard the vessel must
make an END and INT check. One of these checks is
at Routine (6+) difficulty and the other at Difficult (10+)
difficulty level. A Traveller can choose which check is
taken at each difficulty level.


The END check determines if physical effects are
present. These include nausea and possibly vomiting,
plus often a blinding headache. If the END check is
failed, all checks the Traveller attempts are subject to a
DM equal to the Effect of the failure for 2D hours after
entry into jump and again after emergence.


An Effect of -6 or worse indicates the Traveller is
incapacitated; unconscious or wishing he was, for
2Dx30 minutes after which a DM-6 applies on all
checks for the following 4D hours.

###### THE JUMP DRIVE


TRAVELLER


The INT check determines if psychological effects
are present. These typically include unease, irritability
and paranoia, but in some cases can lead to a
complete breakdown. Anyone who fails the INT check
will be irritable, nervous and generally out of sorts
for the whole duration of the jump. This manifests as
difficulty in concentrating as well as a tendency to be
on edge which often makes interactions with other
Travellers unpleasant. DM-2 applies to all checks
associated with mental or interpersonal activities. The
Traveller will be visibly on edge and may appear to
be behaving suspiciously or in a paranoid fashion.
Memory lapses, covering a few minutes to an hour or
two, are also possible.


An Effect of -6 or worse indicates the Traveller is
suffering from serious mental effects. These manifest
as acute paranoia, blackouts and hallucinations.
A Traveller in this state might harm themselves or
someone else, or take a potentially dangerous action
such as locking a hatch that the rest of the crew
need to access a critical area.


Psychological effects last throughout the jump and
for 1D days afterward.


VERY BAD JUMPS
If both variance tables indicate a Bad Jump, or the
ship misjumps, the effects are magnified. Both checks
(INT and END) must be made as above, but DM-2
applies to both. In addition, there may be other effects
on the ship and its passengers.


On the Very Bad Jump table, DM-4 applies if Bad Jump
was indicated by both variances tables. DM-2 applies
if the Very Bad Jump was caused by precipitation due
to hitting the 100-diameter limit. Normal misjumps are
rolled without DM. DM+2 applies if the ship jumped
whilst under significant gravitational effects (typically
this means jumping within the 100-diameter limit of
an object). DM+4 applies if the ship jumped whilst
under serious gravitational effects (typically this means
jumping from within the 10-diamerter limit of a planet or
other body). Only one modifier is used – the Referee
should use the highest applicable to the ship.

Jumpspace intrusions are extremely serious. The ship’s

space to enter the ship. This will destroy any matter it
encounters, such as bulkheads, wiring and Travellers.
The intrusions are usually stable, so will be limited
to a particular location for the whole of the voyage.
However, additional intrusions can occur at any time
or existing ones may spread. A ship may be slowly
consumed by the intrusions, with Travellers forced to
retreat to unbreached compartments and hope the ship
emerges into normal space before it is lost entirely.


A ship suffering jumpspace intrusions suffers damage
equal to 2D-2 as a percentage of its Hull per day.
This matter is completely destroyed, requiring a
major rebuild if the ship survives. A severe intrusion
consumes 2D+10% of the ship’s Hull per day.


MISJUMPS
A Misjump occurs if the sum of the Effect achieved by
the astrogator and engineer is 0 or less. This means
that if one fails their check but the other makes theirs
by a greater margin, the Misjump is averted, although in
this case the effects of a Bad Jump should be imposed.


If the sum of the Effects is 0 or less, a Misjump
has indeed occurred and if both checks are failed
a Serious Misjump has happened. All Misjumps
are accompanied by the effects of a Bad Jump and
Serious Misjumps are accompanied by the effects
of a Very Bad Jump. This is in addition to the effects
noted on the Misjumps table.

2D Outcome
2 or less The ship is lost in jumpspace or emerges
as fragments and subatomic particles.
3–4 The ship misjumps 1D x 1D parsecs
in a random direction. Its jump drive is
completely wrecked upon emergence
and the passengers and crew risk
lasting psychological effects.
5–6 The ship misjumps 2D parsecs in a
random direction. Its jump drive is
severely damaged upon emergence.
7–8 The ship misjumps 1D parsecs in a

9–10 Duration increased or decreased
by 1D days. Jump drive requires
extensive recalibration (D3 days of
work) but no repairs.
11–12 Very rough jump, emergence is at 100
x 2D diameters from the target world.


JUMPSPACE CURRENTS
A current is a jumpspace phenomenon which typically
links two specific points in normal space. A jumpspace
current allows a ship to rapidly transit between its
entry and exit points using a normal jump, so a one-
week jump made at the entry point to a current can
allow a ship to travel hundreds or even thousands of
parsecs. However, this can damage the ship’s drive
or even destroy it if it is not properly calibrated for that
particular current. Some currents are one-way; others
can be transited in both directions, and the capability
of the jump drive required to make the transit can vary
depending on direction. Some currents have multiple
entry and exit points, and some exit points may require
a higher jump number to access than others.


Some currents can be entered by any ship capable of
making a jump. Others require a more powerful drive
to enter. So, a current rated as jump-3 would require
a ship capable of making a three parsec jump.
Lesser drives would not be able to enter the current
and might be damaged in the attempt. Alternatively,
a lesser jump drive might not be able to navigate the
current properly and might be deposited back into
normal space anywhere along its length rather than
safely reaching its destination.


A current might be rated more highly in one direction
than another, perhaps being accessible at one end by
any jump capable ship but requiring a jump-3 capable
ship to return. This might have interesting applications
for the settlement of the region at the far end.


WEIRDER JUMPSPACE
In the Third Imperium universe, jumpspace is a
mysterious and somewhat scary place but there
are few jumpspace phenomena. Some do exist,
such as regions where misjumps are more common
than usual, but in general jumpspace is a reliable
mechanism for getting from one place to another. It is
possible to add in additional ‘jumpspace weirdness’
without harming the universe too much.


One option is to assume that there is only one
jumpspace ‘place’ and that everything that has ever
entered jumpspace is there, all at the same time. A
properly working jump drive keeps ‘everything else’
out of a ship but one that is poorly maintained or has
suffered damage might not perform so well. This might
account for reports of mysterious signals received
whilst in jump, or wild tales of ships emerging with
what appeared to be collision damage.

If a Misjump occurs, roll 2D on the Misjumps table
below using the combined Effect of the Engineer and
Astrogation checks as a DM.

JUMP DRIVE CONCEPTS
Introducing a totally different interstellar drive system
to a Traveller campaign might impose unexpected
changes on the universe, or might make using
existing starship designs impossible. This might well
be desirable if a campaign is being built from the
ground up but it is not always possible to foresee the
implications of large-scale changes. Rather than doing
away with the concept of the jump drive and replacing
it with something else, it may be desirable to impose
some slightly different characteristics on the universe
or the performance of the drive, opening new options
without having to redesign every starship.

The following concepts require no changes to existing
ship designs and could be implemented on a local
scale within a setting that otherwise closely resembled
the Third Imperium universe. A one-off phenomenon
could be used to move Travellers to a new location, or
investigating it might be the focus of their mission.


153

###### THE JUMP DRIVE


TRAVELLER


More extreme examples of this phenomenon
might allow access to some ‘other place’ by way of
jumpspace. This might be a whole other universe,
either a pocket universe or a different version of our
own. It might be a realm of madness, or a misjump
might bring the Travellers out of jump in a subtly
different version of their own universe. What has
happened might not be apparent until the Travellers
see news reports from a war they have never heard of,
from a capital that is not the one they know.


A misjump might also cause the ship to emerge in the
distant past or far future, or in a distant region. Getting
home might be the focus of the campaign thereafter, or
preventing some event the Travellers know about from
their history books. This concept might also be used as
a one-off to move a campaign to a different setting.


An alternative might be to have objects and even
people transferring between ships in jump if their jump
fields have exactly the right resonance. This might
be a one-off scenario dealing with an entity or person
trapped in jumpspace for centuries and finally able
to board a ship by walking out of a wall, or it might
be commonplace enough that crews have to defend
their ship from intrusions by the Things That Live In
Jumpspace. This can be overdone, of course, but it
does lend a different flavour to the universe.


VARIABLE JUMP DURATION
Most spacers in the Third Imperium universe work to a
rule of thumb that a jump takes about one week, with a
variation of up to 20 or so hours being fairly common.
Many will quote ‘more than a day and it’s not okay’,
meaning that a variation of more than 24 hours long or
short generally indicates a misjump.


Under this rule, the time for a jump and its possible
variation can actually vary somewhat depending on
conditions in the local region of space. This creates
areas which are less accessible due to longer
transit times and others where jump is much faster.
These tend to have greater economic activity and
thus more developed worlds due to the rapidity of
interstellar commerce.


The baseline is still an average of 160 hours with a
variance of plus or minus 20 hours.


In a High Variance region, the length of a jump can be
plus or minus up to 60 hours, with variance of up to 120
hours possible in an Extreme Variance region.


In a Slow Jump region the base time for a jump may
be 200–300 hours (9–12 days) with Very Slow Jump
regions in the 400–600 hour (16–25 day) range.


A Fast Jump region typically has a baseline jump
time of 100–120 hours (4–5 days), with Very Fast
Jump regions requiring as little as 40–80 hours
(1.6–3.3 days) per jump.

154

###### THE JUMP DRIVE


Combinations are possible, such as fast jump/high
variance regions.

Jump variance is not well understood. Some
scientists believe that sparsity of stars (and therefore
lesser gravitational influence) can somehow affect
the time taken to make a jump. This does not
explain variation in areas with dense stellar clusters
however. Some areas of dense star systems have
shorter average jump duration than is typical and
some sparse regions require longer.

ALTERNATE JUMP OPERATIONS
Changing how the jump drive works can alter the
setting for a Traveller universe without requiring new
starships to be designed with different technology.
The classic Traveller starship designs can be used
unchanged in a universe where their performance
is altered but the size and fuel consumption of their
components is not.

Some or all of these options could be applied to the
entire setting, or perhaps the technology might be
restricted to one alien race or a single prototype built
by a crazed genius. If so, obtaining one of these
capabilities might be the goal of an entire campaign – or
it may enable the Travellers to do things others cannot
and therefore be a driving force in the universe.

**INSTANT JUMP**
Instant jump technology is a universe-changer and
should be implemented with caution. In the Third
Imperium universe the speed of communication
is limited by the rate at which ships could jump
from one star system to another with information.
Reducing jump time to zero, or to a short interval,
allows messages to be sent as fast as ships can
refuel and re-provision – faster if a ‘pony express’ of
ready couriers is maintained. This technology also
has strategic implications. Transferring a fleet from
one region to another could take months using the
standard jump drive. If it can be done in days instead,
the strategic picture will be altered.


An instant jump follows all the rules for normal jump
drives in terms of fuel requirements and distance that
can be covered. This does impose some limits on
travel, since ships still need to refuel, but explorers
will be able to push much farther out before fatigue
and a need for repairs to the ship require a return
to base. Thus an instant-jump universe will tend to
feature societies spread over a greater area – why
settle a hellhole of a world when there are garden
planets within a few days’ travel – with underdeveloped
backwaters in between the major worlds.


REAL-SPACE TRANSIT
Under this variant, the jump drive does not take a ship
entirely out of the ‘real’ universe. Instead, a ship can
proceed at a rate of one parsec per week per jump
number (so a jump-2 ship can cover two parsecs in
a week, or one parsec in 3.5 days) and can receive
communications or even change course during its
interstellar voyage. If fuel requirements are kept the
same then standard designs can be used unchanged.


High-jump ships offer faster travel, which has political
and economic implications. Bulk goods will be moved
aboard slow jump-1 freighters whilst faster ships carry
messages and priority cargo. It is possible to build a
low-jump ship with a great deal of fuel, making gaps
between mains and clusters less of a barrier. A ship still
needs fuel equal to 10% of its tonnage per parsec but
a jump-1 ship with 50% of its hull devoted to fuel tanks
can make five-parsec voyages – albeit slowly.


This allows an interstellar society to spread out
more evenly, rather than being heavily constrained
by astrography. Absolute distance becomes more
important than the presence of easily navigated mains
and clusters. For a band of Travellers with such a ship
in an otherwise standard universe, the implications
are considerable. They will be able to go places others
cannot reach without extensive prepositioning of fuel
or tankers and bypass choke points where enemies
are expecting to encounter them. The Travellers
will have a freedom of movement denied to others,
making them the only ones able to carry out some
missions or giving them a chance to avoid a response
after some nefarious deed.

## RAVELLING

## IN NORMAL SPACE

Getting from place-to-place is an integral part of
Traveller – as its very name suggests. Sometimes
the journey is a means to get to an adventure or
interesting incident; on other occasions the journey is
an adventure in its own right.

Traveller assumes that spacecraft use a reactionless
drive which does not directly require fuel. If the ship
has a working manoeuvre drive and its power plant
is functional (which does require fuel) then the ship
has thrust and can manoeuvre. Drives that require
reaction mass would require vastly more fuel than
standard manoeuvre drives. This would greatly limit
their range unless the ship spent most of its voyage
between planets coasting. It also makes navigation a
much more complex task.

The transit times given in the Traveller Core Rulebook,
and the formulae they are derived from (which also
appear in earlier versions of the game) assume a
vessel accelerating to the midway point of a journey
and then decelerating the rest of the way. This
requires constant thrust.

It is not, however, possible to exceed the speed of
light by these means. Lightspeed is bypassed by using
jumpspace to transit between points but this does not
require actually reaching the velocity of light either. In
fact, a ship can jump at any speed or on any heading

- it is not necessary to be aimed at the target in the
physical universe, only to set up the jump correctly.

A ship trying to reach lightspeed using the standard
manoeuvre drive will encounter time dilation effects
and an exponential increase in the amount of energy
required to increase speed. Once speed reaches a
significant fraction of the speed of light, it will take
much longer (i.e. the same thrust over a much greater
period of time) to increase speed further. Even with
a reactionless drive, it would take infinite time to
reach lightspeed. Indeed, accelerating beyond a
certain speed would be a death sentence for the
crew; if insufficient fuel remained to slow down again
they would be trapped aboard their hurtling starship,
unable to leave since any lifeboats launched would be
travelling at the same speed as the parent vessel.


WHERE DO WE WANT TO GO?
Spacecraft, starships, satellites and stations tend to be
in predictable places within a star system. It is possible
to run into a research ship out in the distant moons
of a gas giant, or a pirate vessel hiding somewhere
unexpected, but for the most part political, economic
and military factors all conspire to keep ships close to
inhabited worlds or transit corridors between them.


Orbital space around an inhabited world is the most
crowded region of a star system. If a world has no
atmosphere, it is theoretically possible to orbit at very
low altitude so long as the craft is going fast enough.
A stable orbit balances forces against a craft or object;
gravity pulls it towards the body but its velocity keeps it
in orbit. This can be thought of as a fast-moving object
falling in a curve that ends over the horizon.


An orbit can be circular or highly elliptical, so long
as the dynamic balance of forces is such that the
object neither crashes into the planet or escapes
into deep space. A craft with functioning drives can
apply course corrections at need and can force itself
to remain in a powered orbit that would not be stable
once the engines were cut off. More commonly,
craft will set up an orbit that will remain stable for a
reasonable period. This is partially for safety in case
of a drive malfunction and partly because orbital traffic
controllers do not like ships whizzing about all over
the place in their crowded area of operations.


Objects in low orbit will experience drag from the upper
layers of the atmosphere if the world has one, but this
is not large. Unpowered satellites can remain in low
Earth orbit for many years providing they are above an
altitude of about 400 kilometres. Low orbit for Earth is
considered to extend out to about 2,000 kilometres; in
the Traveller universe low orbit is typically defined as
within around 1,000–2,500 kilometres of the planetary
surface. Most highports and other space installations
are located around the upper limit of low orbit and a
common spacer’s rule of thumb is ‘anything lower than
the highport is in low orbit’.


Objects in low orbit cannot retain direct line-of-
sight contact to any fixed point on the ground. This
is not generally a problem if there are satellites or
other installations to bounce signals off. Most world
governments consider their low orbit zone to be
strategically important and those that can will usually
maintain some form of low-orbit defence capability.
This might be ground-based missiles or perhaps
a few fighters based at the highport in the case
of a minor world; major worlds tend to have much
stronger defences. Low-orbit traffic is also closely
regulated in most cases.

An object whose orbital period matches the rotation
of the planet below can maintain a geosynchronous
orbit, i.e. it is constantly over the same spot on the
ground, providing it follow’s the world’s equator.
This is useful for communications satellites but also
serves as a delineation point between medium and
high orbit. In systems where traffic is highly regulated
it is common for ships to request permission before
transiting between the High Orbit Zone (HOZ), Medium
Orbit Zone (MOZ) and Low Orbit Zone (LOZ). These
designations are arbitrary but useful.

Altitude for a geosynchronous orbit depends on the
planet’s speed of rotation and may be a theoretical
point for worlds with very slow or no rotation. For Earth
this point is an altitude of about 35,000 kilometres.
Beyond this, the HOZ is generally considered to extend
out to 10 times the equatorial diameter of the world.
This ‘10 diameters’ rule is another arbitrary but useful
distinction; most worlds consider anything within 10
diameters as being in their sovereign territory.

Almost all local activity takes place within 10
diameters. Stations and satellites are typically located
in low orbit, so most traffic is in that region with a
few vessels having business further out. Any craft
that goes beyond the 10 diameter limit is considered
to have left orbital space and is probably on its way
somewhere else. That might be another body in
the same system or the vessel might be making an
interstellar voyage. Ships enter and emerge from jump
beyond the 100-diameter limit, unless something has
gone wrong, so most vessels must transit in or out of
orbital space in order to make a jump.


For Earth, the safe 100-diameter jump limit is roughly
1,275,000 kilometres, a bit over three times the
distance from the surface to the Moon. Transit in and
out from a safe jump distance can be quite lengthy
and in a busy system there might be numerous ships
headed in and out at once. However, there is no single
‘jump point’ in a system so these ships will be spread
out over a huge volume of space. Other vessels are
just distant transponder dots on a navigational plot and
space can be quite lonely even this close to a planet.
Vessels making a long transit out to other worlds in the
same system may be very far from any assistance if
something goes wrong.


MOVEMENT AND NAVIGATION
Movement in normal space (i.e. not in jumpspace) is
governed by a set of well-understood physical laws.
An object that is moving will continue to move with the
same velocity (speed and direction) unless something
makes it change. Likewise, an object not moving
stays at rest unless something makes it start moving.
However, the object is acted upon by the gravitational
attraction of other objects. A small asteroid a long way
away exerts so little force that it can be discounted but
planets – especially gas giants – and the system’s stars
exert a more noticeable force.


Trying to go from one place to another in a straight line
is impossible in such an environment, as well as being
undesirable. Every object in a star system is in motion;
even the stars. It is normal when navigating to take
one of the system’s stars as a frame of reference and
ignore its motion – the movement of the system as a
whole relative to the rest of the galaxy is not significant
when delivering a cargo of supplies to a mining outpost
on one of the outer planets.


However, the orbital paths of various bodies in the
system cause their positions to change relative to one
another. Moving between any two of them requires
calculating where the target is going to be at time of
arrival and determining a path to get there efficiently.
It is possible to save some time by using the gravity
and motion of objects in the system to create a highly
efficient trajectory. Likewise, course changes for a new
destination are usually very inefficient – a ship close
to the new destination may actually take longer to turn
around and get there than one starting farther away but
calculating an efficient course from the outset.

###### TRAVELLING IN NOMAL SPACE


TRAVELLER


When a spacecraft applies thrust, its existing
vector (the direction and speed it is going) changes
gradually according to how much thrust is available
and the direction it is applied. Massive objects
require a lot more thrust to change speed or direction
but even a small amount will have an effect. This
can be useful, for example it is possible to launch a
probe in the direction of a distant planet and shut off
its drive; it will coast until it gets there. This can also
be dangerous – a vessel that is tumbling as a result
of an accident will keep tumbling forever unless
something stops it, and a ship without power close to
a star will fall into it unless somehow stopped.


Gravity has an effect on vessels and objects,
pulling them towards the source of the gravitational
field. If the correct speed and distance from a
planet or star can be determined, a vessel or other
object can be put into orbit; gravitational pull draws
it into a curved path around the gravity source but
is not enough to drag it down.


Note that most orbits are not circular. An ellipse
is more common and many orbits are imperfect,
requiring occasional corrections. An object in an
imperfect orbit may eventually escape and head
off into deep space or fall to the planet below, but
this does not happen quickly. A ship that has lost
power may remain in orbit for weeks, months... even
centuries. Only the most unstable orbits, or those that
brush the upper atmosphere, will decay quickly. For a
ship with plenty of fuel little of this matters; corrections
can be made as needed.


In deep space, away from gravitational fields, things are
simpler but still not easy. In an atmosphere, an aircraft
can bank and turn quickly, while ground vehicles use
friction with the ground to effect a similar fast turn. For a
space vessel, changing direction is a slower process.


Most space vessels have a main drive which applies
thrust in one direction, and smaller manoeuvring units
to point the ship. Changing direction is a matter of
realigning the ship and then using the main drive to
thrust in the chosen direction. However, the ship retains
momentum in whatever direction it was going and must
cancel this or include it in the new course calculations.


The former solution is fine for ships with fuel and
time to waste. When a direction change is wanted
the vessel flips 180° and thrusts until it has come to
a stop, then accelerates in the new direction. This is


crazily inefficient, so a good navigator calculates a
course well ahead of time to get the ship going where
needed with a minimum of thrust. This usually means
changing direction early and using local gravity fields.
A well-planned course saves a lot of fuel and time
compared to a seat-of-the pants approach, and combat
manoeuvres are even more fuel-intensive.


Note that it is possible for two objects or ships to be ‘at
rest relative to one another’ despite both moving. This
simply means they have the same course and speed.
Even if they are screaming towards a third object at
enormous speed, each would appear stationary to the
other – this makes docking much simpler!

ORBITAL MECHANICS AND

INTERPLANETARY TRAVEL


MADE SIMPLE
Transit times between bodies in a planetary system
can be important to an adventure. There are two
ways of dealing with this. One involves a great deal
of mathematics to model the relative motion of bodies
and the trajectory of a ship travelling between them.
The other is to use ballpark figures and adjust them as
necessary to fit the needs of the adventure.


For example, the average distance between Earth
and the Sun is 1 Astronomical unit (AU), or about
150,000,000 kilometres. Mars orbits an average
of 1.52 AU, or about 228,000,000 kilometres, from
the Sun. This does not mean that Earth and Mars
are 78,000,000 kilometres apart. Since both orbit
at different speeds, there are times when they are
relatively close together (in astronomical terms) and
others when they are on opposite sides of the sun.
The actual distance can thus vary between around
47,000,000 kilometres and 401,000,000 kilometres,
averaging about 225,000,000 kilometres.


Getting from Earth to Mars is not a simple matter of
crossing the distance between the two in a straight line.
In fact a space vessel needs to transit from where Earth
is now to where Mars is going to be when it arrives.
This can be further than the distance between the start
and end point, especially if the vessel needs to make
a course change along the way. Even ignoring orbital
eccentricity and other factors that could complicate
this calculation still further, a hard, number-crunching
approach will slow down a game unnecessarily.

158

###### TRAVELLING IN NOMAL SPACE


A far simpler approach is to take a ballpark figure for
distance between two points and randomise it a little.
If the resulting distance is more than the average then
the bodies are at points in their orbit where they are on
opposite sides of their primary. If the figure is low, then
the two bodies are in a favourable position.

The Interplanetary Distances table is based on orbital
paths of bodies in our own solar system, which
orbits a main-sequence star. They use an average
of minimum and maximum distances, which in turn
depend on the relative positions of the two bodies.
This means that distances between two outsystem
bodies can vary far more than the distance between
two inner-system planets.

**Interplanetary Distances**

another

Once a baseline value for distance is established,
the Referee should randomise the actual value. The
simplest way to do this is to roll 2D-2, creating a value
between 0 and 10 and multiply that by 5% and 1D
to determine positive or negative (1–3 positive, 4–6
negative). Add or subtract the percentage rolled to the
baseline distance to find the current value and apply
the transit times or the travel calculations from pages
152–3 of the Travellers Core Rulebook. This assumes
a constant acceleration/deceleration of course; a ship
that coasts much of the way will be far slower. The
Referee may allow the transit time to be decreased (or
increased, if the players are so inclined) by 1D percent
per point of Effect on an Astrogation check.


NOTE ON USING THE TRAVEL FORMULAE
The travel calculations in the Traveller Core
Rulebook use SI units. Using them is simply a matter
of putting numbers into a calculator but care must be
taken to use the right units.


In the formulae:


Distance is in metres. Multiply kilometres by 1,000 to
get the value in metres.
Time is in seconds. Divide Time by 3,600 to get the
value in hours and divide by 24 after that for days.
Acceleration is in metres per second. Multiply the
ship’s Thrust to get acceleration in metres per second.
Thrust 1 (1G) is actually about 9.81 metres per second
but 10 is close enough for our purposes.


For example, the Travellers want to know how long
a resupply ship will take to make the long haul out
from the mainworld to a mining outpost on a distant
gas giant moon. The Referee decides this is about
equivalent to going from Earth to Uranus, so takes
3,000,000,000 kilometres as the baseline distance.
His 2D-2 roll produces a result of 3 and the 1D roll
indicates this is a positive value. He thus adds 15% on
to the distance, for a value of 3,450,000,00 kilometres.


According to the travel formulae on page 152 of the
Traveller Core Rulebook, a Thrust 1 ship will take
326 hours, or about 13 days, to make the transit. A
jump-capable ship can do it in seven days, but a non-
starship is cheaper and can carry more cargo per trip.
More importantly, the Travellers now know they can
take some time off and still get to the outpost in time
to ambush the supply ship.

###### TRAVELLING IN NOMAL SPACE


# M INE WARFARE

Laying contact-detonated mines in open space is more
or less pointless. The chances of a ship encountering
one is infinitesimally small unless the minefield is so
incredibly dense that it would be detected a long way
off and would in any case be prohibitively expensive.

However, the idea of laying passive booby-traps to
deter ships from using an area of space remains an
attractive one. A minefield can act as a deterrent or
tripwire, indicating that a vessel is present without the
need to keep a patrol ship on station. Minefields are
useful in defending orbital space, where there is more
chance of a ship encountering one, although contact-
detonated mines are still of questionable value.

TYPES OF MINE
The typical space mine is of a CAPTOR (CAPtive
TORpedo) type and consists of a container-
launcher with basic sensors, which carries one
or more missiles or torpedoes. Mines can be set
to automatically launch weapons at any vessel in
proximity which does not transmit the correct codes,
or to make a challenge and/or warning before
firing. They can also, in many cases, be directly
commanded from a station or mine warfare vessel.

CAPTOR mines typically carry torpedoes rather than
missiles, as they are intended for local area defence
and denial rather than long-range combat. Standard
designs typically carry two or four torpedoes. Mines
are generally considered disposable and likely to be
destroyed once detected, so reloads are a waste
of resources. Once its munitions are expended, a


container-launcher can be recovered and re-armed if it
survives but since the main expense is its weapons, the
loss of the launcher is not significant.


Explosive mines are of little use in orbital or free
space but can be effective in an atmosphere. It is
not feasible to mine the atmosphere of terrestrial
planets because of the extreme low orbital mechanics
required but gas giants can be cheaply mined in
this manner. A suitably large detonation – often a
small nuclear device – can cause a shock wave that
will endanger nearby ships or cause a control loss.
However, the liberal seeding of nuclear munitions
across nearby space is generally frowned upon,
not least because there are those who are willing to
disarm and steal the mines for sale and use elsewhere.


CAPTOR mines have an attack range of Medium (out
to 10,000 kilometres) but are typically set to launch at
ranges of under 1,000 kilometres. This gives the target
virtually no chance to evade or respond other than by
point-defence fire against the salvo.


‘Breaking the kill chain’ is a common tactic for dealing
with minefields, destroying the mines before they can
fire. However, mines are a very small target if engaged
with starship weaponry, imposing DM-6 on attacks.
Typically, the mine will expend all its torpedoes in one
attack, making it pointless to fire at it after launch.


A salvo of torpedoes uses the usual missile rules.
Mine-launched torpedoes are Smart weapons and deal
6D of damage.


**CAPTOR MINES**
A CAPTOR mine is armed with two, four or six torpedoes
in disposable container-launchers, plus a basic
electronics pack that allows it to detect, track and launch
at targets within 10,000 kilometres (Medium range).
Mine-launched torpedoes are subject to the usual DM-2
to attack ships under 2,000 tons, except when launching
from within 1,000 kilometres. At this short range the
torpedo can be fired directly at the target’s projected
position, and with a short transit time to target there is
little chance for manoeuvres to throw off the mine’s aim.
The tonnage of the mine is determined by its missile
capacity. If a mine is to be reloaded, the cost is Cr50000
per torpedo plus the cost of the weapons themselves
(Cr150000 each a standard torpedo).

**NUCLEAR PROXIMITY MINES**
A nuclear proximity mine is a one-shot weapon
armed with a small nuclear warhead and a very basic
electronics package. Such weapons are prohibited
in most areas, other than for military use. They are
useful mainly where there is an atmosphere to create
a blast effect. A nuclear detonation will create an
electromagnetic pulse (EMP) which will disrupt sensor
and electronic systems; the round after a nuclear
detonation occurs, all checks involving electronic
systems are made with DM-6 by the target ship unless
it has hardened computer systems. The DM increases
(goes up) by +2 each round thereafter. A nuclear
detonation can white out sensors and cause a temporary
control loss which can be lethal in a dangerous
environment such as a gas giant’s atmosphere.

Within an atmosphere such as that of a gas giant, a
nuclear detonation will also produce a pressure wave
which can damage a starship. Damage is 6D within 100
kilometres, dropping by 1D per 100 kilometres thereafter.


Weapons of this sort are extremely crude and of limited
use but the threat of their presence can be enough to
make vessels avoid a gas giant for refuelling.


NUCLEAR LASER MINES
Nuclear laser mines use a small nuclear warhead to
‘pump’ a one-shot x-ray laser. Effective range is short
but the weapon is powerful compared to standard
lasers and has greater reach than a simple proximity
bomb. The laser suffers DM-2 to hit a moving target
beyond 10,000 kilometres and has a maximum range
of 25,000 kilometres. These ranges are reduced by ¾
if deployed in an atmosphere. Radiation effects (and
blast effect if used in a gas giant atmosphere) are the
same as nuclear proximity mines. Damage from a
nuclear-powered laser is 5D.


MINEFIELD DENSITY
Torpedo-armed mines have a large danger radius but
at orbital distances there is still a great deal of space
to cover. The density of a minefield determines the
chance of encountering a mine. A vessel that spends
an extended time in the minefield much check every 1D
hours to see if a mine is encountered.


The Minefield Density table indicates the number of
mines required per planetary Size digit to create a
field of a given density. Small gas giants are treated
as being Size 50; large gas giants are Size 150 for the
purposes of minelaying operations.


The Pilot check to avoid encountering a mine is
subject to DM+2 if the Travellers’ vessel is under 100
tons displacement. There is no modifier for a ship
above this but below 1,000 tons in displacement.
The check is made at DM-2 if the Travellers’ ship is
1,000–10,000 tons in displacement and DM-4 for
ships above 10,000 tons.


Mine Cost (MCr) Tonnage TL Hull Points
CAPTOR Mine, Small (2 torpedoes) 0.5 1 10 2
CAPTOR Mine, Medium (4 torpedoes) 0.8 2 10 3
CAPTOR Mine, Large (6 torpedoes) 1.1 2.5 10 5
Nuclear Proximity Mine* 0.25 1 7 4
Nuclear Laser Mine* 0.75 1.5 8 4

* Although nuclear mines are relatively cheap, they are difficult to obtain and highly illegal for civilians, and subject to many
treaties for military use.

**Minefield Density**


Field Density Difficulty


Mines Per Size
Digit Required
Minimal Simple (2+) 1
Thin Easy (4+) 2
Light Routine (6+) 3
Standard Average (8+) 5
Dense Difficult (10+) 10
Extremely Dense Very Difficult (12+) 15


This check assumes the Travellers are unaware of the
minefield. Once the field is detected or a mine has been
encountered, the Travellers may attempt to evade the
minefield. If they simply go about their business, new
checks to encounter mines are made every 1D hours.


For example, a 20,000 ton naval tanker enters
the atmosphere of a large gas giant, intending
to skim fuel. There are 2,000 mines in the upper
atmosphere. Taking the gas giant’s Size as 150,
this means that 1,500 would be needed for a dense
field and 2,250 for an extremely dense one. Thus
the field is dense, requiring a Difficult check to
avoid accidentally encountering a mine. The check
is made at DM-4 for the size of the ship. Once the
first attack has taken place, the Travellers can begin
trying to find a way through the field.

MINES AND MINELAYING


EQUIPMENT
Mines can be manually laid by pushing them out
of an open cargo bay into the area where they
are wanted, then remotely controlling the mine to
orient itself. This is a slow process, requiring 2Dx10
minutes per mine to be laid. However, specialist
minelaying equipment is available.


MINELAYER BAY
A minelayer bay can be fitted as a small bay weapon,
requiring one hardpoint, one crewmember and 50
tons. A minelayer bay can deploy mines of any size
at the rate of one every 2D minutes. A minelayer
bay costs MCr1.5 but does not contain any mines.
Additional tonnage must be allocated to carry mines,
at a cost of Cr10000 per ton. Thus a ship with 20 tons
of mine stowage can carry 20 small CAPTOR mines
or eight large ones, at a cost of Cr200000.

DETECTING AND EVADING


MINEFIELDS
Some minefields are surrounded by warning beacons,
in which case Travellers will be made aware of the
mines before they approach. Of course, the warning
may be false or the beacons disabled for some reason.
If there is no warning, a vessel can try to detect the
minefield early enough to avoid attack.


Detecting a minefield requires an Average (8+)
Electronics (sensors) check, increasing to Difficult
(10+) if the field is located within a gas giant’s upper
atmosphere. This check indicates the presence of
something that looks like a minefield but does not
pinpoint the position of any given mine. To map a
minefield or find a way through without coming within
range of a mine requires a Difficult (10+) Electronics
(sensors) check, increasing to Very Difficult (12+)
within a gas giant’s atmosphere. Alternatively, a ship
can try to inch through the field attempting to detect
individual mines as it goes and move around them.
This is a very slow process, with each mine requiring
2Dx5 minutes to detect and bypass. 1D mines will
typically be encountered in the course of slipping
through a minefield. Detecting each one early
enough to avoid attack requires an Average (8+)
Electronics (sensors) check, increased to Difficult
(10+) within a gas giant’s atmosphere.


If any mine detects the Travellers’ ship, it will attack
with one or more torpedoes or detonate if it is a nuclear
proximity mine. The whole minefield will then go to
high alert, imposing DM-2 on all attempts to detect and
avoid mines. In some cases, the mines of a field may
communicate with one another and set up a massed
salvo sufficient to overwhelm the defences of a target
vessel and annihilate it. This will be coordinated by a
burst transmission which may be detected.

# G AS GIANT OPERATIONS

Skimming fuel from a gas giant is a common practice,
requiring a rapid transit through the upper atmosphere
to force gases into a scoop. These are then processed
to extract hydrogen which is compressed until
sufficient liquid hydrogen is available for use as fuel.
Skimming is a common means of refuelling a fleet
before advancing to attack a target world – going into
action with dry tanks means the fleet cannot escape
by jumping away from a bad situation.

Not surprisingly, many powers seek to deny the
enemy this capability, and on a smaller scale patrol
vessels are often stationed at a gas giant to catch
pirates or other criminals trying to avoid the starports.
This can result in a dangerous game of cat-and-
mouse in a gas giant’s atmosphere.

A gas giant’s atmosphere can be considered to
consist of layers of increasing density. These are
usually separated by temperature inversions which
can interfere with the operation of a ship’s sensors.
The deeper layers of a gas giant’s atmosphere
are inaccessible to starships as the pressure and
turbulence encountered there would destroy any
known ship. However, the upper layers can be used
for skimming or to conceal a ship.

As a general rule, the deeper in the atmosphere a
ship goes, the harder it is to detect and the faster
it can fill its tanks with liquid hydrogen. However,
turbulence is greater at these depths, imposing
difficulties in controlling the ship.

1 – Wisp: The outer layer of a gas giant’s atmosphere
is too thin to skim for fuel or fully conceal a ship but
does impose some drag on a vessel or object in orbit.
Powered course corrections from time-to-time will be
necessary to prevent an orbit from decaying, although
this is likely to take days or even weeks to become a
serious problem. A ship that loses power in the Wisp
zone has plenty of time to repair its systems.


2 – Extreme Shallow: The upper layers of the
atmosphere are not subject to much turbulence. It
is possible to skim fuel in the extreme shallows but
it will take 10 times as long as in the Deep zone.
Power loss will result in orbital decay in 8D hours.
There are no serious turbulence effects at this level
and no penalty to Pilot checks.


3 – Shallow: The Shallows are reasonably safe to
operate in and allow skimming for fuel at half the
normal rate. Orbital decay will occur in 2D hours if
power is lost. All Pilot checks are made with DM-1
in the Shallows.


4 – Deep: Fuel skimming and commercial exploitation
such as petrochemical harvesting is normally done in
the Deep zone. Skimming is at the normal rate and
conditions tend to be sufficiently turbulent that Pilot
checks are made with at DM-2. A vessel that loses
power in the Deeps will start to fall immediately, hitting
the top of the Extreme Deep layer in 2D minutes.


5 – Extreme Deep: Few vessels venture into the
Extreme Deeps other than specially built research
craft and warships optimised for hiding in a gas giant’s
atmosphere. Turbulent conditions impose DM-3 on all
Pilot checks. A vessel without power in the Extreme
Deeps will be tossed about by incredible winds,
suffering 2D damage every round. It will fall to the top
of the Depths in 2D minutes.


6 – Depths: Very few vessels have returned from the
Depths of any gas giant world. Any ship at this depth,
other than those specially constructed to survive there,
suffers 2D damage each round, increasing to 6D if the
ship is unstable due to power loss. A vessel will enter
the Abyssal Depths in 2D minutes if falling without
power. All Pilot checks are made at DM-4 in the Depths.


TRAVELLER


7 – Abyssal Depths: The technology required to build
a ship capable of operating in the Abyssal Depths
is beyond most starfaring species. The incredible
pressures and turbulence inflict 4D damage per round
on any vessel venturing there. The pressure is so
great at this depth that pools of liquid hydrogen can be
encountered near the bottom. Some gas giants have
a rocky or metallic core; others simply a high-pressure
world-ocean of hydrogen. A ship that hits the bottom of
a gas giant’s atmosphere will be destroyed quickly. All
Pilot checks are made at DM-5 in the Abyssal depths
and sensor systems will not function.


ADDITIONAL FACTORS
All gas giants have a turbulent atmosphere. One that is
unusually active will impose an additional DM-2 on all
Pilot checks made in the atmosphere. Particularly violent
giants impose DM-4. These worlds are rarely skimmed
for fuel, except by the most desperate of crews.


CROSSING THE LAYERS
The layers of a gas giant’s atmosphere may expand
and contract depending on local temperature
conditions, causing the boundaries to move
considerably. It is possible for a layer boundary to
move rapidly up or down, causing it to impinge upon
a starship maintaining a constant altitude. However,
more commonly a ship will deliberately cross from one
layer to another to avoid detection or reach a suitable
altitude for fuel skimming.


Crossing from one layer to another, up or down,
requires an Average (8+) Pilot check with the largest
negative DM for depth applied. Success indicates the
ship has successfully crossed to the new layer without
much more than some buffeting. In the event of failure,
the ship fails to cross the layer and is bounced back
with considerable violence. A second Pilot check,
this one at Difficult (10+) difficulty and subject to the
DM for the layer the ship is currently in, is required to
avoid damage. If this check is failed, the ship suffers a
number of dice in damage equal to the number of the
layer it is trying to enter. So, a ship trying to enter the
Deep layer and failing, suffers 4D Hull damage unless
the pilot can succeed the second check.


FUEL SKIMMING
Fuel skimming takes a number of ‘passes’, during
which the ship opens its scoops and forces gas into
them by moving fast through the atmosphere – or by
simply pointing into the wind. A ship can skim fuel equal
to 1% of its hull tonnage per pass, with a pass typically
requiring 2D minutes. Thus, a vessel wanting to obtain
20% of its hull tonnage in fuel in the Deep layer will
need 20 passes averaging about seven minutes each,
for a total of 140 minutes. Skimming would take twice
as long in the Shallow layer but would also be safer.


SENSORS AND COMBAT
Sensors and beam weapons are attenuated in the thick
atmosphere of a gas giant. All checks to detect another
vessel are subject to DM-2 for each layer the ships are
apart. Thus, a system defence boat patrolling the Wisp
layer suffers DM-4 to spot a pirate ship hiding from
it in the Shallow layer. It is common to seed sensor
drones in gas giant atmospheres to offset this problem.
Drones are very short-lived in the Deep zone, so tend
to be positioned in the higher areas. Ships with access
to drones can be considered to be sensing from the
Wisp, Extreme Shallows or Shallow areas; whichever is
most beneficial. A ship outside the Wisp zone, with no
access to sensor drones, would suffer DM-2 for each
layer down the target was hiding.


Energy-based weapon ranges are halved for every
layer the firing ship is down and each dice of damage is
reduced by one point per layer the ship is down. Thus,
a vessel firing a pulse laser in the Deep zone does only
2D-8 damage if it hits.


Missiles and torpedoes do full damage in a gas
giant atmosphere but may be destroyed if they cross
between layers. Weapons designed for use in these
conditions (e.g. torpedoes used in mines seeded in
an atmosphere) can safely cross between layers on a
straight Routine (6+) check. For standard missiles and
torpedoes, this is an Average (8+) check. However, this
does not apply when shooting into the Wisp, Extreme
Shallows, or Shallow layers; ships in these areas can
be attacked normally by missiles fired from outside the
atmosphere, making the positioning of other vessels in
a high guard position extremely important.

## RANSPONDERS,

## REGISTRY AND MORTGAGES

The device known as a transponder aboard a
starship is more than an automatic identification-and-
communication system. It is a complex security system
which contains (supposedly) tamper-proof information
on the ship’s status, registry and ownership.

The transponder itself is intended to automatically
identify the ship whenever it is ‘pinged’ or
communications are made. The transponder
automatically appends the ship’s name, port of registry
and class to every communication, recorded along with
the communication itself by the receiving vessel.

Transponders can operate in one of four modes,
although not all are available to some users.

Active: The transponder sends out a ‘ping’ every few
seconds, containing the ship’s basic data. This mode is
used in safe areas where there is no need for a vessel
to avoid detection. An active transponder advertises the
ship’s presence to other vessels, enabling early course
changes to avoid the risk of collision.

Passive: The transponder does not ‘ping’ but will
respond if pinged by another transponder. This mode
is used where shipowners would prefer to remain
inconspicuous as much as possible, such as in
frontier systems where piracy is common. Starports
typically maintain an active ping, which reveals
vessels as they approach.

IFF: Identification-Friend-or-Foe mode is used only
by naval and paramilitary vessels. The transponder
will not respond unless it receives a ping from a
transponder with the correct challenge codes.
Responses are low-power and directional, reducing
the chance of detection. Although IFF does serve to
tell friendly craft from potential hostiles, it is primarily
used for squadron station-keeping and small craft
operations, allowing members of the same force
to track one another and maintain station without
alerting all ships in the area to their presence. An IFF-
mode transponder will not respond automatically to
a challenge from another system that does not have
the right codes but will alert the operator and give the
opportunity to authorise a response.


Covert: It is not generally possible to turn off a
transponder, at least not without modifying it somehow.
However, it is possible to activate ‘covert’ mode. This
prevents the transponder from responding when pinged
and is used in an emergency to hide from hostiles.
Any activation of covert mode is automatically entered
into the ship’s logs and will have to be explained if the
log is examined. Most civilian ships have an override
code built into their transponder which will respond
to an interrogative pulse from a suitably equipped
vessel even in covert mode. Naval vessels have this
capability, although its effectiveness depends on which
codes have been supplied. When the override codes
for shipping in the region fall into the wrong hands, they
have to be changed as no merchant vessel can hide
from a pirate who can simply ask their ship where it is.


The transponder will also respond to an interrogative
pulse from a suitably equipped vessel with a short
version of the ship’s logs. This is simply a set of
validation codes indicating when a ship docked at a
starport and when it left, and an indication of when it
jumped and re-entered normal space (but not where).
The ‘short log’ as it is known is automatically updated
with port codes at Class A and B ports. Most Class C
and some Class D ports also supply a code. A ship
with a few gaps in its port entry and exit code log will
not be seen as suspicious but the short log can be
used by patrol vessels to identify ships that might
reward a boarding and search.


One other piece of data carried by a ship’s
transponder is its mortgage status. It can be difficult
for a ship working the backwaters to make mortgage
payments on time, so this function is handled by the
transponder’s dedicated computer system. Payments
can be made electronically to an internal escrow
account, a one-way transaction; the mortgage payment
fund cannot normally be accessed by the crew. When
the ship enters a port tied into the interstellar banking
system, its transponder system delivers the payment
which is then forwarded to the recipient. Most Class A
and B ports have this capability.


TRAVELLER


If no payment is received for a long time, the mortgage
holder might declare the ship suspect and put out an
alert. However, it may simply be that the mortgage
payment is sitting in the internal escrow account waiting
for suitable planetfall. If this is the case, the ship’s
transponder will indicate that payments are available
and patrol vessels will not flag the vessel as ‘skipped’.


A skip alert will attract the attention of skip tracers and
other official or freelance investigators, who can be a
nuisance for the crew. The alert can be cancelled at a
suitably equipped starport, even if the payment will take
time to reach the mortgage holder. Delays of this sort
can be exploited at both ends but for the most part the
system works well enough.


TRANSPONDER MODIFICATIONS
The transponder can be modified, although this is
illegal. The most common modifications are to remove
a mortgage default flag from the code or disable the
automatic response system. The latter allows the ship
to run completely ‘dark’ and prevents any ship from
overriding the transponder. It is normally used by
smugglers and pirates, and being caught with a dead
transponder will require a lot of explaining.


Disabling the transponder can be done without
reprogramming it, although removing all the tie-ins
and connections to the communications system is a
lengthy business. A physical disconnect, usually with
an on/off switch in a concealed location, will take 2D
days of work to accomplish and requires a Difficult
(10+) Electronics (comms) check. Failure indicates the
system is still partially active and will respond to pings
in a garbled fashion guaranteed to attract attention.


Reprogramming the transponder is a tricky business
but once completed the Travellers will have control over
the device. They can remove a default flag or alter the
short logs without difficulty once the security is cracked.
Other changes, such as setting up a fake transponder
identity, are lengthy tasks in their own right.


Cracking the security is a Formidable (14+)
Electronics (computers) check requiring 2D3 days of
work. Highly illegal toolkits containing ready-prepared
software patches are said to be available but these
are hard to come by and tend to be tailored to one
specific type of vessel. Once security is breached,
changes can be made but each change requires
a Difficult (10+) Electronics (computers) check to
accomplish without leaving traces. If this check is
failed, any interrogation of the transponder beyond a
standard passing vessel ping will indicate the logs or
transponder response have been doctored.


A ship can have more than one false identity
programmed into its transponder. Setting this up
requires a Very Difficult (12+) Electronics (computers)
check and takes D3 days. This must be accompanied
by a successful Average (8+) Admin check to invent
a plausible identity. If the Admin check is failed, the
ship’s identity will seem implausible or ‘thin’, although
this may well be enough to get by in the backwaters.
Failing the Electronics check results in a garbled mess
of code which will have to be restarted.


Transponder packages are sometimes sold on the
black market, usually for upwards of MCr1 each. Some
are copied from real ships, others custom-prepared.
A few are stolen from Naval Intelligence, having been
created for covert-operations vessels, which can lead
to complications when someone tries to use one.

Transponders, Registry and Mortgages


# M ISSILES AND TORPEDOES

In regions where missiles and torpedoes are popular
weapons, vessels are often designed with both heavy
anti-missile defences and the capability to saturate the
defences of another ship using a huge salvo. The key
to a saturation attack is simply number of weapons
arriving at once – the same number spread over a few
rounds might be defeated by point defences. Likewise,
the best defence against a saturation attack is to thin it
out early with antimissile fire from escorting craft, then
stop the last few ‘leakers’ with point-defence fire.

Defence against a large missile salvo might therefore
take place in several stages – interception by area-
defence missiles, interception by dogfight missiles and
finally point-defence fire. An escorting ship can provide
point-defence fire for its charge with beam weapons
and can, of course, engage incoming missiles with
dogfight or area-defence missiles.

**DOGFIGHT MISSILES (POINT-DEFENCE)**
A dogfight missile is a smaller version of the standard
anti-shipping missile, optimised for fast response at
close range. Dogfight missiles can be carried on a rail
aboard a fighter or small craft rather than in standard
missile launchers, with two missiles carried per
firmpoint. Dogfight missiles have a maximum range
of Close but gain an additional DM+4 to attack within
this range (this includes when they are used with the
Point Defence reaction, as detailed on page 160 of the
Traveller Core Rulebook). Damage is 1D, making the
missile ineffective against anything larger than a fighter
or missile. This is not a drawback; dogfight missiles are
often used to intercept incoming missiles and torpedoes
or deal with small craft.

If carried as anti-missile or anti-small craft weapons
by a vessel with conventional hardpoints, four dogfight
missiles take up the same amount of space as one
standard missile. They can only be launched at the
same rate as normal, however, so a double missile rack
turret can still only fire two missiles at once whether
they are ship-killers or dogfight missiles. Dogfight
missiles used in this manner are sometimes termed
point-defence missiles but are essentially the same
weapons as carried by fighters, just on a larger mount.


The use of dogfight missiles allows an incoming salvo
or flight of fighters to be engaged and thinned out
before point defence fire.


Weapon TL Thrust Damage Cost Traits
Dogfight
Missile


10 14 1D Cr75000 Smart


Interceptor
Missile


10 12 2D Cr125000 Smart


INTERCEPTOR MISSILES (AREA DEFENCE)
Interceptor missiles, sometimes referred to as area
defence missiles, are designed to intercept incoming
weapons before they get close to the target. Two
interceptor missiles take up the same amount of
space as one standard missile, although they can
only be launched at the same rate. Damage is 2D
and the weapon gains a DM+2 to attack in addition
to other factors. If carried on a small craft’s firmpoint,
one interceptor missile can be carried on a rail, or a
standard missile rack can be used.


Interceptor missiles have a maximum range of Short.


TRAVELLER


CONTAINER-LAUNCHERS
A conventional missile rack mounted in a turret contains
12 missiles (four on a small craft firmpoint). These
are loaded one at a time into the launcher. Container-
launchers offer a greater ‘surge’ missile capacity,
although once expended they cannot be reloaded in
time to fire again in a typical combat.


A container-launcher can be fitted on a hardpoint (not
a firmpoint) and contains four missiles or one torpedo
in a ready-to-launch configuration. These can be fired
individually or all at once, enabling a craft to make a
single overwhelming missile attack.


The container-launcher system costs Cr50000 plus the
cost of weapons (for standard missiles this is Cr250000
each) and can be used aboard any ship that has other
missile weapons such as a turret-mounted missile
rack. Ships that do not have such weaponry lack the
requisite electronics for arming and guidance, which
must be fitted at a cost of Cr150000.


Container-launchers are used on some military ships to
create a surge capacity for missile combat, or to carry
additional interceptor or dogfight missiles. As usual, one
standard missile can be replaced with two interceptors
or four dogfight missiles and can be launched all at
once if desired. These systems are also used by civilian
ships as a deterrent or to facilitate an escape as an
attacker deals with a swarm of missiles.


CONDUCTING MISSILE COMBAT
When a ship is under missile attack, defence is
conducted in stages. Area defence can be conducted by
any ship within range or along the ‘threat axis’ between
the target and launching platforms. This is typically
the target and any escorts or screening fighters. Area
defence is conducted using interceptor missiles.


Each interceptor missile can target one incoming
missile or torpedo. Each hit destroys one missile.
Torpedoes are tougher – each successful hit will
destroy a torpedo on a 1D roll of 4+.


Point defence can then be conducted by the target
ship and any close escorts it may have. Each dogfight
missile launched can target one missile or torpedo. A
dogfight missile will destroy a missile on a 1D roll of a
3+ and a torpedo on a 5+.


Close-in defence is the last chance to stop missiles
and is conducted with beam weapons, point defence
clusters and the like. The surviving missiles in a salvo
are targeted as per the point defence rules on page
162 of the Traveller Core Rulebook. Any that survive
these layers of defence and any attempts at electronic
warfare may attack the target ship.


ESCORTS
A vessel may also be protected from missile or small
craft attack by close escorts. A close escort acts as a
‘goalkeeper’ for the target ship, firing at missiles and
small craft as they fly past. If the attacker attempts a
‘rollback’ strategy whereby the escorts are targeted
first, this leaves the big ships unengaged in which case
the escorts are still doing their job. Close escorts can
only engage threats to their charge, otherwise they
cease to be acting in the close escort role. Returning
to this role from another operation requires 1D combat
rounds to move back into position.


A vessel cannot have more than 10% of its tonnage as
close escorts. This tonnage can be made up of small
craft or starships, or any mix of both.


Close escorts can target incoming small craft, missiles
or torpedoes with their weapons, or with dogfight
missiles. Each close escort, fighter, or small craft can
target one missile per dogfight missile launched, plus
at least one with its guns. Small craft with multiple
weapons gain DM+1 to attack per additional weapon
but can still only target one missile each. Larger vessels
may target one threat (missile, torpedo or small craft)
per turret and gain DM+1 per additional weapon in the
turret to their attack rolls. Hits destroy missiles and
torpedoes are tougher – each successful hit will destroy
a torpedo on a 1D roll of 4+. Attacks with weapons
other than guided missiles suffer DM-2 to attack when
targeting threats directed against another vessel.


It is a common tactic for some ships in a task force to
act as ‘force escorts’, positioned between high-value
vessels and likely threats. Force escorts carry out
area defence with interceptor missiles, after which an
incoming salvo is engaged by close escorts and then
the target itself using point defence weapons (dogfight
missiles and the guns of close escorts) before the
target itself finally engages in close-in defence with its
short-range weapons.

## ECTOR-BASED

## SPACE COMBAT

The Space Combat chapter of the Traveller Core
Rulebook provides a relatively simple and exciting way
to resolve deadly fights between spacecraft. However,
there are certain limitations to the rules presented there.

The rules do not allow spacecraft to retain momentum
from one space combat round to the next. Thrust is
instead abstracted as a maximum speed per combat
round. In a game where ships may accelerate
continuously for many hours when travelling to or from
the 100-diameter jump limit or another planet in the
same system – before turning around and decelerating
continuously, starting at the halfway point until they
reach their destination – many battles could involve
ships moving at very high speeds.


When several ships are involved in a fight, they may
wish to travel in directions other than straight towards
or directly away from their adversaries, or multiple ships
may start a battle from widely-separated areas. Thus, a
system that only tracks range along a one-dimensional
axis prevents realistic ranges from being calculated
among the various participants.


The purpose of these supplementary rules are to add the
ability to calculate range between any number of ships
in a space combat scenario by using a map, and to allow
the accumulation of velocity over time. Suggestions
for using a physical map and virtual tabletops (VTTs)
are included. That said, some elements of realism are
ignored for the purposes of simplicity:

- Combat (like interstellar maps in Traveller) is
    treated as two-dimensional — all ships and
    interstellar bodies are treated as being on the
    same flat plane.
- Spacecraft facing is ignored. It is assumed that ships
    may pivot to any needed direction over the course
    of each six-minute space combat round, even when
    expending their full Thrust during a round.
- A map using either hexagons or squares is used
    and spacecraft are generally treated as being in
    the centre of the space they occupy.
- Simplifications have been made to the movement
    of missiles to avoid adding unmanageable levels of
    complexity during combat scenarios that may have
    many salvoes seeking targets simultaneously.
- The gravitational effects of large bodies are
    ignored, since Traveller assumes that spacecraft
    capable of only Thrust 1 are able to move freely in
    the gravity wells of planets.


These rules may be viewed as an add-on to the Space
Combat chapter, with each round divided into steps:
Manoeuvre, Attack and Actions. Steps are further
divided into phases.


TRAVELLER


The primary methods employed to achieve vector-
based space combat are:

- Instead of using Range Bands, the position of each
    ship and object is tracked on a map. Hexagonal
    maps are preferred but a square grid can be used,
    and the term ‘space’ is used to denote a single hex
    or square. The map scale is such that each point
    of Thrust applied modifies a spacecraft’s speed
    by one space per round in a given direction. The
    current vector (speed and direction of movement)
    is tracked for each ship.
- During each Manoeuvre step, an Acceleration
    phase is added immediately before the Movement
    phase, in which each ship declares the changes to
    its current vector.
- Because of the scale of the map, specific rules are
    added for entering into dogfighting range and for
    determining the firing range of spacecraft passing
    close to one another during a round.


MAP SETUP
There are two initial decisions to be made when setting
up a map for vector-based space combat: whether a
physical or virtual map is to be used and whether to
use squares or hexagons as the spaces on the map.
Each have advantages and disadvantages.


A physical map can be ideal for playing in-person
but the size may become challenging when a battle
involves ships with high acceleration or when the
battle takes place over a wide area. VTT software
such as Roll20 can allow you to make maps of any
size, although VTTs can struggle when a map is overly
large. VTT maps also provide a way to easily measure
distances and track speed and direction numbers on
virtual tokens so they can be seen by all Travellers.


A map using squares allows speed to be tracked in
two perpendicular directions, the traditional Cartesian
X and Y axes, with positive numbers indicating
movement in the ‘north’ and ‘east’ directions and
negative numbers for ‘south’ and ‘west’. Hexagonal
axes effectively have three ‘axes’. We recommend
orienting the hexes such that one axis provides a
straight line between the major opposing sides and
treating that as the X axis, and using the ‘northwest/
southeast’ line as your Y axis. In this way, movement
in the third axis can be treated as a positive or
negative combination of the X and Y axes. Whether
using hexagons or squares, speeds can be recorded
in the format (X, Y), where X and Y are replaced with
the positive or negative speed along those axes.

###### Vector-Based Space Combat


**USING A SQUARE GRID**
For example, on a square map, a ship starting at rest
and expending Thrust 4 could set their speed as follows:

- To move as fast as possible towards the ‘east’, it
    would apply Thrust 4 in the positive-X direction,
    resulting in a speed of (4, 0).
- To move as fast as possible in the ‘northwest’
    direction, it would apply Thrust 2 in the negative-X
    direction, and Thrust 2 in the positive-Y direction,
    resulting in a speed of (-2, 2).
- To move in a somewhat ‘east-by-northeast’
    direction, it could apply Thrust 3 in the positive-X
    direction and Thrust 1 in the positive-Y direction,
    resulting in a speed of (3, 1).


USING A HEX GRID
On a hexagonal map using a horizontally oriented X
axis and northwest-southeast direction as the Y axis, a
similar (but not identical) set of movements is possible:

- Moving as fast as possible in the eastward
    direction is the same: apply Thrust 4 in the
    positive-X direction, resulting in a speed of (4, 0).
- Moving as fast as possible in a roughly ‘southeast’
    direction would simply mean applying Thrust 4
    in the negative-Y direction and none in the X
    direction, resulting in a speed of (0, -4).


171

###### Vector-Based Space Combat


TRAVELLER


USING THE Z AXIS
Movement on a hexagonal map along the third axis can
be thought of in two ways: either treat this as a ‘Z’ axis
(ignoring the fact that in Cartesian coordinates, the Z
axis denotes the ‘up-down’ vertical axis with respect
to the X and Y axes), with ‘northeast’ as the positive
direction and ‘southwest’ as the negative direction, or
treat Thrust applied along this axis as a combination of
Thrust applied in the X and Y directions simultaneously.
For example:

- If using a third ‘Z’ axis, speed is recorded as three
    numbers instead of two, and thus our ship applying
    Thrust 4 in the ‘northeast’ direction records its
    speed as (0, 0, 4)
- If treating ‘Z-axis’ movement as a combination
    of Thrust in the X and Y directions, it records
    the same speed as (4, 4) – this makes it seem
    like it has expended a total of Thrust 8 but it
    is understood that this is just how to denote
    movement in that direction. If the same ship
    wanted to apply Thrust 4 such that it ended up
    three hexes to the ‘northeast’ and one additional
    hex to the ‘east’, it would apply Thrust 3 in the
    positive-X/Y direction for a speed of (3, 3), and
    then apply one additional Thrust in the positive-X
    direction, resulting in a total speed of (4, 3).

172

###### Vector-Based Space Combat



When using a VTT, set the map scale to 648 kilometres
per square or hex and if possible, set the measuring
tool to use Euclidean measurement, rather than
counting squares or hexes. If this is not an option, then
counting hexes is acceptable for a hex map and for
a map of squares, the next most accurate results will
result by setting diagonal distances to 1.5 squares.


This means that in order to be at Adjacent or Close
range, ships must occupy the same space, and other
ranges are as follows for either squares or hexes:

In subsequent rounds, Thrust may be applied to
add to or subtract from a ship’s current vector, in
any combination. For example, a ship with Thrust 4,
currently moving at a vector of (4, -2), might apply
Thrust 4 to its X-axis movement, changing its vector
to (8, -2). Alternatively, it might maintain its movement
along the X axis and reverse Thrust along the Y-axis,
changing its vector to (4, 2) if all four of its Thrust is
used to do so. Or it could split the Thrust 4 between the
X and Y axes, resulting in vectors such as (6, -4), (3,
-5), or (1, -1). In later rounds, vectors can be increased
further and further until ships are moving at very high
speed. This adds a level of complexity and strategy that
should make battles very engaging.

MAP SCALES
The default scale for a space combat map, whether
using squares or hexagons, is 648 kilometres per
space, as this is the distance travelled by a spacecraft
acceleration at 1G continuously for the duration of a
six-minute space combat round. This allows speeds to
be calculated easily when applying Thrust: each point
of Thrust increases or decreases speed by one space
per round in a given direction, whether X, Y, or either Z
or X/Y when using a hex map.


Range Band Range in spaces
Adjacent or Close 0 (same space)
Short 1 (or 2, see below)
Medium 15
Long 38
Very Long 77
Distant 78 or more


A map size of 100 spaces or more in the ‘long’
direction (assuming a rectangular map) is helpful to
provide enough room for ships to close from (or flee
to) Distant range. However, if all ships in the combat
are relatively slow (Thrust 1 or 2 maximum) and it
makes more narrative sense to start them closer
together, a smaller map can be practical. Fast ships
need room to move!


Because the centre-to-centre distance between two
spaces at this scale is only a little farther than the
limit of Short range (1,296 kilometres instead of 1,250
kilometres), at the Referee’s discretion it can be helpful
for gameplay purposes to rule that the maximum limit of
Short range is two spaces distance instead of only one.


Whether using a VTT or physical map, it can be helpful
to add a table on the side of your map with the above
range table, or to create a cheat sheet to make it easy
to see the range limits at a glance. For a physical
map, the distances can be translated into inches or
centimetres according to the square/hex scale of the
map, such that ranges can be determined with tape
measures (measure centre-to-centre of each space,
with the Referee settling any disputes).


173

###### Vector-Based Space Combat


TRAVELLER


Each ship should receive its own token, counter, or
miniature on the map. For a VTT, online tools such as
Token Stamp 2 can be used to create virtual tokens
with ship names or art, which can be imported into
the VTT. For a physical map, miniatures, counters or
cardboard cut-outs sized to fit the map can be used. In
either case, each token should be easily identifiable,
including the name of the ship and its current vectors.
Remember that in this system, facing does not
have a mechanical effect but turning the token to its
approximate direction of movement can be a useful
visual aid. For a physical map, a small sticky note
next to each token can be used to record the ship’s
name and vector, ideally in pencil since the vectors
will change from round to round. VTTs usually allow
tokens to be named, and some include visual counters
for gameplay elements such as ‘Armour Class’ and
‘Hit Points’ that could be used to record the current
speeds in the X and Y directions. It can also be useful
to see at a glance what a ship’s maximum Thrust is (for
ships with Reaction drives, a good practice is to record
maximum Thrust as M+R, where M is the maximum
manoeuvre drive Thrust, and R is the maximum
reaction drive Thrust – thus, a ship with an M-drive 5
and R-drive 3 would be denoted as (5+3). If using a
VTT that does not provide visual token counters, modify
the name of the VTT token with its current vectors, for
example, ‘Beowulf (3, -2)’.


When multiple ships of the same type are moving
together, a single token can be used to track the group

- either use the name to denote the number of craft (for
example, ‘Light Fighters x5’ or note the number on the
sticky note being used to track their movement vectors.


OBJECTS IN SPACE
Planets, asteroids, derelict ships, space stations and
so on may also be represented as tokens. Be sure to
scale objects appropriately – a large planet may be
several spaces wide! It is generally simplest to treat
these objects as stationary on the map, even for
space stations that have a maximum Thrust of 0.1G
but in some cases the Referee may choose to give
them a speed.


ROUND SEQUENCE
ACCELERATION PHASE
After the Initiative phase but before the Movement
phase, a new Acceleration phase is added. In this
phase, each ship in reverse initiative order determines
how much Thrust they will apply to movement this
round, adds that to their current recorded vectors and
records their new vector values. Using reverse initiative
order in this phase allows higher-initiative ships to react
to the anticipated movement of ‘slower’ ships. Just as
in the space combat rules, any Thrust intended to be
used for evasive action or helping gunners cannot be
applied as movement Thrust during this phase. Do not
move ships or missiles on the map during this phase.
That occurs during the Movement phase.


For example, a ship with recorded vectors of (-12,
7) and a maximum Thrust 6 applies Thrust 4 in
the positive-X direction (slowing its speed along
the X axis) and Thrust 2 in the positive-Y direction
(increasing its speed along that axis). Its resulting
speed vectors will therefore become (-8, 9), so the
Traveller records that as their new speed.

174

###### Vector-Based Space Combat


It can be helpful for Travellers to use temporary tokens
to visualise where their ships would move if they do not
apply any Thrust at all this round – this can help them
determine how much Thrust they want to apply this
round, and in which direction. A simple coin could be
used on a physical map, leaving the ship’s miniature
or counter in place and counting out the movement
to place the coin in the space where the ship will end
up this round if it simply coasts along; a supply of
temporary tokens can be useful to have at the edge of
a VTT map for this purpose as well.

If missiles are in flight, then after all ships have
applied Thrust, add the missiles’ maximum Thrust (10
or 15, per the Traveller Core Rulebook or High Guard)
to their current speed (see ‘Missiles in Vector-Based
Combat’).

Once all ships and missiles have applied Thrust
and recorded their new vectors, proceed to the
Movement phase.

**MOVEMENT PHASE**
Because all movement is treated as simultaneous,
and all vectors for this round were recorded in the
Acceleration phase, ships and missiles can be moved
in any order. Spacecraft move a number of spaces
according to their vectors. For example, a ship with
X and Y vectors of (3, -5) moves three spaces in the
positive-X direction, and five spaces in the negative-Y
direction. It does not matter if you execute the X or Y
portion of the ship’s movement first, as it will end up in
the same space either way.


MISSILES IN VECTOR-BASED SPACE COMBAT
Missile-firing ships can potentially fire multiple salvoes
of missiles at different targets, round after round.
When using vector-based space combat rules, ignore
the Missile Flight table in the Traveller Core Rulebook,
and use these rules instead.


Missiles can take several rounds to arrive at their
targets and if several ships are all firing missiles,
that might result in many additional and necessary
tokens on the map. Tracking and plotting vectors for
all these missiles could slow the game to a crawl, so
instead of tracking vectors for each salvo of missiles,
only its speed is tracked, increasing each round
according to its Thrust, and the firing ship simply
moves the missiles that far in the direction of its
target during the Movement phase.


Create a new token for each new salvo. The token
name or associated sticky note should include:

- The name of the firing ship and the salvo’s target
- The number of missiles in the salvo
- If using non-Standard missiles from High Guard,
    the type of missiles in the salvo
- The current speed derived from the firing ship
    (missiles start with their firing ship’s vector)
- The number of rounds of Thrust left for the missile
    to find its target (starts at 10)


175

###### Vector-Based Space Combat


TRAVELLER


The easiest way to determine the starting speed of
missiles is to place a token on the space where the
firing ship would end up if it does not expend any
Thrust next round and measure the distance in spaces
from the firing ship to that space, rounding to the
nearest whole number. For example, on a square map,
if the firing ship has vectors of (2, -2), the range on
a VTT map if using the recommended measurement
method would be three squares, so the speed would be

3. Measuring the same distance on a physical map with
a scale of one inch per square would show 2.8 inches,
rounded up to 3. Thus, the starting speed of these
missiles would be 3. Similar methods could be used on
a hex map, or if using a different measurement system.


Once the token is created and the firing ship, target,
number of missiles, missile type and starting speed
are recorded, it is placed on the same space as the
firing ship (if this is not convenient, place the token
in the space adjacent to that of the firing ship). The
missiles do not accelerate or move any further on the
round in which they are fired. In the Acceleration phase
of the following round, the missiles’ maximum Thrust
is added to their current speed and the number of
rounds of remaining Thrust is decreased by one. In the
Movement phase, the firing ship moves the missiles
up to that many spaces towards their target. If the
missiles reach their target, place them on the same
space as the target (or adjacent to the target, if that is
more convenient). Missile detection, countermeasures
and missile impacts are handled as stated in the Space
Combat chapter of the Traveller Core Rulebook.


As missiles are destroyed via electronic warfare or
point defence fire, decrease the number of missiles
on the token, and remove the token if and when
the last missile is destroyed. Damage from missiles
that reach their target is handled per the Space
Combat rules, as normal.


LARGER-SCALE MAPS
Often, adversaries in space combat may start from a
great distance apart (for example, from 100 diameters,
or even from the distance to a gas giant) and it would
be very impractical to attempt to run a combat scenario
on a map thousands of spaces across. Even so, the
Referee might want to track the approach of opposing
ships or fleets from great distances for immersion and
dramatic effect. Fortunately, the math is such that it is
easy to create maps of greater scale: for each multiple
of 10 in the width of each space, increasing the duration
of each round by a multiple of four maintains the Thrust
1 = 1 space scale. For example, if the size of each
space on the map is increased from 648 kilometres to
6,480 kilometres and the rounds are increased from six
minutes in length to 24, acceleration and movement
can be treated exactly as it is during normal space
combat rounds using the vector rules above. Of course,
at any scale beyond 648 kilometres per space, range
will be Distant and combat will be impossible until the
adversaries have moved closer to each other.


The following table provides suggested map scales for
various common starting ranges.


While there may be situations when it makes sense to
increase the scale of your map, it is more likely to be
useful when opposing sides start at a great distance,
move towards each other using a higher-scale map,
and then ‘zoom in’ as the ships get closer, until they
are on a x1 scale map using standard six-minute space
combat rounds. Either way, the process is similar.


When moving from larger-scale to the next smaller
scale, increase the distance between ships in spaces
by a factor of 10 and multiply all vectors by 2.5
(rounding up). When moving from a smaller-scale map
to the next larger scale, divide the distances between
ships by a factor of 10, and divide each vector by 2.5,
rounding to the nearest whole number.


Movement Scales
Scale Space Width Round Length Suggested use
x1 648km 6 minutes World Surface to Orbit
x10 6,480km 24 minutes Orbiting Satellite or 100 diameters from mainworld for smaller
worlds, or larger worlds when ships have low Thrust
x100 64,800km 96 minutes 100 diameters from mainworlds for larger worlds, especially
for fast-moving ships

176

###### Vector-Based Space Combat


For example: two ships on a x10 scale map have been
accelerating towards each other for several rounds.
They have reached a range of 9 spaces (58.320
kilometres at this scale); one ship has a vector of (+15,
0) and the other has a vector of (-12, 0). Moving them
to a x1 scale map would put them at a distance of
90 spaces. The first ship’s vector would be rounded
up to (38, 0) and the second ship’s vector becomes
(-30, 0). This same process would be used if moving
from a x1,000 scale map to a x100 scale map. At any
map scale beyond x1, the Initiative, Acceleration and
Movement phases would happen as defined in the
above rules but combat actions will not occur until the
scale has been reduced to x1.

DOGFIGHTING IN VECTOR-BASED

SPACE COMBAT

Because the scale of even the 1x scale map is still
quite large at 648 kilometres per space, and ships
may be travelling at vastly different speeds even
when they cross paths, additional conditions are
needed to allow ships to dogfight.

Both ships must end their movement for a round in the
same space, with the same vectors. The ship with the
higher initiative will be better able to match positions
and speeds in order to achieve this, but Improve
Initiative rolls by the ship’s captain can potentially make
up the difference if it is close.

At that point, if both ships’ wish to dogfight, then
proceed to the Dogfighting rules presented in the
Traveller Core Rulebook. If neither wishes to dogfight,
then treat the ships as being at Short range.

If only one of the ships wishes to keep out of
dogfighting range, have the ships’ pilots do an opposed
Pilot (Dexterity) check, allowing any unused Thrust to
be used in this step as a +DM on a one-for-one basis.
If the pursuing pilot fails the opposed check, treat the
ships as being in Short range.

As described in the Traveller Core Rulebook, resolve the
dogfight fully before returning to space combat rounds.


SHIPS THAT PASS IN THE NIGHT
In most cases, firing range should be determined
based on the final positions of ships in a combat
round, that is, after all ships have performed their
movement for the round, and attacks and damage
resolution happen in the Attack step, in initiative order.
However, in some cases, it might happen that two
fast-moving ships could approach each other and
pass by at a relatively short range during the middle
of their movement. In such cases, it makes sense to
allow firing to happen at the closer range, and for the
ships to decide when to shoot, which could override
the initiative order – they must determine whether it is
better to wait until the last possible moment in order to
fire at the shortest possible range, or to fire first at a
longer distance and risk missing.


When two ships look like they will pass by each other
in a given combat round, the Referee may choose to
resolve their movement together in order to provide
an opportunity for the ships to take advantage of
potentially shorter range. A good way to approximate
this is to drop a temporary token at the final space
the ships will move to this round and then move the
ships roughly along their respective paths until they
reach the closest point. At any time, each ship can
declare it wishes to fire.


At that point, leave the ships where they are on the
map, and proceed to the Attack Step phase of the
combat round; resolve these attacks at the initiative of
the ship that decided to fire, even if this means skipping
the initiative of the ship who hesitated. Once the firing
ship has resolved its attacks and any damage done,
the Referee should continue the movement of the
passing ships, which might allow the hesitant ship to
fire at an even closer range, should they survive the
other vessel’s attacks.


If the Referee judges that the passing ships’ paths
cross in the same map space at the same time, they
may allow a single six-second round of Dogfighting
as they pass each other. Use an opposed Pilot check
described in the Dogfighting section above if one of the
ships wants to avoid the dogfight.

# S TARSHIP AUTOMATION

Increased automation reduces crew requirements,
although a smaller crew is not always desirable. Ships
with few personnel aboard cannot react as well to a
crisis or damage; the loss of a single crewmember can
be crippling to a very tightly crewed vessel. However,
automation is useful under many circumstances.

Virtually all ships have some degree of automation,
from autoloaders on missile systems to automated
monitoring systems for the power plant. These are
standard labour-saving devices and without them crew
requirements increase dramatically. A heavily automated
vessel makes greater use of such devices and ties them
into an integrated crew-assistance system.

The cost of automating a vessel is based on the total
cost of its hull, plus drives and power plant, as shown
on the Ship Automation table.

Crew requirements are based on a percentage
reduction of the normal number of personnel required.
This tends to affect engineering and operations
personnel more than flight crew, since there are many
jobs that cannot be shared. For example, a vessel that
has four small craft aboard needs a pilot for each of
them if they are to be used at the same time. It is not
possible for one crewmember to somehow be piloting
the main vessel and two of its craft at once unless they
are fully autonomous robotic devices. By the same
token, a ship that needs one astrogator but has a 40%
crew requirement reduction still needs an astrogator.


Instead of reducing the number of personnel aboard,
automation can be used to make their lives easier
and more comfortable. This is not usually done except
aboard long-range ships, where crew are likely to be
aboard for extended periods and luxury vessels.


Crew-intensive vessels have virtually no automation;
everything is done by hand. This is the case aboard
some very primitive ships but is inefficient to say the
least. Low automation is cheap but again is inefficient
unless the crew work hard, in which case fatigue begins
to set in after a week in space. DMs for shipboard tasks
are applied to all checks – engineering, astrogation,
landing; even making lunch in the galley is a trial
aboard a ship without a powered can-opener.

**Ship Automation**


Automation Cost Crew Requirement Effect
Crew-intensive -40% +100% DM-4 on all shipboard tasks.
Low Automation -20% +40% DM-1 on all shipboard tasks after 1 week in space
Standard Automation Normal Normal None
Enhanced Automation +25% -10% None
Advanced Automation +50% -25% DM+1 on all shipboard tasks
High Automation +100% -40% DM+2 on all shipboard tasks


# G RAVITIC SHIELDING

Gravitic Shielding becomes available – in a primitive
form – at TL16. Initially, it is useful only as a rather
crude defensive system but more advanced and
controllable systems have other uses.

Gravitic shielding creates a region of twisting
gravitational forces close to the ship’s hull. This
has no effect on energy weapons but may rip apart
a small craft or missile closing with the shielded
vessel or deflect a kinetic weapon. It is theorised
that sufficiently powerful gravitic shielding might be
able to deflect particle weapons and even lasers, but
the technology to achieve this is unimaginably far in
advance of any known civilisation.

If the shielded vessel is struck by a missile, torpedo
or small projectiles (i.e. rail-gun bullets) there is a
chance that the hit is negated by the shield – bullets
are scattered or deflected before impact, while
missiles are destroyed or flung away from the ship.


The field cannot affect lasers sufficiently to cause a
miss at the ranges over which the field is projected
but more advanced versions will stop plasma or fusion
weaponry. An active gravitic shield will also damage
small craft and vessels nearby – any craft at Close
range suffers damage each round.


These shields also provide protection from high
gravity fields such as those encountered near
a Black Hole. Gravity fields of less than the G
Tolerance value on the Gravitic Shield table will not
affect a ship with an active shield.


A shielded vessel may still fire its own beam weapons
but missiles and small craft cannot be launched or
recovered with the shield in operation. The shield can
be turned off at any time for an entire round.
Gravitic shielding consumes 1 Power and 0.5 tons per
5 tons of the ship’s hull. The cost listed in the Gravitic
Shield table is per ton of the shielding system itself.

# S TARSHIP WEAPONRY

Some of the weapons in this chapter are likely only to
be encountered in relic or prototype form, although they
may be in use by some advanced civilisations. Others
are simpler and might be encountered in the hands
of anyone from pirates to naval vessels. Not all need
be mounted on ships and may be present as part of a
planetary defence network.

**ANTIMATTER STREAMER**
An antimatter streamer is a crude particle beam
weapon which fires a stream of heavy antimatter
particles. This causes severe explosive effects on the
target, although the beam dissipates (spectacularly)
over short distances. An antimatter streamer is
a bay-sized weapon, with a maximum range of
Medium. Damage is attenuated at this distance;
each dice of damage is treated as D3 at Medium
range. Closer targets take full damage. Conversely,
the dissipating spray of antimatter increases the
likelihood of a successful hit at longer rangers; the
streamer gains DM+2 to attack rolls at Short range
and DM+4 at Medium range.

**PLASMA/FUSION CARRONADE**
A carronade is a short-ranged plasma weapon firing
a stream (more accurately a spray, since the stream
tends to spread out quickly) of superheated gas.
The weapon is named for an archaic short-barrelled
cannon also referred to as a ‘smasher’. Carronades
are primarily used aboard fast ships intended to close
to very short range and deliver a powerful strike. They
are most effective against lightly armoured vessels, as
the main drawback of carronade weapons is their poor
performance against armour.

Other than close-in firepower, carronades also have
the advantage of being relatively cheap. A carronade
consumes four hardpoints on a ship’s hull and cannot
be fitted to vessels with less than four. More advanced
ships can make use of fusion carronades, which are
similar but use more energetic plasma.


HULLCUTTER
A hullcutter is a large and powerful weapon firing a
beam of exotic particles designed to simply cut enemy
ships into pieces. It is possible that this weapon is a
precursor of the disintegrator beam, which can cause
an entire ship to dissolve into its constituent atoms.
Early hullcutters require a large bay but on extremely
advanced ships they can be fitted into smaller mounts.


DISINTEGRATOR
Shipboard disintegrator weapons are a very rare spinal
mount and typically associated with the Ancients
or other old, powerful civilisations. Their stream of
energised exotic particles cause a reaction in the atoms
and molecules of the target. As atomic bonds fail, the
ship’s matter begins to drift apart in fragments varying
in size from a turret or bridge down to single atoms. In
some cases, atoms recombine and release small high-
energy explosions. Maximum range for disintegrator
weapons varies according to their Tech Level.


GROUND DEFENCE GUNS
Whilst missiles are the standard mid-tech weapons
for defence against spacecraft, supplemented or
supplanted by energy weapons at higher Tech
Levels, some cultures prefer conventional or
hypervelocity guns. These can endanger a ship
stationary in orbit and guns can certainly make a
landing site very unhealthy. Standard artillery can
be used to bombard a landing site to deny it to the
enemy or inflict damage but much higher-velocity
weapons are needed to hit a moving ship.


The earliest effective ground defence guns appear at
TL4. These are essentially a larger version of anti-
aircraft guns, firing an explosive shell at relatively high
velocity. Early guns of this sort can only fire on targets
approaching their defended area; they cannot attack
orbital targets. Ground defence weapons are usually
mounted in fixed fortifications but can be carried aboard
maritime ships or extremely large vehicles.

At TL6, very high velocity guns firing discarding
sabot penetrator rounds can engage targets in low
orbit, although the time required to reach the target
imposes DM-4 to attack rolls against any orbital
target that can manoeuvre under power – this is
in addition to any evasion the target may attempt.
The usual tactic is to use several guns to fire a box
barrage around the target’s projected location using
fragmentation shells in the hope of doing at least
some damage. A direct hit with a penetrator round
will do far more harm but is unlikely to hit at all.


At TL7, hypervelocity guns are available which can
engage a target in high orbit with at least some chance
of a hit. High orbital targets are subject to DM-4 to
attack rolls in addition to any evasion performed,
providing the target can manoeuvre. Targets in low orbit
are subject to DM-2 if they can manoeuvre.


Fragmentation ammunition does half as much damage
as a standard penetrator round but gains DM+2 to
attack rolls which may offset some targeting difficulties.


GENERAL-PURPOSE MASS DRIVER
A large but fairly low-powered mass driver, this is not
a weapon as such but can be pressed into service
for bombardment purposes. It is not very useful as
a ship-to-ship weapon, suffering DM-4 to attack rolls
against any target that can manoeuvre, in addition
to any evasion attempts. Launchers of this sort are
often carried aboard mining ships to deliver ore to
a remote destination and the same system can be
used to bombard a planet with asteroidal debris or
even the compacted debris of an orbital defence
squadron. Launchers are also used to deploy mines
and satellites, saving their own drive systems for
necessary manoeuvres. A general-purpose mass
driver requires a small bay for its mountings and can
launch a mass equal to its own. If additional capacity
is required, two tons aboard the ship are required
per ton of additional launch capacity, at a cost of
Cr75000 and 3 Power per ton.


WEAPON TRAITS
Several new weapon traits are introduced here
for starship weaponry.


Chain Reaction: This weapon continues to
deal damage over time as its effects dissipate
slowly. A target hit by a Chain Reaction weapon
takes normal damage the first round then half
as much the following round (rounding down),
halving again each round thereafter until damage
reaches zero. If another Chain Reaction hit
is received during this time, only the highest
damage is applied (so only one Chain Reaction
effect is taking place at any one time).


Reductor: This weapon ruins armour as it
attacks a ship. The Armour score of a ship
hit by a Reductor weapon is reduced by -1
for every dice rolled for damage. Damage is
applied after this reduction.


Weak: This weapon can devastate an
unprotected target but its lethality quickly
drops off when met with armour. The Armour
score of the target is doubled against the
damage this weapon deals.


TORPEDO-INTERCEPTOR CLUSTER
Torpedo-interceptors are shipped as clusters of
four; a cluster fits on a hardpoint instead of a turret
or other mount. Designed to be launched at the last
instant before a missile or torpedo impacts the vessel,
interceptors are sometimes carried by vessels with
no other missile capability and require no additional
electronics. Interceptor clusters are one-shot systems
which must be removed and replaced – a dockside
job – after firing. Torpedo interceptors can be used only
against incoming missiles or torpedoes. Any or all of the
interceptors in a cluster can be fired at once; each kills
one missile on 6+ on a 2D roll and a torpedo on 8+.

The Traveller Companion is a compilation of variant and alternate rules. Variant Traveller
creation systems allow specific tailoring, whilst alternate combat rules introduce hit
locations and wound severity. Rules for hunger, thirst, temperature, atmospheric and
water pressure effects make the universe more realistic, not to mention more hazardous.
Encounters with animals and vehicles are also covered, along with the consequences of
lawbreaking on personal and starship-operations scales.


The game universe is expanded with advice on using tools such as Travellermap
and the Traveller Wiki, interpreting UWP data to flesh out a world, and additional
spaceport types. The Companion also contains rules for starship operations in gas
giant atmospheres, travelling slower than light and in jump space, and making space
travel more hazardous with minefields, missile salvoes, and new starship weapons. Also
included are rules for entirely different styles of play such as narrative task resolution
and the mundane events resolution system.


The Traveller Companion is a complete toolkit allowing referees to pick and choose
enhancements to their own campaigns, giving greater depth and weight to their adventures.
