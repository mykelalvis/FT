**Cafad** is an agricultural, nonindustrial, pre-rich garden world with a near-ideal, utopian environment conducive to most sophonts, but still lacks an adequate population to expand its economy to a rich status.

*   As an agricultural world, this world is a near-ideal environment for producing quality foodstuffs of plant, animal, and other forms. Quality foodstuffs are a major export commodity for this world.
*   It requires extensive imports of outside technology to maintain a modern, star-faring society. Having to import most manufactured and high tech goods drives the price up for these items at this world.
*   Its economy and population are rapidly growing and living conditions are expected to quickly rise barring outside forces.
*   It is a member of the Third Imperium in the [[Sashrakusha Subsector]] of [[Corridor Sector]] in the Domain of Vland.
*   It orbits in the outer system.
*   This is a cold world with an overall climate that is at the lower temperature range of human-congruous sophont endurance.
*   This is a "low technology" world with technology competencies well below technology standards for Charted Space.
*   During initial surveys this world was named _Giar Ziip "Giar Ziip (world)")_.
*   It is the homeworld of the Cafadans, a minor human race.
*   It is part of the Lancian Cultural Region, though it is not particularly Lancian in nature.
*   Cafad is located on the Vilani Main. It is specifically part of the Shurgi Main branch.

History & Background (Dossier)

Comp-Prog-Dav-R-Deitrick-Starter-Trav-Page-16 16-July-2018a.jpg

**Cafad** is the homeworld of the Cafadans, or _Cafadi_, a Minor Human Race. They were transplanted to the world by the Ancients sometime after -300,000, inhabiting vast networks of caverns that protected them from the world's extreme temperatures.

Sylean surveys of the world dated at around -100 reported that it was unpopulated: the population had retreated into their ancestral caverns during the Long Night and the surveys failed to detect them.

### World Starport (St)

**Cafad** has a **Class E Starport**, a frontier quality installation with few expected amenities. There is unrefined fuel for starships and a limited variety of ship provisions. There is no shipyard of any kind, but there may be parts and technical support for doing minor services and repair. Ports of this classification generally consist of a downport.

### World Population (P)

**Cafad** has a population of 400,000 sophonts (hundreds of thousands).

*   This is a Nonindustrial World, too small to support the complete chain of production of most goods from start to finish.
*   Almost the entire population consists of Cafadans.

#### World Languages

The following languages are most commonly heard:

*   Anglic, one of the two official languages of the Imperium.
*   Kehuu, the primary Lancian language, as common on the worlds of the Cultural Region as Anglic or Vilani "Vilani (language)").
*   Local Cafadan languages and dialects.
*   Ushi, a language used throughout Gushemege Sector.
*   Vilani "Vilani (language)"), one of the two official languages of the Imperium.
