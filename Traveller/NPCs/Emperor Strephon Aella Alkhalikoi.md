Following the death of his father, Emperor Strephon was crowned the 43rd Emperor of the Third Imperium on 014-1071 at the tender age of 21. As the oldest child of Paulo and Elbet Alkhalikoi, Strephon was groomed for the role since birth. Being prepared to rule the most powerful human empire ever created shortly after reaching adulthood is a tall order for anyone but Strephon managed it surprisingly well, exhibiting grace and aplomb at every turn.

The first great challenge of Strephon’s reign was the [[Fourth Frontier War]]. The war, conducted entirely within the confines of the [[Spinward Marches]], was over in a mere 16 months. The Imperium made modest territorial gains, which Strephon leveraged to portray himself as a capable and victorious war-time leader. The war also marked the beginning of a long friendship between Strephon and  [[Duke Norris]] of [[Regina Subsector|Regina]]. 'The war exposed the vulnerability of the [[Domain of Deneb]]. The Emperor recognizes that the Imperium must be better prepared for inevitable future Frontier Wars. His reputation and standing depends upon it.

The [[Fourth Frontier War]] woke Strephon up to the reality that the Imperium was becoming too broad and unwieldy. Its disparate sectors are too far apart for communication to be practical. In defiance of [[the Moot]], Strephon reestablished the domains and appointed archdukes to most of them to enhance the Imperium’s abilities to respond to crises such as those seen in the [[Domain of Deneb]] whose borders with the [[Zhodani]], [[Vargr]] and the upstart [[Sword Worlds]] were a constant source of trouble.

The [[Chancellor of the Moot]], a strong believer in the efficacy of psychohistory, advised Strephon to take heed of [[Ilelish]], where one revolt was put down centuries earlier and which could very well be the source of renewed unrest. In an attempt to pre-emptively address such problems, the Emperor has recently appointed one of his closest friends, [[Dulinor Astrin Ilethian]], as Archduke of the [[Domain of Ilelish]] in an effort to forestall any problems from the highly developed and industrialised province.

Emperor Strephon travels [[Core Sector|Core]] and its neighboring sectors frequently, mostly on official business. He has also recently become involved in several highly secretive enterprises, which have something to do with the security of [[Capital]] and the [[Imperium]] at large.

When he can, the Emperor likes to get away to the northern seas of [[Capital]], the reserve world of [[Crompton]] or even the stark desolation of [[Onon]], depending on his mood. As he has gotten older, the Emperor has found that the crown weighs upon him more heavily. The Imperium has become a difficult to manage and very complex affair and there are times that he just needs to get away to get his thoughts straight.
