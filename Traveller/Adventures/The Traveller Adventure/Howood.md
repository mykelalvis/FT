[[CT-TTA-Howood.jpg|Howood tree]]

Extremely dense, striated, lignous material obtained from the trunk of the howood tree, a rare plant native to [[Pretoria]] known to grow on [[Pysadi]] and [[Violante]]. The trees concentrate metals from the soil in their extremely tough bark.  It is also beautiful; the size, colors, and intensities of its rings and striations vary unpredictably with the characteristics of the environment in which the plant grows.

In addition, howood is strongly aromatic, and its scent Is pleasing to humans and Vargr.
