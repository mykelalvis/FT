# ASLAN

The Aslan are a race of intelligent beings; their starfaring culture is the youngest of all the Major Races, having had star flight for less than 3,200 years. Despite their youth, their spread through space has been rapid, driven by the instinctive territorial desires that are central to the Aslan male.

![[AoCS1-0027.jpg|200]]

## PHYSIOLOGY

Aslan are descended from four-limbed carnivorous pouncer stock, which was originally near the top of the food chain in the forests of their homeworld, Kusyu. About 1.8 million years ago Kusyu's climate shifted, with the result that the extensive forests of Tafohti (Kusyu's largest continent) almost completely disappeared. As the forests dwindled, so did the small fauna upon which the Aslan had preyed, forcing them to venture out into the expanding grassland plains. The large grazing animals in these regions were too much for a lone Aslan to kill and they began hunting in _ahriy_ (prides) of several families. The strongest male became the leader and his family received the best parts of kills, choice sleeping places and were first in line at any waterhole.

The Aslan that has evolved from those beginnings is, like a human, an upright biped averaging two meters in height and 100 kilograms in mass. There are two sexes: male and female, of which the most notable external difference is the male's increased size and more impressive mane. Females outnumber males by a ratio of three to one.

The Aslan hand has three fingers opposing one medially-placed thumb and all have retractable claws. In addition, Aslan have a single highly specialized claw under each thumb; this dewclaw folds back jack-knife fashion into a horny covering in the base of the thumb and palm. The presence of these claws and the general nature of their body structure make the Aslan somewhat clumsy by comparison with humans but what they lack in dexterity they more than make up for in strength and endurance.

Aslan all have tails, although the length of this appendage has diminished over time and is now little more than a vestigial stump in some bloodlines.

Aslan sleep about one-third of the time; shaped by their homeworld's rotation period, their sleeping time is roughly 10 to 11 hours (one-third of Kusyu's 32-hour day). Like humans, lack of sleep degrades their abilities drastically.

The Aslan gestation period is roughly one _ftahea_ , or 10 months in human terms. Most are single births – twins are virtually unheard of and are almost always female. Male twins are rare enough to be virtually unknown. The young are born encapsulated in tough embryonic cauls, which are then cut away by the mother using a claw (or in modern times, by a surgeon's laser). Cubs mature quickly, learning to walk in only two months.

True to their pouncer ancestry, Aslan are capable of short bursts of speed somewhat greater than that manageable by humans. They also have slightly superior hearing and night vision. Otherwise, they are one of the most human-like of all alien races, excepting, of course, the Vargr (who are, after all, genetically-altered mammalian stock originally from Earth).

Early [[Terra|Terran]] explorers regarded Aslan as 'lion-like' and the simile has stuck ever since, although Aslan bear little resemblance to Terrestrial lions. Nonetheless, this early misnomer has influenced a great deal of human thinking about them, including terminology (the use of pride to translate _ahriy_ , for instance) and ascribed behaviour, which is not at all leonine. The derivation of the word Aslan is unknown but is sometimes credited to human explorers who first contacted the race.

## LIFESPAN

Aslan develop faster than humans and are considered adult at 15 years. A male Aslan is in his prime from the age of 20 to around 40, whereupon he begins to decline rapidly. Males live naturally into their 60s; females reach the mid-50s on average. Gerontology is not a priority for Aslan medical science, so aged Aslan who wish to prolong their lifespan unnaturally must seek out alternative sources of medical treatment.

## DIET

The Aslan are almost exclusively carnivorous. They consume a few nuts, fruits and berries but scorn root vegetables, grains and other plant-based foods as being fit only for 'herd animals'. The Aslan practise extensive agriculture to maintain their vast herds of livestock and there is some archaeological evidence to suggest that early Aslan had a diet higher in vegetable matter but cultural emphasis on predation and carnivorous behaviour means no modern Aslan would willingly eat plants.

The Aslan have the technology to produce synthesised meat but it is consumed only by the poorest members of society or on worlds too scantly populated or inhospitable to support agriculture. Even frozen meat is considered extremely poor fare – in any civilised Aslan house or restaurant, the meat is slaughtered right on the spot and rich Aslan even hunt their own food on a regular basis, stalking prey across private estates. As a single herd animal provides far more meat than even a teenage male could eat, almost all Aslan dinners are communal affairs. A whole family plus guests will dine together. Aslan normally eat one large meal a day and sleep after eating.

Small animals are eaten raw, while larger cuts of meat are lightly cooked and heavily spiced. The Aslan have an astonishing repertoire of spices and chemical preparations both subtle and bold. Aslan try to maintain such culinary practices even on spacecraft, using mouse-sized robots covered in a meaty sheath to mimic live prey and carrying herd animals in cryoberths for later consumption.

Aslan cannot naturally digest [[Terra|Terran]]-derived meats but adding a few genetically-engineered stomach bacteria corrects this. Some Aslan take pills when visiting human worlds to adjust their biochemistry, although many clans now include these bacteria in medical treatments given to all children soon after birth.

## SOCIETY

The Aslan have long been a warrior race; they are noble and proud, devoted to those in authority above them and responsible for those who owe fealty from below. Aslan society is based on family and its relationships.

## FAMILY STRUCTURES

An individual Aslan is usually a member of a family ( ekho ) of 2–12 persons under a patriarchal leader. This family will generally include the male family head, one or more wives, plus children and various blood relatives of the leader (unmarried brothers and sisters, aged surviving parents no longer maintaining separate families, adopted orphans of blood relatives).

The Aslan do not distinguish between mothers – all cubs sired by a male are cared for equally by all the male's wives. Patrilinear descent is all that is important in Aslan society. Cubs are more capable than human infants and grow more quickly. A cub can walk by the age of three months and can speak within five or six months.

A child is considered part of the father's family until:

- She is married off to a male (if female)
- He acquires Territory (if male)
- The father dies

In the latter case, the father's Territory passes to the eldest son. The eldest son may choose to include his siblings in his family but is under no formal obligation to do so.

Several families combine into a pride ( _ahriy_ ), with one family dominant. The leader of that family is also the leader of the pride. Other families owe him and his family their fealty. A number of prides form a clan (huiha), with one pride dominant. Again, prides in the clan owe fealty to the clan's leader. The clan's leader is expected, in turn, to protect and provide for members of the clan settling disputes between prides within the clan, and administering his holdings wisely and well.

Clans may, in turn, owe fealty to more powerful clans, particularly where blood relationships exist. The Tlaukhu consists of the Twenty-Nine pre-eminent Aslan clans, the strongest within the Hierate; many other clans owe them fealty, either directly or through a chain of other clans. Overall, however, clans owing fealty to one of the Tlaukhu are in the minority; most clans are independent and function accordingly.

## BELIEFS

Aslan are spiritual without being especially religious; they honor their ancestors and ask for their blessings but do not worship them per se. Every Aslan home has a Shrine of Heroes, containing relics of important ancestors; most Aslan will also carry a pouch containing other keepsakes or some other heirloom. Honorable behaviour comes from obeying the traditions of the ancestors.

The Aslan do not recognize any supreme being or divine plan but believe the universe is alive in some fashion. Perfect actions – actions unfettered by doubt, by fear, by irrelevant worries or concerns – can bring an Aslan into accord with the universe for an instant. Such moments are called _aokol_.

## DUELLING AND HONOUR

Aslan pride makes them a touchy race and it is quite easy for Aslan to give or take offence. This behaviour originated in the struggles for dominance within families and prides, and remains a basic part of the Aslan personality. Over the centuries, Aslan touchiness has grown formal and extremely ritualised; this rigid pattern of behaviour has been necessary to reduce conflict and injury in the settlement of personal disputes. It should be noted that this struggle for dominance is so deeply embedded into the Aslan psyche that it cannot be unlearned. An Aslan can no more ignore an infringement on his Territory or challenge to his authority than a human could ignore the urge to breathe.

Non-Aslan who do not understand these ritual forms of conduct find it difficult to get along with individual Aslan. For their part, most sophisticated Aslan have learned a certain amount of tolerance towards those who do not fit into the Aslan cultural pattern but the cultural patterns are deeply ingrained and offence is still taken from time-to-time.

Aslan society generally categorises abrasive, uncultured or offensive behaviour into three classes; familiarity, impoliteness and discourtesy.

Familiarity is the treatment of social superiors as equals; it involves social interaction, extreme friendliness or condescending treatment by a lower class Aslan toward an upper-class Aslan. Touching an Aslan without permission is an instance of familiarity.

Impoliteness stems from a lack of proper education or upbringing; it might include failure to address a social superior by the correct honorifics, failure to respond promptly when addressed or losing one's temper in public.

Discourtesy is a deliberate insult and springs from contempt, a lack of respect or malice; outward actions may often be perceived by Aslan as discourtesy although not meant to be so by someone alien to Aslan culture.

Failing to immediately apologise for familiarity is impolite; failing to apologise for impoliteness when corrected is discourteous. An Aslan may apologise verbally or by making signs of submission (offering one's throat to the offended party or abasing oneself). Without an apology, any of these three behaviours can give offence and an offended Aslan becomes an enemy.

Discourtesy, however, is grounds for duelling. Duelling is a common way by which insults and slights are resolved, especially if rituals and other tension-relieving forms fail to defuse the problem. Duels follow well-established rituals and are fought to the death only rarely. The rules of conduct and protocols that govern them clearly state what is allowed and not allowed. A challenge to duel is never made lightly. At the same time, reluctance to challenge is seen in Aslan culture as weakness, a trait few Aslan wish to exhibit. Most challenges are issued in response to discourtesy; elaborate but informal rituals have evolved wherein one party is discourteous and actually gains stature if the other does not reply with a challenge. Much of this behaviour seems incomprehensible to individuals not steeped in Aslan culture.

The rituals for duelling, however, are strictly segregated by gender. Males and females never duel; insults and slights by the opposite sex are dismissed with the excuse that males (or females) do not understand female (or male) honor. When a transgression becomes too blatant, too extreme or too unacceptable, then a member of the insulted Aslan's immediate family (and of the correct sex) will respond to the discourtesy with a challenge.

The barriers against certain duels within a family are almost as strong as those for cross-gender duelling. Children never duel with their parents (which socially includes any adults in their family of the previous generation, not just their biological parents).

To issue an informal challenge, the offended party need only bare his or her claws and roar a challenge to the other Aslan. Informal challenges are resolved as quickly as possible and often fought on the spot. Formal challenges are more involved and reserved only for the most important disputes, such as legal arguments. To make a formal challenge, the offended party must contact the clan head or a sanctioned representative of the clan head. The clan head will then decide whether or not to permit the duel and state the time and place of the contest, which will usually be in a clan duelling arena.

Duels between Aslan take place as personal combat. Combatants use only their hands (and dewclaws); combat continues until one side receives a wound. In the case of grave insult, the fight may continue to unconsciousness for one participant. The winner has his or her honor satisfied; the loser is required by social and ritual standards to apologise (even if he or she was the one originally insulted). Duels to the death are not unheard of but are sanctioned only in the rarest of cases. Armor other than light armor is banned, as are combat drugs and other temporary augmentations.

Those too sick or old to duel may appoint a champion in their place but this is extremely rare. Traditionally, there is a clan champion whose responsibility it is to fight for those clan members who cannot duel but in a pinch, any Aslan of the correct gender can be nominated as champion.

For non-Aslan, one way to gain an Aslan's respect is to be willing to challenge when required and to duel if challenged. Aslan consider those who do not embrace their culture to be tahiwihteakhtau (barbarians). Willingness to behave in the honorable fashion is an indication that one is not a completely ignorant barbarian.

Since Aslan respect prowess in battle, upholding one's honor in a duel is especially respected. However, if both parties agree, the duel can be replaced by a contest of a different kind, such as a debate, board game or even the roll of a dice. Such substitution is frowned upon in most circles, as it is seen as degenerate and weak but is common in places like the scientific community, where females will debate the validity of different theories with logic and mathematics, not claws.

In space, Aslan fighter pilots have been known to duel. Such fighter duels have even decided the outcome of whole fleet engagements, where both sides agree to abide by the results of the duel instead of fighting. Fighter duels are fought to the first successful hit.

A duel ends when the loser is wounded (or slain, in the case of duels to the death). The victor may not deliberately slay the loser but (if male) is within his rights to scalp the loser. Duels can also be fought challenging one party's right to breed (this is normally done in response to one Aslan male having sex with the wife of another), in which case the victor may geld the loser.

### Duels and SOC

Most duels are over trivial matters and do not affect the Aslan's SOC. However, formal or especially notable duels can make or break the reputation of an Aslan. A Traveller who wins a formal duel against another Aslan of equal or higher SOC gains DM+1 to any SOC-based check with Aslan; a Traveller who loses a formal duel suffers DM-2.

### Honor

Honor among the Aslan is primarily a male concern. Females are expected to be honorable but it is the males who are obsessed with their honor (or, to quote the poet Tarelriylr, only males have the _greatness of soul_ to be truly honorable).

The Aslan concept of honor rests on three pillars. The simplest form of honor is respect, specifically, respect for the territory of another. An honorable Aslan does not trespass on the territory of another without permission or without intent to conquer. Territory, in this case, covers all the possessions of another person – land, money, wives, everything. An Aslan does not walk on the land owned by another unless the other Aslan allows him access or unless he intends to take it openly from the other Aslan. Conquest is honorable; theft is not. Aslan do not work in secret (even Wars of Assassins should first be declared openly).

From this concept of respect for territory, the Aslan have built a whole system of feudal honor. Lords respect the territory of their vassals, vassals respect the territory of their lords. A good Aslan respects the privacy of another and does not gossip, as this is a form of social trespass, leading to strange situations where an Aslan might studiously ignore the questionable actions of a neighbor for years, never mentioning it to another soul, and then violently intervene without warning. An honorable Aslan takes everything he can hold and keep but does not overreach himself, nor does he fail to live up to his potential. An honorable Aslan, therefore, is boastful to human ears – his boasts show the limits of his strength and ambition, and show his neighbors how far they can push him.

Respect even informs how the Aslan conduct their wars. An Aslan 'respects' his neighbor's territory by taking as much of it as he can in times of war. Whatever the neighbor manages to hold onto, however, is sacrosanct. An honorable man holds everything he can and not a square inch more or less. Only males can hold territory; all others are worthy of respect only when they are associated with a territory-holding male. During the Border Wars, this tenet of Aslan honor confused many humans – an Aslan warrior might bomb a human city indiscriminately, then tend to the victims with great care. What had changed was that now the city was conquered by the Aslan, the humans were now chattels of a land-owning male. The Aslan warrior now respected the humans, as part of his respect for the conquering lord.

The second pillar of honor is tradition. The ways of ancestors and heroes are the correct ways for an Aslan to behave. This does not mean Aslan are slaves to the old ways – new technologies make life easier and better, and Aslan must adapt to new worlds – but it does mean any new developments must be viewed through the eyes of tradition. The teachings of the priests and poets must be obeyed, especially those relating to war and duelling.

An honorable Aslan keeps to the traditions of his sire and his sire's sires. He fights their feuds and helps their allies. He fights duels fairly and makes war according to the limitations agreed on by both sides in the presence of an earleatrais. He keeps his word when he gives it and obeys the commands of his clan elders.

The third and final pillar of honor is harmony of action , or khoafteirleao. This is the hardest of the pillars to master and difficult to even explain to non-Aslan. Of human beliefs, perhaps zen comes closest. The Aslan believe the universe is a thought in motion and that perfect actions can move in accord with that thought. An Aslan who attained khoafteirleao is expressing the will of the universe. Khoafteirleao can be reached in any context or deed but is most commonly found in combat, poetry or speech.

Feuds Disputes between families or prides usually take place because of slights, insults, mistreatments or problems that have not been resolved to both parties' satisfaction. The families may back different scientific theories; one family member may have won a competition which the other family had traditionally won; a family may have rejected a proposed marriage between it and the other family.

Feuds are an intermediate step between duels and wars. Strangely for Aslan society, they are unstructured and lack rituals to control them. If kept at a low level, a feud is a pretext for discourteous behaviour and sparks many duels. If allowed to get out of hand, it involves the vassal prides and families of each side and can erupt into war.

### Reaction Table Results

Hostile reactions usually lead to 'discourtesy' rather than violence. In such an instance, the response given by that reaction would be one that normally would provoke hostility in return. Treat discourtesy as grounds for a formal challenge (but Travellers need not issue such a challenge – although this would take an enormous amount of restraint on the part of Aslan Travellers).

An Aslan who receives discourteous treatment may easily be provoked into an attack. Such an attack may be immediate (which is a violation of ritual and protocol) or may take the form of a challenge to a duel, with the time and place specified. Duels are not (usually) lethal; they are fought to first blood only. The embarrassment and loss of honor one suffers in declining a challenge or refusing a duel is far worse. In addition, for humans, the respect gained by engaging in a duel to defend one's honor can be beneficial in a struggle to fit into Aslan society.

## CREATING ASLAN WORLDS

### The Military

Each clan maintains its own armed forces to defend and protect it and many companies own mercenary forces, which are hired out to clans–or to groups outside the Hierate–for profit. The necessity for such forces is demonstrated by the fact that clan warfare is constant in the Hierate; somewhere there is always a clan war in progress. Although such wars are formal and governed by elaborate rituals, they are no less deadly for the combatants.

External threats to the Aslan are infrequent (the last of the great Aslan Border Wars ended in 380 Imperial) and also are handled on the clan level.

One problem Aslan sometimes have is recognizing that non-Aslan are less likely to fight by the strict set of rules that govern Aslan-Aslan conflicts. Until realised, Aslan often fight at a disadvantage. When they do recognize the enemy is not abiding by the supposed rules, Aslan tend to over-react and begin all-out warfare.

### Organization

Military organization for the Aslan military places males in leadership and fighting positions, and females provide administrative or technical support. Unit commanders are male, assisted by a female executive. The commander leads the troops and determines tactics, while the executive oversees logistics and has a strong influence over operations through her creation of battle plans. Maintenance and supply units are staffed by lower-class males and females. Fighting units are staffed mostly by males, support units mostly by females, although there is some crossover. Males of low social level in combat units have some chance of social (and hence military) advancement, while those in non-combatant arms have virtually none.

### Mercenaries

Mercenary units are typically organised as business ventures by a female (often as part of a corporation). The owner, or a female relation appointed to act as representative of the owner, negotiates tickets and generally sees to business. This individual accompanies the unit headquarters and is the ultimate source of decisions regarding the employment of the unit. In practice, however, she lets the (male) commander make the combat decisions, intervening only when the male's lack of a balanced viewpoint threatens the best business interests of the unit.

The profession of mercenary is an honorable one, since there are usually more landless males (lower-class and ihatei alike) than there are positions in a clan's military force. Mercenaries win land, honor and glory through their actions and females have run mercenary units as a source of wealth since long before the Aslan went into space.

Some mercenary units are composed of highly trained assassins; skilled less in mass warfare than in individual or small unit combat techniques. These units need fewer females, since logistics and similar operations are less a part of a war of assassins. There is nothing dishonorable about such assassinations, as long as they are part of a prescribed clan war. Such units might be comparable to the ninja of Japan but without the stigma attached to ninja by contemporaneous samurai society. All in all, however, assassins and wars of assassins are far less frequent than more orthodox warfare and military forces.

Language and Naming All Aslan (with the exception of a few lost colonies) share a common language and culture. However, this culture is highly complex and custom-bound, and individual names and words can become rather unwieldy.

The clan head of an independent clan (vassal to no other clan) is known simply by the clan's name; where differentiation is necessary, the particle ko (himself) is added. For example, the head of clan Hlyueawi would be known as Hlyueawi or Hlyueawiko. At the opposite extreme, an Aslan lower in the social order (but still a noble) might be named HlyueawifiyAhroay' ifiyWahtoiLayeauiwahfeaktelihlalikhtyeiteyahahtateisiyu , roughly meaning, 'unmarried first son of the third son of the grandfather of the head of the pride which holds the valley in the fork of the Iwahfeal River, part of clan Wahtoi , which is a vassal of clan Aroaye'i , itself a vassal of clan Hlyueawi .'

Females are named for their husbands, fathers or brothers, depending on circumstances. Non-nobles are named for the nobles of whom they are vassals or clients. Needless to say, while formal or ritual speech (which is frequent) calls for Aslan to use their full names, nicknames are commonly used among intimates. Nicknames usually commemorate some supposed virtue or achievement and can be chosen and discarded whenever the holder desires.

In coming up with names or words for Aslan Travellers, places or things, a simple system for generating random, Aslan-sounding words is provided. This neatly avoids all considerations of syntax and vocabulary. Simply generate a word as desired and assign a suitable meaning to it, such as 'Killer of Ten Thousand' or, less bloodthirstily,
'He Honors His Ancestors' or 'Place of the North Wind'. Since Aslan does not translate well into English (most Aslan words are an entire phrase of meaning, much like written Chinese ideograms), meanings can vary considerably. Tehleikhoi is the name of an Aslan mercenary regiment; it can be translated as 'Soldiers of the Falling Night', 'Knights of the Setting Sun', or
'Warriors of the Evening Star'. There is a great deal of latitude in the development of Aslan words and names.

### Aslan Language

The Aslan common language is called _Trokh_. Humans find it difficult to learn but quite beautiful to listen to. For the most part, _Trokh_ is a lyrical tongue, although there is the occasional dissonant growl or roar. There are several dialects of _Trokh_ ; all of the major clans have their own version of the language and _Trokh_ has been greatly expanded by the females to cover scientific and economic topics. Common _Trokh_ can be understood by all Aslan but males are quickly left behind when females start talking in the technical dialects. A male dialect of _Trokh_ exists; this is a highly formal language, used in legal and political circles.

A few ultra-conservative clans preserve older Aslan languages, such as Trow or Haeto.

#### Aslan Script

The common Aslan writing system is composed of hundreds of glyphs called _Tao_. These glyphs were originally pictorial, coupled with several symbols that are clearly derived from claw-marks but have become greatly stylised. Common sentences can be understood with knowledge of only three dozen common _Tao_.

A scientific form of _Tao_ is used by females for technical purposes. On board an Aslan ship, consoles used by males will use simplified, traditional _Tao_ , while female controls will be labelled using the female glyphs to provide more accurate information.

#### Aslan Mathematics

The Aslan have four fingers, so they naturally use base 8 mathematics (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 20 and so on). Powers of 8 are therefore nice round numbers to the Aslan. An Aslan epic poem might say that 4096 warriors died in a battle or that a warrior took 64 wounds before dying; these are not precise measurements but the equivalent of a human saying 10,000 people fought in the battle or that the warrior took a 100 wounds.

#### Generating Aslan Words

Words in Aslan, like English, have definite letter frequencies and syllable patterns that are independent of information content; it is possible to randomly generate words that look and sound Aslan. Aslan syllables are composed of up to three elements; an initial consonant, a vowel and a final consonant. The Aslan sound frequency table shows the relative frequencies to be expected for various sounds in the Aslan language. For example, the relative frequency of
'f' as an initial consonant is 5:87 and that of 'h' as a final consonant is 10:47.

#### Pronunciations

This table is a guide to Aslan speech but many Aslan sounds are not reproducible by human vocal cords.

> [!info] Separately means that the two letters are pronounced separately but very close together. ^seperately

Aslan has four syllable types; those consisting of just a vowel (V), those beginning with a consonant (CV), those ending with a consonant (VC) and those both beginning and ending with a consonant (CVC). In Aslan words, their relative frequency of occurrence is about 3:3:2:2. Out of 10 syllables, three will be V, three will be CV, two will be VC and two will be CVC.

A few rules govern how sounds are grouped together. No syllable ending with a consonant can be followed by a syllable beginning with a consonant. A single letter vowel can never be followed directly by the same single letter vowel; for example, aa should not occur but aeae , or even aeei, could.

### ASLAN ANIMALS

The Aslan regularly import creatures from their homeworld of Kusyu to their new colonies. Most imported creatures are livestock, brought to supply the race's ceaseless hunger for fresh meat. A few are predators hunted by the Aslan for sport or creatures useful for other products or their place in the ecosystem.

#### AUA (HOOFMEAT)

```
ANIMAL HITS SPEED Aua (Hoofmeat) 30 6m SKILLS Melee 0, Survival 1 ATTACKS Horns (2D) TRAITS Armor (+1) BEHAVIOUR Herbivore, Grazer
```

_Aua_ are large herbivores that have been the Aslan's main prey for millions of years. Modern _Aua_ have been bred and genetically engineered to grow quickly, to thrive in a variety of environments and to consume a wide range of vegetable matter. _Aua_ look like a cross between a rhinoceros and a cow. They are quite docile under most circumstances.

#### AUA'KA

```
ANIMAL HITS SPEED Aua'ka 64 5m SKILLS Athletics (strength) 3, Melee (natural) 2, Recon 1, Survival 3 ATTACKS Horns (3D+3), Trample (6D) TRAITS Armor (+6) BEHAVIOUR Herbivore, Grazer
```

These huge animals are rare on Kusyu outside reservations but have been successfully transplanted to numerous colony worlds. The _aua'ka_ are titanic creatures, more like walking tanks than animals. Hunting an _Aua'ka_ is a difficult prospect, and best accomplished with a rocket launcher, but they are part of many Aslan ceremonial feasts.

#### ATEKTEIA

(SCORPION)

_Atekteia_ are large poisonous insects who lay their eggs in aua dung. The vermin have spread along with the Aslan livestock herds and now infest worlds across the galaxy. They are disturbingly resilient; the Aslan have used various methods to wipe out the insects but nothing keeps the species down for long.

```
ANIMAL HITS SPEED Atekteia (scorpion) 8 6m SKILLS Melee (natural) 1, Stealth 2 ATTACKS Sting (1D) TRAITS Poison (Difficult/1D/1D minutes) BEHAVIOUR Carnivore, Scavenger
```

#### KHTA

```
ANIMAL HITS SPEED Khta 28 10m SKILLS Athletics (dexterity) 2, Melee (natural) 1, Survival 1 ATTACKS Bite (2D), Hooves (1D+2) TRAITS None BEHAVIOUR Carnivore, Chaser
```

_Khta_ are fast-moving predators that the Aslan have domesticated and trained to use as mounts. _Khta_ resemble horses but they are primarily carnivorous. They are foul-tempered beasts and have a taste for human flesh.

#### STII

(MONKEYMEAT)

_Stii_ are small furry simian-like creatures about the size of a human child. They are omnivorous scavengers, eating almost anything from fruit and nuts to fabric and bark. The Aslan consider them a tasty snack and also keep them as living garbage disposals in small communities. Humans look like overgrown shaven stii to Aslan, a fact that never ceases to amuse them.

```
ANIMAL HITS SPEED Stii (Monkeymeat) 10 8m SKILLS Recon 1, Stealth 2, Survival 1 ATTACKS Teeth (1D) TRAITS Fast Metabolism (+2), Heightened Senses BEHAVIOUR Omnivore, Gatherer
```

#### Khekha

```
ANIMAL HITS SPEED Khekha 24 6m SKILLS Melee (natural) 1, Recon 1, Survival 2 ATTACKS Bite (2D) TRAITS Armor (+1) BEHAVIOUR Carnivore, Chaser
```

These predators are hunted by the Aslan for sport. They are highly aggressive and have been known to attack lone travellers.




# ASLAN TRAVELLERS

Traveller creation for Aslan follows the same procedures and concepts as described in the _Traveller Core Rulebook_. Although Aslan are covered on page 50 of the _Traveller Core Rulebook_ , it is assumed Travellers created that way were born and raised within the Imperium or, at least, human-based society. The _Traveller_ creation rules presented here are suitable for Aslan born and raised within the Hierate. Unless otherwise stated in this chapter, use all the creation and career rules described in the _Traveller Core Rulebook_.

As you will discover, an Aslan's gender and clan have far more bearing on the Traveller's career choices than those of a human.

## INITIAL TRAVELLER GENERATION

Use the characteristics and traits for Aslan Travellers shown on page 51 of the _Traveller Core Rulebook_.

However, male Aslan Travellers have an additional characteristic, Territory (TER), which starts at 0, and SOC for all Aslan is determined by Ancestral Territory, described below.

## Gender

Aslan may be either male or female. Aslan biology dictates there are approximately three females born for every male. As a result, males are in the distinct minority. Travellers may select their gender or it may be determined randomly on the Aslan Gender table.

### Aslan Gender Table

|  2D  | Gender |
| :--: | ------ |
|  2–5 | Male   |
| 6–12 | Female |

In Aslan society, males are permitted to be warriors, rulers and diplomats; females are the scientists, technicians, merchants and managers.

Territory The Territory (TER) characteristic is unique to the Aslan. TER measures the amount of land owned by that Aslan male. It is the foundation of Aslan SOC - for a landless male or female, his or her SOC is derived from the TER of his or her sire. A mated female's SOC is based on her mate's TER.

TER can be used in place of SOC. For example, instead of rolling Diplomat using his SOC DM, an Aslan lord could use roll Diplomat and add his TER DM instead.

In Aslan social contests between males, TER can be used to trump SOC – a male with TER may automatically win any social contests against a male who has less TER. Any amount of TER trumps any amount of SOC – the son of an Aslan clan head with TER 0 and SOC 15 will lose a contest to a penniless mercenary who has TER 1 and SOC 2. That does not mean that the mercenary is more important in Aslan society than the clan heir but he has Territory and that is what counts, and he can overrule the clan heir (of course, doing so would be a greivous insult and would likely result in some ally of the clan heir overriding the mercenary soon after).

## CLAN, FAMILY AND PRIDE

To determine if a Traveller comes from one of the 29 Great Clans of the Tlaukhu or a minor clan, roll on the Clan table, or the Referee may choose to dictate which clan the Traveller comes from. Note that if any Travellers are kinfolk with one another, they will share a clan and possibly a family.

### Clan Table

|  1D | Clan                                       |
| :-: | ------------------------------------------ |
| 1–3 | Minor Clan                                 |
| 4–6 | Major Clan. DM +1 to Ancestral Deeds roll. |

There are hundreds or thousands of families in a clan. To determine the SOC of the Traveller, roll on the Ancestral Deeds table and twice on the Past Deeds table to work out what Territory his forebears acquired. Ancestral Territory starts at 0. The first Past Deeds roll is for the deeds of their grandfather and the second is for the deeds of their father.

### Ancestral Deeds Table

|1D Ancestral Deeds
|1 Your ancestor shamed the clan and you come from a branch long dishonored. +0 Ancestral Territory
|2 Your family's glory days are long gone, all that is left is the tales of great landholdings now lost to upstarts. +0 Ancestral Territory
|3 Your family made its fortune in the great expansion after the discovery of jump drive; most family holdings are on distant worlds. + Ancestral Territory
|4 Your family are the descendants of an ancient hero forgotten by most Aslan. +1 Ancestral Territory
|5 Your family's ancestor was a trickster who deceived his enemies. +2 Ancestral Territory
|6 Your ancestors were conquerors and great warriors. +2 Ancestral Territory
|7 Your family is one of the most influential and wealthy in the Hierate. +3 Ancestral Territory

### Past Deeds Table

|2D Past Deeds
|2 Dishonored! Your forebear committed some dishonorable act that caused the clan to strip your family of all territory. Gain Independence 0 (if male) or Profession0 (if female). Lose all Ancestral Territory
|3 Your forebear was beset by many foes, one of whom conquered much of your land. Gain an Enemy and Gun Combat 0. –4 Ancestral Territory
|4 Your forebear was a fool who gambled away much of your land. Gain Gamble 0 or Carouse 0. –3 Ancestral Territory
|5 Your forebear suffered from a degenerative genetic disease that you may have inherited. Gain Medic 0. –2 Ancestral Territory
|6 Your forebear barely managed to hold onto your landhold. –1 Ancestral Territory
|7 +1 Ancestral Territory
|8 +2 Ancestral Territory
|9 +3 Ancestral Territory
|10 +4 Ancestral Territory
|11 +5 Ancestral Territory
|12 +6 Ancestral Territory

Only the first son in the family inherits the family Territory. Next, determine your Traveller's place in the family. In the case of multiple Travellers from the same family, only the eldest need roll on the Family Inheritance table – all other Travellers in that family are automatically younger.

### Family Inheritance Table

|2D| Male| Female|
|2–3| First Son| Eldest Daughter|
|4–10| Second Son| Middle Daughter|
|11–12 |Third Son| Youngest Daughter|

Finally, at the start of Traveller creation, the Traveller has left their parent's pride. The Traveller may become part of another pride through Life Events or form one during a campaign.

### STARTING AGE

Aslan Travellers begin their careers at 16 Aslan years of age (about 14 standard years). Careers are resolved on the basis of Aslan terms of service which are four Imperial years (4.5 Aslan years) each.

### NAMES

The material on [[#Aslan Language]]  gives some basic guidelines on names and words used by the Aslan. Travellers may wish to use Aslan names (if so, they are encouraged to pick relatively pronounceable ones!). There is no necessity for doing so, although it adds flavor and atmosphere to a campaign.

Even when names from the Aslan language are chosen, these are unlikely to be the individual's full names, since an Aslan name is a long, sonorous and intricate structure that changes to note the background, accomplishments and life of its owner. Names for game purposes are of necessity greatly shortened.

Because the particle ko on the end of an Aslan name means himself and is used exclusively by the head of a clan, care should be taken that an Aslan name ending in ko not be chosen unless the individual is the head of a clan (usually SOC 16).

### Titles

Aslan do not have titles, as such, although a high social standing may be denoted by certain portions of the individual's name. In Aslan society, the social level characteristic denotes the relative status of both the individual and his or her family but no special titles are applied for specific social levels.

Travellers have SOC equal to their Ancestral Territory. If you have SOC 10+ and are male, gain Leadership 1.

### AKUAEUHREKHYEH

(RITE OF PASSAGE)

At the age of 15 (Aslan years), all Aslan Travellers undergo a rite of passage, the _Akhuaeuhrekhyeh_. This rite tests the individual's fitness to enter society and has an impact on careers.

The actual rite is a test that examines the Traveller's abilities and qualities, and males and females undergo different rites.

A male Aslan rolls 2D, which is compared to each of his characteristics apart from TER. A Rite of Passage score is created by adding +1 for each characteristic greater than the roll.

_Example: Two male Aslan siblings, Hwelryr and Karinvyr both have the same characteristics: STR 10, DEX 7, END 8, INT 6, EDU 5, SOC 7. Hwelyr rolls a 6 for his rite of passage; Karinvyr rolls a 10._

_Hwelyr's Rite of Passage number is +4 (+STR, +DEX,
+END, +SOC). Karinvyr's Rite of Passage number is +0._

A female Aslan rolls 2D which is compared to INT, EDU and SOC. A Rite of Passage score is created by adding
+2 for each characteristic greater than the throw.

If doubles are rolled for the rite of passage, consult the Rite of Passage Events table.

### Rite of Passage Events Table

|Roll| Event|
|1+1| You are believed to have a great destiny, and the clan looks for great things from you. You must excel or disappoint your ancestors. He gains 1D Clan Shares.|
|2+2| Impressive Performance. You are given Cr as a reward for your exemplary performance in the rite.|
|3+3| You befriend one of the other young Aslan undergoing the rite that day. Gain a Contact.|
|4+4| One of the other Aslan undergoing the rite tries to outdo you. Gain a Rival.|
|5+5| You are wounded in one of the tests, leaving a distinctive scar across your fur.|
|6+6| I Will Not Fail! Your rite tests you to the limit, but you are determined not to give in. Gain END +1.|

## CAREERS

Aslan careers, in general, are used in the same way as described in the Traveller Core Rulebook. However, there are exceptions, which are noted here.

Note that some Aslan careers are restricted to a specific gender.

### Ceremonial

The Aslan have a rich cultural heritage. Those involved in ceremonial tasks occupy a position of great importance within their clans.

### Envoy

(Males only)

Interclan relations are often entrusted to specific Envoys empowered to arrive at agreements and commit clan resources. The term Envoy (rather than diplomat) is used because the individual represents a clan rather than a government.

### Management

(Females only)

Many female Aslan opt to enter a business-oriented career, rather than pursuing marriage and family. Such females may rise to positions of importance within the structure of various corporations. The career gives a variety of skills concerned with commerce, finance, and relations with others.

### Military and Military Officer

These careers are equivalent to both Army and Marine in the Traveller Core Rulebook. They represent clan military forces that may be employed in interclan warfare, on Hierate service, as mercenaries or as adjuncts to a corporation's activities where the military force is needed for security or other purposes.

Males in Military service are fighters or combatants; females are support personnel. Male Military Officers are commanders and leaders; females serve as staff and advisors.

### Outcast

Outcast Travellers, for one reason or another, do not fit within normal Aslan society. Generally scorned as misfits, they tend to pick up an unusual assortment of skills; frequently such Travellers will be more independent but also nurse a fierce desire to prove themselves and thus rejoin the society that has scorned them.

### Outlaw

Some Outcasts become Outlaws, travelling between the stars raiding other clans or other races. Such activities represent a deviant subculture within Aslan society; normal standards for male and female pursuits have broken down to some extent, with each learning and performing tasks of the other. Pirates, like Outcasts, privately nurse a desire to return to normal Aslan society but see little chance for success.

### Scientist

(Females only, with the exception of Healer)

Travellers involved in the pursuit of the sciences (whether biological, physical, or social) can become Scientists. In Aslan practice, most scientists are actually technicians, adept at the creation of mechanisms to accomplish specific tasks.

### Spacer and Space Officer

These two careers embrace all forms of interplanetary and interstellar service which may be carried out by a clan, including operation of all forms of spacecraft. Thus, the career is similar to both the Navy and Merchant (and to some extent, Scout) in the _Traveller Core Rulebook_. However, members of this career are strictly concerned with the operation of ships; a clan vessel involved in trade would also carry Travellers of a management background for the conduct of business.

Spacer males are primarily gunners; females are technicians or support personnel. Male Space Officers are pilots, gunners, and leaders; females are navigators, engineers, and staff advisors.

### Wanderer

(Males only)

Many _ihatei_ are given vessels by their clans and then use them for exploration in the hopes of discovering new landholds. Wanderers are much like the Scouts of the _Traveller Core Rulebook_ , exploring in a lonely, risky way which provides a wide range of skills but also great chance of disaster.

It should be emphasised that most careers (except Outcast and Outlaw) are governed on a clan level. The Hierate has no integrated Army or Navy; individual clans maintain forces which may be contributed to the service of the Hierate, or not, as the situation and attitudes of the clan dictate.

## QUALIFICATION

Once a career is selected, the Traveller attempts to qualify for it. For Aslan careers, the Rite of Passage score is used as a DM to qualify for all careers except for Outlaw and Scientist instead of the standard characteristic check. If the Traveller fails to qualify, they are immediately reduced to SOC 2 and become Outcast.

If any event during creation indicates the Traveller has become Outcast, they must either take the Outcast career in their next term or attempt to qualify for the Outlaw career. Alternatively, they may instead leave Aslan space and attempt to become a Rogue or Drifter from the Traveller Core Rulebook.

After serving at least three terms in a career (other than Outcast or Outlaw) an Aslan Traveller may attempt to qualify for another career or assignment using the standard rules – the Aslan are a more hidebound culture than the Imperium and expect Travellers to remain in a single career for some time. Aslan who have spent time as Outcasts or Outlaws may only attempt to qualify for other Outcast or Outlaw assignments while in Aslan space, as their past is too dishonorable to allow them to enter a more respectable career (such Travellers may be best served by either leaving Aslan space or mustering out and starting the campaign).

## SKILLS

The Aslan deal with skills primarily on a gender basis - males feel that some skills are dishonorable and beneath them; females feel that some skills are shallow or simply unsuitable. As a result, Aslan perceive and identify skills as common (available to both sexes), male (suitable only for males) and female (suitable only for females).

In addition, there are a few skills that a non-Aslan would classify as rare (generally unknown or unappreciated in Aslan society). On the rare occasions that an Aslan learns a skill inappropriate for his or her gender, that fact will usually be kept secret; for the fact to be revealed would be shameful. Further, Aslan society is rigid enough on the subject of skills that no respectable Aslan would hire someone for a job that required a skill inappropriate to the employee's gender.

At times, Aslan are forced to learn what they consider inappropriate skills in order to survive. For example, it is widely known that Wanderers often learn Engineering on the small ships they commonly use; polite society ignores this breach of propriety and a former Wanderer with Engineering skill would never discuss it and never expect to be hired as an engineer.

### New Skills for Aslan

The following two skills are unique to Aslan.

#### INDEPENDENCE

The Traveller is capable of dealing with the concepts of money. In Aslan society, money is traditionally a female responsibility and males (particularly upper-class males) rarely understand such matters, a fact that handicaps them in a technological society.

Independence is an Aslan male skill, acquirable only by males; females have no need of it. When Independence skill appears, males must roll 2D and score higher than their SOC to acquire the skill. Independence is a guide governing the Traveller's ability to function without supervision. Lack of the skill indicates no concept of money at all; the Traveller must be looked after by a wife or companion who can pay for things and generally see that he has his financial needs cared for.

Realising a Price is Extortionate : Average (8+) Independence check (INT or EDU) Understanding an Economics Treatise : Difficult (10+) Independence check (1D x 10 minutes, INT)

#### TOLERANCE

The Traveller is accustomed to dealing with non-Aslan and has learned to ignore lapses in propriety on the part of such persons. It should also be used to help determine the degree to which an Aslan is capable of getting along with others outside of the family, pride, clan and race. An Aslan without Tolerance is unlikely to be found in the company of non-Aslan.

In any Aslan's dealings with others, Tolerance offsets the negative DM called for under the reaction rules (see page 9).

### Male Skills

Some skills can be learned in Aslan society only by males. Females consider such skills naturally the province of males and rarely try to learn them. In some extreme circumstances, females may learn them but will almost never admit to it in polite company. Most direct combat skills are the province of males.

Independence is a uniquely Aslan male skill in that it indicates the degree to which the male has overcome Aslan cultural and psychological barriers to the comprehension of money. Females do not need Independence since they are not faced with these barriers.

### Female Skills

Some skills can be learned in Aslan society only by females. Males consider such skills dishonorable for them to learn and will avoid learning them if at all possible. If they have learned them, honor forbids them from admitting it.

### Rare Skills

These skills may be learned by Aslan but are extremely rare.

The Aslan Skills table indicate which skills various Aslan might consider distasteful or unacceptable to learn. The rare Aslan skills table shows skills that very few Aslan would learn.

Skills not shown as male, female or rare may be considered common skills.

## AGING

Aslan aging is slower in its onset but more severe in effects than in human Travellers. The first roll on the Aging table is not made until age 40 (after six terms of service have been completed); thereafter, it is checked every term and _twice_ the Traveller's number of terms served is applied as a negative DM to the roll.

Science is an almost exclusively female occupation among the Aslan. The exception is that of doctor as, by ancient tradition, males are allowed to practice the art of the physician. This custom is believed to date back to days when males fought on the battlefield and so had need of healers – and had plenty of practical anatomy lessons. This tradition is rarely observed these days.

## MUSTERING OUT

Aslan receive mustering out Benefits when they leave the service as normal.

### Kinships

Kinships are secret societies and trade guilds within Aslan society. A Traveller given membership in a kinship may ask other members of the kinship for aid, learn skills or obtain funding for further studies related to the kinship's purpose. There are scientific kinships, engineering kinships, warrior secret schools and so forth.

### Pensions

There is no pension system for Aslan. An old Aslan should have accumulated Clan Shares to have enough money to live on.

### Cash Benefits

Females, being more skilled in handling financial matters, may consult the Cash column any number of times. Males are restricted to consulting the Cash column no more times than they have levels of the Independence skill; in addition, males receive only half the amount rolled for.

### Other Benefits

Some Benefits are unique to Aslan.

### Brotherhood of Stars

This grand kinship of starfarers grants the Traveller one free Low Passage per month and one free High Passage per year.

### Ceremonial Kinship

A Traveller who is a member of a ceremonial kinship gains D3 Allies within the Aslan hierarchy.

### Clan Shares

Aslan Travellers do not receive Ship Shares. Instead, they receive Clan Shares, which represent the clan placing an increasing amount of trust in the Traveller's abilities and the Traveller gaining more control over the assets of the clan.

A Traveller may trade Clan Shares for any of the following benefits. Travellers from the same clan may combine Clan Shares.

### - Cash

A Traveller may trade Clan Shares for simple cash. Each Clan Share gives the Traveller Cr10000.

### - Corporation

The Traveller owns an operating corporation. It has MCr500000 in assets per Clan Share spent and produces gross profits equal to 1D-5% of its assets per year. The Traveller need not do anything to administer the corporation but may become involved if desired.

### - Favors

Clan Shares can be kept in reserve, and used to apply political pressure to the clan in the future. A Clan Share can be spent to acquire a Contact in the clan's upper echelons, or turn such a Contact into an Ally.

### - Land

This option can only be taken by a male Aslan with SOC 9+. The Traveller receives a landhold. Owning lands is the dream of all Aslan males, the chief ambition which drives them. To determine the landholding's quality and size, first select or generate the world where the landhold is located. The size of the holding on that world is then determined based on the number of Clan Shares invested in the holding. Three Clan Shares grants TER +1.

### - Ship Shares

Clan Shares may be converted to Ship Shares directly on a one-for-one basis.

Scientific Kinship: A scientific kinship is a school of experts on a topic. A Traveller who is a member of a scientific kinship may make a Difficult (10+) SOC check once per year; if successful, they obtain the use of a kinship laboratory ship for six months.

Scout Ship: This is as detailed on page 45 of the Traveller Core Rulebook , but will instead be an Ihateisho scout ship, as detailed on page 72.

Secret School: A secret warrior school teaches secret combat techniques. In addition to being part of this brotherhood of warriors, the Traveller may obtain DM+1 to attack rolls in any one of the following situations:

### - Melee (natural)

When duelling

### - Gun Combat (energy)

After having aimed for at least two rounds

### - Gun Combat (slug)

## ASLAN LIFE EVENTS

Outcast Aslan must use the Life Events table on page 44 of the Traveller Core Rulebook , reflecting their disconnection from Aslan society. All others use the Aslan Life Events table.

Aslan equipment is broadly similar to human items. While the aesthetics are different – Aslan items are bigger and heavier, and much more likely to include natural materials like wood, fur or bone, or at least synthetics that resemble natural materials – both races are physiologically similar and Aslan borrowed much of their advanced technology from humanity.

There are obvious differences between items made for Aslan males and those made for females. Male items, such as most weapons, are simplified to the point of elegance (or beyond). A human laser rifle has a wealth of options and controls, allowing the user to set power consumption rates, adjust the weapon's focus, connect the weapon to different types of heads-up-displays or diagnostic equipment and conduct field repairs. An Aslan laser rifle has an on-off switch and a trigger. Nothing comes between the warrior and his kill. There are no distractions, no fuss, no pointless female's work – just the kill.

By contrast, female Aslan items have a wealth of controls and options, and seem overcomplicated or even deliberately obfuscated to human operators. This is partly because of the Aslan love for decoration; every item of worth is engraved, gilded, jewelled or adorned in some fashion. It also serves to reinforce the cultural bias of the Aslan that technical topics are the preserve of females.

In cases where an item is designed to be used by both genders, such as a vehicle, there will generally be two sets of controls, or else a core control system and a wealth of secondary controls. In general though, the further one gets from the core Aslan worlds and the influence of the _Tlaukhu_ culture, the more the two strands of Aslan interface design merge – rough colony worlds do not always have the luxury to accommodate what is essentially a cultural affectation.

The Aslan have reached TL14 but are well behind the Imperium in several key fields.

## PERSONAL PROTECTION

Armor is a much more common sight in Aslan society than it is on human worlds. Most upper-class males will at least wear ceremonial armor as part of their daily wardrobe and virtually all military personnel habitually wear heavier body armor than a human would feel comfortable in. Aslan armor is always ornately decorated and includes furs and other natural materials.

Many suits of armor also include full-face masks made to resemble the features of the wearer or an ancestor. These masks are a sign of prestige among the Aslan and worn only by those of high status.

Unless otherwise noted, an Aslan may use his dewclaw while wearing armor.

### AUA-LEATHER

Aua-hide clothing is the traditional garb of most Aslan warriors and the heavy, musky stench of the leather is part of the bouquet of every Aslan world and starship. The Aslan produce so much aua-hide that it is used for everything from armor to cargo restraints to children's toys.

### ASLAN BATTLE DRESS

Aslan battle dress is bulkier and less advanced than human designs. It lacks the built-in computer of human suits (and so does not come with the electronics suite described in the _Central Supply Catalogue_ ) but offers six hours of life support and protection from environmental hazards. An Aslan may not use a dewclaw while wearing this armor.

It is designed for stealth rather than protection and granting the wearer DM+1 to Stealth checks. An Aslan may not use a dewclaw while wearing this armor. More advanced versions replace the armor plates with a reactive layer that becomes rigid when struck and also incorporates the Vislight Chameleon option (see _Traveller Core Rulebook_ , page 96).

## CEREMONIAL BREASTPLATE

These ornamental breastplates are designed to deflect the razor-sharp dewclaws of an attacker, and are not strong enough to stand up to a bullet. Most Aslan nobles of SOC 9+ will wear one of these breastplates at all times – wearing such armor without the requisite SOC is considered discourteous.

## COMBAT ARMOR

Su'yerl armor is a common sight on the battlefields of the Hierate. It uses a sandwich of composite materials over a 0.5cm layer of bonded superdense plating and is then coated in a reflec lacquer. The armor is too heavy for most humans to wear and even Aslan warriors find long fights in su'yerl to be difficult propositions. Travellers with STR 8- suffer DM-2 to all checks involving physical actions while wearing su'yerl.

All standard modifications listed in the _Traveller Core Rulebook_ (page 96) or _Central Supply Catalogue_ (page 27) may be used with Aslan armor. In addition, some are unique to the Hierate.

**A03/75674 HEAVY VACC SUIT** Heavy vacc suits are designed for use in hostile environments, much like the human HEV suit. The _suya'uiyekhva_ includes powered actuators to aid the wearer's movements, as well as a limited built-in artificial intelligence to advise male wearers on correct operation. It offers 12 hours of life support, although an Aslan may not use a dewclaw while wearing this armor.

## CLAW PORT

A claw port allows an Aslan to use his dewclaws in combat while wearing armor. Basic claw ports are flexible orifices that are hooked onto the muscles at the base of the claw. When the Aslan unsheathes his claw, the movement pulls the claw port open. More advanced claw ports, designed for use in hostile environments, allow the claw to be extruded without damaging the suit. Aslan planning to use their claws in such environments should invest in Claw Coating (see page 58). A claw port must be of at least the same TL as the armor it is fitted to.

A necessity for any Traveller on an Aslan world, the boundary box contains maps of the planet's surface as well as a database demonstrating which territory is owned by which Aslan noble. The box signals the Traveller when he is about to cross into an Aslan's territory, ensuring he does not inadvertently cause offence. Additional maps for a boundary box cost Cr25.

### CLAN COMM

The standard Aslan personal communicator has dedicated channels for the owner's family, pride and clan in addition to normal comm features. The gift of a clan comm to an outsider is an expression of trust and honor; illegal possession of another clan's comm is an insult.

Item TL Kg Cost Bio-adjustment Pills 8 — Cr20

### SLASHPATCH

The slashpatch is a specialized bandage designed to treat dewclaw cuts. It glues the wound shut and releases painkillers and clotting agents at a rate optimized to deal with slashing injuries. If a slashpatch is applied within one minute of a claw attack, it immediately heals 1D points of damage.

Item TL Kg Cost Slashpatch 6 — Cr5

## PERSONAL AUGMENTATION

The Aslan of the Hierate frown on augmentation and genetic engineering. Cybernetics are a necessary evil, as many Aslan are maimed in duels or wars and need replacement limbs but attempts to improve the species through technology are against tradition. Other Aslan states such as the Glorious Empire are less conservative and permit limited augmentation.

All the augmentations listed in the _Traveller Core Rulebook_ will be available somewhere in Aslan space but often at a cost of at least 50% higher than normal.

### A11/58231 CLAW COATING

This augmentation covers the Aslan's dewclaw in a polymer seal that protects it from environmental damage such as extremes of temperature and pressure.

### CLAW EDGING

This augmentation sharpens a dewclaw and lines its cutting edge with a blade so sharp it approaches monofilament. It also includes all the benefits from Claw Hardening and increases the damage from a successful claw attack to 3D. At TL14, the Claw Edging is enhanced with an arc-field, increasing damage to 5D with AP30. Arc-field weapons cannot be parried by any weapon of a lower Tech Level.

Item TL Cost Claw Edging 11 Cr6000 Arc-Field Claw Edging 14 Cr25000

### CLAW HARDENING

Claw hardening weaves carbon nanotubes and bands of tough synthetics into a dewclaw, making it tougher than most armor. A Traveller with claw hardening can scratch a starship hull or parry an attack from a chainsaw without damage. A dewclaw that has been augmented with Claw Hardening inflicts 2D damage.

Item TL Cost Claw Hardening 10 Cr3000

### CLAW IMPLANT

Human Travellers living in Aslan space are at a disadvantage as they lack dewclaws. They can carry _hi'a'soi_ blades or, alternatively, can go all the way and have an artificial dewclaw implanted into the forearm. The human claw is embedded into the forearm; when unsheathed, it slides forward and projects under the palm. A human with a claw implant may make claw attacks dealing 1D damage.

Item TL Cost Claw Implant 10 Cr5000

### PREDATOR SUITE

This enhancement was developed by the _Awyraolr_ clan during the Kinstrife and is banned throughout Aslan space. Nonetheless, some clans have kept the technology and even refined it. The predator suite sharpens the recipient's senses and tweaks the endocrine system, enhancing the predator instincts of the Aslan. This augmentation increases the recipient's STR, DEX and END by +2 permanently, although INT and EDU are both reduced by –2, and DM-4 is applied to all Tolerance checks.

Item TL Cost Predator Suite 12 Cr100000

### A11/58231 PREHENSILE TAIL

This modification implants artificial nerve and muscle cells into the tail, strengthening it and increasing its fine motor control, allowing the Aslan to effectively use the tail as a third limb. A Traveller with a prehensile tail may take an extra minor action in any combat round, so long as this minor action can be accomplished with the tail.

Item TL Cost Prehensile Tail 11 Cr12000

## WEAPONS OF HONOUR

Unless otherwise stated, all the weapons here use the Melee (blade) skill.

### A11/58231 ASSASSIN'S BLADE

The traditional weapon of an assassin is a curved blade, often with funnels in the blade containing poison. The delivery of a _soisu'soi_ is part of the ceremony that begins a War of Assassins. Modern blades are made of sensor-baffling materials, fold down to the size of a small coin and contain poison tailored to the metabolism and genetics of the intended family. An Aslan of the target genetic family who is struck by a modern assassin's blade must make a Difficult (10+) END check or suffer another 1D damage every hour for the next 1D hours.

### A11/58231 FIERAH

The _fierah_ is a strip of flexible material (originally hide, now frequently plastic) approximately 150cm in length and frequently worn like a sash or belt. It can be used in a variety of ways – looped, it can be used to snare or throttle an opponent using the Melee (unarmed) skill; it can also be used as a sling or the loose strands at each end can be tied around weights to form an improvised flail or bolo (taking two rounds), using the Gun Combat (archaic) skill. Highly decorated _fierah_ are part of the traditional costume of a noble.

### MONKEY KNIFE

_Hi'asoi_ are ceremonial weapons used by humans who have integrated into Aslan society. The blade resembles a dewclaw, and is worn strapped to the wrist, allowing a human to fight in duels, using the blade as a proxy claw. The chances of survival against an Aslan male are, of course, minimal.

### REAVER'S AXE

An oversized great-axe, the _yuhaih_ is a weapon of terror, as it makes a thunderous noise as it is whirled through the air. Dewclaws are needed to wield the _yuhaih_ properly, as the wielder's claws slot into a round hole in the shaft, allowing him to spin it at great speed before he drives it into a foe's skull.

### SPEAR-HOOK

A combination of spear (at one end) and four-pronged grappling hook (at the other), the yurletya is 250cm in length and was a favorite duelling weapon of early Aslan cultures. It is still frequently used for ritual or ceremonial purposes. After any attack is made with the weapon, regardless of the result, a second attack may be made immediately after at DM-2.

### YEHEAL AUTORIFLE

This automatic rifle functions much like the human model and can be equipped with shoulder sling, sights, bipod and muzzle brake, and may be switched from semi-automatic to full automatic fire as needed. The _yeheal_ is magazine fed; it uses a dual magazine feed with an internal mechanism that strips cartridges from one magazine until it is empty and then proceeds to strip cartridges from the other. As a result, the total magazine capacity is a massive 64 rounds and the weapon can be reloaded with a single new magazine whenever the remaining rounds are less than 32.

### GRAVITY SPEAR

This weapon is a recent breakthrough by the Aslan and still largely experimental. It works on the same principle as a gravity plate or repulsor, projecting a 'lance' of gravitational force forward. Anything within the path of the beam is subjected to a 10G force, pulling it towards or away from the _hlaulrakh_. The _hlaulrakh's_ beam flickers on and off a dozen times a second and circles around a small area, causing thousands of tears and fractures in the internal organs of the target. Armor is never counted against the damage caused by the gravity spear.

### Heavy Weapons

Unless otherwise stated, all the weapons here use the Heavy Weapons (man portable) skill.

WEAPONS OF THE HUNT

When it comes to firearms, Aslan have many equivalents with slug weapons of the Imperium and other races, with Hierate-manufactured autopistols, autorifles and submachine guns commonly found throughout Aslan space. However, the Aslan have developed some weapons that have arisen directly from their culture and history.

The _trakhtyaua_ (laser pistol), _triluealikhe_ (laser carbine) and _trolitakheal_ (laser rifle) are functionally identical to human models and, indeed, were originally based on borrowed human technology. Only ergonomics to accommodate differing physiology and cultural bias were changed.

Unless otherwise stated, all the weapons here use the Gun Combat (slug) skill.

### PLASMA STREAMER

A primitive version of the human PGMP, this weapon lacks the magnetic containment needed to focus the plasma blast into a coherent beam. The _wye'oiheasarl_ is fired much like a flamethrower, vomiting a stream of star-hot matter over a wide area. Proper use of the wye'oiheasarl requires proper protective gear (the operator takes 1D damage when the _wye'oiheasarl_ is fired, although this damage can be reduced by armor).

This is a massive drum-fed machine gun that fires explosive bullets. In human terms, it is a support weapon but large Aslan males can and do carry it as a personal weapon. The roar of the _taoyuhrir_ heralds a hail of destruction. The _Taoyuhrir_ requires the Heavy Weapons (man portable) skill.

Heavy tracked crawlers are multipurpose utility vehicles. The four track sections are individually powered, giving the vehicle considerable agility at the cost of power and added complexity. The body of the crawler is akin to a flattened dome but is divided into sections with a healthy amount of space for passengers to make long journeys comfortable. The driver's cab is located in the front third of the dome.

A successful Mechanics check and a suitable crane allows the rear section of the dome to be removed, effectively making the Crawler a flatbed carrier. This reduces Passengers to 1 (to sit alongside the driver) but increases Cargo capacity to 8 tons.

Military crawlers have only 1.75 tons of cargo space but feature a second dome with a small turret. These versions cost Cr295000.

ARMOR

A variation on grav platforms, grav barges are large, stately vehicles used by Aslan as semi-mobile bases when travelling through their territory. The barge hovers using anti-gravity suspensors but is propelled by sails or drawn by beasts of burden like a giant flying chariot. Most grav barges can actually move under their own power but it is considered gauche to actually fly a grav barge; the whole point of the vehicle is to slowly tour one's territory in a traditional manner. Understandably, grav barges tend to undergo a great deal of customization – fortunately, space is the one thing they do not lack.

Despite outward appearances, Aslan ships use much the same technology as human vessels and either race can readily utilise ships belonging to the other with a minimum of difficulty. However, Aslan do display a slightly different approach towards ships and this is reflected in their design.

Aslan have no special regard for luxury and the Hierate does not have separate High Passage tickets. All paid passages are Middle, Basic or Low. However, any Aslan of SOC 9+ will receive the services of the ship's steward automatically and the Middle Passage baggage allowance increases to 500 kilograms. Aslan nobles always have precedence and usually bump passengers of lesser standing. Working Passage is common within a clan but rarely available to non-clan members.

The following are customs within Aslan space.

### Space is not Territory

No Aslan male may claim a region of space. A Traveller need not ask permission to enter any region of space – but before he puts a single foot on the ground, he must give all traditional honors to the landowner.

### Clan Hospitality

There is a strong tradition that 'the clan takes care of its own'. If members of a Traveller's clan live on a particular world, they will offer free food and lodging and provide a Middle Passage ticket upon a Difficult (10+) Persuade check. Outcasts or Travellers who have been Outcasts are not extended this hospitality.

Referees can determine the presence of an Aslan's clan on a world through materials they have previously prepared; alternatively, roll 10+ on 2D, modified by the Clan Presence table.

### Clan Presence

Condition DM Local Population 9+ +1 Local Government type H +1 Aslan is member of one of the Tlaukhu clans +2 Per sector distant from the clan homeworld –1

### Swapping Stories

Aslan with time on their dewclaws enjoy telling stories of their exploits and adventures. During the long days of a space journey, the passengers (and crew with no immediate jobs to perform) meet in the galley or central lounge and take turns telling stories of what they have seen, what they have done and what they plan to do.

Participants in these story-swapping sessions gain acceptance into the group as well as diversion from the boredom of a long journey. In addition, the stories told are often the source of further adventures or expeditions.

Decoration: Aslan ships are invariably heavily decorated with inscriptions and clan heraldry; even control systems can be decorated with gold, jewels or other art. Even on military vessels, the Aslan like to decorate their surroundings.

CREWS

Aslan crew standards vary since there is no central authority to prescribe the number and type of crew required. The fundamentals of ship operation mean the requirements for pilot, astrogator and engineer are the same as for human ships. Pilots are almost always male; astrogators and engineers are almost always female.

Stewards are not required. Most properly staffed ships will include at least one because noble males taking passage on any ship require the services of one steward per four nobles and if no proper steward is provided, another crew member will be co-opted for the position. A well-prepared ship thus provides a steward in order to avoid losing an engineer or astrogator at the wrong moment.

Medics are not required either; the position of medic is filled when the ship's owner feels it necessary or when the crew demands it forcefully enough.

Because of the nature of Aslan society and upbringing, most ships have a male in formal command of the ship and a female who deals with many details (specifically finances) that are beneath the male's dignity. The male captain is almost always the pilot. On military ships, the female is the captain's executive officer, while on commercial ships, she will be the purser. In both cases, she may also be the astrogator.

Purser: A merchant ship engaged in commercial activity, trade, commerce, cargo transport, passenger transport or charter activity must have a purser. Invariably, the purser will be female and must have a minimum of either Admin 1 or Broker 1. The purser is paid a salary of Cr5000 per month.

The Aslan Crew Requirements table replaces that on page 29 of High Guard.

- This can be presumed to be an average taken across

all officer positions on a ship. In practice, it will vary a great deal between junior and senior officers.

Note that any smaller craft carried by a ship will have their own crew in addition to those necessary for the mother vessel.

### Societal Standards

Because of expectations within Aslan society, all but pirate ships will restrict crew positions to the proper gender. Only males may be gunners and pilots. Only females will be astrogators, pursers, engineers, medics and stewards. Otherwise undefined crew positions (security personnel, mechanics, technicians, small craft pilots, and clerks) are open to any properly skilled individuals, although noble males will refuse most positions other than gunner or pilot.

## ASLAN CONTROL SYSTEMS

Aslan controls fall into four categories – male, female, dual and reconfigurable. Male controls are deliberately simplified and abstracted, displaying only the most vital information. Female control displays are overly complex, giving a bewildering array of options to the user and requiring great skill to master. Dual controls include both male and female control systems in the one system; either the male controls are a clearly demarcated subset of the female controls or the control system is compact enough to have two entirely separate interfaces. Finally, reconfigurable controls are the most advanced and can dynamically change themselves to present the appropriate interface.

On most large spacecraft, the piloting and gunnery interfaces are male, while all other control systems are female. Dual controls are more common on smaller ships, where a smaller crew makes it more likely that an Aslan will have to perform duties commonly associated with the opposite gender. Ships built at TL13 or higher always have reconfigurable controls throughout.

A female Aslan will never suffer penalties for using male-configured controls (although she will likely become frustrated at their simplicity), but male Aslan using female-configured controls suffer DM-2 to all relevant checks.

Aslan dislike automated systems, so few Aslan ships come equipped with Evade programs and Fire Control software only offers DMs to attack rolls – it cannot make automated attacks by itself.

## SHRINES

All Aslan ships carry a Shrine to Heroes, where Aslan go to meditate on (and gain confidence from) the thoughts, deeds and philosophies of their ancestors. This is typically a small, private room, draped in tapestries and decorated with scenes of conquest.

An Aslan ship of more than 100 tons must have at least one Shrine to Heroes (smaller ships may have them at the option of their owners) and larger ships must have at least one per 10,000 tons. A Shrine is treated as if it were a normal stateroom (consumes four tons and costs MCr0.5) but it cannot be used for occupancy and does not incur any life support costs.

## HRAYE-CLASS SCOUT

Using a 100-ton hull, the Hraye scout is intended primarily for exploration duties (the variant Ihateisho -class scout is a more common sight outside Hierate space). This ship requires a crew of two, pilot and engineer/astrogator (although one individual with pilot, engineer and astrogator skills can handle the ship alone). The Hraye's cheap running cost means these vessels are often found serving as couriers or transports in small colonies.

## IHATEISHO-CLASS SCOUT

This is one of the iconic Aslan vessels. Ships of this design are given to the ihatei of nobles, to roam the galaxy in search of territories to conquer. Contrary to most Aslan vessels, the controls of this ship have a high degree of automatation, to allow less than technically adept males operate it without female help.

The ihateisho is capable of making four-parsec jumps, allowing it to reach systems beyond the range of a standard scout. A typical ihateisho exploration lasts two to three years, at which point the wanderer returns to the nearest ihatei camp and gathers an army to conquer the most suitable territory found during his wandering. The ihateisho is then either returned to the clan or traded for a share in a larger vessel. An ihateisho is sometimes considered especially lucky if former owners have gone on to find good territories.

## EAKHAU-CLASS TRADER

The Eakhau is an Aslan tramp trader, commonly crewed by a single family. Nomadic Aslan families travel in this fashion as part of a pride-fleet of a dozen or so ships and whole generations can be born, live and die on these cramped vessels before the pride finds suitable territory. Out of the shipyard, 11 tons of space is unallocated but new owners quickly fill this with weapons, vehicles and other optional extras.

The Eakhau is one of the few Aslan designs to carry escape pods, which are seen as inviting failure. A true warrior will never flee.

## KHTUKHAO-CLASS CLAN TRANSPORT

Using a 600-ton hull, this clan transport is a large freight and passenger vessel used by clans and companies upon major trade routes. A 95-ton shuttle is carried as ship's vehicle which, with a generous passenger or cargo capacity means the transport does not require a streamlined hull itself and the shuttle's cargo bay is often utilised to increase the total tonnage this ship can carry.

## KTIYHUI-CLASS COURIER

Using a heavily armored 200-ton hull, the Ktiyhui -class courier is a fast, long-range ship used to conduct clan business across interstellar distances. As the courier is often used to carry important dignitaries and nobles, it dedicates space to various luxuries, usually either a harem or holographic hunting ground.

## IYELIY-CLASS MESSENGER

The Iyeliy -class is the Aslan equivalent of the Imperial X-boat. Larger clans have a network of these vessels and some Aslan news corporations have their own fleets to relay information across the Hierate. The Aslan network is much less extensive than the Imperial X-boat system but the Iyeliy are capable of five-parsec jumps and so information moves faster within the Hierate. Due to the limited crew positions on the messenger ship, astrogation is often relegated to Intellect software, unless the female purser/engineer is unusually skilled.

## AOSITAOH-CLASS CRUISER

Using a 1,000-ton hull, the Aositaoh-class cruiser is built for small-scale clan troop transport and combat operations. Ten triple turrets are installed, typically mounting six triple beam lasers, three triple missile racks and one triple sandcaster. The ship also carries a launch, two pinnaces, four ATVs and four air/rafts; the pinnaces can each carry two ATVs, allowing the cruiser to deploy a considerable fighting force comprising two full platoons from orbit.

Both this ship and the Ekawsiykua-class escort have low cargo capacities for their size and are often accompanied by Owatarl-class tenders.

## EKAWSIYKUA-CLASS ESCORT

Using an 800-ton hull, the Ekawisykua - class escort is a military vessel employed by clans for space patrol and combat duties and are often encountered alongside Aslan freighters. Eight triple turrets mount three triple lasers, three triple missile racks and two triple sandcasters, while inside the ship carries two armed pinnaces and five fighters for scouting and patrol duties.

## OWATARL-CLASS TENDER

The Owatarl -class are military tenders but also see use as corporate freighters in regions where normal cargo ships would be vulnerable to attack. Three turrets provide basic cover, although many Owatarls refit some of their cargo bay to carry auxiliary fighters. The tender is unable to land, so it carries a shuttle for cargo transfer. Tenders assigned to supply other ships may replace the shuttle bay with a suite of repair drones and smaller launches.

## KTEIROA-CLASS SEEKER

Using a 200-ton hull, the Kteiroa -class seeker is a prospecting vessel adapted to explorations in asteroid belts. Unlike many similar ships, there are four staterooms - more than the crew needs but Kteriroa are commonly also used as transports in isolated systems.

## HKIYRERAO-CLASS RESEARCHER

Using a 400-ton hull, the Hkiyrerao -class researcher was designed to investigate scientific phenomena and conduct tests around newly discovered worlds. The ship carries one pinnace and one GCarrier as vehicles, along with a fully-equipped scientific laboratory that can cater to the needs of up to 10 scientists.

## SAKHAI-CLASS ASSAULT CARRIER

These heavy carriers are designed for invasions and open wars. If a Sakhai appears in the skies over a world, then it will be under the claw in a matter of days. The Sakhai's distinctive 'horseshoe' profile allows its batteries of beam lasers and missile racks to rake targets on either side, while protecting the mighty fusion bay mounted in the center. It can carry 160 marines in addition to its normal 40-person crew; there are another 200 low berths for frozen troops or captives.

While the Sakhai is capable of landing on a planet, it takes a skilled hand at the controls and a dedicated team of engineers to keep the ship spaceworthy after touching down. A bad landing can warp the ship's dorsal struts, effectively crippling it. Many far flung Aslan outposts have a downed Sakhai at their hearts.

## HKISYELEAA-CLASS SLAVER

The slaver is commonly associated with the Glorious Empire but it can be found throughout the Hierate. They are converted agricultural transports, with the low berths designed for freezing large food animals. A Hkisyeleaa would land on an agricultural planet and load up on hundreds of live animals, taking them to be devoured by rich nobles.

The Glorious Empire has adapted their Hkisyeleaas for slave raiding. Unfortunate humans are captured by Aslan raiders riding ATVs and thrown into the freezing chambers. A fully-stocked Slaver can carry more than 1,500 slaves if the captain is willing to cram as many bodies as possible into the low berths; 750 is more of a safe number. Slavers are comparatively lightly armed and have little protection from attackers, so are normally escorted by more combat-ready ships.

#### Overcrowding Low Berths

Only the most callous captain would intentionally set out to squeeze two bodies into one low berth, as this is highly dangerous and subjects are unlikely to survive without the best medical treatment available upon their awakening. A low berth subjected to double occupancy will inflict DM-4 to any Medic check used to revive its occupants.

## AOA'IW-CLASS LIGHT TRADER

A popular design inside the Hierate, especially within the Trojan Reach, the little Aoa'iw is a 300-ton trader that combines a sizable cargo bay with space for passengers, enough firepower to serve as a raider or defend itself from piracy and vehicles to support a flexible mission profile. Aoa'iws are often owned by clans, as they are capable of performing a wide variety of tasks. On the border worlds, the Aoa'iw is nicknamed the 'pouncer', as it does resemble a crouching animal from certain angles.

## HALAHEIKE-CLASS POCKET WARSHIP

This so-called 'pocket warship' is a 1,200-ton spacecraft used by smaller clans for military operations. The Halaheike is heavily armed for its size, with a range of missile racks, lasers and particle beams and carries a fighter complement of ten fighters and two launches for boarding actions and customs inspections. Some owners convert the cargo bay to hold troops or some 200 low berths (although this will put a serious strain on the power plant), allowing the Halaheike to serve as a troop transport. The design is known for maintenance issues and jump drive failures but the vessel's main problem is that it tries to do too much in one package, requiring the most advanced Aslan technology just to function. The Halaheike might be a carrier, assault cruiser, system defence boat and troop carrier all in one but is sub-par in all those roles. Larger clans that can afford specialist vessels rarely field Halaheikes.

From [[Behind the Claw]]
# Aslan of the Marches

There are no Aslan worlds in [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]] but there are Aslan populations on several. Some are integrated into the local population (such as in the Darrian Confederation) while others remain aloof in their own settlements. Some are present legally and with the blessings of the world government; some are squatters who have simply grabbed land, a common practice among Aslan _ihatei_ , or 'second sons'. Aslan males value land ownership very highly but only the primary heir inherits. Some males are happy to serve their clan in a subordinate role. The _ihatei_ are the others; those who have set out to make their own fortune.

_Ihatei_ settlements sometimes trade in goods or services, with several worlds having units of Aslan mercenaries as part of their planetary armed forces. Others are simply armed camps whose inhabitants just want to be left alone and are prepared to repel any attempt to interfere with their plans.

Aslan society is very male-dominated, with females taking supporting roles as managers, technicians and scientists while the males are pilots, soldiers and leaders. This can make them difficult to deal with but, in many ways, Aslan are easier to get along with than Sword Worlders.

Aslan have a strict culture of duty and honor, and can be insulted very easily by those that do not understand their ways. Some Aslan are more understanding about the cultural ignorance of outsiders but the basics of Aslan etiquette (enough not to get into serious trouble)
can be quickly picked up, enabling interaction with Aslan without being challenged to a duel.

Aslan trade ships and mercenary units are common in [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]], with _ihatei_ settlements restricted mainly to the spinward-rimward corner of the sector.
Individuals and small groups have settled on many worlds and are unlikely to attract comment from most Imperial governments.
