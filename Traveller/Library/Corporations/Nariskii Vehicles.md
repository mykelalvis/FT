Nariskii is a business group based in the [[Lunion subsector]]. The firm has its origins in a number of companies that provided new and refurbished all–terrain and grav vehicles to early explorers in the sector. After a long period on the fringes, Nariskii has grown rapidly in the past few years, opening manufacturing plants in several worlds. Products are mostly budget and mid–range utility vehicles ranging from Air/Rafts through ATVs to more humble work trucks.
