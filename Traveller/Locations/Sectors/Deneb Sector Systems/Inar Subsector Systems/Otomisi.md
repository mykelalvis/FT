### OTOMISI

Otomisi is a hostile world located within the sector's largest cluster, important mainly for its chemical industry with few visitors descending to the surface other than for business. The high-quality orbital port sees a considerable volume of traffic but Otomisi's balance of trade is very much skewed in the direction of specialist chemical exports and everything the population needs as imports.

Otomisi's exotic atmosphere can become highly toxic under the right conditions, as chemicals are liberated from the ocean to form dense fogs. These roll over low ground and into valleys, making these regions hazardous to enter. However, this phenomenon also makes

extraction of chemical compounds relatively easy, so there are numerous installations along the coasts. These have a sealed environment, with workers trained in the use of protective equipment but receive few visitors.
Anyone who does not have to work in the toxic fogs of Otomisi chooses not to.

Not all areas are affected. High ground is generally safe, as are inland areas. However, unusual temperature and pressure conditions can cause a toxic fog to form in areas not normally prone to them. The small cities of Otomisi are located in such areas but precautions are still necessary. These settlements are more like workplaces than homes and most of the population are permanent residents, working in support industries or the chemical extraction, processing and research facilities. Without these facilities and their community of offworld workers, Otomisi's economy would collapse.

There is a small amount of industry on-planet but it is insufficient to supply the population. Mutterings about self-sufficiency are common from time-to-time, but it is simply more economical to import what is needed than investing in facilities to make it.

The unusual conditions on Otomisi have attracted the interest of the Scout Service, which maintains a research and training facility on-planet. This not only studies the conditions required for the notorious fogs and their effects on the local ecosystem but also conducts hostile-environment training for scouts regularly rotated through the base.
