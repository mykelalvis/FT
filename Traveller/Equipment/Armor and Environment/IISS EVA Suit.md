# IISS EVA Suit

The Scout Service EVA suit is a hardier, more well-equipped version of its standard vacc suit. The suit is designed to handle multiple challenging and hazardous working environments with improved heat and radiation shielding, internal grav-assist, precise handling and extended life support for up to 48 hours. The equipment consists of two components: the vacc suit itself, which may be worn in non-vacuum, standard-gravity environments; and the EVA rig which is a heavy, multi-purpose apparatus that the suit clips into.

The rig includes a set of waldos for sample collection and several sealed storage containers to store them in. Its advanced life-support gear is designed to make operating in the suit very comfortable. The suit closely monitors the occupant's vital signs and has internal injectors to provide first aid, anti-rad medicine and stimulants for long EVAs.
