Roet Bannerji is captain of the far trader Wolblutn. He is not very bright, is extremely careless, and has a tendency to panic in stressful situations, making his business career a series of misfortunes, although Bannerji usually blames his "bad luck", enemies unknown, or the unfairness of the universe. He thus considers himself justified in anything he does to anyone else - he's only evening the score. Bannerji's debts threatened to overwhelm him three years ago. and he started doing illegal jobs for [[Sternmetal Horizons]]; he is now employed full time in smuggling [[lanthanum]] for them.
