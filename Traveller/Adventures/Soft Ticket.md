# Players' Information

The PCs are hurriedly contacted by Henar Garrin, First Overseer (equivalent of a prime minister) to the Primarch of Erzan and asked to accept an emergency job that can't be entrusted to the usual channels. The beloved Primarch was recently — and quite suddenly — found dead of a heart condition. He has only one known heir, Secarch [[#Reni Maverra]] , who is unfortunately off-planet, having been granted permission by her father to attend a huge music festival in a neighboring system with [[#Reni's Friends|friends]].

Garrin presents two problems to the adventurers:

1. Planetary law dictates that after a ruler dies or abdicates, the next-in-line must take the throne within 21 days or lose the title.
2. A dangerously-radical anti-governmental movement is looking for just such a disruption to the line of succession to make a takeover move. To forestall this and buy time, the Erzani government must keep up appearances (the citizens haven't yet been told of the ruler's death) until Reni can be returned home.

This also requires Garrin to enlist outside aid: the heroes.  He offers them Cr50,000 to find Reni and return her to Erzan before time is up.

If the PCs don't have their own ship, a merchant ship can be loaned to them for the mission. Garrin also supplies the heroes with Reni's commcode and a recent hologram.

# Referee's Information

The festival is on the planet Taris( #TODO ), one parsec away. If the heroes must borrow a ship, it won't be a top-of-the-line vessel. The Referee should introduce whatever quirks (s)he likes to make the PCs sweat a little. Regardless, the ship is expected to be returned in reasonably good condition.

Garrin has no idea of the true scope of the threat. The organization, the Erzani People's Movement, wants to abolish the monarchy and establish a democracy (despite the Primarch's popularity.) To aid them in the effort, the movement has placed several agents high up in the planetary court. The leader of the malcontents is a lower minister in the government who, through a network of agents embedded in the court, supervises a carefully-planned campaign of sabotage, terrorism, and even assassinations designed to topple the monarchy. While the EPM wasn't responsible for the Primarch's death, they've of course become aware of the coming turmoil and are scrambling to take advantage of it. Despite Garrin's care, word reaches this individual of the Primarch's death; he in turn has dispatched teams of agents to prevent the Secarch's return to Erzan.

The heroes are on a tight schedule. Assuming a day each way from the respective systems' jump points and a week in jump both ways, the group has only five days to locate Reni and return her to Erzan. The problem is that the festival venue is huge (think Woodstock meets Burning Man, but many times larger) and taking place on the outskirts of a large Tarisian city. In fact, much like Burning Man, a temporary city has sprung up, with denizens sleeping in tents and prefab shelters by night and venturing forth to attend another musical venue by day. The population of the ephemeral town is well over 750,000, with hundreds of musical venues scattered throughout.

The map represents the festival venue as an abstraction, with areas of major acts numbered 11 through 66 (D66.)
Distances aren't represented, just the relation of acts to one another. The acts shown are major acts; none are detailed; the Referee is free to establish this information. Legitimate entrance to the festival is through [[#The Map|Area A]] (Cr10 admission.) Upon entry, each patron is issued a colored electronic wristband that changes color to black if they leave the venue or if they're otherwise considered unwelcome. Reentry upon voluntarily leaving requires repayment of admission.

Obviously, [[#festival security]] is on the lookout for black or missing wristbands and prepared to act accordingly. Area B is the venue's administrative area, including first aid, logistics, and security.

The festival is considered law level A for purposes of weapons use.

When the adventurers' arrive, the Referee should determine two things:

- The current time of day. Throw 1D6 and multiply the result by 400 to get the time, from 0000 to 2400.
- The current location of Reni and her friends.

Throw D66 and refer to the map or choose an area.

From this point, the PCs and Reni move through different areas as the youths take in the music and the PCs conduct a desperate search. However, the PCs won't necessarily know they're at the same musical venue as Reni unless they actively search. If the heroes try her comm, there's only a 1 in 6 chance she has it on. If so, she won't believe them (remember, she doesn't know them), and considers anything they say a cruel prank.

Searching each area takes time. The Referee should divide each day into six periods, with each period ending at 0800, 1200, 1600, 2000, 2400, and 0400 (240 minutes each.) The youths are active from 0800 to 1600, moving from area to area randomly as determined by the direction hex indicated on the map (throw 1D6 to determine what direction they move in during a period.) They're inactive from 1600 to 0800 for rest and meals. The PCs can move during any period they like, but must take at least one in six to rest, thereby becoming inactive themselves. Failure to do so imposes one point of damage for every two rest periods skipped.

Searching a hex takes 120 minutes, subject to relevant modifiers below.

Each time the PCs enter an area, they must make two throws:

- 7+ to locate Reni (if she happens to be in the same hex), using the following modifiers:
  - Current crowd density ±1D6–3
  - Hasty search (20 minutes) –1
  - Thorough search (240 minutes) +
  - Using electronic aids +1
- A 2D6 throw on the [[#Encounter Table]]

Once Reni is found, the team must find some way to convince her their mission is in earnest and that she should accompany them back to Erzan. They must also fight off one last attempt by the agents to prevent the effort, even if it means killing the young heir.
