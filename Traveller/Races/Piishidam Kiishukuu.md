The Piishidam Kiishukuu are genetically an offshoot of the Vilani, from a group which explored and ultimately settled within parts of the Vargr Extents during the First Imperium. They come from a society the Vargr call the “Dhoerrkaenfaek” (“Not worth the trouble”) but they call themselves “Piishidam Kiishukuu” which means “Void Travelling People”. The Piishidam Kiishukuu live on board ships which group together and travel in fleets for safety; occasionally a ship may leave its fleet to pursue some activity, rejoining the same or another fleet at a later date. Crews of most of the smaller ships tend to be members of an extended family; the Piishidam Kiishukuu have strict rules against marrying within your own crew in order to prevent inbreeding. When ships join a fleet it is common for members to seek partners from other clans who are present.

The Piishidam Kiishukuu have physically diverged slightly from their ancestors. They tend to be smaller, and are almost completely hairless. Their facial structure differs from that of current day Vilani. They are still clearly of human stock however and are able to interbreed with other Humans.

Though their own technical base is moderate, the Piishidam Kiishukuu are far less conservative than their ancestors and have become quite ingenious in finding ways to cobble together tech sourced from other societies. By long-standing tradition (from an earlier, lower tech stage in their history) they have a liking for solar sail designs, and have refined this technology and developed it in ways different to most other spacefaring cultures. Their ships deploy sails which absorb solar radiation and use it to charge capacitors which then provide the energy to activate the jump drive. This works, albeit being somewhat inefficient and requiring a charge up time of several weeks. The approach hasn't really caught on elsewhere but the Piishidam Kiishukuu have a real affection for the technology as a defining part of their culture. For them, spending several weeks drifting and observing the universe while their ships charge for another jump has an almost spiritual aspect.

Another common characteristic of Piishidam Kiishukuu ships is multiple redundancy. Ships may have a main jump drive and a backup one for use in case of malfunction. Again, this is a traditional approach born of many sad examples of ships which haven't made it back after suffering a mishap. Since their ships require no fuel storage, they usually have room available to carry spares of certain essential systems.

The Piishidam Kiishukuu use their own language, a dialect based on Old High Vilani with a lot of loan words from other cultures and a modified alphabet which is at least partly influenced by Anglic. Piishidam Kiishukuu ships are typically marked externally with numbers, not names. The ship found as a floating derelict and subsequently named "Annic Nova" was originally named
“Duukhumzi imgiu khimluukshaa” which means “Drifts majestically within the great void”. The letters which seem to spell "Annic Nova" are in fact the designation numbers of the Pinnaces on which they are stencilled.

Peaceful by nature, the Piishidam Kiishukuu keep to themselves, occasionally trading in systems they pass through. Their normal trade goods are nick-nacks, craft objects and refined metals collected during asteroid mining operations. Though insular and wary of outsiders, the Piishidam Kiishukuu actively try to avoid harming other people. To allow others to come to harm because of one's actions is seen as being almost as bad as harming them on purpose.
