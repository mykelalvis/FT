# Referee’s Overview

The team is hired by a noble to find and rescue his daughter, who has run away to join a cult. The cult has been spotted in and around Startown, growing in numbers and deadliness. The team tracks the sect to nearby mountains, where they not only find the noble’s daughter, but makes an astonishing discovery: the actual master of the cult is an artificial intelli gence.

# Players’ Information

His Lordship Count Yoshiro du Saint-Grave can barely keep his composure as he briefs the adventurers on the situation he and the Countess du Saint-Grave, eyes red from crying, are facing. Their only daughter and heir to their house, Lady [[#Naoko]], ran off with a cult calling itself the [[#AI|Peripheral]]. They hired an expert in cults to infiltrate the organization and rescue her, but they haven’t heard from him in weeks. The Count then made a mistake: he sent in his private troops to recover Naoko by force, but the cult anticipated their arrival and simply moved to a more secretive location. 

The Count’s patience and the Countess’ hope are at an end. He believes the PCs — a small, mobile party — can succeed where the troops failed; he offers the party Cr100,000 to track down and recover [[#Naoko]], with a 50% bonus if they destroy the cult. The sole stipulation is that Naoko is not to be harmed in any way.

# Referee’s Information

The heroes have little to go on: just [[#Naoko]]’s holopic and the sect’s last known location: a warehouse in a particularly-rough section of Startown. The warehouse is now empty, but there are signs of recent activity. If the team investigates the warehouse, they might pick up a clue as to the cult’s whereabouts on Recon 14+. If successful, throw on [[#Clue|the accompanying table]].
In addition, while they’re in the area, each PC can throw SOC 10+ to pick up a rumor. If successful, throw on the [[#Rumor]] table below.

However, at least once during their investigation, there’s a chance the team could attract unwanted attention: 1D+3 Peripheral [[#Cultist]]s who’ve been stationed to catch anyone nosing into their affairs attack the group with blade weapons. However, defeating the cultists gains the heroes nothing, as each one literally dies upon defeat, even if the heroes spare them. Adventurers with Medical skill who examine the bodies finds tiny computer implants in their brain stems. The devices are now inoperative, but if extracted (requires minor surgery) and analyzed, the team discovers they’re very sophisticated, able to send and receive data, temporarily boost physical capabilities, and “switch off” the user upon capture. PCs with Electronics, Comms, or Computer skill might be able to retrieve telemetry information from the devices. If so, they discover the signal came from a point in the Wintermist Mountains, 50 km away. 

The sect is currently occupying a plush villa in the Wintermist Mountains, purchased by Lady [[#Naoko]] for the cult’s benefit. From outside, nothing appears amiss; there aren’t even armed guards. Regardless, the area is monitored: newly-installed surveillance cameras tied to an alarm system watch the grounds and six [[#robodog]]s respond to intruders, backed up if necessary by cultists similar to the ones the PCs fought in Startown. There are 5D6 [[#Cultist|cult members]] in the villa at any given time; Naoko herself is present on 8+, and Highmaster [[#Gideon]] Rayne is present on 10+. On any given day, however, on a throw of a natural 2 (“snake eyes”), the cult has a full gathering; all 150 members are present, including [[#Naoko]] and [[#Gideon|Rayne]]. One of these members is the infiltrator the Count originally sent after Naoko. 

The gathering place is a small cave system below the main house (the rea son the villa was bought in the first place). Within the largest cave is hidden the cult’s true master. Several months ago, the Peripherals were taken over by an artificial intelligence that had not long before “escaped” the computer lab that was conducting studies on it after it learned that Rayne was secretly the leader of a techno-cult. It then learned how to subvert Rayne’s neural jack and used him to kill his research team when they tried to interfere. Since then, it’s learned to “infect” its human dupes by the implantation of computer hardware (of its own design; mimics the effects of Combat Drug (CE), but can also download tactical information with the user, thus sharing its Tactics skill level, and even kill the user by remote command.) that are implanted upon induction. It’s ultimate goal is a mystery to the humans.

The team must destroy the AI; simply trying to shut it down gives it a chance to download itself elsewhere via an encrypted link. It’s possible to enter cyber-combat with the device, but its INT and reaction time might make this dangerous to any except true computer masters with advanced equipment. 

If the PCs succeed, the cultists are disoriented, but otherwise unharmed; this should indicate to the PCs that their actions weren’t fully their choice. The PCs then face a dilemma: destroy a roomful of innocent men and women to collect Count du Saint-Grave’s bounty, or leave them alive and risk his wrath.
