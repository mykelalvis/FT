# GARDA-VILIS

Garda-Vilis was originally named _Tanoose_ when it was settled in -121 but the colony ran into problems which became steadily worse until the situation could at best be described as disastrous. The government of the nearby world of [[Vilis]] came to the rescue and bailed out the failing colony, at the price of becoming a possession of [[Vilis]]. The world's name was changed to Garda-Vilis, which means 'New Vilis' in one of the local dialects.

Ever since, Garda-Vilis has been exploited to the benefit of nearby [[Vilis]]. Agriculture was encouraged but heavy industry kept under strict control. Today, all major industrial operations are owned by [[Vilis]], keeping the colony economically dependent.

The world itself is large, with a tainted atmosphere and extensive ocean coverage. This still leaves plenty of room for the populace, numbering somewhat more than 470 million. The majority dwell on the world's largest continent, mostly around the coasts.

The major population center and capital has grown up around the world's large downport, which also serves a small Imperial scout base. The latter is important as a communications link back into the [[Imperium]] via [[Frenzie]], [[Denotam]], and thereby into [[Lanth Subsector]], and as a base of operations for [[Scout Service]] vessels in the region.

The government of Garda-Vilis takes the form of administrative apparatus answering to [[Vilis]] itself. The world is run by a council of Vilis army officers and this is not popular. A rebellion in [[IY1103]] was put down by the council, at the cost of what remaining public sympathy the colonial administration still had. Today the only pro-government group on Vilis is the population dwelling in and around the capital, as many of these individuals are employed by the starport or its associated industries.

There is a [[Tanoose Freedom League|strong independence movement]] on Garda-Vilis, calling itself the TFL.
