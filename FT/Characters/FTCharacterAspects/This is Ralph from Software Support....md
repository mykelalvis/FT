`{RELATIONSHIP_ASPECT}` - Yeah, I did  a bunch of application work, support, and help desk duty for  a company that sold software to lawyers and law firms when I first got coreward. Customer Management Systems, Contract Mangement Systems, Legal reference systems.. plus I had to be the only person on the help desk for a  about 6 months.. * (Helped Gerbald Tedworth with Law Management Software?)
