A Highport is the orbital or deep space component of a [[Starport]].

Frequently found on larger [[starport]]s, the highport coordinates activity with the [[downport]] or ground component of the [[starport]]. Not every [[starport]] will have a highport.

Any [[starport]] that lacks a highport will only be able to accommodate craft capable of atmospheric flight and landing. Since many craft lack this capability, it will limit traffic. On the other hand, many space and starcraft carry landers for just such a reason.

## History & Background

_Highports_ often bring new economic traffic and opportunities to a system, but also require considerable cost (upkeep) for maintenance, upgrades and expansion.  _Highports_ requires considerable technical skills to operate and maintain. Staff must be trained in Zero-G operations as well as engineering under vacuum conditions.

For many species, there are a number of health considerations required to live in artificial environments located in a vacuum such as low-gravity-related maladies, breathing mediums, climate control, food production or importation, and many other factors.

## Worlds & Sectors

**Highports** are located on many worlds with strategic, economic, or worlds of other important value.
