### Sharurshid

The third of the Vilani Bureaus, Sharurshid was founded by the
merchant caste and became a trading rather than manufacturing
concern. To this day Sharurshid produces little but makes a vast
amount of money buying and selling other firms' produce. In
particular Sharurshid is famous for luxury goods, a sector where it
competes vigorously with Makhidkarun.

Sharurshid operates a large fleet of trade ships, many of them plying
longâ€“distance routes to bring rare goods to the markets of the core
worlds. The firm also operates brokerages on many starports,
helping others make a profit for a modest percentage.

Sharurshid has few physical installations other than its offices and
starships; it simply does not need them. If facilities are necessary
then these can be leased for whatever term is required. Similarly,
Sharurshid is less interested in making investments than in trade.
Where, say, Hortalez et Cie will invest in a new manufacturing
facility, Sharurshid is more likely to buy its products and sell them
elsewhere.


Sharurshid is primarily a shipping operator, although it uses these vessels to facilitate trade in a vast array of goods. Sharurshid is a constant voice for restraint in Deneb and has been known to apply economic pressure to those dukes who allow piracy and disruption of trade to interfere with business. Most of Sharurshid's vessels are large freighters, plying the lanes right across the sector from one border to the other. It does not favor any candidates for sector duke but does lobby for the appointment of one, as a more unified sector would mean more stable trading conditions. Sharurshid has a major regional office at Deneb, although few of its ships travel there.
