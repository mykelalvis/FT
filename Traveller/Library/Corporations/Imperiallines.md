Imperiallines is a shipping firm owned by the [[Imperium|Imperial]] family. It mainly serves the major routes, but vessels are sometimes encountered on minor or “feeder” routes and have a number of contracts to the Imperial military and political services. As a result its ships can be encountered even in backwater systems carrying ambassadors, resupplying military installations or carrying out government–related tasks. Imperiallines vessels are very secure and of high quality. Imperiallines is not a Megacorporation but recent growth suggests that it will soon achieve that status.

Most [[Class C Starport]] or better in the [[Spinward Marches]] are served by Imperiallines.

lmperiallines ships are not named; they carry only numbers.

lmperiallines never hires personnel who are not lmperiallines-trained except as low-leve| office workers.

lmperiallines maintains facilities on all worlds in the [[Aramis subsector]] with class C starports [[Violante]], [[Pysadi]].[[Reacher]].[[Patinir]], [[Carsten]], [[Dhian]], [[Feneteman]], [[Yebab]], and [[Jesedipere]], as well as a terminal on [[Traveller/Locations/Sectors/Spinward Marches Sector Systems/Aramis Subsector Systems/Aramis|Aramis]]. Subsector headquarters is on [[Dhian]].

### Frontier Transport (type TI)

Using a 2000-ton hull, the frontier transport is a cargo-carrying freighter employed to serve worlds off the main trade routes, it mounts jump driveV, maneuver drive-V, and power plant V, giving a performance of jump-2 and 2G acceleration. Fuel tankage for 440 tons supports the power plant and one jump-2. Adjacent to the bridge is a computer Modellﬁ. There are 21 staterooms and 10 low berths. The ship has 10 hardpoints and 10 tons of fire control allocated. Installed on the hardpoints are 10 triple turrets, each mounting three beam lasers. There is one ship's vehicle: a 95-ton shuttle. Cargo capacity is 1114 tons (not including a potential 70 tons aboard the shuttle in its cargo bay). The hull is streamlined.

The frontier transport requires a crew of 21: captainlpilot, navigator, medic, shuttle pilot, 7 engineers, and '10 gunners. The ship does not normally carry passengers. The ship costs MCr736.2 (including a 1% architect's fee, and a 10% diecount for volume production), and takes 32 months to build.

lmperiallines serves a great many worlds in the [[Imperium]], but most are off the main trade routes. Their frontier transport provides the basic shippin needs to serve such worlds. The high cargo capacity and the elementary

### Referee'e Note

The following information is not contained in the March Harriers computer and is not public knowledge.

Although it engages in real trade, the company's primary purpose is to provide a covert transport and courier system for the imperial government.  lmperiallines uses two outwardly identical ship types: type Tl, capable of iump~2, and the secret type TJ, capable of jump-6.

### Frontier Transport (type TJ)

Using a 2000-ton hull, the frontier transport is a cargo carrying freighter employed to serve worlds off the main trade routes. It mounts jump drive-Z, maneuver drive-Z, and power plant-Z, giving a performance of jump-6 and 6G acceleration. Fuel tankage for 1320 tons supports the power plant, and allows one jump-6. Adjacent to the bridge is a computer Model/ls. There are 21 staterooms and ten low berths. The ship has 10 hardpoints and 10 tons of fire control allocated. Installed on the hardpoints are ten triple turrets, each mounting three beam lasers. There is one ship's vehicle: a 95 ton shuttle. Cargo performance specs make the ship well-suited for its job, capacity is 194 tons (not including a potential 70 tons aboard the shuttle in its cargo bay). The hull is streamlined.

The frontier transport requires a crew of 21 : captain/pilot, navigator, medic, shuttle pilot, 7 engineers, and 10 gunners. The ship does not normally carry passengers. The ship costs MCrB16.2 (including a 1% architect's fee, and a 10% volume production discount) and takes 32 months to build.

Externally identical to the [[#Frontier Transport (type TI)]], the type TJ is never openly identified as such by its owners. The type TJ fulfills lmperiallines' major covert mission: to provide a jump-6 transport system within the [[Imperium]] for material, agents, information, and equipment necessary for various Imperial activities.

lmperiallines equipment is a grimy, dirty assemblage. Under the grime, the ships all look the same; no one gets close enough to see the differences between Ti and TJ types, and, as far as the public knows, all the ships are of the TI type.

lmperiallines is a front. It would take a lot of work to see, but through several interlocking companies and hoiders, ownership finally goes back to an office in the Imperial Household bureaucracy, lmperiallines is a fast-moving secret imperial courier.

The TI's keep up the charede that the company is a tramp freight transporter. Under various names and using various different ship designs, all with the same specifications, the company has offices in two out of three class C starport worlds in the [[Imperium]]. In addition, the company has offices at subsector capitals in many sectors, and calls frequently with goods for many imperial bases, lmperiallines is the name used in the Spinwerd Marches.

Standard practice for lmperiallines is to run unscheduled trips. The ship stands ready until its cargo bays are filled, and it then takes off for the next world on its list. Since no one is to say whether the ship is full or not, there is no stopping its leaving. No passengers means fewer restrictions on travel. The short-legged ships handle the cargo hauling; the fast ships do the actual courier“ work.

Supposedly, each lmperiallines facility has two ships assigned to it, and they regularly return to that base. Actually, each facility has one jump-2 ship which works out of the base; the jump-6 ships have no permanent home, and instead move from place to place as their missions call for it.
