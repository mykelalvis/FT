# TRIN

Colonized not long after [[Mora]], Trin is the 'back door to [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]]'. It can be reached from Deneb by an easy jump-2 route through well-developed worlds, with good ports in the Gulf subsector. This creates a lucrative trade run into Trin, from where it is possible to head coreward and join the Spinward Main or spinward towards Glisten.  Large quantities of goods move through Trin's excellent highport, which has many brokerages and commercial dispute resolution firms. Most ships are larger types; corporate freighters and liners rather than small, privately-owned ships but Trin's shipyards are used for refits by many smaller operators - at least, those who can afford the fees.

Trin Highport also hosts a very large independent merchant academy, the Imperial Trin Institute of Commerce (ITIC). ITIC trains merchant spacer crews but also offers courses in related areas such as brokerage and business law. Many of the personnel on the 'spacer'
side of the institute also undertake Naval Reservist training at the Imperial Navy base in the system.

This serves as headquarters for the subsector fleet and a base for heavy squadrons of the Sector Fleet.
Trin's system defences are commanded from a ground installation on Trin itself but many of the system defence vessels berth at the naval base. Trin also has a small scout base to serve the communications network.

There is one other major facility in the Trin system, the world of Ling Standard Products Spinward, named for the corporate facility built on it in the early years of corporate expansion into the area. Originally planned to take over as regional headquarters from the facility at Mora, it instead became a manufacturing site with a side line in researching improved industrial techniques.

Trin itself is a medium-sized world with a dense, tainted atmosphere and low water coverage. There are no moons, although Trin had one in the past. The cloud of reflective debris that makes dawn and sunset so spectacular on Trin is the remnant of this satellite, which broke up due to gravitational stresses.

The world's population numbers in the tens of billions.  As with many high population worlds, Trin's people are concentrated in very large cities surrounded by agricultural areas. Even with such a large population, there is plenty of land and well-regulated agriculture, using high-technology methods, is capable of feeding Trin's billions without resorting to bulk food imports or low-quality subsistence rations. Indeed, Trin is a strong contender for one of the best places to live in Charted Space; the cities are not crowded and very well-designed by a civilization that has had gravitic transportation since the world was colonized. Buildings are characteristically tall, with wide spaces between them filled with parks and recreation facilities. Most Trin residents are used to thinking in three dimensions when getting about, the idea of being stuck at ground level is foreign to them.

Ground vehicles are not common on Trin, other than for industrial and agricultural use, and mobility within large buildings. Getting around in the city involves fast, efficient maglev trains or grav buses floating between landing areas on the exterior of buildings. Maglev rail lines link the cities, along with high-speed grav vehicles.

The general populace are well educated and enjoy a very high quality of life. Upward mobility is available through promotions at work but for those of a different bent it is possible to obtain government sponsorship (equivalent to an appropriate salary) for excellence or promise in areas as diverse as art, writing, music and sport. There are poor people on Trin, of course, but there is a highly effective social safety net, which is normally sufficient to allow anyone who has fallen on hard times to start climbing back to prosperity. Being flat broke on Trin is not quite the same as being down and out on some frontier world or mid-tech industrial hellhole.

Trin's effective and efficient social system tends to produce motivated and skilled people. Coupled with a Tech Level as high as anywhere in the [[Imperium]], this has made Trin an industrial powerhouse whose goods are exported across the sector and far beyond. That in turn generates a level of wealth only dreamed of on many worlds.

Trin's government is typical of high-population worlds, in that it has a semi-corporate, bureaucratic structure that follows established practices. Stability is considered the priority in most areas of governance - Trin is so far ahead of the pack that reckless growth is undesirable and carries a risk of damaging the world's enviable position as one of the best and richest places to live this side of the Imperial Core. Trin has it good and prefers to play safe to ensure things stay that way.

However, Trin is an economic center and her government understands that flexibility and rapid responses are necessary for success in commerce. Calculated risks are acceptable, so long as there is always enough in reserve to cover a loss and nothing is ventured that cannot be done without. Cautious speculation is the order of the day in the economic arena and other areas too, such as scientific research.

This innate caution has, oddly enough, prompted the government of Trin to invest in some very unlikely scientific projects, economic investments and exploratory missions. If there is a risk that someone else might make a big score from a project that Trin might miss, then the government is willing to invest, just in case it pays off. This attitude puzzles some outsiders but it makes sense to those who grew up on Trin. They explain that: 'When you're rich, you can afford to throw a little money into blue-sky projects. If it's a bust, nothing is really lost. But once in a while you get lucky.'
