Introduction
Welcome to the universe of Traveller! In the distant future, when humanity has made the leap to the stars, interstellar
travel will be as common as international travel is today. Traveller is set against that background drawn from adventure
oriented science fiction. The scope and breadth of this game are limited only by the imagination and skill of the players and
their referee. Traveller is an entire universe to be explored, where almost any situation which occurs in a science fiction
novel, movie, or short story can be recreated with only a little work on the part of the referee.
Traveller postulates that mankind has conquered the stars, and that travel from one stellar system to another is commonplace.
However, the tremendous distances involved dictate that interstellar voyages can take weeks, months, and sometimes
even years. A situation similar to Earth in the eighteenth century is created, where communication is limited to the speed of
travel, and the stage is set for adventure in a grand fashion, with all the trappings of classic science fiction: giant, starspanning
empires (good, evil, or both), huge starfleets, wily interstellar merchants (or pirates, depending upon your point of
view), complex d iplomatic maneuvers, larger-than-life heroes, heroines, and villa ins.
The Character: Into the midst of all this is thrust the player, whose alter-ego in the universe of Traveller (the character)
interacts with the referee (who administers and, in many cases, creates the details of the universe) in an informal session of
role-playing called an adventure. The attributes of the player's alternate persona are numbers generated by rolling dice, and
these characteristics aid the referee in determining how successful characters may be in achieving whatever goal is set for
them.
Traveller is open-ended, which means that there are no set conditions for winning. Each player sets his or her own goal,
and has a lifetime (in game terms) to achieve it. Traveller can continue for as long as the referee and the players desire. Like
the universe, Traveller has no limits.
This book contains all rules needed to play Traveller, plus enough introductory background material and scenarios to
permit even beginners to start playing as soon as possible. Subsequent books in this series will expand upon various segments
of the Traveller universe, treating certain selected areas in more detail. But this book contains all the rules you will need to
play. Everything else is supplementary.
ADVENTURING IN TRAVELLER
Traveller is a set of detailed rules covering how the
universe operates. These rules govern day-to-day activities
to be expected for any individual. Against this background
of basic information, players can work, earn money, travel
to distant worlds, and lead exciting lives of daring and
adventure.
But Traveller does much more. The characters have an
opportunity to undertake genuine adventures as they search
for their own self-appointed goals. Some adventures happen
as a result of day-to-day activity. Some occur as players
use pre-written adventures. This book includes two detailed
adventures ready to play. One investigates an alien structure,
and the players must solve its mystery if they intend
to leave the world alive. The other pits the adventuring
group against an impersonal bureaucracy: if the captain is
to keep his ship, the players must all work together to
convince petty bureaucrats to grant them an exit visa.
Most Traveller adventures come from the referee's own
imagination. Each new world is an opportunity for the
referee to present a new situation to the players, who must
cope with this scenario if they are to progress in their own
adventures.
GETTING YOUR FEET WET
Since the Traveller approach is role-playing, players and
referees experienced in other role-playing games should
have little trouble. There are, however, a number of features
which make Traveller unique among role-playing games:
The Character Generation System: Unlike most other
role-playing games, Traveller does not simply dump inexperienced
18-year-olds into the world and let them fend
for themselves. In Traveller it is possible for a character to
gain experience for up to 28 years in one of the six prior
services (army, navy, marines, scouts, merchants, and the
nebulous other). In practical terms, this means a band of
adventurers will not consist entirely of striplings. Some may
be inexperienced, but there will also be characters from all
levels of experience, and from all walks of life. A character
has a past and can be more than just a series of numbers on
,.

Introduction
a sheet of paper. A character picks up skills (like computer
programming or navigation) during prior service, more
being accumulated the longer the time served, but there are
a number of trade-offs to be made. The longer the service
career, the more skills acquired, but also the older the char·
acter becomes, losing dexterity. endurance, and strength.
Animals and Animal Encounters: The various lifeforms
which players are likely to encounter on their voyages
through the cosmos are described not in terms of physical
characteristics (lionoid, bear-like, pseudowolf, etc) but in
terms of their size, behavior, and the ecological niche which
they fill on their particular world. Physical descriptions
are also possible, but this ecological system is a universal
approach that deals with relatively constant essentials of
animal life.
Flexibility: The basic rules of Traveller contained in this
book are flexible enough to allow almost any science
fiction theme to be recreated without significantly disturbing
the balance of play. The basic rules deal only with
the major aspects of the way the universe works, allowing
the referee to fashion details to suit individual preferences.
The technological levels of the various cultures players will
contact in the course of play can be set at any level desired
from the primeval past (tech level 0) through present day
Earth (about tech level 7.5) to the barely conceivable
wonders of the distant future.
Referees can adjust the complexities of their universes to
their own and their players' abilities, gradually moving
upward in complexity as more expertise with the various
systems is gained. Playing Traveller can be a challenge to all
ages, all intellects, and all levels of role-playing experience.
Economics: A detailed but simple system allows the
intricacies of interplanetary and interstellar trade to be
represented, without dominating the referee's attention.
Trade and commerce can be accomplished with a few rolls
of the dice, and the system is simple enough to allow
players to handle most of it if the referee desires. With
minimal exertion, players can attempt to establish mighty
Game Designers' Workshop
trading corporations, spanning many star systems, or simply
ply the space-lanes with a single decrepit free trader,
desperately trying to keep one step ahead of their creditors
while dreaming of that deal to end all deals.
The Combat System: Naturally, not everyone (or
everything) the players meet will be friendly, and it will
occasionally be necessary for some characters to resort
to violence. Traveller's combat rules allow for fights ranging
from simple bare-knuckles fisticuffs to engagements be·
tween starfleets, and everything in between (including
combat with animals). Every personal weapon from broken
bottles to energy weapons is taken into account.
Psionics: Traveller includes a section covering psionic
abilities for those who feel that no game is complete
without a sixth (or seventh) sense. Clairvoyance, telekinesis,
telepathy, and other abilities are defined, regulated, and
smoothly integrated into the game rules.
Starship Construction: Referees and players can design
and build spacecraft ranging in size from one-passenger
fighter craft to giant starships, both military and civilian.
The design and construction sequence is a game in itself,
as the designer tries to fit every component considered
necessary into a hull that always seems too small. The
struggle to make an effective ship that is also efficient
seems never-ending.
REQUIRED MATERIALS
This book contains all the rules necessary to begin
playing Traveller. The rules provide for solitaire and un·
supervised play, but the highest form of the game, the
one that is most fun, requires that someone act as referee.
Traditionally, this person is the one most familiar with the
rules. Indeed, the players need not know the rules at all in
order to play, but enjoyment will be enhanced if everyone
knows a little about what is going on. An independent,
non-involved referee allows a degree of flexibility and
continuity not possible when the players themselves control
the game. A referee inserts a measure of uncertainty into
the minds of the players as they play. Finally, a referee
deais with situations that the rules may not cover; after all
no set of rules can totally define the universe and how it
works.
Traveller is a conversational game, and as such has no
board or playing surface, but it does require certain materials
in order to play. The referee will need this book, a
number of six-sided dice (two per player, plus a few extra),
writing instruments (pencils, pens, colored markers, and so
on) and paper (scratch paper for lists and computations,
graph paper for diagrams, and other types such as index
cards or tracing paper).
Forms: Scattered throughout several chapters are various
prepared forms. One is used to record the specifics of
a character; another records data about a starship. The
forms provided are intended for use by the referee and
the players as they generate information during the game.
They have been printed on the page to allow maximum
ease of reproduction, such as photocopying. Once two
copies have been made, they can be positioned side by side
on the photocopier and multiple copies can be run off.
Using These Materials: The exact use of all these rna-

The Traveller Book
terials will be explained later in this book, since the course
each individual game takes will determine what materials
are needed.
The most important requirement, however, is imagination.
Without imagination, Traveller is simply a dull,
tedious routine of rolling dice and reading tables. With
it, Traveller can be a vehicle to carry you to the limits
of the universe.
DEFINITIONS OF TERMS
Traveller uses certain words and abbreviations in a
unique manner, and in order to be able to properly understand
the Traveller rules, players and referees should
acquire some familiarity with these terms.
The following words, phrases and abbreviations are
commonly used in Traveller:
Character. The fictional role played in Traveller. Player
characters are manipulated by the players; non-player
characters are manipulated by the referee.
Credit (abbreviated Cr). The monetary unit in Traveller.
For very large amounts of money, the megacredit (abbreviated
MCr) represents one million credits.
Die (plural is dice). A random number generator. In
order to make events relatively unpredictable by the
players, events are often given probabilities of occurring.
Dice are used to generate random numbers that represent
these probabilities.
Die Roll (also Die Throw). The actual use of dice to
create a random number.
Die Modifier (abbreviated OM). A number added to or
subtracted from the die roll to obtain a modified result.
OMs represent efforts to change probabilities in favor of
or against some result. Characters may be allowed beneficial
OMs because they have requisite skills, or they may be
penalized by negative OMs because they lack strength or
intelligence.
Encounter. The meeting of one or more characters and
one or more persons, things, or events. Encounters may or
may not result in significant interaction with player characters.
An encounter with a clerk in a store is not likely to be
of great importance, and it may not even be mentioned to
the players. An encounter with a band of cut-throats late at
night or a pack of wild animals could permanently affect
the characters, and is dealt with in detail. A large part of a
referee's job is the administration of encounters.
Jump. A trip from one point in space to another using
jump drives, at greater than the speed of light. A jump is
made by leaving the universe of the game and travelling
through a different plane of existence (called jump space in
Traveller, but often referred to as hyper-space or tau-space
in science fiction literature).
Non-Starship. A spaceship without a jump drive, and
thus incapable of interstellar travel on its own.
Patron. A non-player character used by the referee to
create an encounter for player characters. Patrons are
usually used to motivate players to move in a direction
more fully in tune with the wishes of the referee, or to
provide income or diversion for player characters.
Referee. An individual who creates and administers a
hypothetical universe, and adjudicates conflicts between
Introduction
the players and other inhabitants or forces within that
universe.
Skill. An ability to perform a set action, such as navigating
a starship, operating a rifle, or programming a computer.
Skills are attained in levels (navigation-1, computer-
2, etc); the higher the level of a skill, the more expertise
a character has in that area. Many different individual skills
are available to characters.
Starport. A facility for the service of interstellar and
interplanetary vessels of all sorts, and for embarkation and
disembarkation of passengers and cargo.
Travellers' Aid Society. A private interstellar organization
which maintains hostels and facilities at various starports
throughout our Traveller universe.
World. Any inhabited body. A world could be a planet
like Earth, a satellite of a planet, an airless planet with
domed or underground cities, a hollowed-out planetoid,
an artificial construct such as a space station or L-5
type colony, or a more complex artifact such as a ringworld
or rosette.
Universe. The totality of existence for the player charac·
ters, the mythos, the informational background created by
a referee. In Traveller, universe refers to the game "reality"
in which the characters controlled by the players interact
with the various characters and forces controlled by the
referee.
PROCEDURES
To a certain extent, Traveller is a contest between the
referee and the players, as the referee represents all the
nasty things that the universe can throw at people. As such,
it is very easy for a referee to come to view the players as
"the enemy", whose every move is to be thwarted, and to
take every opportunity to make things tough on the players,
throwing problem after problem their way and piling
disaster on top of disaster. This makes the players sullen
and suspicious, and spoils the entertainment value of
Traveller. A referee's fun in Traveller is different from a
player's fun. While players plot and scheme on the basis of
(often) incomplete data, the referee sees all and knows all.

Introduction
Observing the reactions of different people to the same
problem, or watching an intricate plan unfold (and often
turn out quite differently from what the players had intended)
; these and more are Traveller's rewards for the referee.
To begin, start out small, especially if you are also new
to Traveller. Don't try to run something of breathtaking
scope the first time out; the record-keeping alone will
overwhelm you and your players will rapidly lose interest.
First Approaches: There are several approaches to the
first few games; which one you choose depends on the
experience you and your players have had.
An experienced player refereeing other experienced
players for the first time will have few problems. Playing
experience will have shown where the pitfalls are, and the
referee probably has some idea of what is interesting.
If both players and referee are neophytes, neither really
knows what to do, and everyone should show patience.
Play a few scenarios before proceeding to a campaign. A
scenario is like a science fiction novel ; the players are given
some specific goal and the adventure occurs as they try to
attain it. Scenarios can be one-time affairs, ending when the
goal is achieved. Everyone quits and the characters are
discarded. Create a scenario as you would a story, with
something to be achieved and difficulties strewn in the path
of that goal. Scenarios can be as complex as the referee
feels necessary, ranging from the simplest plot devices to
complex adventures worthy of a great adventure writer. To
help the beginner get started, several introductory adventures
are included in this book.
In devising scenarios, you may f ind it necessary to create
from scratch such items as a plan of a large office bu ilding,
a terrain map of an area of countryside, or something
similar. If you are a wargamer, you may already have a
ready·made source of such items available to you. Maps
from many games can be adapted for use in a scenario,
especially games on a tactical level. It will probably be
necessary to re-designate some or all of the terrain features
on such a map. In addition, it may be possible for you to
draw inspiration from real life. If, for instance, your players
want to rob a bank and want a diagram of the building
from which to make their plans, simply tell them that the
bank looks exactly like some local bank or similar building
with which they are all familiar. Discourage them from
"casing the place" in person, however. The real -life security
guards might become suspicious, and real-life problems
could occur. Likewise, if you need a plan for an office
building, park, or other building complex, use some suitable
local institution, calling upon the players' memories or
diagramming it yourself. It you do not have knowledge of
the full details of a building, make up whatever is needed (it
may be necessary to change some details anyway, especially
if players are more familiar with the building than the
characters can be allowed to be).
After you have been through a few scenarios, your
players will find themselves becoming attached to certain
characters and expressing a desire to let them continue
from one scenario to another. A campaign need be nothing
more than a series of scenarios, set against a common
background and using common characters. After you have
played a few scenarios, determine what your playars want
Game DMigners' Workshop
to accomplish. Some groups will want to become pirates,
some soldiers of fortune, some merchants, some confidence
men, some will want to carve out their own empires, others
will want to explore unknown regions of space. Adjust the
subsector you create to fit your players' desires. If, for
instance they show an interest in exploration, don't start
them out in the middle of civilized space; put them on the
fringe of known territory. Give your players obstacles to
overcome in seeking their ultimate aims, but don't make
these obstacles too difficult or the players will become
frustrated. Conversely, don't make things too easy or they
will become bored.
The main thing for referees to avoid in starting out is
taking on more than they are able to handle. It is an easy
thing for a referee to be pushed into a campaign by anxious
players before he or she is properly prepared for it. Trying
to go too far too soon leads to a referee that feels overworked
and players that feel bored, a sure formula for an
abandoned game.
REFEREE RESPONSIBILITIES
The purpose of a referee is to present obstacles for
players to overcome as they go about seeking their goals,
not to constantly make trouble for them. This is a very
subtle distinction, and one which many beginners have
trouble with.
Attributes of a Good Referee: Other than the right
attitude, what characteristics must a good referee have?
First of all, imagination. Without an imaginative referee,
the game is merely rolling dice and reading' tables. Fortu·
nately, imagination is the one thing that science fiction
readers in general and Traveller players in particular have in
abundance.
Second, the ability to improvise. Oftentimes, situations
arise where the referee will be called upon to make up
something on the spot, such as the cargo of a randomly
encountered starship or the personality of a patron. The
necessity to improvise can be minimized with proper
planning and organization, but it cannot be eliminated
entirely.
Third, a sense of proportion is requ ired. Rewards should
be proportionate to the risk the player characters take,
neither too much nor too little. A common way beginners
maintain player interest is to hand out ludicrously large
rewards for successful completion of the most insignificant
actions. The players rapidly accumulate enormous sums of
money, and come to see it as their sole purpose in the
"lives" of their characters. In addit ion, they will rapidly
overwhelm Traveller's carefully balanced economic system.
Players will cease to f ind life a challenge, and become
bored. If the referee tries to get tough later, players will
demand to know why they are not paid as much now as
they were once paid for similar activities and will become
dissatisfied. Either way, the game is a loser. Arrange things
so that your players have to constantly scramble for eating
money for the first few months of their characters' "lives".
You and they will both enjoy the game more.
Lastly, it is important for the referee to be organized.
The reasons for this should be readily apparent. Nothing
slows a game down more than a referee who must rummage

The Traveller Book
through a briefcase filled with hundreds of random sized
sheets of paper while searching for the details of a particular
world or installation. The exact system is not important;
you may use whatever you feel like (manila folders, index
card f iles, ring notebooks, home computers, and so on) as
long as you can rapidly retrieve information from it.
Preliminary Steps: Once the referee has settled on the
background for his or her universe, accumulated a group of
players, and created characters, then what? The referee still
has a few duties to perform before the f irst adventure. In
all likelihood, the players will be dumped into the middle
of a new situation. If the adventure were "real life", the
people involved would know what they had done with their
lives up until that time, they would know where they were
and how they got there, and might have a halting famil iarity
with the geography of the region. It is necessary for the
referee to divide the information about his or her universe
into four parts: 1) information which player characters
would logically know by virtue of what they are, 2) information
which player characters can find out with little
or no cost, 3) information which player characters can find
out only at great cost, and 4) information which the
player characters would be unable to find out by their own
efforts.
Type 1 could be such things as how to behave in polite
society, or some simple data about a planet if the character
has navigation skill. Type 2 could be information obtained
from a library, from asking around at bars, hotel lobbies,
and so on, or obtained by direct observation of some event
or condition. Type 3 could be information that requires the
theft of one or more documents (payment in time) or the
bribery of some official (payment in money). Type 4
should be information about the true nature of reality,
perhaps the fact that the information contained in
the library is false with regard to the planet mentioned
above, or other information for the referee's
eyes only.
Players can generally be trusted to keep track of
their own characters' finances and possessions, which will
save the referee a great deal of time and trouble. Occasional
surprise audits, however, can be conducted to help keep
them honest.
The beginning referee should keep the group small, even
when he or she has had experience playing. There should be
no more than three or four people in the first group you
run. As you gain experience in refereeing, you will be able
to expand this number, but try not to allow it to get too
large for you to handle.
The rolling of dice is a convenient way to represent
unknown variables or to assist the referee in making decisions.
Feel free to modify the results if you do not like
the way they turned out. Change a death result to a severely
wounded result if you feel a character has behaved
heroically and deserves a second chance, or kill off one who
has done something incredibly dumb but lucked out on the
die roll. Be fair in doing this, however, and try not to be
too heavy-handed. Most players feel better if their character
is done in by the die roll than if killed by fiat.
The use of non-player characters is one of the most
important things for a referee to learn. Non-player charac-
Introduction
ters are the population of your universe other than the
characters controlled by your players. Through non-player
characters you can give the players rumors, hints, and
threats, help them out of tight spots, lure them into tight
spots, get them back on the track, lure them away from
their objective, and generally help or hinder the characters
as much as is necessary. Non-player characters provide a
major link between player characters and the referee and
offer the referee a chance to get in on the fun.
The referee plays the non-player character whenever one
of the player characters has contact with one of them.
Exactly how this is done depends to a great degree upon
the talents of the referee. Some referees are able to assume
a non-player character's personality and play the part to
13

Introduction
perfection, carrying out an actual conversation with the
player complete with accents, body language, gestures,
subtle variations in tone and pitch of voice, and so on.
less theatrically inclined referees, or those who cannot
think as fast, are rarely able to give such a performance, and
more often must describe what the non-player character is
saying and doing rather than perform it.
Non-Player Characters: There are four sorts of nonplayer
character: spear carrie rs, informants, patrons, and
trouble-makers. Spear carriers (called extras in the movies)
serve to provide atmosphere, needed skills the players might
not have, or cannon fodder (in case a referee wants to show
what great danger the players are in by killing someone but
does not want to do in one of the players). Informants
serve to give the players information, and are ideal for those
situations in which the referee needs to give false data, but
does not feel like lying to the players outright. Informants
may be experts the players consult (such as a university
professor or scholar). passengers or crew of a starship the
players are on, or people the players casually meet in the
course of seeking rumors or employment. A patron is a
non-player character who has a job offer for one or more of
the players. The patron provides some of the information
the players will need to carry out the job (rarely will all
information be provided; the players must find some things
out for themselves), and will offer a reward of some sort.
Trouble-makers are specifically intended to cause problems
for the characters. Trouble-makers include police, customs,
tax, and immigration officials, other government red-tapers,
thugs, ruffians, hijackers, thieves, con-men, religious fanatics,
and so on. The presence of trouble-makers may or
may not be immediately obvious to the players.
Many NPCs must have as detailed a character development
as player characters do, and should be given a great
deal of careful attention if they are intended to stay around
for a while. NPCs are often needed on the spur of the
moment; use the characters you generated while learning to
use the system.
Game Designers' Workshop
CONDUCT OF THE ADVENTURING SESSION
Sessions should be conducted in some relatively quiet,
comfortable place where there is room for the referee to lay
out his or her materials out of the direct vision of the
players, but close enough for conversation. If the quarters
are too close, it may be necessary for the referee to use a
screen of some sort (a passable screen can be made by
taping sheets of cardboard together, accordion-style) to
prevent the players from reading the referee's information
sheets.
Beginning: During the f irst adventuring session of a
campaign, or at the beginning of a scenario, take a moment
out to determine a little background data. Why are the
characters where they are, and why are they together?
Working out this background data will help the players get
into their roles. A close examination of the characters
themselves can often help with this. Are several of the
characters former navy personnel? Obviously they met in
the service and became friends, deciding to seek their
fortunes after they were all discharged on the same planet.
Perhaps the characters are distantly related, or have mutual
friends, or are old schoolchums. A little imagination can
come up with a reason why these people want to t ry a
group effort, and will give the players some clues to later
behavior.
When the background is sketched in, give the players
such information as they would logically have. Where are
the characters, and how did they get there? Are they
actively looking for work, or were they sought out? Is there
a patron involved? What are the characters in the players'
group supposed to do? What will be their payment if they
are successful? What do they need to find out to carry out
the task? What equipment is available? And so on.
Give the players a few minutes to talk the job offer over
and then ask them to decide their actions. One player
should be chosen to speak for the group as a whole. If the
group wants to split up and do different things, try to talk
them out of it unless a) one of the splinters will be carrying
out an action which will require little or no continuing
action on the part of the referee, such as research in a
library, b) the groups will rejoin quickly, or c) you have one
assistant referee available for each separate group of players.
Beginners will find keeping track of two or more lines of
action while running back and forth from one room to
another grueling and the players who are not with the
referee at the moment will become mightily bored.
When the player's initial actions are made clear to you,
(don't be afraid to ask questions) figure out what will
happen to them as a result of those actions. If, for example,
the group wishes to adjourn to a library to search for
information they want, the referee should consider where
they are and how long the trip will take. If they are hundreds
of kilometers from a settlement, it may take some
time just to get to the library. If they are in a hotel lobby
and there is a computer terminal ten meters away which
hooks into a planet-wide information grid, only a few
seconds will pass. How long it takes the group to find out
what they are after depends on what the information is
(they could not, for instance, use a library to find out the
specifications of the local prison's latest security procedures)

The Traveller Book
and how the players go about searching for it. It is easier to
find something out if you know a little about what you
seek, and know what to look for. The referee must decide
how much information the group can find out, and how
long it will take them. The referee reveals the information
the players have discovered, and tells how much time was
used up, and any other relevant details (or irrelevant details
intended to throw the players off track) that the player
characters may have noticed, like the fact that someone is
following them as they leave the library.
Many times, it will be useful to think of a situation in
present day terms, scaled down a little. For starport,
think of airport or seaport. For world, think instead of
country. The use of analogies will help you to resolve
most situations easily.
Game Time: The passage of game time is of great importance.
Player characters' actions must be measured
against those of the rest of the universe. One of the most
important parts of being a good referee is keeping proper
track of the passage of game time. One of the greatest tools
available to a referee is the ability to make players waste
game time on items unrelated to the task at hand, especially
if the group is working against a specific deadline. The ratio
of real time to game time is left up to the referee. Obviously,
it must be a flexible ratio, depending on circum·
stances.
Referees should watch out, however, for situations
which take almost no game time, but take a great deal of
real time. For instance if a character wants to know certain
details of a door he is about to go through, he might ask
"How big is it?" On being told, he might ask "Is it shut or
open? Can I see anything through it or is the area beyond it
dark?" All of this information could be gained in a few
seconds of observation if the player were actually present;
it is the artificial nature of the game that makes it take so
long. Referees should not count this against the passage of
game time.
In addition, the passage of time may cost the characters
money. Characters must eat and must have lodging. Characters
who suffer aging effects may require medical care.
Starships must be maintained at regular intervals, or they
will deteriorate. Simply by causing the players to become
side-tracked while investigating some minor puzzle, a
referee can cause their schedule to become upset and their
intricately planned schemes to fail.
Outside Influences: The actions of forces in the universe
other than the players should not be neglected, and must be
almost constantly on the referee's mind. A group of characters
might run afoul of the law while completing a job, or
might anger some local criminal organization. If the referee
decides that something of this nature has happened, he or
she must decide what action (if any) the offended party (or
parties) will take, how long that action will take to put
into motion, and what effect the action will have on the
players. Sometimes it will be necessary for a referee to keep
track of several such "plots" at once, while running a group
of player characters who are often blissfully unaware of the
happenings around them.
As the session continues, the players will often engage in
discussions of varying lengths. The referee should try to
Introduction
keep these discussions on track (don't let them stray to
outside events, such as a replay of last night's football
game, or a blow-by-blow of a similar situation in another
game), but otherwise should let them run their course. As
the discussion takes place, the referee should consider what
is really happening to the characters and how long it takes
in game terms. If the characters begin a loud argument in
the middle of a restaurant, for instance, the owner will
interrupt them and ask them to leave. If the adventurers are
having the argument in the privacy of their own spaceship,
however, the referee need only figure out how much game
time the discussion takes, and let it run its course. Many
times, these interludes will allow the referee time to "catch
up" with the action, and plan out what will happen to the
characters next. Keep half an ear tuned to what they are
saying, and offer such advice as may be needed, but other·
wise, enjoy the short break from the frantic activity of
refereeing. As the adventure progresses, the referee will
often have the urge to "help out" the players by providing
them with information that they otherwise would not, or
could not logically know. This is poor form, and the
referee should resist this urge whenever it arises. The function
of a referee is to guide, not control. The only time a
referee should directly intervene is when a group of be·
ginners has gotten itself into such a hopeless situation that
the referee is certain it will not be able to extricate itself,
and the referee does not wish to force the full consequences
upon the players. As the referee gains experience in in·
directly giving information to the players (through non·
player characters, rumors, library data, and other sources),
the urge to hand out "divine revelations" will lessen.
Direct intervention of the referee in a situation is also
poor form. Referees should not get into the habit of
stepping into their universes to put right some anomaly
unless there is no alternative. Many referees use this course
of action instead of thinking of a more subtle means of
correcting a situation. The hand of a good referee, like that
of a good puppeteer, should be invisible.
As referee, don't be afraid to kill off characters who
have gotten themselves into tight spots, especially if they
15

16
Introduction
have done so as a result of foolhardy play. In the so-called
real world, the clever, heroic individuals are as often struck
down in their prime as the rash, incautious types. Con·
versely, it is a good idea to be compassionate now and
then. It is very easy for a player to become heavily ego·
involved with a character, and resent what appears to be
arbitrary cruelty by the referee. Sometimes a particular
character will deserve a miraculous escape from a tight spot.
This is perfectly acceptable, as this sort of thing happens in
the "real world" also.
The End of the Session: An adventuring session should
end when the players' goal is reached if a scenario is being
conducted, or when some convenient stopping place is
reached if a campaign is being undertaken. In any case, the
session should be ended before the players or referee are
exhausted (four to six hours is a fair limit). It may not be
possible to resolve a particular scenario in one session, and
certainly will not be possible to exhaust the possibilities of
any competently designed universe in such a time. When a
stopping point is reached (usually some temporary lull in
the action, when the players are guaranteed safety for the
next few minutes of game time) the referee should make
written notes of the situation, paying particular attention
to the condition of characters and noting any special
aspects of the situation (if they are on a vacuum world with
their air supply running out, and so on). The session can
then be picked up where it stopped during the next session,
even if considerable time passes.
When the players have accomplished their goal , the
scenario is over, but if the session is part of a campaign, the
referee's work is not yet ended. The referee must determine
whether the players will receive the reward they were pro·
mised (this should usually be the case, but having a patron
skip out without paying is a useful plot device). Additional·
ly, the referee should decide if the actions of the players
(either in the process of completing the job or some activity
they have done unrelated to it) have caused them to gain
Game Designers' Workshop
friends or enemies. If this happens, the referee should figure
out who these NPCs are, how happy or angry they are with
the players, and what action, if any, they will take, either
on the players' behalf or against them. Friends in high
places can be very beneficial, and enemies anywhere add
excitement and thrills to any campaign. If your players
should happen to run afoul of the law, pursue them with
any interplanetary or interstellar agencies the crime makes
appropriate. There's nothing like being chased by some
interstellar version of Interpol or the KGB to add spice to a
character's otherwise dull, drab, wretched existence.
Obnoxious or obstreperous behavior should not be
tolerated by the referee. A word or two of warning may be
adequate, but a continually disruptive player should be
ejected from the group. The referee owes this to himself
and to the other players.
By the same token, a referee has a duty to the players to
remain calm and collected. Losing one's temper is no fun
for anybody involved.
As time passes, the referee will gain experience, and the
players and referee will become accustomed to each others'
styles and desires. Adventuring sessions will become
smoother and the pleasure received from an evening's
adventure will increase for all involved.
DIE ROLLING CONVENTIONS
Routinely in the course of Traveller, dice must be
thrown to determine an effectively random result or unpredictable
course of action. These dice throws may be
made by players for their characters, or by the referee for
the effects of nature, non-players, or unseen forces. Rolls
by the referee may be kept secret or partially concealed
depending on their effects. In situations where the players
would not actually know the results of the roll or would
not know the exact roll made, the refe ree should make the
roll in secret. Generally, a dice throw involves two dice;
exceptions requiring one die or three or more dice are
clearly stated. The number of dice is either stated directly
(one die, four dice) or abbreviated to save space (10, 40).
The following ~erms and conventions for dice throws apply
to the game.
Throw: That d ice roll required to achieve a stated effect.
If only a number is stated, it must be rolled exactly. A
number followed by a plus (such as 8+) indicates that the
number or greater must be rolled. Similarly, a number fol lowed
by a minus (such as 6-) indicates that that number or
less must be rolled. Throws can be identified because the
sign follows the number.
Die Modifier (abbreviated OM); A number to be applied
to a die roll before it is used. Die modifiers are preceded by
a sign which indicates whether the number is to be added to
or subtracted from the die roll. Thus, +4 would be added to
the die roll while -2 would be subtracted.
Interpolation: In many cases, the ru les may call for the
generation of a random number within a specific range,
such as from 10 to 60. In this case, inspection of the
highest number will give the number of dice to be rolled
and the multiplier to be applied. For instance, if the rules
call for 10 to 60 animals to appear, the referee may deduce
that one die is to be rolled and the result multiplied by 10.

Characters
Characters are the central focus of Traveller; they are the alter-egos of the players, and all activity centers on them. Each
character is a person within the game, and has abilities and characteristics which define his or her actions and reactions. The
character is the Traveller personality; the player is the person engaged in playing the game. A player character is a character
manipulated by a player. A non-player character is a character manipulated by the referee in order to allow interaction
between the player characters and the universe. Once a player character is generated, he or she continues to live an exciting
life of adventure in the Traveller universe. This life ends only with death or disability. Non-player characters (NPCs) appear
and disappear as the referee needs them.
All characters begin the game the same way: untrained, inexperienced, and about 18 years of age. Each character is
generated with a series of die rolls. He or she then embarks on an abstract career in order to gain skills and experience.
Ultimately, the character retires or leaves the service, receives mustering-out benefits, and is ready to begin adventuring.
INITIAL CHARACTER GENERATION
Characters are essentially described by six characteristics
describing the physical and mental attributes of the indi·
vidual. These characteristics are generated through a series
of six two-dice rolls. Roll two dice for each of the charac·
teristics given on the characteristics table. Record the
results on paper.
Values for the six generated characteristics may range
initially from 2 to 12 (with 7 the average value). As a result
of various modifications, characteristic values may ultim·
ately range from 1 to 15. For player-characters the values
of characteristics may not exceed 15; they do not go below
1 except for the results of calamitous injury or aging.
Obviously, it is possible for a player to generate a
character with seemingly unsatisfactory values; never·
the less, each player should use the character as it is created.
The experience procedures and acquired skills table offer a
genuine opportunity to enhance values, given only time and
luck. Should a player truly consider the character so poor
as to be beyond help, various options in the experience
procedures are available to the player to improve charac·
teristics.
The Universal Personality Profile: Characters in Traveller
are precisely defined using the universal personality profile
(the UPP), which expresses the basic characteristics in a
specific sequence using hexadecimal (base 16) numbers. In
hexadecimal notation, the numbers 0 through 9 are repre·
sented by the common arabic numerals; the numbers 10
through 15 are represented by the letters A through F. The
highest single-digit number in base 16 notation is 15 (F).
Characteristics are listed as a string of six digits, in the order
originally rolled: strength, dexterity, endurance, intelli·
gence, education, and social standing.
For example, a character who is totally average in all
respects would have a UPP of 777777. If, instead, the
individual were highly intelligent, his UPP would be
777877 (the B in the fourth position indicates an intelli·
gence of 11 ).
While the use of the UPP is optional, it allows the referee
(and the players) to tell at a glance the characteristics of
persons they encounter and have dealings with. Because the
hexadecimal notation uses single digits or letters for each of
the six characteristics, numbers which are normally two
digits cannot become confused and give false readings to
the players and referee.
Naming: Once generated, the character should be
named. There are several schools of thought on the nature
of names. One school holds that the character should carry
the name of the player; the referee can then refer to John
or Marsha, and everyone knows exactly who's who. This
usage is convenient, but tends to lose some of the flavor of
the campaign.
Another school of thought calls for the use of pseudo·
nyms or fanciful names (for example: Alexander Lascelles
Jamison, or Timothy Fairweather; more extremely, Seeker
or Starkiller). As with everything involved in Traveller, the
actual choice depends only on the players and on their
imaginations.
Titles: The social standing characteristic shows relative
position within society for the individual. Those with
social standing of B+ (11 or greater) are considered to be
noble, and may assume their family's hereditary title.
Noble titles are commonly used, even if the individual is
not engaged in local government. At the discretion of the
referee, a world may be generated (see Worlds) and the
noble may have some ancestral lands or fiefs on it.
CHARACTERISTICS
Strength is both a general evaluation of the charac·
ter's physical ability and a specific measure of force
which may be applied.
Dexterity measures physical co-ordination.
Endurance measures personal determination and
stamina.
Intelligence corresponds to 10.
Education indicates the highest level of schooling
attained by the individual.
Social Standing notes the social class and level of
society from which the character (and his or her
family) comes.
Other Attributes: In the course of character generation,
the character will acquire age (in years and in four year
terms). rank, money, skills, and possessions.

Characters
A knight (social standing B) is entitled to the use of Sir
(or Dame) before his or her name. Social standing C entitles
the individual to the title Baron or Baroness. In lieu of this
title, the individual may use the prefix von or haut or
hault (denoting baronial nobility) with his or her name.
The noble ranks table shows the range of noble titles and
their corresponding social levels.
ACQUIRING SKILLS AND EXPERTISE
Any newly-generated character may choose one of these
six services (Navy, Marines, Army, Scouts, Merchants, and
Other), and attempt to enlist. The prior service table
gives the service enlistment throw required to enlist. Successfully
throwing that number or higher on two dice
allows enlistment. Most services allow die modifications if
the character has one or two characteristics of a certain
level or higher. If both characteristics are present in the
required level, the die modification is cumulative.
For example, the enlistment throw for the Navy is 8+;
OM of +1 is allowed for intelligence of 8 or greater, and OM
of +2 is allowed for education of 9 or greater. Assuming a
character Hylan Vincent, 8946A8 (intelligence of 6 and
education of 10) attempted to enlist in the Navy, he would
be allowed a OM of +2 (for his education). He rolls a 3 on
two dice, adds his OM of +2 to get a 5 (he needs 8+), which
is insufficient. The Navy has rejected his enlistment.
Only one enlistment attempt is permitted per character.
If rejected for enlistment, he must submit to the draft.
Enlistment or draft is not allowed after age 18.
The Draft: Should an attempt at enlistment fail, the
character must submit to the draft. Each of the six services
has a draft number; the draftee rolls one die and enters the
service with that draft number. Note that it is possible for a
character to be drafted into the very service which had just
previously rejected an enlistment.
Draftees are not eligible for commissions during their
first term of service; they do become eligible during the
second and subsequent terms of service if they reenlist.
Terms of Service: Upon enlistment (or upon being
drafted), a character embarks on a term of service lasting
four years. This adds four years to the character's age.
Each time a character reenlists, it is for an additional four
year term of service.
Survival: Each term of service involves some danger;
during the term, a character must successfully throw his
service's survival number to avoid death in the line of
duty. Each service also has OMs which may apply. Failure
to successfully achieve the survival throw results in death; a
new character must be generated.
-Optional Rule: If the referee or player chooses prior to
character generation, then a failure of the survival roll can
be converted to injury. The character is not dead; instead
he or she is injured, and leaves the service (after recovery)
having served only two years of the four year term. The
short term is not counted for mustering out benefits.
Commissions and Promotions: Each service has a com·
mission number; in order to be commissioned as an officer,
the character must throw the stated number. OMs may
apply to the throw. If the commission is achieved, the
character receives rank 1 in the service. A character may
Game Designers' Workshop
attempt to acquire a commission once per term of service
until successful, but a draftee may not at tempt to acquire a
commission in the first term of service.
In the same term of service that a commission is received
and in each subsequent term of service, a character may
attempt to be promoted. Each service has a promotion
number and OMs affecting that promotion throw. If a
promotion is achieved, the character advances to the next
higher rank in the service. A character is eligible for one
promotion per term of service.
Commissions and promotions are not available in the
Scout Service or in the Other Service.
Skills and Training: During each term of service, a
character has the opportunity to acquire personal skills and
expertise. Allowances are made for the acquisition of new
skills based on service, duty, commission, and promotion.
Skills are acquired by rolling on the acquired skills table
once for each skill allowed, using one die. There are four
tables, each containing different general types of skills. One
of the tables is chosen before the die is rolled, and the
single die roll determines the specific skill acquired.
Of the four acquired skill tables, the first three may
always be used by a character. The fourth is available only
through advanced education, and may be used only by
characters who have an education characteristic of 8 or
greater.
During the character's first term of service, he or she
becomes eligible for two skills; during each additional term
of service, the character becomes eligible for one skill.
Upon receiving a commission, he or she becomes eligible for
one skill. Upon being promoted, the character becomes
eligible for one skill. Thus, a character who joins the Navy,
receives a commission, and then receives a promotion
during the initial term of service becomes eligible for four
skills. The same character, in the next term, is eligible for
one skill if he or she does not receive another promotion.
Some skills are automatically acquired by a character
(without using eligibility) by virtue of rank or service.
These automatic skills are listed on the rank and service
skills table. At the point when the character achieves the
indicated rank or service, he or she gets the indicated skill.
The scout service is an except ion to the normal eligibili·
ties. Because the service has no rank or promotion, scout
characters do not become eligible for extra skills during
their careers. Instead, however, scouts receive two skills for
each term of service, including the first.
Reenl istment: Generally, a character is free to leave the
service or to remain for another term, depending on the
individual's goals and desires. As always, the possibilities of
war, peace, and other considerations loom ever-present over
the character's career, and may force others to decide the
course of the career. Each service has a reenlistment number;
in order to undertake a subsequent term of service, a
character must throw that number or greater (no OMs are
allowed). If t he throw is not successful, reenlistment has
been denied, and the person must leave the service. If the
throw is 12 (exactly), the needs of the service require that
the character serve another term, regardless of his or her
personal desires. The reenlistment throw is required during
each term of service.

The Traveller Book
Retirement: A character may serve up to seven terms of
service voluntarily, and may leave after any term (provided
mandatory reenlistment - a reenlistment throw of 12
exactly - does not occur). A person may retire any time
after the end of the fifth term. Retirement grants the
individual an annual retirement pay (in addition to any
mustering out benefits); rates of retirement pay are shown
in the retirement pay table.
Service beyond the seventh term is normally impossible,
and retirement is mandatory for an individual who has
completed a seventh term of service. However, persons who
throw mandatory reenlistment must instead serve that
additional term of service. It is theoretically possible for an
individual to be required to serve ninth and even tenth
terms under mandatory reenlistment.
MUSTERING OUT
When a character leaves the service (for any reason), he
or she is eligible for mustering out benefits. The two
mustering out tables indicate the nature of these benefits:
one provides travel, education, and material benefits, while
the other provides cash severance pay. Each table is ma·
trixed by service and a single die roll. When mustering out
of the service, a character is allowed to consult these
tables based on total terms of service and on final rank.
One benefit roll is allowed for each full term served (if,
under the optional survival roll, a character serves only half
a term, that term is not counted toward muster-out). Addi·
tionally, a character who has received rank 1 or 2 receives
one extra roll. A character who has received rank 3 or 4
receives two extra rolls. A character who has received rank
5 or 6 receives three extra rolls, and in addition may apply
a OM of +1 to die rolls on the skills and benefits table. Any
character who has acquired the skill of gambling-1 or
higher may add +1 to the die roll on the cash table.
A character is free to choose between the benefits table
and the cash table, but no one may consult the cash table
more than three times during the mustering out process.
For example, an uncommissioned character who has
served four terms of service is eligible for four mustering
out benefits. She may roll a total of four times, distributing
the rolls as she desires between the two tables, provided
only that she may roll no more than three times on the cash
table. The player must designate the table being used before
rolling the die.
AGING
Because each term of service is four years in length, a
character can potentially age twenty years or more before
venturing into the adventure portion of the game. This
aging may even have a detrimental effect on a character's
strength, dexterity, endurance, and even intelligence.
When a character reaches 34 years of age (the end of the
fourth term of service) aging begins to take its toll. The
aging table must be consulted then, and thereafter at four
year intervals. This table shows each of the characteristics
affected, and the throws necessary to avoid the effects of
aging. If a specific throw is failed, then the reduction
indicated is applied to the characteristic.
In some situations, the use of drugs (to speed up or slow
Charactefs
down the body chemistry) or low passage (suspended
animation for low cost travel) will make the character age
faster or slower than a strict game calendar would indicate.
It is therefore quite important that each player maintQin
careful records on his or her character's physical age.
Aging Crisis: If, as a result of aging, a characteristic is
reduced to zero, the character is considered to have had an
aging crisis and become quite ill. A basic saving throw of 8+
applies to avoid death (subject to a OM for the expertise of
any attending medical skill). If the character survives,
recovery is made immediately (under slow drug, which
speeds up the body chemistry). The character ages (one die
equals the number of months in added age under slow drug)
immediately, but also returns to play without delay. The
characteristic which was reduced to zero automatically
becomes 1. This process occurs each time (and for each
characteristic) a characteristic is reduced to zero. In the
event that slow drug is not available, the individual is
incapacitated for the number of months indicated if the
basic throw of 8+ is successful.
Disability: Characters may quit adventuring when they
reach age 66, if any one physical characteristic (strength,
dexterity, or endurance) permanently equals 1, or if the
sum of all three physical characteristics equals 10 or less.
When a character quits adventuring, he or she leaves the
game, taking along all money and possessions. The player
is then· free to generate a new character. Quitting due to
disability is available to allow players to maintain reasonably
competent characters. 19

Characters
NON·PLA YER CHARACTERS
Sometimes (often) player characters will encounter
people not actually manipulated by a player. They may be
thugs or assailants; they may be potential hirelings or
patrons. In any case, their skills and abilities should be
determined by the referee using the character generation
procedure.
For example, a starship captain may be looking for a
crew for his ship. The referee would generate characters
until one occurs with the required skill (medical, naviga·
tion, etc.). Generally, the first appropriate character to be
generated would present himself or herself for employment,
and if not accepted (or unsuitable) a delay would occur
before another becomes available. As an alternative, the
referee may simply generate a character and assign the
required skill plus a few others for variety. Similarly, the
characteristics of thugs and brigands who are menacing
player characters, or of people presenting themselves for
hire, may be determined and recorded for use when neces·
sary.
Loyalty and Dedication: In most cases, non-player
characters will be dependable and loyal (assuming the
absence of bad treatment by their employers); the possi·
bility exists, however, that a seemingly loyal non-player
character has foul play at heart. The referee should utilize
the character reaction table (see Encounters) to determine
such potential, and note such possibilities as they exist.
Continued loyalty of non-player characters is ultimately
dependent on the quality of treatment and level of skill of
their employing player characters.
Character Generation: Most players new to Traveller
spend some time in the generation of various character
types. It is recommended that the referee save these charac·
ters for future use as non-player characters, hirel ings, and
other types.
Game Designers' Workshop
CAREER TYPES
The six career types generated here are general careers
assumed to ex ist in the human societies within the galaxy.
For players who are adventuring within the general human
Imperium that serves as a background for Traveller, these
services are commonplace and ordinary. The services shown
are also sufficiently general to allow their use in virtually all
Traveller situations. They can be described as follows:
Navy: Members of the interstellar space navy which
patrols the space between the stars. The navy has respon·
sibility for the protection of society from lawless elements
in the interstellar trade channels and from foreign powers.
Naval characters will tend to be familiar with the tech·
nical aspects of space flight, such as navigation, with
such things as advanced electronics and engineering
necessary to running their giant starships, and with the
less complex aspects of space such as vacc suits.
Marines: Members of the armed fighting forces carried
aboard starships. Marines deal with piracy and boarding
actions in space, defend the starports and bases belonging
to the navy, and supplement other ground forces.
Marine characters will accumulate skills related to their
roles in ship-to-ship and surface combat, as well as a
smattering of more technical skills such as mechanical and
computer.
Army: Members of the planetary armed fighting forces.
Soldiers deal with planetary surface actions, battles, and
campaigns. They may also serve as mercenaries for hire.
Scouts: Members of the exploratory service. Scouts
explore new areas, map and survey known or newly d is·
covered areas, and maintain the communications ships
which carry information and messages between the worlds
of the galaxy.
Since they are often expected to operate on their own,
scout characters receive skills related to all aspects of space
flight from pilot to engineering and mechanical.
Merchants: Members of the commercial enterprises.
Merchants may crew the ships of the large trading corpora·
tions, or they may work for the independent free traders
which carry chance cargos and passengers between worlds.
Merchant characters may be constantly on the move, or
may remain in one place throughout their term of service.
Merchants can engage in every activity from plodding, con·
ventional commerce, through quasi-legal actions, to out·
right violations of the law such as smuggling. Merchants
can accumulate skills relating to space flight, such as
pilot and navigation, to trade, such as admin, and to less
technical but equally important aspects of life, such as
brawling, gambling, and forgery.
Other: Characters who do not serve in one of the above
services instead follow careers in a variety of occupations,
legal and illegal, collectively called the Other. The Other
service covers some trades not mentioned above, and
the nether realm of the underworld. Not all characters in
the Other are ex-criminals. A character with skills in
bribery, forgery, and streetwise could be a former govern·
ment undercover agent as easily as a counterfeiter. The
exact nature of the career of any specific character in
the Other service must be deduced from the skills and
benefits received during character generation.

The Traveller Book
SKILLS
The skills which can be acquired during a term of service
are of greatly diverse types and values. Skills form an
integral part of the player's character. assisting the referee
(and the player) in calculating both general abilities and the
specific probability of performing certain tasks.
Skills are differentiated by level: skill-3 (meaning level 3
of a specific skill) is higher and more sophisticated than
skill-2. There are a finite number of skills listed, and it is
possible that one specific skill may be acquired more than
once; in such cases, the second acquisition increases the
character's expertise in that skill. Upon the first acquisition
of a skill, the player writes the skill name, followed by a
dash and the number 1 (thus: navigation-1 ). The second
time the skill is acquired, the number is increased to show
greater expertise (thus: navigation-2). Additional acquisitions
of the same skill will increase this skill level to 3, 4, or
even higher.
The acquired skills table provides four basic types of
results: characteristic alterations (such as +1 strength),
weapons expertise (such as blade combat). transport skills
(such as ATV). and basic skills (such as navigation).
Characteristic Alterations: Expressed as an addition to
(or subtraction from) a character's ability. In this category,
alterations tend to affect strength, dexterity, or endurance
(although some services can affect other abilities as well).
Characteristic alterations are applied immediately, and
require no further attention. An example of a characteristic
alteration is +1 dexterity.
Characteristic alterations reflect physical (or other)
training while in the service. A result of +1 strength may
mean that the service has required a regimen of calisthenics
which has improved the individual's strength.
Weapo ns Expertise: Expressed as a general trait, such as
brawling, blade combat, gun combat, or gunnery. When
acquired, the character notes the area of expertise, and
immediately selects the specific type of skill received. Thus,
if gun combat is received, the character must select which
type of gun the expertise is in. Gunnery and brawling do
not require any selection because they have no subdivisions.
All player characters have an innate weapon expertise, in
all weapons on t he list, of zero. Acquisition of a weapon
skill boosts this to Ievei-l. Additional acquisitions of expertise
in the same weapon increase the current level by one.
Brawling: Brawling is a general skill for hand-to-hand
combat, and includes hands, clubs, and bottles as weapons.
Bl ade Combat : Blade combat is a specific skill in the use
of blades and polearms. The character may select one blade
or polearm each time blade combat is received. The blades
and polearms table indicates the weapons available under
this skill. Selection of a specific blade or polearm should be
a discriminating decision; the table is intended to assist in
that decision even for players still unfamiliar with the
Traveller combat system. Following each listed weapon are
three columns. The +OM column indicates the minimum
required strength for the character if he or she is to receive
strength bonuses for using the weapon in combat. It is
advantageous for a character to have skill in a weapon
which provides such bonuses. The -OM column shows the
level of strength (or less) which calls for mandatory
Characters
strength penalties for using the weapon in combat; such
penalties are to be avoided. Finally, the wounds column
indicates the degree of wounding ability which the weapon
has; it indicates relative power of the weapons.
A character may select one weapon each time that blade
combat skill is received. In the event that a character
receives blade combat three times, he might choose, for
example, cutlass-2 (taking cutlass twice) and dagger-1, or
decide to concentrate on one weapon, perhaps taking foi l-3.
Note that one of the possible weapons is named blade.
Players must be careful to designate the weapon or weapons
they have selected; otherwise, skill defaults to the edged
weapon named blade.
Gun Combat: Gun combat is a specific skill in the use of
firearms. The character must immediately choose one
firearm from the guns table; a different gun may be selected
each time that the skill is received. The table contains
columns indicating positive or negative OMs, but the OMs
for guns are based on dexterity (not on strength).
Gunnery: Gunnery is a skill in the use of weapons
mounted on board spacecraft (beam and pulse lasers,
sandcasters, and missile launchers). This skill entitles the
individual to the job title of gunner. Space combat is
covered in the chapter on space combat.
Transport Skills: Receipt of a transport skill indicates
that the character can operate a vehicle within a specific
category. Where the category is further subdivided, the
individual must select one of the subdivisions.
Basic Skills: Basic skills are expressed as a general ability,
such as navigation or engineering. Each skill is further
defined on the following pages.

Characters Game Designers' Workshop
Skills described on this page: Administration, Air/ Raft, ATV, Blade Combat, Brawling, Bribery, Computer.
Administration: The individual has had experience with
bureaucratic agencies, and understands the requirements
of dealing with them and managing them.
When contact with officials is required, understanding
their needs and motives will assist in dealing with them. A
basic throw of 7+ will successfully resolve normal interaction
without further problems (such as avoidance of
police harrassment, insuring prompt issuance of licenses,
approval of applications, avoidance of close inspection of
papers, etc.). Apply these OMs: no expertise, -3; per level
of admin expertise, +2.
When serving in a bureaucratic organization, admin
expertise allows competency in the eyes of superiors. Apply
a OM of +1 per level of expertise, with the exact throw to
be determined by the referee under the circumstances.
Referee: Admin expertise should also affect the quality
of work and potential for success of an organization which
the character is controlling or managing.
Air/Raft: The individual has training and experience in
the use and operation of the air/raft, floater, flier, and all
types of grav vehicles.
The air/ raft is the major transportation vehicle on most
worlds with high enough tech levels. Most people are aware
of the basics of operation for such vehicles. The air/raft can
be dangerous to operate in high speed situations or in bad
weather. A basic throw of 5+ to avoid an accident or
mishap in bad weather, chases, or high speed maneuvers
should be used. Apply these OMs: per leve l of expertise,
+1; if weather is extremely bad, if the craft is old, or if
gunfire is involved in the chase, -1. Generally, roll once for
a short chase, twice or three t imes for longer flights.
Referee: A ir/ raft and grav veh icle are interchangeable
and identical skills. The chapter on equipment provides
descriptions of various grav vehicles including the air/ raft.
ATV: The individual is acquainted with modern all
terrain vehicles, and has been trained in, or has experience
with, their operation. The term ATV (all terrain vehicle)
includes AFV (armored fighting vehicle) and covers both
wheeled and tracked vehicles.
The ATV is used, in varying forms, on frontier and
airless worlds, or in situations where weather, atmosphere,
or players' intent preclude the use of air/rafts or aircraft.
ATVs are quite rel iable (throw 11+ per day for mechanical
breakdowns), but are susceptible to off-road difficulties
such as becoming bogged down in mud or sand or trapped
by jungle growth. Generally, driver expertise will serve as a
OM (+1 per level) to help avoid such difficulty.
Referee: ATV sk ill will also serve to allow increased
speed and greater maneuverability. It allows the individual
to diagnose malfunct ions within the vehicle, to help repair
them, and to perform preventive maintenance on the ATV.
Bladl! Combat: The individual is skilled in the use of
a specif ic blade or edged weapon. The use of various blade
weapon sk ills by individuals is governed by the chapter on
personal combat.
Brawling: The individual is skilled in basic hand-to-hand
combat and can engage in simple fighting without weapons
or with typical improvised weapons such as clubs. Brawling
by individual characters is governed by the chapter on
personal combat.
Bribery: The individual has experience in bribing offici
als in order to circumvent regulations or ignore cumbersome
laws. Bribery sk ill does not guarantee success, but
does minimize bad effects if the offer is rebuffed.
Petty officials can generally be bribed to ignore regulations
or poor documentation, requiring a throw of the law
level of the world in question or less (plus a cash offer) to
do as asked. If the first offer is refused, a second roll may
be made with the cash offer doubled. The character offering
the bribe should first roll on the reaction table (see
Encounters) and should not offer to a negatively reacting
official. Apply these OMs: no expertise, +5; per level of
expertise, -1; if the official reacts as a strong friend on the
reaction table (a roll of 12), -2.
Referee: Insure that both the cash offered and the act
solicited are reasonable; if not, implement appropriate OMs.
Note that the roll for accepting a bribe varies inversely with
the law level of a world; the more stringent the laws, the
greater the corruption. If a bribe is not accepted, roll 3- for
the offer to be reported to higher authorities.
Computer: The individual is sk illed in the programming
and operation of electronic and f ibre optic computers, both
ground and shipboard models.
Computers perform valuable functions in human society,
and individuals capable of using them f ind that their skill is
equally valuable. Characters with computer expertise
may be hired (when needed) to operate and program
computers for organizations, ships, or other employers.
Computer programs (especially starship programs as
required for starship operation) are widely available,
although for relatively high prices. It is also possible that
such programs may be written by characters with computer
skill. The individual must have access to a computer which
will handle the intended program, knowledge of the skill
being incorporated, and no other duties, responsibilities, or
distractions during each week of work. For more details,
see Computers.
Referee: In spite of all good intentions, there is always
the possib ility that any program written will have a fatal
flaw and will not funct ion when actually put to use in
a cri tical situation. Throw 7 exactly for a fatal error to be
written in. If there is none, throw 5- for a negative OM to
appear on the program when used; there is a half chance
that the OM will be -1 or - 2. These flaws will generally
remain hidden until the program is actually used; the
referee simply institutes any failure or OM without comment.
Debugging a program that does not seem t o function
well may find the flaw, or impose other f laws.
When characters want to write computer programs, the
general procedure shown in Computers should be used,
with appropriate modifications for the specific purpose.

The Traveller Book Characters
Skills described on this page: Electronics, Engineering, Forgery, Forward Observer, Gambling.
Electronics: The individual has skill in the use, operation,
and repair of electronic devices. The person is considered
handy in this field, with the equivalent of a green
thumb; this skill includes the repair of energy weapons.
An advanced technological civilization depends heavily
on the use of electronic devices. The need to use, repair,
and replace electronic devices is ubiquitous.
Electronic expertise allows a character to use and
operate electronic items; generally the skill is a DM applied
to the throw to understand, repair, assemble, or operate.
Complex items would also require a certain level of education
or a very high intelligence; many devices may also
require some degree of dexterity to disassemble, repair, and
reassemble.
Referee: Specific throws for specific situations must be
generated. Obviously, some throws will be harder than
others, and many will be impossible without an accumulation
of DMs based on expertise, education, dexterity,
intelligence, and the availability of parts and tools. To
generate a specific throw, the referee analyzes the specific
circumstances and selects a number to be thrown (usually
throw that number or greater to succeed). DMs allowed
should be the level of electronics skill, +1 for intelligence
above some level (say, 10). +1 for education above some
level (say, 9), and appropriate values for lack of tools
(perhaps -5) or poor conditions (maybe -3). The throw
is then made, and success is determined by the result.
Such throws are restricted to one per specific time period,
an hour, four hours, a day, or a week, as appropriate.
Engineering: The individual is skilled in the operation
and maintenance of starship maneuver drives, jump drives,
and power plants.
Engineering experience enables an individual to operate
the vital drives of starships (and interplanetary craft) and to
maintain the machinery against failure.
The engineer is essential for the proper operation of any
starships. Expertise qualifies the individual for such jobs,
and can be used to get working passage on a ship in need of
help. Greater levels of expertise enable the individual
to handle problems of greater complexity and jobs with
higher levels of responsibility.
Referee: Skill level is generally a DM applied to the
throw to remedy an engineering problem. In order to
handle the relative value of experience, the DM may be
assigned on the basis of +2 per level of expertise.
Forgery: The individual has a sk ill at faking documents
and papers with a view to deceiving officials, banks,
patrons, or other persons.
Documents necessary for cargo transfers, bank transactions,
personal identification, and many other purposes
are often closely inspected by officials such as the police,
customs agents, or clerks when encounters occur (such
encounters happen when the law level for a world or less is
thrown; generally once or twice per day). The throw for
detection of forged or fake documents is 6+; DMs to be
applied: -2 per level of expertise.
Referee: Forgery is a useful skill, but control is required
to prevent blatant misuse (to provide a bottomless checking
account, for example). Note that administration and
bribery may also be used to determine whether documents
are actually examined by the individuals involved.
Forward Observer: The individual has been trained (in
military service) to call on and adjust artillery {projecti le,
missile, and laser) fire from distant batteries and from
ships in orbit.
Modern fire support can be a tremendously effective
weapon, when available, but is virtually useless unless the
technique of its application and adjustment is known. If
artillery of any form (including communication w ith the
firing battery) is available, the first shots fired will invariably
miss the target. On each subsequent turn in which
such fire is delivered, a basic throw of 11+ to hit is required.
Apply these DMs: +4 per level of expertise; per
adjustment (two minutes per adjustment), +1 ; if adjusting
person has no expertise: -4.
Gambling: The individual is well informed on games of
chance, and wise in their play. He or she has an advantage
over nonexperts, and is generally capable of winning
when engaged in such games. Gambling, however, should
not be confused w ith general risk-taking.
Organized games (as in casinos) allow bets of up to
Cr5000, and require a throw of 9+ to win. Private games
allow bets ranging from Cr50 to Cr5000, and requ ire a
throw of 8+ to win. Gambling skill allows a DM of +1 per
level, but the house always wins on a throw of 2 exactly.
Games may be crooked (throw 10+ to be dishonest) in
which case the referee will stack the odds against the
players. Gambling-3 or better will usually detect crooked
games (throw 7+ to detect).
Gambling-4 or better may be suspected of cheating and
the gambler ejected (or worse) due to the finesse of the
skill involved (throw 9+ to be suspected; DM -1 per level
over 4). Characters may elect to use a lower expertise
level in order to avoid detection of true skill level.
Referee: Characters' die rolls should not be divulged
when gambling; instead, merely inform the individuals of
wins and losses. This procedure should serve to conceal any
manipulation of dice throws.

Characters Game Designers' Workshop
Skills described on this page: Gun Combat, Gunnery, Jack of all Trades, Leader, Mechanical, Medical.
Gun Combat: The individual is skilled in the use of
a specific gun weapon. The use of various gun weapon skills
is covered in the chapter on personal combat.
Gunnery: The individual is skilled in the operation of
gunnery mounted on board starships and spacecraft. The
use of such weaponry is covered in the chapter on space
combat.
Defensive and offensive weapons are mounted on a
variety of interplanetary and interstellar vessels. Gunnery
skill qualifies an individual to operate such weaponry,
and to be hired on a ship's crew with the title of gunner.
Gunnery may also be used for simi lar weapons mounted on
ATVs or air/rafts.
Jack of All Trades: The individual is proven capable of
handling a wide variety of situations, and is resourceful in
finding solutions and remedies.
The well·rounded individual (the renaissance man, so to
speak) is uncommon in all societies, but is naturally proficient
when he or she occurs.
This skill is a general ability which may be applied to
nearly any endeavor at the discretion of the referee. The
jack of all trades can attempt activity which is not normally
possible due to the absence of skills or expertise. Un·
skilled people have no idea how to even start many projects;
jack of all trades can apply this skill to such a project
as if he or she has the skill. Jack of all trades can be con·
sidered to confer skill level-0 in every other skill (but never
Ieve i-l ).
For example, one of a group of adventurers arrives at an
aging crisis while on an expedition into the wilds of an
unsettled planet. No one has medical expertise. Jack of
all trades can be applied as a substitute for medical skill in
this situation; the referee should assume that the person has
studied independently at some time or has seen such a crisis
previously and knows something of what to do. When using
jack of all trades skill, the referee should also consider
appropriate personal characteristics (intelligence, education),
availability of equipment (drugs, medical instru·
ments), and other factors (weather, shelter, or the specific
situation).
Leader: The individual has led troops in battle (or on
adventures) and is possessed of a knowledge and selfassurance
which will make for a capable emergent or
appointed leader.
Leadership is a required ability to control a group of
more than six non·player hirelings or soldiers. Such a group
will tend to obey the general orders of the character with
the highest leader expertise. Reaction throws are necessary
when the leader and the group first meet. OMs may be
applied: +1 per level of leader expertise when consulting
the reaction table.
Leader·3 or better is sufficient to allow soldiers to obey
orders without hesitation.
Leader-4 or better will allow a positive OM when re·
cruiting soldiers or hirelings for adventures. The throws and
OMs for such hirelings depend on the situation imposed by
the referee.
Mechanical: The individual has skill in the use, operation,
and repair of mechanical devices. The person is
considered to be handy in this field, with a talent similar to
that of a green thumb. This skill specifically excludes
the field of engineering; it does include nonenergy weapon
repair.
Many of the devices of civilization are strictly mechanical
in nature, and the need to repair, replace, or simply
use them pervades life. Mechanical expertise allows a
character the ability to operate mechanical devices easily, as
well as to repair them quickly and efficiently. Any situation
requiring a knowledge of mechanical aspects of devices or
equipment can be affected by mechanical skill. In this
regard, mechanical skill can be used to allow an understanding
of a situation, if it is mechanical in nature.
Referee: Specific throws for specific situations must be
generated. Obviously, the throw to fabricate a new main
drive bearing as a starship plunges into a flam ing sun would
be harder than the throw to repair a broken air lock hatch
while in port. Success in any mechanical enterprise is also
affected by such variables as tool availability, personal
strength and dexterity, education, and situation.
Medical: The individual has training and skill in the
medical arts and sciences.
Medical science is capable of great feats in preserving and
maintaining the health and welfare of individuals. The
services of medically trained individuals are in great demand.
The levels of medical skill represent steps in increasingly
better ability and knowledge.
Medical-1 is sufficient to qualify a character for the
position of medic on a ;tarship crew. An expertise of
medic-2 or better allows a OM of +1 when reviving low
passengers (each normally throws 5+ to revive after a tr ip;
otherwise the passenger dies).
Medical-3 is sufficient for a character to be called
doctor, and assumes a license to practice medicine, including
writing prescriptions, handling most ailments, and
dealing with other doctors on a professional level. A dex·
terity of 8+ is required for a doctor to also be a surgeon.

The Traveller Book Characters
Skills described on this page: Medical, Navigation, Pilot, Ship's Boat, Steward.
Xeno-Medicine: Normally, medical expertise is con·
sidered to apply to humans, and to a limited extent to the
animals which live on human worlds. Anyone with medical
expertise can apply that expertise (with a reduction of -2)
to non-human aliens. For example, a human doctor
(medical-3) may find herself in a situation which calls for
treatment of an al ien, with anatomy and physiology unfamiliar
to her. She could provide treatment with the
equivalent of medical-1. Obvious encumbrances such as
strange environment or unfamiliar chemistry should also be
considered by the referee.
Navigation: The individual has training and expertise in
the art and science of interplanetary and interstellar navi·
gation.
Travel between worlds depends on the starships and
their crews; the navigator is relied upon to plot the course
and to insure that correct information is made ava ilable to
the pilot and crew as they need it. The navigator interprets
the long-range data provided by the ship's scanners and
detectors.
Navigation expertise quali fies a character for the job
position of navigator on a starship or interplanetary vessel.
Referee: In general, navigation skill allows a character to
perform in a starship crew position which requires this type
of skill. On exploratory missions, or when venturing into
unexplored territory, navigation skill may be used to assist
in the speedy computation of courses, in the accurate
determination of courses, and in the determination of
position when lost or strayed.
Navigation expertise can assist an individual in land or
sea navigation as well. In any situation where directions
need to be known or location must be determined, navi·
gation expertise can be used as a OM of +1 per level on a
throw to determine the needed information. The only
requirement is that the night sky must be visible from the
planetary surface.
Pilot: The individual has training and experience in the
operation of starships and large interplanetary ships. This
skill encompasses both the interplanetary and the inter·
stellar aspects of large ship operation.
Interstellar travel depends on starships and their crews;
the single most important crew position is that of the pi lot,
responsible for control of the starship's lift-offs, landings,
and routine flight. Pilot skill qual ifies a character for the
job of pi lot on a starship over 100 tons.
Referee: Pilot skill is usable as a OM in handling of
starships as they travel. Pilot skill generally refers to inter·
stellar ships; much of the ordinary operation, however, is
similar to that of interplanetary craft and pilot expertise
also applies to large interplanetary craft (100 tons and up).
Small interplanetary craft (under 100 tons) handle some·
what differently; pilot expertise minus 1 may be used as
ship's boat expertise as applied to interplanetary vessels
under 100 tons; thus, an individual with pilot-3 could also
operate a small craft interplanetary vessel as if he or she had
a skill of ship's boat-2. The reverse is not t rue.
Ship's Boat: The individual is familiar with the function
and operation of small interplanetary craft collectively
known as ship's boats. These craft range in size from
five to 100 tons, and include shuttles, lifeboats, launches,
ship's boats, and fighters.
The small interplanetary craft carried as auxiliaries or
boats on larger ships, or serving the needs of bases and
stations, are distinctly different from the large vessels which
ply the space lanes. Ship's boat expertise reflects a distinct
experience and training in the operation of these craft. Pilot
expertise minus 1 can be used as the equivalent level of
ship's boat expertise.
Referee: Ship's boat skill is used as a OM in handling
throws to determine various operations and their results.
The following examples should illustrate this concept.
Assume a hostile attack on a pinnace (small craft) flown by
a character with ship's boat-2. Throw 10+ for the pinnace
to escape on contact and avoid the attack; OM -2 based on
the skill. Throw 8+ to avoid being hit by enemy fire if the
escape attempt fail s; OM -2, again based on the skill.
Alternate these throws until either escape succeeds or the
craft is hit. If the pinnace is hit, throw 5+ for it to be
crippled and boarded; 4 - for the craft to be destroyed; no
OMs apply to t his throw for damage type.
Simil arly, assuming bad weather (storms, wind, etc.) at a
planetary surface landing point, throw 9+ to land safely; +2
per level of expertise above 1.
Steward: The individual is experienced and capable in
the care and feed ing of passengers: the duties of the ship's
steward.
The responsibility for the welfare of passengers aboard a
starship falls on the ship's steward. Although anyone can be
hired as a ship's steward, this skill represents training in
the various duties necessary, and serves as an advantage
when attempting to get such a job.
Referee: Steward skill represents a general awareness of
cooking, personal care and attention, and other areas of
experience which will make passengers and crew happy and
content with their conditions of passage.

Characters Game Designers' Workshop
Skills described on this page: Streetwise, Tactics, Vacc Suit, Vehicle.
Streetwise: The ind ividual is acquainted with the ways
of local subcultures (which tend to be the same everywhere
in human society). and thus is capable of dealing with
strangers without alienating them. This skill is not the same
as alien contact experience.
Close-knit subcultures (such as some portions of the
lower classes, trade groups such as workers, and the under·
world) generally reject contact with strangers or unknown
elements. Streetwise expertise allows contact for the
purposes of obtaining information, hiring persons, pur·
chasing or selling contraband or stolen goods, and other
shady or borderline activities.
Referee: After establishing throws for various activities
desired by the characters (such as the name of an official
willing to issue licenses without hassle : 5+; the location of
high quality guns at low prices: 9+). allow streetwise as a
OM. If streetwise is not used, impose a OM of - 5.
Tactics: The individual has training and experience in
small unit tactics (up to and including units of 1000 troops
or individual spaceships). This sk ill is not to be confused
with strategy, which deals with the reasons for the en·
counter and the intended results of the encounter; strategy
is the realm of the players, rather than the characters.
When small units encounter hostile forces (in battle, or
while adventuring), tactical skill provides an advantage
toward winning, or at least reducing the disaster of defeat.
Referee: Because tactical skill is an intangible, the exact
results in battle are left to the referee to implement as
necessary or prudent. It might influence the type and
amount of information available to the character in the
miniature figure resolution of a battle which uses hidden
movement, or can be a OM in crucial situations.
Tactical skill should be considered by the referee when
the character is applying for military-type employment.
Vacc Suit: The individual has been trained and has
experience in the use of the standard vacuum suit (space
suit), including armored battle dress and suits for use on
various planetary surfaces in the presence of exotic, corrosive,
or insidious atmospheres.
Non-breathable atmospheres or hostile environments can
be easily overcome by use of protective equipment, but the
danger of minor mishaps becoming fatal remains great.
A basic throw of 1 0+ to avoid a dangerous situation applies
whenever any non-ordinary maneuver is attempted while
wearing a vacc suit (including running, jumping, hiding,
jumping untethered from one ship to another, or other such
activity). Allow a OM of +4 per level of expertise. When
such an incident occcurs, it may be remedied by any
character with vacc suit skill (including the character in
danger) on a throw of 7+; OMs: per level of expertise, +2; if
no expertise, -4. Battle dress and combat armor are special
forms of armored vacc suit and require at least vacc suit-1
to wear at all.
Vehicle: The individual is skilled in the operation, use,
and maintenance of a specific type vehicle commonly
available in society.
The character immediately selects one vehicle from one
of the following groups and gains one level of skill in that
specific type. The groups available are: Aircraft (select
Helicopter, Propeller-driven Fixed Wing, or Jet-driven
Fixed Wing), Grav Vehicle, Tracked Vehicle, Wheeled
Vehicle, and Watercraft (select Small Watercraft, Large
Watercraft, Hovercraft, or Submersible). In the case of
Aircraft and Watercraft, other similar vehicles within the
group may be operated by the individual at skill level minus
1. Vehicle skill is used by characters for operation and as a
OM against accident, and may also be used for assistance in
repairing and maintaining a vehicle.

The Traveller Book
OTHER SKILLS
The above list of skills is certainly not exhaustive.
Additional skills may be encountered in other areas of
Traveller, especially for additional weapons or career types.
Creating New Skills: The chapter on experience indicates
methods by which an individual can learn additional skills
after he or she begins actively adventuring. Those rules also
cover the requirements for creating a new skill not other·
wise detailed in the Traveller rules. For example, if a new
weapon is developed (perhaps a laser pistol ), a new skill
would be required to enable its use.
Default Skills: Often, some characters will have no skills
appropriate to a given situation. A journey across a vacuum
plain may be called for. and no one has vacc suit skill. In
such cases, the referee may indicate that all individuals not
otherwise skilled have vacc suit·O. A level of 0 for a skill
indicates that the individual can undertake ordinary activ i·
ties, but is not experienced enough to try dangerous activi·
t ies or fancy actions. Level-0 indicates an orientation to the
skill by an experienced person; it should not be taken as a
stepping stone to level-1. Skills appropriate for level-0 are:
air/ raft, ATV, forward observer, steward, vacc suit, and
weapons.
Maximum Skills: As a general rule of thumb, a character
may have no more skills (or total of levels of skills) than
the sum of his or her intelligence and education. For
example, a character with UPP 77894A would be restricted
to a total of 13 combined skills and levels of skills. This
restriction does not applv to level -0 skills.
MUSTERING OUT BENEFITS
In addition to the skills acquired while actually in
service, the following skills and substantial rewards can be
acquired through the mustering out procedures.
Retirement Pay: Any character who leaves the service at
the end of the fifth or later term of service is considered to
have retired, and receives retirement pay. This pension is
paid at the beginning of each year, effective upon leaving
the service, and may be collected at any class A or B
starport. The table indicates the rate of pay, which is
dependent on the character's total terms of service. Service
beyond the eighth term adds Cr2000 per additional term.
Retirement pay is not available to characters who have
served in the scout or the other service.
Travel Allowances: The mustering out procedure makes
a variety of benefits available which may generally be called
travel allowances. Such allowances take three basic forms :
money, passages, and Travellers' Aid.
Money: The cash table indicates specific amounts of
money which become available. Some portion of the
money should be considered severance pay or life's savings,
the remainder is a travel allowance.
Passages: The skills and benefits table includes passages,
or tickets, for travel. They are acquired in blank, and
represent one passage, or trip, between one world and
the next world visited by the starship. They are available in
three forms : high passage, middle passage, and low passage.
Passages may be retained and used as needed, or they may
be cashed in at 90% of their face value.
-High Passage includes first class accommodations and
Characters
excellent cuisine, and allows up to one ton of baggage. High
passage costs Cr10,000 when purchased.
- Middle Passage includes second class accommodations
(although still of reasonably good qual ity) and passable
food and drink, and allows up to 100 kilograms of baggage.
The passenger is expected to tend to his or her own affairs
(maid service, laundry, cleaning, etc.) during the voyage.
Middle passage costs Cr8000 when purchased, and is subject
to stand-by conditions; the ticket holder may be bumped if
a high passenger appears (the middle passage ticket being
returned in such cases).
- Low Passage involves travel in cryogenic capsules (cold
sleep, or suspended animation), and the traveller is unconscious
for the course of the journey. A character does not
age while in cold sleep. Because of the intrinsic dangers of
this method of travel, a basic throw of 5+ applies when the
journey is over and the low passenger is revived. Failure of
the throw results in death ; a DM of +1 is allowed if there is
an attending medic-2 or better, OM -1 if the low passenger
has endurance of 6 or less. Low passage costs Cr1000 if
purchased, and includes a baggage allowance of 10 kilograms.
Travellers' Aid: The Travellers' Aid Society is a private
organization which maintains hostels and facilities at all
class A and B starports in human space. Such facilities are
available (at reasonable cost) to members and their guests.
Travellers' Aid Society membership may be acquired
upon mustering out while using the benefits table. Once
this benefit is achieved, further receipt of the benefit
has no effect; membership may be achieved only once per
character. Receipt of membership in the Travellers' Aid
Society upon mustering out may be construed as a reward
for heroism or extraordinary service to the Society, rather
than an official benefit of the service.
Membership in the Society may also be purchased. Such
purchase involves avoidance of a "blackball" (throw 4+ to
avoid), and (if accepted) payment of an initiation fee of
Cr1 ,000,000. Only one application per person is allowed.
Membership is for the life of a character, and is not trans·
ferrable. The Travellers' Aid Society invests its membership
fees and other income; it uses its capital and return to
provide benefits to its members. Every two months, it pays
dividends in the form of one high passage to each member.
This passage may be used, retained, or sold.
Material Objects: The mustering out procedure makes
two types of material objects available: weapons and
starships.
Weapons: The benefits table indicates as results blade or
gun; in such cases, a character may choose any weapon in
the category. If, while mustering out, the same benefit is
received again, the character has the option of taking
another example of the same weapon, selecting a different
weapon, or taking the benefit as +1 in skill in the weapon
previously received. For example, the benefit blade entitles
the character to select any blade weapon, and he chooses
cutlass. On the next benefit roll, he again receives blade as a
benefit. At this point, he could select a different blade
(perhaps foil), choose cutlass again (giving him two cutlasses),
or elect to take expertise in the weapon he has
already received (giving an expertise of cutlass-1 ). Expertise

Characters
may only be taken in a weapon received as a benefit.
Starships: Two types of starships are available as muster·
ing out benefits: type S scout/couriers and type A free
traders. Each is more fully explained in Starship Design
and Construction.
The type A free trader is a 200-ton cargo vessel equipped
to handle both freight and passengers. Receipt of this ship
as a benefit confers possession of the ship, but also liability
for the monthly payments (about Cr150,000) for the next
forty years. Fuel, crew, and other expenses must also be
handled by the character. If the ship benefit is received
more than once, each additional receipt is considered to
represent actual possession of the ship for a ten-year period.
The ship is thus ten years older, and the total payment term
is reduced by ten years. It is possible for a character to own
a ship, free and clear, by successively rolling the ship
benefit five t imes (once to obtain it, and four times to pay
off the four 10-year sequences of payment). The ship is also
forty years old.
The typeS scout/courier is a 100-ton dispatch vessel of a
type very common within human space. It is the pol icy of
the scout service to make available such surplus scout shipS
to selected individuals on a reserve basis. The vessels are
(hopefully) put to good use while they are not required in
service, and both the ship and its pilot are available for
recall to duty when needed. Only one scout ship may be
acquired by a character; further receipt of this benefit
results in no further effect. Possession of the scout ship is at
the pleasure of the scout service, and it cannot be sold or
mortgaged by the character. The ship may be used for travel,
limited commerce, or pleasure. Fuel is free at scout
bases. Maintenance is free at the scout bases at class B
starports. The character is responsible for all other costs
(berthing, upkeep, and crew costs) as the ship is used.
Characteristic Alterations: Finally, the skills and benefits
tables makes provision for some characteristic alterations.
These tend to be increases in education or intelligence, and
are applied to the character immediately.
A NOTE ON GENDER AND RACE
Nowhere in these rules is a specific requirement established
that any character (player or non-player) be of a
specific gender or race. Any character is potentially of any
race and of either sex.
FORMATS
Characters may be referred to in a variety of ways. The
simplest involves an identification of the character's occupation
or name, followed by the UPP (universal personality
profile). For example, a non-player character may be introduced
as Arlent Streen, businessman, 895678.
When more detail is needed, or if one wishes to be more
precise, the following format should be used. The first line
indicates rank, service, UPP, age, and can include name and
noble title if desired. The second line shows terms served in
the prior career, and current credit balance for the individual.
The third line shows skills (and may take as many
lines as are required). The last lines show personal
possessions of any importance for the character. Other
details may be recorded as well.

The following example is given to illustrate the process
of character generation. Actual die throws are shown in
brackets, as are comments on the application of game rules.
Die modifications are labelled DM.
Alexander Lasce/les Jamison. Having just finished
school, Jamison sets out to win his fortune in the universe.
Taking stock of himself and his personal qualities [generate
all six personal characteristics; he rolls, consecutively, 6, 8,
8, 12, 8, 9) he soon decides that his UPP of 688C89 adapts
him best for the merchant service. He visits his local starport,
checks out the situation [required roll of 7+ to enlist,
with a OM of +2 allowed for his intelligence of greater than
6; he rolls 5 (+2=7)], and just barely manages to convince a
merchant captain to let him sign on.
First Term: During his first term of service [survival roll
required is 5+, with a DM of +2 allowed for intelligence; he
rolls 11 (+2=13) I he faces no great dangers, merely the
humdrum of day-to-day events. His application for a
commission [required roll of 4+, DM of +1 allowed for
intelligence; he rolls 7(+1=8)) is a mere formality. As a 4th
officer, he proves hard-working and efficient [promotion
roll required is 10+, with a DM of +1 for intelligence; he
rolls 10 (+1 =11)]. and is quickly promoted one rank. 3rd
Officer Jamison clearly feels that he has found his place in
life, and decides that he would like to continue in service
[reenlistment roll of 4+ required, no OMs; he rolls 7) and
reenlists. He has become eligible for four skills during this
term of service [two for the initial term, one for obtaining a
commission, and one for being promoted]. The work as 4th
officer was, at times, strenuous [Table 1, roll 1 = + 1
strength) but he certainly developed his muscles. While

The Traveller Book
learning the details of his job and dealing with people
[Table 1, roll 5= blade combat] he learns to handle a
dagger. Routine operations [Table 2, roll 2= vacc suit]
require that he learn to handle himself in a vacuum suit.
Finally [Table 2, roll 5= electronics]. he takes an ele·
mentary course in electronics.
Second Term: The rapidly maturing Jamison suddenly
finds himself faced with some of the dangers of the merchant
service [survival throw required is 5+, with a OM of
+2 allowed for intelligence; he rolls 3, which is the lowest it
is possible to roll and still survive (+2=5) 1, possibly a pirate
raid. He does stay alive, however. His continued efficiency
(promotion throw of 10+ with a OM of +1 for intelligence;
he rolls 12 (+1=13)] gains him his desired promotion to
2nd officer. He signs on for a third term of service [reenlistment
throw of 4+ required, no OMs; he throws 6] and
is accepted. He is eligible for two skills this term [one for
service and one for his promotion]. He goes on a physical
fitness kick [Table 1, roll 3= +1 endurance] and learns to
better defend himself [Table 2, roll 4= gun combat] using
the small body pistoL
Third Term: Jamison's third term is rather uneventful
[survival throw of 5+, DM of +2 for intelligence; he rolls 9
(+2=11 )]. Unfortunately [promotion roll of 10+ required,
OM +1 for intelligence; he rolls 8 (+1 =9) 1. he fails the
examination for 1st officer by two points, and does not
receive a promotion. Determined to succeed, he reenlists
[reenlistment roll of 4+ required, no OMs; he rolls 10] . He
is eligible for one skill [Table 2, roll 5= electronics] and
studies an advanced course in electronics to increase his
knowledge.
Fourth Term: Things go right in the fourth term for
Jamison. Facing little danger [survival throw of 5+ required,
DM +2 for intelligence allowed; he rolls 7 (+2=9)].
he also passes his 1st officer exam [promotion throw of
10+ required, DM +1 allowed for intelligence; he throws 12
(+1=13)] easily, receiving his promotion and an automatic
pilot-1 expertise. Reenlisting again, he begins a fifth term of
service [reenlistment roll of 4+ required, no OMs; he rolls
7] . He is eligible for two skills this term. He trains himself
in the martial arts [Table 1. roll 5= blade combat]. choosing
the cutlass and [Table 2, roll 4= gun combat] the submachinegun.
Finally, this being the end of his fourth term,
Jamison is (for the first time) susceptible to aging [saving
throws for strength (8+), dexterity (7+), and endurance
(8+) are made; he rolls 12, 7, and 9, resulting in no
changes].
Fifth Term: Beginning his fifth four-year hitch [survival
roll of 5+ required, DM +2 for intelligence; he rolls 7
(+2=9) 1, he stands for promotion [promotion roll of
10+ required, DM +1 for intelligence; he rolls 10 (+1=11)]
and makes captain. At this point [reenlistment throw of 4+
required, no OMs allowed; he rolls 3]. the service falls on
hard times, and notifies Jamison that it will no longer
require his services after the current term . He is eligible to
retire (with a pension of Cr4000 per year). His service
entitles him to two final skills. He studies [Table 4, roll 5=
pilot] to improve his piloting skill, and [Table 3, roll 3=
electronics] continues his interest in electronics. Age also
begins to take its toll [throw for strength (8+), dexterity
Characters
(7+). and endurance (8+); he rolls 9, 6, and 11, resulting in
the reduction of his dexterity by one point] with a slight
decrease in his health.
Mustering Out: Having completed twenty years of active
duty in the merchant service, Captain Jamison is eligible for
a variety of service benefits [five rolls on the tables for
terms served, plus two by virtue of his rank; in addition, he
is allowed +1 on all rolls on the benefits table]. He receives
[cash table, roll 4= Cr20,000] a severance bonus of
Cr20,000, [benefits table, roll 5 (+1 =6)= +1 education] an
educational benefit, [benefits table, roll 6 (+1 =7)= merchant
ship] possession of a merchant ship, [benefits table,
roll 2 (+1=3)=middle passage] a travel allowance, [benefits
table, roll 6 (+1=7)= merchant ship] credit for participation
in the ship acquisition program, [benefits table, roll 6
(+1 =7)= merchant ship] credit for more participation in the
ship acquisition program, [benefits table, roll 6 (+1 =7)=
merchant ship] and more credit for participation in the
ship acquisition program. Jamison has apparently been
putting much of his salary and ship profits into a continuing
program dedicated to acquiring a ship; now he has
one, and thirty years of the forty year payment scheaule
have already been paid off.
Alexander Lascelles Jamison is now 38 years old, a
retired merchant captain, with a pension of Cr4000 P.El!
year, and a healthy cash balance. His single middle passage,
useless to him as a shipowner, has been converted to c.ash
(Cr7,200). Considering that the merchants forced him out
of the service at the peak of his career, he has some slight
resentment against the merchant service.

Personal Combat
As adventurers journey through the cities and the wilds of the worlds they visit, they will encounter beings of many
kinds, some wild, some intelligent, some violent. At times, the only way such encounters can be dealt with is by force.
In order to resolve such encounters, the following combat system is provided.
This Traveller personal combat system is as important for what it shows as for what it allows. Any player who under·
stands the system is automatically in a position to make reasonable decisions about when to stand and fight, and when to
prudently run away. Understanding the system gives the individual an insight into the probabilities of surviving any specific
encounter.
BASIC COMBAT CONCEPT
This combat system is intended to cover situations
where a party of adventurers (of one or more characters)
encounters a party of people or a group of beasts, and
violence is offered by either side. The actual circumstances
of each encounter are governed by the referee, in accor·
dance with the rules in the chapter on encounters. Those
rules provide for the likelihood of encounters and for the
basic reaction of the other party in response to the encounter.
Combat is based on successive attacks by each character
involved (blows if brawling, swings with blade weapons, and
shots with guns). A basic throw of 8+ is required in every
case to obtain a hit; that throw is subject to die modifications
(OMs) for such considerations as range between the
two parties, attacker and defender expertise in the weapons
they are using, the types of weapons used, surprise, and
other factors. If a hit is obtained, wounds are inflicted
based on the type of weapon which made the hit.
Each combat round lasts 15 seconds. Combat continues
until one party is vanquished, flees, dies, or surrenders.
ENCOUNTERS
Specific encounters with beings of various types are
called for by the referee, by pre-generated encounter tables
(detailed in the chapter on encounters), or by the situation.
Each encounter can be defined by the questions Who or
What? How Many? Why? How? When? and Where?
Who or What? The referee should detail the identity of
the encountered individuals (Who? in the case of intelligent
beings; What? in the case of beasts). For individuals, the
referee should know the UPP (from the chapter on character
generation), plus any skills, weapons, and other data
necessary for the encounter. Such data can be generated on
the spot, derived from pre-generated lists or tables, or
simply faked, depending on how important it is. For beasts,
the referee should know the details of the animal (from the
chapter on animal encounters), including wound and death
points, weaponry, armor, and reactions. The data can be
taken from animal encounter tables or generated on the
spot.
How Many? The number of encountered individuals or
animals should be determined. In some cases, an encounter
table may indicate a precise number, or a die roll may be
called for.
Why? The referee should determine a reasonable motivation
for the encounter. For people, it may range from
rowdyism or robbery, to protection of territory; for animals,
it may involve search for food, fear, bad temper,
or protection of young.
How? The referee should determine the detai ls of the
encounter, to include specific situation, transport available,
and relative disposition of each side.
When? The precise time should be determined, which
in turn affects lighting, weather, and other conditions.
Where? The referee should determine the specifics of
terrain, including terrain type (generally already known),
specific type of terrain within the terrain type (including
details of possible cover and concealment). and any other
pertinent facts.
The referee should not present all of this information to
the players in one lump. They should be told precisely what
they can see or otherwise determine. As the encounter progresses,
additional details may unfold.

COMBAT PROCEDURE
1. Determine the facts of the encounter.
A. Which party has surprise?
B. Initial encounter range?
C. Escape or avoidance?
2. Begin combat round.
A. Individual movement status.
B. Individual targets and attacks.
1) Attacker's OMs.
2) Defender's OMs.
C. If attack succeeds, determine wounds inflicted at

D. Roll for morale if unit has taken 25% casualties.
E. Begin a new combat round (go to 2 above).
3. When combat ends, attend to the wounded and
regroup forces.
INITIAL ENCOUNTER PROCEDURE
Once an encounter occurs, and it appears to require
violence, the combat procedure is used to determine the
resolution of combat. Surprise, encounter range, and escape
or avoidance are determined and executed only once per
encounter. The combat round is performed cyclically until
the combat is concluded.
Surprise: Surprise is possible for either party, and the
element of surprise gives an advantage both in attacking and
in avoiding the enemy. Roll one die for each party: if one
party has a die roll of three or more greater than the other
party, the higher rolling party has achieved surprise. OMs
are allowed for each party depending on expertise and
situation, as shown in the surprise OM table.
Only one party can achieve surprise, and it is possible
that neither party will achieve surprise. If no surprise is
achieved, both parties are considered to be aware of each
other at the range of the encounter.
A party with the element of surprise may elect to avoid
contact with the other party; see escape and avoidance.
A party with the element of surprise may attack with
surprise swings, blows, and shots until surprise is lost. The
endurance rule contains the definition of surprise blows.
Surprise is lost when a member of the other party gives the
alarm in some manner. All unsilenced shots will alert the
enemy to an attack; silenced pistols, laser weapons, and all
guns in vacuum do not make any noise when fired. Any
character who is hit but not rendered unconscious will
make sufficient noise (probably a scream) to raise the
alarm. If the alarm is not raised in this manner, there
is a chance (throw 9+ for it to occur) that an unattacked
comrade in the defending party will see the person fall and
give the alarm. Surprise continues until it is lost, and may
thus continue indefinitely. Once surprise is lost, normal
combat begins.
Because all attacks (shots, blows, and swings) are made
simultaneously, all members of the attacking party may
each make one attack as a surprise if the party has surprise.
If surprise is not lost, each member of the party may make
another surprise attack. This continues until surprise is lost.
Because the attacks are simultaneous, everyone completes
their surprise attacks even if one of them results in the loss
of surprise.
Game Designers' Workshop
Range: Encounters initially occur at any one of five
ranges: close, short, medium, long, or very long. The
specific initial range of an encounter is dependent on the
referee's specific statement, or on a two-dice roll using the
encounter range table. Throws on the range table are
subject to OMs from the terrain OM table. In essence, the
OMs take into account the altered probabilities of specific
encounter ranges in differing terrain types. An encounter at
close range is much less likely on a prairie than in a city, for
example. Determine the OM from the terrain OM table
and apply it to a two-dice roll on the encounter range
table. The result indicates the range at which the two
parties encounter. The distance equivalents of the ranges
used in combat are given in the range table.
Escape and Avoidance: Encountering parties may
attempt to escape from, or avoid contact with, an en·
counter. A party which has achieved surprise may always
avoid an encounter by so stating. Non-player character
parties which have surprise and are outnumbered will avoid
an encounter on a throw of 7+ (no OMs). If two parties
encounter without surprise, either may attempt to escape
immediately (before any combat or contact occurs). Roll
9+ to escape (OM allowed based on range: -1 if close or
short range, +1 if medium range, +2 if long range, +3 if very
long range). A non-player character party will attempt to
escape at the option of the referee, based on the situation.
Animals operate under different rules, as explained in the
chapter on animal encounters.
Once contact or combat begins, a party may leave the
field of battle only through movement.
THE COMBAT ROUND
Combat is resolved in rounds, each representing approxi·
mately 15 seconds of real time. Within each round, each
individual character, non-player character, and animal is
allowed an opportunity to move and to attack. Each may
be attacked by one or more enemy characters, non-player
characters, or animals. Once all individuals in the battle
have been provided the opportunity to attack, the combat
round is over, and the next combat round begins.
Generally, all individuals perform their movement first,
followed by their attacks.
MOVEMENT
For movement, distances are measured in range bands,
each representing approximately 25 meters. The range band
table gives the size of each of the combat ranges in range
bands. For example, a character four range bands away
from another character is at long range with respect to the
other character.
In order to provide a simple display of ranges in an
encounter, it is suggested that they be mapped out on a
line grid (as illustrated on the charts page). Ordinary lined
paper serves this purpose quite well. Each band on the grid
represents one range band. At the beginning of an en·
counter, markers representing each of the members of the
encountering party and those encountered are placed in
bands separated by a distance corresponding to the encounter
distance. In subsequent rounds, characters may
move to close or open the range.

The Traveller Book
Close and short range are each less than a complete range
band in size. To indicate that two characters are at close
range, place their markers touching each other. All other
characters in the same range band are at short range.
Characters may move one band per combat round if
walking or two if running; animals may move faster, as
covered in the chapter on animal encounters.
The line grid is intended to provide a simplified way of
taking care of range determination and sacrifices some
realism for the sake of play ease. The referee may choose to
expand this system to a square or hexagonal grid in order to
take maneuver and actual position into account.
Before each combat round, each character must state his
or her movement status. The four possible movement
statuses are evade, close range, open range, and stand. In
addition, the individual may be walking (at ordinary
speed), running (at double speed), or riding in a vehicle.
Evade: A combatant, at any range, may state evade as a
status. The person may not make any attack (no swings,
blows, or shots are allowed) during the combat round and
may not use his weapon to parry or block (see Expertise);
he or she receives an advantageous OM in the defense, based
on range from the attacker (-1 if at short or close range, -2
if at medium range, -4 if at long or very long range).
Close Range: A combatant may elect to move closer to
the enemy during the combat round. Normally characters
may walk, moving one range band per combat round, or
run (or ride animals or vehicles) at approximately double
speed. Running is an expenditure of energy and is counted
as a combat blow (reducing total endurance points and prohibiting
the character from making any swing or blow
attacks that round) ; see the endurance rule. Moving from
short to close range is counted as moving one range band.
Open Range: A combatant may move away from the
enemy by opening range in much the same manner as he
would close range. However, he may move from close
range to one band away in one move without running.
Stand: A combatant may elect not to move.
All movement is performed simultaneously. If parties
consist of more than one member, each member may
decide what his movement will be for the round. Any
character who moves more than 20 bands away from the
nearest enemy character is out of range and has escaped.
COMBAT RESOLUTION
Combat is resolved in a series of attacks represented by
dice throws made by the combatants. A series of such
throws (where each participating individual capable of
combat action performs it or elects not to) is a combat
round. Combat rounds continue until the battle is resolved
with defeat of one party through rout, death, or surrender.
Basic Required Throw: During each combat round, each
combatant selects a member of the opposing party as a
target. A basic throw of 8+ is required to hit the target. A
hit then calls for determination of wounds inflicted.
The basic throw of 8+ is subject to a variety of appli·
cable die modifiers, including armor/weapons relation,
range, strength of attack (combat or weakened blows),
movement status, attacking and defending expertise, and
other aspects. The weapon matrix indicates weapon/armor
Personal Combat
relation; the range matrix indicates range effects; the
weapon table indicates the effects of strength and dexterity
and of weakened blows. Other OMs are called for by
later sections of these rules.
All OMs to the basic throw to hit are cumulative, being
added together and then applied to the basic throw. It is
important to remember that adding negative numbers
(OMs) is subtracting (3+1 =4; 3+ -1 =2; -3+ -1 =-4).
Roll two dice and modify by the OM created; if the
modified result is 8 or greater, the attack has achieved a hit
on the target. If a hit is achieved, the wound column on the
range matrix must be consulted to determine the extent of
the wounding which has occurred.
Wounding and Death: The wound column indicates the
amount of damage which has been inflicted on the target if
a hit is achieved, and is dependent on the type of weapon
used (not the strength of the character or of the blow) . The
abbreviation used in the wound column is a capital D,
meaning die or dice. The number before the D indicates the
number of dice to be thrown : thus 30 means that the
wound has inflicted hits equal to the throw of three dice.
Wound points are applied to the target's (defending
character's) strength, dexterity, and endurance on a temporary
basis. Each die rolled (for example, each of the two
dice rolled in a result of 20) is taken as a single wound or
group of hits, and must be applied to a single characteristic.
The wounded player may decide which physical characteristic
receives specific wound points in order to avoid or
delay unconsciousness for as long as possible.
The first wound received by any character, however, can
be sufficient to stun or daze him or her, and is handled
differently. This first wound is applied to one of the three
physical characteristics (strength, dexterity, or endurance)
determined randomly. If that characteristic is reduced to
zero, then any remaining hits are then distributed to the
other physical characteristics on a random basis. As a result,
first blood may immediately incapacitate or even kill.
When any one characteristic is reduced to zero by
wounds, the character is rendered unconscious. When two
have been reduced to zero, the character has been seriously
wounded. When all three have been reduced to zero, the
character is dead. Once a characteristic has been reduced to
zero, further points may not be applied to it; they must be
applied to other (non-zero) characteristics.

Personal Combat
Unconscious characters (with at least one characteristic
reduced to zero) recover consciousness after ten minutes
(40 combat rounds) with all three physical characteristics
temporarily placed at a value half way between full strength
and the wounded level . The individual is considered to have
sustained minor wounds. For example, a character with a
strength of 8 who is wounded to a strength of 4 (and
rendered unconscious through the zeroing of another
characteristic) becomes strength 6 when he regains consciousness,
and remains so until recovered. Round fractions
against the character. A return to full strength for the
character requires medical attention (a medical kit and an
individual with at least medical-1 skill) or three days of
rest.
Unconscious characters with two characteristics reduced
to zero are considered seriously wounded and recover
consciousness after three hours. Their characteristics
remain at the wounded level (or 1, whichever is higher) .
Recovery is dependent on medical attention (a medical
facility and an individual with medical-3 skill ; recuperation
to full strength without medical attention is not possible) .
For example, in a firefight, three adventurers (each with
UPP 777777) are hit by rifle fire. A rifle inflicts 30 hits.
The attacker is unlucky against Adventurer One and rolls 1,
1, 1. Because this is One's first wounding in the combat, all
three hits are applied against one characteristic, and the
referee, rolling randomly, appl ies the hits against strength.
Adventurer One is temporarily reduced to UPP 477777 for
wounding purposes only. Adventurer Two fares less well .
The attacker rolls 6, 3, 4. Again, because this is Two's first
wounding of the combat, all hits are applied against one
characteristic (a die roll applies them against his strength).
Adventurer Two's strength is reduced to 0, absorbing the
first die and 1 hit from the second; the remaining hits from
the second die and all of the third die are applied randomly
to his other two physical characteristics (two more die rolls
apply 2 hits to endurance and 4 hits to dexterity). Two's
temporary UPP is now 054 777; he is unconscious. Adventurer
Three fares worst of all. The rifle fire die rolls are 6, 6,
6. All hits are randomly applied to his dexterity, reducing it
to zero after absorbing the first die and 1 hit from the
second. The remaining hits from the second die and all of
the third die are applied randomly again, both against his
strength; the remaining 5 hits from the second die and 2
hits from the third die reduce strength to zero. The remaining
4 hits from the third die are applied to his only remaining
characteristic, endurance. Adventurer Three is seriously
wounded with a temporary UPP 003777.
THE EFFECTS OF CHARACTERISTICS
Personal characteristics can affect combat, being the
source of die modifications based on weapons and the
duration of the battle. Wounds do not affect characteristics
as they are used to influence blows, swings, or shots. For
example, a still-conscious character with strength reduced
from 9 to 7 would still function as if he had strength 9.
However, once wounds bring a characteristic to zero, the
individual is unconscious, and characteristics are of little
use.
Strength: The efficiency of various blows and swings
Game Designers' Workshop
(but not of shots) is dependent on personal strength. The
weapons table indicates both a required strength level and
an advantageous strength level for all blade and brawling
weapons. A character using a specific weapon who does not
have strength equal to or greater than the required strength
level for that weapon is subject to the negative OM (applied
to the basic throw to hit) stated in the weapons table. For
example, a character with strength 5 does not meet the
required strength of 7 for the cutlass, and if using that
weapon is subject to a OM of -2.
A character of great strength, equal to or greater than
the advantageous strength level stated for a specific weapon
being used, is eligible for a positive OM (applied to the basic
throw to hit) given in the table. For example, a character
with strength 11 or greater is allowed a OM of +2 when
using the cutlass.
Dexterity: The accuracy of shots is dependent on the
dexterity of the character firing the weapon. In a manner
similar to the effect of strength on swings and blows, the
weapons table indicates the required and advantageous
dexterity levels for guns, and shows the positive and negative
OMs which should be applied to the basic throw to hit.
Endurance: The number of blows and swings which may
be made, and their impact, is dependent on endurance.
Shots are unaffected by endurance, and an individual may
make as many shots as ammunition is available. For this
purpose, all blows and swings may be classed into one
of four classes: surprise, combat, weakened, and special.
Surprise blows and swings are completely unrestricted;
as long as the attacking character retains the element of
surprise, he or she may make surprise blows and swings
without limit (but only one per combat round).
Combat blows and swings are the ordinary attacks made
in the course of battle after surprise is lost. A character may
make a number of combat blows and swings which does not
exceed his endurance; a character with endurance 9 may
make 9 combat blows. Once this allowance has been used
up, the character may make no more combat blows until he
has rested for at least thirty minutes.
Weakened blows and swings are those attacks made after
the combat blow and swing allowance has been used up.
Each weakened blow or swing is subject to the negative OM
indicated in the weapons table. Any number of weakened
blows and swings may be made. To conserve strength, a
character may elect to make any blow or swing weakened,
and thus not have it counted against his endurance lim it.
Special blows and swings are allowed in situations in
which strength would not normally be a factor, such as
against an unconscious opponent. Special blows and swings
are not weakened, and may be made at any appropriate
time without affecting the endurance limit.
Note that a character is allowed only a specific number
of swings and blows by his endurance characteristic, and
that only one blow or swing may be made per combat
round. The number of blows and swings is based on the
individual's endurance at the beginning of the combat
encounter; wounds suffered during the encounter do not
reduce the total possible swings and blows, but wounds
suffered prior to the encounter which reduce endurance
will reduce the allowance accordingly. The total allowance

The Traveller Book
for swings and blows applies to all such attacks, regardless
of whether the character shifts from brawling to blade
combat or back. Gun combat is not affected by endurance.
EXPERTISE
A character's expertise or skill in a weapon can affect
personal combat in both the attack and the defense.
Attacking: The level of expertise in a specific weapon is
used as a positive OM on the basic throw to hit. If the
character changes the weapon being used, then the expertise
for the new weapon is used in combat.
Parrying: A character may use his expertise level in his
brawling or blade weapon as a negative OM when engaged
in brawling or blade combat (i.e. when using a brawling or
blade weapon against an enemy also using such a weapon).
The character is considered to be blocking or parrying his
enemy's blow. Obviously, only blows or swings may be
blocked, not shots. A long gun such as a rifle or carbine
(but not a pistol) may be used to parry; if so, it is treated as
a brawling weapon (a cudgel) . A weapon may be used both
to attack and parry in the same round.
Untrained Weapon Usage: Any character using a weapon
in which he or she has no training is subject to a penalty of
-5 when attacking and +3 when defending. All player
characters automatically have an expertise of zero (for
example, carbine-0) in all weapons shown in this book. This
zero value is sufficient to avoid the no-expertise penalty,
but it is not enough to provide a positive OM. Player
characters selecting their weapons should consider the
potential benefits of their strength and dexterity levels and
any OMs that might be available for those characteristics.
WEIGHT
Characters are restricted in the total weight which they
may carry, and may suffer negative effects if they carry
enough weight to become encumbered. Individuals carrying
sufficient weight to become encumbered have their UPP
values temporarily reduced; these reduced UPP values are
used when computing wounds and unconsciousness.
Normal Load: Any character may carry a load equal to
his or her strength characteristic, in kilograms. A person
with strength 12 could carry 12 kilograms. Weapons and
other materials are given weights in grams and kilograms.
Load is calculated by totalling the weight of all relevant
items. Clothing, personal armor, and minor items such as
holsters, scabbards, and belts are not counted. Other items
such as tools, communicators, instruments, rations. and
calculators are described in the chapter on equipment, and
their weight constitutes part of the total load.
Double Load: A character may carry up to twice his or
her strength in kilograms. Someone with strength 6 could
carry 12 kilograms. Encumbered persons are treated as if
their strength, dexterity, and endurance are one less than
normal. For example, a character with a UPP 788953
carrying 12 kilograms of load would be treated as 677953
until such time as at least 5 kilograms have been shed.
Triple Load: A character who is part of a military force
(mercenary unit; combat unit; troop unit) may carry up to
triple his or her strength in kilograms, subject to a reduction
of 2 in strength, dexterity, and endurance.
Personal Combat
Different Gravity: Worlds vary in size and density, and
their gravity varies in proportion. World sizes are explained
in the chapter on worlds. A world of size 8 is assumed to
have normal gravity. Subtract the size of the world on
which the adventurers are from 8 and multiply the result by
12.5%. This indicates the additional load that the character
is capable of carrying, in kilograms.
For example, on a world identified as size 4 (8-4=4;
4x12.5%=50%) a character can carry an additional 50%
load without being considered encumbered. A world
with size 10 (8-10=-2; -2x12.5%=-25%) reduces the
allowable load by 25%.
World sizes assume that the world has normal (Earth)
density; different densities of worlds are possible through
the use of a density constant K (generally assumed to have
a value of 1; determined by the referee). When a density
constant K is in use, multiply the world size by K to
determine the true gravity factor, and use that in determining
load sizes.
MORALE
A party of adventurers which sustains casualties in an
encounter will ultimately break or rout if it does not
achieve victory.
At the point in time when 20% of a party is unconscious
or killed, the party must begin making morale throws. For
an average party, 7+ is the throw to stand, or not break and
run. Valiant parties may have a higher throw. OMs are
allowed: +1 if the party is a military unit; +1 if a leader
(leader skill) is present; +1 if the leader has any tactical
skill; -2 if the leader is killed (for two rounds at least, and
until a new leader takes control); -2 if casualties (unconscious
and dead) exceed 50%.
TYPICAL ACTIONS
It is impossible to accurately predict all possible actions
which can occur in combat. This situation is one reason
why a referee is desirable when combat is to be resolved.
The typical actions table in the combat charts lists a
wide variety of possible actions which are covered by these
37

38
Personal Combat
rules. If other actions are called for, the referee must
adjudicate their results.
WEAPONS USAGE
The following are important to the implementation of
weapons use.
The Combat Charts: The combat charts provide the
information required to resolve combat between individuals
and groups.
Standard Weapons: An array of standard blade weapons
and guns is provided on the combat charts; these weapons
are further detailed and illustrated in the section on combat
equipment.
Non-Standard Weapons: A variety of non-standard
weapons are possible, and may be implemented within this
combat system. In general, such weapons are similar to
those in the system, and are differentiated only in terms of
a positive or negative OM. For example, a pocket knife
is inferior to a dagger, and may be treated as a dagger
minus 1. Dagger minus 1 is subject to a OM of -1 in addition
to all other OMs called for by the combat system. Similarly
a target pistol might be expressed as an automatic pistol
plus 1. Many an imal weapons (claws, teeth, etc.) are treated
as +1 or - 1 in the chapter on animal encounters.
Non-standard armor (especia lly for animals) is treated in
the same way as non-standard weapons.
Square Grid Activity: Many deck plans, floor plans, or
other maps for Traveller are drawn with a square grid,
usually representing squares of 1.5 meters each. If grids of
this or similar scales are used, then changes should be made
to the range band system. Walking speed is 8 squares per
combat round. Running is 16 squares per combat round.
Greater speeds are in multiples of 8 squares per combat
round. Specific activities such as opening doors or hatches
each take one combat round, during which time the individual
should be treated as evading.
COMBAT EQUIPMENT
The weapons and armor used by a character constitute
his or her primary means of achieving goals once logic and
persuasion have failed. Weapons are also essential for
self-defense. These various weapons, weapon accessories,
and armor are described below. Weights are given in grams;
costs are given in credits (Cr). The technological level at
which the weapon is first produced is shown after the
abbreviation TL; tech levels are explained in the chapter on
worlds.
Brawling Weapons: Brawling generally involves found
or easily located weapons which are already at the site of
the brawl. Brawling weapons are effective only at close and
short range. Such weapons are classified as clubs, cost
nothing, and generally weigh from 500 to 3000 gram& (one
die times 500 grams). Pistols may be used as clubs when
brawling. Bottles may be used as clubs (once, then they
become dagger minus 1 ). Animals are equipped with their
own weapons, generally specified in the encounter tables
which specify and define the animal.
Blllde Weapons: The following edged weapons cover the
range of blades which are available. Blade weapons are
effective only at close and short range.
Game Designers' Workshop

The Traveller Book
Dagger (250 grams; Cr10; TL 1 I: A small knife weapon
with a flat, two-edged blade approximately 200mm in
length. Daggers are usually carried in a belt sheath, and less
frequently are concealed in a boot sheath or strapped to the
forearm. Daggers are usually the last weapon of defense,
and worn constantly. Each weighs 250 grams; that weight,
however, does not count against the weight load of the
character as the weapon is worn constantly and comfortably.
Blade (350 grams; Cr50; TL 31: A hybrid knife weapon
with a heavy, flat two·edged blade nearly 300mm in length,
and a semi-basket handguard. Because of the bulk of the
handguard, it is generally carried in a belt scabbard.
Foil (500 grams; Cr100; TL 31: Also called the rapier,
this weapon is a light, sword·like weapon with a pointed,
edged blade 800mm in length, and a basket or cup hilt to
protect the hand. Foils are worn in belt scabbards.
Cutlass (1250 grams; Cr100; TL 3): A heavy, flat-bladed,
single-edged weapon featuring a fu ll basket hilt to protect
the hand. The cutlass is the standard shipboard blade
weapon and usually kept in brackets on the bulkhead near
important locations; when worn, a belt scabbard is used.
Blade length varies from 600 to 900mm.
Sword (1000 grams; Cr150; TL 1) : The standard long·
edged weapon, with a flat, two·edged blade. It may have a
basket hilt or hand protector. A scabbard to carry the
sword may be attached to the belt, or to straps (or a sash)
over the shoulder. Blade length varies from 700 to 950mm.
Broadsword (2500 grams; Cr300; TL 21:. The largest of
the sword weapons, also called the two-handed sword
because it requires both hands to swing. The blade is
extremely heavy, two-edged, and about 1000 to 1200mm
in length. The hilt is relatively simple, generally a cross·
piece only, with little basketwork or protection. When
carried, the boardsword is worn in a scabbard attached to
the belt; less frequently, the scabbard is worn on the back,
and the broadsword is drawn over the shoulder.
Polearms: The following polearms are generally available.
In most cases, they will be in the hands of non·player
characters encountered in the process of an adventure.
Polearms are effective at close and short range.
Bayonet (250 grams; Cr10; TL 3): A knife·like weapon
similar to a dagger or blade. When not attached to a rifle, a
bayonet is treated as a dagger (or blade), carried in a belt
scabbard, and requires dagger (or blade) skill for use to
advantage. When attached to the muzzle of a rifle (only,
not carbine or auto rifle). it transforms the gun into a
polearm, and increases the length of the arm by 200mm.
Spear (2000 grams; Cr10; TL 0) : A long (3000mm)
polearm with a pointed tip, usually of metal. Often made
by the soldier himself, the spear is quite inexpensive.
Pike (3000 grams; Cr40; TL 1): A long (3000 to
4000mml polearm with some form of flat blade tip. Pikes
are commonly carried as weapons by tech level 1 troops.
Halberd (2500 grams; Cr75; TL 2): A quite elaborate
polearm featuring a pointed, bladed tip. This weapon may
be considered to be a combination between a battle ax and
a spear. Halberds are often carried by tech level 2 guards.
Length: 2500mm.
Cudgel (1000 grams; Cr10; TL 0): A basic stick used as a

weapon. Easily obtained from standing trees or through the
use of an unloaded long gun such as a rifle or carbine (laser
weapons are too delicate to be used as cudgels). Length:
1000 to 2000mm.
Guns: The following guns are generally available on
worlds of sufficient tech level; their availability is restricted,
however, by the law level of the specific world. Law levels
are explained in the chapter on worlds. Guns vary in
effective range depending on their specific type; range
limitations are shown on the combat charts.
All of the guns shown in this list (with the exception of
the revolver) are auto·loading weapons. Each automatically
reloads the gun's chamber with a new cartridge after each
shot. Only when the weapon's total capacity is exhausted
must the shooter reload the gun with a new magazine.
Although the revolver is not auto·loading, it also contains
a quantity of ammunition and need not be reloaded until
its ammunition capacity is exhausted.
Unless noted otherwise, the weapons are semi-automatic;
each fires one bullet or shot with each pull of the trigger.
Automatic rif les and submachineguns are full-automatic
with a burst control which allows f iring four shots with
each pull of the trigger. Full automatic fire allows special
effects with higher hit probabilities and potential for group
hits as detailed in the section on special considerations.
The section on special considerations also provides
details on reloading weapons which have run out of ammunition.
Body Pistol (300 grams loaded; Cr 520; TL 7) : A small,
non-metallic semi-automatic pistol designed to evade detection
by most weapon detectors. It fires 5 gram projectiles at
a velocity of 500 to 600 meters per second. A magazine
containing six cartridges is located in the pistol handle.
Body pistol ammunition is not interchangeable with the
Submachinegun
Game Designers' Workshop
ammunition for any other types of guns.
A body pistol can be fitted with a si lencer.
Length: 100mm. Weight, unloaded: 250 grams (a loaded
magazine weighs 50 grams). Base price: Cr500 (one loaded
magazine: Cr20).
Automatic Pistol (1000 grams loaded; Cr210; TL 5):
The basic semi-automatic handgun, firing 9mm caliber
bullets (each weighing approximately 10 grams) at velocities
from 400 to 500 meters per second. A magazine
containing 15 cartridges fits into the handle of the pistol.
Automatic pistol ammunit ion is interchangeable with
submachinegun ammunition (although magazines are not).
An automatic pistol can be fitted with a silencer and a
detachable shoulder stock.
Length: 175mm. Weight, unloaded: 750 grams (loaded
magazine weighs 250 grams). Base price: Cr200 (loaded
magazine: Cr10).
Revolver (1000 grams loaded; Cr155; TL 4) : An older
variety of handgun, the revolver f ires 9mm bullets with
characteristics similar to those fired by the automatic
pistol, but not interchangeable with them. The revolver is
a repeating handgun; it fires one shot with each pull of the
trigger. It is not, however, semi-automatic, depending on
f inger pressure to do the reloading. No magazine is used: six
cartridges are inserted into the revolver individually. Reloading
takes two combat rounds, or one combat round if
the individual foregoes the benefit of evasion.
A revolver can be fitted with a silencer and a detachable
shoulder stock.
Length: 200mm (some versions may be shorter or
longer). Weight, unloaded: 900 grams (weight of six cartridges:
100 grams). Base price : Cr150 (six cartridges
cost Cr5).
Submachinegun (3000 grams loaded; Cr520; TL 5): A
small automatic weapon designed to fire pistol ammunition.
Magazines holding 30 cartridges are inserted into the
weapon forward of the trigger guard or in the pistol grip,
depending on· the design. The gun fires four rounds per pull
of the trigger. Submachinegun ammunition (but not magazines)
is interchangeable with automatic pistol ammunition.
Most submachineguns are equipped with slings to allow
ease of carrying.
Length : 450mm. Weight, unloaded: 2500 grams (loaded
magazine: 500 grams). Base price : Cr500 (loaded magazine:
Cr20).
Carbine (3125 grams loaded; Cr210; TL 5) : A short type
of semi-automatic rifle firing a small caliber round (a 6mm
bullet, weighing 5 grams, at a velocity of 900 meters per
second). A magazine containing ten rounds is inserted into
the underside of the carbine, ahead of the trigger guard.
Carbine ammunition is not interchangeable with any other
type of ammunition.
In essence, a carbine is a short rifle, firing a cartridge of
smaller, lighter caliber. The carbine is a preferred weapon
for individuals who otherwise do not handle firearms. Its
light weight makes it convenient and efficient. A sling
usually allows the carbine to be carried on the shoulder, out
of the way.
A carbine may be fitted with te lescopic or electronic
sights, and with a folding stock.

The Traveller Book
Length: 750mm. Weight, unloaded: 3000 grams (loaded
magazine weighs 125 grams). Base price: Cr200 (loaded
magazine: Cr10).
Rifle (4500 grams loaded; Cr220; TL 5): The standard
semi-automatic military arm, firing a 7mm, 10 gram bullet
at a velocity of approximately 900 meters per second.
Longer and heavier than a carbine, it is also more effective.
Standard equipment includes provisions for attaching a
bayonet and telescopic sights, and a shoulder sling.
A twenty-round magazine is attached to the front of the
trigger guard. Rifle ammunition may al so be used in automatic
rifles; rifle and auto rifle magazines are interchangeable,
and weigh the same.
A r ifle can be fitted with either telescopic or electronic
sights, and with a folding stock.
Length : 1000mm. Weight, unloaded: 4000 grams
(loaded magazine weighs 500 grams). Base price : Cr200
(loaded magazine: Cr20).
Automatic Rifle (5500 grams loaded; Cr1020; TL 6): A
highly refined and tuned version of the rifle, capable of full
automatic fire as well as semi-automatic shots. Normally,
the automatic rifle f ires in bursts of four bullets for each
pull of the trigger. It may be switched to semi-automatic
f ire at the end of a combat round, after all f iring, in which
case it is treated as a rifle until switched back. Ammunition
and magazines are identical to those used for the rifle.
The automatic rifle is equipped wit h a sling (which
allows the weapon to be slung f rom the shoulder while
carried in the ready to f ire position), a bipod, and a muzzle
brake to steady the gun while firing.
Some versions of the automatic rifle are available which
use 100 round belts of ammunition (not usable in rifles,
however). Such belts cost Cr120 (the equivalent of six
loaded magazines) and weigh 2500 grams. Reloading with a
new belt requires three combat rounds.
Length: 1000mm. Weight, unloaded : 5000 grams
(loaded magazine: 500 grams; 100-round belt: 2000 grams).
Base price: Cr1000 (loaded magazine: Cr20; complete
100-round belt: Cr120).
Shotgun (4500 grams loaded; Cr160; TL 4): The basic
weapon for maximum shock effect without regard to
accuracy. The shotgun has an 18mm diameter barrel
and fires shells containing either six 7mm bullets, or one
hundred and thirty 3mm pellets. In each case, the projectiles
weigh a total of 30 grams. Velocity for the projectiles
is about 350 meters per second. A cylindrical magazine
containing 10 shells is inserted under the barrel and parallel
to it; cartridges are then fed automatically into the shotgun
for firing. Reloading consists of replacing the cylindrical
magazine and takes two combat rounds. One shot is fired
for each pull of the trigger.
Magazines measure approximately 350mm long by
20mm in diameter and ar·e quite clumsy to carry.
Shotguns are equipped with a. sling for carrying. They
may be fitted with a folding stock.
Length: 1000mm. Weight, unloaded: 3750 grams
(loaded magazine: 750 grams). Base price: Cr150 (loaded
magazine: Cr10).
Laser Carbine (8000 grams, including power pack;
Cr3500; TL 8) : A lightweight version of the laser rifle,

Laser Rifle
Game Designers' Workshop
firing high energy bolts using current from a backpack
battery/power pack. The laser carbine fires a 2mm beam of
energy, aimed by integrated optic sights. The power pack is
capable of producing 50 shots before it requires recharging.
Recharging requires at least eight hours connected to a high
energy source. The laser carbine is connected to the power
pack by a heavy dvty cable.
Length: 800mm. Weight of carbine: 5000 grams. Weight
of power pack: 3000 grams. Base price: Cr2500 (extra
power pack: Cr1000). Cost of recharge, at commercial
rates: Cr200.
Laser Rifle (10 kilograms, including power pack; Cr
5000; TL 9): The standard high energy weapon, firing high
energy bolts in the same manner as the laser carbine.
Heavier than the laser carbine, the laser rifle is also capable
of longer sustained action, and is constructed somewhat
more sturdily. The power pack can provide 100 shots
before recharging. As in the laser carbine, the laser rifle is
connected to the power pack by a heavy duty cable. Power
packs are not interchangeable between the two weapons.
Length: 1000mm. Weight of rifle: 6000 grams. Weight
of power pack: 4000 grams. Base price: Cr3500 (extra
power packs: Cr1500). Cost of recharge, at commercial
rates: Cr300.
Accessories: The following special accessories are gener·
ally available for the various weapons.
Telescopic Sights (800 grams; Cr200; TL 6) : High·
quality telescopic sights for attachment to rifles and carbines,
for increasing their accuracy, especially at longer
ranges. A rifle equipped with such sights has a DM of +4 to
hit at long and very long ranges. Note that this DM is in
addition to other allowed and required OMs.
Telescopic sights are delicate, however, and may be
jarred out of alignment by any violent action (such as being
left untended in a moving truck, a close explosion, or being
dropped) on a throw of 7+. When the sights go out of
adjustment, the basic throw to hit should not be revealed to
the firer, and he or she will always miss.
Electronic Sights (1500 grams; Cr2000; TL 9) : Electronic
sights with image enhancement and low-light cap·
abilities are available to provide the capability to see
and hit in the dark. Electronics are treated like telescopic
sights for damage and reliability, and function similarly.
Silencer (600 grams; Cr200; TL 6): Devices are available
which will muffle or eliminate the sound of guns firing, but
so far they have proven practical only when applied to
body pistols, revolvers, and automatic pistols. A silencer
attaches to the muzzle of the pistol, increasing its total
length, and making it impossible to holster until the silencer
is removed. Silencers are not interchangeable; one must be
purchased for each specific model of pistol used.
Length: 100 to 300mm. Weight: 500 to 700 grams. Base
price: Cr200.
Shoulder Stocks (1000 grams; Cr75; TL 5) : It is possible
to produce a shoulder stock which may be attached temporarily
to a pistol or revolver, resulting in a crude carbine
arrangement and some greater accuracy at longer ranges.
The overall length of the pistol is increased by the length of
the stock, and the pistol cannot be holstered. Attaching the
stock (or detaching it) requires five combat rounds.

The Traveller Book
Length: 350mm. Weight: 1000 grams. Base price: Cr75.
Folding Stocks (500 grams; Cr100; TL 6) : Carbines,
rifles, and shotguns can be equipped with folding stocks
which make it possible to reduce the overall length of
the weapon by 300mm.
Weight: adds 500 grams to weapon. Base price: Cr100.
Armor and Protection: The following items of armor
and personal protection are generally available. The weight
of personal armor and clothing is assumed to be part of the
character's clothing load and is not affected by the weight
rule. Only one form of personal armor may be worn, except
that reflec may always be worn under clothing or armor.
Jack (Cr50; TL 1): A natural or synthetic leather jacket
or body su it covering the torso and upper arms and legs.
Jack is somewhat better than ordinary clothing or bare skin
when defending against blades; it is worthless against guns.
Mesh (Cr150; TL 7): A jacket or body suit made of
natural or synthetic leather and reinforced with a lining of
flexible metal mesh, similar to chain mail but lighter
and stronger. Mesh reduces or stops penetration by blades
and has some effectiveness against guns; it is ineffective
against laser fire.
Cloth (Cr250; TL 6): A heavy duty body suit tailored
from ball istic cloth. The fabric absorbs impact energy,
distributing the blow over the body of the target and
possibly resulting in bruising. Nevertheless, cloth armor is
almost the best and the most versatile available.
Reflec (Cr1500; TL 10) : Reflective material on a plastic
base can be tailored into a body suit which is ineffective
against most weapons, but superior in defense against laser
fire. Unlike other forms of armor, reflec is worn under
other clothing. Reflec is expensive and often d ifficult to
obtain.
Ablat (Cr75; TL 9): Ablat is a cheap alternative to
reflec, and is fashioned from a material which will ablate
(vaporize) when hit by laser fire. The ablation of the
material carries away the energy of the laser, and protects
the wearer. Continued fire against ablat degrades its effec·
tiveness, but the armor is cheap and easily replaceable.
Ablat also has some value against other forms of attack.
Vacc Suit (Cr10,000; TL 8): The personal vacuum or
space su it is designed to protect the individual from
vacuum, tainted, or noxious atmospheres, and some radiation
situations. It carries its own communicators, oxygen
tanks for six hours, and other basic survival appurtenances.
Use of a vacc suit requires vacc suit-0 or better. It acts as
cloth armor when subject to attacks. Vacc suits are relatively
bulky, and weigh 10 kilograms; the weight counts
against personal weight allowances. This weight is reduced 2
kilograms per tech level as the suit gains increasing sophistication.
For example, a TL 10 vacc suit weighs 6 kilograms,
and a vacc suit at tech level 13+ adds no apparent weight.
Combat Armor (Cr20000; TL 11): Combat armor is a
complete vacc-suit-like array of metal and synthetic armor.
Combat armor is strictly military and not available on the
open market; it is issued to troop units and elite mercenary
battalions. Before combat armor can be worn, the user
must have vacc suit skill-1 or better.
Battle Dress (Cr200,000; TL 13) : The ultimate in
individual protection, battle dress is an advanced and
Personal Combat
powered version of combat armor. Battle dress enhances
the strength and senses of individuals wearing it with
variable feedback personal controls, servo-powered limbs,
and various kinds of electronic assistance. The individual
wearing battle dress is effectively doubled in strength and
given unlimited endurance (for lifting, carrying, and fighting
purposes; not for wounds received) and receives a OM
of +2 for surprise.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
The following are important to the implementation of
weapons use.
Drawing: Weapons are usually carried holstered or slung,
unless the characters specifically state the contrary. A
character attempting to use a holstered or slung weapon in
a combat round is subject to a OM of -3 when drawing.
When two or more people draw against each other (assuming
surprise is not a factor), each rolls two dice and adds his
or her dexterity; the character with the highest modified
throw thus achieves surprise for the purpose of a first shot.
Minor Accessories: Holsters, magazine carriers, belts,
scabbards, cleaning kits, and other accessories are available
for 10% to 20% of the base price of the weapon. They have
effectively no weight (being included in the personal
clothing group). Shoulder holsters conceal pistols in public;
otherwise, pistols are openly carried in hip holsters.
Throwing Blades: Daggers, blades, and bayonets may be
thrown at a target at short range. Throw 18+ to hit; OM
+dexterity, +blade skill, -target evasion OM if evading. If a
hit is achieved, the wound is 20. Retrieval of thrown blades
requires one combat round at close range with the target.
Polearms (spears, pikes, and halberds) may be thrown
using the above procedure, but the thrower must have a
strength characteristic equal to triple the weight of the
thrown weapon.
Throwing a blade or polearm counts as a combat blow or
swing.
Full Automatic Fire: Submachineguns and automatic
rifles fire four round bursts instead of single shots. The
higher ammunition usage results in the hit probabilities
shown on the table (auto rifle uses the rifle row on the
table when firing single shots). In addition, automatic f ire
allows rolling to hit twice against the same target. Finally,
the group hit rule appl ies against companions of the target.
Group Hits By Automatic Fire: Regardless of the
designated target for automatic fire, non-evading individuals
adjacent to the target are also attacked by the burst of
automatic fire. No more than two adjacent targets may be
attacked, but each is the subject of a roll to hit with a OM
of -3, and all other appropriate OMs.
Group Hits By Shotguns: Each shot by a shotgun may
attack up to three individuals adjacent to the original
target, provided they are in a group (herd, pack, band, etc.)
and are each human-sized or smaller. In addition, when
firing against flying targets (winged animals, flying vehicles)
within range, a OM of +2 is allowed.
Coup De Grace: Any gun or blade may be used to
administer a coup de grace and kill an unconscious or
unstruggling individual (person or animal) at close range
in one combat round if the character using the weapon so

Personal Combat
COVER
Targets are considered under cover
if they are behind a solid object which
a shot cannot penetrate (such as a wall,
rock, or heavy bulkhead). A character
who has attacked from a covered
position is allowed a defending OM of
-4 when attacked. If the individual has
not attacked from cover, he or she is
not visible at the moment, and may not
be attacked.
CONCEALMENT
Targets are considered concealed if
they cannot be viewed by an attacker.
If fully concealed, a target cannot be
attacked.
Partial Concealment: A target may
be partially concealed by walls, objects,
atmospheric conditions, or darkness.
ZERO GRAVITY
Individuals in zero gravity may
lose control ; weapons with recoil (all
guns but laser carbine and laser rifle)
have recoil which may disorient an
individual.
Throw 10+ per combat round for
loss in control. OM -4 if firing a wea·
pon, 5 if using a handhold, -6 if performing
a swing or blow, +2 if dex·
terity 9+, additional +2 if dexterity 11 +.
Using a handhold reduces dexterity (for
the above OMs, and for advantageous or
required dexterity) by -4.
loss Of Control: Throw 10+ per
combat round (after losing control) to
regain control. OMs allowed as above,
but handholds and weapons may not be
used.
DARKNESS
Total darkness restricts engagements
to close and short range. Attacks with
guns at greater than short range have
OM -9.
Partial darkness reduces visibility to
medium range; attacks with guns at
greater than medium range are subject
to OM -6.
Electronic sights el iminate negative
OMs due to darkness or poor lighting.
TYPICAL ACTIONS
The following are typical actions
allowed in personal combat.
Run. Walk. Close Range. Open
Range. Stand. Evade. Shoot. Switch
(semi or full auto). Reload. Throw.
Draw. Swing. Hit.

unresisting targets.

The Traveller Book
PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS
The first three characteristics of the
universal personality profile are the
physical characteristics:
Strength
Dexterity
Endurance
WOUNDING AND DEATH
Wounds are applied to the physical
characteristics, temporarily reducing
them for the duration of combat.
Each die rolled for wounds is treated
as a group of hits that should not be
divided; for example, a 1 D result of
5 should be treated as 5 hits to be
applied as one group to one of the
physical characteristics. Select the first
physical characteristic to receive
wounds randomly ; the wounded player
character may select all subsequent
physical characteristics to receive
wounds.
Critical Hits
The first wound received by a
character should be applied in its
entirety to one (randomly determined)
physical characteristic.
Minor Wounds
Any wound points applied to a
character which do not reduce more
than one physical characteristic to zero
are considered minor wounds. The
character is treated as having the reduced
characteristics until medical care
or recovery has taken place.
Unconsciousness
One characteristic reduced to zero
results in unconsciousness for ten
minutes. Upon recovery of consciousness,
any wounded characteristics are
placed midway between their wounded
and full levels; round fractions down.
Serious Wound
Two characteristics reduced to zero
results in a serious wound and unconsciousness
for three hours. Upon recovery
of consciousness, any wounded
characteristics remain at the wounded
level (or at 1, whichever is higher) until
proper medical attention or recovery
procedures are followed.
Death
Three characteristics reduced to zero
results in death for the character. Range Bands
Personal Combat
Medical Care
Minor Wounds: Minor wounds re·
quire a medical kit, skill of medical-1,
and thirty minutes. Without medical
care, recovery requires three days rest.
Serious Wounds: Serious wounds
require a medical facility (local hospital
or aid station, the sick bay of a ship,
etc.), skill of medical-3, and from 5 to
30 days. Without medical care, recovery
is not possible.
Recovery: Recovery returns all characteristics
to their original level.
Drugs: Medical drug may be used to
assist recovery. Medical slow drug may
be used to shorten recovery time to
about one day.
RANGES
Close: In physical contact; touching.
Short: At sword or polearm point;
1 to 5 meters.
Medium: At pistol range; 6 to 50
meters.
Long: At rifle range; 51 to 250
meters.
Very Long: At extreme range; 251
to 500 meters.
Distant: Beyond normal contact;
from 500 to 5000 meters.
Very Distant: Out of sight; from 5
to 50 kilometers.
Regional : 50 to 500 kilometers.
Continental: 500 to 5,000 kilometers.
Planetary: 5,000 to 50,000 kilometers.

Personal Combat
in one combat round if the character using the weapon so
states. Ammunition is expended, but no die rolls are
necessary. A coup de grace may be administered with
hands or brawling weapons using special blows, but die rolls
must be made.
Reloading: Technically, guns reload themselves after
each shot. However, when the magazine capacity of a gun
is exhausted, then the shooter must reload the gun with a
fully loaded magazine. Unless otherwise stated, the process
of reloading a gun with a full magazine takes one combat
round, during which time the shooter is treated as evading.
Revolvers do not use magazines, and so take two combat
rounds (one combat round if not simultaneously evading)
to reload. Laser carbines and laser rifles do not use cartridges;
their power packs must be recharged upon being
exhausted. Such a laser weapon may be returned to service
by replacing the power pack. Recharging a spent power
pack requires approximately an hour at a power source.
Empty magazines are, of course, reusable. Ammunition
for such magazines can be purchased for approximately
half the price of a full magazine. The tedium of reloading
empty magazines requires that it be done at leisure, rather
than in combat. The process takes several minutes for each
magazine.
Laser rifles and laser carbines require recharging of their
power packs at a power source. When done commercially,
there is a cost of Cr200 to Cr300 for the service. Generally,
such power packs can be recharged at a ship's power plant
at no cost.
Armor: With the exception of reflec, no armor may be
worn with another type of armor. If reflec is worn in
conjunction with another armor type and the wearer is
attacked, the better type of armor provides the OM.
Darkness and Night: Poor lighting conditions may
restrict the ability of an individual to see and attack. Total
darkness restricts engagements to close and short range.
Attacks with guns at greater than short range are subject to
DM -9. Partial darkness (moonlit night, distant illumi·
nation, or other weak light sources) reduces visibility range
to medium, and attacks with guns are subject to DM -6.
Electronic Sights eliminate negative OMs due to darkness
or poor lighting.
Cover and Concealment: Cover is any solid object
between an attacker and defender capable of protecting
the defender from a weapon attack. Concealment is any
object that prevents viewing or sighting of the defender.
Cover may also be concealment; concealment is not necessarily
cover.
Game Designers' Workshop
An individual under cover cannot be attacked; an individual
in concealment cannot be attacked unless the attacker
has some reason to shoot into the area.
Individuals who attack from cover become visible and
may themselves be attacked; because they retain partial
cover they are eligible for a defending DM of -4. Individuals
who attack from concealment provide reason to believe
they are present, and may be attacked; because they remain
partially concealed, they are allowed a defending DM of - 1.
Zero Gravity: Virtually all weapons have recoil (except
laser carbines and laser rifles) and in a zero·G environment
this recoil can disorient or render helpless individuals not
trained· to compensate for it. When fighting in a zero-G
environment, any individual has a chance of losing control
of his or her movement/position each combat round.
Throw 10+ to avoid losing control. OMs: -4 if firing a
weapon. +5 if using a handhold. -6 is performing a swing or
blow. +2 if dexterity 9+. Additional +2 if dexterity 11+.
Using a handhold reduces dexterity (for the above OMs and
for required or advantageous dexterity) by -4.
Individuals who lose control may not fire until they have
reoriented themselves and regained control. Roll 10+ in
each subsequent combat round; OMs as above except
handholds and weapons may not be used.
ANTIQUE EQUIVALENTS
Most of the standard gun weapons available to travellers
are based on weapons available in the 1980s. While technology
will certainly progress in the centuries that come, it
will also remain a fact that one of the surest ways to injure
or kill an adversary is to subject him or her to a large dose
of kinetic energy; the simplest way to deliver that energy to
someone is with bullet impact. The guns noted below are
used as the basis for the weapons described, although some
changes have been made in weight and power. Individuals
interested in the capabilities and parameters of the weapons
can use this information as a springboard.

Some weapons such as the laser rifle and laser carbine
are not currently available to 1980's technology. Referees
may feel free to create other weapons (for example, a laser
pistol) to suit the needs and desires of their own Traveller
campaigns.

Travel
Travellers travel. They move between worlds as well as on and over their surfaces. The concept of space travel is vital to
Traveller, if only because it allows adventurers to move from place to exotic place in search of new, interesting, rewarding,
or important activities.
Space travel between worlds is the most important type of travel undertaken by characters. Space travel can be of two
types : interplanetary travel between worlds with in a star system, and interstellar travel between star systems. Starships and
spacecraft are the carriers of goods, cargos, and passengers; individual passages may be purchased, the ships may be hired or
chartered, and for the very rich, ships may be purchased.
Travel has its interests, rewards, and drawbacks. New worlds to be encountered, explored, or avoided are just as far as
the next interstellar jump. Situations ranging from commercial ventures, to quests after unknown artifacts, to military
expeditions are easily found.
INTERPLANETARY TRAVEL
Worlds orbiting the same star are accessible by interplanetary
travel, on ships operated by local entrepreneurs,
or with a variety of small craft. But interplanetary travel
takes long periods of time; since most stellar systems have
only one major world, interplanetary t ravel is infrequent.
Interplanetary travel takes time. The diagram of a
typical interplanetary journey shows the procedure used for
moving between worlds in the same star system. The
travel formulae can be used to determine t ime required (if
distance and acceleration are known), acceleration required
(if distance and time are known), and distance travelled (if
time and acceleration are known). All of the formulae use
the MKS (meters, kilograms, seconds) unit system, and
assume that the ship is undertaking a journey from rest,
that it accelerates continuously to the midpoint of the trip,
and then decelerates to rest again. In addition, several travel
times and travel distances have been pre-<:alculated for
ready reference.
Interplanetary (as opposed to interstellar) travel usually
involves the individual's own vessel or a charter. Scheduled
service is rarely available.
INTERSTELLAR TRAVEL
Worlds orbiting different stars are reached by interstellar
travel, which makes use of the jump drive. Once a starship
moves to a safe distance from a world, it may activate its
jump drive. Jump drives are rated from 1 to 6 : the number
of parsecs which can be travelled in one week. Actually,
making any jump takes about one week, regardless of the
distance travelled. Transit time to 100 diameters from a size
8 world (world sizes are explained in Worlds) takes 5 hours
at 1G.
Commercial starships usually make two jumps per
month. They spend one week in jump, followed by one
week in the star system, travelling from the jump point to
the local world, refuelling, marketing cargo, find ing passengers,
leaving the starport, and proceeding to a jump point
again. The week in the system usually provides some time
for crew recreation and for wandering around the planet.
Non-commercial ships usually follow the same schedule
of one week in jump and one week in a system. If haste is
called for, a ship may refuel immediately and re-jump right
away. This allows the ship to make one jump per week, but
makes no provision for cargo, passengers, or local stops.
Interstellar travel is priced on the basis of accommodations;
prices cover a trip from starport to starport, encompassing
one jump, regardless of length. There are four types
of passage:
High Passage- The best method of travel is called high
passage, which involves first class accommodations and
cuisine. High passengers have the services of the ship's
steward, entertainment, and complete attention to their
comfort. There is a baggage allowance of up to 1,000
kilograms. High passage costs Cr10,000.
Middle Passage- In order for starships to fill their
staterooms with passengers, middle passage is offered on a
standby basis, in the event that not enough high passages
are sold. While middle passengers occupy staterooms
normally similar to those occupied by high passengers, they
do not receive the service or entertainment accorded the
higher paying passengers. In addition, the quality of the
cuisine is rather low. Baggage totalling 100 kilograms is
allowed. Middle passage costs Cr8,000.
49

50
Travel
A middle passenger may be "bumped" and the stateroom
taken by a late arriving high passenger; the middle
passenger's ticket is returned, but no other compensation is
made. (The bumped individual could, of course, then buy a
high passage and in turn bump some other middle passenger
if the extra cost seemed worth it.)
Working Passage- A starship captain with a crew shortage
may hire an individual to fill the vacant position, paying
not money but passage in return. Working passage may not
continue for more than three jumps, or the individual is
considered to have been hired for standard salary. In order
to be hired for working passage, the individual must have
some expertise in the position for which he or she is hired
(jack-of-all -trades may be substituted if necessary) . Baggage
totalling 1,000 kilograms is allowed. Working passage is
without cost to the individual.
Low Passage- Transportation while in cold sleep (suspended
animation) is possible at relatively low cost to the
passenger. The passenger is placed in a low passage berth
before the ship takes off, and travels the entire journey in a
state of suspended animation. He does not age, and requires
very little life support. Unfortunately, the low passage
system involves some intrinsic dangers to the passenger,
and he runs some risk of not surviving the voyage. Throw
5+ for each passenger when he is revived after the ship has
landed. DMs: Attending medic of expertise of 2 or better,
+1 ; low passenger with an endurance of 6 or less, - 1.
Failure to achieve the throw to revive results in death for
the passenger. Refunds or civil liabil ity if a low passenger
fails to survive the trip are not allowed. A player character
who travels low passage and survives should keep records on
the discrepancy between his chronological age and physical
age; a character does not age physically while in low passage.
Low passage costs Cr1 ,000 and includes a baggage allow·
ance of 10 kilograms.
Stowaways- Stowing away on a starship is a fifth form
of passage, and the least advisable. Sneaking aboard a
starship in order to gain passage to the next world is illegal,
if only because it operates to the detriment of the starship
owner's economic standing. It is also often a violation of
Game Designers' Workshop
various customs regulations. A basic throw of 4+ per day
applies for discovery of a stowaway. Various elaborate
schemes may allow DMs to this throw, based on the
referee's judgement. Upon discovery, the stowaway must
roll for the starship captain's reaction. Reactions of 6- will
result in spacing; the stowaway is forced out the air lock
without a vacc suit. Otherwise, reactions are determined by
the referee.
LESSER KNOWN ASPECTS OF SPACE TRAVEL
As interstellar travel has developed, the field has developed
its own dangers and customs. The following are just
a few.
The Low Lottery: It is customary for the captain to
contribute Cr10 out of each low passage towards a lottery.
Each low passenger guesses the number of low passengers
who will survive the trip. If the winner does not himself
survive, the captain receives the money. The ship's steward
administers the lottery.
Since low passengers are typically without funds (who
would travel low if there were any other choice?). the low
lottery provides some chance for the individual to have
funds upon arrival at the destination.
The Travellers' Aid Society: Individuals who have
decided that they wish to pursue a life of travel and adven·
ture may elect to join the Travellers' Aid Society, in order
to take advantage of its facilities and passage dividends.
Members of the Travellers' Aid Society receive, as a dividend
of membership, one high passage every two months.
The high passage may be used, retained for later use, or sold
for 90% of its cash value.
Membership in the Travellers' Aid Society may be
acquired as a mustering out benefit using the benefits table
in the navy and marine careers. Membership may also be
purchased at a cost of Cr1,000,000. Upon application for
membership, the individual is evaluated by a membership
committee (throw 4+ to avoid a blackball ). Only one application
per person is allowed. Membership is for the life of
the character, and is not transferable.
Hijacking: Starships can be easy prey for hijackers.

The Traveller Book
Starship crews maintain a constant guard against hijackers,
and the ship's computer can run an anti-hijacking program
which denies access to control areas to potential hijackers.
Passengers are required to check all weapons (except blades
and daggers) into the ship's locker; they are returned at the
end of the voyage. Nevertheless, there is a chance of an
attempted hijacking, for ransom or to steal the multimillion
credit vessel. Roll three dice for 18+ to indicate a
hijacking attempt (this throw does not apply if all passengers
are player characters). When an attempt occurs, randomly
determine the number of hijackers, their identities,
characteristics, and weapons, and implement their attempt
at some point during the voyage. They will gain complete
control of the ship only after defeating all other individuals
on the ship. If the anti-hijacking program is functioning, the
hijackers will be able to enter the bridge (gaining access
to the controls) only on a throw of 5-.
The results of hijacking range from release of passengers
without harm through marooning on uninhabited worlds
to spacing and death.
Skipping: Most starships are purchased on credit, and
the monthly payments required against the multi-million
credit debt are staggering. The owner or captain may decide
to steal the ship himself instead of remaining under that
load. Passengers have no way themselves of determining if a
specific ship is in such a status. Throw 12+ to determine
that a commercial ship is of this type. Ships which have
skipped are subject to repossession attempts if detected by
the authorities. Such attempts may range from the formal
service of papers through legal injunctions to armed boarding
parties. On each world landing, throw 12+ to avoid a
repossession attempt; apply a OM of +1 per 5 parsecs
distance from the ship's home planet, to a maximum of +9.
If the ship has called on the same world twice within the
last two months, apply a OM of -2.
Piracy: A starship may be attacked by pirates while
entering or leaving a system. Similar encounters may
involve customs agents or military vessels, including blockades.
The ship encounter table later in this book indicates
the procedure.
Gas Giants: Most star systems include in their family of
planets one or more gas giants - large worlds with hydrogen
or methane atmospheres. These gas giants are a valuable
source of fuel for starships.
In order to refuel from a gas giant, a ship must move
into orbit around it, and then dive deep into its atmosphere
with open fuel scoops. The procedure (called skimming)
takes approximately eight hours, and results in fuel tanks
filled with unrefined fuel.
Ocean Refuelling: Ships can refuel from the water
oceans of any world with a non-zero hydrographic percentage.
The process calls for the ship to land in or near an
ocean and then fill its tanks from the local water supply. It
takes approximately four hours and results in fuel tanks
filled with unrefined fuel.
STARSHIP MALFUNCTIONS
A starship can malfunction. The two major malfunctions
are drive failure and misjump. The primary influencing
factors are unrefined fuel and lack of maintenance.
Travel
Refined fuel is available at starports at about Cr500 per
ton; unrefined fuel is available at starports for Cr100 per
ton, or can be skimmed from gas giants for free. In addition,
water can be taken from oceans or lakes (if there are
any on the world) and used as unrefined fuel. Military and
quasi-military starships often use unrefined fuel because it
is more available, and because their drives are specially
built to use it. Commercial ships sometimes use unrefined
fuel because it is cheaper.
Starships require continuing maintenance as they operate,
and an annual maintenance overhaul to keep them
in top running order. Ships which are undercrewed and do
not carry enough dedicated or full -time skilled engineers,
and those which avoid or delay their annual maintenance,
run the risk of malfunction.
Drive Failure: Each week, throw 13+ for drive failure;
apply the following OMs: +1 if using unrefined fuel (and
not equipped to do so), +1 per engineer missing from the
crew list, +1 per week past annual maintenance overhaul
date. If a malfunction occurs, then throw 7+ for each drive
in use (jump, maneuver, power plant) to determine which
actually fail (if any). Failed drives cease operation completely;
maneuver drives will no longer thrust, jump drives
will fail and indicate that they cannot support jump, and
power plants stop delivering power. Batteries will provide
life support and basic lighting for 10 days. Throw 10+ per
day spent attempting repairs to fix them temporarily, with
OM +engineering skill of attending engineers. More complete
repairs must be made at a starport by qualified personnel.
Misjump: Each time the ship engages in a jump, throw
13+ for a misjump. Apply the following OMs: +1 if using
unrefined fuel (and not equipped to do so), +5 if within
100 planetary diameters -of a world, +15 if within 10
planetary diameters of a world. If the result is 16+, then the
ship is destroyed.
A misjump is an unpredictable random jump. Throw one
die to determine the number of dice thrown (1 to 6); throw
that number of dice to determine the distance of the misjump
in hexes. Then throw one die to determine the
direction of the misjump (one of the six directions possible
on the hex grid). Finally, throw one die to determine the
number of weeks spent in jump space before the ship
re-emerges at its new location.
Upon emerging from misjump, the challenge of determining
position and of travelling to an inhabited world
becomes paramount.

Starship Economics
The operation of starships in interstellar commerce requires an understanding of the economics which governs trade
between the stars. Prices and returns on effort and investment are controlled by the supply and demand which exists in the
commercial system. Because starships are so expensive, many of the prices in this section are expressed in megacredits
(abbreviated MCr) ; a megacredit is one million credits.
STARSHIP PURCHASE
Bank financing is available to qualified individuals for
the purchase of commercial starships. After a down payment
of 20% of the cash price of the starship is made, the
shipyard will begin construction of a specific vessel. Upon
completion, the vessel is delivered to the buyer, with the
bank paying off the purchase price to the shipyard. Because
the bank now holds title to the ship, the price must be paid
off in a series of monthly payments to it. Standard terms
involve the payment of 1/ 240th of the cash price each
month for 480 months. In effect, interest and bank financing
cost a simple 120% of the final cost of the ship, and
the total financed price equals 220% of the cash purchase
price, paid off over a period of 40 years.
In addition, the bank will insist that the purchaser
submit an economic plan detailing the projected activity
which will guarantee that monthly payments are made.
Unless a character has some form of guaranteed income
(perhaps large rents from some property he owns), this
condition will generally rule out purchases (at least fi·
nanced purchases) of yachts, military vessels, or exploratory
vessels.
Subsidies: The government may subsidize larger com·
mercial vessels (built on type 600 hulls or larger), primarily
to assure consistent service to specific worlds. These subsi·
dized merchants are generally assigned a specific route
connecting from 2 to 12 worlds of varying characteristics.
The route will generally be determined before a subsidized
merchant is purchased, to allow tailored design features as
may be necessary. When a subsidized merchant is ordered,
the character himself must make the 20% down payment,
with the government assuming responsibility for the payments
upon delivery, and taking 50% of the gross receipts
of the ship while in service. The character is responsible for
all expenses and costs of operation.
Subsidized merchants are also subject to mobilization
(and use as auxiliaries) in the event of emergency or hostil·
ities. At the end of 40 years, the vessel is completely paid
off, and full title passes to the character, but the vessel
remains subject to mobilization in case of government need.
STARSHIP EXPENSES
There are five basic expenses (in addition to the bank
payment, if necessary) associated with starship operation:
1. Fuel. Starship fuel costs Cr500 per ton (refined) or
Cr100 per ton (unrefined), at most starports. Fuel consumption
is based on formulae related to the size of the
starship power plant and the jump drive.
2. Life Support. Each occupied stateroom on a starship
involves an overhead cost of Cr2000 per trip (two weeks)
made. Each occupied low passage berth involves an overhead
cost of Cr100 per usage. There is a normal limit of one
person per stateroom, travelling couples or groups usually
taking adjoining staterooms. Military vessels or chartered
ships may be used with a double occupancy system (two
persons per stateroom). but this requires twice the normal
cost.
3. Routine Maintenance. Annually, a starship should be
given a complete overhaul in order to insure that it is kept
in good working order. Such maintenance costs 0.1%
(1/1000th) of the cash price of the ship, and requires two
weeks at a class A or B starport. The owner must make
provision for payment of the maintenance fee when it
comes due. Crew members generally take their vacations at
this t ime, but must still be paid. The ship owners must
make provision for the expected loss of revenue while the
ship is out of service.
4. Crew Salaries. Crew members must be paid monthly.
Non-player characters must be paid using the standard crew
salary schedule (with suitable modifications for expertise or
seniority, generally +10% for each level of expertise above
level 1 ). Player characters may bargain for better pay rates,
or they may elect to accept worse. In addition, player
characters may participate with the owner-captain and
accept shares in the proceeds of the ship's activities.

The Traveller Book
Characters who take working passage are not paid,
receiving passage, room, and board in lieu of salary (but
continuous working passage for more than three trips
results in automatic hiring and receipt of salary). The
starship captain is usually the pilot or navigator, and serves
as owner-aboard, drawing his pay from the profits. Not all
crew positions are required on all ships, and some ships will
have more than one person performing the same function.
For example, a large liner may have more than one steward.
5. Berthing CosU. Landing fees, handling costs, facilities
use charges, and other starport fees are a common practice,
and such costs must be paid as they occur. The average cost
is Cr100 to land and remain for up to six days; thereafter, a
Cr100 per day fee is imposed for each additional day spent
in port. In some locations this fee will be higher, while at
others local government subsidies will lower or eliminate it .
REVENUE
Ships generate revenue from cargo, passengers, and mail.
Cargo: Starships may inquire at a starport about the
number, sizes, and destinations of cargos awaiting transportation.
The referee should determine all worlds accessible
to the starship (depending on jump number), and roll
for each such world on the cargo table. Then he should roll
to determine the number of major, minor, and incidental
cargos available on the world of origin; modifiers take into
account the world of destination. After rolling for the
number of cargos, roll one die for each cargo to determine
its size. Multiply the die roll for major cargos by 10, minor
cargos by 5, and incidental cargos by 1 to determine the
number of tons in each. For example, if a ship is on a
population 6 world, going to a population 3 world with a
tech level 3 less than the current world, the referee rolls one
die for major cargos; he rolls a 4 (+2 from the table, - 4 for
the low population of the destination, +3 for the tech level
difference), giving five major cargos. He then rolls one die
for each cargo and multiplies each result by 10 to determine
their individual tonnages. Each cargo is a distinct shipment
and cannot be subdivided, but the ship may accept or reject
specific cargos based on the best fit within the cargo hold.
All cargos are carried at Cr1,000 per ton. Starship owners
may purchase goods locally and ship them at their own
expense, speculating that they can later sell at a profit.
Passengers: After a starship has accepted cargo for a
specific destination, passengers will present themselves for
transport to that destination. The passenger table is used to
determine the number of passengers desiring passage to the
announced world based on the origin world's population
and on the destination world's population and travel zone
status. Roll the dice specified (30-1 0, for example, indicates
that three dice are rolled, and the result of another
one die roll is then subtracted). Apply any indicated OMs.
Passengers will pay the standard fare for the class of
transportation they choose: Cr1 0,000 for high passage,
Cr8,000 for middle passage, and Cr1,000 for low passage.
Passage is always sold on the basis of transport to the
announced destination, rather than on jump distance.
Differences in starship jump drive capacity have no
specific effect on passage prices. A jump-3 starship charges
the same passage price as a jump-1 starship. The difference
Starship Economics
is that a jump-3 ship can reach a destination in one jump,
while the jump-1 ship would take three separate jumps
(through two intermediate destinations, and requiri ng three
separate t ickets) to reach it. Higher jump numbers also
may make otherwise inaccessible destinations within reach.
But for two ships of differing jump numbers going to the
same destination in one jump, each would charge the same
cargo or passage price.
Mail and Incidentals: Subsidized merchants may receive
mail delivery contracts, usually as an adjunct to their
established routes. Five tons of ship cargo capacity must be
committed to postal duty on a full time basis, the ship must
be armed, and a gunner must be a part of the crew. The
starship is paid Cr25,000 (Cr5,000 per ton of postal cargo
area) for each trip made, regardless of the actual mail ton·
nage carried. Such tonnage will not exceed 5 tons per t rip.
Other ships may be approached to deliver private mess·
ages, at times through the ship's owner or captain, and
at times clandestinely through a crew member. Private
mail is usually intended for delivery to a specific point
(such as the Travellers' Aid Society building, or a tavern
keeper), and is generally accompanied by a Cr20 to Cr120
honorarium. Throw 9+ for a private message to be awaiting
transm ittal, and determine randomly which crew member is
approached to carry it. Serving as a carrier for private mail
also serves as an introduction to the recipient as a dependable,
t rustworthy person.
TRADE CUSTOMS
The following are standard procedures in interstellar
commerce.
Delivery: Goods taken on in orbit are delivered when
placed in orbit around the destination. Goods loaded on a
planetary surface are delivered when off-loaded on the
surface of the destination. This custom applies to cargo,
passengers, and mail.
Shuttle Service: At any location with a class A, B, or C
starport, shuttles routinely operate between orbit and
world surface. Typical shuttle fares are Cr10 per ton of
cargo and Cr20 to Cr120 per passenger.
Charters: Non-starships charter for Cr1 per ton per hour,
usually with a 12-hour minimum. Charter price for a
starship is computed based on its revenue generating
capacity. Starships are chartered in 2-week blocks; the
charge is Cr900 per ton of cargo hold plus Cr9,000 per high
passage berth and Cr900 per low passage berth. The owner
pays all overhead and supplies a crew.

The three travel formulae assume constant acceleration to midpoint, turnaround,
and constant deceleration to arrive at the destination at rest, as shown in the
diagram above. There are three variables; if any two are known, the third can be
determined using one of the formulae at right. The variables are time (T) in seconds,
distance (D) in meters, and acceleration (A) in meters/second2. Other units must be
converted to these three before using the formulae. For example, suppose a player,
using the units in the miniatures rules described later in this book, wishes to deter·
mine how long it would take (in 1QOO.second turns) to travel 3 scale meters (or
300,000 kilometers - each millimeter equals 100 kilometers) at 1 G. To get meters
from kilometers he must multiply by 1,000 (300,000 km=300,000,000 meters); to
get meters/second2 from Gs he must multiply by 10 (1G=10 meters/second2). The
formula is then: T(in seconds)=2xy(300,000,000/10), or 10,954. To translate into
1QOO.second turns, he divides by 1,000 to get about 11 turns.

Ship Design and Construction
Space ships are constructed and sold at shipyards throughout the galaxy. Any class A starport has a shipyard which can
build any kind of ship, including starships with jump drives; any class B starport can build small craft and ships which do
not have jump drives. Starports are explained under Worlds. The military procures vessels through these shipyards, corpora·
tions buy their commercial vessels from them, and private individuals can purchase ships that they have designed through
them as well. The major restriction on the purchase of ships is money.
Definitions: The words vessel, ship, starship, non-starship, and small craft are used with special significance when referring
to space travel. A vessel is any interplanetary or interstellar vehicle. A ship is any vessel of 100 tons or more. A
starship is a ship which has jump drives and can travel on interstellar voyages. A non·starship is a ship without jump drives.
A small craft is any vessel under 100 tons; all small craft are incapable of jump.
SHIP DESIGN
Most vessels are constructed from standard design plans
which use time-tested designs and combinations of features.
Shipyards work from these plans which cover every detail
of construction and assembly.
Naval Architecture: Small design corporations can
produce design plans for any vessel type once given the
details of what is desired. The design procedure is fol·
lowed to determine what is available and allowed, and the
results are presented to the naval architect firm. They
produce a detailed set of design plans in about four weeks
for a price of 1% of the final ship cost; they can be hurried
to finish the job in two weeks if paid 1.5%. Once the design
plans are received, the shipyard may be commissioned to
produce the vessel desired.
Standard Designs: There are a number of standard design
plans available; they have been in use for a long time, and
are available for a nominal fee (Cr100 for the set). Standard
starship plans available are: 100-ton scout/courier, 200.ton
free trader, 200-ton yacht, 400-ton subsidized merchant,
600-ton subsidized liner, 800-ton mercenary cruiser, and
400.ton patrol cruiser. Standard plans are also available
for the following small craft: 20-ton launch, 30-ton ship's
boat, 30-ton slow boat, 40-ton pinnace, 40-ton slow pin·
nace, 50-ton modular cutter, 95-ton shuttle, and 10-ton
fighter. Other standard plans may be available at various
localities.
Standard designs are easier to produce; their prices
reflect a 10% reduction in normal pricing. The details of the
standard designs are shown at the end of this chapter.
Standard design vessels are often available used ( 10 to 40
years old) at reductions in price ranging from 10% to 40%,
as indicated by the referee.
Construction Times: Time required for building any
vessel depends primarily on the hull. The drive potential
table indicates construction time for each tonnage of hull;
any hull over the indicated tonnage requires the next higher
construction time. The standard hulls table gives shorter
construction times for those hulls; they are more familiar to
the shipyard and easier to build.
Costs and Payments: A shipyard will insist upon a 20%
down payment with the order for the vessel, as well as
a demonstration that proper financing is available to cover
the balance when due.
REQUIRED STARSHIP COMPONENTS
Starships are constructed on the foundation of a hull,
into which are fitted the drives and power plants, the fuel
tankage, life support equipment, computers, controls,
armaments, and other fittings that adapt it to its intended
function. The total tonnage of the installed fittings cannot
exceed the tonnage of the hull.
The Hull: Hulls are identified by their mass displace·
ments, expressed in tons. As a rough guide, one ton equals
14 cubic meters (the volume of one ton of liquid hydrogen).
When hulls are constructed, they are divided into
an engineering section for the drives and the main compartment
for everything else. All drives and power plants
must be located in the engineering section, and only drives
and power plants may be placed in that section. All other
ship components, including fuel, cargo hold, living space,
and computer, must be located in the main compartment.
The standard hulls table shows six standard hulls which
are available at reduced prices and construction times. Any
other hull must be produced on a custom basis at a cost of
MCr0.1 per ton; minimum price MCr20. Construction (or

The Traveller Book
build) times for custom hulls are shown in the last column
of the drive potential table.
Hulls vary in their requirements for drives and power
plants based on tonnage. Any specific drive will be less
efficient as the tonnage it must drive increases. The drive
potential table lists 24 standard drive types, identified by
the letters A through Z (omitting I and 0 to avoid con·
fusion with the numerals 1 and 0). Also listed are various
tonnage levels for hulls; any tonnage which exceeds a listed
level should be read at the next higher level. Correlating
hull size with drive letter indicates drive potential. For
maneuver drives, this potential is the Gs of acceleration
available. For jump drives, the potential is the jump number
(Jn), or jump range in parsecs. For power plants, it is power
plant rating (Pn). For example, a 200-ton hull equipped
with maneuver drive-A can produce 1-G acceleration; an
800-ton hull equipped with jump drive-D can produce
jump-2.
The Engineering Section: Drives are installed in the
engineering section. A non-starship must have a maneuver
drive and a power plant. A starship must have a a jump
drive and a power plant. A maneuver drive may also be
installed, a power plant must be installed. In all cases, the
power plant must equal or exceed the higher of the maneuver
drive and the jump drive letter. The drives used are
described in price and mass in the drives and power plants
table; their tonnage may not exceed the tonnage of the
engineering section of the vessel.
It is important to note from the drive potential table
that some drives will not produce results in some tonnages
of hulls, as indicated by a dash instead of a number on the
table; the drives and power plants table also indicates that
some drives will not fit into some hulls. During the design
process, it may also turn out that after fitting a set of drives
and power plant into a hull, there may be insufficient
tonnage remaining for fuel, basic controls or life support.
Drive ratings greater than six are not available from the
equipment shown here.
The Main Comparttnent: The ship's main compartment
contains all non-drive features of the ship, including the
bridge, computer, staterooms, low passage berths, cargo
hold, fuel tanks, armament, and other items.
A. The Bridge: All ships must allocate 2% of their
tonnage (minimum 20 tons) to basic controls, communications
equipment, avionics, scanners, detectors, sensors,
and other equipment for proper operation of the ship. The
cost for this bridge is MCr0.5 per 100 tons of ship.
The basic controls do not include the ship's computer,
which is installed adjacent to the bridge. The computer is
identified by its model number; the computer table indicates
price, tonnage, capacity, and tech level available. In
general, larger computers are better in combat situations. In
addition, the model number indicates the highest level of
jump possible for a ship. For example, a ship must have a
Model/4 computer before it can perform jump-4, in addi tion
to the jump drive rating installed.
CPU refers to the computer's central processing unit,
indicating the capacity to process programs; storage refers
to the additional capacity available to hold programs in
readiness for processing. Programs themselves are classified
Ship Design and Construction
by size, using a point indicator to specify how much of the
CPU or storage capacity is required for that program to fit
into the computer. The number (and exact types) of
which are on hand, in storage, or in the CPU is important in
the operation of the starship, especially in combat.
Computer software (programs) must normally be acquired
separately by purchase (or they may be written by a
character who has computer expertise). Each computer
model as originally furn ished includes a basic software
package of commonly used programs. This package is
selected by the purchaser from the list of available programs;
the computer model (1 through 7) indicates the
credit value which may be selected. For example, Model/1
allows a package with a value of MCr1, wh ile Model/6
allows a value of MCr6.
There are two bis (meaning second, or improved) models
of computer available. Each is treated as the next higher
level for jump support, but as the next lower level for
software selection. Thus, the Model/1 bis can support
jump-2, but has a software package value of only MCr1.
Fire control equipment is required if weaponry is to be
installed. Each installed turret requires one ton of displacement
committed for fire control equipment.
Original design plans for ships often include reserve
tonnage for later use in installing fire control equipment, or
for upgrading computers.
B. Staterooms: Quarters for the crew and passengers are
provided in the form of staterooms containing sleeping and
living facilities. Each stateroom is sufficient for one person,
displaces 4 tons, and costs Cr500,000. In some starships
(especially exploratory vessels, military ships, and privately·
owned starships), double occupancy is allowed in staterooms.
No stateroom can contain more than two persons
however, as it would strain the ship's life support equipment.
A commercial ship must have one stateroom for each
member of the crew.
C. Low Passage Berths: Facilities for carrying passengers
installed in a ship. One low passage berth carries one low
passenger, costs Cr50,000, and displaces one-half ton. Low

Ship Design and Construction
berths also serve well in emergencies, in that they can
provide suspended animation facilities for characters when
medical care or rescue is not immediately available.
Emergency low berths are also available; they will not
carry passengers, but can be used for survival. Each costs
Crt 00,000 and displaces one ton. Each holds four persons
who share the same revival die roll.
D. Fuel: Total fuel tankage for a ship must be indicated
in the design plans. There is no cost, but the capacity does
influence how often the ship must refuel. At a minimum,
ship fuel tankage must equal 0 .1 MJn+tOPn, where M is the
tonnage of the ship, Jn is the ship's jump number, and Pn is
the ship's power plant rating. Power plant fuel under the
formula (10Pn) allows routine operations and maneuver
for four weeks. Jump fuel under the formula (0.1 MJn)
allows one jump of the stated level. Ships performing jumps
less than their maximum capacity consume fuel at a lower
level based on the jump number used.
E. Cargo Hold: The design plan must indicate cargo
capacity. There is no cost, but cargo carried may not
exceed cargo capacity.
F. Armaments: Any ship may have one hardpoint per
100 tons of ship. Designation of a hardpoint requires no
tonnage, and costs Cr100,000. Hardpoints may be left
unused if desired.
One turret may be attached to each hardpoint on the
ship. When it is attached, one ton for f ire control must be
allocated. Turrets themselves are available in single, double,
and triple mounts which will hold one, two, or three
weapons respectively. Prices for turrets and weapons are
indicated on the weapons and mounts table.
Turrets and weapons may be altered or retrofitted. For
example, a single turret can have its pulse laser replaced by
a beam laser when it becomes available; a single turret can
be replaced by a t riple turret when it becomes available.
Weapons for installation in turrets include pulse and beam
lasers, missile racks, and sandcasters. All are used in the
space combat system described later in this book.
OPTIONAL COMPONENTS
The following are optional components. Where not
present, they may be added to a standard design by the
purchaser.
Atmospheric Streamlining: The hulls specified are rough
deep space configurations incapable of entering atmo·
spheres. They may be streamlined by so indicating in the
design plans, at a cost of MCr1 per 100 tons of ship. This
streamlining includes fuel scoops which allow the skimming
of unrefined fuel from gas giants and the gathering of water
from open lakes or oceans. Streamlining may not be retro·
fitted; it must be included at the time of construction.
Game Designers' Workshop
Ship's Locker: Every ship has a ship's locker. The actual
cost of much of the equipment within the locker is incon·
sequential when compared to hull and drive costs; the
referee should administer what is actually within the ship's
locker based on the situation. Typical equipment carried
aboard will include protective clothing, vacc suits, weapons
such as shotguns or carbines, pistols, ammunition, com·
passes and survival aids, and portable shelters.
Ship's Vehicles: A ship may have one or more sub·
ordinate vehicles specified as part of the ship's equipment,
and tonnage may be devoted to the permanent stowage or
hangarage of the vehicles. The vehicles list indicates those
vehicles and small craft commonly available.
Air/rafts, ATVs, GCarriers, and speeders are described in
the chapter on equipment. In most cases, vehicles will have
ports or bay doors opening to the outside; air/rafts,
GCarriers, and speeders can reach orbit, and are often
launched to a world surface from orbit. If an ATV is
carried, provision must be made to move it to a world
surface if the ship is not streamlined (unless the vehicle is
intended for use only on worlds without atmospheres).
Small craft are covered later in this chapter. When
small craft are carried on a ship, it must have sufficient
tonnage to hold each small craft allocated as small craft
hangars or compartments.
SHIP CREWS
Each ship requires a crew. On small ships, the crew may
be one person; on larger ships, the crew can be quite large.
The following basic crew positions must be filled:
Pilot: Each starsh ip and non·starship requires a pilot,
who must have at least pilot-1 skill. Small craft require a
pilot who must have at least ship's boat-1.
Navigator: Each starship displacing greater than 200 tons
must have a navigator. The pilot of a small craft or non·
starship can handle its navigation requ irements.
Engineer: Any ship with tonnage 200 tons or more must
have one engineer (with minimum engineer-1 skill) per 35
tons of drives and power plant. If there is more than one
engineer, then the most skilled (or the oldest) becomes
chief engineer with 10% more pay. Ships under 200 tons
and small craft do not require an engineer, although en·
gineering skill may prove useful.
Steward: If high passengers are carried, then a steward is
required. There must be at least one steward (steward
skiii·O or better) per eight high passengers on the ship. If
there is more than one steward, the most skilled is designated
chief steward (or purser) and draws 10% more salary.
Medic: Each starship of 200 tons or more must have a
medic (medic-1 skill or better). In addition, there must be
at least one medic per 120 passengers carried. If there is
more than one medic, the most skilled is designated ship's
doctor and draws 10% more pay. Non-starships and small
craft do not require medics.
Gunner: One gunner (gunnery skill·t or better required)
may be hired per turret on a ship. Armed small craft require
a gunner in addition to the pilot. If there is more than one
gunner, the most skilled is designated the chief gunner and
draws 10% more pay. The gunner position may be omitted
if there is no major threat to the ship.

The Traveller Book
One person may fill two crew positions, providing he or
she has the skills needed for both jobs. However, because of
the added burden, each position is filled with skill minus
one, and the individual draws salary equal to 75% of each
position; thus, to fill two positions, the character must have
skill level 2 in each, except steward, which requires level 1.
No person may assume the duties of more than two crew
positions except in the case of an emergency.
Other crew positions may be created depending on the
facilities of the starship: for example, a starship which
carries a cutter could have a crew position for cutter pilot
(and possibly for cutter gunner) in addition to its normal
crew positions. Specific jobs or tasks (laboratory technician
if the ship has a laboratory; contact specialist if the ship
is assigned alien contact missions) require crew members
to perform them.
For starships of greater than 1000 tons hull mass displacement,
the crew should also include a commanding
officer (or captain). his executive officer, and at least
three administrative personnel. Extremely large starships
should have at least 10 crew members for each 1000 tons of
mass displacement.
WEAPONRY
The four commonly available weapons types are pulse
lasers, beam lasers, missile launchers, and sandcasters.
Pulse Lasers fire short bursts of energy at targets and are
more effective at inflicting damage than are beam lasers.
Beam Lasers fire continuous beams of energy and are
more effective in achieving hits than are pulse lasers.
Missile Racks are launchers for small anti-ship missiles.
The typical missile is a homing type which constantly seeks
the target ship, ultimately being destroyed by the target's
defenses, or exploding and doing damage to it. Such
missiles may also be converted to planetary surface bombs,
or to surveillance drones (mechanical and electronic skill
should apply in such cases). Individual missiles weigh about
50 kg, and cost Cr5,000 each.
Sandcasters are defensive weapons; they dispense small
particles which counteract the strength of lasers and protect
the ship. The specific particles used are similar to the
material used in ablat personal armor; replacement canisters
of this special sand weigh about 50 kg and cost Cr400.
SMALL CRAFT
Vessels under 100 tons are considered to be small craft.
There are eight standard designs available; each design plan
is available for Cr100. All take approximately twelve
months to build. All are streamlined, and can enter atmospheres.
All can operate with unrefined fuel; they have fuel
scoops which allow them to skim fuel from a gas giant.
Each small craft design is intended to be as useful as
possible. As a result, the description covers basic performance
of the craft, and indicates price, crew, and
other details. Each craft also has a feature called excess
space: this interior tonnage may be used by the purchaser
for a wide variety of purposes. In effect, when the craft is
procured, it is customized by the purchaser for some
specific use. Any fitting or combination of fittings shown
on the fitting table may be specified for a standard design
Ship Design and Construction
small craft. The prices, however, are ignored, and are considered
to be included in the standard design price. For
example, the launch, with 13 tons excess space, could
utilize that space for 5 tons of fuel, 10 passenger couches, a
small craft cabin, and one ton of cargo. As another example,
the vessel could have all 13 tons allocated to cargo. In
either case, the price of the launch remains MCr14.
Fittings: The fittings table indicates items which may be
allocated to small craft. Staterooms, low berths, and
emergency low berths are the same as those used in larger
ships. The small craft cabin is a small, one-passenger stateroom
for use on longer duration voyages. It can be used
double occupancy on small craft which have no bridge, but
the crew will become increasingly uncomfortable. Small
craft couches are individual passenger seats; one is required
for each passenger carried (if a stateroom or cabin is not
provided). Each small craft except the fighter already
has two small craft passenger couches installed (the fighter
has one). Cargo and fuel tankage are simply allocated; one
ton of cargo space carries one ton of cargo, while one ton
of fuel tankage carries one ton of fuel. The fuel tankage
listed for each small craft supports four weeks of operation.
Each additional increment of fuel tonnage added supports
an additional four weeks of operation.
Listed crew for all small craft except the fighter is two:
pilot and rider. The craft may be operated by one pilot if
desired. The pilot must have ship's boat skill (or may use
pilot skill minus one). The rider may be a gunner, a passenger,
or a co-pilot. If the craft is armed, but carries no
gunner, the pilot may fire the weapon with a OM of -1
on the weapon.
Computers may be added to small craft, but such
computers must be purchased normally. Specific computer
restrictions are indicated in the small craft descriptions.
Weaponry may be added to small craft. Each small craft
may allocate one ton to weaponry and install up to three
weapons. The individual listings indicate specific weapons
which are available for the small craft.

There are two ship's vehicles: an air/ raft and a 20-ton
launch. Cargo capacity is 6 tons. Two 7-ton capture tanks
hold specimens, and a 7-ton trophy lounge serves as a
hunter's recreation area. The hull is streamlined.
The safari ship requires a crew of five: pilot, navigator,
engineer, steward, and medic. A gunner and additional
expedition personnel may be added. The pilot operates
the launch; the steward operates the air/ raft. The ship can
carry a party of six (or up to 8 if the crew goes to double
occupancy) on expeditions; it does not engage in commercial
passenger service. The ship costs MCr81 .08 (including
10% discount for standard designs) and takes 11 months to
build.

BUILDING CUSTOM SHIPS
Should one of the standard design ships not meet an
individual's or a government's needs, a naval architect will
certainly be willing to earn his or her 1% fee by providing
design plans for any specific vessel . The process begins by
directing the potential purchaser to the starship design
checklist for details of the desired ship. The following notes
should also be made available to the prospective ship
designer and purchaser:
1. Custom hulls with mass displacements other than the
hull sizes shown on the drive potential table are treated as
the next larger size (for example, 101 tons is treated as
200 tons for the purpose of drive selection). The maximum
hull possible in these rules is 5000 tons.
2. Only the drives and power plants shown on the drive
potential table are possible. Drives marked with a dash (- )
may not be used with that hull size.
Sufficient fuel tankage to meet the power plant and
jump drive fuel requirements must be installed. More,
to support more jumps or longer endurance by the power
plant, may be allocated.
3. The definitions given in the introduction to this
chapter apply. In order to build a starship, the hull tonnage
must be at least 100 tons. In order to build a non·starship,
the hull tonnage must be at least 100 tons and the jump
drive is omitted; pricing remains otherwise the same.
This design and construction procedure does not apply
to small craft, but the standard small craft shown in this
chapter may be customized to a great extent.
4. Typically, hardpoints are designated (and fire control
space allocated) on a ship design plan, but turrets and
weapons are left off to reduce the total ship cost as well as
the architect's fee. Turrets and weapons may be added
later.
5. The naval architect will insist on receiving his 1% fee
upon delivery of the plans and specifications. These design
plans, once acquired, may be retained or filed by the
adventurers, and upon delivery to a shipyard can be used to
begin construction of the ship.
FORMATS
Once a custom ship has been constructed, it must be
described in such a way as to allow the characters and
players to utilize it and to understand its configuration.
There are two ways to describe a ship: with a paragraph of
description, and with a form.
TAS Form 3: The Travellers' Aid Society Form 3 shown
on the next two pages can be photocopied and used to note
all of the important aspects of the ship. The form is in·
tended to be supporting documentation on the ship as it
is used in Traveller adventures, and so includes provisions
for dates and background details as well as the basic ship
information.
In practice, the two methods should be combined. The
ship designer should write up a paragraph description on
the ship as an introduction. The actual ship user should fill
out and keep current the T AS Form 3 that covers the ship
while in operation.
Paragraph Description: Using the starship design check·
list, determine the exact design of the ship, including
Ship Design and Construction
tonnages, prices, and details. Then write a paragraph of
description for the ship, using the example below. The
standard starship designs are written using this system. The
end result should be sufficient to allow anyone reading it to
understand the ship enough to use it.
In the example, words between dashes (for example,
-ship descriptive name-) must be substituted by an
appropriate word or phrase. Blanks require an appropriate
number or letter. Additional sentences describing special
modifications and alterations may be added as needed.
-Ship Descriptive Name- (type_):

positions- may be added.
The -crew member- operates the -ship's vehicle-.
The ship can carry_passengers and_low passengers.
The ship costs MCr (-appropriate discounts
and included fees- ) and takes ___ months to build.
DECK PLANS
If the referee or the designer should feel that detailed
deck plans for a ship are required, then they may be drawn
up using square grid graph paper. The preferred scale for
ship interiors should be 1.5 meters per square, with the
space between decks (floor to ceiling height) put at about
3.0 meters. One ton of ship displacement equals approximately
14 cubic meters. With a 3.0 meter floor-to-<:eiling
height, one floor square (1.5 meters by 1.5 meters by 3.0
meters) equals 6. 75 cubic meters. Two such squares equal
13.5 cubic meters, or approximately one ton.
When allocating space within the ship for deck plans,
assume that only a portion of stateroom tonnage must
actually be in staterooms; the remainder should be used
for common areas and other accommodations for the crew.
Finally, a leeway of plus or minus 10% to 20% should be
allowed. If the final deck plans come within 20% of the
tonnage of the ship specifications, then they should be
considered acceptable.
Keep completed deck plans available for use in campaigns
and adventures.

Computers
The computer installed on a ship controls all activity within, and is especially used to enhance weapons fire and defensive
activity. It also transmits control impulses for maneuver and jump drives, and conducts the routine operation of all ship
systems. What the computer actually does is based on the programs installed and operating at any one time.
Computers are identified by model, and specified in terms of their capacity to process and store programs. Models
range from Model/1 to Model/7. Capacity is stated as the size of the CPU (central processing unit) and of available storage
for programs. All programs in the computer's CPU are processed simultaneously, while programs in storage are available on a
revolving basis to replace those in the CPU as needed. For example, a Model/1 computer has a CPU capacity of two, and an
additional storage capacity of four. The computer might have in it six programs (each of size or space 1): return fire,
predict-1, gunner interact, auto/evade, maneuver, and target. Of these six, only two (the capacity limit of the CPU) can
function at any one time (in one phase). In the laser return fire phase, both target and return fire programs would be required,
and only those programs could be used with this capacity CPU to effect laser return fire. During a laser fire phase, as
before, only two programs could be used: target is required, but the player could select between predict-1 or gunner interact
for the program to be processed, depending on which would provide the greater benefit.
During the computer reprogramming phase, specific programs may be removed from the computer and others inserted.
To continue the example above, both jump-1 and navigation would be required for the performance of an interstellar jump.
Both programs would be fed into the computer during the reprogramming phase, but only after sufficient space had been
cleared (perhaps by removing the maneuver and auto-evade programs).
THE SOFTWARE LIST
The computer software list indicates the various programs
that are available. It shows space required by a
specific program in CPU or storage, its price in MCr, and its
title. Also shown is a brief overview of its effects. The three
right-hand columns indicate various requirements for
individual characters producing the programs. Such a course
will save money, but may have some pitfalls.
Programs in the software list are classified as offensive,
defensive, and routine.
Offensive programs are intended to allow the use of
weapons mounted on a ship to damage or destroy enemy
vessels. They are useful only if the vessel mounts weaponry.
Target identifies enemy vessels and controls all turrets
on board ship. It is required for all laser fire and missile or
sand launches except anti-missile fire. It provides no OMs of
its own.
Predict is a series of five programs which predict the
future position of the target and allow insertion of lead into
laser fire. Predict applies only to laser fire, and allows an
advantageous OM to hit.
Gunner interact interfaces the expertise of the gunner in
a specific turret to the hit probability of those lasers hitting
the target. The expertise of the gunner becomes a positive
OM to hit when using laser fire.
Selective allows a gunner to select either the main
compartment or engineering section as the target to receive
hits to be inflicted. Each of the three selective programs
inserts OMs against the probability of hitting the more
restricted target, but hits, if made, are assured of going on
the selected portion of the target.
Launch allows missiles to be launched from launch racks
and sand to be fired from sandcasters. The target program is
also required.
Multi-target is a series of programs that interfaces the
ship's detectors and radar with several turrets and allows an
attack on more than one target at one time. Each turret
may still only fire at one specific target, but different
turrets may fire at different targets. This program is required
if more than one ship target is fired on in the same
phase. The target program is also required.
Double fire allows a ship to draw excess power (if
available) from the power plant and thus increase the
output of laser weaponry. When this program is functioning,
a vessel with a power plant rated at least one letter
higher than its maneuver drive (and which has not yet taken
damage to reduce the current letter rating to equal to or
below the M-Drive letter) can fire a double beam or double
pulse with laser weaponry. The normal dice throw to hit is
made twice. Each time double fire is used, a throw must be

The Traveller Book
made to determine if overload has occurred: For the first
phase of such fire, throw 1+ to survive overload; for the
second phase, throw 2+ to survive, and so on; OM -1 for
each turn in which lasers do not fire at all. If the throw to
survive is not achieved, a hit is received on the ship's power
plant.
Defensive programs are used to protect a starship against
enemy action.
Maneuver/evade is a series of six programs which auto·
matically produce minor movement for a ship, thus reduc·
ing its chances of being hit by laser fire. Each program has a
OM based on pilot expertise (multiply pilot skill by the
stated fraction and round down to a whole number). In
addition, these programs allow the use of the maneuver
drive as required, just like the normal maneuver program.
Auto/evade is similar to maneuver/evade, but performs
at a lower level; it allows a defensive OM against laser fire of
- 2.
ECM is an electronic countermeasures program which
jams and confuses the homing heads of incoming missiles,
forcing them to explode prematurely in many cases. During
the laser return fire phase, all missiles in contact with the
ship are destroyed without damage to the ship on a throw
of 7+.
Return fire allows laser weaponry to fire at enemy ships
which have fired at it in the immediately previous fire
phase. Use of this program also requires the target program,
and OMs produced by other programs (such as gunner
interact) are allowed. If more than one enemy ship is fired
on, the multi·target program is also required.
Anti-missile allows any or all laser weaponry to fire at
enemy missiles which have contacted the ship during the
preceding movement phase. The target and multi-target
programs are not required. Other programs do not affect
the functioning of these programs (with OMs, etc.).
Routine programs are used to operate ship's systems
other than weaponry, and without regard to violent inter·
action.
Maneuver is required to allow the use of maneuver drive.
In combat it is often replaced by the maneuver/evade
program.
Jump is required to allow the ship to perform a jump
through interstellar space. The specific program for the
jump distance required must be used. For example, a
jump-6 ship which is going to perform jump-3 must use
the jump·3 program.
Library is an encyclopedic compendium of information
concerning the local stellar region, especially the local
sector and subsector. Crew and passengers often refer to
this program before disembarking on a world. The referee
will often find this a handy method of imparting commonly
known information to the players. The note should be
made that the library program is not all-inclusive, and may
be incorrect in some facts.
Generate creates a flight plan which will govern the use
of the jump program. The navigator or pilot can input
specific co-ordinates into the computer concerning a
destination, and the generate program will create a flight
plan to take the ship there. In cases where a generate
program is not available, starports have single-use flight
Computers
plans (in self-erasing cassettes) available for all worlds
within jump range for Cr10,000 per jump number. The
generate program may be used independently and produces
the required flight plan, which is then used by the com·
puter when jump is performed.
Navigation controls the jump process after a flight plan
has been produced. Flight plans must be fed into the
navigation program, which then interfaces with the jump
program to actually take a ship to its destination. To
actually make a jump, both the jump and navigation
programs must be functioning in the computer (the gener·
ate program need only run long enough to actually create
the flight plan).
Anti-hijack protects the ship against potential takeovers
by hijackers. This program constantly monitors conditions
within the starship, and automatically locks the access
doors to the bridge and controls when a hijack situation
occurs. Because this system is not foolproof, would-be
hijackers may gain access in spite of the program on a
throw of 5 or less.
WRITING COMPUTER PROGRAMS
Player-characters can, and should, seek out new and
different computer programs to improve the performance
and enlarge the capabilities of their spacecraft. Generally,
writing a program requires computer skill, and also some
skill which relates to the actual task being programmed.
The computer software list indicates in two columns the
computer skill level required as a minimum to write the
program, any other skill required, and the throw per week
of work to succeed. Computer skill above the required level
is allowed as a OM on the throw to succeed. The other skill
required may be possessed by another person helping the
programmer.
Fatal Flaws: Any home written program may have a
fatal flaw concealed within. This bug may not appear until
the program is really needed. The referee should note the
potential for a fatal flaw and roll as required (suggested
roll: 11+ for the bug to appear).
SMALL CRAFT COMPUTERS
Small craft do not require computers, and ordinarily do
not have them. They utilize their weapons with negative
OMs of -1 and cannot add in gunner skill when they are
used. However, if a small craft adds a computer to its
weapon system, then the ordinary computer programming
rules apply to it (except that ship's boat skill is needed
instead of pilot skill when writing such programs) .
USING THE SOFTWARE LIST
The computer software list on page 75 shows the basic
information required for the use of software.
In space combat, the important information is space
required by the specific program, title, and effects.
In ship design and construction, the important informa·
tion is cost in MCr and space required.
To characters interested in writing their own programs,
the skills column shows the computer skill required, any
other skill also called for, and the throw per week of work
required to succeed in writing the program.

Space Combat
Encounters in space can be routine, or they can be extraordinary. In some circumstances, battles may result. Starship
battles may be resolved by spaceship combat with miniatures in accordance with the following rules. These rules serve well
in nearly all situations, from simple encounters where a free trader attempts to outrun a pirate or revenue cutter, to the
complex engagements between starship squadrons of rival systems or empires.
Basic Parameters: Starship combat must deal with the following scale for movement and combat resolution:
1. Time: Each game turn represents 1,000 seconds.
2. Space: A playing surface is required, representing space as a two-dimensional surface at the scale of 1: 100,000,000;
one millimeter equals 100 kilometers. Three meters equals one light-second. Planetary template disks may be produced to
show the presence of worlds and the effects of gravity.
3. Thrust: Maneuver drive thrust is measured in Gs (gravities) expressed as a vector (an arrow indicating both length
and direction. Direction is infinitely variable; the length of the arrow is represented at the scale 100 mm equals 1-G (1,000
seconds acceleration at 1-G will produce a velocity change of 10,000 km, or 100 mm in scale, per turn).
4. Units: Starships and space vehicles are individually represented by spacecraft miniatures, or (if necessary) by
counters or markers. Because spacecraft miniatures are vastly oversize for the scale in use, each should be marked with a
spot or point to designate the exact location of the ships in play.
TURN SEQUENCE
Starship miniatures battles are resolved in a series of
game turns, each representing 1000 seconds elapsed time.
Most battles, regardless of the number of ships or players
participating, will involve only two sides. These two sides
alternate player turns within a game turn. Thus, each 1000
second game turn includes two player turns, one for each
combatant side. Each player turn is further divided into
several phases which allow specific activity to be performed
in a regular, orderly manner.
Native vs. Intruder: For convenience, the two sides in
the battle are referred to as the intruder and the native.
This terminology is intended to avoid possible confusion
when one side is called the attacker but is in reality defen·
ding. Other terms could (and sometimes should) be used
instead.
The sequence of the complete turn is given in the game
turn sequence table. Activity must be performed only in
the appropriate phases of the game turn or player turn; for
example, spacecraft may not move during the laser fire
phase, ordnance may only be launched during the ordnance
launch phase, and computers may only be reprogrammed in
the computer reprogramming phase.
PREPARATION FOR PLAY
Each ship involved in space combat must have a data
card prepared for it. This card contains basic information
about· the ship, serving as a reference for the players during
the course of the battle. As damage occurs, it is marked on
the card to reduce the ship's abilities in later turns.
Because many starship battles are possible over the
course of a Traveller campaign, the common 3 x 5 index
card has been selected for recording the necessary ship
information. This card may be prepared using the data on
T AS Form 3 or from a ship paragraph description.
To prepare a data card, note the name and ship type on
the top line of a blank 3 x 5 index card. Below the name,
on succeeding lines along the left side of the card, write the
six basic sections of the ship, followed by their values:
1. M-Drive (followed by the drive letter).
2. Power Plant (followed by the power plant letter).
3. J-Drive (followed by the drive letter).
4. Fuel (followed by the fuel tonnage).
5. Hold (followed by the cargo hold tonnage and all
vehicles carried).
6. Bridge (followed by the pilot expertise).
Below this data, list all turrets (numbered consecutively
starting with T-1 ). After each turret designation, indicate
the armament with which each turret is equipped, using the
letters B (beam laser) , P (pulse laser), M (missile launcher),
and S (sandcaster). A triple turret would have up to three
letters indicating the weapons installed in it, while a single
turret would only have one. After the letters for the weap·
ons, indicate the skill of the gunner in the turret. Also
indicate the number of missiles present in each launch rack.
To the right of the card, indicate the computer model, as
well as the CPU and storage capacity. Below that, indicate
the computer programs which are carried on board the ship.
During the game, these programs will be entered into the
computer, and will be cycled from storage to CPU and
back, so leave room to mark them with a pencil to indicate
their status.
The data card example shows how a typical type S scout
would be represented, armed with typical weaponry. Data
cards must be created for all starships and non·starships.
When creating cards for non-starships which were designed
and built in accordance with the design rules, the above
format applies. The jump drive letter designation is simply
left blank. When a data card is made for small craft, the
standard format is used, and appropriate items are left
blank. Maneuver drives for small craft are labelled with
drive letter zero. Computers and programs are listed only if
they are actually installed. All weaponry is listed as being in
a single turret.

The Traveller Book
MOVEMENT
Ships move using their maneuver drives; use of the jump
drive exits a ship into interstellar space, out of the area of
play. Maneuver drive uses thrust to accelerate a ship in a
specific direction for a specified distance. This direction
and distance are expressed as an arrow (a line in one direction)
called a vector. Vectors determine how far, and in
what direction, a ship can travel.
Each ship has a vector, which expresses that ship's
velocity as a line (arrow) of a specific direction. For example,
a ship might have a vector of 150 mm at 90 degrees, or
of 100 mm at 277 degrees. It is possible to have a vector of
0 mm , whereupon the direction becomes irrelevant because
the ship is stationary. Vectors are marked on the playing
surface using string or soft wire. On some playing surfaces
chalk can be used; on others, paper, pen, pencil, or
colored markers will be useful.
A ship's vector determines the direction and distance a
ship will travel in the next turn, provided it is not changed
by voluntary acceleration or by gravitational effects. With a
vector of 150 mm at 90 degrees, a ship will travel 150 mm
at 90 degrees in its next movement phase. In clear space,
without gravitational influence, and without voluntary
acceleration by the ship, it could travel at 150 mm per turn
(direction 90 degrees) forever.
Acceleration involves altering a ship's vector by adding
another to it; this new vector can come from thrust using
the maneuver drive, or it can come from gravity. In either
case, the method is the same. Vectors are added by placing
them in a chain, head to tail, and then drawing a new vector
from the tail of the first vector to the head of the last vector.
The vector addition diagram illustrates the concept of
vector addition. As shown in figure A, to add two vectors
(vector 1 is 75 mm at 90 degrees, and vector 2 is 25 mm at
90 degrees), place the tail of vector 2 at the head of vector
1, and draw a line from the tail of the first vector to the
head of the second vector. The result is a vector of 100 mm
at 90 degrees.
Figure B is a more complex example of vector addition.
Two vectors are at angles to each other (vector 1 is 75 mm
at 90 degree~ and vector 2 is 75 mm at 180 degrees). To
add them, the tail of vector 2 is placed at the head of vector
1, and a new vector is drawn from the tail of vector 1 to the
head of vector 2. In this case, the new length is approximately
106 mm with a direction of 135 degrees.
The important point to note, however, is that mathematics
are not required for the solution of vector problems;
a new vector is generated by simply laying all required
vectors on the playing surface, and connecting them as
shown above.
In a player's movement phase, he or she will indicate the
acceleration (new vector) desired and note any gravitational
influence vector called for. They are all added to the ship's
present vector. The ship then moves in the direction of its
new vector, for the length of the vector. This vector then
remains on the playing surface for reference during the next
applicable movement phase.
Ships are restricted in the amount of acceleration which
they may add to their current vector in one movement
Space Combat
phase. Generally, a ship cannot accelerate more than 100
mm times its maneuver drive rating in Gs. Thus, a standard
design type A free trader is capable of 1-G acceleration,
and cannot add more than a 100 mm vector per turn. This
does not count acceleration due to gravitational influence,
and does not restrict repeated acceleration in succeeding
turns. While a free trader can only accelerate 100 mm per
turn, after 10 turns of continuous acceleration, it would
have accumulated a vector 1 meter long.
There is no restriction on the number of accelerations
which may be made by a fueled ship, but the total acceleration
in a turn (in millimeters) may not exceed 100 mm
times the rating of the maneuver drive. Should the letter
class of the maneuver drive (or the power plant) be reduced
by combat damage, it may not exceed the revised size
rating. Unused acceleration may not be saved or conserved
to allow excess acceleration in following turns.
GRAVITY
The section on planetary templates later in this chapter
covers the construction of specific world disks, complete
with gravitation bands which can affect movement. When
the vector of a ship passes through the gravity bands of a
world, the gravity may alter that vector. During the movement
phase, lay out the vector of the ship to determine
where it will move. If the exact midpoint of the vector lies
in a gravity band, a gravity vector will be added to the
course vector to create a new vector. The length of this
gravity vector is equal (in mill imeters) to the strength of
the gravity band in Gs x 100. Thus, a vector dictated by the
0.5 G band of a world is 50 mm long. The gravity vector is
parallel to a line connecting the regular course midpoint to
the planetary template center. It is added to the regular
course vector (along with any ordinary course change
vector) during a player's movement phase.
LASER FIRE
In the laser fire phase of a player turn, the phasing
player may fire laser weaponry at enemy targets. The
following procedure dictates the order of actions taken by
ships using laser fire. Several variables may affect this
action.

GAME TURN SEQUENCE
A Intruder Movement. The intruder moves his ships using the movement,
gravity, and other applicable rules. Ordnance (missiles and sand) which he has
launched in previous game turns is moved at the same time.
B. Intruder Laser Fire. The intruder may fire his ships' laser weaponry at
enemy targets, subject to the combat, computer, and other applicable rules.
Only laser weaponry may fire in this phase.
C. Native Laser Return Fire. The native may return fire with his laser
weaponry at enemy ships which have fired on him, provided his return fire
computer program is running during this phase, and in accordance with the
computer program and combat rules. Anti-missile fire may be performed in this
phase if the appropriate computer program is running.
D. Intruder Ordnance Launch. The intruder may launch ordnance (missiles
and/or sand) at enemy targets or on specific missions, subject to the applicable
rules. Ordnance which has contacted enemy ships explodes in this phase.

SPECIAL RULES
Missile Detonation: Missiles inflict
1 D ( 1 to 6) hits when they detonate.
From those hits, each hit location and
hit effect is determined separately.
Shifting Fire: Once a target is desig·
nated, a ship which shifts fire to
another target in the same turn is
subject to a OM of -6 to hit for the
remainder of the turn.

Space Combat
First, the firing player selects the target at which the
turrets of a single ship will fire. All lasers from one turret
must fire on the same target; lasers from different turrets
may fire on different targets if a multi-target program is
running and allows such activity. The firing player then
designates the targets for the rest of his ships.
Second, the firing player determines all applicable attack
OMs and sums them to create one specific DM which he
will use. Because of differences in ships, he may create one
DM for each ship involved. Most attack OMs are the result
of computer programs, but some may be forced by ship
damage.
Third, the target player determines all applicable defense
OMs and sums them to create a single defense DM to be
used against the enemy fire. Defense OMs resu lt from such
circumstances as obscuring sand, range, or defensive programs.
Fourth, two d ice are thrown, and that result modified
by both the attack and defense OMs. If the modified result
equals or exceeds 8, a hit is achieved. The dice throw is
made once for each firing laser weapon. The total number
of hits is noted.
Fifth, each hit received is located on the target ship.
Using another two dice throw for each hit, the hit location
table is consulted, and a specific effect is obtained and
marked on the ship data card.
Laser fire is possible only for the phasing player, and hits
are imposed on the target ship immediately. Return fire
occurs in the following phase, and may be conducted only
by ships which are capable of doing so after this phase.
Shifting Fire: Each firing ship must allocate its fire to a
specific target before any ship has actually fired. Such
allocation may be changed (shifted) if the target is destroyed
before any weapons on the attacking ship have
fired, but such a shift is subject to a DM of -6 in addition
to all other applicable OMs.
Game Designers' Workshop
LASER RETURN FIRE
Laser return fire is conducted by those ships which have
been targets for laser fire from enemy weaponry in the
preceding laser fire phase. Both the target and return fire
programs must be in the CPU for return fire to be performed.
Laser return fire may only be directed at an enemy
ship which fired at this ship. Laser return fire may be made
against multiple enemy ships only if the mult i-target
program is also present.
Anti-missile fire also takes place in the laser return fire
phase. It is dependent on the anti-missile fire program. For
anti-missile fire to be performed, no target program is
necessary.
ORDNANCE LAUNCH
During the ordnance launch phase, missiles or sand (or
both) may be launched, provided both launch and target
programs are running. In addition, lifeboats or ship's
vehicles may be launched (without programs being necessary)
as desired.
During the ordance launch phase, missiles or sand which
contacted a target in the preceding movement phase now
explode or take effect.
Ordnance must be specified as launched during the
launch phase, and only one missile or sand canister may be
launched from a launch rack or sandcaster. The launched
item does not actually move until the following friendly
movement phase. All ordnance which is launched has the
launching ship's vector, which must be taken into account.
Reloading: Each launcher (sand or missile) has an
inherent capacity for three missiles or canisters. This means
that a triple turret with three missile launchers has a total
of 9 missiles in ready position.
When a launcher's missiles or canisters are exhausted, it
may be reloaded by the turret's gunner in one turn. Reloading
three launchers would take three turns. A gunner
engaged in reloading is unable to fire other weaponry in the
turret.
Missile Detonation: Ordnance which impacts a target in
a movement phase, and which then survives anti-missile fire,
detonates in the ordnance launch phase. This detonation
will inflict 1 to 6 hits depending on the range at detonation.
For each missile, throw one die. The result is the number of
hits inflicted; each resulting hit location is determined
separately.
DETECTION
Ordinary or commercial starships can detect other ships
out to a range of about one-half light-second, about 1,500
millimeters. Military and scout starships have detection
ranges out to two light-seconds, 6,000 mm or 6 meters.
Ships which are maintaining complete s ilence cannot be
detected at distances of greater than half detection range;
ships in orbit around a world and also maintaining complete
silence cannot be detected at distances greater than
one-eighth detection range. Planetary masses and stars will
completely conceal a ship from detection.
Tracking: Once a vessel has been detected, it can be
tracked by anyone up to three light-seconds (about 9,000
mm, or 9 meters).

The Traveller Book
DAMAGE DEFINITIONS
Once combat results in hits against a vessel, the damage
must be implemented. The precise portion of a ship affec·
ted by hits is determined from the hit location table.
Separate columns are provided for starships, non-starships,
and small craft. The following instructions detail the
manner in which damage affects ships.
Drives and Power Plants: Each hit achieved on a drive or
power plant reduces its letter classification by one. Thus C
becomes 8, X becomes W, etc. The potential of the drive or
power plant is then computed based on its temporary new
letter. Note that the letter rating of a power plant must
equal or exceed that of a maneuver or jump drive in order
for the drive to function.
A drive or power plant which is reduced to a level of the
maximum drive potential table where its capabilities are
marked with a dash cannot function; a drive or power plant
reduced to less than A is destroyed, and must be replaced
rather than repaired.
Turrets: Each turret hit incapacitates a turret, preventing
it and its weaponry from functioning. In cases where
multiple hits occur on a ship with more than one turret,
roll dice to determine randomly which turret or turrets are
hit. A turret may be hit more than once, while another may
not be hit at all.
Hull: A hull hit decompresses the ship's hull. Further
hull hits have no effect.
Hold: A hold hit allows potential damage to items in the
hold, including ship's vehicles and small craft, as well as
cargo. Each hit destroys ten tons of cargo, or one vehicle,
or one small craft. Roll dice to determine randomly which
items are damaged.
Fuel: Each fuel hit punctures a fuel tank, and releases
about 10 tons of fuel. When sufficient fuel hits have been
inflicted to reduce the remaining fuel to less than is re·
quired for a jump, the vessel may not make a jump; when
all fuel is accounted for, the vessel may not use its
maneuver drive or fire its lasers.
Computer: Each hit on the computer increases its
chance of malfunctioning. The basic throw for a computer
to operate in any situation is 1+, indicating extreme reliability.
Each hit on the computer serves as a OM of -1 on the
throw to operate. Thus, after three hits are infl icted on the
computer, a OM of -3 is applied to the throw of 1+ to
operate. The throw to operate is made each time the
computer is "used (in combat, this is generally once per
phase). A computer which does not make its throw to
operate malfunctions for the remainder of the phase. A new
throw is made at the beginning of the next phase. A computer
which has received 12 hits is permanently malfunctioning.
Persons with computer expertise may apply
their skill levels as OMs on the throw to operate. A computer
which is not operating effectively paralyzes a starship.
A computer hit on a small craft which does not have one
is treated as a hit on the craft's drives instead.
Small Craft Cabin: A hit on a small craft cabin results in
explosive decompression if depressurization has not already
occurred. Additional hits have no effect. Persons in vacc
suits within the craft are unaffected.
Small Craft Weaponry: A hit on the weaponry of a small
Space Combat
craft destroys that weaponry. Additional hits have no
effect.
Small Craft Drive: A hit on the drive of a small craft
destroys the drive; the craft cannot maneuver, accelerate, or
fire its lasers.
Hits as a result of laser fire, laser return fire, or missile
detonation are located on the target vessel through the use
of the hit location table. Such damage as indicated above is
then marked on the ship's data card.
If a select program is being used to influence attacks, the
firing player rolls one die for each hit inflicted. On a roll of
1 or 2, he or she picks the hit location, specifying one of
the following : maneuver, power plant, jump, fuel, hull,
hold, computer, or turret. If the roll is 3 or greater, roll hit
location normally.
Damage to ships gradually wears away their capabilities,
but will not generally destroy them in one shot. The
exception to this is the critical hit. If a critical hit is
achieved, then the critical hit table is consulted with one
die. The result is complete destruction or incapacitation of
the indicated item. Unlike ordinary hits, the entire item is
destroyed (crew is not necessarily killed, but is rendered
unable to function).
SPECIAL SITUATIONS
The following are descriptions of several special situat
ions and how they may be handled when they arise. In
addition to the specific instructions given, they also serve as
a model for dealing with other special situations.
Decompression: Vessels depressurize their interiors
before combat whenever possible, the passengers and crew
resorting to vacc suits for safety and comfort. This procedure
minimizes the danger due to explosive decompression
as a battle result. In some cases, selected areas may
remain pressurized (perhaps the hold, for the safety of
delicate cargo) while other areas are depressurized.
77

78
Space Combat
Any number of areas in the ship may be depressurized in
the span of one turn (1,000 seconds). Repressurization
requires one turn. In practice, the following parts of the
ship may be individually pressure regulated : engineering
section, hold, bridge, staterooms (all as one group; on some
ships, in groups of four or more), turrets (individually). The
pilot controls depressurization from the bridge.
Hull hits result in explosive decompression if pressure
has not already been lowered. Explosive decompression
kills all persons in that section unless a vacc suit is available
and put on immediately. Throw dexterity or greater to put
on a vacc suit in an emergency; apply OMs of double vacc
suit skill.
Atmospheric Braking: Ships passing very close to the
surface of a world with a standard or dense atmosphere
may slow their speed through atmospheric braking. If
any portion of a ship's vector passes within 10 mm of a
world's surface, that vector is reduced by 10 mm in length.
Abandon Ship: Should circumstances warrant, a ship
may be abandoned using ship's vehicles or other methods.
Military vessels (including exploratory vessels) can generally
board the full passenger and crew complement of their
ship's vehicles in one turn, and launch them during the
ordnance phase, provided those individuals perform no
other activity during the turn. If individuals are encumbered
by vacc suits, each boards in the first turn on a throw
of 6+, boarding in the next turn if unsuccessful.
Non·military vessels require 10 turns to fully load all
ship's vehicles. Crew members in the vehicles may elect to
abandon ship without waiting for stragglers.
Individuals in vacc suits may abandon ship during the
ordnance launch phase providing no other activity is
performed during the player turn. Such persons may
then be picked up by other ships or vessels. If no one is
available to perform a rescue, then an attempt at landing on
a local world is possible. A vacc suit can support its occupant
for up to 21 one-thousand second turns; an additional
air tank set will provide another 21 one-thousand second
turns. A typical vacc suit is capable of a total of 100 mm of
acceleration. A foamed atmospheric re-entry ablation
shield (part of the vacc suit kit) can protect the individual
while entering atmosphere, provided his vector, while
entering atmosphere, does not exceed 75 mm. Accident or
mishap can occur during the process. Throw 7+ to survive
provided all else is performed properly; allow a OM of +
vacc suit skill.
Damage Control: Damage inflicted on starships in
combat can be repaired or controlled by crew members
during the battle. Especially in the case of player characters,
expertise or skill in specific fields may be used to remove or
repair damage. Usually, a throw of 9+ will repair one hit of
damage, with skill serving as a positive OM. One repair
attempt may be made per one-thousand second turn. Any
part of a ship which has been completely destroyed cannot
be repaired.
Repair Parts: Most malfunctioning or damaged items in a
vessel can be temporarily repaired from the stock of emergency
materials in the ship's stores. Malfunctions usually
occur in terms of a specific assembly (ship's computer,
jump drive, etc.), and the cost of the repair is based on the
Game Designers' Workshop
cost of the original assembly. After determining the cost of
the assembly (from the component cost section of these
rules), roll two dice: this indicates the cost of replacement
of the item in 10% increments; allow a OM -2 if the repair
installation will be made by ship's crew rather than a
shipyard. Because the repair cost can run to 120% in some
cases, complete replacement of the item is sometimes
cheaper. In the case of minor malfunctions, OMs may be
applied to the repair cost throw as considered appropriate.
Repair parts cost of 0% is considered to be inconsequential.
STARSHIP ENCOUNTERS
When a starship enters a system, there is a chance that it
will encounter any one of a number of different ships going
about their business. Very often, the exact encounter is the
responsibility of the referee; for routine encounters, or for
inspiration, the starship encounter table is provided.
The table classifies each system by the starport within it.
Two dice are rolled and modified by the presence of scout
or naval bases in the system. If a dash is shown on the table,
then there is no encounter. The letter codes indicate the
various types of standard design ships described earlier in
this book. The referee should examine the specific type of
ship involved and determine the precise nature of the
encounter. Free traders may want to swap rumors and
gossip; scouts may want information; patrol cruisers may
want to inspect for smugglers.
The suffix P on any ship type can be construed as pirate;
such a ship will probably attack, or at least try to achieve a
position where it can make the attempt.
It is also possible to encounter a variety of small craft in
a system. If an asterisk appears on the table entry, a small
craft has also been encountered. Roll one die and consult
the standard small craft table. This encounter may occur
before or after the large ship encounter.
The referee may want to use the reaction table from the
chapter on encounters to determine the precise reaction of
any type of ship and crew.
PLANETARY TEMPLATES
A planetary template must be constructed for each
world or moon present in the scenario, showing the size of
the planet itself and of its zones of various gravitational
strengths. All required information may be generated
using the formulae below. 0 is the planetary size from the
UPP; R is its radius in millimeters (hundreds of kilometers);
M is its mass in Earth masses; G is gravity in Gs at various
distances from its center (and Gs is its surface gravity); K is
its density in Earth densities (most planets will have a
density of 1); L is the distance from the planetary center
at which gravity equals the value of G for a planet of mass
M (when G is set equal to G5, L should equal A). The
planetary template is constructed in the following steps.
Step 1. Using the known values of 0 and K, compute the
values of A, M, and G5 •
Step 2. Compute several values of L, for several values of
G, beginning at 0.25 and increasing in increments of 0.25
until the value of G equals or exceeds Gs (that is, until L is
equal to or less than R).

The Traveller Book
Step 3. Using a compass and ruler, draw concentric
circles on a paper or cardboard template. Indicate the
planetary surface by drawing a circle of radius R. Then
draw further circles around the same center with radius
equal to each value of L determined in step 2. Each circle
should be labeled, and the interior of the planetary disc
should be marked with the planet's name, its mass, density,
G5 , and any other data the referee thinks useful.
As an example of this process, here is how to determine
a template for Earth:
Step 1. Earth has a diameter (D) of 8 and a density (K)
of 1.0; thus, R=8x8 or 64mm, M=1.0x(8/8)3 or 1 Earth
mass (surprise!). and G5=1.0x8/8 or 1G.
Step 2. Since G5=1, it is necessary to determine L for
G-values of 0.25, 0.50, and 0. 75. At G=0.25, L=64x the
square root of 1/0.25 or 128mm; at G=0.50, L=64x the
square root of 1/0.50 or 91mm; at G=0.75, L=64x the
square root of 1/0.75 or 74mm.
Step 3. The template is now drawn using the derived
values. Four concentric circles are drawn: one of radius
64mm for the planet's surface, and one each of radii 74, 91,
and 128mm for G-values of 0.75, 0.50, and 0.25 respectively.
Some Notes of Interest: In the scale presented for
miniatures combat, there should generally be at most one
world or moon of appreciable size on the average size
playing surface. The Earth's moon is 380,000 km from
Earth, a scale separation of 3.8 meters. However, a ship
travelling at reasonable game speeds can cross this distance
in only a few turns; thus, it will be necessary to shift
positions of templates frequently as a battle progresses.
A template for the sun, if anyone cared to do one,
would be almost 74 meters in radius (out to the G=0.25
ci rcle); the physical surface of the sun would have a radius
of 7 meters.
Asteroids, planetoids, and small moons such as those of
Mars have no significant gravity or atmospheres, and would
be essentially pinpoint-sized at this scale. The average
density of an asteroid belt is about one asteroid per 1000
square millimeters (approximate separation: 30 millimeters)
or 1000 asteroids per square meter. Asteroids should
probably be placed on a template for ease of shifting.

0. 75 Gs. Noted next to the world on the template are the
universal planetary profile (see Worlds) and the world
name. If you are going to construct templates for specific
worlds, then the inclusion of continental outlines or other
surface features may prove interesting.
Formulae: The four formulae shown under the sample

mation needed for producing any planetary template.
Typical Worlds: The standard worlds table shows the

Worlds
The referee has the responsibility for mapping the universe before actual game play begins. The entire universe is not
necessary immediately, however, as only a small portion can be used at any one time. In unsupervised play, one of the
players can generate worlds and perform mapping on a turn by turn or adventure by adventure basis.
The universe is mapped in convenient segments, called subsectors. Each subsector is an area of hexagonal cells measuring
eight hexes by ten hexes. Since the recommended scale is one parsec (3.26 light years) per hex, the subsector covers an area
ten parsecs by eight parsecs. The subsector grid on page 13 is intended to be photocopied by the referee and filled in as
worlds are generated. Additional copies can be made as mapping continues to other subsectors.
Sixteen subsectors (arranged in four rows of four subsectors each) form a sector, probably the largest size practical
for a continuing Traveller campaign.
Mapping subsectors consists of two sequences: star mapping and world mapping. Star mapping examines each hexagon in
the subsector grid and determines if there is a star system present. It also determines the presence or absence of starports,
bases, and fuel for starships. All of this information is coded onto the subsector hexes, and serves as a guide to the referee
and to the players during interstellar travel. World mapping examines the single most important world in each system and
determines the basic characteristics for it. This information is retained for use in adventures on the world surface.
STAR MAPPING
In order to create a subsector, the referee uses a blank
subsector grid and dice to determine the presence of
systems, starports, and bases. The system hex format table
shows the coding and placement of information about
worlds within a subsector. This format should be used to
allow players and referees to note the information that
would normally be available to them. The referee may elect
to omit some information, and only allow it to be inserted
after the players have determined it themselves.
World Occurrence: There is a basic one·half chance
normally that a world (and its attendant stellar system) will
be in a hex. Systematically check each hex, throwing one
die and marking the hex with a circle if the result is a 4 , 5,
or 6. This indicates that a world is present; otherwise, leave
the hex blank.
The referee may elect to alter the normal chances of
worlds, making them more frequent or less frequent to
correspond to specific regions of the galaxy. This is easily
accomplished by imposing a DM of +1 or ·1 on the whole
subsector, or on broad areas within a subsector.
Starport Type: Many worlds have starports, their pre·
sence being essential to interstellar trade and commerce.
Each world must be checked for its starport type; throw
two dice for each world in the subsector, and mark the
world with the letter indicated on the system contents
table.
The system contents table indicates one specific distribu·
tion of starports as a basis for star mapping. Just as the
distribution of stars can be altered (as indicated in world
occurrence), the referee is also free to create other starport
distributions.
Starports are further described in the starport types
table. In many cases, starports will be accompanied by
naval or scout bases, and will have a wide range of facilities.
In nearly all cases, a planet will consider that a starport is
extraterritorial, and not subject to local law, but will also
enforce strict entrance and exit controls.
Bases: Stellar systems may have bases for military forces,
the navy, the scouts, or for other arms of interstellar
government. The system contents table indicates the die
throws for specific types of bases to be present at a world,
depending on the starport type. If a base is present, it
should be marked in the hex in accordance with the world
format.
Gas Giants: A star system may have one or more gas
giant planets (similar to Jupiter or Saturn). The presence of
a gas giant allows streamlined starships to refuel by skim·
ming; this eliminates fuel cost for the vessel and increases
profit. It also allows refueling at systems that do not have
starports. Refueling in this fashion generally requires a
week. Fuel acquired by skimming is unrefined.

The Traveller Book
Gas giants are relatively common. As indicated on the
system contents table, throw 10+ for a gas giant not to be
present in the system. If one is present. mark the system's
hex in accordance with the world format.
System Name: Each system is generally named for the
primary world within. This name should be decided upon
by the referee and placed in the hex for identification.
Travel Zones: Most worlds are assumed to be civilized,
or at least amenable to travellers and visitors. Some, however,
are caught in the throes of war, plagued by disease, or
simply not ready for interstellar visitors. Such worlds are
classified by travel zones to denote such status. In most
cases, the referee should indicate travel zones based on the
information available. Two such zone types exist: amber
and red.
Amber travel zones indicate that travellers should
exercise caution when visiting such worlds. The amber code
may mean that the citizens of the world are xenophobic,
that the political situation is chaotic, or that some other
danger exists within the system.
Red travel zones usually indicate that a major danger
exists within the system. This danger may be disease and
the world is quarantined. The system may be involved in a
war, and surface or space battles may be probable. Red
travel zones are also used to show a government edict
prohibiting entry to the system or world. This may be to
protect a local civilization which is still developing and not
yet ready for interstellar contacts, or to protect valuable
resources until the government can mine them.
Communications Routes: Within the subsector, local
governments will have established communications or trade
routes connecting some (but not all) worlds. These routes
serve as a conduit for messages between businesses and
between governments as well as between people. They also
serve as the basic routes that liners and large freighters
travel. The referee should examine the subsector map and
connect key worlds with communications routes. If the
subsector is an isolated community, the routes may not
leave the map; if it is part of a larger confederation or
empire. the routes will probably leave the edges to join with
other parts of the sector.
Communications routes should be carefully drawn so as
to avoid making all parts of the subsector accessible; a
subsector should reserve some areas as backwaters for exploration
and adventure. Communications routes are drawn
as single lines connecting hexes on the subsector grid.
The star map, once generated, shows the distribution of
star systems in space, and shows their relationships to each
other in terms of relative distance and commercial spacelane
connections.
WORLD CREATION
The term world refers to the various bodies that are
contained in a stellar system; it encompasses planets,
satellites, and asteroid belts. For example, the single most
important world in a system may not be a planet; it could
be a satellite of a gas giant, or it could be a planetoid within
an asteroid belt.
The worlds contained in the star systems on the sub-
Worlds
sector map may be further classified in terms of their gross
physical characteristics and their effects on persons living
on them or travelling to them. These characteristics (star·
port, six basics, plus a technological index) indicate specific
facts about a world through the use of single digits (the
numbers 0 through 9) and letters (A through z. omitting 0
and I as they may be confused with numbers). In most
cases, the instructions below concentrate on numbers.
reserving letters for use by the referee to describe extraordinary
situations.
This world creation process applies only to the single
most important world in a star system; additional planets in
a system should be generated by the referee as necessary_
The six basic planetary characteristics are generated
using two-dice throws, with OMs applied based on other
characteristics. After these six are established, a technological
index is created from the information they
contain and from the world's starport type. Starport type,
the six basic characteristics, and tech level establish the
basic identity of a world. Additional information can be
generated, and should be, to more fully describe a world.
When originally generating a world, a subsector index
containing world name, locat ion, universal planetary
profile, and other basic data should be compiled. This
listing should be available to players who travel through the
subsector.
In addition, each world should be allocated at least one
(and preferably several) pages in a central notebook maintained
by the referee. As characteristics are generated, they
should be recorded along with the name of the world and
its location (generally its subsector and hex number). In
addition, the referee should generate other information
which may be pertinent; this may include details of other
planets in the star system, radiation characteristics of the
star. the types of terrain present on the planetary surface,
unique encounter tables (as prescribed by the section on
animal encounters), data on flora and fauna, industrial or
agricultural capacity. data on social structure and government,
or possibly actual maps of the planetary surface.

Worlds
The individual characteristics for worlds are produced by
six two-dice throws, modified by circumstances and by
previous characteristics. The specific throws are given in the
world generation checkl ist, and in formula form below.
Starports (from starport table): The starport type has
already been generated when the subsector was mapped,
and the information should be noted from the map.
Planetary Size (20- 2): The digit representing planetary
size indicates the diameter of the planetary sphere stated in
thousands of miles. This size determines varying gravitational
strengths and planetary templates for space combat.
Planetary Atmosphere (2D- 7+size; if size 0 then atmosphere
0): The atmosphere digit represents the breathing
environment encountered on the world. Some atmospheres
require protective measures.
Hydrographic Percentage (20- 7+atmosphere; if size 0
then hydrographics 0 ; if atmosphere 0, 1, or A+, then apply
DM - 4) : Hydrographics represents the percentage of
planetary surface (in increments of 10%) covered by seas or
oceans. For normal worlds, this will be water; on other
worlds (with exotic, corrosive, or insidious atmospheres), it
may instead be other liqu ids or fluids such as ammonia.
Population (20- 2) : The digit indicating population is an
exponent of 10. This may be viewed as the number of zeros
foll owing a one. Thus, a population digit of 6 indicates a
population of approximately 1,000,000.
Planetary Government (20- 7+population) : The digit
representing planetary government indicates a range of
possible ruling systems, from anarchy to totalitarianism.
The planetary government table gives a brief precis of the
general characteristics of each government type. Balkanization
is a special result, and indicates that there is no world
government; instead several rival territorial governments
exist. In such cases, the referee should generate the specific
qualities of each territory on the planet separately.
Law Level (20- 7+ government): The digit representing
law level indicates the relative force of law extant on the
world. Law level states local restrictions concerning the
possession and use of weapons by individuals.
At times, the referee (or the players) will find combinations
of features which may seem contradictory or unreasonable.
Common sense should rule in such cases;
players or the referee should generate a rationale which explains
the situation.
Finally, the referee should always feel free to create
worlds which have been deliberately (rather than randomly)
generated. Often such planets will be devised specifically to
reward or torment players.
TECHNOLOGICAL LEVEL
The degree of technological expertise, and thus the
capabilities of local industry, depends greatly on the basic
characteristics of a world. This technological index is
generated based on a one die throw, modified by OMs
dependent on planetary characteristics.
Consult the tech level table and compare the appropriate
planetary digits with the descriptions; note all OMs indicated,
and sum them to form one total DM. Throw one die,
and modify the result, thus determining the local techno·
logical level. Note the result in the appropriate records.
Game Designers' Workshop
World technological levels may vary from 0 to 20, more
commonly ranging from 4 to 10. Higher numbers indicate
greater capability. The technological level is used in conjunction
with the technological level table to determine the
general quality and capability of local industry. The tables
indicate the general types or categories of goods in general
use on the world. In most cases, such goods are the best
which may be produced locally, although better goods may
be imported by local organizations or businesses when a
specific need is felt. Local citizenry will usually not be
armed with weapons of a type which cannot be produced
locally, although police or military may be. Tech level also
indicates the general ability of local technology to repair or
maintain items which have failed or malfunctioned.
The technological level tables have several spaces or
holes, and such gaps should be filled in by the referee or the
players when they discover items or devices of interest.
REFEREE'S NOTES
The purpose of the world generation sequence is to prod
the imagination. Even the most imaginative individual
soon loses brilliance in the face of creating hundreds of
individual worlds. The procedure substitutes die rolls for
random imagination and then allows the referee to use that
information to determine specific world data. Imagination
may be required to explain a tech level 4 civilization in an
asteroid belt, or a high population world with a participating
democracy for a government.
Characteristics for worlds should be construed as guidelines
rather than strict limits. For example, a world with a
hydrographic percentage of A is 100% ocean; nevertheless,
the world would have small islands for a starport.
Starport: The various starport types are intended to
provide a variety of facilities for use in t rade or survey
missions. Starports provide fuel or construction yards.
Bases: The tables provide for scout and naval bases at
some worlds. These bases serve as points for scout and naval
veterans to renew acquaintances with old friends, to find
potential patrons, and to scrounge or buy surplus equipment
of use to them. The referee may elect to include other
types of bases, perhaps army bases, merchant exploration
or trade bases, and defense establishments.
Travel Zones: The use of travel zones is intended to
assist in designating areas to avoid and areas to explore. The
referee should establish reasons for travel zones.
World Size: The generation tables assume that the world
in question will be a solid matter sphere. Some alternatives
are possible, although they are rare enough to require
implementation by the referee. These include:
RoSffttes: Three or more equal masses (worlds) set at the
points of an equilateral polygon, and with the correct equal
angular velocities about their center of mass, will have a
stable orbital configuration; no central star is required.
Rosettes almost never occur naturally.
Ringworlds: An incredibly strong band may be set
rotating about a central star, making a ringwortd which uses
centrifugal force to provide a simulation of gravity. A ringworld
at the distance of Earth's orbit and with a width of
1.6 million kilometers has a usable surface area of about
three million Earths.

The Traveller Book
Sphereworlds: Using materials similar to those in a
ringworld, and adding gravity generators where necessary
for strength and comfort, a spherical shell could be used
to completely enclose a star. Such a shell would then trap
all stellar radiation for use by the civilization. With a radius
of about 93 million miles, the internal surface area would
equal about one billion Earths.
Atmosphere: The various atmosphere types require
specific personal equipment for survival and protection.
Vacuum or trace atmospheres require use of a vacc suit.
Tainted atmospheres require the use of filter masks.
Very thin atmospheres require the use of compressors to
insure sufficient oxygen. Tainted very thin atmospheres
require a combination respirator/filter mask for survival.
Thin, standard, and dense atmospheres are breathable
without assistance.
Exotic atmospheres require the use of oxygen tanks, but
proteCtive suits are not needed.
Corrosive atmospheres require the use of protective suits
or vacc suits.
Insidious atmospheres are similar to corrosive atmo·
spheres, but will defeat any personal protective measures in
2 to 12 hours.
Hydrographics: It is possible that some worlds with
vacuum atmospheres may have hydrographic percentages
greater than 0. In such cases, the world has ice-(;aps present;
the water will not be free-standing liquid.
Population Density: For comparison, the following
population densities are common on twentieth century
Earth. Earth on the whole has a population of about
three billion (population level 9); this is approximately 5
persons per square mile, or 16 persons per square mile of
land area. Europe is populated at about 151 persons per
square mile, the equivalent of population level 10. The
Netherlands contain 1500 persons per square mile, or about
population level 11 . Hong Kong has 10,000 persons per
square mile, the equivalent of population level 12.
Government: Government types are intended to convey
the general type of authority on the world; each listed type
should be a clue to the referee in administering details of
encounters on the world.
Law Level: Law level is an indication of the relative
oppressiveness of the world. The digit is classified on the
law level table to show prohibitions against weapons. It is
also the throw (law level +) to avoid being harassed or
arrested by local authorities.
Tech Level: The technological level of a world deter·
mines the quality and sophistication of the products of a
world. It indicates what precise types of equipment are
available and common locally.
TRADE CLASSIFICATIONS
Additional details of a specific world can be expressed
by the trade classification and statements about the world.
The referee should be ready to establish new classifications
when appropriate.
The term trade classification is a general catch-all phrase
that covers world attributes which influence trade and
commerce, and other information that is of interest to
travellers. Some trade classifications influence the trade and
Worlds
commerce table.
Agricultural worlds have large portions of their econ·
omies devoted to agriculture. They must have an atmo·
sphere of 4 through 9, hydrographic percentage of 4
through 8, and a population of 5 through 7.
Non-agricultural worlds import much of their food
from off-planet. While such a world may produce synthetic
foodstuffs for local consumption, it probably imports
quality foods as luxury items. A nonagricultural world must
have an atmosphere of 3 or less, a hydrographic percentage
of 3 or less, and a population of 6 or more.
Industrial worlds have large production bases and engage
in the manufacture of finished goods. Such a world must
have an atmosphere of 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, or 9 (vacuum, trace, or
tainted), and a population of 9 or greater.
Non-industrial worlds are forced to import much of their
finished goods. Non-industrial worlds must have a popula·
tion of 6 or less.
Rich worlds have good climates and environments and
are sought after by most individuals as living places. A rich
world must have government type 4 through 9, an atmo·
sphere of 6 or 8, and a population of 6 through 8.
Poor worlds are undeveloped and marginal backwaters.
A poor world must have an atmosphere of 2 through 5 and
a hydrographic percentage of 3 or less.
Water worlds are totally covered by seas and oceans
(a hydrographic percentage of A).
Desert worlds have no standing water (a hydrographic
percentage of 0) and atmosphere of 2+.
Vacuum worlds have no atmosphere (an atmosphere of 0).
Asteroid belts consist of small planetoids around the
central star of the system. An asteroid belt has a size of 0.
Ice-capped worlds have water present only in the form
of ice caps; these are vacuum worlds which would otherwise
have no water. An ice-capped world has an atmosphere of
0 or 1 and a hydrographic percentage of 1 or greater.
Subsector capital is the term given to the single most
important world in the subsector, especially if the entire
sector is under one interstellar government. [[Capital]] is the
term given to a world which is the seat of an interstellar
government. If there are several interstellar governments
within a subsector, each will probably have a capital.
[[Capital]] designations are assigned by the referee.
Other notations are possible as well. The referee may
elect to note the presence of prison worlds, exile worlds,
preserves or reserves for various purposes, and so on.

Animal Encounters
Animals in any ecological system interact with each other, forming food chains, obeying instincts, defending territory,
and generally living out their lives. When people enter such an ecological system, they will encounter the animals of the
system, prompting natural reactions, such as attack or flight.
Although the precise nature of animals may change, and they may prove quite alien to ordinary experience, most will
conform to the broad classifications given below. A referee may choose to establish his own ecological system on a specific
world, ignoring the encounter system outlined here. This system, however, is intended to allow broad latitude in both
animal types and attack/defense mechanisms, while remaining essentially logical and reasonable.
Animal Types: Nearly all animals may be classified into four basic categories: herbivore, omnivore, carnivore, and scav·
enger. Specific definitions for these terms are provided in a later section of these rules, and differ from the precise scientific
definitions in current use. Within each category, a variety of animal types exist, based on specific feeding/hunting habits;
examples of this concept are grazers, chasers, and pouncers. Animal encounters may be further classified into various
categories and types, and specific attack and defense mechanisms determined. The resulting description indicates the actions
an animal will take without resorting to such confining labels as bear or tiger. While a referee may well elect to use such
names, this system also allows the players freedom to encounter truly alien beasts as well.
Animal Encounter Tables: The referee must create a series of unique encounter tables, one set for each world in the
universe (only a few of these are necessary before play begins). Each set consists of one encounter column for each relevant
terrain type of the world. Generally, a referee will conceal the exact details of these encounter columns, so that persons will
only have clues as to the relative abundance or scarcity of specific animals in any specific area. Once these tables are created,
they are used each day to determine if animals are encountered, the specific nature of such animals, and how they react to
the adventurers. Hunting for sport or food is possible, and danger posed by animals may be great.
CREATING ENCOUNTER TABLES
Initially, the referee must prepare a blank encounter
column for each terrain type on the world. The terrain OMs
chart indicates the general types of terrain which might be
expected on the worlds to be visited. The referee should
determine if the encounter table will use one die or two;
two dice tables are more complex, and should be selected
for terrain or worlds that will be frequently used, while one
die tables are for worlds or terrain types which the referee
does not feel merit detailed representation. The examples
of blank encounter tables shown indicate the predetermined
sequences of animal categories which should be used
in most cases; these sequences may be varied by the referee
to f it specific situations or world conditions.
Once the encounter table format has been decided upon,
the referee notes the terrain type for the table, and consults
the terrain types table. Any applicable OMs are recorded.
The referee refers to the animal types table and rolls two
dice for the animal category involved. The result is the
animal type for the entry. The animal attributes table is
consulted to determine if the animal has any special attributes,
such as flying or swimming. The animal sizes and
weaponry table is consulted to determine the animal's size,
wound potential, weaponry, and armor. Finally, the characteristics
table is consulted to note the animal's predisposition
to attack or flee, and its speed.
When the encounter table calls for events, the referee
should insert an event from those described in these rules,
or generate additional events appropriate to the situation.
Animal Types: The animal types table indicates the
types of animals which occur within the animal categories
on the encounter column.
Special Attributes: Animals which adventurers will
encounter will tend to be walkers, but may be flyers,
swimmers, amphibians, or even triphibians. Throw two
dice and consult the special attributes table. OMs are
imposed for various world sizes and atmospheres. Insure
that the correct terrain column is used on the table. Four
special attribute types are possible on the table:
Flyers: Animals capable of flying through the use of
wings, levitating gas sacs, or other mechanisms.
Swimmers: Animals living in liquid and swimming
through the use of fins, flippers, jets, or other mechanisms.
Amphibians: Animals living in liquid, but capable of
emerging onto land.
Triphibians: Animals living in liquid, but capable of
walking on land and flying in the air.
Certain entries on the table are followed by a parenthetical
OM which must be applied to the animal size
throw; its general effect is to make flyers smaller and
swimmers larger. Note the special attribute (if any) on the
blank encounter column being filled in. Record any size
OM temporarily for use in the size throw to come.
Animal Size: Animals range in size from small (massing
about 1 kilogram) to giant (massing 6 tons or greater), and
exhibit a variety of characteristics related to size. Throw
two dice and consult the weight, hits, and wounds columns
of the animal size and weaponry table (rolling only once for
all three). OMs are imposed on this throw based on planetary
size, the terrain OM chart (by specific terrain type) and
as required by special attributes, if present.
Animal size is expressed on the table in kilograms, and
may be taken as a general indication of size in relation to
human beings (humans are assumed to be approximately

The Traveller Book
100 kilograms). All sizes may be construed to cover a range
of plus or minus 20%.
Animal Hits: The hits column indicates the number of
hits an animal can take, expressed as a dice throw. When an
animal has received wounds equalling or exceeding the first
dice throw, the animal is considered to be unconscious.
When it has received wounds equalling or exceeding its total
hits. it is dead. If an animal receives wounds equal to twice
its hits, it is destroyed and has lost any food or pelt value.
For example, an animal listed on the animal size and
weaponry table as taking 20/20 hits would have two dice
rolled twice: the first result would be the number of hits
required to render the animal unconscious. The second
two-dice throw would indicate the additional hits required
to kill the animal. If more than twice this combined value
is achieved, the animal is completely destroyed.
Animal Wounds: The wounds column indicates the
general effect of size on an animal's ability to cause damage
when it hits. The formula is noted and applied to the
effects of the animal's weapons when they are determined.
If, for example, the animal has teeth as its weapons, then
the weapons range matrix (in personal combat) states that
teeth inflict 10 hits when they hit. A wound alteration of
-20 indicates that the referee should roll 20 and subtract
that from 10 to determine the actual number of hits
inflicted. If the wound alteration is +40, then the teeth will
inflict 10 + 40 hits. If the wound alteration is x4, then the
teeth will inflict 1 Ox4 hits. The result is that of two ani·
mals armed with the same weapon, the larger will inflict
a heavier wound. For simplicity, the damage dice should be
rolled once when the animal is generated; the animal would
inflict that number of hits every time it hits. A roll of 0 or
less equals 1; an animal always has the ability to do some
damage. If the referee wishes to take the trouble, he can
roll the proper number of dice every time the animal hits;
in this case, a roll of 0 or less would equal 0.
Animal Weaponry: Animals are naturally equipped with
weapons which enable them to attack and defend. Familiar
terms such as teeth and claws indicate the effects in the
combat system, but should also be considered to approxi·
mate other equivalent systems if necessary. Entries such as
teeth+1 indicate a OM to the combat roll of the weapon,
making it more effective. In some cases, unusual wea·
ponry is indicated by the statement as [weapon type]. for
example as pike. The combat effect may be read from the
weapons matrix (and wounding from the range matrix) in
the chapter on personal combat. Weapon types should
always be considered to be descriptive of result rather than
of strict process.
Throw two dice and consult the animal weapons
column. Implement OMs as indicated on the table.
Animal Armor: Some animals possess armor protecting
them from attacks by other animals. Armor is intended to
indicate the general effectiveness of the armor, not its
specific construction. Entries such as battle+4 indicate OMs
to the combat die roll, making the armor less effective.
Throw two dice and consult the animal armor column.
Implement the OMs as indicated on the table.
Animal Characteristics: Because animals have predispo·
sitions to attack or to flee, these details must be noted
Animal Encounters
on the animal encounter table for each specific type pre·
sented. These characteristics are noted in the form of three
codes in the table: A, F, and S. Each is followed by a
number which indicates the throw involved.
A indicates attack predisposition. A7 would indicate
that the animal will attack on a throw of 7+. The number 0
indicates a special case, and the animal will attack if it
meets certain criteria for its type.
F indicates predisposition to flee. F7 would indicate that
the animal will flee on a throw of 7+. The number 0 is a
special case, and the animal will flee if certain criteria for
the animal type are met.
S indicates speed. SO indicates that the animal is im·
mobile. 51 indicates normal or ordinary speed; 52 indicates
double speed; S3 indicates triple speed; S4 indicates qua·
druple speed.
The animal characteristics table indicates die rolls to
derive these three characteristics.
Referee's Additions: The referee may invent new animal
characteristics within this system. Larger or smaller animals
may be invented, extrapolating from the system presented.
Other animal weaponry and armor types may be invented;
the easiest to implement are those already found on the
weapons matrix, with or without OMs, such as cloth-1
(cloth minus 1 ), ablat+1, foil, stinger-1, and so on.
Animals may also be provided with more complex
motivations than the simple dice rolls for attack and flight.
The animal type descriptions later in this chapter will prove
helpful in this regard. Carnivores will base their decisions
on the sizes of the party and of individuals. Large herbi·
vores will be less likely to flee than small ones, tending to
ignore a party unless it approaches too close. Humans may
resemble a carnivore's natural prey or a herbivore's natural
predator. Any animal may attack if the party threatens its
young, nest, territory, or meal. Any animal may flee if
startled or if the party appears sufficiently threatening;
even the most vicious carnivore is reluctant to risk its life
for a meal.
Other responses are possible beyond attack or flight. A
carnivore may stalk a party, hoping to attack an isolated
91

92
Animal Encounters
member. An armored animal may curl up into a ball or
retract its extremities into its shell. Animals may ·find
certain parts of the group's equipment attractive, and fasten
themselves to the outside of an ATV or try to eat clothing.
There may be responses analogous to that of the skunk or
the opossum. An animal may be friendly or want to play; it
might even mistake a party for members of the opposite sex.
Common Sense: Airless worlds will almost never have
any life of consequence on them; if they do, animal life
will still tend to follow the same broad guidelines given
above. Still, flyers and liquid breathers will be almost
non-existent.
The referee should always be prepared to alter or re·
strain prescribed procedures if it is felt that they contravene
logic or reason.
USING THE ENCOUNTER TABLES
Each day, an adventuring band may possibly have one or
more encounters with some animal life forms. As a general
rule, the referee will check for an encounter once while the
band is travelling and once while the band is halted (for
rest, exercise, encampment, or whatever). There is a one·
third chance (throw 5 or 6 on one die) that an animal
encounter will occur in any of the specified terrain types.
Referee-initiated modifications to this frequency may be
instituted to cover greater or smaller probabilities based on
planetary or local conditions.
In addition, specific encounters at specific locations are
always possible. For example, the referee may already have
populated a location (perhaps a ruin) with specific animals.
These are not subject to normal random encounter rules.
Procedure: Twice each day, the referee will throw to
determine if an encounter occurs. If a band splits tempor·
arily, each portion of the band should be liable for an
independent encounter. When an encounter does occur,
the correct (based on terrain type) encounter column is
then used to ascertain the class, type, quantity, and charac·
teristics of the animal encountered (in some circumstances
the encounter column may indicate that a non-animal
event has been encountered instead). Any situation which
Game Designers' Workshop
calls for combat uses the personal combat system already
presented.
Special Effects: Animal encounters constitute the only
general possibility of access that characters have to food,
furs, or other valuable items. Guides may be hired or
present for the purpose of assisting in the location of
specific animals, contributing a OM of +2 or greater to
influence encounter throws for a specific type of animal.
Animals are usually edible (throw 5+ to be edible, OM -3 if
the atmosphere is tainted) provided the planetary atmosphere
is between 2 and 9, and the animal does not have a
poison weapon. Otherwise, the animal is inedible. From
5% to 30% (throw one die times 5%) of an animal's weight
will be edible meat. A person requires one kilogram of meat
per day when living off the hunt.
Animal Descriptions: The referee may elect to describe
animals in order to allow a better image in the adventurers'
minds. The basic system may be used without this aspect,
but descriptions such as lion·like, amoeboid, canine, or
others may prove useful.
ANIMAL DEFINITIONS
The following definitions more fully detail the meanings
of the descriptive terms used for animal categories, types,
and events.
Herbivores: Animals which eat unresisting food are
generally classed as herbivores. While this is usually con·
strued as covering plant eaters, the definition is extended
here to cover the eating of unresisting animals as well.
For example, the anteater and the whale eat effectively
unresisting animals (ants and krill) and should be classified
as herbivores. Herbivores are of three types:
Grazers: Animals which devote most of their time to
eating are termed grazers. They may be solitary or grouped
in herds. Their primary defense is flight, although such
action may result in stampedes which could endanger
adventurers in their path. When forced to fight, they will
fight fiercely until killed or routed. Typical [[Terra|Terran]] grazers
are the antelope and the moose. The whale (which scoops
krill from the sea as it swims through it) is also a grazer.
lntermittents: Herbivores which do not devote full time
to eating are termed intermittents. They tend to be solitary.
lntermittents usually freeze when an encounter occurs,
fleeing if attacked by a larger animal. There is some poten·
tial that an intermittent will attack to protect territory or
young. Typical [[Terra|Terran]] intermittents are the chipmunk and
the elephant.
Filters: Herbivores which pass the environment through
their bodies are termed filters. Unlike grazers, which move
to food, filters move a flow of water or air through them·
selves in order to gain food. Generally, filters suck, trip,
push, or pull anything (even animals) at close range into a
digestive sac, inflicting automatic wounds of 1 D per 50 kg
or less of animal mass (wound alteration should be ignored
for filters). Filters are solitary and generally slow-moving.
They will attack reflexively (as indicated above), succeeding
against adventurers with a throw of 6+. Prompt struggle by
adventurers (at a cost of one endurance point each) will
secure an escape on a throw of 7+, OM of +2 for each
companion assisting at close range. Throw once per combat

The Traveller Book
round, beginning on the round following the attack. A filter
can absorb an animal u:p to twice its own weight. [[Terra|Terran]]
filters are generally aquatic, such as the barnacle.
Omnivores: Animals which eat food without regard to
its resistance are termed omnivores. The bear, which will
eat fruits and berries as readily as it will hunt for animals, is
an omnivore. Omnivores are of three types: gatherers,
hunters, and eaters.
Gatherers: Animals which display a greater tendency
toward herbivorous behavior are termed gatherers. In most
respects, they are similar to intermittents. Typical [[Terra|Terran]]
gatherers are the raccoon and the chimpanzee.
Hunters: Animals which display a greater tendency
toward carnivorous behavior are termed hunters. In most
respects, they are similar to small or inefficient chasers.
Typical [[Terra|Terran]] hunters are bears or humans.
Eaters: The true omnivore (in the sense that it will eat
anything and everything) does not distinguish its food,
consuming all that it confronts. Eaters present considerable
danger in that they will not avoid adventurers when en·
countered. A typical [[Terra|Terran]] eater is the army ant (when an
entire swarm is considered to be one organism).
Carnivores: Animals which prey on other animals by
attacking and killing them in the face of resistance are
classed as carnivores. Carnivores are of five basic types:
pouncers, chasers, trappers, sirens, and killers.
Pouncers: Animals which kill their prey by attacking
from hiding, or by stalking and springing, are termed
pouncers. Because of the difficulty of coordinating such
attacks, pouncers are usually solitary animals. In an en·
counter, pouncers which have achieved surprise have
succeeded in their basic aim and will attack regardless of
range. If they do not have surprise, they will sometimes still
attack. They will flee if they themselves are surprised.
Typical [[Terra|Terran]] pouncers are cats.
Chasers: An imals which kill their prey by attacking after
a chase are termed chasers. They tend to be pack animals.
Typical chasers are wolves.
Trappers: Animals which passively allow their prey to
enter a created trap wherein they are killed and then eaten
are termed trappers. Trappers tend to be solitary and
slow, but will attack amy animal which enters their trap.
Generally, any character who is surprised by a trapper at
close or short range is then trapped on a throw of 5+.
Struggling to escape (in lieu of making any swings or
blows, but costing one endurance point) succeeds on a
throw of 9+, DM of +1 for each assisting companion.
Companions are subject to capture by the trap while
providing assistance. Usually, a trap will not wound or
damage a character, but will tend to hold the adventurer to
allow the trapper to attempt to kill him. A typical [[Terra|Terran]]
trapper is the spider; less typical is the ant lion.
Siren: Distinct from the trapper, which creates a trap for
its prey, a siren also creates a lure to draw prey to the trap.
The trap is treated in much the same manner as that of
the trapper, but the lure entails additional consideration. In
most cases, the lure will be specific to some animal, but will
be unnoticed by humans. In rare cases (throw 11+), the lure
will be universal, perhaps a smell or scent, or a mirage or
beautiful configuration, which will attract characters into a
Animal Encounters
vulnerable position. Very rarely, the lure will be psionic in
nature. Typical [[Terra|Terran]] sirens are the angler fish (its mouth
is the trap) and the venus fly trap.
Killers: Certain carnivores devote much attention to
killing, apparently for the act itself, in a kind of blood lust.
Killers' reason (such as territorial defense) is replaced by a
raw killing instinct. Attacks by killers are fierce and violent.
Killers will generally disregard the defender's size as a
factor. The typical [[Terra|Terran]] killer is the shark.
Scavengers: Animals which share or steal the prey of
others, or that take the remains of kills, are classed as
scavengers. Scavengers are of four types: intimidators,
hijackers, carrion-eaters, and reducers.
Intimidators: Scavengers which establish their claim to
food by frightening or threatening other animals are termed
intimidators. Their standard procedure is to approach a kill
and force other animals away by appearing to be a threat. A
typical [[Terra|Terran]] intimidator is the coyote.
Hijackers: Scavengers which establish their claim to food
by simply taking it are termed hijackers. They rely on their
superior strength or size to allow them to hijack food be·
cause the other animals present cannot effectively object. A
typical [[Terra|Terran]] hijacker is the lion or the Tyrannosaurus rex.
Carrion-Eaters: Scavengers which take dead meat when
it becomes available (often waiting patiently for all other
threats to disperse before beginning) are termed carrion·
eaters. Most typical of [[Terra|Terran]] carrion-eaters is the buzzard.
Reducers: Scavengers which act constantly on all avail·
able food are termed reducers. They eat the remains of
food after all other scavengers are finished with it, con·
suming bone and other leavings. [[Terra|Terran]] reducers are all
microscopic, such as bacteria.

The Traveller Book
Animal Characteristics
This table indicates the behavior
which may be expected by any
specific animal. Determine animal
category and type. Roll once in each
column (to attack, to flee, and
typical speed); the result is the throw
(on two dice) that that specific
animal type must make to attack or
flee (otherwise the animal does
nothing) . . The number for speed is
the multiplier times ordinary speed.
For example, for a grazer, roll to
determine attack; one die is rolled,
with a result of 6 (+2=8), so the
animal will attack on a roll of 8+
when encountered. To determine the
throw to flee, one die is rolled, for a
3 (-1=2). so the animal will flee on a
roll of 2+. The speed die roll is a 4
(- 2=2), so the animal has double
ordinary speed.
Note that the rolls to determine
these numbers use one die, but in all
cases, they then represent two-dice
rolls when used on the animal
encounter tables.
Formatting: Each roll is generally
a single digit, and should be followed
by the letter A (for attack), F (for
flee), or S (for speed). For example,
A6 F7 S2 indicates an animal that
will attack on 6+, flee on 7+ if it has
not already attacked, and will have a
speed of double ordinary.
In some cases (where phrases are
given above) animals will behave
according to the situation. The
number used should be 0 to indicate
a special case.
If possible indicates that a filter
will attack if it possibly can.
If surprise indicates that the
animal will attack if it has surprise.
If surprised indicates that the
animal will flee if surprised.
If more indicates that the animal
will attack if there are more of it
than there are potential prey.
Herbivores: Most animals will
attack before they flee, so the order
of codes should be A F S; herbivores
will probably flee first, so they
should be coded F A S.

Animal Encounters
EVENTS
In addition to animals, the referee may include one or
more events in his encounter tables. An event may be
almost anything: an unusual animal not covered adequately
by the standard format, an interesting terrain feature,
weather, even a natural disaster. An event's purpose is to
add interest, atmosphere, and perhaps a bit of danger to the
adventurers' travels. Events should be specifically tailored
to the terra in in which they occur, and should take into
account the nature of the party, its weapons, and its vehi·
cles. A number of sample events are given below. In order
to present as many ideas as possible, the descriptions of
individual events are short; a referee's complete description
of an event may require more information.
Animals
An event is a convenient form to use in describing an
unusual animal ; the animal's statistics, in standard format,
may follow the description, or the event may describe
unusual behavior by an animal found elsewhere on the
table. An event may also describe the animal 's lair or
spoor, rather than the animal itself.
Chameleon: These animals are very well camouflaged. If
the animal chooses to attack, the encounter will take place
at close range and the animal will have surprise; otherwise,
there will be no encounter.
Psionic Assaulters: Telepathic carnivores attack the
party. All persons are attacked by psionic assault as explain·
ed in the psionics rules. During the attack, the creatures will
remain hidden within 50 meters of the party, emerging only
if most of the party is incapacitated.
Circling Flyers: A number of flyers spot the party and
circle above their heads. After about 10 minutes the party
will be attacked by chasers. The animals are symbiotic: the
flyers spot prey for the chasers, and are allowed to share in
the feast.
Poisonous Pests: While the party was stopped, tiny
(1 gram) creatures have crawled into concealed places with·
in the party's equipment (packs, boots, etc.). They are
poisonous, and attack when encountered (when a character
Game Designers' Workshop
reaches into his pack, puts on his boots, etc.), doing 30
damage unless the character makes a saving throw of dex·
terity or less.
Stampede: A herd of grazers, frightened by carnivores,
stampedes into the party. They can be turned by loud
noises (gunshots, explosions) or laser bolts. Otherwise, they
will run straight through the party. Each individual must
roll 8+ to avoid 20 accidental damage.
Rutting Season: A large, normally harmless herbivore
mistakes the party's ATV for a rival and charges. Throw
10+ each combat round, OM + driver's skill, to avoid a
collision. The ATV will be damaged and rendered immobile
until repaired on 9+ per collision.
Lair: The party comes upon a large burrow, in which
there are five immature pouncers. They are not dangerous,
but if the party remains in the area more than a few min·
utes, the mother will return and attack immediately.
Plants
Although plants will generally remain just part of the
scenery, some may be interesting or dangerous enough to
qualify as events.
Hallucinogenic Pollen: The party comes upon a field of
flowers. The air is filled with their pollen, which will cause
strong hallucinations if breathed. The hallucinations,
threatening in nature, will continue for about 20 minutes
after the party leaves the field.
Carnivorous Plants: Apparently solid ground collapses
beneath the lead member of the party and he falls into a
circular pit 4 meters deep; the walls are covered with
downward-projecting spikes and there is 1 meter of liquid
at the bottom. This is a digestive organ grown by nearby
trees, and if the character is not rescued within a few
minutes, the liquid will begin to digest him.
Wirebushes: The party comes to an area filled with low
bushes. Their branches are very tough, and if the party tries
to drive through, their ATV's tracks will be entangled,
requiring 20 man-hours to free. Bypassing the area will add
half an hour to travel time.
Weather
Various types of weather may endanger a party or
impede its progress.
Dense Fog: The party encounters a low area filled with a
dense fog. Visibility is reduced to medium range, and safe
travel is reduced to half speed.
Sandstorm: High winds fill the air with abrasive sand
particles. Progress will be impossible for 12 hours. lndividu·
als will be buried, and vehicle windscreens will be abraded
into translucence.
Cold Snap: The ambient temperature falls rapidly.
Individuals must obtain shelter or lose 2 points of endur·
ance per hour.
Tornado: A tornado is heading toward the party. If it
achieves surprise, or the party does not act to avoid its
path once it is sighted, it will destroy their vehicle and
inflict 30 hits on each member of the group.
Rainstorm: A sudden rainstorm reduces visibility and
turns the ground to thick mud. Travel is slowed to quarter
speed for the day.

The Traveller Book
Natural Disasters
These make good events if used sparingly. The more
violent events will serve to warn travellers away from
certain terrain types, and enough warning should be given
to allow a clever party to escape.
Prairie Fire: A line of fire can be seen on the horizon.
The fire is 20 km across and must be detoured around.
Animals fleeing the fire will ignore the party unless their
escape path is blocked. Detour will take 4 hours; roll for 3
encounters during that time.
Flash Flood: A wall of water rushes along the river bed,
sweeping all before it. The party must get to high ground
before the flood reaches them. Vehicles roll 10+ to avoid
destruction; individuals roll 9+ to avoid being carried several
km downstream, suffering 30 points of damage.
Volcano: A nearby volcano erupts, and the party must
flee or be overcome by poisonous gases. After the eruption,
ash and lava flow have sealed the mountain pass, preventing
forward progress.
Seismic Quake: A seismic disturbance shakes the ground.
Each adventurer must throw strength or less to avoid being
thrown to the ground, taking 1 D points damage.
Terrain Features
Adventurers may encounter variations in the local
terrain, too small to show up on planetary maps.
Broken Ground: The terrain becomes very rough; the
ATV must slow to quarter speed or risk a track breakdown
(throw 6+ per hour to avoid).
Oasis: The party approaches an oasis, with a pool of
water surrounded by heavy vegetation. Throw 8+ for the
water to be drinkable. If it is not, moisture may still be
recovered from reservoirs inside one species of plants.
Crevasse: A deep crevasse blocks forward progress, and
20 hours will be required to detour around it.
Radiation Area: An area in the forest is devoid of life,
and a geiger counter will show very high levels of radiation
near the center. Individuals who spend more than 10
minutes in the area will suffer from radiation sickness,
taking 1 point of damage, every day for the next two weeks,
for each 10 minutes spent in the area; for instance, a character
who spends an hour in the area will take 6 points of
damage each day for two weeks.
Quicksand: Throw dexterity or less to avoid becoming
trapped. If trapped, throw strength or less each round to
escape. If a companion is able to help (by extending a rope,
branch, etc.), OM +3. If the adventurer does not escape
within 10 rounds, he drowns.
Ford: Sandbars in the river create a shallow area, allowing
vehicles to cross.
Curiosities
Some events may have no importance whatsoever, merely
providing atmosphere to an adventure.
Statues: The party finds a large stone statue, half buried;
the torso is human but the head is that of a local carnivore.
Natives of the area, if consulted, will state that such finds
are common and will give varying opinions of their origin.
Jungle Drums: Distant drums are heard at night; periodically
they fall silent and are answered from another direc-
Animal Encounters
tion. If the party investigates, they may be able to discover
that these are the mating calls of a large omnivore.
Marsh Gas: Moving lights are seen in the distance, apparently
following the party. They may temporarily be mistaken
for the running lights of an air/raft.
Vacuum Worlds
Encounter tables for vacuum worlds (or any world without
life) must be largely composed of events.
Dust Pool: Micro-fine dust fills a crater. If any character
walks though the pool, throw 10+ for a vacc suit malfunction
to occur from dust contamination. If dust enters the
party's vehicle (carried in on a character's vacc suit) throw
10+ every hour for malfunction of some element of the
vehicle's electronic circuitry.
Solar Storm: Increased solar activity makes radio communication
impossible for several days.
Magnetic Anomaly: A large underground metal deposit
deflects compass readings by up to 60 degrees. Travellers
who do not notice this will be steered off course.
Tracks: ATV tracks cross the party's path. If the party
follows them in the right direction, they will be led eventu·
ally to civilization.
Pressure Tent: The party comes upon a small inflatable
shelter of the type used by prospectors. There is breathable
air inside, but no light or heat, as the shelter's power pack
has run down. The owner's body may be found (if anyone
undertakes a lengthy search) under a rockslide several
hundred meters away.
Greater Complexities: Events may be used to trigger
rolls on special encounter tables; for example, if an event
describes a forest clearing, a special table may be made up
to handle encounters in that clearing. An event may be
made specifically applicable to an adventure in which a
party is involved; for example, if a party is prospecting the
location of a mineral outcropping could be an event. Events
may trigger small adventures, separate from the main
adventure; for example, an event could consist of the
exploration of a cave previously mapped by the referee.

Encounters
Encounters are the prime focus in Traveller. Through them, player characters meet and interact with non-player charac·
ters (NPCs), events, animals, and other interesting phenomena. The direction and the tone of adventures is inevitably
influenced by the types of individuals encountered in the course of the adventurer's travels. Encounters are of seven basic
types: routine, random, rumor, legal, patron, adventure, and animal. The referee determines what type of encounter is
probable, and determines or decides if it occurs. If there is an encounter, the appropriate details are generated, and the
encounter is presented to the players. During the course of an encounter, the referee builds the situation, presents any
appropriate reactions, and administers any activity that may be called for. In any encounter, the events may lead to friendship,
a business relationship, antipathy and violence, or indifference.
Encounters with non-player characters serve as the referee's vehicle for direction and input during adventures. The proper
presentation of non-player characters can provide players with transportation, information, or other assistance if reactions
are appropriate. Non-player characters can also use violence (or the threat of violence) to redirect activity toward more
reasonable goals.
Encounter Tables: A wide variety of encounter tables are useful to the referee as a prod to the imagination and an aid to
the efficient management of an adventure. Encounter tables are presented in the set of encounter charts and tables. Other
tables oriented toward a specific Traveller adventure or campaign may be generated by the referee.
Because of their nature, animal encounters are handled in a separate chapter.
ROUTINE ENCOUNTERS
Adventurers meet ordinary people in the course of
ordinary activity. In many cases, adventurers actually
ignore the persons (and are themselves little noticed),
concentrating on their current activity instead. Personal
reactions are rarely of importance, and the encountered
individual merely performs his or her duties. For example,
an encounter with a store clerk in the course of buying
equipment is rarely of importance, and the process usually
continues without trouble.
Routine encounters occur as called for by the situation
and at the discretion of the referee.
Clerks: The most common form of routine encounter is
the clerk. When an adventurer enters a store to buy equipment,
a shop to procure repairs, or a restaurant to buy a
meal, the clerk is a routine encounter. There should be no
problem in achieving the stated goal, and the clerk or waiter
will perform the job adequately. if not perfectly. It is not
necessary for the adventurer to know the UPP of the clerk,
or even deal with the clerk at any great length.
At times, the otherwise routine encounter may be used
by the referee to further the events of the adventure. In
such cases, the encounter is no longer routine; it is instead a
random encounter, or an adventure encounter.
Employees and Hirelings: One form of routine en·
counter is the employment interview where the adventurers
are the potential employers. When travellers themselves
need employees (for any purpose, from bodyguards to crewmembers),
they must find them in the course of their
activities. Advertising, visiting local union hiring halls, or
actively spreading the word at local establishments are all
possibilities for the location of potential hirelings. The
referee, in response to this activity, must then generate
several non-player characters and present them as applicants
for employment. The interview consists of the presentation
of the character's UPP and skill levels. The player characters
then decide whether to hire or not based on the information
presented. Of course, applicants will be limited (perhaps
1 D; one to six applicants per week), and the adventurers
cannot be too choosy.
RANDOM ENCOUNTERS
Adventurers, as they travel about on planets, also have
random encounters with an unpredictable variety of in·
dividuals or groups. Such individuals are themselves performing
various tasks, which may complement, supplement,
oppose, or be irrelevant to the goals of the adventurers
themselves. Some random encounters are mandated by the
referee in order to add adventure or spice to a situation.
Random encounters are primarily dictated by the
random encounter matrix. Random encounters may occur
as frequently as daily ; each day the referee should throw to
determine if a random encounter has occurred (throw
5+ on 1 D for a random encounter). Random encounters
may occur only if there is a local population to provide
the individuals who will form the encounter.
If a random encounter is called for, throw two dice and
consult the random encounter matrix. The result indicates
the specific encounter on the random encounter list.
The list provided is only an example, and other lists may be
generated for specific adventures or situations. For example,
if the adventuring group is on a world embroiled in a civil
war, the random encounter list might be full of troops,
refugees, guerrillas, war profiteers, petty warlords, and
members of various factions. The remarks column of the
random encounter list indicates details of the group which
is encountered. Unless contradicted by the remarks, the
group can be assumed to be unarmored, armed only with
blade weapons, on foot, and at the tech level of the current
world. If the remarks direct, the referee should equip the
group with weapons, armor, and vehicles appropriate to the
local tech level. Some groups may have leaders; a leader is

The Traveller Book
assumed to be armed with a gun and to be armored con·
sistent with local tech level. In all cases, only military
troops and leaders will wear combat armor or battle dress.
Reactions are an important part of random encounters.
Once the encounter occurs, the referee should consult the
reaction table to determine the specific response to the
encounter by the other side.
RUMORS
Information is a valuable commodity to travellers, and
rumors are the source of much useful information. The
term rumor is a catchword covering a wide variety of
presentations of information. Rumors may be newspaper or
broadcast information; they may be conversations over·
heard on public transport, or in local eating establishments;
they may be bits and pieces brought together by the
listener. In any case, the idea of the rumor allows the player
characters to learn of new, exciting, and potentially re·
warding (or potentially deadly) situations. In many
Traveller situations, a rumor is simply information leading
to a patron, a job, or a potential treasure; in Traveller
adventures or campaigns, rumors serve to educate and
direct the player characters toward the essential basis of the
adventure.
Rumors are faceless. The player character's own decision
to act on a rumor makes him or her responsible for the
results. There is no one to pin the blame on if the rumor
proves false. Rumors are untraceable. No one can definitely
point to the source of a rumor and state that it originally
began there. Rumors are, in effect, absent patrons, providing
information that allows player characters to act, and
having once acted, to win or lose on their own merits.
The referee should throw once per week to determine if
a rumor is encountered (throw 7+ on 20 for a rumor to be
encountered). If a rumor is found, throw two dice and
consult the rumors matrix for the specific rumor involved.
The rumors list presents a variety of rumor types. The
referee may invent rumors once a rumor is dictated by the
list; in the case of specific adventures or campaigns, the
referee may determine beforehand that some information is
of use to the player characters, and write out a rumors list
for the specific situation.
Rumors are valuable, and once player characters know
of their potential, they will seek them out. Ultimately,
all rumors should be available to the player characters, but
they should be doled out slowly in order to insure each
rumor is dealt with and understood (if possible).
LEGAL ENCOUNTERS
The law level of each world determines the degree of
permissiveness or oppres.sion which prevails. In addition to
stating what weaponry is or is not allowed, law level ad·
dresses the problem of harassment by local enforcers or
police. Permissive worlds allow individuals to settle their
own differences and to protect themselves. The likelihood
of the local police bothering anyone is remote. On op·
pressive worlds, the local enforcers are charged with great
responsibility and spend much of their time protecting local
law and order. As a result, they are much more likely to
stop and question strangers, often reducing this procedure
Encounters
to a simple form of harassment.
The referee should throw once per day for legal en·
counters (throw local law level or less to avoid an en·
counter). If an encounter is called for, a local enforcer will
stop the adventurers and require identification. The referee
should roll for the enforcer's reaction as well, using adverse
reactions as an indication of greater harassment, and
positive reactions as a potential source of rumors, assist·
ance, or patrons.
PATRONS
The key to adventure in Traveller is the patron. When a
band of adventurers meets an appropriate patron, they have
a person who can give them direction in their activities, and
who can reward them for success. The patron is the single
most important non-player character possible.
A patron will, if he or she decides to hire a band of
adventurers, specify a task or deed to be performed, and
then finance reasonable expenses for the pursuit of that
task. Some tasks are ordinary in nature, such as employ·
ment as armed guards or escorts; other tasks may include
the location and procurement of items of great value.
Generally, a patron's agreement with a band of adventurers
will specify that the patron will receive the item he or she is
seeking while all other goods or items acquired will belong
to the adventurers. Other possible agreements may call for
the adventurers to receive shares in the total profit of the
venture, from which their current salaries will be de·
ducted.
Whenever the player characters do not have a patron and
they are seeking one, the referee should roll once per
week (throw 5+ on 1 D for a patron encounter to occur).
If one does occur, consult the patron encounters matrix.
Before roll ing on the matrix, the referee should determine
which patron list will be used. Two lists are provided in
the encounter tables; in the case of a specific adventure or
campaign, the referee may create a special patron list which
will more closely reflect the situation in the game. For
example, if the current adventure centers on exploration
and survey of a poorly charted subsector, then the range of
patrons might include merchants anxious for trade fran·
chises or news of new markets, mercenaries looking for
new wars to fight, smugglers in search of goods, and govern·
ment officials attempting to restrain access to the new area.
The listed patron is usually identified by occupation.
The referee should create an appropriate non-player charac·
ter and decide on a mission that the patron will want
completed. The situation is then presented to the player
characters, reactions determined, and the game proceeds.
ADVENTURE ENCOUNTERS
Often, the player characters acquire a goal and then
proceed to accomplish it. In the course of this activity, they
are necessarily thrown into contact with a wide variety
of individuals who are somehow related to the mission.
Such individuals cannot occur randomly, as they depend on
the actions of the player characters and on the details of
the situation. Such encounters are called adventure en·
counters, a.nd are generated by the referee as required.

Encounters
ENCOUNTERS
Encounters occur constantly, and
represent the primary means of player·
character interaction with others.
There are seven basic types of
encounters:
Routine
Random
Rumor
Legal
Patron
Adventure
Animal
ROUTINE ENCOUNTERS
Ordinary people, performing their
routine jobs, form the routine
encounters to be expected. Examples
are clerks in stores or offices. Routine
encounters generally have no effect on
characters' activities.
Routine encounters occur when
necessary.
LEGAL ENCOUNTERS
Characters may expect to be
harassed or bothered by local law en·
forcement officials in direct relation to
the local law level.
Throw local law level or less once
per day to avoid an interview with a
law enforcement official protecting
local society.
ANIMAL ENCOUNTERS
Characters may expect, when out·
side of urban areas, to encounter ex·
amples of local animal life.
Animal encounter tables are
generated under the rules provided in
the animal encounter chapter.
Throw twice per day as directed by
the animal encounter table for the
local terrain type and world.
ADVENTURE ENCOUNTERS
Characters, in the course of their
adventures, may encounter individuals
who are part of the events of the ad·
venture. Such individuals may be
guards for an estate being invaded, a
professor in a laboratory being clandestinely
observed, a financier being
rescued from kidnappers, or the kid·
nappers themselves.
Encounters which are direct parts
of a scenario or adventure are managed
by the referee in accordance with his
or her determinations of actions,
motivations, and preferences.
ENCOUNTER CHECKLIST
Encounters take place on a re·
curring basis. The following checklist
is a gu ide to their frequency.
Routine: As necessary.
Adventure: As necessary.
Legal: Daily throw law level or less
to avoid legal harassment.
Random: Daily throw 5+ (on 1 D)
for a random encounter to take place.
Animal: Daily throw as directed on
animal encounter table for terrain and
world type.
Patron: Weekly throw 5+ (on 1 D)
for patron to be encountered.
Rumor: Weekly throw 7+ (on 20)
for a rumor to be encountered.

A Rumor Matrix OMs
A The referee, when constructing a
rumor matrix, must take into account
the possible differences in character
types and their predisposition to receiving
specific types of rumors.
Specific OMs on the matrix may be
established.

Remarks: All encountered individuals have necessary survival equipment such as vacc suits, filter masks, or respirators,
regardless of local tech level (equipment may be assumed to be imported if necessary). Unless otherwise stated, all individuals
are armed with blades (not guns), unarmored, and are on foot.
Abbreviations indicate special equipment levels for the encounter. L: a leader is present; he or she will have the best
possible equipment for the tech level. G: the group is armed with guns. A: the group wears armor. V: the group has a
vehicle consistent with local tech level (vehicle includes riding animals). -N (where N is any number): tech level for the
group is that number lower than local tech level. +N (where N is any number): tech level for the group is that number
greater than local tech level.

102
Encounters
For example, if the travellers have acquired a patron
(a financier whose daughter has been kidnapped), and
they accept the patron's mission (rescue the daughter),
then many of the encounters to come will be dictated by
the situation. These are adventure encounters. They may
include interviews with witnesses, discussions with police or
private investigators, observations of likely suspects, conversations
with data librarians, observations of guards at the
kidnappers' hideout, and rescue of the daughter herself. No
table of random events or personalities can provide these
individuals; the referee must produce them in anticipation
of, or in response to, the player characters' actions.
ANIMAL ENCOUNTERS
The animal life to be encountered on various alien
worlds may pose dangers to the adventurers, and animal
encounter tables based on world type and terrain type are
used to determine what kinds of animals may be met and
how they will react.
The referee should roll for an animal encounter twice
per day as instructed on the animal encounter table for
the specific local terrain.
Game Designers' Workshop
Animal encounter tables are produced using the
generation system shown in the chapter on animal encounters.
REACTIONS
When non-player characters are encountered, their
reactions will dictate their activity in terms of business
deals, violence, assistance, charity, cooperation, and a
number of other actions. When an encounter occurs, throw
two dice and consult the reaction table. Dice throws of 2
and 12 (exactly) are not subject to OMs; any other result is
subject to OMs, modified results of less than 3 becoming
3 and greater than 12 becoming 12.
The following general OMs apply; others may be called
for by a specific situation. If a character has served 5 or
more terms in the army, navy, marines, or scouts, OM +1. If
planetary population is 9 or greater, OM - 1.
Reaction throws are made upon initial encounter, and
one throw determines the reaction of an entire group.
Reactions are used by the referee and by players as a
guide to the probable actions of individuals. They determine
responses to business offers or deals (admin or bribery
expertise serves as a OM). Reactions govern the reliability
and quality of hirelings and employees. Generally, they
would re-roll reactions in the face of bad treatment or
dangerous tasks.
Note that the reactions are expressed in general terms,
and that they require interpretation by the referee. For
example, attacks by reacting characters may not be physi·
cal; they may instead be verbal or psychological, depending
on local law level, the situation, and the appropriateness of
the action to the character.

REFEREE'S RESPONSIBILITIES
In administering any encounter, the referee must be
responsible for the details of the situation and of the
encountered non-player characters. The encounter charts
and tables include synopses of available weapons and
armor by tech level, and available weapons by law level.
The player characters, as they become familiar with the
rules for Traveller, will come to expect certain levels of
weaponry and equipment at various law levels and tech
levels. Such familiarity is to be expected and allows them
to cope with the role-playing aspects of the Traveller
system. The referee must insure that the encountered
NPCs are properly equipped and consistent with the rules
that the players know. That is not to say that encounters
cannot be equipped above a local tech level or law level, but
there should be a definite reason (special permission from
local authorities ; imported or smuggled equipment; military
issue) for any inconsistency.
Additional Tables: The various encounter tables have
been presented in such a way that the referee can easily
produce additional lists or tables in order to vary the types
of encounters to be expected. Such variation is a positive
addition in that it makes the universe the player characters
adventure in more diverse.
Checklist: The encounter checklist provides a quick
guide to the expected frequency of encounters during a
scenario, adventure, or campaign.

Experience
Characters already know their basic physical and mental parameters: their basic educational and physical development
have already occurred, and further improvement can only take place through dedicated endeavor. Experience gained as the
character travels and adventures is, in a very real sense, an increased ability to play the role which he or she has assumed.
Self-Improvement: Limited personal development and experience is possible in the sense of increasing abilities and skills.
Such potential for increases is possible in four specific areas, only one of which may be attempted at one time: education,
weapon expertise, physical fitness, and other skills.
In each field, the character selects a four-year program of self-improvement, dedicating his or her endeavors in something
like obsession. Because individuals do not always have the will to carry out such a program, there is the chance that it will
be planned, but never carried out. After the general field has been chosen, the character must make a dedication die roll.
Throw 8+; no OMs apply except for the physical fitness program, in which case allow a OM of +2 if intelligence is 8-, +4 if
intelligence 5-. Failure to achieve this throw indicates that the program is not carried out, and a new one may not be
attempted for at least one year. Success in the throw indicates that the program is undertaken.
The pursuit of any program envisions that the required materials are available on a regular basis. Weapons training requires
the weapons specified; tutoring requires a tutor. If the required materials are not available, the program is suspended
temporarily, but the benefits are not lost if the suspension is of less than three months duration.
EDUCATION
A character with education lower than intelligence may
improve education through correspondence courses and
tutoring. Such courses (or tutors) have a base price of CR
50 per week; one session per week is taken, though two per
week are possible. Fifty sessions increase education by
one. In any four year period, education may be increased a
maximum of six levels. Education increases are permanent.
Sabbatical: Any character may, once during his or her
life, take a sabbatical (for four years) for the purpose of
specifically gaining a skill through education. Such activity
is the equivalent of a technical school or college education,
and allows the acquisition of one specific non-weapon skill
with a level of 2. Cost of this education is Cr70,000.
WEAPON EXPERTISE
A character's skill in a weapon is native trained abil ity ;
additional training and dedicated practice with specific
weapons may provide better levels on a temporary basis.
Skilled marksmen achieve their best work when at the peak
of their training. One gun and one blade may be chosen;
skill in each is increased by 1 for the duration of the
program. If the character has skill-0 in the chosen weapon,
that weapon skill is increased to 1, permanently. At the end
of this program, skill· increases are lost unless the program is
extended or continued formally for another four years.
After a second four year program, the improved skill level
becomes permanent. This permanent level may then itself
be temporarily improved by further programs. Any weapons
may be chosen for this program, and one or both
weapons may be dropped for new ones in later program.
For example, Johnson has skills of foil-0 and revolver-3,
and chooses to practice in these weapons. After successfully
making his throw of 8+ for dedication to purpose, his skill
levels for these weapons become foil-1 and revolver-3 if he
does not continue his program of training. Johnson successfully
makes his dedication throw of 8+ again, and continues
in these two weapons. His skill level becomes foil-2 and
revolver-4. At the end of that four year program, he elects
to abandon this self-improvement for another program, and
his weapons skills revert to foil-1 and (because he has spent
a second four year program on revolver) revolver-4.
When new or exotic weapons become available (especially
those not described in character generation). it is possible
to acquire skill in them through this training program.
SKILL IMPROVEMENT
A character may temporarily improve h is skill in another
field by dedicating himself to it for a program of 4 years
duration. Only two skills may be chosen, and the individual
must already have at least skill-1 in each skill. Skill level
reverts to the original level at the end of the program. If the
program continues for a second four years, the new skill
level becomes permanent at the end of that time.
PHYSICAL FITNESS
Strict physical training can increase individual physical
characteristics. If the dedication throw is made, strength,
dexterity, and endurance are increased by 1. This increase
remains in effect for the duration of the physical fitness
program. Physical characteristics may never be increased to
more than 15.
ALTERNATIVES
The above situations are the only ordinary methods of
self-improvement available to characters. Highly scientific
or very esoteric methods of improving personal skills and
characteristics are logically available, provided the individuals
search hard enough for them. Such methods could
include RNA intelligence or education implants, surgical
alteration, military or mercenary training, and other
systems.
Such alternatives to the above methods must be administered
by the referee.

Trade and Commerce
Although most commercial starships routinely carry cargos as common carriers, charging a flat rate of Cr1,000 per ton
for the service, many also engage in speculation by buying goods at low prices, transporting them in spare cargo space, and
then selling them for higher prices in markets anxious to have them.
A reasonably comprehensive listing of trade goods and speculation items is presented in the trade and speculation table.
Some of the trade goods may provide a smaller return than Cr1,000 per ton, but still enough to relieve the burden of
shipping empty hold space. All listed trade goods have a specified base price which indicates the absolute value of the goods
on a constant scale. The actual value table indicates the price such goods may be purchased for, by showing a percentage
modification to the base price. Upon arriving at a potential market, the selling price may also be determined as a percentage
of the base price (not actual purchase price) .
PROCEDURE
A trader with cargo space available and free capital with
which to speculate may seek out suitable goods to buy and
sell. Throw two dice, noting their results consecutively, to
create a number between 11 and 66; OM +1 on the first
digit if population 9+, and OM -1 if population 5-. A
modified throw of less than 1 is 1, and a modified throw of
greater than 6 is 6. This throw indicates that the characters
have determined this type of trade good is the best item
available for their purposes. Throw once per week.
The quantity of goods available is then determined.
Th row the number of dice and multiply as shown (30x5
indicates the result of three dice multiplied by five). The lot
contains this quantity of goods, expressed in tons except in
the case of items 51 through 56, wh ich are expressed per
each item (the referee must determine the exact tonnage of
these items). Goods are available up to the quantity en·
countered. Partial purchases may be made if the characters
desire; partial purchases require a handling fee of 1%.
The price of goods is determined from the actual value
table; a two·dice throw determines the percentage of the
base price to be paid. This value multiplied by the quantity
of goods in the lot gives the net cost of the items. The
actual value table is subject to OMs from character skills,
broker's services, and trade classifications.
Broker's Services: Brokers m assist in the sale of
delivered to a world. Each must be paid his fee even if the
seller decides not to sell his goods. Brokers may provide
OMs from +1 to +4, at a cost of 5% of the sale per +1
provided (a +1 broker receives 5%; a +4 broker receives
20%) . The OM may never be higher than +4. Only one
broker may assist with a sale.
Character Skills: If characters are skilled in bribery or
admin, they may apply these as OMs for the sale of goods.
Only one character may influence a sale.
Trade Classifications: The trade and speculation table
indicates purchase and resale OMs based on trade classifi·
cations. There are six classifications of interest: agricultural
and non·agricultural, industrial and non-i ndustrial, rich and
poor worlds. A world may meet the criteria for more than
one label (and be poor, non-industrial, for example). In this
case, the world is subject to the OMs for each such label
when using the trade and speculation table.
TRADE GOODS
The trade and speculation table lists many types of
goods, often of general classes which may be of interest to
characters for various uses. The goods labels are abstractions,
such that a cargo of firearms could potentially be any
form from muzzleloading replicas to laser carbines. Should
characters wish to divert some part of the cargo to personal
use (through payment or pilferage). the exact type of cargo
must be determined by the referee.
When determ ining the contents of a cargo, the players
and referee must be certain to correlate the established
price of goods with the cost per ton. For example, the base
price of a shotgun is Cr150, while a ton of firearms as trade
goods has a base price of Cr30,000. A strict weight ex·
tension of the shotgun (3. 75 kg per shotgun) would indi·
cate 266 shotguns. Extension should be instead based on
price, with weight as a limiting factor. Thus one ton of
shotguns would contain 200 guns, at Cr150 each. The extra
weight can be considered packing and crates. Similar
calculations should be made to keep prices in line on other
trade goods.
Some goods (those results 51 · 56, and 66 on the table)
are sold in dividually instead of by the ton. Quantity is
expressed in single units; tonnage and base prices must be
determined by the players or referee in accordance with
established prices and equipment.

Drugs
A variety of pharmacological means are available to travellers for medicinal (and other) purposes. Each drug has its own
advantages and disadvantages; users should be aware of their effects. Six common types of drug are well-known: slow drug,
fast drug, combat drug, medical drug, anagathics, and truth drug. Psi drug is a seventh, less common type.
Dosages: The six drug types, for the sake of uniformity and for ease of use, are available in consistent, one-dose pill form.
Other drugs may be available in a variety of forms and dosages.
Synergy: If more than one drug is taken (except medical drug), the combination may have an adverse effect, called
synergy. In addition to all other effects of drugs, throw one die for each drug taken, and multiply the resu lts together.
The number indicates hits received as a result of synergy, and are inflicted at the end of the period of drug use.
Legality: The use or possession of certain drugs may be restricted by local law. Throw the law level or greater for a
specific drug to be legal and unrestricted on any specific world. OMs may be allowed for starship crews, medical personnel,
or other specifically authorized individuals.
SPECIFIC DRUG TYPES
The following six drug types are common throughout
the civilized universe.
Slow drug is named because it makes the universe (from
the user's viewpoint) appear to move more slowly. This
effect is achieved by accelerating the user's metabolism. In
effect, the user lives approximately twice as fast as normal.
Slow drug takes effect after three firing rounds (45
seconds), and continuing to function for 40 (real time)
firing rounds. At the end of its effect, the user receives 1 D
in wounds. The person is extremely fatigued, being treated
as if all available combat swings have been taken, and must
recover from that fatigue. A person under slow drug
(because he or she is living at twice the normal rate) is
allowed two combat rounds to each one available to normal
individuals. The person can fire a weapon twice, or make
two combat swings or blows, or move twice as far as
normally.
A medical slow drug is also available, being used to
hasten recovery from wounds or illness. One dose causes
unconsciousness, and the passage of thirty days equivalent
time in one day. During this period, ordinary healing takes
place. No wounds or hits are received from the use of
medical slow drug. Be certain to note the passage of time at
the increased rate during period of drug use. The individual
is unconscious or semi-conscious while under the influence
of medical slow drug.
Fast drug is named because it makes the universe (to its
user) appear to move much more quickly; the drug slows
down personal metabolism at a ratio of approximately 60
to 1. Users are extremely vulnerable because they are living
at such a slow rate; but physical aging is also slowed, and
the need for consumable supplies is reduced, thus allowing
conservation of air and food. Fast drug takes effect im·
mediately upon ingestion; one dose lasts for 60 days,
making that time appear to be only one day.
Combat drug is taken by fighters (usually military
personnel) prior to combat. It increases personal strength
and endurance each by two. The effect begins two combat
rounds after being taken, and lasts for 30 combat rounds.
When the effect wears off, the user receives 1 D in wounds.
Medical drug (often called panacea) is a general term
describing the set of drugs used by medical personnel in the
treatment of illness or injury. Generally, medical drug must
be administered by a person with medical expertise, and the
drug serves as medical treatment. Medical drug is often used
in conjunction with medical slow drug.
Anagathics are drugs which counteract the aging process.
A regimen of regular monthly doses enables an individual to
ignore the aging die throws and their potential for debilita·
tion. Because of the rarity and demand for anagathics, they
are quite expensive, and are often unavailable at any price.
Truth drug is used to compel individuals to answer
interrogation truthfully. One dose is sufficient to assure
truthful answers for approximately 2 minutes, after which
the user experiences one h'our of unconsciousness, and 20
in wounds.
ANTIDOTES
Antidotes are available for both slow and fast drugs
which cancel their major effects. The individual is returned
to the normal rate of living, but still suffers any indicated
recovery requirements.
DRUG AVAILABILITY
The drug table indicates the name, gross effect, base
price, technological level of the world on which it is
generally available in pill form, and a throw for availability.
Availability indicates the chance that, after determined
search, a band of adventurers will find an individual with
some of the drug available for sale. Subtract the technologi·
cal level shown on the table from that of the current world;
that number is a OM on the availability throw. For ex·
ample, slow drug is available at tech level 8, and the adven·
turers are on a tech level12 world. The OM is +4 (12-8=4).
On a tech level 4 world, the OM would be -4 (8-12=-4).
OMs may also be allowed for bribery, streetwise, or medical
skill.
Adventures: If any specific drug becomes important to
the player characters, then the referee may make drug
availability dependent upon the outcome of a scenario or
adventure.

Equipment
The infinity of physical objects in the universe and the variation in their potential costs and values defy classification; it
is impossible to note and define them all. The objects below are presented as indications of common qualities and values.
Each listing notes the object's name, followed by its technological level in parentheses, a price in credits, and a basic
description. The technological level indicates local technology required to manufacture something with the capabilities
listed. Price and weight are for an item manufactured by an interstellar society of tech level 10 to 15; items produced at
lower tech levels (including the one mentioned in the description) will probably be bulkier and more expensive. An item
with no weight or size given can be carried or worn without difficulty. Additional lines of explanation are given where
considered necessary.
This listing may be considered a shopping list for travellers. When they originally outfit themselves for an adventure, each
may purchase or acquire items from this list in preparation for action or mishap. For the most part, this list does not include
weaponry, and all items are generally available for purchase without difficulty on worlds with a sufficient technology level
(on other worlds, they may be available as imports at higher prices). Often, the base price for these items will be altered
higher or lower using the trade and speculation rules for percentage price changes.

information:
Basic Cuisine on a Daily Basis: Food is available in a
variety of forms and qualities. Prices reflect costs per
person. Restaurant meals of ordinary quality cost Cr10 per
day. Excellent quality meals range in price from Cr20 to
Cr50 per person. Travellers' Aid Society facilities provide
excellent quality meals to members and guests for Cr20.
Food purchased from vendors for preparation at home
costs about Cr5 per day, and weighs about 1 kg.
Preserved foods for rations on expeditions may be
canned or packaged (Cr20 per day, weighs 500 grams) or
dehydrated (Cr25 per day, weighs 200 grams, and is dependent
on locally supplied water).
Subsistence on a Long Term Basis: When time must pass
quickly, the referee can allow personal survival or subsistence
costs at the following values.
Starvation Level: bare minimum of food, Cr60 per
month; dismal lodging, Cr60 per month.
Subsistence Level: reasonable food, Cr120 per month;
acceptable lodging, Cr180 per month.
Ordinary Level: good food, Cr200 per month; good
lodging, Cr200 per month.
High Living: excellent food, Cr600 per month; excellent
accommodations, Cr300 per month.

Vehicles
Planetary transportation, whether on the world surface, on or under its oceans, in its atmosphere, or even in orbit,
is possible through a wide variety of available vehicles. These various forms of transportation will be required by adventurers
as they travel away from the starport of a world. The following are general guidelines for the use of vehicles.
Primitive Transportation: On worlds with low technology levels (0 through 3). the local means of transportation will
tend to depend on beasts of burden, animal-drawn carts, and watercraft such as galleys and sailing ships. Prices for such
items will depend on local situations: animals and wagons are priced in hundreds of credits; ships are priced in the thousands
and tens of thousands of credits.
local beasts of burden and riding animals will be domesticated herbivores similar to animals in local encounter tables and
generally of the 200 to 400 kilogram range or above. It is interesting to note that low passage berths had their origin in the
transport of animals, and can carry a 400 kg animal if characters wish to bring along their own riding beasts.
Modern Transportation: The transport vehicles available to a modern technological society include aircraft , grav vehicles,
tracked vehicles, wheeled vehicles, and watercraft. Aircraft are further divided into helicopters, propeller-driven aircraft, and
jet-propelled aircraft; watercraft are further divided into small watercraft, hovercraft, submersibles, and large watercraft. In
addition, interplanetary ships and interplanetary small craft are available.
Transport Skills: The categories of vehicles available parallel the available transport skills for characters. Individuals
usually must have skill in a specific vehicle type in order to properly operate that form of transportation. All vehicles within
a category can be operated by a person possessing the skill for that category. For example, all tracked vehicles can be
operated by an individual with tracked vehicle skill. If a category has divisions (for example, aircraft). then the character
may operate vehicles within a specific division with an appropriate skill (for example, jet aircraft), and other divisions within
the category (for example, propeller-driven aircraft and helicopter) at the skill level minus 1.
There is some latitude and interchangeability for some of the skills available. All characters are assumed to be able to
110 operate wheeled vehicles (in slow speed, non-dangerous situations) without any skill. Air/raft skill and grav vehicle skill are
interchangeable and identical. ATV skill allows an individual to operate both wheeled and tracked vehicles. Pilot skill, in
addition to allowing operation of starships and interplanetary ships, can be used to operate small craft (the equivalent of
ship's boat skill) at one less than full level.
AIRCRAFT
Aircraft generate lift by passing air over wing-surfaces,
either fixed (as in most aircraft) or rotating (as in helicopters).
Aircraft are usable only on worlds with atmospheres
of 4+. Although true winged craft appear only at tech level
5+, engineless gliders may be constructed as far back as tech
level 0, becoming fairly common at tech level 3.
Aircraft require frequent maintenance (between uses, or
daily) in order to insure reliability. The basic throw for a
malfunction is 11+, OM +1 for each missed maintenance.
The aircraft category has three divisions for the purpose
of skill utilization: helicopters, propeller-driven fixed wing
aircraft, and jet-propelled fixed wing aircraft. Any character
with skill in one division can operate aircraft in a companion
division at - 1. For example, helicopter-3 could
operate propeller and jet f ixed wing aircraft at leve l-2.
The following are some examples of aircraft.
Primitive Biplane Aircraft (5) Cr20,000, 1 ton. A very
small, propeller-driven, early model aircraft. It can achieve a
cruise speed of 150 kph, with bursts to a maximum of 200
kph; range is three hours flying time. The biplane's engine
depends on chemical fuel. The biplane carries two persons
(a pilot and a passenger) and 100 kg of cargo.
Fixed Wing Aircraft (6) Cr1 ,000,000, 5 tons. A twin jet
aircraft monoplane intended for cargo transport. The plane
cruises at 600 kph (maximum speed is 700 kph) with a
range of 3600 km or six hours. Fuel is standard chemical jet
fuel. The craft requires a crew of two (only one of whom
needs aircraft skill) and can carry six passengers, plus five
tons of cargo. Typical wingspan: 15 meters; typical length:

GCarrier
Wheeled ATV
15 meters. Other versions of this aircraft are possible,
including seaplanes, and faster, larger, or armed versions.
Helicopter (6) Cr100,000, 1 ton. Single engine rotary
wing aircraft capable of vertical take-off and landing as well
as maneuverability in tight places. The helicopter can
cru ise at 200 kph, with a top speed of 250 kph; range is
600 kph. The helicopter has a crew of one, plus seven
passengers and 500 kg of cargo.
GRAV VEHICLES
Grav vehicles are the main form of transportation for a
high technology society. Above tech level 10, other vehicle
types are rarely seen except in a few specialized situations.
All grav vehicles are essentially similar in handling charac·
teristics, differing only in performance.
Grav vehicle skill is necessary to operate a grav vehicle.
Air/raft skill is a synonym for grav vehicle skill.
Grav vehicles can operate in any environment and are
capable of reaching orbit from a world surface (although
most cannot do so very rapidly).
Air/Raft (8) Cr600,000, 4 tons. A light anti-gravity
vehicle which uses nullgrav modules to counteract gravity
for lift and propulsion. An air/raft can cruise at 100 kph
(but is extremely subject to wind effects), with some
capability of higher speed to about 120 kph. An air/raft can
reach orbit in several hours (number of hours equal to
planetary size digit in the UPP); passengers must wear vacc
suits and interplanetary travel in an air/raft is not possible.
Range in time or distance on a world is effectively un·
limited, requiring refueling from a ship's power plant every
ten weeks or so. An air/raft can carry four persons plus four
tons of cargo. The air/raft is unpressurized and usually
open-topped.
GCarrier (8) Cr1,000,000, 8 tons. An enclosed military
or quasi-military grav vehicle. The GCarrier is an armored
air/raft type vehicle intended originally for troop carrier
duties. Performance is similar to that of the air/raft, but the
Vehicles
Speeder
~re;,a::;:>
Air/ Raft
vehicle generally has a gun mount and an armored rear
hatch door. It requires a crew of one (with air/raft skill),
plus a gunner for the craft's weapon, if any. It can carry
14 persons (including the driver and gunner), plus 2 tons of
cargo (or assume 250 kg cargo for each person not carried;
thus driver, gunner, and 5 tons cargo).
Speeder (8) Cr1 ,000,000, 6 tons. A streamlined gravpowered
craft intended for high speed transport between
points on a world surface. Similar in principle to the
air/raft and the GCarrier, the speeder is streamlined and
concentrates on speed. It is capable of 1000 kph cruise
speed (maximum speed is 1200 kph), and has a virtually
unlimited range. Refueling is required every ten weeks from
a ship's power plant. The speeder carries a driver (who
operates the craft at air/ raft skill minus 1 ), a single passenger,
and 100 kg of cargo. The speeder is capable of reaching
orbit within an hour.
Grav Belt (12) Cr100,000, negligible weight if on; 10 kg
if turned off. Personal anti-gravity transportation using a
single null-gravity module and a personal harness. Performance
is similar in speed and range to the air/raft.
WHEELED VEHICLES
Wheeled ground vehicles depend on wheels to ease the
friction of travel overland. They depend on relatively
smooth and unobstructed terrain (roads, prairies, plains)
for optimum operation. Wheeled vehicles include cars,
trucks, most road vehicles, and wheeled all terrain vehicles.
Any character can operate a wheeled vehicle at slow
speeds and under non-dangerous conditions without
wheeled vehicle skill. Racing, long-distance, or long-period
operation calls for some wheeled vehicle skill.
When characters use wheeled ground vehicles, the referee
should note some specific throws which will govern their
use. Throw 12+ for mechanical difficulty or failure, allowing
OMs for personal expertise, terrain, and perhaps age and
condit ion of the vehicle. Throw 1 0+ for terrain difficulty if
111

112
Vehicles
not on roads or smooth terrain such as plains or prairies,
or include such items on animal encounter tables for the
current world surface. Note that local law level can be used
as the throw (law level +) to avoid such things as speed
traps or traffic violation arrests.
The following are examples of wheeled ground vehicles:
Ground Car (5) Cr4,000, 2 tons. An ordinary selfpowered
wheeled vehicle suitable for local use in civilized
areas or on roads. Typically, a ground car has a range of
1000 km, cruises at 100 kph, and has a maximum speed of
150 kph. If capable of off-road travel at all, speed is generally
limited to 10 kph. Fuel for a ground car depends on
local tech level and fuel sources; it is usually chemical fuel
(hydrocarbons or hydrogen) or electric batteries. Most
ground cars require a driver, although at higher tech levels
the car will steer itself (and on highly civilized worlds
driving under human control is illegal in cities) . A car can
carry five additional passengers plus luggage. Other models
(convertibles, sports models, limousines, trucks, motorcycles,
unicycles, vans, etc.) may be available at varying
prices. The basic ground car is unpressurized. Ground cars
are mass production items manufactured for a specific
world; they will tend to malfunction when transferred
to a world not similar to their world of origin.
Wheeled All Terrain Vehicle (6) Cr30,000, 10 tons. A
wheeled vehicle intended for transport across undeveloped
areas. A wheeled all terrain vehicle (abbreviated ATV) has a
range of 5000 km, cru ises on roads at 60 kph, and can
achieve a maximum speed of 100 kph. Off roads, speed
depends on terrain; on open plain, it will approach normal
road performance, while in difficult terrain, maximum
speed will be 20 kph or less. (Tracked ATVs are somewhat
slower than wheeled versions, but are also more reliable in
difficult terrain.) An ATV may be powered by a battery
recharged from a ship's power plant, or it may contain a
small fusion pack, requiring hydrogen or water for fuel. The
ATV is designed to serve admirably on many different
worlds under widely varying conditions, including vacuum
and insidious atmosplleres, and high or low gravity. An
ATV requ ires one driver. Passengers can number up to 16;
the vehicle is fully pressurized and contains complete
(though cramped) eating, sleeping, and travel facilities for
eight. The vehicle may be l ightly armored, and can carry a
turret mounting a laser or other local combat weapon.
Wheeled Armored Fighting Vehicle (6) Cr70,000, 10
tons. A wheeled vehicle reinforced with armor and mounted
with heavy weapons for combat. The armored f ighting
vehicle (abbreviated AFV) is very similar to the ATV in
performance, range, and fuel requirements. However, the
Game Designers' Workshop
AFV is armored to withstand most forms of attack, and is
equipped with a turret mounting a laser or other weapon. A
crew of three (one with ATV skill, one with gunnery skill,
and one with no skill required) is called for, with little or
no interior facilities provided. No provision for passengers
or cargo is made. A wheeled AFV is more commonly used
in urban areas where roads are available.
TRACKED VEHICLES
Tracked ground vehicles depend on continuous tracks
to ease the friction of travel overland. They are capable of
traversing almost any type of terrain, restricted only by
chasms, shear cliffs, and other insurmountable obstacles.
Tracked vehicles are generally slower than wheeled vehicles.
Tracked vehicles include all terrain vehicles, armored
fighting vehicles, and construction equipment.
Tracked vehicle skill is required for the use of any
tracked vehicle. When characters use tracked ground
veh icles, the referee should note some specific throws
which will govern their use. Throw 11+ for mechanical
difficulty or failure, allowing OMs for personal expertise,
terrain, and perhaps age and condition of the vehicle.
Throw 11+ for terrain difficulty or include such items on
animal encounter tables for the current world surface. Note
that local law level can be used as the throw (law level +) to
avoid such things as speed traps or traffic violation arrests.
The following are examples of tracked ground veh icles:
Tracked All Terrain Vehicle (6) Cr30,000, 10 tons. A
tracked vehicle intended for world surface exploration.
A tracked all terrain vehicle (abbreviated ATV) has a range
of 5000 km, cruises on roads at 40 kph, and can achieve a
maximum speed of 80 kph. Off roads, speed depends on
terrain ; on open plain, it will approach normal road performance,
while in difficult terrain, maximum speed will be
30 kph or less. (Wheeled ATVs are somewhat faster than
tracked versions, but are also less reliable in difficult
terrain.) An ATV may be powered by a battery recharged
from a ship's power plant, or it may contain a small fusion
pack, requiring hydrogen or water for fuel. The ATV is
designed to serve admirably on many different worlds
under widely varying conditions, including vacuum and
insidious atmospheres, and high or low gravity. An ATV
requires one driver. Passengers can number up to 16; the
veh icle is fully pressurized and contains complete (though
cramped) eating, sleeping, and travel facilities for eight. The
vehicle may be lightly armored, and can carry a turret
mounting a laser or other local combat weapon.

armed for combat. The tracked armored fighting vehicle
(abbreviated AFV) is very similar to the tracked ATV in
performance, range, and fuel requirements. However, the
AFV is armored to withstand most forms of attack, and is
equipped with a turret mounting a laser or other weapon. A
crew of three (one with ATV skill, one with gunnery skill,
and one with no skill required) is called for, with little or
no interior facilities provided. No provision for passengers
or cargo is made. Tracked AFVs are best suited to combat
in cross-country or unsettled situations.
Dirtmover (8) Cr40,000, 10 tons. A large, tracked piece
of construction equipment intended to shift ground cover
or construction materials for the building of bases, shelters,
or installations. The vehicle requires one operator, and can
operate (much like an ATV) for approximately 5,000 km.
Maximum speed for the vehicle is 30 kph; generally it
operates at much lower speeds. The dirtmover can shift
100 cubic meters of material per hour.
WATERCRAFT
Watercraft float on the oceans of worlds, and are useful
only in bodies of water typical on worlds with hydrographic
percentages of 1 +. In situations where hydrographic
percentages represent non-water oceans, watercraft specifically
designed for local conditions may be available.
The watercraft skill category has four divisions for the
purpose of skill utilization: small watercraft, hovercraft,
submersibles, and large watercraft. Any character with skill
in one of the divisions can operate watercraft in another
division at -1. For example, a character with small watercraft-
2 could operate submersibles, hovercraft, and large
watercraft at Ievei -l.
Small watercraft are operable by one person, often considered
a driver or operator. Typically, they do not exceed
100 tons. Large watercraft call for more than one person
to operate; they generally exceed 100 tons.
The following are some examples of watercraft. The
steamship and motor boat are small watercraft, while the
destroyer is a large watercraft.
Small Steamship (4) Cr60,000, 100 tons. Vessels of this
type vary widely; most are capable of 30 kph for sustained
periods. Fuel is some form of basic combustible. The ship
can carry a crew of five, ten passengers, and 50 tons of
cargo.
Vehicles
Motor Boat (5) Cr60,000, 60 tons. Advanced small craft
utilizing hydrofoils to allow high speed performance. The
motor boat can cruise at 60 kph, with bursts of speed to
100 kph. The ship's engines depend on local fuel sources,
such as hydrocarbons or electric batteries. A crew of three
operates the craft, which carries eight passengers and 10
tons of cargo.
Submersible (6) Cr2,000,000, 500 tons. Underwater
vessels intended to avoid surface weather conditions for
safety and convenience. On worlds with large water percentages
(especially level A) submersibles ply the routes
between underwater domed cities. The submersible is
capable of 40 kph cru ising underwater, and about half that
on the surface in good weather. It has unlimited endurance,
and depends on local energy sources for refueling or re charging.
It has a crew of five and provision for ten passengers
and 30 tons of cargo.
Destroyer (9) Cr2,000,000, 800 tons. Advanced large
watercraft intended for naval operations including escort
and patrol. The ship's engines depend on a fusion power
plant; deck-mounted turrets may fire heavy guns or missiles.
Operated by a crew of 10, the destroyer can cruise at 40
kph and may reach speeds of 60 kph for short periods.
Cargo capacity amounts to 40 tons, mostly used to carry
ammunition; provision for passengers and additional crew is
provided with 20 staterooms.
Hovercraft (7) Cr200;000, 8 tons. Ground effect vehicles
are supported on a cushion of air (at about 1 to 3 meters
altitude). Usable only on worlds with an atmosphere of 4 or
greater, hovercraft are capable of cruise speeds of 60 kph,
with bursts of speed to a maximum of 150 kph. Distance
between refuelings is 2000 km. Hovercraft may move over
both land and water with equal ease, but encounter difficulty
with broken ground, precipices, or storms. A crew
of one is sufficient to operate the vehicle; hovercraft can
carry up to 15 passengers plus operator. Cargo capacity is
approximately 3 tons. No armor or weaponry is generally
provided.
INTERPLANETARY VESSELS
Spacecraft capable of moving beyond orbit of a world
are described in the chapter on starships. That chapter also
includes instructions for the design and construction of
such craft.

THE PSIONIC INSTITUTE
Throw 11 + for a branch of the
Psionic Institute to exist on any
world with population 9+; OM +1 for
each level of population above 9.
Throw 9+ to locate the Institute
after one week of search; OM +1 per
level of streetwise and +1 per level of
admin skill. Character gives up search
after one week if not successful.
The Examination: For Cr5,000,
a two week examination can be
administered. Throw 1 0+ for a free
exam for the truly indigent.
Psionic Strength Ratings: Throw
20; OM -1 per four-year term of
service after age 18.
Maximum Activity Level: A
character may not perform any activity
unless his or her psionic strength
rating (unenhanced by drugs) is
equal to or greater than the required
level for that activity.
Available Strength Points: PSR
indicates the number of points avail·
able for performance of any activity.
Psi-drugs may increase these points.
Aging: Untrained characters have
their psionic strength rating reduced
by -1 every four years. Trained
characters are not subject to any
reductions in PSR.
Deterioration: No character may
have a PSR greater than the sum of
strength, dexterity, endurance, and
intelligence; if such a situation
occurs, then PSR is reduced to that
amount.

throw 20 for possible penalties. Throw 12+ for lobotomy, 1 0+ for lynching, 8+ for tarring and feathering, 6+ for imprison·
ment, and 4+ for deportation.

Psionics
The powers of the mind are incredible; and some day the study of these powers will enable every individual to use them
as an active part of his life. Psionics, however, can be frightening to those without the power, and the active or public use of
this power is not well received by the general populace, nor by the government. As a result, only a very few individuals ever
discover the psionic power that lies hidden in their minds.
The Psionic Institute: In the face of popular and official disapproval, the secrets of psionic science are held by a dedicated
group of talented individuals who operate the Psionic Institute. Accurate information about and quality training
in psionics are available only through branches of the Psionic Institute, which is wholly devoted to the study of mental
powers. Because of the prejudices which exist, the Institute maintains a low profile, and it is quite difficult to locate its
facilities. Any world with a population of 9 or greater may have a branch established on it (throw 11+ for a branch to exist;
OM +1 per level of population above 9).
Although a branch may exist, it still must be located. Any character may indicate that he is searching for the local branch
of the Institute (throw 9+ to find it or information as to its location; OM +1 per level of streetwise expertise and +1 per
level of admin expertise). Such a search takes one week. If the search is unsuccessful, the character becomes convinced that
no branch exists on this world, and gives up the search there.
If the local branch is located, a character may inform his comrades of his success. There is some chance (throw 7+ to
avoid) that the branch is some distance away and will require a long trip to reach it.
Branches of the Institute perform two functions: they administer the examination for psionic potential, and they provide
training in the use of psionic talents. Both services are provided for a fee.
PSIONIC STRENGTH
The Institute's comprehensive examination provides a
measure of personal psionic strength. The process takes two
weeks t ime, and costs CR 5000. Some charity is available
for truly indigent applicants (referee's discretion as to suit·
ability, then throw 10+ to be given a free examination).
The Examination: Each character has a basic potential
defined by a two-dice throw. Age constantly lessens this
potential, however, unless training is undertaken to use it.
A OM of - 1 is applied for each block of 4 years age above
18. These blocks correspond to the aging cycles. For
example, a character who takes the examination at age 23 is
in his second 4-year block, and has a OM of -2. Throw 2
dice and apply the OM. The result is the character's psionic
strength rating. The examination may only be taken once
per character.
Psionic Strength Ratings: The personal psionic strength
rating may range from zero to 11. Ratings of 12 or more
cannot be attained naturally once a character has passed
beyond age 18; they may be achieved temporarily through
the use of psi-drugs. The maximum possible rating is 15.
Psionic strength ratings indicate two things: the maxi·
mum level of activity which may be performed, and the
number of strength points at the character's command for
the performance of specific tasks.
Maximum Activity Level : Each type of activity within a
psionic field is assigned a level. A character may not perform
that activity unless his or her personal psionic strength
(unenhanced by psionic drugs) is equal to, or greater than,
the level of the activity.
Available Strength Points: Each type of activity requires
the expenditure of psionic strength points for the activity
and for the range at which the activity is performed. A
character's psionic strength rating is an index of the points
which he or she may expend. Expended points are regenerated,
over time, by rest and recuperation. Psi-drugs may
increase the points which are available to the character.
Aging and Deterioration: An untrained character is
subject to a gradual, relentless deterioration of his psionic
strength rating. When the aging point occurs (every 4
years), his or her rating is reduced by 1. A trained individ·
ual is not subject to reductions in power through normal
aging.
If, through aging, permanent injury, or any other cause,
a character (trained or untrained) has the sum of his first
four characteristics (strength, dexterity, constitution, and
intelligence) reduced to less than his psionic strength rating,
his psionic strength is reduced to that sum. Psi-drug abuse
can also reduce psionic strength.
TRAINING
The Institute will train individuals in the use of their
latent talents. Training requires 4 months and costs
Cr100,000. Extremely talented individuals (psionic strength
ratings of 9 or greater) may apply for a scholarship if they
cannot otherwise afford training. In such cases, the Institute
will take 95% of the character's assets, and waive
the remainder of the cost. (Referee: the Institute can, of
course, read minds, and will not favorably regard fraudulent
or devious applications.)
The Six Possible Talents: Although there are a total of
six possible areas of psionic activity, no one person will
usually be capable of activity in all areas. In training, a
character will learn those areas in which he has ability or
potential, and those areas in which he has no talent at all.
Roll two dice successively for each of the six talents
listed in the talent table. A throw is indicated which must
be achieved in order to have ability in that area. A OM must

The Traveller Book
be applied to each throw: the throws may be made in any
order, but there is a OM of - 1 on the first throw, -2 on the
second throw, -3 on the third throw, and so on. A
character who is extremely anxious to acquire teleportation
should throw for that talimt first.
Effects of Training: The training sessions merely ac·
quaint the character with the possibilities of psionic talents,
and impart a rudimentary control over them. As a result,
the character can perform any task of level 1. Experience
and hard work will allow the character to learn how to use
greater levels of power. The effects of time and experience
are given in the descriptions of the specific talents.
Training also instructs the characters in the methods of
concealing their powers, and in the dangers of allowing
common citizens to know of their power. When training is
completed, the Institute is incapable of further assisting
characters in their psionic development. From that point,
all depends on experience and fortune.
It is possible for a character to have a very high psionic
strength rating and nonetheless turn out very badly in
training, discovering that he has few or no specific abilities.
It is also possible to discover that a character has a rudi·
mentary talent in a field, but insufficient level to enable
him to perform any activity. For example, teleportation
requires a psionic strength rating of 7. A character with a
psionic strength of 5 who achieves teleportation as a talent
is still unable to teleport because he has an insufficient
rating. Ps i·drugs will increase his strength, but not his
rating.
Psionic training is not available in the services, nor is it
available from any source except the Institute.
RANGE
Psionic activity is restricted by the range or distance at
which it is performed. A greater number of psionic strength
points are required to do psionic tasks at greater ranges.
The range definitions given here apply to psionic activ·
ity. It is important to note that the ranges close to very
long are identical to the tactical ranges used in personal
combat. Psionics have so far proven incapable of interplanetary
ranges.
Range refers to simple straight line distance. Psionic
activity, at the ranges given, is effectively instantaneous,
and is not affected by intervening matter in most cases
(for example, electromechanical psionic shields do interfere
with psionics, but planetary masses or walls do not).
TELEPATHY
Telepathy is the ability to contact other minds directly.
In rudimentary forms, it allows the communication of
feelings and emotions; in advanced forms it allows the
transfer of information. There are several levels of telepathy,
which depend on the psionic strength and exper·
ience of the user.
Life Detection: The most elementary form of telepathy
is the ability to detect the presence of other minds. Life
detection enables a character to sense the presence of other
minds, the number of minds present, the general type of
minds (animal, human, etc.) and their approximate location.
Life detection is a level 1 ability, and requires 1
Psionics
psionic strength point to perform (plus any additional cost
due to range, if applicable). Activity may last up to 60
seconds. Life detection is reasonably sophisticated, and can
"ignore" bacteria or unimportant animals in the area. It
functions best in detecting intelligent minds. Shielded
minds are undetectable (see Shields). If an individual whom
the telepath knows is "life detected", he or she will be
recognized.
Telempathy: The communication of emotions and basic
feelings is accomplished by telempathy. This ability serves
well in the handling of animals and beasts of burden, but
may also be applied as a psychological weapon against
humans. Sending of emotions such as love, hate, fear, and
so on may influence other beings (although not necessarily
in the manner desired) . Telempathy also allows the emotions
and feelings of others to be read by a character.
Telempathy is a level 2 ability, and requires 1 psionic
strength point to perform (plus range costs as applicable).
Activity may last up to 60 seconds.
Read Surface Thoughts: The most commonly known
feature of telepathy is the ability to read the thoughts of
other individuals. Only active, current thoughts are read by
this ability, with the subject (if himself not a telepath)
unaware of the activity. Individuals with telepathic ability
cannot be read due to the presence of their natural shields.
This ability is of level 4 and requires 2 psionic strength
points to perform. Activity may take up to 60 seconds.
Range costs must be added if applicable.
Send Thoughts: Complementary to the ability to read
surface thoughts is the ability to send thoughts to others.
Such individuals need not themselves be telepathic to
receive such thoughts. Telepathic individuals are normally
open to such t ransmissions, but may close their shields
against transmissions if they become bothersome or threat·
ening. A thought transmission may last up to 120 seconds.
Sending thoughts is a level 5 ability, and requires 2 psionic
strength points to perform, plus normal costs due to range.
Probe: The application of great psionic strength will
enable a telepath to delve deep into the mind of a subject
117

and to then read his innermost thoughts. Questioning can
be used in the procedure to force the subject to divulge
specific information. The prober can easily determine
deliberate untruths told (thought) by the subject. Probe
cannot be used against a shielded mind. Probe is a level 9
ability, and requires 8 strength points to perform. Probing
may last up to 10 minutes, which time is usually sufficient
to determine the information sought.
Assault: Violence may be dealt by a telepath. Against an
unshielded mind, the result is automatic unconsciousness,
and possible death. Against a shielded mind, an instant duel
ensues. An unshielded mind, when assaulted telepathically,
is rendered unconscious immediately, and the character
receives wounds equal to 20+6. When a shielded mind is
assaulted, the attacking telepath compares his psionic
strength rating to the psionic strength rating of the defen·
der: the difference (attacker minus defender) is the re·
quired DM. For the assault to succeed, the attacker must
throw 7+. For example, an attacker with a psionic strength
rating of 13 assaults a character with a psionic strength
rating of 5 ( 13-5=8); a DM of +8 is allowed in the assault.
Assault is a level 10 ability, and requires 10 strength
points to perform. The assault takes less than 2 seconds to
occur.
Shield: All telepathically able characters learn how to
create a mental shield which protects the mind against
unwanted telepathic interference. Such a shield is auto·
matically in force at all times and requires no strength point
expenditure to maintain. Artificial psionic shields are
clumsy helmet-like devices which function in much the
same manner while worn. They weigh 1000 grams, offer
little physical protection, and have a base price of CR 4000.
Experience: When the talent of telepathy is initially
learned, a telepath is capable only of life detection and
shield. As time passes, and the character works at improving
his ability (time passing is sufficient for this), he will
gradually improve to the full range of his potential. Each
month, the character may roll two dice to determine his
progress in his telepathic talent. On a throw of 8+, he has in·
creased his capability one level. Such an increase may never
Game Designers' Workshop
result in an ability hi!tJer than his psionic strength rating.
For example, a character with a psionic strength rating of
11 is potentially capable of all abil ities, including assault,
but upon completion of training, he is actually capable only
of level 1 activity (life detection and shield). After success·
fully rolling 8+ 10 times (in 10 or more months, at one roll
per month). he will have realized his full potential. A
character of psionic strength rating 4 could never exceed
level 4 (after 4 or more months, at one roll per month) .
In situations where a non-player character is read or
influenced by telepathy, it is the responsibility of the
referee to determine the person's reactions and thoughts.
CLAIRVOYANCE
Clairvoyance is the general talent which allows a person
to sense events at some location displaced from the viewer.
There are several levels of clairvoyant ability.
Sense: The basic ability to sense things at some point in
the distance. A character will become aware of the most
rudimentary characteristics of a location when applying this
ability. For example, the referee will give a basic descrip·
tion, without detail: "a room, containing 4 dogs" or "an
open plain with a tree, and no animals or men present".
The clairvoyant character must state the range at which he
is applying his talent, and will generally sense the most
interesting or important feature at that range. Sense is a
level 2 ability, and requires 1 psionic strength point to
perform (plus any range cost).
Clairvoyance: This specific abil ity allows actual viewing
of a situation at some displaced point. It may be performed
outright, or to allow elaboration of some situation sensed.
The clairvoyant character must state the range at which he
is applying his talent. Clairvoyance is a level 5 ability, and
requires 2 psionic strength points to perform, in addition to
any range costs.
Clairaudience: This ability is identical to clairvoyance,
with the exception that it allows hearing instead of seeing.
Combined Clairvoyance and Clairaudience: A character
is capable of both seeing and hearing a specific situation by
using this ability. It is of level 9, and requires 2 psionic
strength points to perform, in addition to any range costs.
Direction: A character may specify the exact location at
which he is applying his ability, if it is out of physical sight,
by direction, provided he has some knowledge of the
location by experience or description. This guidance assists
him in performing his activity in the most efficient manner.
Direction is a level 3 ability, and requires no basic points to
perform (although range costs must be paid).
Clairvoyance abilities allow eavesdropping activities as
well as spying and detection-free exploration of situations.
While telepathic life detection will determine the presence
of living minds in a closed room, for example, sense will
determine if a room is occupied or empty. Clairvoyant
activity cannot be sensed by others, including by other
psionic talented individuals.
Experience: A beginning (newly trained) clairvoyant is
considered to be of level 1 regardless of his actual psionic
strength rating. Each month, he must throw two dice, and
if he achieves 8+, he increases his actual ability one level,
until he has reached his actual psionic strength level.

The Traveller Book
TELEKINESIS
Telekinesis is the talent which allows objects to be
manipulated without physically touching them. Telekinetic
power is classified by the number of grams weight which
the person can manipulate. Any manipulation is treated as
if the person were physically handling the item, but physi·
cal danger, pain, or other stimuli are not present. Telekinesis
includes a limited amount of sensory awareness, sufficient
to allow actual intelligent manipulation.
The telekinetic levels table indicates the weight manipu·
lation allowed by level of ability. In addition, the level of
ability indicates the cost in psionic strength points to
perform such manipulation. Costs due to range must also be
paid. The costs envision normal lifting or manipulating;
throwing with a strength generally equivalent to physical
throwing may be performed at a double psionic strength
point cost. Any one telekinetic feat may last for up to 60
seconds. Note that personal weight in most cases will not
exceed 100 kilograms; a character of level 10 telekinetic
ability can levitate. Gravity differences will not alter the
mass which can be manipulated.
Telekinetic power may not be applied at greater than
very long range, and then only (as may be seen from the
range table), at relatively great cost in psionic strength
points.
Experience: Regardless of ultimate potential ability, a
character leaves training capable only of level 1 activity.
Each month, upon successful achievement of a roll of 8+,
ability level increases one level. A character's level of ability
may never exceed his psionic strength rating.
AWARENESS
Awareness is the psionic talent which allows control of
one's own body. Awareness covers a range of four possible
abilities, described below.
Suspended Animation: Pe rsonal body activity may be
suspended for varying periods of t ime. A character with
awareness may enter a suspended animation state (similar
to cold sleep, but without the intrinsic danger of death) by
will ing himself into it. Such a state continues for 7 days,
without need for food or water, and with minimal air
needs. Such a person could effectively travel in a cold sleep
berth, without actually undergoing cold sleep and its
dangers. Suspended animation may be stopped at any time,
provided external stimulus is given to awaken the sleeper
(such as a friend or a mechanical alarm). This is a level 2
ability, and costs 3 points to perform.
Psionically Enhanced Strength: Psionic strength points
may be converted to physical strength points on a tem·
porary basis. The character makes the commitment, reduces
his available psionic strength by a specific number of
points, and increases his physical strength characteristic by
that number. In no case may the number of strength points
gained exceed the character's current level of awareness,
and physical strength may not be increas!?d beyond 15.
Psionically enhanced strength reaches its new level imme·
diately, remains at that peak for 60 minutes, and then
declines at the rate of 1 strength point per minute until
normal strength level is reached. Psionically enhanced
strength is a level 4 ability.
Psionics
Psionically Enhanced Endurance: Psionic strength points
may be converted to physical endurance points on a tem·
porary basis. The character makes the commitment, reduces
his available psionic strength points, and increases his
endurance characteristic by the same number. In no case
may the number of endurance points gained exceed the
character's current level of ability, nor may endurance ever
be increased to beyond 15. Psionically enhanced endurance
reaches its new level immediately, remains at that level for
60 minutes, and then declines at a rate of one point per
minute until normal endurance level is reached. Ps ionically
enhanced endurance is a level 5 ability.
Regeneration: Wounds and injuries may be healed
rapidly. Wound points may be healed by the application of
this ability, exchanging one psionic strength point to
regenerate one wound point. Heal ing occurs immediately
(less than one minute). Should one session of healing be
insufficient, further healing and regeneration may be
applied after expended psionic strength is recovered.
Regeneration may also be applied to the growing of new
limbs or organs to replace lost ones, or to heal unrecovered
old wounds suffered prior to psionic training. Regeneration
may not be used to counteract aging. Regeneration is a level
9 ability. ·
Awareness is not capable of affecting others and may
not be used for healing or enhancing other characters.
Experience: A character with awareness leaves training
with level 1 ability, and may increase the ability as time
passes. Each month throw 20 for 10+; if successful, in·
crease the level of awareness by 1.
TELEPORT AT ION
Teleportation is a talent which allows effectively instan·
taneous movement from one point to another point,
without regard to intervening matter. Psionic teleportation
is limited to the movement of the teleported character's
body and (for highly skilled teleports) his or her clothing
and weapons.
Teleportation calls for the range cost as indicated on the
119

120
Psionics
table to be paid in order to perform the activity, regardless
of the level of the skill or its apparent difficulty.
Personal teleportation without external materials such as
clothing or weapons is a level 5 skill.
Personal teleportation, clothed but without any personal
load or weapons, is a level 7 skill. A weapon of up to 1000
grams, if worn so as to be part of an individual's clothing
(holstered or sheathed). may be carried.
Personal teleportation, clothed and carrying a physical
load of weapons and other items, not to exceed the character's
strength in kilograms, is a level 9 ability.
Teleportation always involves the movement of one's
body to another location. Independent items or other
individuals may not be moved. A small animal could
conceivably be carried as part of a personal load under the
terms of level 9 ability.
Teleportation involves certain requirements in order to
be accurate, and to insure obedience of the laws of physics.
Preknowledge of Destination: A character must always
have a mental image of his or her destination before telaporting.
This mental image is acquired by personally visiting
the location first (including just viewing it from a distance),
having the mental image implanted in one's mind (by
telepathy) by another person who has visited the destination,
or by viewing the location through clairvoyance
(level 5 clairvoyance, not simply the lesser sense).
Energy and Momentum: Teleportation involves serious
restrictions on movement in order to assure the conservation
of energy and momentum.
On planetary surfaces, teleportation is restricted to
jumps of less than regional distance. Jumps at very distant
range involve disorientation for a period of 20 to 120
seconds. Jumps at distant range involve a chance (throw 8+)
that the character will stumble or fall upon arrival. The
character should demonstrate to the referee the specific
effects to be expected, and then how they will be avoided,
before attempting jumps at ranges greater than distant.
This restriction results from the law of conservation of
momentum: on a rotating planet, two locations will have
different rotational speeds and directions. A jump from a
Game Designers' Workshop
point on the earth's equator to its antipode would result in
a total velocity difference between the character and his
surroundings of over 3300 kph.
Changes in altitude (actually all movement to locations
of differing gravitational potential) will result in potential
energy changes, manifesting themselves as changes in body
temperature. A jump of 1 km straight down will result in a
temperature increase of 2.5 degrees Celsius; this is sufficient
to cause extreme fever, brain damage, and even death. A
jump up will cool the body by the same amount, with
equally serious results. To be safe, a jump may not involve
an elevation change of more than 400 meters, and multiple
jumps should not involve a cumulative elevation change of
more than 600 meters in one hour. These problems may be
gotten around through the use of technological devices:
energy compensators, heat suits, and other means. Characters
may feel driven to invent such materials, commission
their invention, or seek them out from those who already
have them.
Experience: Teleports leave training with level 5 ability;
those with a psionic strength rating of less than 5 may not
increase their abilities, and cannot teleport. Each month,
throw 12+ to increase by one level. Teleport level may not
exceed psionic strength rating.
SPECIAL
Although psionic activity generally lends itself to classification,
some individuals defy this very classification.
Individuals with special talent are capable of some activity
which is not described here; this talent is dispensed by the
referee after deliberation. The special talent may include
abilities not covered by this section, or may be a random
assignment of otherwise unreceived abilities. Special talents
should be made psychologically dependent on a focus, in
the form of some artifact or charm, which must remain in
the possession of the character.
RECOVERY
When psionic strength points are expended, the available
points for a character are reduced. Such points are naturally
recovered by a process of rest and recuperation. Beginning
three hours after the last psionic activity, a character
regains one psionic strength point per hour until the total
equals the normal psionic strength rating. Such recovery is
independent of physical activity. Psionic activity is defined
as any psionic-related act, including the taking of psi-drugs
for any purpose.
PSI -DRUGS
Chemical means are available to enhance psionic strength
points on a temporary basis. These drugs are:
Booster: The basic psi-drug, available in small one-dose
pills. Booster increases an individual's available psionic
strength points by +3 if taken when psionic strength is
at full power, or by +2 if psionic strength is at a reduced
level. Additional doses of booster have no effect if taken
within an hour, and the drug will never boost psionic
strength points to a level greater than normal +3. The
drug-induced additional psionic strength will wane and
disappear at the end of one hour.

The Traveller Book
Double: A more potent form of the drug, also available
in small, one-dose pills. Otherwise identical to booster,
double increases psionic power by +6 if taken when psionic
strength is at full power, or by +4 if taken when psionic
strength is at a reduced level.
Special: The rarest of psi-drugs, special is available only
in liquid form and must be taken by injection. Special
gradually increases psionic strength points to 15 at the rate
of one point per hour. Psionic strength remains at this level
(if unused) for four hours and then wanes at the rate of one
point per hour until psionic strength reaches zero. Normal
recovery then occurs. Special has some dangers, and there is
a chance (throw 11+ each time used) that it will permanent·
ly reduce psionic strength rating by -1 .
Availability: Because the general public attitude towards
psionics is negative, psi-drugs are expensive and difficult to
obtain. Psi-drugs must nearly always be located and bargained
for; they are not found in normal trade channels.
Dealers may exist on any world (throw 8+ to locate a
dealer after two days' search; OM of +1 per level of street·
wise expertise). Most dealers will have only booster; throw
1 D for the number of doses available with a base price of
Cr1 ,000. Double will be available on a throw of 10+; throw
10- 2 for the number of doses available with a base price of
Cr4,000. Special will be available on a throw of 12+; throw
1 D-4 for the number of doses available with a base price of
Cr10,000. Prices may be higher but will generally not be
lower.
Pitfalls: The abuse of psi-drugs can lead to the loss of
psionic powers and to physical debilitation. If a character
takes three doses in three days, there is a chance (throw 9+)
that drug overdose will take place within six hours of the
last dose.
If overdose occurs, the character becomes seriously ill,
lapsing into unconsciousness and taking hits equal to 30.
Upon recovery from the illness, psionic strength rating is
reduced (saving throw 1 0+) permanently by -1 .
PSIONICS IN HUMAN SOCIETY
The climate of public opinion about psionics is extreme·
ly negative. Individuals will find it unhealthy to admit
possession of, or sympathy for, psionic powers. Persons
with psionic ability will not admit their powers unless
reassured that they are in no danger; this will usually
involve self-revelation by a psionic talent.
Some hirelings or citizens may have psionic training or
Psionia
ability (throw 12 to have any ability; then determine the
actual ability) . There is an equal chance that the noncharacter
will be an informant or potential informant.
Psionic individuals detected by the public or the authorities
are subject to a variety of responses, based on a two
dice throw: 12+ for lobotomy, 10+ for lynching, 8+ for
tarring and feathering, 6+ for imprisonment, and 4+ for
deportation.
To The Referee: If everyone in society had psionics,
there would be an everpresent chance of player characters
having their minds read, of non-player characters knowing
what player characters thought or intended, and of such
conveniences as walls, locks, and doors having little practi·
cal use. A little thought will show that society would
be vastly different if everyone could use the psionic abilities
described here however they wished.
It is important to keep psionics under control and
out of the hands of most people. It is certainly permissible
for players to seek out the Psionics Institute and to try to
learn of their own psionic potential. But society as a whole
will not allow individuals to openly advertise that they have
psionic powers, nor will it allow individuals to use them
publicly. These points, if kept in mind, can help to main·
tain the fabric of the society in which the players are
enmeshed.

Basic Traveller Activities
The rules of Traveller provide a comprehensive outline for the basic activities confronting any character in the universe.
They are necessarily brief and admittedly omit many possible activities. After all, this one volume cannot even attempt
to provide rules governing the entire universe; entire libraries are not especially successful in that regard. In the hands of
players and a referee, however, the Traveller rules are the start of dynamic adventures that can range across the universe.
The first question that arises once the rules have been read is - What do I do now? This chapter contains the answers.
FIRST ACTIVITIES
In Traveller, many of the subordinate game systems lend
themselves to solitaire or two-person play. Practice with the
systems makes the player more proficient, more know·
ledgeable, and more experienced with the rules that govern
adventures. Take the time to run through the various
aspects of Traveller shown below.
Generate Characten: Use the chapter on characters to
generate characters from the six services, complete with
individual characteristics and personal skills. The challenge
to create an excellent character, and then muster-out
before failing a survival or aging throw makes this an
interesting and intriguing activity, especially solitaire.
Keep records of the characters generated for use later in
adventures, as non-player characters and as random person
encounters.
Practice Combat: Read through the chapter on personal
combat in order to acquaint yourself with the Traveller
personal combat system. Then pit one pregenerated charac·
ter against another in a sample battle. Solitaire, or with
friends, this procedure can give valuable insights into how
combat will work in action, and should show which weap·
ons are useful in what ways. Familiarity with the system
can show a player when to stand and fight, and when to run
away to fight later.
Examine Experience: Read the chapter on experience
and determine what techniques would best help any specific
character once he or she begins an adventuring career.
Choices between basic skills, weapons skills, and physical
characteristic improvements can determine how effective a
character will be.
STARSHIP ACTIVITIES
Using starships can be a fascinating activity, and lead to
hours of enjoyment.
Build Some Starships: The chapter on starship design
and construction describes a complete system for the
construction of interstellar capable starships, complete with
costs, tonnage restraints, and other considerations. Determine
what type of starship is wanted, and then set about
designing it. Attention must be paid to fitting all the neces·
sary components into the hull size chosen. The chapter on
starship economics should be consulted to determine what
sort of profit the ship can show. Maybe a redesign is in
order ...
Practice Space Combat: The chapter on space combat
provides a system for resolution of battles between starships.
Assign a few starships to each of several players, and
fight out a space battle, perhaps to the death. The experience
will show what to expect in space combat during
Traveller adventures.
ADVENTURE ACTIVITIES
Travelling through the universe in search of adventure
requires that there be a reasonably well-defined universe
for the characters to move around in.
Generate a Typical Subsector: Worlds are grouped into
subsectors. as explained in the chapter on worlds. Following
the simple system given, generate a subsector of perhaps
thirty worlds, and record the results for later adventures.
Before putting away this list, use it to strain your imagina·
tion : examine the various characteristics for each world,
and try to imagine the circumstances which make it the
way it is described.
Produce a Single World: Select one world from those in
the subsector generated and produce it in greater detail,
fleshing it out with maps and animal encounter tables.
Try Trade and Commerce: Assume that a free trader is
available and start out in the subsector buying goods for
later resale. Take on passengers (high, middle, and low) and
cargo, and use free cargo space to carry goods for speculation.
Keep track of profits and losses, and don't forget to
pay the appropriate ship costs. Continue until the ship goes
bankrupt, until someone makes a fortune, or until the ship
is paid off.
Check Out Psionics: After generating a character. read
the chapter on psionics. Assume that the character has
found a Psionic Institute, and has applied for testing and
training. Play around with the various psionic abilities
described.
Think Up Some Situations: Using whatever inspiration is
available (including novels, movies, and interesting events),
think up a situation and express it in terms of what
Traveller characters will encounter and what they must do
to deal with it. The sample adventures later in this book
may prove helpful in showing the necessary details for
such situations.
PLAY TRAVELLER
Any time you have a group of people together, take
them through any of the steps above to give them ex·
perience in the Traveller system. Or referee them as a group
in one of the sample adventures in this book. But most of
all, have fun!

Referee's Guide to Adventuring
Traveller players are in search of adventure. Some adventure comes from playing the game system, from designing star·
ships, and from exploring worlds generated by the referee. More adventure comes from the scenarios that the referee
supervises, and from participating in campaigns. The interaction of the characters involved, the imaginations of all the
players, and the details of the game system make the entire game fun for hours on end.
AN ADVENTURE GUIDE
Traveller adventures span the entire range of experience
that can be expected in the universe of the far future. The
potential for adventure is endless, depending as it does on
the situation and on the characters themselves. Nevertheless,
each adventure can be classified in a number
of different ways. These classification schemes can help any
referee to produce his or her own adventures.
Adventures can be classified by their settings, patrons,
situations, and catalysts. Each classification is independent,
and an adventure can contain one of each.
Settings are places or locations for adventures. Four
basic settings for adventures are the ship, the location,
the world, and the choreographed novel. The ship covers
any vessel, whether marine, interplanetary or interstellar,
or other type; ships provide interesting movable settings
with abundances of machinery and other equipment. The
location indicates any building or natural feature and is
usually indoors; it is often presented as a maze or labyrinth
to be conquered. The world indicates a setting which is
geographic in nature; it may be an entire world, or it may
be a mapped area or a smaller portion of a world. The
choreographed novel involves a setting already thought out
by the referee and presented to the players; it may be any
of the above settings, but contains predetermined elements.
As such, the referee has aready developed characters and
settings which bear on the group's activities, and they are
guided gently to the proper locations. Properly done, the
players never know that the referee has manipulated them
to a fore-ordained goal.
Patrons are non-player characters who provide direction
and guidance to the players. In many cases, they speak with
the voice of the referee in providing their help. Typical
patron missions include steal an object, protect an object,
find an object, or kill someone. At times, the players
themselves will develop their own missions and become for
a time, their own patrons. Rumors are especially helpful in
this regard.
Type indicates the actual nature of the adventure. An
adventure need not be purely of one type, often mixing
several types together for more excitement. Types of
adventures include the chase/ pursuit, the assault/rescue,
discovery/exploration, enrichment, the enigma/mystery,
and novelty.
The chase/pursuit may involve characters on either side
of the situation, and it is possible for events to turn the
tables on the players, converting the pursuers to the pursued
on a moments notice.
Assault/ rescue usually involves force or violence in
overwhelming enemy characters or the forces of nature in
order to obtain some goal. Characters may be on either side
of the assault/rescue.
Discovery/exploration puts the characters into an
unknown situation where they must find information about
their environment, either to ensure their own survival , or as
part of some interest they have.
Enrichment makes economic, social, intellectual, or
other improvement the primary goal. Such adventures are
mercenary (although not necessarily military) in nature.
The enigma/mystery presents a situation for the characters
to solve. It may be a simple murder mystery, with clues
all around, or it may be a puzzling alien structure about
wh ich the group is curious.
Novelty adventures place the characters in interesting
situations and allow them to deal with them. A visit to an
interstellar casino for a round of gambl ing could be a
novelty to some characters.
Catalysts serve to spark an adventure by providing
interest and direction. They include danger (which forces
action through threats). opportunity (which forces action
through a prom ise of reward). and puzzles (which prompt
action through curiosity).
By assembling these aspects of adventures together, the
referee can produce interesting and ever-changing adventures
for the players.

Referee's Guide to Adventuring
TRAVELLER ADVENTURES
Traveller scenarios come in many sizes and types. In
ascending order by size, they are called patron encounters,
casual encounters, amber zones, short adventures, adventures,
and campaigns. Size also has a direct bearing on the
completeness of detail presented and on the complexity of
the situation. Each type of scenario has its own special
appeal.
Patron Encounten: The smallest and easiest encounter is
with a patron. As dictated by the chapter on encounters, it
is possible to encounter a patron after a short search. The
patron will provide a purpose when hiring the adventurers,
and may provide limited funds for the task.
One method of administering a patron encounter is to
write a short paragraph for the players to read which
briefly details the information which is available to them.
Such information includes the location, a description of the
patron, the task to be assigned, and the remuneration which
will be paid. In addition, several details should be included
to establish some opinions in the minds of the characters.
To further complicate the situation, a selection of perhaps
six possible rationales or outcomes to the situation can be
made up (for example: the patron is lying, the patron is
crazy, the patron is honest, the patron has been swindled,
the patron is deviously trying to achieve something he
hasn't mentioned, or the patron is dishonest). and the true
outcome picked by the referee from the list, influencing the
referee's description of the encounter and the ensuing job.
Rumors encountered in the course of adventures may
add to what the players know about their patron and the
situation. In some cases, a rumor may be treated as an
absent patron, leading the characters off on a search of
their own.
Casual Encounters: Somewhat more detailed than the
patron encounter is the casual encounter. A patron appears,
but is more fully detailed and described. This description
often helps the adventurers determine attitudes or opinions
of the patron, helping guide the travellers' decisions. The
referee will already have established a single purpose,
mission, or task for the patron, and will present it to the
players. They must decide whether to accept the assignment,
and then set about planning a course of action.
Game Designers' Workshop
Because the causal encounter patron is more clearly defined,
the referee may be called upon to role-play the
patron (taking care not to take over the action, or to
provide too much guidance). Casual encounters are usually
more detailed than are patron encounters.
Amber Zones: Amber zone is a travel zone code promulgated
by the Travellers' Aid Society to warn off individuals
from dangerous worlds. This same name has been assumed
for situations which present a danger to characters and to
warn them to use caution. An amber zone situation need
not take place on an amber zone world. These situations
present a problem, task, or predicament to the players and
usually include a general outline for the referee to follow.
The referee must provide deck plans or maps where called
for, and he or she must be prepared to deal with problems
in background or reactions when it becomes necessary.
Short Adventures: Complete situations presented to the
players for their response are often short adventures.
Such short adventures include relatively complete maps
or deck plans, plus descriptions, detailed situations, animal
encounter tables, or other necessary information, and an
overview to explain the situation to the referee. Short
adventures are restricted only in their length, and often are
confined to a single building, starport, or incident which
must be dealt with by the players.
Short adventures focus mainly on a single interesting
situation and provide relatively detailed background and
data on that specific item.
Adventures: Large, detailed scenarios which deal completely
with a single topic are called adventures. Although
similar in nature to a short adventure, the larger adventure
provides pre-generated non-player characters, crews for
ships, details of starships to be encountered, background or
library data, and other materials to fl esh out the local
portion of the universe. All of this embellishment is in
addition to the basic situation which is to be dealt with. It
serves to make the environment more realistic, more
challenging, and more informative. In the course of dealing
with the basic idea of the adventure, the players also deal
with the background that makes the universe in this situation
seem more real.
Adventures are also long enough and complex enough
that the players will encounter several situations, often only
different aspects of the same basic premise, while they play.
Campaigns: The campaign is a combination of all of the
above types of situations into one continuous, intermeshing
role-playing fife. The background for a campaign remains
constant and consistent, while individual adventures, short
adventures, amber zones, casual encounters, and patron
encounters unfold within it. The fact that the campaign
maintains a constant background means that players who
learn some fact about the universe in one adventure can
often depend on that fact and use it later in another adventure.
Campaigns are almost always dependent on continuing
characters. Once a character is generated, he or she continues
(at least until death or retirement) to adventure
within the same framework of history and background,
gradually building up a knowledge of the universe that
should help in dealing with adversaries or nature.

The Traveller Book
TRAVELLER CAMPAIGNS
Traveller campaigns can be a simple string of adventures
and encounters set against the background of a pre·
generated subsector in which the adventurers fly from
world to world, engaging in trade and speculation, seeking
and finding patrons, taking on and solving problems, and
generally randomly wandering about the universe. With a
small bit of effort on the part of the referee, however, a
campaign can be structured to be much, much more.
There are four (sometimes five) seeds to a good cam·
paign . Any referee should have them in his (or her) mind
when creating any situation which is to continue for more
than one session. These seeds are called the basics, the push,
the pull, and the gimmick. The optional fifth seed is the
enigma.
The Basics: Maybe the thought of the basics is obvious,
but it often gets overlooked. The rules for Traveller are pre·
sented in this book, but there are certain basic facts which
the referee must provide. First and foremost is is the map
and an idea of what lies within the map (and why). Con·
sider any modern map - it may have place names scattered
about, but even a grade school education enables a reader
to see beyond the names: the center of South America is
jungle; some countries are democracies or dictatorships;
they may be rich or poor; they may be allies or enemies of
their neighbors. The same background is required for a
subsector map. The referee needs to give some critical
thought to the political organization of the areas shown: is
there an empire, a federation, an unsettled frontier? How
does the government interact with its citizens: is it benevol·
ent or oppressive, or is its presence even felt? These basics
may well be sketched out ideas: rough maps where the
holes can be filled in later. But these basics need to be
there, or the players will later find themselves wandering
into inconsistencies.
At a minimum, the basics should address the subsector
map, interstellar government, and local technological levels.
As needed, the referee may add more basics to the cam·
paign, including animal encounter tables, local organizations
of importance, world and local laws, history, and
other foundations. With the basics available, it is possible to
set any mundane adventure without further preparation.
The only problem is that such adventures will be mundane;
there is no real spirit of excitement behind them. The
campaign needs more.
The Gimmick: Any campaign needs gimmicks to appeal
to the players. Early on, they have no idea what is of
importance in a grand sense, and will be self-centered to a
certain extent. Gimmicks are designed to appeal to the
players, enabling them to search for obviously valuable
items while they also learn about their universe. Gimmicks
(some say the word is derived from gimmee) are things that
players want: things they are fascinated with. In Traveller,
they rank above money or ordinary ships; they must
represent some advantage, such as high technology or
special talents. The Psionic Institute is an example of a
gimmick sought early on by most characters - it meets one
definition of a gimmick: an advantage the player has over
most people.
Gimmicks are things which cannot be bought - they
Referee's Guide to Adventuring
must be earned through hard work, clever planning, and
good fortune. Keep in mind that gimmicks are things that
are acquired early by the players, and which then serve the
person (and the group) for the rest of the campaign.
The Pull: The pull is a simple name for a goal that
attracts adventurers, much like a magnet attracts iron. It
can be as simple as a fabled mineral deposit on a distant
world, or as complex as a secret formula that will keep the
sun from going nova - to be found within a certain time
limit.
Pulls need a lot of thought, and often must be tailored
to players in the campaign. When one player is an anthro·
pologist and is interested in primitive cultures, the pull can
be the secret of some race on a far-off world, one which
allows the player to use his talents to puzzle it out after
long expeditions. If a player tends to be a violence-prone
soldier, then the pull may be a long-sought bit of training
from a military society, available only after he has proven
his worth.
Often, a campaign can do with two pulls. One may be
major and the other minor, but a multiplicity of pulls
allows one to be important while the other lies dormant
until needed. Shifting emphasis can make the total cam·
paign realistic; a realistic course for the action is rarely a
straightforward path directly to the adventurer's seeming
goal.
The Push: The push is (obviously) the opposite of the
pull. It is something the players do not especially like, but
it keeps cropping up anyway. The push can be relatively
simple, like law officers, or relatively complex, like a
nefarious group or race intent on conquering the universe.
As with pulls, there can be multiple pushes, some large
and some small. Pushes also have a benefit for the referee:
they can come into play when the referee wants to push
someone. If the group is wasting time in some place and the
action should really move on, then over the hill comes a
horde of barbarians, the same ones that have been following
the group for weeks, and that everyone knows are blood·
thirsty killers. "Quick," the group says, "let's move on!"
The Enigma: There is always something that the players
will not understand. They may not realize that the emperor
who holds ultimate political power also controls (more
subtly) the economic power of the major corporations in
the region, or that some worlds are being slowly strangled
by a major corporation, in order to gain political control.
As clues are presented, the group learns more and more
about a larger situation, which they can then deal with to
their benefit, or to someone else's benefit. This enigma is,
on a large scale, the secret of the universe; on a smaller scale,
it is still a secret worth knowing. ·
Early in a campaign, the players may not even know
what the enigma is. Later, when presented with several
clues, the group may realize that there is a puzzle, but have
no idea of its solution. Still later, they may have all of the
information (perhaps in the form of raw data still to be
refined) and need to find an analyst to decode it. Finally,
with the secret at their disposal, they will need to decide
how to use this information. Doling out the clues and
information slowly can make the campaign an intense,
interesting cliffhanger until the very end.

Into the Subsector
The adventures are ready to begin. The following chapters present a wealth of information for the players and the referee,
and should provide hours of enjoyment for everyone.
The General Situation: After each player has generated a character, the entire group has assembled through friendship,
chance, or some other reason. They find themselves in an establishment just outside the gates of the Regina starport. Regina
is capital of the Regina subsector of the Spinward Marches, a frontier sector on the very edge of the Imperium. More infor·
mation is available in later chapters of this book about Regina, the Spinward Marches, and the Imperium.
Beginning Adventures: Initially, this book's basic rules provide several ideas for things to do. They include:
Find a Psionic Institute: Looking for psionic testing and training is always an interesting pursuit. The actual quest for
the Institute is often a side venture as the group travels on other missions.
Trade and Speculation: Engaging in commercial ventures appeals to the basic profit motive that most players have. It
enables them to progress in terms they readily understand, and to use their rewards for other activities.
The Scenarios: Presented below and on the following pages are patron encounters, a casual encounter, an amber zone,
and two short adventures. As the group travels throughout the Regina subsector, these scenarios should be presented and
played. Between these scenarios, the referee can make up additional scenarios and present them to the players. After these
situations are completed, the referee can produce others to provide even more adventure.
PATRON ENCOUNTERS
The following patron encounters may be imposed
whenever the appropriate patron is rolled on the patron
encounter table. If necessary (because of the situation, or
because the group is on an appropriate planet), the referee
may impose a patron.
In each patron encounter, the referee should provide
the players' information to the players, but keep the
referee's information secret. After rolling one die, the
result will indicate which choice should be implemented.
Because of th is random result system, each patron encounter
can be slightly rephrased and used again with a
different response.
The Newlyweds Patron: Playboy or Noble
Players' Information: The group is contacted by a newly
married couple, who decline to give their names, but have
reason to believe that their respective parents are not
pleased with their union. They will pay Cr3000 to each
member of a group which will escort them safely to a
planet beyond their parents' sphere of influence.
Referee's Information: This situation is the classic
Romeo and Juliet scenario. The couple is insistent on remaining
together and genuinely afraid of their fam ilies'
reactions.
1. The couple has overestimated their parents' reaction.
No attempt is being made to have either one kidnapped or
murdered. Naturally, in the course of a normal interstellar
voyage, a group of this size obviously travelling in fear of
something is bound to attract both official and unofficial
attention.
. 2. Agents of the woman's family will attempt to kidnap
her. The number of kidnappers involved should be adjusted
by the referee based on the adventurers' weaponry and
abil ities.
3 . Agents of the man's family will attempt to kidnap the
man. The number of kidnappers should be adjusted by the
referee based on the adventurers' weaponry and abil ities.
4. Agents of the man's family will attempt to have the
woman killed.
5. Agents of the woman's family will attempt to have
the man killed.
6. Both families will simultaneously attempt to kill one
of the couple and kidnap the other. Two independent
groups should be created by the referee.
The Nervous Merchant Patron: Merchant
Players' Information: A nervous looking gentleman, who
identifies himself as John Smith, a local businessman,
approaches the party. Hastening to state that this is the first
time that he has ever attempted such a thing, he lays the
following job offer before the group.
A competitor, Anselm Beauchamp by name, will be
arriving in two days aboard the passenger liner Concordia.
If Beauchamp is allowed to complete his task on planet, it

The Traveller Book
will mean financial ruin for the patron. What he wishes the
group to do is to kidnap Beauchamp and hold him for three
weeks, during which time the patron will profit greatly
from his absence. Beauchamp must not know why he is
being detained, or who is responsible. The patron will
provide a secluded mountain villa in which Beauchamp may
be held, and will pay Cr15,000 to the group upon Beauchamp's
safe release.
Referee's Information: The Concordia is a standard R
class subsidized merchant. Unless otherwise stated, normal
security procedures in effect aboard ship will have to be
generated by the referee.
1. All is as represented.
2. Beauchamp arrives as expected aboard the Concordia,
but is accompanied by a bodyguard. The referee should
generate a suitable character for each role.
3. Beauchamp arrives as expected, but has two bodyguards.
4. Beauchamp is being sought by two assassins hired by
another competitor. The referee should work out events
according to the individual situation. The patron will not
pay if Beauchamp is killed.
5. In addition to Beauchamp, a high official of the
Imperial government and his twelve-man escort of Imperial
marines are aboard the Concordia.
6 . Beauchamp is not aboard the Concordia. The referee
should determine why. Perhaps he took a later ship, an
earlier ship, or cancelled his trip entirely. The referee must
decide other considerations according to individual circumstances.
The Lady in White Robes Patron: Noble
Players' Information: While resting in a hotel lobby
between ships, the players are approached by a young lady
in flowing white robes who identifies herself as the
daughter of a local noble. Her brother, she says, has been
kidnapped by a local criminal organization. He was once a
member of that organization, but his conscience got the
better of him and he contacted the Imperials, offering to
turn Crown's evidence. He is now being held in a mountain
villa, while they torture him to determine how much he
revealed. The Imperial authorities think he is dead, and will
not help.
She offers Cr300,000 for the rescue of her brother. and
the safe transport of both of them offplanet. She produces
a map of the villa, scrawled on a napkin.
At this point, two uniformed police and a third man in
civilian clothes approach, taking the girl prisoner. The
civilian identifies himself as a doctor at a local mental
hospital, explains the girl is a patient there, and apologizes
for any inconvenience her wild tales might have caused the
party. The girl struggles and screams that they are going to
kill her.
Referee's Information: The doctor will quiet the girl
with a hypo and the trio will carry her away. A library
terminal is handy.
1. The police (really the organization's thugs in disguise)
will hail a cab and carry the girl onto it. A check of the
library will reveal that the girl and her brother are the only
heirs of a local noble (recently killed under suspicious
Into the Subsector
circumstances). There is no mental hospital of the name
given on the planet. The referee must determine the flow of
subsequent events.
2-4. The police carry the girl to a waiting unmarked car.
library data will reveal that the girl really has a brother,
they are the only heirs of a local noble, and that there
really is a mental hospital of that name on the planet.
Further investigation will reveal more data, which should be
adjusted by the referee to the method of investigation and
given out as rumors. The girl is being held there by the
organization, who own the hospital. The police are genuine,
but know noth ing of the situation at the hospital.
5-6. All is as it seems. The girl is the daughter of a local
noble, but has no brother. The mental hospital really exists.
The police are genuine. The referee should determine the
flow of subsequent events.
The Raggedy Old Man Patron: Peasant
Players' Information: While between flights the group is
contacted by a shabbily dressed man who seems to be
suffering from a severe allergy. His grandfather, he tells the
group, served in the Imperial Army Quartermaster Corps
during the border skirmishes of the 1080's. His grandfather's
diary, which has only recently come into his hands,
indicates that in the closing days of the battle for the
Menorb system a quantity of valuable materials was loaded
on the wrong ship and transferred to his control. The ship
the goods were to have been on was destroyed with all
hands, and instead of reporting the incident, the man's
grandfather hid the crates. Before he could sell the goods,
however, he was mortally wounded in an attack on the
headquarters and never regained consciousness. Since the
war, the Menorb system has recovered, but certain areas
remain off-limits. The planetoid where the goods are
concealed is located on the edge of the system, and he feels
the odds are good that it has escaped destruction over the
years. He does not know for certain what the diverted
material was, but he notes that it is referred to in the diary
as "the dope". He needs a ship to find the goods and
transport them to a planet where they can be sold. He
offers a 50/50 split of the proceeds.
Referee's Information: Imperial ships guarding the off.
limits area of the Menorb system in which the planetoid is
located should be chosen by the referee according to the
size and armament of the players' ship. If captured, the
players will be assumed to be spies.
1. The diverted consignment is undamaged. It consists of
one Imperial mobile field surgery and two tons of pharmaceuticals
(primarily medical drug) . The surgery weighs one
and one-half tons, and cannot be resold legally. The drugs
are in civil labels, and should present no real problems in
resale. The referee should determine the results of any
attempt to sell the goods.
2-3. The cache contains four tons, not two.
4. The consignment has been damaged, and only the
field surgery survives intact.
5. The consignment consists of 4 tons of medical drug,
and one ton of an illegal (and very valuable) anagathics.
6. A meteor shower occupies the orbit where the diary
indicates the planetoid was located.

CASUAL ENCOUNTER
This casual encounter with Shawna provides the potent
ial for a number of situations.
Shawna 9DAA87 Age 38
3 terms Cr10,000 to 30,000
Bribery-1, Forgery-2, Streetwise-1 , Auto Pistol-1
Automatic Pistol
Shawna is a con-artist, a perpetrator of complex, dangerous,
and extremely profitable scams and swindles. She is
of medium height and build, but otherwise her appearance
varies considerably, since she often wears disguises while
engaged in an operation. Not even her closest associates are
sure what she really looks like, or how old she is. Her name
is as big a mystery as her true appearance. Shawna is merely
what her close associates call her.
Given time and the proper equipment, she can forge or
alter almost any document, but Shawna prefers to work
with officially issued documents, such as replacement
identity papers.
Shawna, although a criminal , is not completely without
principles. She prefers to rob individuals or organizations
known for their shady deal ings, stringently avoids murder
in her schemes, never rips off a close associate, and never
leaves her lesser confederates in a situation where they will
be in grave danger. She does, however, detest incompe-
Game Designers' Workshop
tence, and will desert confederates who have gotten themselves
into trouble by their own stupidity. Shawna will
avenge herself on any who have upset one of her schemes,
more persistently and viciously the larger the amount of
money she loses.
Shawna is intelligent and quick-thinking, attributes
which have served her well in her chosen line of work. Her
schemes are tightly-woven and intricate, generally involving
several close associates and a horde of lesser perpetrators,
none of whom are conversant with the entire plot for
security reasons. Her schemes generally involve stock
swindles, phony investment schemes, or some form of
complex economic manipulation designed to relieve a
greedy company or official of several million credits.
Although she may allow an associate to make the initial
contact, Shawna prefers to personally interview everyone
involved in one of her schemes. She is reluctant to trust
anyone but herself with this task, and often this means her
larger schemes take months or years to set up. This personal
control of her operations is the reason for her unbel ievable
success in a field where failure is common.
Shawna's crimes are well-known in both underworld and
law-enforcement circles, and she has achieved a small degree
of renown in popular literature, although most of this
is fictional. She circulates false (often contradictory) stories
about her past, for reasons she alone knows.
Shawna has amassed a personal fortune of unknown size,
which she holds in bank accounts at various locations
around the Regina subsector. The Cr10,000 to Cr30,000
indicated above represents what she keeps on hand for
advances on salaries or for small debts incurred while a
scheme is in progress. She can write bank drafts or checks
for amounts up to Cr200,000 with little problem.
Shawna could be encountered almost anywhere, under
many possible sets of circumstances.
- The players could be approached by Shawna with
an offer to participate in a scheme. This could involve the
players in almost any action, from direct involvement in
the central part of the scheme to a peripheral diversionary
action. If the players appear to be fouling up the scheme,
however, Shawna will probably leave them holding the bag.
- One of Shawna's victims, seeking revenge, might hire
the players to kill or kidnap her, or to catch her in a swin·
die of their own which will regain the victim's lost money.
- The players could be in the employ of Shawna's
target, and either be approached by Shawna to help in the
scheme, or get wind of it themselves (with the option of
either joining in or thwarting it).
- The players might stumble onto the con-game by
accident, and demand a share of the proceeds or accidently
ruin it, in either case incurring Shawna's wrath.
- The players might be hired by a law enforcement
agency or by the security branch of a large corporation
to capture Shawna and her associates or to penetrate
her operation.
Her greatest weaknesses are pride and an unwillingness
to abandon a scheme which has obviously gone sour. This
tenacity often leads her to take risks, often involving
great personal danger to herself and her confederates
in a last ditch effort to revive a dying scam.

The Traveller Book
AMBER ZONE
This amber zone takes place on the world of Heya, a
backwater in the Regina subsector. It could as easily be
placed on any world with a reasonable hydrographic
percentage. Note that, like most amber zone scenarios,
it does not take place on an amber zone coded world.
Players' Information: In the course of seeking gainful
employment, the adventurers are contacted by a represen·
tative of Sternmetal Horizons, LIC.
The initial survey of Heya (0802-8687745-5) was performed
several hundred years ago, and it was deemed
devoid of exploitable resources. The planet has been a
backwater for many years. Recently, there have been
rumors that the initial report was forged, and that extensive
and valuable mineral deposits lie hidden in the region
known as the Hamantt, a dense jungle area in the center of
this world's only continent. Sternmetal sent an undercover
survey team into the region several months ago, but their
report was never received. Investigation revealed that the
team had completed the survey and was returning to the
starport via a tourist excursion steamer when the ship was
attacked by a band of terrorists.
The wreck of the steamer was never located, and the
local government officials are reluctant to speak of it. Apparently,
only a cursory investigation was made, as the area
was (and still is) infested with guerrillas hostile to the local
government.
Sternmetal Horizons, LIC, will pay Cr2,000,000 for the
recovery of the lost survey report, or Cr100,000 for the
location of the wreck of the ship. They provide the following
additional information:
The government of Heya is desperate for tourism (virtually
its only means of getting off-planet currency) which
has been on the wane since the rebell ion in the outback
began. They have, therefore, taken steps to conceal the
extent of the rebellion and restricted tourists to the rela·
tively safe areas south of the capital.
Locally available transport includes ATVs (renting for
Cr300 per week) and local beasts of burden similar to
[[Terra|Terran]] mules (Crl per week; each carries 100 kg); the party
is legally required to hire one guide for each vehicle or ten
beasts, at Cr100 each per day.
Due to the activities of the rebels, import restrictions on
weapons are very tight, but Sternmetal has arranged for a
quantity of weapons to be smuggled on-planet (one auto
rifle and 200 rounds of ammunition for each member of
the group).
The party may retain the weapons after the mission is
completed, but are responsible for getting them off-planet.
Standard operating procedures for clandestine operations
of this nature permit Sternmetal to describe the likely
nature of the container in which the report will be found.
Referee's Information: The referee should prepare a
rough map of the terrain to be expected. Heya's only
continent is roughly hand-shaped (with six fingers) and
10,000 km across at its widest point. The fingers are
extremely fertile lowlands. The palm of the hand is highland
and the source of many rivers which irrigate the
lowlands. The Hamantt is the central jungle from which the
rivers flow. Heya's starport (Atarishii Down) is adjacent to
Into the Subsector
Hilung, the world's capital and major city. Hilung is a
seaport at the mouth of a great river flowing out of the
Hamantt. Most other cities on the world are small, and
farming-oriented. The tourist steamer was sunk in about 50
meters of water in a large lake (about 150 km by 300 km)
located some 2400 km away.
Animal encounter tables for prairie, rough, and jungle
terrain on Heya are included in the back of this book.
For each week (200 km per week, assuming local beasts
of burden; 1600 km in an ATV) spent travelling to or from
the lake, or spent in the search for the wreck of the ship,
roll 6+ for the party to be attacked by guerrillas. If 10+ is
rolled, the party is taken completely by surprise. The
referee should adjust size and armament of attacking
guerrillas to the size of the party.
After the arrival at the lake, two die rolls should be
made to determine if the wreck of the ship can be located
and the report recovered.
Throw 12+ for location of the wreck; OM +4 if using
sonar or metal detection equipment, +5 if diving equipment
is used (these rolls are additive). This roll may be made only
once per week.
Throw 8+ for recovery of the report; OM -6 if no diving
equipment is used. This roll may be made only once per
week, after the wreck has been located.
The referee should determine the likelihood of arms and
equipment being destroyed by guerrilla attacks, and the
possibility of diving equipment being fabricated on the
spot.
Note: The party will have to deal with the guide(s) in
some fashion (kill them, bribe them, etc.) before venturing
north of the city, or the party will be intercepted and
arrested by units of the local army. Guides are armed with
automatic pistols (one each).
If the party returns to Hilung with the arms they will be
arrested unless they have taken measures to conceal them.
Some means of explaining the absence of the guide(s) if
they have been killed will have to be devised before the
locals will allow the party to leave Heya.
The weapons may be sold outside the city for 1 0 x 10%
of their book value. Selling them will take 20 weeks, OM
-2 per level of streetwise in the group. Roll 8+ for the
local police to discover the deal and arrest all involved.

Shadows
This short adventure, entitled Shadows, is a complete adventure for Traveller. It concerns a mysterious pyramid structure
on the surface of Yorbund, a world in the Regina subsector, and the efforts of a band of travellers to investigate it . It is
assumed that this adventure will be administered by a referee who has read through it completely, and who is familiar with
both it and the rules of Traveller presented in this book. All rules necessary for this short adventure are contained in this
book. Other materials which may prove necessary include note paper, graph paper, pencils or pens, and six-sided dice.
For Referees Only: This entire adventure is for the Traveller referee. Players should not be allowed to read any part of it
unless specifically directed to by the rules or referee. However, once the referee has read these two pages, they may be made
ava ilable to the players for their reference. Of special interest is the situation and the illustration of the pyramid.
STANDARDS AND ASSUMPTIONS
The following standards and assumptions are used:
Current Date: 190·11 05
Dates: Dates herein correspond to the Imperial calendar.
The init ial date for this situation is 190·1105; 190 is the
current day (the 190th day of the year) in the standard
365-day year; 1105 is the current year in the Imperium.
Once the adventure begins, time should flow normally.
Location: Yorbund, Regina Subsector
Location: This adventure takes place on the world of
Yorbund (0703-C7C6503·7), in the Regina subsector of the
Spinward Marches of the Imperium. Yorbund is 11 ,000
kilometers in diameter, with an insidious corrosive atmo·
sphere, and seas of a similar corrosive fluid covering 60% of
its surface. Yorbund has a population of 227,000 persons,
with no established government. A generally accepted law
level of 3 prohibits energy weapons and autorifles. Local
technological level is 7, equivalent to the period 1970 to
1979 (only lim ited manufacturing of TL 7 materials is
possible, due to the low population base) . The local star·
port is classed as type C, and is located near the major
population center of the world.
Much of Yorbund is unexplored, with the population
concentrated in a few underground complexes. Yorbund's
major resource is fungi grown in the caverns; it provides
food, fibers, and fuel, and is exported as pharmaceuticals.
Starport: Marion Starport is classified as type C, provi·
ding poor quality facilities with no repair or shipbuilding
operations. Unrefined fuel is available at Cr100 per ton.
CHARACTERS
Any group of characters may set out on this particular
adventure. For best results, however, the group should
include certain skills and equipment.
Equipment: The group should have a ship; a type S
scout/courier is ideal. If the group does not have a ship,
the referee may alter the situation sufficiently to allow
running this adventure anyway. For example, the group
may be hired onto a free trader in this area, or they may
take passage on a tramp liner.
In any case, the characters' should have access to a ship's
locker equipped as shown below (it may have more equ ip·
ment, but should have at least what is shown).
Skills: The group will find the following skills useful
in the course of the adventure: electronic, gunnery, mech·
anical, medical, navigation, and vacc suit. Weapons skills
may also prove useful. If necessary, the referee may allow
the use of various default skills (such as vacc su it·O or
carbine-0) to fill in gaps in personal skills.
EQUIPMENT
Characters should review their equipment and may
wish to purchase more. Any equipment listed in this book
may be purchased, subject to the following restrictions:
1. It must be listed in this book.
2. It must not exceed tech level 7 (the local tech level).
3. It must be paid for. This requirement will preclude
many items because of cost.
SHIP'S LOCKER
eight vacc suits, each with oxygen tanks for eight hours
and short range communicators
four carbines, each with ten loaded magazines
two automatic pistols, each with ten loaded magazines
four cutlasses, each with a belt scabbard
one long range communicator
AVAILABLE EQUIPMENT TABLE
Cable- fine flexible plasteel cable, capable of supporting
250 kilograms. Available in 50 meter coils, each coil weigh·
ing 3 kilograms. Up to ten coils are available. Price: Cr100
per coil.
Revolver Shotshells- cartridges for revolvers loaded with
shot instead of normal bullets. In use, these shells allow the
character to use the group hits by shotguns rule when firing
the revolver. Wounding per round is 1D, and such a weapon
may not fire at long range. Not available for automatic
pistols. Price: six cartridges cost Cr10.
Atmosphere Tester- a solid-state device indicating atmo·
spheric elements present. A red light glows if the atmosphere
is not breathable, and a green light glows if the
atmosphere is breathable. Three are available, serial num·
bers 1099-5768·3 , 1099-5769-3, and 1099-4792·2. Weight:
1 kilogram. Price: Cr150 each.

SHADOWS
After a call at Marion Starport on Yorbund, consisting
of a complete refueling and a visit to the minor attractions
of the caverns of Yorbund, the band of adventurers pre·
pared for a routine take-off, bound outsystem for Kinorb.
In the last few seconds before lift-off, however, a seismic
tremor shook the field, disrupting the count-down. AI·
thou~ lift-off took place on schedule, the possibility
remains that the ship sustained damage from the tremor.
The adventurers place it in orbit while routine checks are
run on all ship's systems for possible malfunction. After
three hours, all readings indicate negative problems.
However, the ship's scanners have detected a surface
feature of some interest on Yorbund. Located far into
unsettled territory, and not appearing on any maps, the
feature appeared in a break in the almost perpetual overcast.
An aerial view of the feature is shown below. Extensive
use of the ship's computer on the image data in memory
gradually expands the information available, although
additional images are obscured by the overcast and the
nature of the atmosphere below. The three-pyramid com·
plex appears to be constructed of stone having a hi~
metal content, with a high probability of voids within the
structure, although none of high volume. The feature
appears to be old, constructed (rather than natural), and
not of human origin. It appears safe for an exploratory
expedition.
The landing at Marion Starport provided some basic
Shadows
background to the travellers which it would be well to
remember.
1. The local atmosphere is insidious, corrosive, and will
defeat all personal protective measures within eight hours.
The adventurers did not go outside at the starport, acces·
sing facilities through tunnels and portals. Their vacc suits
remain in prime condition. Once the suits are exposed
to the local atmosphere, they will need reconditioning, at
high cost in money (Cr200 each) and time (at least a week).
2. Yorbund is largely unexplored, with few individuals
venturing far from the starport and associated caverns.
Cloaked in a dense overcast atmosphere, little is known of
the surface features of the world. As experience has shown,
Yorbund is subject to seismic tremors, generally of low
magnitude, but sometimes quite severe; such tremors have
been detected from nearly all points on the world's surface.
Finally, the planet is known to be subject to considerable
volcanism .
3. The ship is fueled, and can maneuver for some time,
even land several times if necessary, and still jump out·
system. In all probability, questions would be asked at the
starport if the ship returned there, and Marion Starport is
the only source of fuel insystem.
Deciding to investigate the feature, the ship descends to
the world surface, and follows a flight path to land within a
kilometer of the complex. In the last few seconds of the
approach, an energy blast passes within meters of the ship,
131

almost disabling it. Instrumentation shows that the beam
came from the pyramids. Computer readouts indicate that
the ship will probably (80% chance) be shot down if it
attempts to take off without the beam being disabled.
INSIDE THE PYRAMIDS
The pyramid complex is obviously an artifact con·
structed by some race (human or other), by all appearances
Diagram 1
Game Designen' Wortcahop
at some date in the far past. The adventurers are forced to
investigate it in detail.
ENTRY POINTS
The computer view of the complex indicates no obvious
points of entry into the pyramids; it does show several
possibilities, each of which may be investigated. Each entry
below describes the location, indicates throws to use while
investigating, and then details the results to be
implemented by the referee.
1. The empty shaft on the platform appears to
have vents or drainage pipes at its base. The vents are
obvious to the observer. The shaft has a depth of
nearly 10 meters. The twin openings at the bottom of
the shaft will accept a crawling person after the protective
metal bars are cut away (with cutting equipment
or energy weapon: ten minutes, another ten
minutes to remove the stubs in order to avoid cutting
into the vacc suit when crawling through). Entrance
leads to location 32 on the power plant level.
2. One or more of the statuary figures on the
platform (or atop the pyramid) may be movable to
reveal an entry. Fifteen minutes of close checking will
show that none of the figures in the parallel rows on
the platform are movable; throw 9+ for any one
character to deduce that some of the broken figures
show solid construction, and are not movable. This
saves the 15 minutes.
The single figure atop the pyramid is constructed
so as to pivot (throw 9+ per five minutes, OM +3 if
intel B+, to so note). Strength characteristics totalling
13 are required to move it. It reveals a vertical shaft
of great depth. A dim light glows within. The shaft is
shown entering the top of diagram 1. Descending this
shaft will require cable, and a swinging motion once
partway down. The upper level is location 1 on the
interior level. The lower level is location 15 on the
deep level.
3. Either of the stairways may have some indica·
tion of a concealed doorway. Regardless of how long
these areas are checked, they will reveal nothing; but
no definite proof will appear that there is no entry.
The referee should roll (secretly, and disregarding the
outcome) for each five minutes spent checking. A
doorway may be discovered in the long stairway from
the inside (at location 1) and forced open (from
inside, by a combined strength characteristic of
13+).
4. As in [[Terra|Terran]] pyramids, a shah entrance may be
concealed on the face of one or more of the pyramids,
probably in shadow. Such a search will prove fruitless.
5. Finally, the flat upper surface of the small
pyramid may have some sort of entry. There is none.
However, the surface does have a temperature
substantially higher than the environment (about 100
degrees C, the boiling point of water).
Brute Force: The idea of brute force may well
occur to the adventurers. Personal weapons will have
virtually no effect on the surfaces of the complex,
although a blast from an energy weapon at the long

The Traveller Book
stairway on the pyramid will reveal the doorway
there. If a ship's laser is used, it will cut
a 1.5 meter hole for each hit (assumed good
accuracy at this range), but will also provoke
an energy blast from the nearest face of the
large pyramid. Such fire will be returned
on a one-for-one basis; throw 8+ for the
return fire to hit the ship. The first hit will
blow a hole in the hull, causing minor
damage (referee determines what portion of
the ship is hit, and results; take into account
hatches, interior compartmentation, and
corrosion effects of the atmosphere), the
second will disable the jump drives, and the
third will disable the laser. The ship's laser
fire will not affect return fire from the
pyramid.
INTERIOR FEATURES
The nature of the interior of the complex
should come as a distinct surprise to its
violators. While the outside of the structure
is angular and regular, the interior is curved and rounded.
Large Chamben: Diagram 2 shows a typical large chamber
(such as location 11) with a curved ceiling and side
access to a corridor. Note the sunken central floor area,
drainage, and ceiling vent. The curved line at the top is a
lighting fixture which produces a dull glow sufficient for
most vision requirements. Locations 1 and 9 are similar in
shape and layout, although they both have deep central
shafts.
Corridon: Connecting the interior chambers are round
corridors as shown in diagram 3. The left-hand (larger) cor·
ridor is typical of those connecting major areas, while the
smaller corridor is typical of those connecting side chambers,
or leading to the power plant level (from location
13). These corridors have a ceiling plate which provides
light, and a flat platform at the bottom which provides a
pathway for individuals.
This platform appears to be made of iron sheets and is
suspended without visible means of support several centi·
meters above the bottom of the corridor; obviously magnetism
is at work. Individuals stepping onto the platform
will cause it to settle slightly, but never enough
to touch the corridor wall. Liquefied vapor settles
to the bottom of the corridors and accumulates
below the platforms. Above the corridors, a vent is
concealed in the body of the pyramid; below the
corridors, a drain pipe is similarly concealed. These
connections are visible in large chambers, or at the
fracture in the large corridor on the interior level.
Small Chamber: Diagram 4 shows a cross section
of a large corridor and two small adjoining chambers,
an arrangement typical of the small chambers.
Locations 4, 6, 8, and 20 have lower-level platform
floors within; locations 2, 3, 5, 7, and 19 have
higher-level platforms.
Note the large curved doors, suspended on
magnetic fields. For each, throw 9+ for the door to
be in the open position. Closed doors may be
Shadows
Diagram 2
opened by brute strength , applying 13+ in strength charac·
teristic, and then propping the door open with a bar,
tool, or weapon. Open doors will prove very difficult to
close. In the event of a seismic tremor, any doors may
change position on 7+ unless already propped open.
Note the magnetic platform floors. Such floors are
similar to the platforms in the corridors, but span the full
width of the small chambers, leaving a very small gap (only
a few centimeters) at the edges. In rooms with high level
floors, virtually the only way to gain access to the area
beneath the floor requires several persons (at least two) at
one side, tilting the platform near the entrance corridor; the
gap which results will allow a person to slip into the chamber
below. If done improperly, the explorer can get trapped
(throw 8+ to get trapped; OM +1 for each person counterweighting
the platform in excess of 2). If trapped, throw 7+
for the vacc suit to be torn while being retrieved; OM + vacc
suit skill.
Environment: The interior of the pyramid complex is
interesting for its atmosphere, lighting, and temperature.
Diagram 3
133

134
Shadows
Atmosphere: In gaseous content, the interior atmosphere
is similar to that on the world surface. However,
vents and passages constantly keep the atmosphere in circulation.
In most cases, the atmosphere is transparent, but
close to floors, in depressions, and under the metal corridor
platforms, it has condensed to a pinkish vapor, opaque to
visible and infrared light. The vapor can also be seen wafting
down from ceiling vents, and accumulating to a depth of
about ten centimeters. When (and if) analyzed, the atmosphere
tester light glows red. The vapor will show a high
percentage of halogens in addition to the expected gases.
Lighting: All interior rooms and corridors are lighted
with a dull glow from ceiling panels. Close examination will
show (to one with electronic skill) that these panels use a
form of electroluminescence, drawing electric current (in
low wattage) from connections directly in the body of the
pyramids. Shooting or breaking a specific panel (they run
about 6 meters long) will not extinguish it unless the entire
panel is broken. Two areas (locations 20 and 23) on the
deep level are in darkness, and close examination will
show that the light panels in these areas have been deliberately
broken to put them out.
Temperature: Temperature is remarkably constant
within the complex, staying at a steady 20 degrees C at
chest height. However, this temperature varies with height
within the chambers. Near the ceiling, it rises to 25 or
even 30 degrees; near the floor, it reaches 10 degrees.
This differential contributes to the maintenance of the
vapor near the floor. An individual with electronic skill will
deduce that this effect is produced by solid-state electromagnetic
effects.
The Faults: Two locations show evidence within the
interior of the pyramid complex. One, in a horizontal
corridor on the interior level, and shown in section in diagram
5, has occurred where the corridor tubes have changed
orientation slightly. Someone with navigation skill may
notice (throw 9+; OM +2 if intel B+) that the fault corres·
ponds to the juncture between the two adjacent pyramids.
The meaning of this fact is not obvious. Visible at the
horizontal fault are the upper vent and lower drain pipe,
with opaque vapor drifting down from above. A second
fault (at location 14 on diagram 1) is located in the vertical
Game Oesignen' Workshop
shaft leading down from location 1 to location 15. This
fault is not as obvious as the horizontal fault, and will
probably not be discovered unless inspected as adventurers
move down the shaft. Note that a similar shaft connects
locations 9 and 21, but does not have a fault in its length.
Diagram 5
THE INOIVIOUALLOCATIONS
Locations on the floor plans range from 1 through 32,
each of which denotes an area of potential interest. By
investigation of these areas, the adventurers may well
discover what should have become by now their defacto
goal : to find the controls of the complex's self-defense
beam and disable them in order to allow their ship to leave
again - all within the eight hours imposed by the local
atmosphere's effects on their vacc suits.
Although the band may feel that splitting up will provide
the greatest chance at results, this should not be
allowed, regardless of how many are in the group. There is
safety in numbers, and the band should be so informed; in
addition, single groups are more efficiently handled by the
referee. Should they insist on splitting up, each band should
receive a negative OM of at least - 3 on all throws until the
bands reunite.
It should be assumed that movement takes little time,

The Traveller Book
but that careful search can be very time consuming. As a
result, apply the following time spans:
A. To move from one location to an adjacent location
(except changing levels) : two or three minutes.
B. To casually look into a location: two or three minutes.
C. To carefully search a room, sufficient to attempt the
throw for success in the search: ten minutes.
Other times are given with specific areas or locations, as
necessary.
INTERIOR LEVEL LOCATIONS (1-13)
The following locations are situated on the interior level:
1. Large Chamber. This chamber, on the interior level,
is the area entered from the shaft leading down from the
statue atop the pyramid. Its center is also a shaft leading
down some 95 meters to the deep level. Essentially a
simple walkway surrounding the shaft, this chamber is bare
of any features, and does not even include fixtures on
which to fasten cable or rope.
2. Small Chamber. Throw 9+ for the door to be open.
This chamber has a high level floor, and is reached by
climbing up a set of raised stair rungs and passing through a
doorway onto the metal floor. The upper area is empty,
except for some dirt and debris. For careful search , throw
5+: if successful, it will reveal that the dirt and debris is
animal droppings, and that the area under the floor is
emitting noises as if there are animals down there. If a
character manages to get below the floor, a set of animal
lairs will become apparent; consult the encounter tables.
3. Small Chamber. Throw 9+ for the door to be open.
This chamber has a high level floor, and is reached by
climbing up a set of raised stair rungs and passing through a
doorway onto a metal floor. The upper area is filled with
boxes made of pressed board, all now empty. Careful search
(throw 8+; OM +2 if more than 4 persons are searching)
reveals that indeed none of the boxes are full; they appear
to be natural organic products. Additional search below the
floor (requires ten minutes; use the procedure above)
reveals that the entire lower area is filled with a pool of
vapor.
4. Small Chamber. Throw 9+ for the door to be open.
This chamber has a low level f loor, all of which is covered
with soil; growing in the soil is a profusion of plants.
Careful search (throw 6+; OM +1 for mechanical skill in any
degree) requires actually getting down into the soil and
moving it with the hands; it will reveal that the area is
cultivated rather than wild or natural, although the time
between visits for care appear to be on the order of years.
The plants are actually fungi, and appear to be nearing a
ripe or mature stage.
5. Small Chamber. Throw 9+ for the door to be open.
This chamber is similar to location 3, and should be administered
like it. However, the area under the f loor is
only half-filled with vapor.
6. Small Chamber. Throw 9+ for the door to be open.
This chamber is similar to location 4, and should be administered
like it. However, if a careful search is performed,
those involved will be attacked by crawlers automatically.
See animal encounters.
7. Small Chamber. Throw 9+ for the door to be open.
Shadows
This chamber is similar to location 3, and should be administered
like it. However, the upper area is empty (obvious
to casual search), and the lower area is empty of
vapor. Careful search of the lower area (throw 6+; OM +3
for electric torches or cold lights) reveal debris similar to
the animal droppings in location 2.
8. Small Chamber. Throw 9+ for the door to be open.
This chamber is similar to location 4, but there is virtually
no plant life present; what material is present appears to be
immature specimens.
9. Large Central Chamber. This chamber is similar to
location 1, with the following exceptions. First, there is no
shaft leading upward. Second, suspended from the ceiling is
a thick knobby cable which descends into the depths of the
shaft leading down. This cable appears taut, and is moving
slightly, as if connected to a pendulum. A casual search will
reveal nothing else. A careful search (throw 9+; OM +
number of persons searching) will reveal two things. First,
that there is a small kicker at the pendulum connection ; it
occasionally supplies force to keep the pendulum swinging.
Second, a concealed passage (location 13) becomes obvious.
An individual with navigation skill will note that the center
of this chamber is at the exact center of the large pyramid.
The knobby cable may be a method of descending into
the depths of the shaft. It would require a leap to the cable
(throw dexterity or less to succeed; OM + vacc suit skill,
OM -3 if vacc suit skill is 0 or non-existent), followed by a
slow descent (throw strength or less to succeed; OM + vacc
suit skill and+ endurance, OM -4 if vacc suit skill is zero or
non-existent). Perform the descent throw three times (for
high, moderate, and low heights). If any throw is unsuccessful,
the individual falls, and will suffer 20 h its
applied randomly in one lump (perhaps producing unconsciousness).
and a further 20 applied in 10 units. In addition,
vacc suit integrity may be broken (throw 10+; OM -
vacc suit skill), which will result in instant death.
Ascending the cable follows a reverse procedure, but
requires an automatic OM of -2 on each throw to cover the
added strain of moving up the cable, and then leaping from
an unstable position.
Referee's Note: At this point, the band may decide to
split up rather than risk all their lives in a descent. The
portion which remains behind should stay in chamber 9 in
order to avoid the divided band penalties for both groups
(as specified on page 134).
10. Large Chamber. Large chambers have no doors. This
large chamber is empty, and has a cross-section as shown in
diagram 2. The central sunken area is filled with vapor.
Casual search will reveal nothing; careful search (throw 10+
for success; OM +8 if anyone has infrared goggles) will show
that the walls of the chamber are painted in a striking mural
visible only in infrared. It is possible to detect the mural
(but not view its content) on close inspection in visible
light.
The mural shows a perception of the area around the
pyramid complex, with a low range of mountains in the
background. Most apparent, however, is the vast throng of
reptilian-looking creatures (about human size) crowding
around the complex. They appear intelligent and civilized,
perhaps congregated for a religious or political purpose.

The Traveller Book
Specific details of these beings are not especially obvious to
the observer.
11. Large Chamber. large chambers have no doors. This
chamber is similar to location 10, and should be administered
like it. However, the mural in this chamber is a depiction
of several of the alien creatures engaged in throwing
snake-like small animals into the open shaft on the platform
outside the complex. Careful search (throw 9+; OM +3 if
more than two persons are involved) will show that the
fluid in the central depression in the chamber is populated
with snakes like those shown on the mural. An individual
approaching adjacent t'o the lip of the depression may
provoke the snakes (die roll 2 on the animal encounter table)
to attack, even if they have not been discovered by search.
The fluid in the depression will vaporize if subjected to
great heat; specifically, if an energy weapon is fired at the
pool, its contents will vaporize after three shots. It will
immediately begin refilling from the drain pipe, but several
skeletons (of crawlers, flyers, and the intelligent aliens) will
be visible at the bottom.
12. large Chamber. large chambers have no doors. This
chamber is similar to location 10, and should be adminis·
tered like it. However, the mural in this chamber shows a
large flock of flying creatures (recognizable as flyers, page
139) soaring and diving around the complex. Flashes of
energy are shooting from the faces of the large pyramid,
incinerating individual flyers. No other animals or beings
are visible in the representation. Careful search (throw 9+;
OM +3 if mechanical skill is present) will show that the
represented energy blasts can hit any location within sight
of the pyramid, but cannot hit locations which are occluded
by the smaller pyramids. By deduction, it would appear
possible for the ship to take off without danger from the
energy beam, if it first moves until occluded by one of the
smaller pyramids, and then lifts off so as to remain shadowed
by that smaller pyramid.
13. Concealed Passage. This doorway is revealed only by
careful search of chamber 9. The panel concealing the
doorway will open to combined strength characteristics of
13+. When opened, there is a chance (throw 7+) that a
flock of flyers (die roll 7 on the animal encounter table)
are concealed behind it, and will erupt in an attack. Each
individual in location 9 would be forced to fight (three
combat rounds) before retreating to the safety of another
chamber or passage. Anyone adjacent to the central shaft in
location 9 should throw once (throw twice dexterity or
less) to avoid falling into the shaft. If a fall does occur,
throw dexterity or less to grab hold of the pendulum cable.
See location 9 for falling resolution.
The passage from 13 leads on a slant down to the power
plant level.
DEEP lEVEl lOCATIONS (14-24)
The following locations are situated on the deep level
map (14 is on diagram 1).
14. Fracture Point in the shaft connecting location 1
and location 15. This lip on the shaft is a result of seismic
activity. An individual stopping here will find several small
snake skeletons. Throw twice dexterity or less to avoid
slipping and falling; OM + vacc suit skill. Careful search
Shadows
(throw 10+) will show a single gold coin engraved with a
symbol of a flame.
15. large Central Chamber. The floor of the chamber is
flat, with no central depression. It is littered with snake
skeletons. Large quantities of vapor are wafting from
location 17, and cascades of vapor are drifting down from
above. Careful search (throw 1 0+; OM + medical skill) will
show that many of the skeletons are reasonably recent, but
that the carcasses decay or degrade rapidly in the corrosive
atmosphere. In addition, the skeletons are concentrated
toward locations 16 and 18; very few are near 17.
16. Small Chamber. Throw 9+ for the door to be open.
This chamber is identical to location 2, and should be
administered like it.
17. large Chamber. Large chambers have no doors. The
entrance way to this chamber is highly charged; any individ·
ual moving through it and touching any surface will set off
an electric charge which will inflict 40 hits on him or her.
This effect can be avoided by leaping the d istance (3
meters ; throw strength or less), or by crawling through the
vent pipe overhead.
The interior of this chamber is quite cold; much of it is
filled with vapor, obscuring vision. The central depression is
filled with frozen gas, forming a hard surface. However,
more than three persons on the surface will cause it to
break, dropping all into the cold fluid beneath. Throw dexterity
or less to escape without falling in; throw dexterity
or less (OM - vacc suit skill) to avoid 1 D hits from the fall.
Careful search of this chamber should be promoted by
the fact that the walls have a mural (in visible light) of the
exterior landscape of the complex. However, even careful
search will reveal nothing else.
18. large Chamber. large chambers have no doors. This
chamber is completely empty, even to the point of the
central depression being empty and dry, and the walls being
completely featureless. Careful search will reveal nothing.
19. Small Chamber. Throw 9+ for the door to be open.
This small chamber is empty. Careful search will reveal
nothing.
20. Small Chamber. Throw 9+ for the door to be open.
This chamber is unusual in that it is accessed by a long dark
small corridor. The chamber itself has a caved-in ceiling;
shards of ceiling material have dropped down, and soil or
stone has formed a pile on the floor. Careful search (throw
10+; OM +1 for each electric torch or cold light involved)
will reveal the skeleton of one of the aliens, with only rags
left from his clothes, and a small fiber pouch in the heap of
soil; its contents include a set of 37 gold coins (a 38th coin
is at location 14), and a knife of obviously alien manufacture.
Any individual with education 9+ will see that the
ceiling will probably cave in completely with the next
seismic tremor. Throw 6+ on each succeeding tremor until
it does cave in.
21 . large Central Chamber. Suspended in the center of
this chamber is a large (one meter diameter) pendulum
weight at the end of a knobby cable. Inscribed on the floor
of the chamber is a complicated pattern which the pen·
dulum weight follows. Careful search (throw 7+; OM +
electronic skill) will show that the pattern is inscribed on
movable panels which can be displaced. Beneath the panels
137

138
Shadows
are a series of eight pie-shaped compartments. Numbers 1,
2, 4, 5, and 7 are empty. Number 3 contains a set of twelve
grippies: small clamp-tools of strange form and design.
Intelligence of B+ will see that they can be used to create
foot- and hand-holds on the knobby cable; climbing up
with them will avoid the negative OMs on the throws given
in location 9. Number 6 is connected to the drain pipes,
and contains a flock of crawlers which will attack when exposed.
Number 8 contains a flat metal fragment; intelli·
gence of 9+ will deduce that it is a key which will open
or close any doors to chambers.
22. Large Chamber. Large chambers have no doors. This
chamber is obviously a control room when the adventurers
enter it. The walls of the chamber are covered with a large
array of bar dials; each begins at floor level and ascends to
the center of the ceiling. Changes in color along the length
indicate intensity or value. Careful search (throw 9+; OM
+1 per person with education above 9) will show that the
instruments and controls are divided into three basic groups
wh ich can be numbered from 1 to 100 (arbitrarily and for
convenience).
Group One (numbered 1 to 33) consists of instruments
with fluctuating readings, probably power plant related.
Group Two (numbered 34 to 66) exhibits constant
readings, with most showing some low degree of value, and
numbers 53 and 56 reading (anomalously) at zero. Add 33
to the location number to determine which gauge/control
refers to which lighting fixture. Numbers 65 and 66 refer to
corridor lighting.
Group Three (numbered 67 to 100) consists of instruments
which are reading very low values, except for 99,
which reads at a very high intensity. Gauge 99 reflects
power consumption for the detectors which govern the
energy beam.
Experimentation may be called for by the adventurers.
Below each gauge is a set of three depressions. The top one
will turn on a device or circuit; the bottom one will turn off
a device or circuit. However, as a safety device, neither will
work unless a f inger is also inserted into the central depression
simultaneously. Assume that this trick will not be
Game Designers' Workshop
chanced upon until at least a half hour of careful search has
passed (throw 11+ to succeed; OM +1 per ten minutes total
time spent searching) .
If all power plant controls are turned to zero, all power
(lighting, power plant, defenses) will go to zero, and nothing
can be restarted. If control 69 is activated, a subsonic
signal will panic all animals within the complex. Control 74
will turn off the pendulum kicker. Control 83 will turn off
the defenses of location 17. Controls 69 and 84 come on
automatically approximately two minutes before a seismic
tremor occurs.
23. Large Chamber. Large chambers do not have doors.
This location is quite similar to location 22, but the interior
lights do not work, and all of the controls and gauges read
zero. An atmosphere tester with a serial number in the
4000 range will emit a beep, and the green and amber lights
will come on, although the air remains unbreathable in this
chamber.
24. Large Chamber. Large chambers do not have doors,
and this chamber has no central depression; instead, its
center has a raised dais of stone with the appearance of
having been rubbed smooth from long use.
POWER PLANT LEVEL LOCATIONS (25-32)
The following locations are on the interior level map:
25. Passage. Entered from location 13, this long sloping
corridor leads downward toward the interior of the small
adjacent pyramid. The floor is littered with dust, dirt, and
animal droppings.
26. Power Plant Chamber. Large pieces of machinery
occupy most of this chamber. The complexity of this
equ ipment makes it difficult and dangerous to disable this
power plant. Should it be attempted, the individual(s)
involved in the effort must select a seemingly important
looking item, and cut or destroy it. Throw 12+ (OM +
electronic or mechanical skill ) to succeed. If not successful
by the second try (ten minutes per try), the frequency of
seismic tremors will increase.
27. Fuel Chamber. This large area is f illed with vapor to
a depth of perhaps a meter. Careful search (throw 9+) will
show feed lines leading from the tank to location 26.
Cutting these lines, however, will not affect the power
plant.
28. Vent Chamber. This unused chamber apparently
serves for overflow of power plant exhausts, although this is
not currently happening. An individual with intelligence B+
will see that this chamber is utilized only if the power
plant is in overload status.
29. Surge Chamber. This small chamber is empty, and
appears to be part of the power plant vent system.
30. Surge Chamber. This small chamber is similar to
location 29. At the back of the chamber is a vertical shaft
to which are attached several vanes or blades near the floor.
The vanes occasionally turn in response to air currents.
31. Surge Chamber. This small chamber is similar to
location 29.
32. Access Points. Two barred entry points are situated
at the bottom of the shaft which pierces the platform
outside the pyramid complex. The bars can be removed
with a laser weapon or with a cutting torch.

ANIMAL ENCOUNTERS
The interior of the pyramid complex is infested with a
large number of animals, all of which have lived and bred
within its walls for hundreds of years. They inhabit the
airshafts, the drainage vents, the small spaces beneath the
magnetic flooring, and other likely areas such as the pools
in large chambers. Three basic types of animals are present:
flying hunters, chasers, and amphibian grazers. All are
rather small (none larger than 12 kilograms) and not
especially smart. However, all run in packs, and their
numbers can endanger adventurers if they do attack.
ENCOUNTERS
Each time the adventuring band enters a new area, the
referee should throw randomly to determine if they have
encountered a group of animals. Thus, there is a continuing
chance that the characters will come upon animals which
will obstruct them in their searches. Throw 8+ for an
animal encounter to occur; OM +2 if the pyramid's interior
lights are out locally when the throw is made. Make the
throw whenever the band moves from one location to
another, including when moving just into a corridor.
If a band is split, throw separately for each group whenever
one of them enters a new area. If an encounter occurs,
consult the animal encounter table below.
Surprise: Assume the adventurers have surprise (they
surely will be alert to begin with) for the first encounter on
this table. Thereafter, roll for surprise using the instructions
from the chapter on personal combat. Assume that animals
with surprise will attack.
Priority: Specific animal encounters occur in locations
11 and 13, and override use of the animal encounter table.
THE ANIMALS
The three animal types encountered appear to be dis·
tinct (though related) species; upon examination of specimens
(a character must examine at least one specimen of
each type during the adventure, and throw education minus
S or less at the end of the adventure) they are discovered
to be developmental stages in the life of a single animal.
The amphibian grazer form hatches from eggs laid in the
pools of fluid. The juveniles spend most of their time
swimming, but venture out at intervals to feed upon the
Shadows
plant and fungal material growing in the small chambers.
After an unknown period of growth (from the 3cm hatching
length to the full size of 7S to 100 em) the juvenile
locates a protected place in which to enter a period of
suspended animation, during which it metamorphoses
into one of the two adult forms, either the four-legged male
or the larger winged female. At irregular intervals throughout
the year, the two sexes return to the pools from which
they hatched, where they produce large quantities of eggs.
The adults are carnivorous, and feed on the juvenile form.
The young are covered with a thick scaly skin which
serves to protect them from the ravages of the insidious
atmosphere. The juvenile, unlike the adult life forms, is
toothless, but is equipped with a number of serrated
structures along the edges of the mouth to aid in biting off
sections of the f ibrous plant material upon which the
juveniles feed.
The male reaches a maximum size of about 40 em,
weighing from 3 to 6 kg. Like the juveniles, the males are
covered with scales, but in mature forms, these are finer
and covered with a thin, tough outer layer of skin.
Females are usually about 60 em in length, with a
wingspan of 100 to 120 em. They typically weigh from 6 to
12 kg. The wings are formed from thin outer skin stretched
over a f ramework of thin bones, in a manner similar to the
Macropan screamer-in-the-darkness or the [[Terra|Terran]] bat. This
form, like the male, feeds on the juvenile, making this
organism the only known case of an animal feeding solely
off its own young.
SEISMIC TREMORS
Throw two dice for the strength of a tremor : any
individual with a dexterity less than the throw is shaken to
the floor or ground by the force of the quake. Throw
endu ranee or less to avoid 1 0 bruises from the fall; OM +
vacc suit skill and brawling skill. Throw 11+ to lose vacc
suit integrity; OM - vacc suit skill.
Frequency: Quakes occur on the encounter t able. Before
such a quake occurs, the predictors (location 21) will
activate. Tampering with the power plant (location 26) will
increase the frequency of the tremors to one per ten
minutes, with each becoming stronger (OM +1 to the throw
for each new quake strength).

REFEREE'S NOTES
This structure is de~ iberately presented as a puzzle which
must be investigated and understood by the player characters.
The referee, however, should know more about the
background and details of the pyramid; as the players
investigate, they may be able to deduce some of the information
presented here. If they appear close, then the
referee can reveal certain bits of information.
The pyramid structure on Yorbund was constructed
perhaps 50,000 years ago by a minor al ien race originating
far to coreward. Voluntary exiles from their own civilization
(coming this far in sublight speed ships equipped with
low berths), they selected this world as the site of their
noble experiment in esthetic simplistics. The group seeded
this region of Yorbund with their food animals and settled
into a simple life of contemplation in natural surroundings.
The world, to them, is a paradise without need for labor or
effort. The only reminder of their extraplanetary origins is
the pyramid structure, which they created as a central
esthetic rallying point. The aliens congregated here at
regular intervals for rituals and group interaction.
The Alien Creatures: The aliens themselves appear
vaguely reptilian, derived from quadrupedal carnivore
stock; now standing upright, they retain their thick tails
for balance, which incidentally frees a three-fingered hand
with twin opposable thumbs for such tasks as grasping.
The insidious atmosphere in which these creatures exist
has greatly influenced their lives, customs, and habitat.
Living things within this environment are engaged in a
constant struggle against its corrosive effects; many different
mechanisms have evolved in various life forms, such as
impervious sl ime coatings, constantly replaced outer
skins, or surface enzyme reactions. When any local creature
dies, the animal immediately becomes prey to the local
atmosphere, and dissolves into greasy smoke in a matter
of minutes. As a consequence, food must be eaten live,
on the spot. Naturallv enough, meals have never become
a social function.
Within the pyramid, a series of breeding chambers (locations
2, 4, 6, and 8) serve to constantly produce small
animals which then roam free within the structure, serving
as food to the al iens when they feel the need. A hungry
alien simply grabs one (from under the platform or from
the air) and eats it, selecting the particular taste he prefers
by animal type and size. With food animals roaming free,
safety devices are installed on all controls which prevent an
animal from accidentally triggering them. Location 16 has
an electrical barrier which prevents access to the room by
non-flying animals. Controls in the control rooms (locations
22 and 23) have complex three-holed operating switches
which include an integral safety aspect.
Meals are not social functions, but the need for social
interaction must still be filled. In the evolutionary devel opment
of these aliens, they found sunning themselves
on warm rocks to be a suitable situation for discourse and
social interaction. For the aliens who operated the pyramids,
location 24 was a social center; the aliens sunned
themselves on the raised stone dais created for that purpose.
The Energy Beam: The alien crew of this structure was
charged with the operation and maintenance of the pyra-
Game Designers' Workshop
mid as a central symbol for the population which lived
outside. The aliens outside lead a simple life in the wilds,
eating the many food animals which abound in the local
terrain, interacting with others, and pursuing their own
philosophical views of esthetic simplistics. The pyramid
complex is a central esthetic symbol; the crew is charged
with insuring that it remain esthetic. The function of the
energy beam (shown in the mural at location 12) is to keep
flying creatures away from its surface; their excrement left
while they perch on it would detract from its appearance.
At one time, an elevator platform operated in the
vertical shaft leading from 1 to 15 (below the statue atop
the pyramid). Seismic activity on Yorbund has resulted in
a shifting of some structural walls; the fracture at location
14 has made the elevator inoperable. Safety interlocks have
since made the elevator almost indetectable, and adventurers
will probably not discover it.
The various skeletons scattered about the interior of the
structure show the ongoing interior ecology, as animals die,
or are eaten, and their components are dissolved by the air.
Skeletons are also destroyed by the atmosphere, but at
a slower rate than flesh.
Seismic Activity: The aliens have a great deal of interest
in seismic activity, which is relatively frequent here. Predictors
are installed in the control rooms (locations 22 and
23). and the pendulum which swings in location 21 is
responsive to seismic activity.
The Situation Today: This colony failed many years ago.
The aliens outside have died off and the food animals
seeded outside have dispersed; the area has proven unable
to support the numbers of aliens expected. All that remains
today is the pyramid complex and the animals within,
supported through the years by the power plant which
continues to operate.
These food animals, originally docile, have regressed
from their meek roles to wilder, more aggressive types, and
as such they now pose some danger to the adventurers.
The area outside the structure may present additional
challenges or interests to the adventurers. Some members of
the original colony may still survive, although in what form
is not certain. Some may retain their philosophical civilization,
or they may have regressed to savagery. The original
colony ship is almost certainly disintegrated by the local
atmosphere by now. And any outside investigation would
have to take into account the effects of insidious atmosphere
on vacuum suits.

Exit Visa
This short adventure, entitled Exit Visa, is a complete adventure for Traveller. It concerns the exploits of the crew of a
free trader on the world Alell. It is assumed that this adventure will be administered by a referee who has read
through it completely, and who is familiar with it and with the rules of Traveller. All rules necessary for this short adventure
are contained in this book. Other materials which may prove necessary include note paper, graph paper, pencils or pens, and
six-sided dice.
For Referees Only: This entire adventure is for the reference of the Traveller referee. Players should not be allowed to
read any part of it until they have finished the adventure.
STANDARDS AND ASSUMPTIONS
The following standards and assumptions are used in the
text of this adventure.
Current Date: 300-1105
Dates: All dates in this adventure correspond to the
Imperial calendar, which uses consecutively numbered days
within a 365-day year, and consecutively numbered years
beginning with year zero - the founding year of the Imperium.
The initial date for this situation is 300-1105;
300 is the current day (the 300th day) of the 1105th year
of the Imperium. Once the adventure begins, time should
flow normally. If necessary, change the date to match a
local situation or campaign.
Location: Alell, Regina Subsector, Spinward Marches
Location: This adventure takes place on the world of
Alell (0106-B46789C-A), in the Regina subsector of the
Spinward Marches of the Imperium. Alell is 6,400 kilometers
in diameter, with a standard atmosphere and approximately
70% of its surface covered with oceans of
water. Alell has a population numbering 203 million as
of the census of 1100. Its government is an impersonal
bureaucracy. The world, when first colonized, was under
the authoritarian rule of the colonization ship captain, and
h is descendents have continued to rule under the title
Captain. The government, responsible to this Captain,
provides many necessary functions, but these functions
seem to be performed more for the overall good of the
world (and the government) than for the individual citizens.
The law level on Alell is extremely restrictive and no
weapons of any sort are allowed in the possession of
individuals. Alell's tech level is A, about average for the
interstellar community.
Starport: Alell Down Starport is classified as type B,
providing good quality fac ilities, with some capacity for
ship repair and the construction of interplanetary craft. A
Travellers' Aid Society hotel and office is located just
outside the starport boundary. Refined fuel is available at
Cr500 per ton; unrefined fuel is available at Cr100 per ton.
Alell Down's companion facilities, Alell Orbital Starport,
provide services, refueling, and maintenance for unstreamlined
ships calling on the world.
CHARACTERS
Any group of characters may set out on this particular
adventure. For best results, the group should include
certain skills and a ship.
Ship: This adventure centers on the crew of a ship
which has been denied an exit visa from Alell. The group
must have a ship, preferably a free trader. If they do
not have a ship, the referee may direct the situation by
providing a patron: the captain of a free trader who needs a
crew. Once the crew has served for several jumps, the
situation on Alell can be presented.
Skills: Skills of probable value during this adventure
include administration, streetwise, bribery, forgery, and any
other non-violent skills which can convince others to act on
the characters' behalf.
Weapon skills will be of only minimal value because of
Alell's high law level.
Transport skills may prove useful in the event that the
group needs to undertake a journey of any sort.
Equipment: The group is equipped with whatever
items they may have bought prior to arriving on Alell.
While on Alell, the adventurers may wish to buy other
equipment which may become available in the situations
they encounter.
In addition, the group's ship should have the contents of
the ship's locker shown below (although the referee may
indicate that it also contains other equipment).
SHIP'S LOCKER
eight vacc suits, each with oxygen tanks for eight hours
and short range communicators
four shotguns, each with ten loaded magazines
two automatic pistols, each with ten loaded magazines
four cutlasses, each with a belt scabbard
one lock pick kit
eight sets of cloth armor
one pair of image-intensifier goggles
one radiation detector
one grav belt
one long range communicator
No other equipment is available at the moment, but
items consistent with Alell (tech level A or less, and not
restricted by law level C) may become available to the
characters as the adventure proceeds.

Exit Visa
FREE TRADER BEOWULF
If the adventurers have been hired on as crew for a
free trader, the following description of the ship should be
made available. In other situations, the referee may wish
to use details of the ship in describing that situation.
The Beowulf is a type A free trader, 200 tons, and
approximately thirty years old. It has ten staterooms
and twenty low berths. Cargo capacity is 82 tons. The ship
is streamlined, and can refuel by skimming gas from gas
giants or drawing water from planetary oceans. Armament
for the ship consists of one triple turret with a heterogeneous
mix: one missile, one beam laser, and one sandcaster.
A second hardpoint on the hull is plated over;
some day, the captain hopes to acquire a second turret and
weaponry.
Expenses: Expenses for this sort of ship are high. The
monthly bank payment is Cr155,000. Life support (assuming
two trips per month) runs Cr24,000; fuel costs are
Cr30,000 per trip (refined fuel), or Cr6,000 per trip (unrefined
fuel) . Minimum crew salaries come to Cr18,000.
Berthing costs are on top of that. Approximate total costs
for the ship per month run Cr200,000. Actual costs depend
on usage rates and number of trips made.
Revenues: The ship (assuming two trips per month).
can produce an approximate maximum income of
Cr282,000. Because ship usage is rarely at maximum,
average income is somewhat less.
THE SITUATION AT ALELL DOWN STARPORT
The ship has just landed on Alell, and is discharging
a chartered cargo as well as passengers. The captain will
receive Cr80,000 when the cargo is signed over in a few
hours.
The adventure begins with the presentation of the
situation. The group, in its preparations, should be aware
that they are on Alell, unloading cargo, and probably
looking for new cargo. Procedures from the chapter on
trade and commerce, as well as passenger and cargo availability,
should serve to fill these needs.
After about a day on the world, a port official calls
Game Designers' Workshop
the ship and asks that the captain report to the port warden's
office as soon as convenient. Roll for reaction by the
port warden when the captain arrives to determine attitudes
and the method of conducting the meeting. The message
will, however, be the same. A seemingly minor irregularity
in the ship's papers has been discovered and as a consequence,
the port warden is revoking the ship's exit visa. The
ship will be forced to remain at Alell until the matter is
cleared up.
If the port warden is reacting positively to the captain,
he should confide that the problem is minor, and really
just a matter of paperwork, and that it should be resolved
within a few days, a week at most.
The captain, will of course, see the matter differently.
Even assuming that he can fill his cargo hold and staterooms,
he has to leave within six days in order to earn his
fees, or he risks being late with his next ship payment. If he
misses that payment, he could lose his ship.
The Irregularity: As soon as possible, the captain will
take the group into his confidence and discuss the probable
nature of the irregularity that is causing the problem. Some
months ago, his ship was involved in a smuggling operation.
He undertook the job because he needed cash. And he
almost got caught. In the rush to escape capture, he left a
landing field while enforcers were approaching the ship, and
he thinks that certainly one or more of them were killed.
That incident took place parsecs from here, and his ship
was properly disguised to avoid proper identification.
Nevertheless, if they are checking into that incident,
they could find him out. He would lose the ship, and
possibly his life. It is essential that they leave Alell before
the investigation turns anything up.
Besides, the authorities will probably assume that the
present crew was part of the incident, and hold them as
well.
OPTIONS AVAILABLE
The oppressive law level of Alell makes many of the
usual options (such as a running gun-battle as the ship lifts
off) impossible. Alell will not tolerate that sort of behavior,
and most likely everyone would be killed if they tried that.
Instead, subtlety and discretion are called for.
The crew has one major course of action available: to
persuade someone to grant an exit visa to the ship and her
crew. That requires finding the right official and doing
whatever is necessary to convince him or her to grant the
right papers.
During the course of the search, it is possible that the
crew could find out where to steal the right papers, or discover
their format so that they could be forged, but the
major emphasis must be on dealing with the bureaucracy.
TIME SPANS
The ship needs to leave within six days. Within that
time, the crew must secure an exit visa. Nevertheless, time
should pass in a reasonable manner.
Each day should consist of four periods: morning, afternoon,
evening, and night. No meetings are allowed at night;
everyone should be sleeping at that time. One meeting with
an official is allowed per other period. Entertainment of

The Traveller Book
officials is allowed only in the evening.
Sleep: The crew must sleep one period in four. Generally
this will be at night. In some circumstances (such as the
crew sneaking out or burglarizing offices at night) sleep
must be taken in the period before night. Initially, efforts
will be slow, but between one and three officials can be
talked to per day. Specific details concerning which of·
ficials can be met and when are discussed in the sections
on meeting officials.
Permission to Leave: On the fifth day, begin rolling for
official granting of an exit visa. Throw the day number or
less for the port warden to call the ship and say that the
exit visa has been restored. For example, on the f ifth
day, throw 5- for the exit visa to be granted; on the seventh
day, throw 7- for the visa to be granted. On the seventh
day and thereafter, if the exit visa is not granted officially,
the referee should produce an announcement that it is
expected on the following day.
THE BUREAUCRACY ON ALELL
As the crew of the ship struggles to find a way off-planet
before their time runs out, they will meet all manner of
bureaucrats performing their roles within the government
of Alell. These bureaucrats are the key to the crew's safety.
Within the morass of different departments is the possi bility
that one of these officials can provide an exit visa.
Thirty-four distinct officials are presented. Each listing
shows an official number (just to help keep track of them
all ). a description of the official's position, a bribery price
for the official, a note on the skills which may help in
dealing with him or her, and an indication of what that
official can do for the crew.
The referee should use these officials to present a
challenge to the group; each listing is a framework on
which an encounter may be built. Once the official is carefully
enticed into helping, the group finds out the precise
nature of that help and can proceed to the next official.
Reactions: The referee should roll on the reactions table
to determine the official's response to the crew's approach.
That roll is also the official's throw (or less) to perform
whatever he or she is capable of for the crew. Thus, if an
official's reaction roll is 7 (non-committal) then the crew
must roll 7- on two dice to entice that individual to help.
Bribery: As indicated in the definition of bribery skill,
bribery may be used to convince an individual to help. The
individual listing shows his or her price for a bribe. If that
price is paid, then bribery skill may be used as a minus DM
on the throw to convince (which is helpful). Reaction rolls
of less than 7 are considered negative, and bribes offered to
individuals in those circumstances will be rejected. On any
rejected bribe offer, roll 3- to see if the offer is then
reported to higher authorities.
The amounts shown for the bribes are minimums and are
to be used as guides. A character, when contemplating a
bribe, should be allowed to arrive at his or her own suggested
amount. If that is too low, then the referee may
suggest that it is insufficient. If it is too high by more than
approximately Cr100, then the referee may suggest that it
is more than enough.
Other Skills: Administration and streetwise may be used
Exit Visa
as skills to assist in getting an official to help. If the skill is
mentioned in the official's listing, then it can be used
as a DM. However, only one person may use such a skill
while dealing with the official. Thus, the most capable
individual should step forward to deal with the bureaucrat.
Some skills are listed as double. A listing of double
administration indicates that each level of administration
skill applied to the situation counts as two.
Entertainment: The group may decide to try entertaining
an official, taking him or her out to dinner, plying
the official with drinks and a good time, all in an attempt
to prompt a positive, helpful reaction. If entertainment is a
possible method of influencing an official, then the word
entertainment (followed by a price) appears. That price
must be paid by the crew for the official and for each
member of the crew engaged in the festivities. The number
of crewmembers taking part in the entertainment is the DM
allowed on the throw for the official to help. If the official
is not amenable to entertainment, then any offer made will
be politely (or not so politely, depending on reaction
throws) declined.
Ingenuity: During the course of the encounters, players
may come up with ingenious ideas for meeting officials,
influencing them, or hurrying the course of events along.
The referee has a responsibility to respond to such suggestions
and to allow those which make sense. For example, a
player character whose prior career was the navy might be
given an advantage when dealing with the Alell Navy Port
Defense Squadron executive officer (official number 27),
and an even greater advantage if the player character is a
former naval officer, perhaps forcing an appointment later
in the same day instead of on the next day. A character
with computer skill could check the local computer banks
for information on an official, perhaps learning a clue to
the approach most likely to gain a positive reaction. A character
with streetwise might be able to force an appointment
for earlier than would otherwise be granted. The referee
should encourage ingenuity on the part of the players, but
such attempts should always be kept reasonable and should
be based on the characteristics, skills, and experience of the
characters.
THE FIRST ENCOUNTER
The group automatically meets official number 0. He is a
clerk who can be bribed for Cr10, and who can be influenced
by entertainment and admin skill. He can refer the
crew to a customs supervisor (official number 17) who
might be able to help.
0. Clerk in the port warden's office. Cr10. Entertainment
(Cr10), administration. Refers crew to customs
supervisor (official number 17).
The encounter might proceed in the following manner:
official number O's initial reaction roll is 6, unreceptive.
The characters cannot expect a lot from this clerk, but
decide to try for something. The characters could elect to
entertain him or to use administration skill. Offering to
bribe a negatively reacting character would be ill-advised.
To entertain, one character could invite the clerk out for
143

144
Exit Visa
drinks later that evening (and the clerk would accept on 6-,
his initial reaction throw or less). If the invitation were
accepted, then the character would have to pay Cr20 (Cr10
for each of them). For each additional character accompan·
ying the party, the cost would be Cr10 more.
Ultimately, the crew would have to roll 6- for the clerk
to refer them to someone who might help. A OM of minus
the number of adventurers accompanying the official for
the evening is allowed. If three crewmembers came along,
the OM would be -3, for a throw of 9- for success. If the
roll succeeds, they are referred to a customs supervisor
(official number 17).
Because entertainment must take place in the evening,
there may not be time for each official to be entertained.
Instead, some other applicable skill may be brought into
play. Because this official is influenced by administration,
some character with admin skill may make the appeal.
Admin skill appl ied is used as a OM on the throw for
success. If the character has admin-2. then the throw
for success is 6-, OM -2, for a final throw of 8- for success.
MEETING OFFICIALS
Once per day, the group will randomly encounter an
official who has potential for helping. Only one such
official can be met randomly per day, regardless of whether
the group splits up or remains together. If the group splits
up, then roll to determine which individual character
actually meets a potentially helpful official. To determine
which official has been randomly encountered. roll two
dice. Allow a +OM of either the highest administration skill
level present, or the highest streetwise skill level present.
The resulting number is the number of the official encount·
ered. If this official has already been encountered, there is
no random encounter.
Randomly encountered officials may refer the crew to
other officials, as may those other officials. Officials to
whom the crew are referred may be met with on the day
following the day of referral. If, on the first day, official
number 0 refers the crew to official number 17, then the
crew may meet with official number 17 on the second day.
Game Designers' Workshop
Subsequent Encounters: While the crew can find only
one new official randomly per day, previously encountered
officials may provide references that enable the crew to
seek out other officials. It is possible to meet with two
referred officials per day in addition to the one randomly
encountered official.
For example, on the first day, the crew rolls 4 (OM +2
for highest streetwise in the group) and meets an admin·
istrative clerk in the Department of Registration (official
number 6). They convince this clerk to help, and he refers
them to the supervisor in the Department of Registration
(official number 13). On the next day, the crew rolls a 5
(OM +2 for highest streetwise in the group) and encounters
the local Commemorative Society membership supervisor
(official number 7). The crew may meet with both the ran·
domly encountered official number 7 and the referred to
official number 13.
Multiple Encounters: The referee should note those
officials who have been encountered. Once an official
has been encountered, further encounters will have no
result. That is to say, the crew has only one chance with
each official. Future meetings will not produce additional
referrals.
The Capital: Lucifer, the capital of Alell, lies some
1,200 kilometers north of Alell Down Starport. Not all
bureaucrats perform their duties near the starport; those
officials numbered 25 and higher have offices in Lucifer.
Travel by monorail from the starport to Lucifer takes
about six hours: in effect, a character riding the monorail
must spend all morning, all afternoon, all evening, or
all night doing so. Monorail passage costs Cr80 per person
one way, and Cr150 per person round trip.
THE OFFICIALS
The following list of 33 officials includes individuals
from all levels of the bureaucracy on Alell. Only officials
numbered 2 through 12 (or higher as allowed by OMs based
on streetwise or administration skill) can be encountered
randomly. Such encounters are assumed to occur as the
crew visits various government offices in search of assist·
ance. Other officials can be encountered only if referred to
by a previously encountered official.
1. Clerk in the port warden's office. Cr50. Admin·
istration. Refers crew to clerk in the starship regulation
office (official number 10).
2. Clerk in the immigration office. Cr75. Administra·
tion. streetwise. Refers crew to chairman of the Commem·
orative Society Committee for Non·Residents (official
number 19).
3. Starport security enforcer. Not bribable. Streetwise.
Entertainment (Cr10). Refers crew to starport security
supervisor (official number 18).
4. Customs inspector. Cr100. Administration, street·
wise. Refers crew to clerk in the port warden's office (of·
ficial number 1 ).
5. Customs inspector. Cr 1 00. Streetwise. Refers crew to

ADMINISTERING THE OFFICIALS
The referee has an opportunity to use the brief descrip·
tions of the officials to provide interesting situations for
the Traveller players in this adventure. The following is
an example of a strictly by-the-rules, but nevertheless
wrong, way to handle an encounter.
"You have just met official number 0, a clerk in the port
warden's office. I have rolled for his reaction, and he reacts
unreceptively - that's a six. Admin will affect him. So who
wants to talk to him?"
One character speaks up, "I will; I have Admin-4."
"OK, roll to see if he'll help."
He says, "I need 10-, right? The clerk's reaction roll,
minus a OM of -4 for my admin skill?"
" Right."
"I rolled a 5. What's the clerk say?"
"He says you can talk to the customs inspector (official
number 4), who might help."
"Right. Let's go."
Now for an idea of the right way to handle the same
situation.
"As you leave the port warden's office, a clerk at the
counter catches your eye." At this point, roll for his
reaction to the crew. Its a 6, unreceptive, but he still
looks like he might be able to help. Since the players
don't know what skills might come into play, allow the
entire group to approach, but single out one player in the
crew to talk; he might not have the best skill level for the
145

146
Exit Visa
task, but he should have some appropriate skill level.
"OK, I'm trying to engage the man in conversation,"
says one character.
" He'll talk, but seems brusque." Encourage the players
to figure out the procedure themselves. "He seems kind of
officious."
"Maybe we could slip him some cash?" interjects a
character with bribery skill.
"Do you want to try that?" let the character make the
decision while giving enough data to allow a reasonable
response. One without bribery skill should be rebuffed,
while one with skill might be told, "He's not acting friendly
enough to be bribable at the moment."
If necessary, push the players to ask the official if he
can help. Note, if necessary, who does the asking, and
use that player's skills to modify the die roll. Roll the dice
secretly, but let the players know they are being rolled.
The result is 5, with enough OMs to allow the clerk to
give some help. The referee should say, "The clerk thinks
maybe you should make an appointment to see the customs
inspector in Building 134 tomorrow. He might be able
to help."
CRIME
There is always the possibility that the crew of the
ship might turn to obviously illegal means to achieve an
exit visa. The temptation could surely be extra strong after
meeting the secretary to the administrator, Department of
Registration (official number 16). who has a supply of
blank exit visas in his office safe. In such a case, the group
could decide to try to burglarize the safe some night.
Burglary: Attempts at burglary will have to take place at
night, which means that the would-be burglars need to
sleep early, and need to gather up any required equipment
for the job. If this option is selected, the referee will have
to provide floorplans for the office and building to be
broken into, as well as any other details.
Bribery: Graft and corruption are parts of life on Alell,
and the punishment for bribery (or attempted bribery)
is rather light: a Cr100 fine. However, getting caught
at attempted bribery is a social blunder, and further at·
tempts at bribery by a character are subject to a OM of
+1 (which tends to make bribery less possible).
Curfew: The high law level on Ale II ( 12) is very restric·
tive. No outside activity is allowed without special permits
during night. Throw 12+ to avoid being stopped by an
enforcer for curfew violation during night. Starship crews
can often plead important commercial necessity and evade
any citation by an enforcer on 8+. If the policeman insists,
the group is subject to an evening at the pol ice station and a
Cr50 fine each.
Police Encounten: Each day, the group (or each indi·
vidual in the group) is subject to a throw of 12+ to avoid
being routinely stopped by an enforcer to determine
the legitimacy of his or her activity. These throws may
be avoided if the group is being scrupulously careful in
its business; if not, then there is a chance of police en·
counter. Note that 12+ means automatic harassment once
per day.
Weapons: Carrying any weapons when questioned by
Game Designers' Workshop
an enforcer is grounds for immediate arrest, confiscation
of the weapons, and a jail term of up to 1 D days.
THE COMMEMORATIVE SOCIETY
Most of the titles for the officials available make sense
and can be readily understood. The titles that make less
immediate sense are those associated with the Commemor·
ative Society. The following background should prove
useful to the referee.
The Society: Annually, the government sponsors a
week-long celebration of the initial settlement of Alel l.
During those seven days, work comes to a stand-still, and
citizens can spend their time commemorating the estab·
lishment of this society in which they live. There are
parades, parties, vacations, all manner of enjoyable diver·
sions. The Commemorative Society is responsible for
organizing the celebration. It has the power to tax any
citizen one week's labor (in kind, in money, or in goods at
wholesale) in order to support the activity. Some citizens,
such as entertainers and servants, actually contribute their
time during the week of celebration. Government officials
are exempt from service, although some are taxed to
provide their normal duties and are given time off later.
local chapters of the Commemorative Society stage
local celebration ceremonies; the central chapter of the
Society produces the lavish celebration in the capital.
Memben: About 5% of the population has joined
the Commemorative Society. Members contribute their
labor in the continuing organization of the celebration.
Members probably contribute more time and labor than
the general population. The Captain (Aiell's head of government)
generally judges the quality of the Commemorative
Society members by the quality of the celebration. A good
celebration will bring recognition to the Society's many
members; this recognition translates into pol itical power
with the government's impersonal bureaucracy. Many
of the Society's members are individuals who need to deal
with the government, and use their positions within the
Society to help them.
REFEREE'S CHECKLIST
In administering this adventure, this checklist may help
the referee provide a consistent situation to the players.
1. Day One.
A. Indicate initial situation.
B. Allow encounter with official number 0.
C. Allow random encounter with official.
D. Schedule next day's appointments with referred-to
officials.
2. Subsequent Days.
A. Allow random encounter with official.
B. Keep appointments with referred-to officials.
C. Schedule next day's appointments with referred-to
officials.
WHERE TO FROM HERE?
Success or failure in acquiring an exit visa ends this
adventure. Ideally, the group succeeds, and goes on to the
next world. Failure calls for the referee to administer the
situation according to the events. Bon Voyage!

Traveller's Guide to the Universe
An infinity of Traveller universes are possible. In one, no life exists but what is [[Terra|Terran]]-derived; in another, no life ever
gains ascendance over more than its own star system. Countless other possibilities are available to the fertile imagination.
In order to more completely describe events and possibilities in Traveller, one universe has been selected and more
fully explored. This universe provides a large-scale consistent background against which any number of situations and
scenarios can be set. It is futuristic enough to provide science fiction adventure, but it is also similar enough to the world we
know that it seems logical and comprehensible even to a player who does not have access to all of the background material.
Information about this universe (which centers upon the Imperium - a large star-spanning empire over a thousand years
old) is presented in the form of essays and maps. It is recommended that every dedicated player read this chapter in order to
have a background on what is going on.
Library Data: The chapter on library data presents information which is less familiar. Unlike these basic background
essays, library data is provided to the players only when the referee thinks proper.
THE IMPERIUM
The key to the stars is the jump drive - without it, the
space between the stars takes years, even lifetimes, to cross.
With it starships travel parsec distances in a matter of
weeks. The development of a jump drive marks the beginning
of interstellar travel for any race, including humaniti.
A jump drive is both fast and simple. With one, it is
possible to move from here to there (where both places are
at least one hundred planetary diameters out from any large
masses) in a period of about a week. The t ime in transit is
independent of the distance travelled, which makes this
system practical for interstellar travel, but for little else.
The distance travelled with the jump drive is a function of
the specific jump drive in use - for varying sizes and complexities
of jump drives, the performance ranges from one
to six parsecs, with greater distances as yet unavailable. In
point of fact, the current theory of jump drive actually
precludes greater jump distances.
Another central fact of interstellar travel is the fact that
no method of information transfer faster than jump drive
has been discovered. Ships can carry messages, but radio
still lags at mere light speed. Communication is always
restricted to the speed of interstellar transportation.
For Terra, the first rudimentary jump drives came into
general use in the mid-21st century. These drives introduced
the [[Terra|Terran]]s to Alpha Centauri, the farther stars, to the
First Imperium (then called only the Imperium). and to the
First Interstellar War, 2113 AD. That series of wars (there
was, of course, more than one) hastened the fall of the
Imperium, and resulted in the takeover of the existing
structure by expanding [[Terra|Terran]] forces. Their rule (The Rule
of Man, or the Ramshackle Empire, depending on who
wrote the history) slowed, but did not stop, the continuing
decay of empire.
What followed is romantically called the Long Night. It
wasn't romantic at all. The fall of the empire halted much
of the trade and commerce between worlds- many of these
worlds simply died, no longer able to maintain their previous
standard and unable to recapture the lower technology
levels necessary for survival. Some worlds banded
together in pocket empires, mere shadows of the former
glory that was the First Imperium. Some worlds wasted
their technological jewels fighting for the scraps of the
empire that were left. The fighting and the turmoil lasted
nearly two hundred and fifty years - from twilight to
maybe nine o'clock. Some worlds didn't even know for sure
that the empire had fallen; communications ships simply
stopped coming, and no one could find out why.
Night continued for another twelve hundred years.
Worlds turned in on themselves, developing local resources
and moving in their own directions. About three decades
before dawn, a group of worlds known as the Sylean
Federation established a firm industrial base and a strong
interstellar government. Th is, coupled with a high population
pressure, provided the impetus necessary for the
re-establishment of the empire. In a thirty-year campaign,
the Sylean Federation actively recruited new member
worlds for its interstellar community. Public relations
programs, active commercial warfare, and (where necessary)
battle fleets joined to bring all of what is now the Capital
Sector under one rule. Proclaiming the Year Zero a holiday
year to mark the beginning of a new era, Cleon accepted
the iridium crown of the Third Imperium, establishing
it firmly on the foundations of the First and Second.

Traveller's Guide to the Universe
THE STRUCTURE OF THE IMPERIUM
The Imperium is a far-flung interstellar community
encompassing over 1100 worlds within a region approximately
700 parsecs across. It has now ruled its territory for
eleven centuries and looks to continue for many more.
Interstellar government over such a large area, however,
becomes a philosophical question; the problem initially
seeming to be insurmountable. Distance, travel time, and
communication lag all conspire against a functioning,
efficient structure which can meet the needs of its subject
population. But the lessons of history serve as a guide.
Spain in the 16th century ruled much of the New World,
with travel times of about a year between the seat of
government and the new territories. In fact, through most
of history, timely governmental communication, with both
a rapid dispatch of instructions and an equally rapid response,
has been a dream, not a reality.
The Imperium has come upon two solutions which
together ameliorate the problems of distance: the xboat
network and feudalism.
The Xboat Network: Like the body, with its network of
veins and arteries, the Imperium is permeated by a network
of xboat routes, or links, devoted entirely to the carriage of
messages for official, commercial, and private purposes.
The express boat (xboat) is a small, fast ship filled with a
pilot compartment, message data banks, and jump drives.
The fit is so tight that the tiny ships don't even have
maneuver drives. Each is capable of jump-4 (four parsecs in
a week); it jumps, relays its messages to the station on
arrival, and then waits to be picked up by a tender, refueled,
and sent on its way to the next station on the
route. The local station on a world accepts messages,
encodes them, and transmits them to a station at the edge
of the stellar system. The network works like the pony
express - with messages always moving at top speed.
Transfer time for the messages from one xboat to another
can be as short as ten minutes, and is rarely more than an
hour.
Ultimately, the little xboats make their way to one of
the many Imperial way stations scattered throughout the
Game Designers' Workshop
Imperium's subsectors. There they are refitted, overhauled,
and refurbished, only to be sent on their way again.
The xboat network makes the edge of the Imperium
about 44 weeks out from the core and capital; that represents
a savings of better than 50% of normal travel time.
And still the Imperium is straining under the effects of
distance.
Feudalism: With such great distances separating stellar
systems, individual responsibility and authority become of
great importance. The Imperium is divided into sectors
(twenty of them), each about 32 parsecs by 40 parsecs in
size. Each sector is divided into sixteen subsectors (8 by 10
parsecs). And within a subsector are perhaps thirty or forty
systems, each with a star, worlds, and satellites.
Individual worlds, and even entire systems, are free to
govern themselves as they desire, provided that ultimate
power is always accorded the Imperium. Interstellar govern·
ment begins at the subsector level - on one world designated
the subsector capital. The ruling figure at the sub·
sector capital is a high-ranking noble selected by higher
levels of government. This duke has a free hand in government,
and is subject only to broad guidelines from his
superiors. But at the same time, the duke owes fealty to the
higher levels of government, ultimately to the Emperor
himself. The feudal approach depends greatly on a sense of
honor, one cultivated by the hereditary aristocracy. This
sense of honor is very strong within the Imperium; it has
proven essential to the survival of this far-flung interstellar
community.
THE MEGACORPORATIONS
Millions of organizations do business within and without
the Imperium. Most of them are limited to a town or
province; some reach as far as one or two worlds. A few
thousand trade over one or more subsectors; a few hundred
cover one or more sectors. Only a few firms are truly
Imperial in scope: the megacorporations. Staggering in size,
these organizations are so large that no one person can
know everything they are concerned with at any given
moment. Total shares of stock, annual profits, number of
employees are all astronomical. In many cases, the organizations
are so large that different divisions of the same
megacorporation may actually be working at cross purposes.
For example, a local branch of Ling-Standard Prod·
ucts may need an important industrial process currently
being developed by a local company. The branch manager
has it within his power to negotiate purchase of that
process, and if negotiations fall through, to use industrial
espionage to steal the formula. What he does not know, and
probably cannot know, is that the local company is owned,
through a long, tortuous series of holdings, by LingStandard
Products.
Most megacorporations are organized very much like
smaller companies. They have a board of directors, a
president, and many vice presidents. On this level of power,
however, the board and the higher-level executive officers
are largely out of contact with the day-to-day (and even the
year-to-year) functioning of the company. These upperlevel
echelons plan general policy and long-range actions.
The most important executives, in terms of personal power,

The Traveller Book
are the various regional managers. The term region is imprecise,
but usually refers to an area covering one or more
sectors. A regional manager may control only a small por·
tion of the megacorporation's assets, but can hold more
power than representatives of the Imperial government.
A small number of Imperial regulatory agencies have
power over megacorporations, and the companies are
subject to local and Imperial taxes. But, provided the
company does not blatantly violate Imperial sovereignty,
regional managers can usually conduct their business as
they see fit. Because a direct confrontation with the lm·
perium would be bad for business, intentional violation of
Imperial law occurs only on a covert basis.
Titles: Except for those companies predating the lm·
perium, all corporations engaged in interstellar commerce
within the Imperium's borders are required to possess an
Imperial charter. Such a charter is indicated by the abbreviation
LIC (for Limited liability Imperial Charter) fol·
lowing the company name. Occasionally, corporations
make use of archaic titles, such as the [[Terra|Terran]] ltd, Inc, Amt,
AG, and SA. This form is used to indicate that the com·
pany predates the Third Imperium (rarely the case) or to
add charm and quaintness to the title.
A few Vilani megacorporations are still in business under
their Vilani titles. The names, at least, date back to the
First Imperium, and were the names of the Imperial organi·
zations, half industrial trusts, half government bureaus,
which controlled commerce under the Vilani Imperium.
Ownership: Corporations belong to their shareholders.
An individual shareholder usually owns a pitifully small
proportion of the company; the main value of stock is
the dividends that it pays and its cash value if sold. In·
dividuals or companies which hold large blocks of stock
(more than 5%) hold more than money: they hold power as
well.
It is traditional for any megacorporation to place some
of its stock in the hands of the Imperial family and various
subordinate noble families. Rarely is the placement con·
sidered a bribe; nobles serve on the board of directors of
many megacorporations, and are consultants to many more.
The Imperial family's great wealth initially derived from
a commercial empire, and the promotion of trade and
commerce has remained a major emphasis of Imperial
government.
THE SPINWARD MARCHES
A major mapping division of interstellar territory is the
sector. Each consists of sixteen subsectors arranged in
a rectangle four across and four high. For reference, these
sixteen subsectors are lettered from A to P, as shown in
the diagram.
Interstellar directions within the galaxy are expressed
with respect to its shape and rotation. Toward the core, the
term is coreward; toward the rim and intergalactic space,
rimward. In the direction opposite to galactic rotation,
trailing; and in the direction of galactic spin, spinward.
These direction conventions provide the name for a frontier
of the Imperium: the Spinward Marches.

WITHIN A SECTOR
Marches represent one of the furthest extents of explora·
tion and domination by Imperial forces.
Up until the formation of the Third Imperium, the
Spinward Marches were only sparsely settled, primarily by
the Sword Worlds and the Darrian Confederation. By 100,
the first Imperial surveys had been completed in this region,
and by 200, major inroads into settling the Marches had
been made. By 300, the Imperium had incorporated the
sector into itself.
This is not to say that the Spinward Marches is totally
settled, or totally tame. The sector is only partially incor·
porated into the Imperium, with the Sword Worlds, the
Darrian Confederation, and scattered other areas main·
taining their independence. Many worlds remain unsettled
or unexploited; the entire sector is, and will be for years to
come, a frontier.
Vital Statistics: The Spinward Marches consists of 432
systems with a total population of 388.2 billion. There are
ten asteroid belts and many amber- or red-<:oded zones. The
Imperial border winds its way through the sector, separa·
ting the Imperium from various client-states, undeveloped
areas, and rivals.
The subsectors of the Spinward Marches are very diverse;
they feature extremes of high and low tech level, popula·
tion, and industrial development within a few parsecs of
each other. Great opportunities exist for enterprising
individuals and companies.
Subsector Names: The sixteen subsectors (with capitals
listed in parentheses) in the Spinward marches are:
A Chronor (Chronor), B Jewell (Jewell). C Regina
(Regina), D Aramis (Aramis). E Ouerion (Ouerion). F Vilis

Regina Subsector
The Regina subsector is a diverse, developing subsector on the very fringes of the Imperium. The Imperial frontier
runs along its coreward edge and portions of its spinward edge. Its major xboat routes connect it with Jewell subsector
to spinward and with Lanth subsector to rimward, providing major trade channels which roughly parallel the Spinward
Main, a well-used natural jump-1 trade route.
Although virtually all of the worlds in the subsector are settled, there also remain vast areas with potential for exploration
and exploitation, and this frontier subsector is full of opportunity for the entrepreneur.

library Data
library data entries represent information available from any ship's computer using the library program, in response
to the correct keywords. The information may be desirable as background or supporting information for an adventure,
as data to help players better understand the situations they are in, or as leads to help start new adventures. In general,
the referee can look into library data any time the player characters indicate that they are researching a subject. In addition
to directly relevant information, additional materials of interest may be revealed to them.
LIBRARY DATA ENTRIES
The following entries comprise library data.
Algine (0708 X766977-4): Red Zone. Interdicted by the
Scout Service in order to protect its developing technological
culture.
Astrography: The science of mapping interstellar space.
Basic to any science of mapping is a coordinate system. The
system used by the Imperium is based on rings of longitude,
rays of latitude, and parsecs. Rays of latitude extend from
the galactic core, while concentric rings of longitude are
placed at one parsec intervals. By convention, the concentric
ring passing through Reference/[[Capital]] is labeled
the 10,000th ring, and is used as a baseline. Similarly, the
ray of latitude extending from the center of the Galaxy
through Reference/[[Capital]] is designated as the first ray.
Measurement is in parsecs, counting in the trailing direction.
Computation reveals that the circumference of the
10,000th ring (r=10,000) is 62,832 parsecs. Counting
spinward uses a subtraction from 62,833, which is the
equivalent of the zero baseline.
For example, Regina, of the Regina Subsector, in the
Spinward Marches, is 9930 ring/ray 62723. The format for
expression of location is xxxx ring/ray yyyyy, where xxxx
is the ring of longitude (distance from the galactic core in
parsecs), and yyyyy is the distance of the ray of latitude (in
parsecs) from the first ray of latitude, measured along the
ring of longitude in the trailing direction.
This mapping system is highly Imperio-centric, and other
systems are used outside the Imperium. This system has
gained wide acceptance, however, among Imperium dominated
client-states, human and otherwise. This mapping
system breaks down and is prone to error beyond certain
limits. It does serve admirably for a band approximately
400 parsecs wide at a longitude of 10,000 parsecs.
[[Capital]] ([[Core sector]]  0508 A586A98-F): Central world
of the Imperium and $eat of government since its founding.
Situated in the center of the Imperium, [[Capital]]'s astrographical
position has proven of prime importance, as a
communications hub, a cultural center, afld an industrial
focus.
Civil War (604 to 622): Fought between various factions
within the Imperium for control of the bureaucracy. It had
its origin in the strain on communications within the
Imperium caused by the long lag times dictated by the very
size of the Imperium. To cite one cause, however, would be
simplistic. The diverse backgrounds of the many constituents
of the Imperium had its effects, as did rivalry for
power by major naval and military commanders, and a
lessening in the Imperium's expansionist tendencies.
The spark which started the Civil War was thrown off by
the First Frontier War (589 to 604) in the Spinward
Marches. Communications lags and a lack of preparedness
forced the Marches to conduct most of the war on its own,
with little additional help or support from the Imperium.
After Grand Admiral of the Marches Olav hault-Piankwell
forced the war to an end, he found solid support for a new
government. Marching on the [[Capital]] with his war fleet, he
forced an audience with Empress Jacqueline I, supposedly
for recognition of his war effort. In the course of the
meeting (in 606) he personally murdered the Empress, then
proclaimed himself Emperor by right of fleet control. The
ensuing power struggle lasted through eighteen years and
eighteen emperors.
Client State: An independent political unit which has
elected (or had forced upon it) the patronage of a larger
political unit. This relationship is generally mutually
beneficial, and is essentially commercial in nature. That is,
the political or defensive ties which may be part of any
patron-client relationship are ultimately intended to promote
trade between the two.
Confederation: Group of independent states, worlds, or
systems united for specified purposes, while generally
retaining more freedom of action than the members of a
federation. League. Alliance (especially of princes, nations,
states, worlds, or systems).
Directions, Galactic: Conventions which have achieved
widespread acceptance when referring to direction. Toward
the galactic core is coreward; away from it, in the direction
of the rim, is rimward. In the direction in which the galaxy
is rotating is spinward, while the other direction is trailing.
These directions are in widespread use in describing
Imperial features and businesses. For example, the Spinward
Marches is a sector at the extreme spinward fringe of
the Imperium; Rimward lines is an important interstellar
transport company.
Finally, within the Imperium, the term coreward is also
used to indicate the direction of Capital, the Imperial core.
There is some potential for confusion if the term is accep·
ted out of context.
Dating Systems: Three major dating systems are in use
when referring to historical events: [[Terra|Terran]], Vilani, and
Imperial.
[[Terra|Terran]] dates center on a year about midway through the
period of Vilani ascendance. After that date, years ascend,

The Traveller Book
and are suffixed AD; before that date, years descend, and
are suffixed BC. There is no year zero. [[Terra|Terran]] years have
365 days and are considered a standard for length of year.
Years are further subdivided into months and weeks,
although these divisions have fallen into disuse outside the
Solomani Sphere.
Vilani dates count from the year of the establishment
of the First (or Vilani) Imperium. Those before are suffixed
PI (pre-Imperium), those after are suffixed VI (Vilani
Imperium). There is no year zero. Vilani years are approxi·
mately 1.33 standard years in length. Vilani years are
further divided into seasons, months, and weeks.
Imperial dates count from the year of the founding of
the Third Imperium, specifying the year zero as a holiday
year. Dates before that are negative; dates after that are
positive, with the sign usually suppressed. Imperial dating
uses a julian system for specifying days. Each day in the
year is consecutively numbered beginning with 001. Thus,
in the year 1105, the first day of the year is 001·1105.
Weeks of seven days and months of 28 days are used to
refer to lengths of time, but rarely to establish dates.
Efate (0105 A646930·D): Spinward connection in the
vital express boat route leading to Jewell subsector. Recent·
ly the site of continuing bitter anti· Imperial guerrilla
activity.
Empire: Group of independent states, nations, worlds,
or systems under the supreme rule of an emperor.
Express Boats: The primary means of interstellar communication
is the physical transport of messages by a
jump-capable ship. Within the Imperium, the method is
called the express boat system. Small, fast, information
carrying ships are specially constructed to make large jumps
and carry data for retransmission. Outlying worlds of the
Imperium stand nearly four years from the capital, and
express boat links have been established to insure the rapid
transmission of messages (governmental, commercial, and
private) with a maximum of efficiency.
Selected locations along major trade routes are estab·
lished as express stations; as orbital facilities which service
and refuel xboats on their communications runs. As an
xboat arrives in a system, it beams its recorded messages to
the express station, which then retransmits them to an
xboat standing by for a jump outsystem. Time between
jumps is almost always less than four hours, and can be
under seven minutes. The speed of communication is thus
nearly the speed of jump (xboats are equipped with jump,4
drives, four parsecs per week). In practice, this speed is
somewhat reduced as trade routes do not follow straight
lines, and not all jumps are made at jump·4. Average speed
approximates jump-2.6 per week.
Festival: Annual celebration staged on the world of
Rethe (0808 E230AA8·8). Originally a reaction to the
restrictive government considered necessary for survival on
Rethe, the three day holiday period has continued as a
carefree celebration where citizens release the tension that
has built up during the preceding year. All laws are suspen·
ded (local law level becomes 0) during the festivities. Some
abuses have always been present, but the population has
resisted any effort to change the conditions of their favorite
holiday.
Library Data
The Travellers' Aid Society classifies Rethe as an amber
zone during the period of Festival.
Federation: Group of states, worlds, or systems, each
internally independent, joined into a union to which has
been surrendered certain rights and responsibilities, most
generally to do with foreign affairs.
First Imperium (-4045 to -2219): The f irst major
interstellar civilization, politically and culturally dominated
by humans originating on VIand. The jump drive was
discovered on VIand in -9235. Immediately the Vilani
discovered a number of interfertile and technologically
primitive human races on worlds within 60 parsecs. These
were gradually brought to a high-technology state with
Vilani help, and assimilated into a loose interstellar com·
munity bound by trade and common culture. Eventually,
the client races themselves explored beyond the local
sphere, contacting and trading with still more races. These
new races gained their technology without being assimilated
into Vilani culture; the resulting cultural friction even·
tually precipitated a series of wars, beginning about -5400.
In response to the threat, VIand began tightening its control
of its trade sphere, finally organizing it into a centralized
state in -5273. This marked the beginning of the First
Imperium, although there was as yet no emperor. During
the thousand year period of the Consolidation Wars, VIand
conquered and absorbed its enemies until there were no
longer any civilized states on its borders (except for a
portion of the Vargr Extents, isolated from the Imperium
by the Great Rift). The last war ended in -4045, and Vilani
dating begins at this point. With no exterior threats, the Pax
Vilanica lasted for nearly 1200 years; at its height, attained
soon after the end of the wars, the First Imperium contained
27 sectors and over 15,000 worlds. However, the
cost of maintaining centralized control over this vast
expanse was cultural rigidity; exploration had ceased with
the beginning of the wars; now scientific research slowed to
a halt, and the beginnings of a hereditary caste system
began to emerge. Civilization was in decline. As long as
there was no exterior threat, the Imperium was safe; but
gradually, despite all efforts, technology leaked across the
borders. New interstellar states arose, and the Imperium
could no longer afford to absorb them. Gradually, the
Imperium lost territory along its coreward and trailing
marches. Then, in -2422, the Imperium was contacted
along its rimward border by the [[Terra|Terran]]s, recently emerged
into space. [[Terra|Terran]] expansionism led to a series of inter·
stellar wars, ultimately resulting in [[Terra|Terran]] conquest of the
Imperium in -2219 and the founding of the Rule of Man.
The First Imperium bore many names in its long life,
including the Grand Imperium of Stars, the Grand lm·
perium, and the Vilani Empire.
Forboldn (0208 E893614·4): Primary colonization
project within the Regina subsector. Originally conceived in
987 to utilize the resources of Forboldn, the project began
its execution phase in 1089. Large numbers of colonists
were recruited and shipped in cold sleep from the Imperial
core, with arrival times set from 1110 to 1120. Simul·
taneous preparations on Forboldn began, with detailed
planetary surveys to pinpoint resources and initial building
projects to prepare industry and quarters for the arrival of
153

154
Library Data
colonists.
An interesting aspect of such colonization projects is the
recruitment methods used to supply personnel. Since
virtually no amount of money will entice an individual to
leave his home and livelihood for the bleak desolation of a
colony world, the Ministry of Colonization has established
several programs to produce colonists. Most obvious is the
colonize in lieu of prison term program. However, several
other programs have also shown signs of success. In the
unemployment insurance program, high population worlds
have successfully used the colonization project as a means
of reducing unemployment over the long term. In a similar
medical insurance program, indigents unable to obtain
medical treatment are provided with their needs in ex·
change for signing on to a colony. A colony's needs for
skills are met through the anagathics program; qualified
(and aged) individuals can be provided with anagathics to
extend their lifespans in return for their providing such
skills as administration, mechanical and electronic, and
medical. Finally, a land grant program has provided a cadre
of retiring veterans to supplement the new colony's military
and police forces.
Frontier Wars: A series of interstellar wars waged be·
tween the Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate for control
of the Spinward Marches. The four wars (so far) represent
open flares of conflict in a constant struggle for supremacy.
Heya (0802 6687745-5): Rich, agricultural world in the
backwaters of the Regina subsector.
Holiday Year: The year zero in the history of the Third
Imperium, established by Cleon I to commemorate the
establishment of the Imperium. Technically an aspect of
calendar reform, the use of the year zero provides a central
date point for counting years back into the Long Night and
forward into the future of the Imperium. The actual
advantages of a holiday year are slight: centuries begin in
the hundredth numbered year instead of the first numbered
year, and the number of years between any two dates can
be determined by subtraction.
More importantly at the time, the holiday year was used
as part of the public relations campaigns which were
impressing the authority of the Imperium upon local
governments. The minor requirement of changing to the
new calendar was used to determine cooperation by those
governments.
Humaniti (former spelling Humanity): Collective name
for all of the human races, including Solomani, Vilani,
Zhodani, and others. See Humans.
Humans: Intelligent major race dominating the Imperium
and several additional interstellar communities.
Humans stand approximately 1.8 meters in height and
weigh about 100 kilograms. Descended from omnivore
gatherers, humans developed intelligence in response to
shifting climatological factors.
The most unusual aspect of humaniti is the fact that
humans are present on many different worlds and stand at
various levels of development on those worlds. The Solomani
Hypothesis states that Humans evolved on Terra (Sol
subsector) and were scattered to many different worlds for
reasons currently unknown. The result is that many different,
parallel human races exist, and coexist throughout
Game Designers' Workshop
known space.
The three most widespread human races are the Solomani
(humans from Terra), the Vilani (humans from
VIand), and the Zhodani (humans from Zhodane).
Interdiction: The Imperial practice of interdiction of
worlds within the boundaries of the Imperium had long
been a source of contention between liberal and conservative
factions in the government. Interdictions must be
approved by a member of the Imperial family, but generally
such approval is given in response to a request from an
interested service, almost always the Scouts or the Navy.
It is generally held that the Scouts recommend interdiction
to shield a young or sensitive culture from the
interference that trade and commerce will bring. The Navy
is held to be more vindictive in its recommendations, using
interdiction to punish local governments or to hide its own
mistakes.
Interdicted worlds are awarded travel zone red ratings by
the Travellers' Aid Society.
Ling-Standard Products: Originally a mining firm (and
still very active in that field), LSP currently is engaged in
a wide spectrum of activities including the manufacture of
electronic equipment of all sorts, ground and air vehicles,
starships and starship armaments, drive systems, power
systems, computers and software, small arms, and a variety
of consumer goods. Concerned to a small degree with
banking, insurance, and stockbrokerage, LSP maintains
mining and manufacturing facilities throughout the lm·
perium.
Megacorporation: Large scale stock company with
activities spanning the entire Imperium, as contrasted with
most companies which rarely extend their markets beyond
a single sector.
Menorb (0203 C652998-7): Poor world on the fringe of
the Imperium.
Naasirka: Vilani megacorporation of uncertain lineage.
Tradition has it that Naasirka was one of several quasi·
official bureaus within the First Imperium, controlling
under Imperial monopoly large portions of the electronics
and software market. Naasirka is the largest single supplier
of communications equipment to the Scout Service's xboat
branch. Other product lines for the corporation include
small craft, electronics, computers, and anti-grav modules.
Naval Base: Port facility for the support, maintenance,
repair, and refit of naval vessels. Planetary surface facilities
are generally provided for ships of 1,000 tons or less;
orbital facilities handle larger ships.
Oberlindes Lines: Interstellar corporation established in
1084 with a general purpose of trade and commerce. Oberlindes
is one of the major shipping lines within the Regina
subsector, with feeder routes to all major starports. The
company's expansion into neighboring subsectors has
improved star service, but alienated many of the older,
more conservative lines.
Sergei hault-Oberlindes, patriarch and controller of the
line, was awarded a baronial patent, complete with estates
on Feri (Feri/Regina 0405-6384879-6), by direction of the
Emperor in 1101 for his contribution to the economic
recovery in the Marches following the Fourth Frontier War.
Octagon Society: Established in 342, the Octagon

The Traveller Book
Society was the first major distressed spacefarer assistance
operation to appear in the Spinward Marches. The group
thrived on public contributions and some tax revenues for
150 years; it collapsed in the late 400's when scandals
emerged over the quality of shelter construction and the
disposition of certain funds.
Society shelters were generally of an octagonal shape.
Large hostels were established on major worlds, while
smaller weather shelters were placed on frontier or unsettled
worlds. The characteristic octagon shaped buildings
are still visible on various worlds, although none are still in
use as shelters for distressed spacefarers.
The Octagon Society was dissolved in 499 and its assets
were sold at auction.
Pscias (0508 X355423-1) : Red Zone. Interdicted by
the Navy for reasons unknown.
Pyramids: Traditional form of construction for developing
cultures; considered to be the simplest form of
large scale architecture because of its load-bearing strength
and ease of assembly. Tech level 1.
Pyramid structures of all sizes have been believed to
serve as focuses for psionic (or cosmic) power, and are
claimed to sharpen dulled edges, cure diseases, and generally
work miracles.
Pyram ids have been constructed on most worlds where
the local culture has passed through tech level 1. Many
examples remain due to the massive strength of the structure.
Regina (0310 A788899-A): Rich world serving as the
capital for the Regina subsector.
Regina Subsector: Subsector C of the Spinward Marches.
Contains 32 worlds with a total population of 60.1 billion.
Research Station: The scattered worlds of the Imperium
manifest a wide range of technological levels: this diversity
is maintained by the distances between worlds, the high
cost of transportation, and the re lative independence
allowed to worlds within the Imperium.
Nevertheless, the Imperium itself is constantly involved
with research projects at the forefronts of technology.
While some new technology can be purchased from advanced
cultures beyond the Imperial boundaries, such high
technology is expensive, and still requires a solid technological
foundation to allow its usage. Consider: however
useful solid-state chip circuits are, they still require a firm
grounding in electronics, and cannot be used on a large
scale without electronics, individual solid-state chip components,
photo processing, and even crystal culture. It is
vital that the Imperium pass through many stages of technological
development on the way to achievement in higher
tech level areas.
Imperial technological research is performed in two
ways: under contract by corporations, or in established
Imperial Research Stations. The difference is that the
corporate (or privately financed) research is directed at
specific practical uses, while Imperial projects are breaking
new ground on the forefronts of knowledge.
Private RestJarch: On a scale as vast as the Imperium, it
is often cheaper to duplicate research rather than search out
and contract for technology somewhere in the Imperium.
Trade between different worlds often disseminates knowlibrary
Data
ledge and certain technologically advanced items throughout
the community of worlds. If a certain item proves
useful, local companies wi ll try to achieve the same technology,
and soon enter into local manufacture. local
manufacture takes into account local preferences, as well as
providing local employment. It also avoids potential problems
with licensing arrangements.
Imperial RestJarch: The Imperium finances research into
a variety of areas in the forefront of knowledge. Often this
is an attempt to duplicate technology observed or reported
in neighboring cultures and not yet within the ability of
Imperial science. Such research stations are sited in areas
which need the boost to the local economy, or in remote
areas far from the potential disturbance of Imperial politics.
Many different stations may be working in the same region,
and many different areas of knowledge may be under
investigation at one time. In general, one station will be
constructed for one purpose, and continue in that area of
knowledge for its entire span of usefulness. Its size, personnel
roster, power plant capacity, and even visibility profile,
are dependent on its area of investigation.
Imperial research may delve into many areas. Some
examples include black hole research, both large-scale and
mini-black hole investigation, instantaneous transmitter
development (so far proving impossible). advanced gravity
manipulation, genetic manipulation, anti-matter containment,
weaponry research, disintegrator beams, black globe
development, deep planetary core soundings, nova prevention
(and prediction). psychohistory, mass population
behavior prediction, psionics, stable superheavy elements,
deep radar analysis, long-range detection systems, robotics,
artificial intelligence, stasis and time travel, so-called magic,
cryptography, bionics, personal shields, x-ray lasers, and
high temperature superconductors.
Roup (0407 C77 A9A9-6) : Amber Zone. Waterworld
situated on the express boat route from Regina to Efate.
Its population of 3.4 billion is concentrated on the peaks
of a few underwater mountains, the only dry land on the
world. Real food (as opposed to the local concentrates
made from fish) is highly prized by the population.
Rethe (0808 E230AA8-8): Poor, non-agricultural,
desert world. Best known for its annual Festival.
Ruie (0209 C776977-7) : Amber Zone. Balkanized,
industrialized autonomous world just beyond t he Imperial
border. Amber zone classification posted because of antipathy
against the Imperium and Imperials by some nations
on the world.
Rule of Man (-2204 to - 1776): Upon the conquest of
the Vilani Imperium by the [[Terra|Terran]] Confederation, the
[[Terra|Terran]]s moved to establ ish government of the region.
At first, conquered regions came under the administration
of the navy, under martial law. Much use was made of the
existing bureaucracy and former Vilani administrators, with
naval officers in scattered key posts. When the Confede
ration civilian government attempted to transfer
control directly to Earth, the navy refused. From his
headquarters on Dingi r, the commander in chief of the
fleet, Admiral Hiroshi Estigarribia, proclaimed himself
Regent of the Vilani Imperium and Protector of Terra, with
both states now united in the Rule of Man. Nearly all
155

156
Library Data
the fleet instantly sided with him, evidence of his careful
preparation, and the Confederation Secretariat was dis·
solved in a bloodless capitulation. Estigarribia never actual·
ly assumed the crown, but after his death he was succeeded
by his former chief of staff, who was crowned as Hiroshi II.
Estibarribia is therefore known to history as the Emperor
Hiroshi I.
Ultimately, the task of ruling the vast expanses of the
Rule of Man proved impossible. The Rule of Man continued
to exist for four hundred years, constantly trying (and
failing) to stem the decay of the First Imperium's rule.
The Rule of Man is also known as the Second Imperium
or (disparagingly) as the Ramshackle Empire.
Scout Base: Port facility for the support and mainten·
ance of Scout Service vessels.
Second Imperium: See Rule of Man.
Sector: A mapping unit in astrography, equal to sixteen
subsectors (four wide and four deep) . Sectors are broad
measures of area, and are often used for rough represen·
tations of relative size between interstellar empires. Average
density: 480 to 640 worlds.
Sectors are also called marches or regions. The Spin·
ward Marches are an example of a sector.
Shionthy (0706 X000742·8): Red Zone. Asteroid belt
interdicted by Navy because of its extreme danger to
navigation.
Solomani: One of three major human races within
the known galaxy. The term Solomani has several possible
derivations, including men of Sol, the only men, or the
true men.
Solomani Hypothesis: A generally accepted theory that
all Humaniti originated on Terra, and that all other native
human races arise from stock transported there by the
Ancients. The theory explains the large number of inde·
pendent human races within the Imperium without re·
quiring a farfetched concept of "parallel evolution".
Spinward Main: Within the Spinward Marches, a group
of worlds, planets, and systems each within jump-1 of
another. Together, this grouping (called the Spinward Main)
forms a corridor of jump points which allow simple jump-1
ships to travel to 15 of the 16 subsectors within the Spin·
ward Marches, and to 223 of the sector's 431 worlds. The
Spinward Main has a cul-de-sac branch which enters Regina
subsector at Jenghe and extends as far as Efate.
Spinward Marches: Imperial border sector extremely
spinward of [[Capital]]. Currently a frontier area undergoing
exploration and development.
Strephon: Current reigning emperor of the Third lm·
perium. Oldest surviving issue of Paulo Ill. Born 1049,
proclaimed emperor 1071 .
Subsector: A mapping unit in astrography, consisting of
a rectangular area ten parsecs by eight parsecs. Subsectors
are also called districts, provinces, or clusters. Average
density: 30 to 40 worlds.
Third Imperium: Interstellar empire founded by Cleon I
in the holiday year 0.
Tukera lines: Imperium-spanning megacorporation
providing interstellar transport of cargo and passengers.
Tukera concentrates on the established express boat routes,
and provides jump-3 or jump-4 service along the same
Game Designers' Workshop
lines. In some subsectors (especially the older, more established
regions of the Imperium) Tukera has a virtual mono·
poly on long-distance interstellar transport.
Twilight's Peak: legendary or apocryphal story of lost
spacefarers on an unknown world who discovered fantas·
tic structures and devices while surviving a terrifying winter.
Phrased as an epic poem of execrable quality, the story
is most notable only in that it is based on fact - a task
force was lost in the time period specified, and it has not
been recovered or accounted for.
Vilani: One of three major human races within the
known galaxy. Vilani originated on VIand and formed
the First Imperium which dominated interstellar relations
for several thousand years.
Way Station: Express boat repair and maintenance
facility operated by the Scout Service. In some ways
equivalent to naval bases, way stations have a peacetime
mission of refit and overhaul of express boats. In war,
they serve as naval bases.
Yori (0510 C360757-0): Desert world. The site of
Imperial Research Station Beta (one of seven situated in
the Spinward Marches).
Zhodani: One of three major human races within the
known galaxy. Zhodani inhabit the Zhodani Consulate, a
large and growing interstellar empire spinward of the lm·
perium. Clashes and conflicts between the Imperium and
the Zhodani have continued for the last six hundred years.
A major source of conflict with the Zhodani is their
acceptance and practice of psionics; all Zhodani of noble
birth (social standing A or greater) receive psionic training
as a matter of course.

Pre-Generated Characters
Characters are always in demand in Traveller. The players can generate them as they need them: when they begin an
adventure, when the current character dies, or at any other time. The referee, however, has a constant need for non-player
characters as patrons, casual or random encounters, hirelings, thugs or assailants, and so on.
This list of pre-generated characters is intended to fill the referee's requirement for characters (especially patrons) on the
spur of the moment. Each has been generated in accordance with the character generation rules, and is ready for use. They
are numbered consecutively, and the referee may select any specific character that meets the required purpose. The list of
thugs and brigands fulfils the need for easily available but less fully defined characters.

Animal Encounter Tables
Animal encounter tables can be generated for all types of worlds using the rules provided in the chapter on animal en·
counters. Because of the time involved in generating such tables, they must be produced before an adventure session begins
or the group will become hopelessly frustrated waiting for the referee to complete this particular task. The following set
of animal encounter tables have been generated for use with Heya (B68774S-S) and the amber zone scenario on page 129.
These tables each include one event. If the tables are used enough times to warrant additional events, they may be creat·
ed by the referee or chosen from the various events described in Animal Encounters.
Alternate Uses: These tables can be used equally well with any world having a size of S, 6 or 7, and a dense (type 8 or 9)
atmosphere.

The Traveller Series
There is more to Traveller than just The Traveller Book. Beyond the essential rules in this volume, there is a wealth of
additional material for both players and referees. Additional materials for Traveller are categorized as books (containing
rules). supplements (containing background or pre-generated materia l), adventures (containing scenarios and situations). and
games (generally presenting specific situations for two or more players). The Journal of the Travellers' Aid Society is a
quarterly magazine devoted to Traveller, with annual anthologies to keep the best articles in print.
Other hardcover volumes in the Traveller series - some now available, others in the works - include The Traveller
Adventure, The Traveller Starfleets, The Traveller Campaign, and more. Hardcover volumes are a blend of new and previous·
ly published rules, supplements, and adventures.

The Traveller Book, but in three 48-page booklets.
Deluxe Traveller contains the three books of Basic
Traveller, plus Book 0, An Introduction to Traveller; Introductory
Adventure, The Imperial Fringe; and a large map of
the Spinward Marches.
