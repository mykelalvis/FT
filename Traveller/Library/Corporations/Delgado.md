### Delgado

Delgado is the most recent of the Imperial Megacorporations,
founded in 997. It started out as a manufacturer of military hardware
and moved into other industries including mining and refining of
heavy minerals, publishing, antiquities and toys. Delgado is well
known for its work in miniaturization and for its distinctly suspect
employment practices.

Many of Delgado's subsidiaries, notably Delgado Shipping LIC,
operate a twoâ€“tier employment system whereby a small proportion
of employees are given high status and very good salaries while the
rest are more or less blatantly exploited. Entry into the upper echelon
is used as a 'carrot' to string hopefuls along while paying them well
below the going rate. To those who make the jump to Favored
Employee status, Delgado is extremely generous, but there are a
number of contractual 'sticks' which are used to beat troublesome
employees with.



Delgado directly operates numerous mining operations in [[Deneb Sector|Deneb]], along with supporting industries such as ore and chemical refining. Its facilities are typically in heavily industrialised systems, notably asteroid and planetoid belts. Whilst not a player in the dominance games of the sector, Delgado is willing to take advantage of the situation wherever it can, quietly buying out a troubled mining outpost then using its corporate near-invulnerability to turn the fortunes of its new acquisition around. This gambit has backfired a few times but megacorporations can afford to invest where others dare not and Delgardo is exploiting the situation to increase its share of the mining industry in Deneb.
