#### Creating Jonkeereen Travellers
Physically, Jonkeereen are not very different to baseline humans. They were adapted about 400 years ago and have bred true ever since. Tall, lean and dark-skinned, they resemble naturally evolved desert dwellers. Their perspiration system is extremely efficient and they have membranes to protect their eyes from wind-borne sand or dust.

Jonkeereen society varies somewhat across the many worlds where they dwell, however the basic traits are conservatism and cooperation. Their ways are austere and pragmatic in the extreme and this concern with survival can make them seem harsh or even heartless, especially towards outsiders. They are more likely to help others of their own kind than outsiders, if only because fellow Jonkeereen are less likely to get everyone killed by doing something stupid.
