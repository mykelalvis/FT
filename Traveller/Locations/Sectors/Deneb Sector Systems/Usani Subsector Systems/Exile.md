### EXILE

Exile is, as the name suggests, a prison world. It is infamous as 'the prison planet that could not hold Zid Rachele', although there are claims that Rachele actually died on Exile and the tale of his escape was fabricated by his followers.

Being landed on Exile is a life sentence â€“ contrary to certain vid shows, the [[Imperium]] does not send agents to prison planets looking for criminals whose skills it needs. For many, the term of incarceration is short. Most new inmates are given no equipment or outdoor clothing and are murdered for their shoes before they get their bearings. Those who survive normally do so by joining one of the communities of Exile.

Society is rough and harsh but some prisoners have banded together to create a civilization of sorts. This has been a form of rehabilitation for some and since some sort of law is necessary for stability those who intend to live a long life have had to create a functioning society complete with its own justice system. The irony of this is not lost upon Imperial researchers who observe the goings-on of the penal colony with interest.

These researchers are safely aboard navy ships watching the world. The navy takes aggressive action against any unauthorized vessels that approach, although it is probable that the occasional smuggler gets through.  Prisoners have escaped from Exile but always with outside help.

There is a widely held belief that the first prisoners to be incarcerated on Exile were members of the Humbolt family and that they have a secret base there.  There is no substance to this; it is nothing more than a fanciful story that refuses to wither no matter how much evidence is thrown at it. The Humbolts were exiled beyond the [[Imperium]], although it may be that the authorities regret this decision. If they were on Exile at some point, then perhaps the authorities might have some idea where they are now.
