# Stellar Security Services

Stellar Security calls itself a ‘diversified security provider’, a phrase that does a reasonable job of describing its activities. Stellar owns and operates just one starship, the _Patrol Corvette Stalwart_, but has several branches on different worlds providing other services. Stalwart is quite an old ship, bought as surplus from one planetary navy or another and refitted to a good standard. She is in good running order but long in the tooth with some annoying quirks. These do not seem to greatly affect her combat capabilities; Stalwart has engaged pirates and other hostile vessels on several occasions, always giving a good account of herself.

Stalwart is typically hired by merchant lines as an escort or by a world government as a guardship or patrol vessel. She is usually found protecting commerce or installations in systems where piracy is common, but may also hire out as a pirate-hunter or undertake an anti-piracy cruise on a freelance basis. The latter is only viable if bounties can be collected, so the usual method is for Stalwart to team up with an ordinary-seeming merchant ship which gathers information or acts like a tempting target. Pirates attempting to take the prize are counter-attacked, though this can be a risky strategy. The preferred mode of pirate hunting is for the merchant crew to uncover clues to a pirate lair or a vessel that has turned pirate. Stalwart will then hunt down the target and attack by surprise.

Stellar prides itself on being a protector rather than a warmonger. The firm has turned down offers to join a planetary navy for a war or other dispute, and will not even consider taking on a contract to carry out offensive operations against rival shipping. Likewise, the firm’s groundside assets are all about security rather than aggression. Specialists train merchant crews and starport personnel in anti-hijack and similar security procedures, and the firm also hires out shipboard and portside security detachments.

Security detachments are equipped for their role, favouring laser weapons for most applications. Shipboard personnel have armoured vac suits or in some cases combat armour, and are trained in cybersecurity as well as physical responses. Most teams also include a legal expert, who provides a line of defence against attacks using writs and injunctions which can be as damaging as a physical assault under the right circumstances.

Stellar Security Services is widely known for its integrity and strong ‘protector and guardian’ ethic, but it is not a squeaky-clean organisation. Its tactics are distinctly heavy-handed, and mistakes have been made in the past. The firm does not believe in due process, and trains its personnel to react aggressively to a presumed threat. Vessels have been fired upon for navigational errors, and ports flung into lockdown while security teams rampage around looking for imaginary saboteurs. Stellar can rightly claim it has done a considerable amount of damage to pirate and smuggler groups in the region, but the collateral damage has also been significant.
