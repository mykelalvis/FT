# Referee's Overview

The heroes are approached with an offer to return the remains of the patron's friend to a prepared burial plot on his homeworld. Upon reaching the world where the friend had relocated, they slowly discover that he had become a world-renowned figure for using his scientific expertise to help during a disaster. The group is left with the choice of forfeiting the mission (and thus their pay), or angering an entire world.

# Players' Information

Hendrix Zane approaches the heroes with a proposition as they're concluding their business onworld. He explains for many years, he and a college chum, Atticus Sulvan, were the best of friends, only parting when Sulvan moved to the planet Skorane to take on a job in academia.  Recently, Zane has received word of Atticus' passing, and he wants to honor his friend by offering a burial crypt on a large property that he owns outside of the planet's main urban center. He offers the PCs Cr2 5000 to retrieve Atticus' body from Skorane and bring it back to the Hendrix manor for burial. If the heroes don't have a starship of their own, Hendrix issues them round-trip middle passage tickets; the baggage allowances should be more than enough to transport both their luggage and Atticus' coffin.

# Referee's Information

What sounds like an easy milk run should be anything but. It's not going to be as simple as asking the authorities to turn over his coffin and scamper back to Zane's estate.

Atticus Sulvan made quite the name for himself on Skorane; his scientific expertise was instrumental in stopping a pandemic. The grateful populace lionized him to the point he became the local equivalent of canonized. When he died, the planetary government decreed several days of mourning and interred the professor in a sacred crypt on government property. His final resting place has become a shrine and draws many pilgrims every week. Zane knows nothing of this. As far as he knew, his friend was still just a quiet academic. Sulvan didn't mention his newfound fame in his messages, and little of his role in quelling the pandemic was reported in official news communiques.

Upon arrival, the first inkling that anything might be amiss is that one of the starport concourses is named the “Atticus Sulvan Concourse” in Interstellar Common and in Skorani.

The starport personnel directs the team to the official liaison in the planetary capital to begin the process of claiming a body and preparing it for shipment. The trip takes several hours. Along the way, the group might notice such landmarks as “Atticus Sulvan Park”, “Sulvan Tower”, “Sulvan Creek”, etc. this should begin to give the PCs clues that recovering Sulvan's body might be harder than they think.

Upon arrival at the Liaison Office, the adventurers are met with unbelieving laughter when they announce their intention to transport Atticus Sulvan's body back to his homeworld. A sympathetic office worker gives them the brief background above and makes it clear that Sulvan's remains won't be going anywhere. The offworlders are welcome, however, to visit the gravesite like any other visitor.

The site of Sulvan's final resting place should let them know what they're in for: a grand marble mausoleum greets the PCs, with “Atticus Sulvan Memorial Hall” chiseled in the stone above the entrance in Skorani (and smaller underneath in Interstellar Common.) In front of the structure, a large metal sculpture of Sulvan, one hand raised to the sky, the other clutching a stylized human cell, stands on a marble pedestal. (the Referee may replace this with a hologram if (s)he decides Skorane's tech level is high enough.) The mausoleum isn't open to visitors every day; it's open when the PCs arrive on a throw of 7+ and on alternating days thereafter.

On the days it's open, a steady stream of visitors and mourners goes in and out of the building. A set of stone steps rises 7 meters to the entrances.

There are two guards immediately present, with two more on duty; one sweeps the grounds periodically while one monitors the property from a glassed-in booth (see below.) The type of guards present depend on Skorane's government: if the world's Government code is 5 or less, the guards are uniformed, but armed only with non-lethal weaponry and employed primarily as crowd control. If the Government code is 6 to A (10), the guards are discreetly armed and armored. If the code is B (11) or more, the guards are openly armed and armored, and deal harshly with infractions. After hours, a single guard watches over the tomb from a small glassed-in booth. This guard also makes rounds on the mausoleum's perimeter at irregular intervals. Day or night if there's trouble the guards can't handle, they can call for backup from municipal law enforcement, which arrives in 1 D6 minutes.

The adventurers can easily gain access to the shrine along with the other visitors (Cr1 credit is requested as a donation for upkeep.) The interior of the structure is mostly atrial space, soaring to a height of over 7 meters. The walls are lined with memorabilia of Sulvan's life from the time he moved to Skorane. The inner sanctum, where his sarcophagus is, is considered by the Skorani sacred space, with a solemn silence permeating the chamber. Overlooking the sarcophagus is a smaller but exact copy of the statue outside (again, this might be a hologram depending on Skorane's Tech Level. If holograms are present, the sarcophagus has a superimposed image of Sulvan lying in state.) On the opposite wall, several small alcoves hold remains of some of Sulvan's family.

At this point, it's up to the PCs how to proceed. They should be reminded that if they fail to bring back Sulvan's body, Zane won't pay them. On the other hand, liberating the remains might require clandestine, perhaps even illegal actions. While it's likely he'll scrub the entire mission and simply reimburse the team for their trouble thus far, it's also just as likely that his love for his friend causes him to up the price for the team to do whatever it takes to get the body.

Note that if the group decides to conduct an illegality to liberate the body, if caught, the Skorani treats them in a draconian manner, up to and including decreeing the death penalty.
