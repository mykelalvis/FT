# "the mob"

The Tohr Manak is a representation of archaic old-Terran organized crime.  It is a relic of the [[Second Imperium]], where the [[Solomani]] managed to spread through [[Charted Space]] and bring along some of their existing baggage. 

Note that TM is _decidedly NOT_ the _La Cosa Nostra_ from old Terra.  It is what happens when various forms of organized crime  finally merge into a somewhat more organized version of organized crime.
