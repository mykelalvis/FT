[[eneri giilaan.jpeg|Lt. Commander Giilaan]]

Eneri Giilaan is a lieutenant commander in the [[Imperial Navy]], assigned to Naval Intelligence. He suspects that [[Sternmetal Horizons|Sternmetal]] is engaged in something illegal, but has been told by superiors to drop the investigation, ([[Sternmetal Horizons|Sternmetal]] has influence in the government). Giilaan, in patriotic defiance of orders, has been carrying on in secret and in his spare time. He feels that if he can obtain strong evidence, he can force his superiors to proceed. His main area of effort has been an investigation into the movements of Roet [[Bannerji]], whose carelessness has given Giilan a number of clues.
