### Ling Standard Products (LSP)

LSP is mainly active in the mining, industrial and shipbuilding sectors, typically producing mid-range vessels at a reasonable price. LSP has shipyards on a few worlds in Deneb and large mining operations in several systems. A notable concentration exists in Pretoria, which draws LSP into the political arena when Pretoria is threatened by its rivals. In general, LSP has a good relationship with the Duke of Pretoria and has occasionally been loaned a few ducal ships to escort its trans-border trading operations out into the Vargr worlds to coreward.

LSP started out as a mining concern and remains a major player in that field. Its mineral–mining operations have gradually expanded into related fields including asteroid mining, petroleum skimming from gas giant atmospheres, ore processing, bulk transportation and heavy industry.

In addition LSP is now active in the fields of electronics, computers and software, vehicles and high–technology equipment. Its starship components division manufactures mining and prospecting vessels as well as starship weaponry, drives and power systems. LSP also produces a range of simple and easy–to–use power systems and machines aimed at the colonial market, and a cheap but effective range of smallarms that are also popular along the frontiers.

LSP operates a number of major mining installations either directly or as owned subsidiaries. Many of these are located in the outsystem, on moons or in planetoid fields which are claimed (sometimes quite aggressively) as company territory. Its activities are not restricted to Imperial space; LSP is actively sponsoring prospecting missions beyond the Imperial border and is known to own large shares in several extra–Imperial industrial and mining concerns.
