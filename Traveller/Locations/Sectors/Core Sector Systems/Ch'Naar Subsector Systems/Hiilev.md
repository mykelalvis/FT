Hiilev is home to a human Minor Race of sorts but not one seeded there by the Ancients. The Hiidamo are descended from Vilani colonists who came to the world during the early settlement of Ukan (the Vilani name for the [[Core sector]] ). It seems likely that they were genetically engineered to survive the conditions of the planet. They settled the lowlands of Hiilev's richest river valley and developed dark and leathery skin that protects them from exposure to the harsh rays of the system's primary star. The Hiidamo have large, overdeveloped lungs that can extract oxygen from the planet's very thin atmosphere and filter out its sulphur-dioxide taint.

The Hiidamo have a xenophobic culture and did not take well to the arrival of Imperial colonists in 420. The newcomers were more interested in gaining access to the world's rich sea life than encroaching on Hiidamo territory but conflicts between the two groups occurred nonetheless. The colonists had superior technology and some factions among them wanted to commit genocide on the Hiidamo. A colonial militia began to systematically search for and destroy Hiidamo settlements, killing every man, woman and child in several of them. Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed before the natives could be scoured from the planet and the colonists left the remainder alone. The two have learned to live separately in the intervening centuries.
