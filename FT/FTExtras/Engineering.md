Engineering is the [[Fated Travels]] replacement for [[Crafts]].

Most elements of [[Crafts]] apply directly.  However, [[#Engineering]] can also a [[#Profession]] (and one that you don't have to pay for), so it can be a paid position on  starship.

The sub-fields in [[#Engineering]] are
## Mechanic
([[CTSkills#Mechanic|Mechanic]]) (Mechanical repairs on lower-tech vehicles; specifically not for starships or starship systems).

## Engineer
([[CTSkills#Engineer|Engineer]]) (Starships and advanced vehicles).\
Specialties within this field are not considered [[FTSkills#Cross Skilled]] items.  Each stunt can be labeled as a +2 with `TYPE`. 
### Comms
### M-Drive
The repair and maintenance of maneuver drive
### J-Drive
The repair and maintenance of jump drives
### Electronics
The repair and maintenance of electronics other than [[#Comms]], [[#Life Support]], and [[#Power]]
### Life Support
The repair and maintenance of ships life support systems
### Power

The repair and maintenance of ship's power systems, including fuel and fuel scooping.

## Stunts
### Demolitions

Stunt of [[#Mechanic]]
[[CTSkills#Explosives]] - The use of explosives without the near-certainty of self-harm.  It is reasonable to take [[#Demolitions]]  as a base skill without the stunt, but you will not otherwise be a [[#Mechanic]].

Note that a starship engineer is not adept as a general [[#Mechanic]] (_at least_ -2 penalty), and a [[#Mechanic]] _cannot_ operate as a starship [[#Engineer]].
