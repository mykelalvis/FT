[Lir (Da 3202) (world) - Traveller (travellerrpg.com)](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Lir_(Da_3202)_(world))

**Lir** is a world suited to becoming an agricultural world, but with a population between 10,000 and 100,000 sophants, lacks the capability to produce or process sufficient resources to export its projected agricultural produce.

Lir is a member of the [[Apge Run]].

# Native Lifeforms: Virus-Rich Biosphere

Lir is something of a mystery world. Since first discovered by the [[Scout Service|IISS]], it has been quarantined from off-world contact due to the virus-rich atmosphere, which is lethal to humans. Colonization has never been attempted and the only occupants of the system are an [[Scout Service|IISS]] base. The [[Scout Base]] enforces the quarantine and performs research into the atmospheric viruses.

There are a limited range of flora and fauna on the planet, but study has been limited by the need to use remote drones and robots. Few samples have been brought off the planet for fear of viral contamination.
