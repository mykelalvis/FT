TRAVELLER

Tr a v e l l e r is a science fi ction roleplaying game of the far future.
Humanity has gone to the stars and found them crowded with other
forms of life and other sentient races, and science and technology
have advanced vastly over the present day – but the essential
nature of humanity is unchanged. Life continues as it does today,
only spread out over the sea of stars. A mighty Imperium unites
thousands of star systems under a single rule, but it is beset by
enemies both internal and external.

The Imperium commands the space between the stars, ensuring
that civilization endures and trade continues. Megacorporations
and feudal lords conduct the bulk of this trade, but there will always
be a place for the free trader – hardy travellers and adventurers on
the fringes of known space, dealing in strange goods and smuggled
cargoes, doing whatever they can to make a credit.

While the Tr a v e l l e r rules can be used to model almost any science
fiction novel, movie or setting, the traditional setting for games is
the Third Imperium of Mankind, the third great empire to stretch
across the stars. In the Third Imperium setting, the players take
on the roles of tramp merchants and mercenaries, wandering the
galaxy in search of profi t and adventure.

Players
Most of the participants in a Tr a v e l l e r game will be playersplayers. Usually,
each player generates a character using the Character Creation
rules; that character becomes the player's avatar in the game world.
These player characters are the central protagonists of the game
and scenarios revolve around their adventures and actions.

The Referee
One of the participants is the RefereeReferee, who describes the world
around the characters, presents them with challenges and dangers,
and takes on the role of the supporting cast and the antagonists.
The Referee creates the basic outline of the scenarios that the player
characters encounter and resolves the results of their actions using
the rules in this book as a guideline.

Games
Tr a v e l l e r may be played in any of three basic configurations –
scenario, refereed campaign, or shared campaign.

In a scenario, the players embark on a journey or adventure overseen
by a Referee. The Referee determines what dangers the characters
will face, from hostile aliens or criminals to solar fl ares or automated
defence systems, or even political intrigue and deception. The
players choose how their characters will react and overcome these
obstacles. For example, the characters may be hired to bring a cargo
from one world to another, but a rival merchant is trying to stop
them and has hired a band of mercenaries to attack the characters'
ship en route. The characters have to get the cargo through safely.

A scenario can be a one-off game, using characters written by the
Referee specifi cally for that game and discarded afterwards, or it
can be part of a campaign. A scenario takes one or more game
sessions to complete.

A campaign is a series of scenarios, charting the continuing
adventures of a group of player characters. A campaign can be
continuous or episodic. In a continuous campaign, each scenario
follows on almost immediately from the end of the last one and the
fuel, resources and money available to the characters is carefully
tracked. In an episodic game, there are longer gaps between
scenarios, and the game focuses only on the exciting and conflict-
filled parts of the characters' lives.

A campaign can also be refereed or shared. In a refereed campaign,
there is a single Referee for the whole game, who sets up the
whole universe that the player characters adventure in. Refereed
campaigns can have long story arcs and ongoing plotlines, taking
multiple scenarios to resolve. In a shared campaign, the position
of Referee rotates from player to player – for example, when the
characters' ship Jumps to a new star system, a different player takes
over as Referee and presents the dangers and opportunities in
this new system.

### TTRAVELLERRAVELLER

Campaign Ideas
A few suggestions to get the ball rolling:

The Trader Campaign: The Trader Campaign: The player characters form the crew of a
free trader merchant vessel, taking whatever cargos they can get
to keep their spacecraft aloft and in one piece. Inspiration for
games like this could be the TV series Firefly or the computer
games Elite, Privateer, or X.

The Military Campaign:The Military Campaign: The player characters are all members of
a military unit, usually veterans of the same career (see page 8
for more on careers). They participate in campaigns, skirmishes
and other military activity. Inspiration could come from the
Honor Harrington novels, the fi lm Aliens, or Starship Troopers

- the book, the animated series or the fi lm.

The Explorer Campaign:The Explorer Campaign: In a game of this type the player
characters go beyond the borders of known space, looking
for objects, planets and civilizations of value or curiosity. The
characters will have to be highly self-suffi cient to survive away
from known space for long stretches. For inspiration look no
further than the original series of Star Trek.

The Traveller Campaign:The Traveller Campaign: The traditional Tr a v e l l e r campaign
features a little of everything. The characters will go from
exploring abandoned alien ziggurats to rescuing missing pets
to taking on the local crime lord in a protracted gang war.
Inspiration could come from anywhere.

Die Roll Conventions
The Tr a v e l l e r system uses two six-sided dice to resolve most
actions. Some situations involve fewer or more dice. Accordingly,
a quick discussion of various terminology and conventions is
needed before proceeding.

1d6/2d6:1d6/2d6: To avoid writing 'roll two six-sided dice and add them
together' over and over again, Tr a v e l l e r uses the abbreviation 'roll
2d6'. Where you see 'roll 2d6' read 'roll two six-sided dice and add
them together'. Sometimes you may also see '1d6', '3d6' or other
numbers of 'd6'. This simply means roll one six-sided die, three six-
sided dice, or however many six-sided dice are indicated, and add
them together to gain the fi nal result.

d66:d66: This is shorthand for a special way of rolling two six-sided
dice. Before rolling nominate one die as the 'tens' die and one as
the 'units' die, to give you a two-digit number between 11 and 66.
Some numbers cannot be rolled on a d66, giving you a total of
36 possible outcomes.

Check (or Throw): Check (or Throw): To determine if a character succeeds or fails at a
particular task, the player must make a check. To make a check, the
player rolls 2d6 and adds any appropriate Dice Modifiers (such as a
skill his character possesses, or a bonus from a piece of equipment).
If the total is equal to or greater than the target number for that
check, he succeeds. A check will usually have a skill or characteristic
associated with it. For example, a check of 'Dex 8+' means 'roll 2d6,
add your Dexterity Characteristic Modifier, and you succeed if you
have a total result of 8 or more'.

Ta r g e t N u m b e r s : Ta r g e t N u m b e r s : I n m a n y c h e c k s , t h e p l a y e r n e e d s t o r o l l e q u a l t o
or above a specifi c number (usually, eight or more). This is denoted
by a number followed by a plus, such as 8+ or 10+.

Natural 2/Natural 12: Natural 2/Natural 12: Some rolls refer to a 'natural' number – this is
the actual number rolled on the dice before any modifiers are applied.

Dice Modifi er (abbreviated to DM): Dice Modifi er (abbreviated to DM): A number to be applied to a die
roll before it is used. Dice Modifiers are preceded by a sign, which
indicates if the number is to be added to or subtracted from the
roll. For example, a Dice Modifier of –2 indicates that two is to be
subtracted from the roll; a Die Modifi er of +4 indicates that four is
to be added to the roll.

EXAMPLE OF PLAY
Three players (Chris, Tom, and Claire) are playing Tr a v e l l e r. Their
characters are, respectively: Morn, a thuggish ex-barbarian; Erik, a
spy and agent, and Kathya, a pilot and technician. They're currently
aboard their ship, a Free Trader. In-character speech is denoted by
(parentheses).

Referee: Anyway, you've just jumped to the Cogri system. You're
about two million kilometers out –
Chris (Morn): 'Accurate' as usual, Kathya! Only twice as far away as

we should be.
Claire (Kathya): The longer it takes us to get to the starport, the
longer it is before you get us into trouble.
Referee: Ahem. As I was saying, you're about two million k out, and
you're picking up a distress call.
To m : My character will put the distress call on the screen.
Referee: It's audio only. 'This is Free Trader Beowulf, calling anyone...
mayday, mayday, we are under attack... main drive is gone...turret
number one not responding ... mayday...'
Claire: How close is the Beowulf?
Referee: No navigational transponder showing... give me a Sensors
check, please.
Claire: I rolled a 9, plus Dice Modifi ers gives me a 12.
Referee: Yo u ' r e p i c k i n g u p o n e s h i p a b o u t 8 0 , 0 0 0 k a w a y. M i n i m a l
heat, no power, looks dead in space.
To m : No power? Then where's the transmission coming from?
Referee: Er, minimal power then. Power plant's down. The distress
call continues 'Mayday... losing cabin pressure fast...calling anyone...
please help...', then starts repeating itself.
Claire: Life signs?
Referee: Not at this range.
Claire: But I rolled a 12...
To m : Any sign of the attackers?
Referee: Nope.
To m ( E r i k ) : Something isn't right here. Either the Beowulf was hit a
long time ago, in which case someone else should have checked out
the call before us, 'cos we're not that far from the planet... or she
was only hit a short time ago, and the attacker's still nearby. Nothing
on the scope at all?
Referee: Yo u ' r e i n o p e n s p a c e. U n l e s s t h e y ' r e h i d i n g b e h i n d a s p e c k
of space dust...
Claire (Kathya): Nothing. They could have really good stealth
technology.
Chris: Or be hiding on the wreck of the Beowulf...
To m : If it was an internal problem like hijackers, he wouldn't have
mentioned the turret being hit.
To m ( E r i k ) : We've still got to investigate. There could be survivors.
Morn, get to the turret and power up the guns. Kathya, bring us in.
I'll get my vacc suit on and get ready to board.
Referee: As you approach the ship, you see the unmistakable scars
of laser hits, er, scarring the hull. One of the airlocks has been blown
open.
To m ( E r i k ) : Looks like she's been boarded. I'll jump across. Don't
dock – if there are bad guys still over there, then the last thing we
want is them walking on board our ship.
Claire: Life signs?
Referee: Faint traces of three. Could be three people in low berth
freezer-tubes, or three people in hibernation...or three recently-
deceased corpses that're still cooling. Tom, you go through the front
airlock and push off, drifting for several seconds before bouncing
off the hull of the other ship. Your magnetic boots catch on, and
you can walk over the skin of the ship towards the airlock, gingerly
stepping over the areas melted by the lasers.
To m : Do I need a Vacc Suit check or a Zero-G check or anything?
Referee: Er...do you have both skills?

To m : Well, Zero-G level zero, so technically yes.
Referee: Nah, you don't need a check. You make it across fi ne.
To m : We'll keep communications channels open, and I'll feed my
suit's cameras back to the others so they can see what I see.
Referee: Sure. Are you going into the airlock?
Chris (Morn): *bzzt* I'll cover you with the laser turret.
To m : Where 'cover' is a synonym for 'burn me to a crisp if you fire
that thing anywhere near me when I'm only wearing a vacc suit. It's
like covering me with a nuclear missile.
Chris: I'd call that pretty damn covered.
Referee: Yo u s t e p t h r o u g h t h e a i r l o c k , i n t o t h e d a r k e n e d c o r r i d o r s
of the Beowulf. Air's gone...no artifi cial gravity... The beam from
your suit's torch cuts through the air, illuminating droplets of blood
floating like little worlds. Give me a Recon roll, please.
To m : Rolled a...6. Failed, unless it's an unusually easy one.
Referee: It's not. The cargo bay's splattered with blood, but all the
cargo appears to still be intact, although it's hard to tell with all
the crates drifting around. It looks like the upper deck might still
have pressure – the stairwells automatically iris shut if this lower
deck is breached.
To m : I'll go up and knock, I guess.
Referee: Yo u t a p y o u r g a u n t l e t a g a i n s t t h e m e t a l... a n d t h e r e ' s
an answering knock from above. You catch a glimpse of some
movement behind you... and suddenly, the sensor feed from Erik's
suit goes out!
Claire (Kathya): Erik! Can you read me? Erik! Erik? Erik?

TECHNOLOGY LEVELS
The concept of Technology Levels (TLs) runs through Tr a v e l l e r.
Te c h n o l o g y L e v e l s m e a s u r e t h e s c i e n t i fi c c a p a c i t y o f a w o r l d a n d
the complexity and effectiveness of a piece of equipment. The
Te c h n o l o g y L e v e l s c a l e s t a r t s a t 0 ; t h e I m p e r i u m ' s m o s t a d v a n c e d
scientists are probing the upper boundaries of TL 15, but most core
worlds range between 10 and 13. Out on the fringes of the Imperium
in sectors like the Spinward Marches, Technology Levels vary wildly.
Isolated systems that are visited only once or twice a generation
might have slipped back into the darkness, losing technology to
war or disaster. On other worlds, secret research bases, isolationist
colonies or Ancient relics hold scientifi c secrets of vast worth.

Even on a low-technology world, there might be examples of higher
technology. A warlord on a primitive planet might enforce his rule
with advanced weapons imported from offworld; colony worlds
are often dependant on their sponsor civilization for supplies
and support. Some low-technology worlds are aware of the larger
universe, and have consciously decided to reject higher technology.

TL 0: (Primitive) TL 0: (Primitive) No technology. TL 0 species have only discovered
the simplest tools and principles, and are on a par with Earth's
Stone Age.
TL 1: (Primitive) TL 1: (Primitive) Roughly on a par with Bronze or Iron age technology.
TL 1 science is mostly superstition, but they can manufacture
weapons and work metals.
TL 2: (Primitive) TL 2: (Primitive) Renaissance technology. TL 2 brings with it a
greater understanding of chemistry, physics, biology and astronomy
as well as the scientifi c method.

TL 3: (Primitive) TL 3: (Primitive) The advances of TL 2 are now applied, bringing the
germ of industrial revolution and steam power. Primitive fi rearms
now dominate the battlefield. This is roughly comparable to the
early 19th century.
TL 4: (Industrial) TL 4: (Industrial) The transition to industrial revolution is complete,
bringing plastics, radio and other such inventions. Roughly
comparable to the late 19th/early 20th century.
TL 5: (Industrial) TL 5: (Industrial) TL 5 brings widespread electrification, tele-
communications and internal combustion. At the high end of the
TL, atomics and primitive computing appear. Roughly on a par with
the mid–20th century.
TL 6: (Industrial) TL 6: (Industrial) TL 6 brings the development of fission power and
more advanced computing. Advances in materials technology and
rocketry bring about the dawn of the space age.
TL 7: (Pre-Stellar) TL 7: (Pre-Stellar) A pre-stellar society can reach orbit reliably and
has telecommunications satellites. Computers become common.
At the time of writing, humanity is currently somewhere between
TL 7 and TL 8.
TL 8: (Pre-Stellar) TL 8: (Pre-Stellar) At TL 8, it is possible to reach other worlds in
the same system, although terraforming or full colonization are not
within the culture's capacity. Permanent space habitats become
possible. Fusion power becomes commercially viable.
TL 9: (Pre-Stellar) TL 9: (Pre-Stellar) The defi ning element of TL 9 is the development
of gravity manipulation, which makes space travel vastly safer
and faster. This research leads to development of the Jump drive,
which occurs near the end of this Tech Level. TL 9 cultures can
colonize other worlds, although going to a colony is generally
a one-way trip.
TL 10: (Early Stellar) TL 10: (Early Stellar) With the advent of Jump, nearby systems
are opened up. Orbital habitats and factories become common.
Interstellar travel and trade lead to an economic boom. Colonies
become much more viable.
TL 11: (Early Stellar) TL 11: (Early Stellar) The fi rst true artifi cial intelligences become
possible, as computers are able to model synaptic networks. Grav-
supported structures reach to the heavens. Jump–2 travel becomes
possible, allowing easier travel beyond the one-Jump stellar mains.
TL 12: (Average Stellar) TL 12: (Average Stellar) Weather control revolutionises terraforming
and agriculture. Man-portable plasma weapons and carrier-mounted
fusion guns make the battlefi eld untenable for unarmored
combatants. Jump–3 travel is developed.
TL 13: (Average Stellar) TL 13: (Average Stellar) The battle dress appears on the battlefi eld
in response to the new weapons. Cloning of body parts becomes
easy. Advances in hull design and thruster plates means that
spacecraft can easily enter atmosphere and even go underwater.
Jump–4 travel.
TL 14: (Average Stellar) TL 14: (Average Stellar) Fusion weapons become man-portable.
Flying cities appear. Jump–5 travel.
TL 15: (High Stellar) TL 15: (High Stellar) Black globe generators suggest a new direction
for defensive technologies, while the development of synthetic
anagathics means that the human lifespan is now vastly increased.
Jump–6 travel.

Higher Technology Levels exist (indeed, there is no theoretical
upper limit) and may appear in other settings or be discovered by
pioneering scientists in the Third Imperium.

Galactic DirectionsGalactic Directions
North, south, east, and west are insuffi cient terms for referring to directions within the galaxy. Instead, the following conventions have achieved widespread acceptance
when referring to direction: Coreward – toward the galactic core; Rimward – toward the rim of the galaxy; Spinward – towards the direction the galaxy is rotating (or

4 spinning); Tr a i l i n g – opposite the spin of the galaxy.

TRAVELLER

In Tr a v e l l e r, a character's abilities and skills are determined largely
by his training and past experience. Character creation begins with
rolling your character's characteristics, six values that describe
his beginning physical and mental capabilities. After determining
characteristics and a few background skills from your homeworld,
it is time to embark on a career. Each character goes through one
or more four-year career terms, which give him various skills and
benefi ts. There are risks associated with each career – serving a tour
of duty in the Star Marines may give a character a grounding in
combat and weapons use, but the character risks injury in battle. A
term spent in a corporation is unlikely to get the character injured or
killed, but won't usually give skills valuable in combat.

In addition to skills, characters can pick up benefits such as cash
or contacts from a career. However, there are limits on how many
career terms a character can go through – the risks of aging or injury
mount up over time, and most characters will fi nd themselves trying
two or three careers. Do not be surprised if your character turns out
quite different to how you originally anticipated!

After going through one or more careers and collecting the
benefi ts, you can establish ties between your character and other
player characters and pick a campaign package, both of which
give extra skills.

Basic character generation should be done as a group by all
the players. For generating characters solitaire, and for other
alternate forms of character generation such as point allocation,
see page 40.

CHARACTERISTICS
Every person and creature in Tr a v e l l e r has several characteristics
that describe their base mental and physical potential. The basic
characteristics for a human are:

Strength (Str): Strength (Str): A character's physical strength, fi tness and
forcefulness.
Dexterity (Dex): Dexterity (Dex): Physical co-ordination and agility, reflexes. A
character's Dexterity affects his accuracy in ranged combat and his
reaction speed.
Endurance (End): Endurance (End): A character's ability to sustain damage, stamina
and determination. A character's resilience is based on his
Endurance score, so a character with a low Endurance score will be
very vulnerable in a fi refi ght.
Intelligence (Int): Intelligence (Int): A character's intellect and quickness of mind.
Intelligence is used in a great many skill checks.
Education (Edu): Education (Edu): A measure of a character's learning and experience.
Education is also used in a great many skill checks.
Social Standing (Soc): Social Standing (Soc): A character's place in society. Characters with
a high Social Standing can claim a noble title in the Imperium and
will fi nd life much easier thanks to their reputation and contacts.

### CCHARACTERHARACTER C CREATIONREATION

Character Generation Checklist
Basic character generation uses the following steps:

1. Roll characteristics and determine characteristic modifi ers.
2. a. Choose a homeworld.
b. Gain background skills.
3. a. Choose a career. You cannot choose a career you have
    already left.
b. Roll to qualify for that career.
c. If you qualify for that career, go to Step 4.
d. If you do not qualify for that career, then you can go to
    the Draft or enter the Drifter career. The Draft can put
    you back into a career you have been forced to leave, at
    your old rank. You can only apply for the Draft once.
4. If this is your fi rst time on this career, get your basic
    training.
5. Choose a specialization for this career.
6. a. Choose one of the Skills and Training tables for this
    career and roll on it.
b. Roll for survival on this career.
c. If you succeed, go to Step 7.
d. If you did not succeed, then events have forced you
    from this career. Roll on the Mishap table, then go to
    Step 9.
7. a. Roll for Events.
b. Optionally, establish a Connection with another player
    character.
8. a. Roll for Advancement
b. If you succeed, choose one of the skills and training
    tables for this career and roll on it. Increase your Rank
    and take any bonus skills from the Ranks table for this
    career.
c. If you roll less than the number of terms spent in this
    career, you must leave this career.
d. Military characters (Army, Navy, Marines) can roll for
    commission instead of rolling for advancement.
9. Increase your age by 4 years. If your character is 34 or older,
    roll for Aging.
10. If you are leaving the career, roll for Benefi ts.
11. If you have left your current career, then go to Step 3 to
    choose a new career, or to Step 12 if you wish to fi nish your
    character. Otherwise, go to Step 5.
12. Finalise any Connections with other characters.
13. Choose a Campaign Skill Pack and allocate skills from that
    pack.
14. Purchase starting equipment and, if you can afford it, a
    spacecraft.

The maximum level for a characteristic for an unaugmented human
character is 15.

SKILLS
Skills are the most important aspect of a character in Tr a v e l l e r,
and are discussed in detail in the chapter starting on page 48. A
character's profi ciency in a skill is denoted by his level in that skill.

If a character has no level in a skill, then he is untrained and will
suffer a –3 Dice Modifi er when trying to use that skill.

If a character has zero level in a skill (Skill 0), then he is competent in
using that skill, but has little experience. He does not get any bonus
from his skill ranks when using that skill but at least he avoids the
penalty for being untrained.

If a character has one or more level in a skill (Level 1, Level 2,
and so on) then he is trained in that skill. Each rank represents
several years of experience using that skill. A character with Level
2–3 in a skill is a skilled professional in that field. A character with
Medic 2 could be a doctor; a character with Medic 4 is a famous
surgeon or specialist.

Some skills have specialities – specialized forms of that skill. A
character picks a speciality when he gains level 1 in a skill with
specialities. For example, a character might have Engineer 0,

allowing him to make any Engineer skill checks without an unskilled
penalty. He might then gain a level in Engineer, giving him Engineer
(Jump drives) 1. He would make all Engineer checks involving Jump
drives at a +1 DM, but would make all other Engineer checks at a
+0 DM. A character can have multiple specialities in a skill – an
engineer might have Engineer (Jump drives) 1 and Engineer (power
plant) 2. He would make checks related to Jump drives with a +
DM, checks related to power plants with a +2 DM and all other
Engineer checks with a +0 DM.

BACKGROUND SKILLS
Before embarking on your careers, you get a number of background
skills equal to 3 + your Education DM (1 to 5, depending on your
Education score). You must take the skills listed for your homeworld;
any extra skills can be taken from the education list.

Homeworld: Homeworld: Growing up on your homeworld gave you skills that
depend on the planet's nature. You can select any skill that matches
your homeworld's planetary description and trade codes. If you
came from a planet already established by Tr a v e l l e r books or by the
Referee, then consult those sources for the planet's description.
Otherwise, just note down what traits you chose for your homeworld

- you can generate the world later using the rules on page 167.

(The defi nitions for these terms can be found on page 181.)

Education:Education: A formal education gives you a basic level of competence
in various sciences and academic disciplines. Any character may
choose from the following list:

Admin 0, Advocate 0, Art 0, Carouse 0, Comms 0, Computer 0, Drive
0, Engineer 0, Language 0, Medic 0, Physical Science 0, Life Science
0, Social Science 0, Space Science 0, Trade 0.

At this point, you are eighteen years old.

For example, Morn has an Education characteristic of 8, which has a
DM of +0. He therefore has 0+3 background skills. He comes from
a poor desert world, so he takes Animals 0 and Survival 0. He takes
Drive 0 from the education list.

CCHARACTERHARACTER C CREATIONREATION CHARACTER CREATION

CAREERS
Next, your character must take one or more career terms,
representing his previous experiences and adventures before the
start of the campaign. Each career term lasts for four years, even if a
character fails a Survival roll and is forced to leave a career.

At many points during a career, a character will have to make a throw
of some sort. Most of these throws are characteristic throws – roll
2d6, add the DM from the listed characteristic, and try to get a total
higher than the listed value. A throw of Int 8+ means 'roll 2d6, add
your Intelligence DM, and you succeed if you roll an 8 or more'. A
few throws are skill checks, where you add any levels in that skill and
the DM from an appropriate characteristic. For example, a throw of
Gunnery 8+ would mean 'roll 2d6, add your Gunnery skill and the
DM from an appropriate characteristic such as Dexterity, and get
over 8'. If the appropriate characteristic is not obvious, consult the
Skills chapter that starts on page 48.

In each career, there are three specializations. Pick one of those
when you enter the career.

Career Format
Qualifi cation: Qualifi cation: What you need to roll to enter that career. Military
careers use ' Enlistment' as the description for this roll instead
of qualifi cation. If you fail this check then you cannot enter your
chosen career this term. You must either submit to the Draft (see
opposite) or take the Drifter career for this term. You suffer a –
DM to qualifi cation rolls for each previous career you have entered.
Once you leave a career you cannot return to it. The Draft and the
Drifter career are exceptions to this rule – you can be Drafted into
a career you were previously in but got ejected from and the Drifter
career is always open.

Skills and Training: Skills and Training: Each career has four or fi ve skill tables associated
with it – Personal Development, Service Skills, Specialist Skills
(divided into three subtables corresponding to assignments) and
Advanced Education. In each term you spend in a career, pick one
of these tables and roll 1d6 to see which skill you increase. You may
only roll on the third table (Advanced Skills) if your character has
the listed qualifi cation (usually Education 8+ or a certain Rank). You
may only roll on the fourth table (Offi cer Skills) if your career has
one and if you have received a commission (see right).

Skills can be listed with or without an associated level. If no rank is
listed, then you gain that skill at Level 1 if you do not have it already,
or increases its level by one if you are already trained in that field.
If a rank is listed, then you gain the skill at that level as long as it is
better than your current level in that skill.

Examples: Examples:
Gambler 0 means you get the Gambler skill at level 0. This is of
benefi t to you only if you have no Gambler skill.

Vacc Suit means you increase your Vacc Suit skill by 1, or gain it at
level 1 if you have no Vacc Suit skill to begin with. If you have Vacc Suit
0, it increases to 1. If you have Vacc Suit 3, it rises to 4. And so on.

Streetwise 1 means you get the Streetwise skill at level 1. If your
Streetwise skill is already 1 or more, then this is of no benefit to
you. If you have no Streetwise skill, or it is only at 0, you jump
straight to 1.

Basic Training: Basic Training: For your fi rst career only, you get all the skills listed
in the Service Skills table at Level 0 as your basic training. For any
subsequent careers, you may pick any one skill listed in the Service
Skills table at Level 0 as your basic training.

Survival: Survival: Each career has a survival roll. If you fail this roll, roll on the
mishap table. This mishap is always enough to force you to leave
the service. You lose the benefi t roll for the current term only. A
natural 2 is always a failure.

Events: Events: If you are still in your career after resolving the survival roll, roll
on the events table to see what interesting things befall you this term.

Commission: Commission: This only applies to the military careers of Army,
Navy and Marines. A character who succeeds at a commission roll
becomes a Rank 1 offi cer in that career, and uses the offi cer Rank
table from then on. A character may attempt a commission roll once
per term, and trying for commission is optional.

If you obtain a commission after having already advanced several ranks,
you become a Rank 1 officer as normal but you may add your two final
ranks together for the purposes of determining benefits and pensions.

Some events give a bonus DM to advancement rolls (see below),
or give automatic advancement. You can apply these DMs to
commission rolls also.

+++The DeSalo corporation is hiring freelance security personnel and transport vessels for a private operation. Contact our representative at the starport hiring hall if you
have suitable qualifi cations. We offer extremely competitive rates and full medical cover.+++

The Connections Rule
If both players agree, then any event can involve another suitable
player character. Only one character needs to have rolled the
specifi c event. If this is done, then you both get one extra skill.
This can be any skill you like, although it is good form to relate
it to the connection you have just formed. You may gain a
maximum of two free skills from this rule, and each connection
must be with a different player character.

For example, Erik is serving as an Agent, and he rolls an
undercover mission (Event number 8 on the Agent event table).
Erik's player suggests that Erik could have met Kathya while
on this mission, and Kathya's player agrees. When finalising
characters, both will gain an extra skill roll.

Note down ideas for connections as you generate your character
but these connections are only finalised at the end of character
generation. See page 37.

Later during character creation, Erik rolls a mishap on his Agent
career, and is nearly killed when an undercover operation goes
wrong. Kathya's player suggests that she helped him escape and
so he owes her his life.

CHARACTER CREATION CHARACTER CREATION

Advancement: Advancement: Each career has an advancement roll. The advancement
roll is mandatory. If an Event has already automatically promoted the
character this term this is in addition to the advancement roll (so it
is possible character may be promoted twice in a single term).

If you make a successful Advancement roll, then you move to the
next rank and gain an extra roll on any of the Skills and Training
Ta b l e s f o r t h i s c a r e e r. Yo u a l s o g e t a n y b e n e fi t s l i s t e d f o r y o u r n e w
rank. You may only attempt to advance once per term.

If your result is equal to or less than the number of terms you have
spent in this career, then you cannot continue in this career after
this term. Either your services are no longer required, or events
have caused you to leave, or perhaps you are simply bored and
want a new challenge.

If you roll a natural 12, then you must continue in this career.

Ranks and Benefi ts: Ranks and Benefi ts: You start at Rank 0 in your career. Each time
you succeed at an advancement check, you move onto the next
Rank. Ranks are most important for military careers, like the Army
or Navy, but every career has its own internal hierarchies and levels
of authority and responsibility. Not all ranks have a title.

Some ranks have benefits associated with them, such as extra skills or
more benefits. You gain these benefits as soon as you attain that rank.

Mustering-Out Benefi ts:Mustering-Out Benefi ts: When you leave a career for any reason,
you gain material benefits from that career. There are two tables –
Cash and Benefi ts. You may only roll on the cash tables a maximum
of three times, regardless of how many careers or benefit rolls you
have. You get one benefi t roll per full term served. Leaving due to
a mishap means you lose the benefit roll for that term, but not
previous full terms in that career.

If you reached rank 1 or 2, you get an extra benefi t roll when leaving
that service. If you reached rank 3 or 4, you get two extra benefit
rolls, and if you reached rank 5 or 6, you get three extra benefi t rolls
and may apply a +1 to rolls on the Benefi ts table that you gain from
that career. Benefi ts are described more fully on page 34.

Drifters and The Draft
Yo u m a y a t t e m p t t o e n l i s t i n o n e c a r e e r e a c h t e r m i f y o u a r e n o t
continuing on in an existing career. If you fail to for a new career, you
have two options. You can apply to the Draft and be randomly sent
to one of the military services or you may spend that term travelling
through known space as a Drifter without a career or purpose. A
character may only enter the Draft once.

Behind the ClawBehind the Claw
A slang term used by inhabitants of the Spinward Marches, Deneb and Trojan Reach sectors to refer to those areas. The term derives from a supposed
resemblance between a claw and the Great Rift as seen on maps of the Imperium. Inhabitants of this region feel a certain pride in this designation, and
is used to imply they share a camaraderie and common interest. The name was once used as the title of a popular news magazine with a circulation
area encompassing the three sectors named above. The term is rarely used by inhabitants of other areas of the Imperium.

Ancient TechnologyAncient Technology
The Ancients left technological wonders scattered throughout space, and these artefacts are sought after by the Imperium as well as rival governments, megacorporations, research institute, criminals and
mad scientists. Those lucky enough to fi nd such artefacts may have made their fortunes – or signed their death warrants. Ancient artefacts range in size from personal items or weapons to starships, or even
vast ringworlds millions of kilometers across. The more intact an Ancient device is, the more likely it is to be defended...

The artefact...

1. ...is severely damaged. The characters will need to fi nd the missing parts to repair it.
2. ...is a fake, planted by a criminal gang who intended to sell the location to the Imperium. By removing the artefact, the characters have unwittingly foiled the gang and incurred
    their wrath. 33

LIFE EVENTS
Even in the distant future, humans are still people. (In fact, some
non-humans are also people...) They work, they quarrel, they get
sick, they fall in love, they complain about their in-laws... in short,
life goes on. If you roll a Life Event on the Events table for your
career, roll on the Life Events table at the bottom of this page.

MUSTERING OUT BENEFITS
In the course of a character's career, he may manage to save some
money. He may also acquire equipment and other benefits from his
previous employers – a scout might be mustered out of the service
with a reserve scout ship, a marine might get to keep his battle
armor and so on. These are determined by Benefi t Rolls.

Benefi ts are gained when a character leaves a career for any reason
other than failing a survival roll (willingly leaving the career, an
event, an aging crisis, or just wishing to fi nish character generation).
A character gets one Benefit Roll for every full term served in that
career. You also get extra benefi t rolls if you reached a higher rank.

BENEFITS OF RANK

Highest Rank Highest Rank
ReachedReached Bonus Benefi t RollsBonus Benefi t Rolls
1–2 1
3–4 2
5–6 3, and you get a +1 DM to all Benefit Rolls in this career.

There are two tables for Benefit Rolls – the Cash table and the Other
Benefi ts table. You may only roll on the Cash table a maximum of
three times no matter how many careers you have had.

Cash Benefits
A character with the Gambler skill at level 1 or better gets a +1 DM
to all rolls on the Cash table.

If the character has any money after rolling on the Cash table then
he may purchase personal equipment worth up to 2,000 credits
immediately. More expensive items can be bought in play but the
characters will have to seek them out. Any left-over money can be
taken as cash, trade goods or just saved with a fi nancial institution.

Other Benefits
When you leave a career in good standing with your previous
employers, you are permitted to keep various pieces of equipment
or even shares of a vessel. Different careers give different benefi ts.
For details of material benefits, see the Equipment chapter that
starts on page 86. For details regarding Allies and Contacts,
see page 76.

Air/Raft: Air/Raft: You receive an air/raft (see page 103). If you roll this benefi t
again, gain a level of Flyer (grav).

Armor: Armor: Select one of the following types of armor – Cloth, Reflec,
Vacc Suit, HEV Suit, Combat Armor or Subdermal Armor. (See the
Equipment chapter starting on page 86.) If you roll this benefit again,
then gain the Vacc Suit or Battle Dress skill or another type of armor.

career.

of the ship, but the ship is still the property of the Scout service, and
can be called back into active duty if needed. Alternatively, you can
take 1d6 ship shares instead.

Ship's Boat: Ship's Boat: You receive a Ship's Boat (see page 132). If you roll this
benefi t again, gain a level of Pilot (small craft).

Ship Shares: Ship Shares: You obtain one or more ship shares that can be put

TAS: TAS: You are a member of the Traveller's Aid Society (TAS), a private
organization that maintains hostels and facilities at all class A and
B starports in many parts of human space. Facilities are available to
members and their guests. Membership may only be achieved once
per character. Receipt of membership in the Traveller's Aid Society
upon mustering out may be construed as a reward for heroism or
extraordinary service to the Society rather than an official benefi t of
service. Membership is for life and is not transferable.

Membership may be purchased at the cost of 1,000,000 Credits
although it is possible for an application to be 'black-balled' by
an existing member. The Traveller's Aid Society is an exclusive
organization, made up of those who are truly citizens of the galaxy,
not just a single world.

The TAS invests its membership fees and other incomes; it uses
its capital and return to provide benefits to its members. Every two
months, it pays dividends in the form of one high passage (see page
142) to each member. This passage may be used, retained or sold.

If you roll this benefi t again, gain two ship shares instead.

Contacts, Allies, Rivals and Enemies
Over the course of their previous careers, characters will have
made friends and foes and establish ties with various non-player
characters who may play a part in future adventures. There are
four categories of such associates:

Contacts Contacts are individuals that the character knows and has had
friendly dealings with in the past. They have useful skills or
positions, and may be willing to aid the character.

Allies Allies are like contacts, but are willing to help the characters and
will actively go out of their way to provide aid.

Both allies and contacts can be patrons patrons (see page 77).

RivalsRivals are people who hate or oppose the character, and will
attempt to interfere or harass him. Enemies Enemies are even worse than
rivals – a rival seeks to one-up or humiliate, but an enemy wants
the character dead, imprisoned or otherwise doomed.

When you gain an associate from a random event, note it on your
character sheet. You can give as much detail as you wish, from
the sketchy ('Rival in Navy') to the detailed ('Captain Harrick
of the Pride of Sylea is my rival, because I disobeyed his orders
while on a mission. He had me drummed out of the Navy, damn
him! I'll have my revenge on him one day!')

Other player characters can be Contacts, Allies or even Rivals for
the purposes of the Connections rule (see page 8).

CCHARACTERHARACTER C CREATIONREATION CHARACTER CREATION

Ship Shares
Ship shares represent contacts, credit rating, savings and favors
owed that a character can put towards ownership of a space vessel.
Characters can pool their ship shares towards the use of a vessel,
but cannot trade ship shares for cash. It's very unlikely that the
characters will be able to own anything other than the smallest
starship outright at the start of the game, so most Tr a v e l l e r crews
end up working to support the mortgage on their spacecraft.

Characters can also get extra ship shares by taking an older and
more damaged ship, to a maximum of 10 bonus ship shares. See
Old Ships on page 136.

Each ship share reduces the cost of the ship by 1%.

*If you roll a Scout ship on the Scout Benefits table, then you have a
ship on loan from the Scout Service and do not need to pay for it.

Retirement Pay
A character that leaves a service (other than Scout, Rogue or Drifter)
at the end of the 5th or later term of service is considered to have
retired and receives retirement pay. This pension is paid at the
beginning of each year, effective upon leaving the service, and may
be collected at any class A or B starport.

AGING AND INJURIES
Aging and injuries can both reduce characteristics before play
begins. There are ways to ameliorate the effects of both aging and
injuries. Characters can prolong their youth using anagathics (drugs
that slow the aging process), but these are hard to find, expensive,
and illegal or socially unacceptable in many parts of the Imperium.
Injuries can be cured using medical care.

Both drugs and medical care are expensive, and will drain a
character's fi nances. A character must keep track of how much
money he spends on anagathics and medical care.

Aging
The effects of aging begin when a character reaches 34 years of age
(their fourth four-year career term). At the end of the fourth term,
and at the end of every term thereafter, the character must roll 2d6
on the Aging Table. Apply the character's total number of terms as a
negative Dice Modifi er on this table.

AGING TABLE
2d62d6 Effects of AgingEffects of Aging
–6 Reduce three physical characteristics by 2,

–3 Reduce one physical characteristic by 2,
reduce two physical characteristic by 1
–2 Reduce three physical characteristics by 1
–1 Reduce two physical characteristics by 1
0 Reduce one physical characteristic by 1
1+ No effect

The character may choose which characteristics are affected by
aging.

Aging Crisis: Aging Crisis: If any characteristic is reduced to 0 by aging, then
the character suffers an aging crisis. The character dies unless
he can pay 1d6 10,000 credits for medical care, which will bring
any characteristics back up to 1. The character automatically fails
any Qualifi cation checks from now on – he must either continue
in the career he is in or become a Drifter if he wishes to take
any more terms.

Anagathics: Anagathics: A character can start taking anagathics at any time.
While using anagathic drugs, the character effectively does not
age – add the number of terms since the character started taking
anagathics as a positive Dice Modifier to rolls on the aging table. If
a character stops taking anagathics, then he must roll immediately

Optional Rule: Maximum Terms
A character sticking to well-paying and safe careers can avoid
aging almost indefi nitely. The Referee may wish to impose a
limit on the number of terms taken during character creation. A
limit of three terms will produce characters that are competent
in one or two fi elds, but still have a lot to learn. A limit of six
terms will give experienced and skilled characters who can take
on dangerous missions. Past six terms, it becomes increasingly
likely that the characters will be much too rich and influential
to bother with minor assignments. ('I'm a duke, and my friend
here was an admiral! Why are we wandering the galaxy instead
of sitting in our palaces?')

CHARACTER CREATION CCHARACTERHARACTER C CREATIONREATION

on the aging table to simulate the shock that comes from his system
beginning to age again.

Anagathics have two drawbacks. Firstly, the risk of trying to obtain
a reliable supply and the disruption to the character's biochemistry
means the character must make a second Survival check if he
passes his fi rst Survival check in a term. If either check is failed, the
character suffers a mishap and is ejected from the career.

Secondly, the drugs cost 1d6 2,500 Credits for each term that the
character uses the drugs. These costs are paid out of the character's
eventual mustering-out cash benefi ts. If the character cannot pay these
bills, he goes into debt – see Medical Debt on the following page.

Aging and Anagathics During Play: Aging and Anagathics During Play: If your campaign lasts long
enough, characters will have to make further aging rolls every
four years. Characters may also seek out anagathic drugs during
play – see Anagathic Drugs on page 94.

Injuries
Characters that are wounded in combat or accidents during
character creation must roll on the Injury table to see how bad their
injuries were.

INJURY TABLE
1d61d6 InjuryInjury
1 Nearly killed. Reduce one physical characteristic by 1d6,
reduce both other physical characteristics by 2 (or one of
them by 4).
2 Severely injured. Reduce one physical characteristic by 1d6.
3 Missing eye or limb. Reduce Strength or Dexterity by 2.
4 Scarred. You are scarred and injured. Reduce any one
physical characteristic by 2.
5 Injured. Reduce any physical characteristic by 1.
6 Lightly injured. No permanent effect.

The character may choose which characteristics are affected by
injury.

Injury Crisis: Injury Crisis: If any characteristic is reduced to 0, then the character
suffers an injury crisis. The character dies unless he can pay 1d6
10,000 credits for medical care, which will bring any characteristics
back up to 1. The character automatically fails any Qualifi cation
checks from now on – he must either continue in the career he is in
or become a Drifter if he wishes to take any more terms.

Medical Care: Medical Care: If your character has been injured, then medical care
may be able to undo the effects of damage. Some worlds in the
Imperium have the technology to clone or rebuild damaged organs;
other worlds specialize in transplants or cybernetic replacements.
Regardless of the technique used, medical care is expensive.

The restoration of a lost characteristic costs 5,000 Credits per point.

If your character was injured in the service of a patron or organization,
then a portion of his medical care may be paid for by that patron.
Roll 2d6 on the table below, adding your Rank as a DM. The result is
how much of his medical care is paid for by his employer.

Scout/Rogue/Drifter 0% 50% 75%

For example, Morn suffers a missing limb during his career as a
barbarian, reducing his Strength by 2. He has the limb regrown at
the starport hospital, at the cost of 10,000 credits. He has to pay this
entire amount himself – but he has no money. Morn starts the game
with a 10,000 Credit debt to the hospital.

Medical Debt
During fi nishing touches, you must pay any outstanding costs from
medical care or anagathic drugs out of your Benefi ts before anything
else. Any debt left is hanging over your character at the start
of the game.

FINISHING TOUCHES
Once you have gone through all the career terms you want, rolled
for your skills and benefits, and resolved the effects of any aging or
injuries, it is time to move onto fi nishing touches.

Finalise Connections
The connections between characters rule (see page 8) can give you
bonus skills. At this stage, you may make (or fi nalise) a connection
between your character and up to two other player characters. For
each connection you make, you may gain one level in any skill, but
you cannot bring a skill above level 3 using this rule nor may you
take the Jack of all Trades skill.

For example, Erik has a bonus skill from his connection to Kathya.
He could use it to bring his Stealth skill from level 2 to level 3, but
could not use it to bring his Computer score from level 3 to level 4.

Breathing Life Into Your Character
At this stage of character generation, you have guided your character
from his homeworld to the present day. Take some time to consider
the parts of his nature that are not represented by numbers on the
character sheet. Who is he? How has his past shaped his beliefs?
What cause is he willing to fi ght for? Does he have any odd tics or
habits? What does he want?

SkillPackages
As a group, select one of the following skill packages, which are
collections of basic skills you will use while adventuring and

travelling. Taking a skill package ensures that your group will at least
have basic competency in the situations that will come up in the
game. When you have collectively decided which skill package is
most suitable for the campaign you want to play, each player takes
it in turns to select an item from the package. Keep going until all
skills have been selected.

Loyalty to another character?

CHARACTER CREATION EXAMPLE
The following example is given to illustrate the process of character
generation. Actual die throws are shown in brackets, as are
comments on the application of game rules. Die modifications are
labelled DM.

Alexander Lascelles Jamison: Alexander Lascelles Jamison: First, Jamison rolls for his
Characteristics. He rolls: Str 6 (DM +0) Dex 8 (DM +0) End 8 (DM
+0) Int 12 (DM +2) Edu 8 (DM +0) Soc 9 (DM +1). His Edu DM of
+0 gives him three background skills based on his homeworld – a
high-population, high-technology world. He takes Computers 0 and
Streetwise 0 for his homeworld skills, and chooses Drive 0 from the
education list.

Having just fi nished school, Jamison sets out to win his fortune
in the universe. Taking stock of himself and his personal qualities,
he soon decides that his characteristics adapt him best for the
merchant service.

He visits his local starport, checks out the situation [required roll of
4+ to enlist, with a DM of +2 allowed for his intelligence of 12; he
rolls a 2! (+2=4)], and just barely manages to convince a merchant
captain to let him sign on. He is now in the merchant marine.

First Term: First Term: As this is Jamison's fi rst term in this new career, he is
given a basic training in all aspects of ship handling [he gains all
the Service Skills at level 0, gaining Vacc Suit 0, Broker 0, Steward 0,
Comms 0 and Persuade 0.] He would also learn Drive 0 as a service
skill but he has already got Drive at level 0 from his background and
so gains no benefi t. He also learns to pilot the ship [Roll of a 1 on
the Merchant Marine Specialist skills table].

During his fi rst term of service [survival roll required is 4+; he rolls
11 (+0=11)] he faces no great dangers. The merchant ship has a run
of luck [Event roll of 10, giving him a +1 DM to any one Benefi t roll],
and Jamison studies in the hopes of being promoted. He scrapes
past his exams [Merchant Marine promotion requires 7; he rolls a
5, +2 for his Intelligence] and is promoted to 4th Offi cer [gaining
the Mechanic 1 skill]. He also gains another skill [Roll of a 1 on the
Advanced Education table gives him a Social Science.]

Second Term:Second Term: The ship's luck runs out as it heads into dangerous
space. Jamison is trained to man the guns [Roll of a 6 on the
merchant Marine Specialist table gives him Gunner (any) 1].
Jamison survives [passing his Survival roll easily with a 7] and picks
up a basic knowledge of electronics [roll of a 4 on the Events table,
taking Engineer (electronics) 1.] He tries for promotion again, and
succeeds [Requires a 7; he rolls a 6, and has a +2 for his Int, giving
him an 8]. He continues his advanced studies, learning to operate
the ship's computer [roll of a 3 on the Advanced Education table,
giving him Computers 1.]

Third Term: Third Term: Jamison serves in the engineering section, improving
his Mechanic skill [rolls a 4 on the Merchant Marine specialist table,

CHARACTER CREATION CCHARACTERHARACTER C CREATIONREATION

and he already has Mechanic 1, so it goes up to Mechanic 2]. He
again avoids disaster [passes his Survival roll]. In a starport on a
distant world, he runs into a scout named Tash [Event roll of 6] who
hitches a ride on the merchant ship and the two become friends.
[Tash is another player character, and the two now have a potential
Connection.]

Jamison continues to advance in the Merchant service [rolls an 8
for promotion, with a +2 DM for his Intelligence]. He is now a 2nd
Offi cer. His new role involves taking care of the ship's paperwork
[rolls a 5 on the Advanced Education table, picking up Admin 1].

Fourth Term: Fourth Term: Having heard tales of terror from his new Scout friend,
Jamison tries to pick up some weapons skills, but he really just
learns to keep his head down [rolls on the Personal Development
table, hoping for the Melee (blade) skill, but rolls a 6 and picks up
Streetwise instead). Again, he is uninjured [rolls an 8 on his Survival
roll], but he is given an interesting proposition – a criminal syndicate
wants to smuggle some goods offworld, and Jamison's role as 2nd
Offi cer means he could alter the cargo manifest to hide the goods.
[Rolls a 3 on Event table]. If he refuses, the criminal syndicate will
be... displeased. Jamison has to persuade the cargo master to
go along with the scam [requires a Persuade check; Jamison has
Persuade 0 and a +1 DM from his Social Standing, but he only rolls
a 6, failing the check and gaining nothing].

Despite the black mark on his record for his attempted smuggling,
he again wins promotion [rolls a 9 for his promotion roll, +2 for
Intelligence]. He is now a 1st Offi cer. [This rank gives the Pilot 1 skill;
as Jamison already has Pilot (spacecraft) 1, applying his new skill
there would do no good so he applies this second Pilot skill to small
craft instead.]

At the end of this term, Jamison must make an Aging roll. [He rolls
a 4, –4 for his total number of terms, for a result of 0. He loses one
point from any one Physical Characteristic, and chooses to reduce
his Dexterity to 7.]

Fifth Term: Fifth Term: Jamison learns the art of negotiation [rolls a 3 on the
Service Skill table, gaining Broker 1]. Perhaps feeling that he has
been too focussed on his career, Jamison begins courting a beautiful
woman in the Bureau of Trade named Sya [rolls a 7 on the Event table,
for a life event, and rolls a 5 on the Life Events table, indicating a
new Relationship. One of the other players leaps on this, suggesting
that Jamison has fallen for her undercover agent, Sya.]

Next, he tries for promotion, but is instead forced to leave the service
at the end of this term (he rolls a 3, +2 for his Intelligence, but his
total of fi ve is less than or equal to the number of terms spent in this
service. Finally, he rolls for Aging again [with a –5 DM for fi ve terms
served, he rolls a 5, for another 0, dropping his Endurance to 7)

Mustering Out: Mustering Out: Having completed twenty years of active duty in
the merchant service, 1st Offi cer Jamison is eligible for a variety of
service benefi ts [fi ve rolls on the tables for terms served, plus two
by virtue of his rank; in addition, he is allowed a single +1 modifi er
from the event in his first term]. He receives [Cash table, rolls of a 6,
a 4 and a 4] a severance bonus of Cr. 80,000. He also receives:
[Roll of a 4, +1 for his event in Term 1 = 5]: A blade.
[Roll of a 6] Shares towards a free trader.
[Roll of a 6] More shares towards his free trader.
[Roll of a 3] An education benefi t [+1 Edu].

Sixth Term: Sixth Term: Jamison could go adventuring now, but he decides to risk
another term in one of the services. He can't re-enter the Merchants,
so he picks the Entertainer class, aiming at the Journalist speciality.
He needs to roll a 5+, adding his Intelligence DM of +2, but has a
–1 DM because he's already gone through one career. He rolls a 6,
and passes.

He picks up Deception 0 [one skill from the service skills list] as
basic training and rolls Computers on the Journalist skill table.
Unfortunately, he fails his Survival check for the term, and is betrayed
by a peer (result #4). As the only contact that Jamison has picked up
is another player character, and the Referee doesn't want in-fi ghting
at the start of the campaign, it's agreed that Jamison is betrayed by
a fellow journalist, who becomes a Rival. So much for Jamison's
planned expose of insider trading!

As Jamison failed his Survival roll in the first term of this career,
he doesn't get any Benefi ts. All that's left to do this term is roll for
aging, which passes without incident.

Jamison has two Connections – one to the Scout Tashen, and the
other to Sya. He chooses to use both to increase his Pilot (spacecraft)
skill to 3. Next, the group pick a Skill Package – Jamison gets Gun
Combat (slug pistol) 1 and Sensors 1 out of it.

CCHARACTERHARACTER C CREATIONREATION CHARACTER CREATION

Pooling the ship shares of the other characters, the group is able
to afford a reasonable mortgage on a Free Trader. He hires his old
Scout friend as navigator, and invites Sya to travel with him.

Alexander Lascelles Jamison is now 42 years old, a retired merchant
captain, with a pension of Cr. 10,000 per year and a healthy cash
balance. Considering that the merchants forced him out of the
service at the peak of his career, he has some slight resentment
against the merchant service. He is also utterly unaware that his
love is actually an Imperial agent who is using him as a cover...

ALTERNATE CHARACTER

GENERATION RULES
The standard form of Tr a v e l l e r character generation is recommended
for most campaigns, but some players or Referees may prefer these
alternate modes.

Alternate Characteristics and Events
Referees are encouraged to customise characteristics and events
for their campaigns. For example, if a campaign is set in a particular
Milieu such as the Rule of Man, the Referee might replace one
or two generic events in each events table with ones tailored
to that campaign.

It is also possible to add characteristics. In a campaign centered
around political intrigue and diplomacy, an Influence or Charm
characteristic could be added. A game where the characters
encounter ancient alien space gods who drive people insane might
add a Sanity characteristic. An investigative game might add a
Perception characteristic.

Solo Generation
Solo character generation works just like normal character
generation, with the following minor changes:

- The Connections Rule: The Connections Rule: Instead of making connections to other
    player characters, the Referee should provide a list of characters,
    organizations or places in his campaign that are suitable for
    connections. For example, you might get a bonus skill if you
    had a connection with the Imperial Intelligence service, or were
    on the run from the law and were willing to take passage on the
    first ship to hire you.
- Skill Packages: Skill Packages: Instead of picking a skill package, gain any one
    skill at Level 1.

Iron Man Character Generation
In the original Tr a v e l l e r rules, if you failed a survival roll, your
character was killed. The Iron Man rules repeat that challenge –
instead of rolling on the mishap table if you fail a survival roll, your
character is killed and you must start again. Under the Iron Man
rules, you must balance the advantages garnered from spending
another term in a career with the risk of dying in action.

Other than these changes, Iron Man works just like normal
character generation.

Select Skills
In this variant, the player picks skills from the various Skills and
Tr a i n i n g t a b l e s i n s t e a d o f r o l l i n g r a n d o m l y f o r t h e m. I n a l l o t h e r
ways, it is identical to standard generation.

Point Allocation
Instead of rolling on the career tables, you can buy a character's
characteristics and skills using points.

### AALIELIENSNS

Humanity shares the stars with hundreds of alien races. Most are
restricted to a handful of worlds, but there are several races who
rival the Imperium in power and influence.

Alien characters use many of the same characteristics as humans

- they have Strength, Dexterity, Endurance, Intelligence and
Education. However, alien species may have different criteria for
Social Standing: Caste (a genetic structure for social hierarchy) or
Charisma (small group hierarchy). Even Social Standing for aliens
may not apply when interacting with humans. When dealing with a
race that has a different concept of Social Standing, all DMs from
Social Standing or its alien equivalent – whether positive or negative
- are halved.

In addition to their characteristics, aliens may have one or more of
the alien traits below.

Armored: Armored: The alien possess thick fur, scales, a bony exoskeleton
or other natural protection that gives it one point of natural armor.
This works in the same way as normal armor – see page 66.

Aquatic: Aquatic: The alien is adapted to life underwater. It can breathe
underwater, or hold its breath for a long period (Endurance 10
minutes on average). If amphibious, its Dexterity is halved on land.
If the species is not amphibious, then it cannot operate out of water
without mechanical aid or telepresence.

Atmospheric Requirements: Atmospheric Requirements: The species requires an unusual
combination of gasses to breathe, and cannot survive in most
atmospheres without artificial aid. Creatures with this trait usually
come from homeworlds with an Exotic atmosphere.

Engineered: Engineered: The species has been altered by some external factor
to adapt to changed circumstances or a different environment.
Medical treatment of Engineered species by a facility of a lower
Te c h n o l o g y L e v e l t h a n t h a t a t w h i c h t h e s p e c i e s w a s c r e a t e d r e c e i v e s
a negative DM equal to the difference. Some strains of humans have
been engineered to tolerate unusual atmospheres, to live on water
worlds, or to cope with the stresses of space travel.

Fast Metabolism: Fast Metabolism: Creatures with a fast metabolism require more
food than most species, and their life support costs are doubled.
In combat, fast-metabolism creatures gain a +2 initiative bonus.
Fast-metabolism creatures halve their Endurance for the purposes
of determining fatigue.

Feral: Feral: Feral species are uncivilised, regardless of their technological
knowledge. Often, such species have acquired their technology
from other races, or from Ancient ruins. Feral species are much less
likely to accept the laws of more civilised societies. Feral species roll
Education on 1d6 only.

Flyer: Flyer: The species can fly using wings, glider membranes, gasbags
or other means. Characters of this species gain the Athletics (flying)
skill at Level 0 and can travel at a speed noted in their description.
Flying creatures who are aloft must spend one minor action every
round on movement or stall and fall out of the air.

- Winged flight is tiring and can only be sustained for a number
    of rounds equal to the creature's Endurance before requiring a
    like amount of rest. Some specialized avians can increase this
    to minutes or even hours equal to Endurance.
- Species with glider membranes cannot gain altitude while flying.
    They descend one meter every time they move forwards and
    cannot use more than one minor action for flying movement in
    a round.
- Species that float using gasbags or some other method do not
    need to move to remain aloft. They are typically slower than
    other fliers, though.

Large: Large: The species is considerably larger than the average for
sophonts. Large creatures generally have a Strength and Endurance
of 3d6 or even 4d6, and a Dexterity of 1d6. Life support requirements
for Large creatures are doubled and they often have trouble operating
in buildings and spacecraft designed for smaller creatures.

- Some Large creatures are described as Huge. Attacks against
    Huge creatures receive a +1 DM to hit.

Natural Weapon: Natural Weapon: The species has a natural weapon, such as claws,
a strong bite or a poisonous stinger. Such weapons are usable
at Personal range and deal 1 damage. The creature gains Melee
(natural weapons) at level 0.

No Fine Manipulators:No Fine Manipulators: The species has no fi ngers or other prehensile
appendages, preventing them from easily picking things up, pushing
small buttons, reaching into tight spaces, and so on. The species
will need special equipment to function in most civilised settings.

The Universal Personality Profile
Characters may be precisely defi ned using the Universal
Personality Profi le (the UPP), which expresses the basic
characteristics in a specific sequence, using a notation which
resembles hexadecimal (base 16). In hexadecimal notation,
the digits 0 through 9 are represented by common Arabic
numbers; the digits 10 to 15 are represented by the letters A
through F. The highest single digit in base 16 is 15, denoted as
F. Characteristics are listed as a string of six digits, in the order
of Strength, Dexterity, Endurance, Intelligence, Education and
Social Standing.

A character who is average in all respects would have a UPP of

777777. If, however, he was highly intelligent, his UPP would be
777B77 (the B for Intelligence indicating an Intelligence of 11).
Captain Jamison would have 677B99.

The UPP is extensively used in Tr a v e l l e r: it makes it possible to
easily list large numbers of characters.

CCHARACTERHARACTER C CREATIONREATION CHARACTER CREATION

Notable (Characteristic)Notable (Characteristic): Some species are notably dextrous,
intelligent, tough or strong. Characters from such races have a
positive Dice Modifi er when rolling for that characteristic (+2
unless otherwise specified), and their racial maximum for that
characteristic is increased by the same amount. Any characteristic
can be Notable.

Psionic: Psionic: All members of the species are Psionic, and may determine
their Psionic Strength and talents at the start of character generation.
For more information on psionics, see the chapter starting
on page 152.

Small: Small: Small species generally have a Strength and Endurance of
only 1d6, and a Dexterity of 3d6. The minimum size for a sophont
is about half that of a human, as smaller creatures lack the cranial
capacity for sophont-level intelligence. This assumes that the
species has a brain structure comparable to humans. Species with
a more distributed neural structure, hive intelligences, or artificial
intelligences can be even smaller.

- Some Small creatures are described as Tiny. Attacks against
    Tiny creatures receive a –1 DM to hit.

Slow Metabolism:Slow Metabolism: Creatures with a slow metabolism require less
food than most species, and their life support costs are halved.
In combat, slow-metabolism creatures suffer a –2
initiative penalty.

Uplifted: Uplifted: This species was originally non-sentient,
but has been raised to a higher intelligence by
another species. Uplifted races generally become
client species of their patron. Two common uplifted
animals are apes and dolphins:

- Uplifted apes have Notable Strength and Endurance (+2) but
    all other characteristics are Weak (–2). They have the Uplifted
    trait.
- Uplifted dolphins have Notable Strength (+4) and Notable
    Endurance (+2) but Weak Intelligence, Education and Social
    Standing (–2). They have the Uplifted, Aquatic (fully aquatic,
    air-breathers) and No Fine Manipulators traits.

Weak (Characteristic): Weak (Characteristic): The opposite of Notable (Characteristic),
some species are weaker, less resilient or less well educated than
others. Characters from such races have a negative Dice Modifier
when rolling for that characteristic (–2 unless otherwise specified),
and their racial maximum for that characteristic is decreased by
the same amount. Any characteristic can be Weak.

For the most part, aliens use the same careers and event tables
as humans, but the Referee and player should modify the tables
to refl ect the unique cultures and biologies of alien races. A Hiver
Naval Offi cer, for example, might replace the event 'You foil an
attempted mutiny or crime on board. Gain an Enemy, but also
gain a +2 DM to your next Advancement roll in the Navy.' with
'Yo u d r i v e a h u m a n s h i p o u t o f a n i n t e r d i c t e d s y s t e m. G a i n a n

Enemy, but also gain a +2 DM to your next Advancement roll in the
Navy'. In particular, the Life Events table should be rewritten for
each race. (Upcoming Tr a v e l l e r sourcebooks will give more details
for different species and cultures.)

Alien Species in the Third Imperium
The Third Imperium setting features a number of distinct alien
races. Presented here is an overview of the six major ones, although
it should be pointed out that since each could fi ll a book all to itself
the coverage here is necessarily brief and incomplete.

ASLAN
Aslan are roughly human-sized and humanoid, and are descended
from four-limbed, upright, bipedal carnivore-pouncer stock. The
earliest [[Terra|Terran]] explorers saw in them a vague resemblance to the
Te r r a n l i o n , a n d t h e y h a v e b e e n d e s c r i b e d b y Te r r a n s a s l i o n - l i k e e v e r
since. There are two sexes, male and female. The male is most easily
distinguishable by his larger size and prominent mane. Females
outnumber males three to one.

Aslan have a single highly specialized dewclaw that folds into
a horny covering along the interior of the thumb and palm when
not in use.

An individual Aslan is usually a member of a family of two to twelve
individuals under a patriarchal leader. Several families will
combine into a pride with one family dominant. A number
of prides form a clan, again with a top pride. Aside from

CHARACTER CREATION CCHARACTERHARACTER C CREATIONREATION

military organizations and the ruling council, the clan is the highest
socio-political organization among the Aslan.

A deep-seated territorial instinct causes the Aslan to have an
inordinate (from a Human standpoint) drive to own property. For
male Aslan, owning land is a major goal in life. An Aslan's stature is
determined by the amount of land he (or her husband, for females)
controls, or by the amount of land owned by any higher lord the
Aslan may be vassal to. The lowest classes of Aslan society are
landless and provide the farmers, labourers, craftsmen and factory
workers. A holder of a large territory will often grant authority over
it to vassals (usually sons, brothers or male relatives by marriage)
who administer the land in his name.

The sexes have very different roles in Aslan society. Males in all but
the lowest classes are concerned mostly with military operations,
acquisition of territory, and political affairs. Females are concerned
with trade, industry, and the accumulation of knowledge.

A typical Aslan mercenary unit will be organised by a wealthy
married female, who will then assign its operation, for a share of the
proceeds, to an unmarried female relative. The battle commander
and most of the troops will be unmarried males (many of them also
relatives) hired with the promise of land grants (and the opportunity
to gain honor and reputation in combat); however, staff, operations,
supply and intelligence offi cers will generally be female.

Aslan have Notable Strength (+2), Weak Dexterity (–2) and a Natural Aslan have Notable Strength (+2), Weak Dexterity (–2) and a Natural
Weapon (claw). They have an additional characteristic called Territory Weapon (claw). They have an additional characteristic called Territory
which they sometimes use in social interaction with each other.which they sometimes use in social interaction with each other.

DROYNE
Droyne are an intelligent major race inhabiting scattered worlds
within an area slightly larger than the region of the current Imperium.
They are a small race derived from winged herbivorous gatherers.
They vary in size depending on caste but generally stand one meter
tall (large workers and warriors can be larger than Humans). The
history of their evolution remains a puzzle because their home
world is not known with certainty.

Droyne society is divided into rigid castes determined when an
individual reaches adolescence. The six castes of the Droyne all
serve different functions within Droyne society. Although identical
at the time of caste selection, caste members develop pronounced
physical and mental differences by maturity. Different genetic
programs are awakened by differences in diet and environment
among the various castes. Young leaders, for instance, experience a
nearly 30% increase in brain size in the fi rst year after casting, drones
develop sexual organs, and so on. The following are descriptions
and defi nitions of the castes:

- Worker: Worker: Manual labour and mundane ordinary activity are the
    province of the worker. Workers are none too smart and are
    temperamentally suited to contentment with ordinary labour
    and subservient tasks.
       - Warrior: Warrior: Trained for combat and possessing comparatively
          well-developed muscles and reflexes, the warrior is the security
          troop, the soldier, the marine and the policeman of the Droyne
          culture. They are common in frontier bases, and less numerous
          in civilised areas.
       - Drones Drones have a variety of purposes in Droyne society. They
          perform a reproductive role which makes them parents
          to Droyne young and they have a role in the ceremonies
          which determine caste. In addition, drones comprise a sort
          of management caste which is responsible for many of the
          routine functions in business, trade and administration.
       - Te c h n i c i a n s Te c h n i c i a n s a r e t h e s c i e n c e - o r i e n t a t e d p o r t i o n o f D r o y n e
          society and are concerned with both research and practical
          implementation of technology.
       - Sport: Sport: Although the caste system of the Droyne is rather
          rigid, the Sport is the deliberately accepted exception to caste
          structure. Sports are special individuals who cross caste lines
          to become individual scouts, messengers, representatives,
          hunters, prospectors, and to take other occupations that require
          individual initiative or separation from Droyne society for long
          periods of time. A Sport is the most encountered Droyne type
          away from a Droyne world.
       - Leaders Leaders are required to manage and direct society. They are
          ultimately responsible for everything that Droyne as a whole do.

CCHARACTERHARACTER C CREATIONREATION CHARACTER CREATION

There is little individual freedom in Droyne society and, as a result,
society and government join into one concept. Workers work,
Leaders lead. All of society is dedicated to continuing the existence
that provides all members with food, shelter and the other amenities
that make life enjoyable. In addition, there is little discord in Droyne
society when things are running smoothly, as each member of society
has its own function to perform. Only when disaster happens is the
harmony strained.

A typical Droyne group consists of a variety of Droyne from
the different castes. There will be many Workers, few Drones
and Leaders, and Technicians and Warriors based on current
needs. Each group will also have several Sports, although they
may not be present; instead they may be occupied with their
own individual tasks.

This is not to say Droyne are mindless. Leaders are quite capable
and responsible; warriors have strategic and tactical senses,
technicians are inventive and clever, but all accept the central group
as the purpose of their lives and work for its benefi t over their own.

HIVERS
Hivers are an intelligent major race with a large federation of their
own. Hivers average 1.5 meters from ground to top of upraised
head. Descended from omnivore gatherer/scavenger stock, they are
among the most alien of the major races from a human standpoint.
Hivers exhibit a modifi ed six-fold radial symmetry; six limbs equally
spaced around a roughly circular central body.

The head is a modifi cation of one of the limbs and contains six
eyestalks and six manipulative tentacles, plus paired infra-red
sensory organs. The other five limbs are identical (except for slight
modifi cation of the hand opposite the head) and are used as arms
and legs indiscriminately. Each limb ends in a six-fi ngered radial
hand. Fingers are very flexible and have muscular suction cups
on the lower surface about half-way to the tips. Hiver arms and
legs are generally weaker than a human's but are very tough and
diffi cult to injure.

A digestive opening is on the lower surface of the body. Hivers have
no way of producing vocal sound but do have three ears placed
around the neck near the head.

Hivers have only one sex. Reproductive cells are exchanged each
time Hivers meet, using the modified rear hand (the process has
been termed by humans 'shaking hands'). The cells are kept in a
reproductive pouch on the lower body surface where they conjugate
and exchange genetic material. Once every forty days or so a cell
will develop into a larva, which then drops from the parent's body.
Hive planets are mostly wilderness and the larvae enter the wilds
where most are killed. After about a year, any survivors return to

civilization, where they are welcomed into any nest and begin their
education as citizens. Parental instinct in Hivers is very strong and
the entire nest adopts the young. This instinct applies only to the
year-old returnees however; Hivers have no concern for the younger
larvae, and in fact consider them minor pests.

Hiver language is a combination of limb-waving and physical contact.
The written language is ideographic (each symbol represents
a concept) and is used as a standard language among the races
of the Hive Federation. Hivers talking among themselves use all
three aspects of language (gesture, touch and writing) at once,
a process of great subtlety and sophistication but unintelligible
to the outsider.

Hive society is highly individualistic. The term 'Hive' results from
an early Human misconception stemming from the appearance
of the Hivers' buildings and tunnel complexes, which were seen
as resembling a nest of social insects and labelled a hive. Nests
contain from fi ve to fi ve hundred individuals, who are usually
centred around some common endeavor. While one hundred is
an average size for a nest, and was the size in pre-civilised times,
larger groups may come together for some civilised purpose such
as large manufacturing companies or universities. Small nests
are usually spaceship crews or isolated research parties. A young
Hiver will spend his fi rst fi fteen years in his home nest; thereafter,
nest changes may take place as often as a modern human
might change jobs.

Hive industry and business excel at communications technology
and robot construction. Major exports include computer
languages, translators, and sophisticated electronics of all types.
Hiver mathematical systems are much in demand for their
power and elegance.

Major Major racerace is a concept used to classify different alien races. There is some disagreement about what makes a major race and exactly which species are major races. A
major race is generally defi ned as one that developed Jump drive technology (allowing interstellar travel) independently. All races that are not major races are minor races
by default. This is understood to be a somewhat arbitrary distinction and something generally used for promoting the status of ones own race or diminishing another.

CHARACTER CREATION CCHARACTERHARACTER C CREATIONREATION

The Hiver parental instinct was aroused by the discovery of
numerous intelligent species less fortunate than themselves, and
work began immediately to lift the 'children' to civilization. An early
experience with an aggressive race led to the establishment of a
system of quarantined worlds, denied entry to (or knowledge of )
interstellar society.

Covert operations are in progress on quarantine worlds to modify
overly aggressive cultures into acceptable members of the Hive
Federation, and several quarantined planets have been opened since
the beginning of the program. So far, no quarantined race is close to
achieving interstellar travel on its own; public debate continues on
what to do in such a case.

K'KREE
K'kree (once called Centaurs by humans) are among the most
massive of the major races and are the only one of the major races
to be descended from herbivores. An adult K'kree stands about 1.5
meters at the shoulder and between 2.0 and 2.4 meters tall when
standing erect. Weight averages 550 kg. They bear some resemblance
to the centaurs of ancient [[Terra|Terran]] myth, a trait noted by the
earliest human explorers.

The word K'kree comes from their own language, and translates
literally as 'all the nobles', or more broadly, 'the herd'.

The arrangement of the manipulative organ (or hand) on the
front limb is one of their most interesting features. Complex or
cartilaginous tubes permit the fi ngers of the K'kree hand to telescope
out of the way when the hand is used as a weapon. The K'kree
hand is very flexible but somewhat weaker in grasping power than
the human hand.

The K'kree are covered with a short gray or black fur and with a
dense black mane covering the head, neck and upper back of both
sexes. Unlike [[Terra|Terran]] mammals, the young are fed partially digested,
regurgitated food instead of milk. Males average 15 percent to 20
percent larger than females.

K'kree are extremely conservative in all aspects of their culture.
Ceremonial military units (such as bodyguards) are armed with
equipment which K'kree military technology outdated centuries
ago, and (aside from modifi cations made necessary by the
discovery of space fl ight) K'kree government has not changed
signifi cantly in centuries.

Because of their origins as plains-dwelling herd animals, the K'kree
are claustrophobics; they cannot stand to be enclosed. K'kree cities
are clumps of low, broad, buildings; the interior is never more than
one storey in height, which allows the sky to be visible. Internal
building divisions are achieved with curtains or tapestries.

K'kree are extremely gregarious. They are never found alone, and will
quickly sicken and die if removed from other K'kree for any length

of time. Receiving a trade or diplomatic delegation from the K'kree
means entertaining the entire family (one or more wives, servants,
scribes, assistants, and so on) of the merchant or the ambassador.
The K'kree word for 'mine' refers to a possession of an individual's
herd, not to that of an individual. Privacy and individuality are exotic
and little-understood concepts for the K'kree.

K'kree society is divided into castes. The system is a remnant of
ancient times which no longer fits K'kree culture perfectly, but the
K'kree stick with it because it is traditional. There are hundreds
of castes, but the distinctions are too faint for non-K'kree to
understand. For simplicity, castes can be divided into three general
groupings: noble, merchant, and servant. It is possible for a family
to rise in caste, but this is a rare occurrence.

The lowest caste, the servantsservants, has come to include farmers, factory
workers, and unskilled laborers as well as servants for all classes.

The next higher caste, the merchantsmerchants, includes most skilled
workers, scientists, engineers, technicians, scribes, and government
administrators, as well as merchants and businessmen.

NoblesNobles are the governmental offi cials: the high military offi cers,
diplomats, and heads of trade and manufacturing concerns.
Nobles are usually garbed in much more ornate fashion than
the lower castes.

Every male K'kree must serve a term in the military upon coming

CCHARACTERHARACTER C CREATIONREATION CHARACTER CREATION

of age. Warriors are drawn from all castes; rank in the military is
determined by the caste of origin (nobles enter the service as general
offi cer trainees, merchants as lower officers and noncommissioned
offi cers, and servants make up the grunt troops). Upon completing
the required term of service, a warrior returns to his original
caste and position. Warriors are the only K'kree permitted to bear
weapons, and they are further distinguished by their peculiar flared
and horned helmets. They serve as soldiers, police, firefi ghters, and
bodyguards for diplomatic and mercantile expeditions.

Female K'kree are casteless, and take on the caste of their father or
husband. Females have no position in government or society other
than the rearing of young.

VARGR
Vargr are an Intelligent Major Race derived from Ancient genetic
manipulations of [[Terra|Terran]] carnivore/chaser stock, apparently dating
from approximately the same time that humanity was scattered to
the stars.

Inhabiting a region rimward of the Imperium, the Vargr were for
years a puzzle to Imperial xenologists. The Vargr biochemistry and
genetic makeup are almost identical with a number of terrestrial
animals, but differ radically from most of the flora and fauna
indigenous to Lair, the purported Vargr home world. Researches
during the early years of the Third Imperium concluded them to be
the result of genetic manipulation of transplanted [[Terra|Terran]] animals
of the family Canidae, almost certainly of genus Canis. The obvious
conclusion, supported by archeological evidence, is that the race
known as the Ancients was responsible.

Physically, the Vargr are not very impressive. The typical Vargr is
about 1.6 meters in height and weighs approximately 60 kilograms.
They have approximately the same physical parameters as humans
and are able to use the same equipment without modification or
additional instruction. On average their reactions are slightly faster
than those of the typical human, but individuals vary widely. The
Vargr senses of smell and sight are superior to those of humans.

There is no central Vargr government; indeed, there is no
governmental type that can be said to be 'typically Vargr'. Every
conceivable form of governmental organization can be found
somewhere in the Vargr Extents. The only cohesive force in the
Extents is a fi erce racial pride which causes a slight tendency towards
racial cooperation. The higher the level of the Vargr government, the
more unstable it becomes because of the difficulty of obtaining the
consent of all Vargr involved.

Centralised authority is extremely limited at the upper levels of Vargr
society, and action is based on broad coalitional concerns, with a

constant splitting and rejoining of dissident factions. Traditionally,
this has made it very difficult for more centralised and organized
societies such as the Imperium to deal on a meaningful basis with
what passes for Vargr states. The Vargr have little respect for formal
authority, decreasing as that authority becomes more remote. Vargr
generally have more respect for more informal authority figures, and
are more likely to obey superiors who are better known to them.

The Vargr have an intense racial pride and are easily insulted.
They are prone to enter into fights without regard to possible
consequences. Even among the most stable Vargr governments a
highly charismatic leader can attract followers for almost anything.

ZHODANI
Zhodani are independently descended from human stock
transplanted by the Ancients. In general, they tend to be taller than
Solomani or Vilani (other independent branches of the human
'tree') and lithe of build. Averaging 2.0 meters in height and massing
upwards of 90 kilograms, they tend to be swarthy in complexion and
dark-haired. Their most important difference is the acceptance and
use of psionics. Zhodani nobles often wear a turban-like head-dress
which serves to accentuate their height.

CHARACTER CREATION CCHARACTERHARACTER C CREATIONREATION

Zhodani society is divided into three hereditary groups:

- Nobles Nobles are the enfranchised ruling class. They perform all high
    governmental functions, and receive extensive psionic training
    from childhood.
- Intendants Intendants are the managers and administrators of society.
    They comprise most business executives, military officers
    below the ranks of admiral or general, and fill most non-elective
    governmental positions. Intendants are rewarded for great
    diligence, service to the state, or victory in the psionic games,
    with the grant of a noble title.
- Proles Proles (or proletarians) constitute the masses, are forbidden
    the use of psionics, and do not receive training. Proles include
    all members of the military below offi cer grade, most merchants
    and scouts, supervisory and junior management personnel,
    technicians, craftsmen, and labourers.

There is no upward mobility for proles unless psionic powers are
detected in them as children, in which case they will be inducted
into the intendant class. Intendants who perform well in their
positions can be elevated into the ranks of the nobility. In this way,
proles can have some hopes for an improved lot for their children,
intendants are encouraged to strive hard, and there is a constant
infusion of new blood into the nobility. Extensive psionic ability
among the ruling classes permits the Zhodani government to weed
out subversives early in life, and re-educate them as useful members
of society. With rare exceptions, Zhodani are extremely patriotic.
Zhodani citizens possess a high degree of personal honesty.
Indeed, the Zhodani feel uncomfortable in most places outside the
Consulate, where 'liars and thieves are allowed to wander around
loose'. Privacy of thoughts is highly respected among the Zhodani
upper classes, although proles have no such right. Nobles have
almost complete right of personal privacy, and intendants nearly
as much. Rights of foreign nationals vary with whatever treaty is in
effect between the Consulate and the foreign power. The treaty with
the Imperium is unclear in its protections. Most visitors have no
protections for mental privacy, but diplomatic personnel and some
selected commercial representatives are provided visas which allow
psionic shields to be worn.

The Zhodani have a general distaste for other human races which
do not practice psionics. Effective indoctrination and ever-present
possibility that one's mind is being read have removed dishonesty
and deviance as common features of society. Disagreements still

occur, competition thrives, passions flare. But all takes place in
an atmosphere of honesty and truth. Individuals can express their
feelings without fear and problems are openly dealt with. In non-
psionic societies, much is kept secret within the mind. A Zhodani
visiting the Imperium would be appalled by the deviousness and
dishonesty that pervades society.

Imperial distaste for the Zhodani is based on two facts. First, the
Zhodani practice psionics, and an Imperial cannot be sure that a
Zhodani is not invading his mental privacy at any time. Second,
because of their psionic abilities, the Zhodani have the most
effective authoritarian rule in history. Imperial citizens, used to a
great degree of local autonomy, fear Zhodani conquest because of
the loss of freedom it would entail.

Zhodani intendants and nobles are Psionic.Zhodani intendants and nobles are Psionic.

SKILLS AND TASKS

### SSKILLSKILLS ANDAND T TASKSASKS

Most of the actions undertaken by characters do not require a
skill check. A player does not have to roll Athletics to run through
a forest, or roll Computers to access information from his ship's
library. Some actions will require the character to have a particular
skill, but will still not require a roll. A character with Flyer 0 can fly an
air/raft under normal conditions without having to make a roll.

The Referee should only call for checks:

- When the characters are in danger.
- When the task is especially diffi cult or hazardous.
- When the characters are under the pressure of time.
- When success or failure is especially important or interesting.

The most common forms of task checks are characteristic checks
and skill checks.

Characteristic Check:Characteristic Check: These checks are used when the task is one
not covered by an obvious skill, or where the character's innate
abilities are the most important influence on the result. To make a
Characteristic check, roll 2d6 and add the appropriate characteristic
Dice Modifi er. For example:

- When forcing open a sealed door on a derelict ship, a character
    would use his Strength Dice Modifi er.
- When balancing on a narrow beam, a character uses his
    Dexterity Dice Modifi er.
- When trying to endure a long trek through the desert, a character
    would use his Endurance Dice Modifi er.
- When trying to decipher an alien puzzle-box, a character uses
    his Intelligence Dice Modifi er.
- When attempting to remember some trivia or piece of common
    knowledge, a character uses his Education Modifi er.
- When trying to impress a guard with his wealth or position, a
    character uses his Social Standing Dice Modifi er.

Skill Check: Skill Check: For a skill check, the character adds both his skill level
and an appropriate characteristic DM. The combination of skill and
characteristic varies depending on the situation:

- Shooting a gun would use the appropriate Gun Combat sub-
    skill and the character's Dexterity Dice Modifi er.
- Repairing a damaged gun might use Gun Combat and
    Education.
- Tr y i n g t o w o r k o u t w h a t s o r t o f g u n c a u s e d a p a r t i c u l a r w o u n d
    might use Gun Combat and Intelligence (or Investigation and
    Intelligence).
- Hiding from an enemy soldier would call for Dexterity and
    Stealth, while staying still for a long time to avoid detection
    would be an Endurance plus Stealth check.
       - Just generally carousing at a party might use Carouse on its
          own, without any particular characteristic. If the character
          wants to beat someone in a drinking contest, then he might
          use Endurance + Carouse; spotting who is out of place at a
          party would be Intelligence + Carouse, and snubbing someone
          might use Social Standing + Carouse.

In general, skills can be matched to any appropriate characteristic
depending on the situation at hand. Certainly you will roll Dexterity
and Gun Combat more often than Social Standing and Gun Combat
but you never know what might come up.

When making a skill check, if a character does not have any levels in
that skill, then he suffers a –3 unskilled Dice Modifi er.

To r e p e a t ; to make a skill check, a character rolls 2d6 + his Skill to make a skill check, a character rolls 2d6 + his Skill
Level + his Characteristic DM + any other DMs, and tries to get 8 or Level + his Characteristic DM + any other DMs, and tries to get 8 or
more. more. Anything more than this is detail that can be used or not as
the group sees fi t.

Examples:
Yu r i ( I n t e l l i g e n c e 9 , M e d i c 2 ) i s t r y i n g t o a p p l y fi r s t a i d t o a w o u n d e d
ally. First Aid uses his Intelligence DM of +1, plus his Medic skill
level of 2 for a total DM of +3. Yuri's player rolls 2d6 and adds 3. If
the total is 8 or more, then he has successfully applied fi rst aid.

Kathya (Dexterity 10, Stealth 0), Erik (Dexterity 6, Stealth 2) and
Morn (Dexterity 12, no Stealth) are all trying to sneak down a
corridor. Kathya has a +1 Dexterity DM, and while she gets no DM
from only having level zero Stealth, she at least avoids the unskilled
penalty. Her fi nal total DM is +1; she rolls 2d6+1 and tries to get 8
or more. Erik has a Dexterity DM of +0, but has level 2 Stealth. His
final total DM is +2; he rolls 2d6+2 and tries to get 8 or more. Morn
is more dexterous than either of his companions, with his Dexterity
DM of +2. However, he has no Stealth skill at all, and so suffers a –3
DM for being unskilled. His final total DM is –1, so he rolls 2d6–1
and tries to get 8 or more.

Task Difficulties
SimpleSimple tasks are trivial for everyone. A simple task might be
requesting weather data from a standard tourist computer system,
ordering a meal in a language you know well, or sneaking up on a
drugged guard. Simple tasks have a diffi culty DM of +6+6.

EasyEasy tasks are trivial for a trained professional, and simple for an
amateur. An easy task might be hiking cross-country for a few hours,
holding a ship in perfectly level flight, or activating an unfamiliar
device that has a clear and simple interface. Easy tasks have
a DM of +4+4.

A routineroutine task is trivial for a trained professional, and relatively easy
even for an amateur. A routine task might be hitting a prone victim

in melee, landing a ship in optimum conditions with computer
assistance, translating a newspaper and so on. Routine tasks have
a diffi culty DM of +2+2.

An averageaverage task is a moderate obstacle to a trained professional.
Shooting a gun accurately at range, plotting the jump calculations
for a starship, repairing a damaged circuit board or finding a buyer
for a cargo bay full of machine parts on an industrial world are all
examples of average tasks, which have a diffi culty DM of +0.+0.

A diffi cultdiffi cult task is diffi cult even for a trained professional. Examples
might be making an accurate shot in the middle of a ferocious storm,
defending a client in court when he is clearly guilty, hacking into a
secure computer network, or spotting the fl ash of sunlight reflecting
off a sniper's scope. Diffi cult tasks have a diffi culty DM of –2–2.

Very diffi cultVery diffi cult tasks are hard for a trained professional, and nearly
impossible for an amateur. They have a DM of –4.–4.

FormidableFormidable tasks are exceptionally hard, such as performing surgery
in zero-gravity in a ship that is under attack, hacking a military-grade
computer network, disarming a terrorist bomb, or convincing a city
of superstitious natives that you are a peaceful trader and not a
demon from the outer darkness when you don't speak a word of
their language. Formidable tasks have a difficulty DM of –6–6.

TASK DIFFICULTY DICE MODIFIERS

Diffi cultyDiffi culty DMDM
Simple +6
Easy +4
Routine +2
Average +0
Diffi cult –2
Very Diffi cult –4
Formidable –6

For example, Erik (Int 9, Carouse 1) is trying to fi nd information
about a mysterious ship that landed at the starport. He goes to a bar
frequented by travellers and spacers, hoping to pick up on a rumor.
This is a Carouse check, and the Referee says that it is a Difficult
(–2) task. Erik has one level of Carouse, which gives him a DM of
+1, an Intelligence of 9 (for another +1 DM) and he subtracts –2 for
the diffi culty of the task, giving him a final DM of +0. He rolls 2d6 +
0 and tries to get 8 or more.

Situational Modifiers
If a character has help, such as good tools, competent aids or other
benefi cial circumstances, he receives a +1 DM to his skill check.
Characters can choose instead to use riskier task chains (see
page 51) to give other characters bigger Dice Modifiers by linking
skill checks together.

Calling For Task Checks
Often, if the characters have the requisite skills the Referee can
just assume they succeed. For example, if the characters are
trying to fi nd an informant in a city you could keep calling for
Streetwise or Carouse checks until the characters succeed, but
that's dull. It's just the players rolling dice until they can move
on. However, if failure carries a consequence – say, a failed check
will result in the characters picking up a false rumor – then it's
a good time to call for a skill check.

Which Characteristic?
The characteristic that applies to a skill check will be obvious
in most cases – balancing atop a wall is patently a Dexterity-
based check, while using brute force to disable a mechanism
is governed by Strength. The main area of overlap is between
Intelligence and Education. The former covers inspiration,
improvization and pure reasoning, while the latter is for trained
responses and known solutions. For example, a brilliant but
unschooled mechanic might fix a ship using Intelligence and
Engineering, while a trained mechanic might follow the procedure
in the book by rolling Education and Engineering. Some checks
can be attempted with either characteristic, but no amount of
Education will help you deal with a totally unfamiliar problem,
and no amount of Intelligence will let a character know some
piece of trivia or technical information unless he has learned it.

Probability of Success
The probability of rolling 8 or more on 2d6 without modifi ers is
41.67%. The table below shows the probability of success after
all Dice Modifi ers have been applied, as a guide for how likely
the character is to succeed at a skill check.

Oort CloudOort Cloud
A spherical shell around most stars, containing numerous small bodies of cometary material. A typical Oort cloud is about 0.5 to 1 light year from its primary and has an
aggregate mass about that of Earth; density is thus extremely low. The main constituents of cometary bodies are ice and dust ('dirty snowballs'). Bodies in the Oort cloud
are occasionally perturbed by collisions or by the influence of nearby stars into orbits which pass near the star; these form the visible comets.

Effect
If the degree of success is important, then subtract 8 from the
total of the dice roll plus Dice Modifiers. This margin of success is
referred to as the Effect. For example, if a player rolls a 4 and 3, and
has a +3 DM for a total of 10, then his Effect is 10 – 8 = 2.

SUCCESS

Effect TotalEffect Total SuccessSuccess
0 Marginal Success: Marginal Success: The character barely succeeds
at the task, and may have to accept a condition on
his success. He fi xes the engine but it will overheat.
He fi nds a buyer for the goods but the buyer is a
untrustworthy criminal.
1–5 Average Success:Average Success: The character succeeds normally.
6+ Exceptional Success:Exceptional Success: The character succeeds in an
impressive and elegant fashion.

FAILURE

Effect TotalEffect Total FailureFailure
Less than –6 Exceptional Failure: Exceptional Failure: The character failed as
completely as it is possibly to fail. Anything that
can go wrong goes wrong. If attempting to repair
a device, the device is further damaged or even
destroyed. In a social situation, the character gets
into further trouble.
–2 to –5 Average Failure:Average Failure: The character has failed the task.
–1 Marginal Failure: Marginal Failure: The character has almost,
almost succeeded, and the Referee may permit
him to scrape a success if he takes a significant
consequence. A character trying to jump across a
chasm hangs onto the far side by his fingernails but
can only pull himself up if he drops his backpack.
A character trying to land a ship can bring it down
safely but the ship may never fly again. A character
hacking a computer gets in but the security
programs can trace his location.

Timing
Each task has a time frame of one to six time units. The unit
depends on the task – shooting someone or throwing a punch
takes 1–6 seconds, while prepping an air/raft for flight might
take 1–6 minutes, looking for rumors on the street might take
1–6 hours, and repairing a damaged component on a ship might
take 10–60 hours.

rows on the Time Frames table. Moving up (reducing the time
increment) gives you a –1 DM for every row you move; moving
down and increasing the time taken gives you a +1 DM for every
row you move.

For example, Kathya is trying to fix a damaged jump engine in the
middle of a battle. Repairing the engine would normally take 1–6
hours, but an enemy ship is closing fast and they need to jump as
soon as possible. Kathya therefore decides to increase the difficulty
and suffer a –1 DM to reduce the time by one step. Instead of 1–6
hours, it will only take 10–60 minutes.

The ship jumps successfully, but the engine needs more repairs. A
week later, when they emerge from hyperspace, Kathya overhauls
the engine. This time, there is no time pressure, so she opts to
increase the time taken from 1–6 hours to 10–60 hours (two steps)
to make the task easier, giving her a +2 DM.

Multiple Actions
A character can try to do two or more things at once, like firing a
spacecraft's weapons while also flying, or disarming a bomb while
hiding from guards. For every extra thing that the character is doing,
he suffers a –2 DM to all skill checks.

Opposed Checks
If two characters are opposing each other directly in a task, then the
character who obtains the highest Effect wins.

Aiding Another Character
Often, Tr a v e l l e r characters will fi nd themselves working as a group,
or performing a series of interlinked tasks. Finding a buyer for a
cargo of illegal goods, for example, calls for a Streetwise check to
find such a buyer, then a Broker check to negotiate a price. When
coming up with a plan to attack a fortress, the characters would
begin with a Recon check to scope the place out, then a Tactics check
to fi nd weak spots in its defences, then Stealth and Electronics rolls
to get past the security system.

The result of one check can give a DM to the next.

For example, Erik and Kathya are trying to locate a hidden base on
an icy moon. Erik has Engineer (electronics), and suggests trying
to augment their ship's scanners. Kathya has the Sensors skill,
and stays on the bridge while Erik goes down to the sensor pods
with his toolkit.

Firstly, Erik makes his Engineer (electronics) check. He gets an
Effect of 5, which gives a +1 DM to the next task in the chain. Kathya
will make her Sensors check with a +1 DM thanks to Erik's efforts.

Chains of linked task checks can be formed.

SKILLS
Each Skill is described using the following format:
Description: Description: What the skill does.
Specialities: Specialities: If the skill has several specialities, they are listed here.
When a character reaches level 1 in a skill, he can take a speciality in
that skill. When he gains another level in the skill, he may increase
that speciality to level 2, or take a different speciality. Some skills
have no specialities.
Common Checks: Common Checks: Common uses for the skill, and what time
increment, characteristic DM and diffi culty are associated with
those uses.

Admin
This skill covers bureaucracies and administration of all sorts,
including the navigation of bureaucratic obstacles or disasters. It
also covers tracking inventories, ship manifests and other records.

Avoiding close examination of papers: Education or Social Standing,
10–60 seconds, Average (+0).
Dealing with police harassment: Education or Social Standing,
10–60 minutes, Diffi cult (–2).

Skill Levels and What They Mean
This information is also presented in the chapter on character
generation but is repeated here for clarity.

If a character has no level in a skill, then he is untrained and will
suffer a –3 Dice Modifi er when trying to use that skill.

If a character has zero level in a skill (Skill 0), then he is competent
in using that skill, but has little experience. He does not get any
bonus from his skill ranks when using that skill but at least he
avoids the penalty for being untrained.

If a character has one or more level in a skill (Level 1, Level 2,
and so on) then he is trained in that skill. Each rank represents
several years of experience using that skill. A character with Level
2–3 in a skill is a skilled professional in that fi eld. A character with
Medic 2 could be a doctor; a character with Medic 4 is a famous
surgeon or specialist.

Some skills have specialities – specialized forms of that skill. A
character picks a speciality when he gains level 1 in a skill with
specialities. For example, a character might have Engineer 0,
allowing him to make any Engineer skill checks without an
unskilled penalty. He might then gain a level in Engineer, giving
him Engineer (Jump drives) 1. He would make all Engineer
checks involving Jump drives at a +1 DM, but would make all
other Engineer checks at a +0 DM. A character can have multiple
specialities in a skill – an engineer might have Engineer (Jump
drives) 1 and Engineer (power plant) 2. He would make checks
related to Jump drives with a +1 DM, checks related to power
plants with a +2 DM and all other Engineer checks with a +0 DM.

Advocate
Advocate gives a knowledge of common legal codes and practises,
especially interstellar law. It also gives the character experience in
oratory, debate and public speaking, making it an excellent skill for
lawyers and politicians. See also Law Level, page 173.

Arguing in court: Intelligence, Education, or Social Standing, 1–6
days, Average (+0), Opposed.
Debating an argument: Intelligence, 10–60 minutes, Average (+0).

Animals
This skill, rare on industrialised or technologically advanced worlds,
is for the care of animals.

- Riding: Riding: The character knows how to ride an animal who is
    trained to bear a rider. Unusual mounts raise the difficulty of
    the check.
Riding a horse into battle: Dexterity, 1–6 seconds, Diffi culty
    (–2). If successful, the character can control the horse for a
    number of minutes equal to his Effect before needing to make
    another check.
- Veterinary: Veterinary: The character is trained in veterinary medicine and
    animal care.
Applying medical care: See the Medic skill on page 56. Vets
    can treat humans or other non-animal living things as a Very

- Farming: Farming: The character can grow and harvest crops and raise
    animals.

Athletics
The character is a trained athlete and is physically fit. The Athletics
skill effectively augments a character's physical characteristics:
there is never an untrained penalty for not having the Athletics skill,
you just use your Strength, Dexterity or Endurance DM as normal.
Likewise, where a situation might call for a Strength, Dexterity or
Endurance check you can always use the appropriate Athletics
speciality to boost your roll.

SpecialitiesSpecialities

- Co-ordination: Co-ordination: Climbing, juggling, throwing.
Climbing: Dexterity, 10–60 seconds, Diffi culty varies. So long as
    he succeeds, the character's Effect is usually irrelevant unless
    he is trying to do something while climbing, in which case the
    climbing is part of a task chain or multiple action.
Sprinting: Dexterity or Strength, 1–6 seconds, Average (+0). If
    a character does nothing (including react) but sprint flat-out he
    can cover 24 + Effect meters with every check. Avoiding obstacles
    while sprinting requires another Athletics (co-ordination) check
    with the –2 DM for multiple actions.
High jumping: Dexterity or Strength, 1–6 seconds, Average
    (+0). The character jumps a number of meters straight up

equal to the Effect halved.
Long jumping: Dexterity or Strength, 1–6 seconds, Average
(+0). The character jumps a number of meters forward equal to
the Effect with a running start.

- Endurance: Endurance: Long-distance running, hiking.
Long-distance running: Endurance, 10–60 minutes, Average (+0).
- Strength: Strength: Feats of strength, weight-lifting.
Feats of strength: Strength, 10–60 seconds, Average (+0).
- Flying: Flying: Species that fly gain this skill for free at level 0. It covers
    aerobatics, conservation of energy, precise landings and other
    elements of self-powered flight.
Flying through a narrow gap at speed: Dexterity, 1–6 seconds,
    Average (+0). More speed means higher diffi culty.

Art
The character is trained in a type of creative art.

Performing a play: Education, 1–6 Hours, Average (+0).
Convincing a person that you are actually someone else:
    Intelligence, 1–6 Minutes, Diffi cult (–2). The target's Intelligence
    DM is applied as a negative DM to your roll (so a target with an
    Intelligence DM of +1 gives you a –1 DM and a target with an
    Intelligence DM of –2 gives you a +2 to your roll).
- Dance: Dance: The character is trained dancer and performer.
Performing an alien dance to show appreciation of their culture:

Battle Dress
This skill permits the character to operate the advanced battle
armor used by the Imperium. Normally, a character does not need
to make checks using this skill to use the armor – just possessing
levels in the skill is enough – but it can sometimes be used for other
things such as maintenance and identification. See battle dress,

Jack of All Trades
The Jack of All Trades skill works differently to other skills. It
reduces the unskilled penalty a character receives for not having
the appropriate skill by one for every level of Jack of All Trades. For
example, if a character does not have the Pilot skill, he suffers a –3
DM to all Pilot checks. If that character has Jack of All Trades 2, then
that penalty is reduced by 2 to a –1 DM. With Jack of All Trades 3, a
character can totally negate the penalty for being unskilled.

There is no benefi t for having Jack of All Trades 0 or Jack of All Trades
4 or more.

Language
There are numerous different Language specialities, each one
covering reading and writing a different language. All characters can

month. Unlike other skills with specialties, levels in the Trade skill
do not grant the ability to use other specialties at skill level 0. Each
specialty must be learned individually. Someone with a Trade skill
of 0 has a general grasp of working for a living but little experience
beyond the most menial jobs.

Example Trades include:

- Biologicals: Biologicals: Engineering and managing artifi cial organisms.

wearing, he suffers a –2 DM to all skill checks made while wearing a
suit for each missing level.

Zero-G
Having the Zero-G skill means the character is adept at moving
around in micro-gravity environments and freefall. A character

without the Zero-G skill suffers a –2 DM to all checks made in free-
fall. The skill can also be used to move around in a zero-gravity
environment by pushing off other objects or using thruster packs.

The Zero-G skill is also used for operating grav-belts (see page 103).

Complex maneuvers with a grav-belt: Dexterity, 10–60 seconds,
Diffi cult (–2)

LEARNING NEW SKILLS
The more skills a character possesses, the longer it takes him to
learn a new skill. A character's Skill Total is calculated by summing
the levels of each skill (level zero skills count as zero). A character
with Mechanic 1 and Gun Combat (slug pistols) 2 would have a Skill
To t a l o f 3.

To i n c r e a s e a s k i l l , a c h a r a c t e r m u s t t r a i n f o r a n u m b e r o f w e e k s
equal to his current Skill Total plus the desired level of the skill. So,
to advance from Pilot 2 to Pilot 3 with a current Skill Total of 3 would
take (three, plus three) six weeks. A character may only train one
skill in a given week.

The Jack of all Trades skill cannot be learned in play.

COMBAT

### CCOMBATOMBAT

As adventurers journey through the cities and wilds of the worlds
they visit, they will encounter both men and beasts. At times, the
only way such encounters can be dealt with is by force. Combat
in Tr a v e l l e r is designed to be deadly, especially if there is a gap in
technology between combatants.

The combat system is based on the skill system. Firing a gun,
swinging a sword or ordering troops into battle are all skill checks;
respectively, that's Gun Combat, Melee, and Leadership checks.
The main difference between combat and a regular skill check is
that timing and situational awareness play a much bigger part in
combat. Characters will have to move between cover and avoid
being hit by the lethal weaponry common on the battlefields
of the Third Imperium.

Firing a gun, swinging a sword or throwing a grenade are all
combat actions, but a combat action need not be an attack –
jamming communications, giving orders, or applying first aid are
also combat actions.

Setup
If the combatants are all unprepared for combat, then each person
rolls 2d6 and adds their Dexterity DM to determine starting Initiative.
Initiative measures a character's speed, but also his understanding
and control of the battlefield. Initiative determines the order that
characters act in, but it can also be spent to react to events. If
some of the combatants are ready for combat and some are not,
such as in an ambush, the prepared characters are considered
to get an automatic 12 on their roll, giving them an Initiative of
12 + Dexterity DM.

Characters who have the Tactics skill may make a Tactics check and
add the Effect of this check to the Initiative of everyone in their unit.
(Only the highest Tactics Effect in the unit may be used.)

The Referee may prepare detailed maps or even models of
battlefi elds and encounter areas, or just use sketch maps or
descriptions. Tr a v e l l e r uses a scale of 1.5 meters per square for
personal combat.

In most combats, the combatants begin at Medium range. See page
64 for more details about range.

The Combat Round
Each combat round lasts around six seconds of game time. In a
combat round each character gets a minor action and a significant
action. Actions are taken in descending order of Initiative. If
two characters have the same Initiative, the character with the
highest Dexterity goes first. If they are still tied, then characters
act simultaneously. When a character acts, he takes all his
actions at once.

Once everyone has acted a combat round is over and a new round
begins. Initiative is not re-rolled but is dynamic, and may be adjusted
up and down by actions taken during a round.

DYNAMIC INITIATIVE
During the course of a round a character's Initiative score may be
changed by reactions, recoil and hastening. Any changes affect your
Initiative for one round only – either the current round if you have
yet to act or the following round if you have acted already. Reactions
reduce your Initiative in order to allow you to defend yourself from
attacks. Recoil slows you down if you are using a weapon heavier
than you can handle. Hastening your action lets you act sooner but
at a penalty to your roll.

HASTEN
At the start of each combat round a character may declare that he
is acting hastily. This gives him a +2 bonus to his Initiative for that
round only but all his actions receive a –1 DM. A character can
only hasten once.

MINOR ACTIONS

Movement
The character moves up to six meters. Difficult terrain, such as
rubble, mud or thick underbrush can halve a character's movement,
allowing him to move only three meters per movement action.
Crouching also halves movement. Some alien species may have
different methods and speeds of movement which will be detailed
in their description.

Changing Stance
A character can change to any one of the three stances – prone,
crouched or standing – as a minor action.

Drawing and Reloading
The time taken to draw a weapon depends on its size and ease of

Action Summary
In every round a character may make:

- One signifi cant action.
- One minor action.
- As many reactions as he likes.
- As many free actions as he likes, within reason.

The signifi cant action may be broken down into two minor
actions instead, allowing for three minor actions instead of one
signifi cant and one minor.

Red ZoneRed Zone
The Travellers' Aid Society travel zone classifi cation for a nation, world, or system which is dangerous to travellers. In general, the imposition of a red zone classifi cation
indicates the location is quarantined, interdicted by higher authority, or at war. Quarantine indicates that a dangerous disease is present, and the danger of war is self-
explanatory, but interdiction requires further discussion. Interstellar governments often fi nd it necessary to restrict access to worlds or systems for political or military
reasons, and do so by publishing interdictions. Enforcement of interdiction varies with the reason for the restriction. Interdiction may be imposed on a world if it is a
military base or other sensitive installation, for the private reservations belonging to powerful families desiring seclusion, for developing societies which the government
has elected to allow to evolve in isolation, or for valuable resource areas being saved for later development or exploitation.

CCOMBATOMBAT

use. The number of minor actions to ready or reload a weapon is
listed in the description of each weapon. Most weapons take one
minor action to draw and another minor action to reload, but some
weapons are especially fast or slow.

Aiming
A character who spends a minor action aiming at a target gets a
+1 DM to his next attack on the target, as long as the character
does nothing except aim until he makes his attack. A character may
spend multiple actions on aiming, gaining a maximum aiming DM
of +6 if he spends six minor actions on aiming.

Miscellaneous
The Referee may permit a character to perform a skill check or other
action as a minor action if the use of the skill does not require the
character's full attention or complex physical actions. Such minor
actions include:

- Using Recon to spot a good sniping position.
- Keeping control of a vehicle using a vehicle control skill.
- Identifying the type of gun being used by an enemy using Gun
    Combat.
- Picking something up off the ground or a nearby surface.

SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS

Minor Actions
A character can take two minor actions instead of a significant
action.

Miscellaneous
A character may make a skill check or do something else as a
signifi cant action when such an action requires the character's full
attention, concentration, complicated physical actions or some
combination thereof. Such checks include:

- Applying fi rst aid to a wounded comrade using the Medic skill
    (see page 56).
- Tr y i n g t o b y p a s s t h e s e c u r i t y s y s t e m o n a h a t c h u s i n g t h e
    Mechanic skill.
- Using a psychic power (see page 152).
- Issuing orders with the Leadership skill (See page 56).
- Calling in an ortillery strike.
- Performing hazardous maneuvers with a vehicle.

The Referee will adjudicate which skill checks are significant and
which are minor.

Attack
The most common significant action is an attack. The basic attack
action is trying to injure a foe with a melee attack or a ranged
weapon. The attacker declares his target, and the foe may choose
to react (see Reactions, right). The attacker then makes a skill
check, and if successful, deals damage to his target (see Damage,
page 65). As with any other skill check, the standard roll for
success is 8+.

The standard skill checks used in making an attack are:

Melee Attack = 2d6 + Melee (appropriate specialty) + Melee Attack = 2d6 + Melee (appropriate specialty) +
Strength or Dexterity DM (attacker's choice)Strength or Dexterity DM (attacker's choice)

Shooting Attack = 2d6 + Gun Combat (appropriate specialty) or Shooting Attack = 2d6 + Gun Combat (appropriate specialty) or

Melee skill
RECOIL AND HEFT
When you make an attack, compare your Strength DM to the Recoil
rating of the weapon you are using. If your Strength DM is higher, no
further effects apply. If your Strength DM is lower then the difference
is applied to your initiative next round. Melee weapons have a rating
called Heft which works in exactly the same way.

When fi ring automatic weapons in burst mode, increase Recoil
by 1. When fi ring them on full auto increase Recoil by half
the Auto score.

REACTIONS
A character who is about to be attacked can react, dodging or
ducking out of the way. This means that the more time a character
spends reacting, the longer it will be until he acts himself. Each

CCOMBATOMBAT COMBAT

reaction lowers Initiative by 2 and applies a –1 DM to all skill checks
until the following round. There is no limit to how many times a
character can react in a round but a character can only react once to
each attack and the penalties from reacting are cumulative.

A character can only react to attacks that he is aware of.

Dodging
A character who is being attacked may dodge, giving his attacker a
–1 DM and giving himself a –1 DM on all skill checks until the next
round. If the character is in cover or has an obstruction to duck or
dodge behind, the DM to hit him is increased to –2.

Parrying
A character who is being attacked in melee can parry, applying his
Melee skill as a negative DM equal to the attack roll. A parrying
character also has a –1 DM on all skill checks until the next round.

OTHER ACTIONS
This section covers actions with unusual timing, such as performing
a long skill check or interrupting someone else's action.

Free Actions
Some actions are so fast they do not even qualify as a minor action

- shouting a warning, pushing a button, checking your watch,
and so on. A character can perform as many of these free actions

as he likes in a turn, although if he performs several the Referee
may require him to spend a minor or even a significant action
on his various tasks.

Extended Actions
Some skill checks will take longer than a single combat round
to complete. Make a Timing roll for the task (see page 50) and
then work out how many six second combat rounds it will take to
complete. A character engaging in an extended action cannot do
anything else but can abandon their action at any time and return to
the normal Initiative order. A character who is hit by an attack while
undertaking an extended action must make an 8+ roll using the skill
in question with a negative DM equal to the amount of damage
the attack causes (after armor). Failure indicates that this round's
work does not count towards the completion of the task. Failure by
six or more (an Exceptional Failure) ruins the task and the character
must start again.

Delay
A character does not have to act when his turn comes up in the
Initiative order. He may act at any later point during the round, even
interrupting another's actions to do so. When he acts, his Initiative
is set to the count on which he acted. If the character has not acted
by the end of the round he may choose to act fi rst in the next round,
effectively giving up his actions in the previous round in exchange
for an Initiative advantage. His new Initiative is set to one higher
than that of the current first person in the order. When multiple
characters are delaying and all wish to act first in the following
round, their Initiatives are all set to the same score and they act in
Dexterity order as normal.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
These rules cover unusual situations that will not occur in every
firefight.

Automatic Weapons
Automatic weapons – any with a number listed in the Auto column
(see page 97) are capable of three fi re modes: single-shot, burst,
and auto-fi re.

- When using single shots, make attacks as normal.
- When using burst fi re, add the Auto value to the damage. Burst
    fire uses a number of rounds equal to the Auto rating.
- When using auto-fi re, roll a number of dice equal to the Auto
    rating of the weapon and sort them into pairs as you wish. Each
    pair is an attack. Auto-fi re attacks can be allocated to as many
    different targets as you have attacks provided all the targets are
    within six meters of each other. Auto-fi re attacks cannot benefit
    from a skill any higher than level 1. Weapon skills of 2 or higher
    only count as 1 when making auto-fi re attacks. Auto-fi re uses a
    number of rounds equal to 3 the Auto rating.

Battlefield Comms
Communications technology is a vital part of the battlefi eld. If
a character is not in communication with the rest of his unit

COMBAT CCOMBATOMBAT

and his commander, then he cannot benefi t from Tactics or
Leadership. Characters who benefi tted from Tactics at the start
of combat and are later cut off from their commander have their
Initiative lowered by the same amount it was boosted at the start
of combat. Unlike other Initiative modifi cations, this lasts until
combat ends or communication is re-established. There are
several methods of communication:

- Direct: Direct: This covers hand signals and verbal communications.
    Characters must be within sight or earshot of each other to use
    direct communications.
- Hardlinks: Hardlinks: Hardlinks are wires or other physical connections,
    and cannot be jammed. They can, however, be broken.
- Radio: Radio: Radio communications allow communications as long
    as the radio signal can get through – they can be jammed or
    blocked by local conditions.
- Laser: Laser: Two characters with tight beam lasers are in
    communication as long as line of sight exists between a
    character and another friendly laser-comm equipped character.
    Lasers can be jammed by other laser comms systems in direct
    line of sight, but it is exceedingly difficult. They can also be
    blocked by smoke, aerosols or other obstacles.
- Masers: Masers: These work just like lasers, but can cut through smoke
    and aerosols. Masers can be jammed by other maser comms
    systems.
- Meson: Meson: Meson communicators cannot be jammed or blocked,
    but cannot be used while a character is moving. Re-establishing
    a meson link requires a Comms check.

If several characters are in communication and are working together,
then they can be considered a single unit, and benefit from Tactics
and Leadership.

Battlefield Sensors
There are several types of sensors used on the battlefields of
Tr a v e l l e r. (See Sensors on page 96.)

- Bioscanner: Bioscanner: Bioscanner 'sniffers' detect airborne pathogens
    and hazardous chemicals.
- Infra-Red (Heat): Infra-Red (Heat): Infra-red sensors detect warm bodies, and
    negate concealment from smoke and soft cover, but can be
    jammed by strong heat sources.
- Densitometer: Densitometer: An outgrowth of gravitic technology, a
    densitometer can scan an area and plot variable densities,
    effectively creating a three-dimensional map of all objects. A
    densitometric scan can uncover subterranean structures and
    even detect hidden enemies, but the scan takes several minutes
    to perform and cannot be used in real-time. Densitometers can
    be fooled by multiple objects with similar density (a scan can
    tell an armored soldier from an unarmored civilian, but cannot
    distinguish between a living person and a corpse).
- Electromagnetic Detectors: Electromagnetic Detectors: These sensors can detect
    unshielded high-power electrical devices, such as gauss
    weapons or transmitters.
       - Laser-Assisted Targeting: Laser-Assisted Targeting: A low-powered laser is reflected off
          the target, giving targeting data to the firer. Laser-Assisted
          Ta r g e t i n g s y s t e m s g i v e n o b o n u s a g a i n s t f o e s w e a r i n g R e fl e c.
          See Laser Sight, page 102.
       - Light Intensifi cation: Light Intensifi cation: Light intensifi cation technology magnifies
          visible light, negating the penalties for darkness or low light.
       - Motion Sensors: Motion Sensors: Can detect motion within range.
       - Neural Activity Sensor: Neural Activity Sensor: A combination of highly sensitive EM-
          detectors and psionic theory, NAS detectors pick up on the
          brain activity of living beings and classifies them according to
          amount and complexity, giving a rough idea of the intelligence
          of subjects.

A character need only make a Sensors check when using a bioscanner,
densitometer, EM-detector or NAS detector. Infra-red scanners and
motion scanners need Sensors checks to interpret confusing data,
such as trying to distinguish human thermal signatures in the midst
of a burning building, or when trying to pick up on extremely faint
traces like residual heat from a footprint.

Conditions
Certain battlefi eld conditions affect ranged attacks:

- Darkness: Darkness: Low light gives a –1 DM to ranged attacks. Complete
    darkness gives a –4 DM. Light penalties can be avoided by
    using sensors to target instead of the naked eye.
- Smoke or Fog: Smoke or Fog: Smoke gives a –1 DM to ranged attacks by
    obscuring the target; especially thick and impenetrable smoke
    gives a –2 DM. These penalties are doubled for laser weapons.
- Extreme Weather: Extreme Weather: Driving wind, rain, snowstorms and so forth
    give a –1 DM to ranged attacks from poor visibility and a –1 DM
    to ranged attacks from environmental interference. Sensors
    can be used to avoid the visibility penalty.

Cover
Any sort of low wall, undergrowth, convenient rocks or other objects
can serve as cover. Attacks made on characters who are behind
cover suffer the negative cover DM on the table below. Crouching
or prone targets (see overleaf ) can claim cover one step higher on
the table. If a character in full cover is crouching or prone they are
impossible to hit but cannot return fi re – if they expose themselves
enough to shoot then they are exposed enough to be shot.

CoverCover Cover DMCover DM
1/4 (undergrowth, small rock, corner of a building) –0
1/2 (thick forest, low wall, crate) –1
3/4 (jungle, trench, reinforced position) –2
Full (pillbox) –4

Cover can be hard or soft. Soft cover such as undergrowth works by
concealing the character using the cover and does not protect against
attacks from enemies who can see through the concealment, such
as those using thermal sensors. Hard cover is a physical barrier and
will protect against all attacks.

CCOMBATOMBAT COMBAT

Explosions
Grenades, rockets and other explosives affect an area. A character
caught in an explosion may dodge at the usual Initiative cost (or, if
the explosion happens outside combat, if the character is in position
to dodge). A character who dodges an explosion may reduce the
damage by 1d6 if he just dodges or by half if he dives for cover.
A character who dives for cover ends up prone and loses his next
signifi cant action (he may take minor actions as normal).

Firing into Combat
If a character is fi ring a weapon at a target who is at Personal range
to another combatant, then the attack suffers a –2 DM. If the attack
misses, roll 1d6. On a 4+, the attack hits the nearest other combatant
to the original target.

Grappling
A character can attempt to wrestle or grab another person instead
of hitting him. The attacker must move to Personal range and beat
his target in an opposed Melee (unarmed) check. If he wins, he may
do any one of the following:

- Knock his opponent prone.
- Disarm his opponent. If he succeeds by 6+ he can take the
    weapon away; otherwise it ends up on the floor.
- Throw his opponent up to three meters for 1d6 damage.
- Inflict damage equal to 2 + the Effect.
- Escape the grapple and move away (as if with a normal
    movement action).
- Continue the grapple with no other effects.
- Drag his opponent up to three meters.

Throwing an opponent always ends the grapple. With any other
option the winner can choose to end or continue the grapple as he
sees fi t. A character in a grapple cannot move or do anything other
than make opposed Melee checks. Each time an opposed check is
made the winner can choose an option from the above list.

Range
Personal combat is divided into a series of range bands:

Range Range

Distance to Distance to
Ta r g e t Ta r g e t

Squares to Target (for use Squares to Target (for use
with maps and miniatures) with maps and miniatures)
Personal Less than 1.5
meters

0 (combatants are in the same
square)
Close 1.5 to 3 meters 1 to 2 squares
Short 3 to 12 meters 3 to 8 squares
Medium 12 to 50
meters

9 to 34 squares

Long 51 meters to
250 meters

35 to 166 squares

Very Long 251 meters to
500 meters

167 to 334 squares

Distant 501 meters+ 334 squares+

Each attack form has an optimum range (or spread of ranges).
Attacks within this range have a +0 DM. Attacks outside the
optimum range suffer a negative DM. Melee attacks can only be
made at Close or Personal range.

Stance
A character can be standing, crouched or prone.

A standing character uses the normal rules. A crouching character
moves at half speed but can make better use of cover. If a crouching
character is in cover, consider it one row lower on the Cover Table
(see previous page) – 1/4 cover counts as 1/2 cover, 1/2 cover as
3/4 cover, and so on.

A prone character cannot make melee attacks or dodge. He may
make improved use of cover like a crouching character and he may
still parry melee attacks. All ranged attacks targeting him suffer
a –2 DM penalty. At Close range, the penalty is reduced to +0; a
prone character being attacked at Personal range grants a +2 DM to
attacks against him.

Tactics and Leadership
These two skills can affect a character's Initiative.

The Tactics skill can be used to give an Initiative bonus to a whole
unit at the start of combat. The unit commander may make a Tactics
check, and everyone in the unit may increase their Initiative by the
Effect of the check.

The Leadership skill can be used to increase another character's
Initiative. The character with Leadership makes a Leadership check,
and the target character's Initiative is increased by the Effect of the
check. Making a Leadership skill check is a signifi cant action.

GettingPersonal
Characters in Personal range of one another tend to get in each
others' way:

- A character may move into Personal range as part of a
    normal movement action but must stop there. They can
    move away again with another movement action.
- A character has a –1 DM to all non-combat skill checks for
    every person within Personal range.
- Many attacks suffer negative DMs when at Personal range;
    see the table opposite.

The exception is when characters co-operate. Two characters
who are co-operating do not give each other penalties to
skill checks and can freely move into and out of each others'
Personal range as part of one movement action. However, third
and additional characters start applying penalties as normal:
two people can work on an access panel in a narrow corridor,
but someone trying to sprint past them is going to make life
diffi cult for everyone.

Amber ZoneAmber Zone
Part of a system used by the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service and the Traveller's Aid Society classifi cation for a nation, world, or system which presents a need for caution
in dealings and activity. The amber code may indicate chaos, upheaval, or xenophobia in local business, politics, society, or culture, or may be applied for other reasons.
Tr a v e l l e r s s h o u l d e x e r c i s e c a u t i o n.

COMBAT COMBAT

Thrown Weapons
There are two kinds of thrown weapons: the fi rst kind strike a
single target and do damage from the force of their impact, such
as throwing knives or a thrown rock. These use the normal rules for
ranged combat. The other kind of thrown weapon is a grenade or
other explosive projectile that inflicts no damage from impact but
typically delivers a harmful payload. The first kind of thrown weapon
adds the Effect of the Athletics (co-ordination) check to its damage.
The second kind does not.

If the attack fails the projectile scatters in a random direction for
(6 + Effect) meters. This is usually only important if the projectile
explodes on or after impact.

DAMAGE
Each weapon lists the damage it inflicts as a number of d6. Add the
Effect of the attack roll to this damage.

Damage is applied initially to the target's Endurance. If a target is
reduced to Endurance 0, then further damage is subtracted from the
target's Strength or Dexterity (target's choice, but all the damage from
a single attack must be subtracted from a single statistic). If either
Strength or Dexterity is reduced to 0, the character is unconscious
and any further damage is subtracted from the remaining physical
characteristic. If all three physical characteristics are reduced to 0,
the character is killed.

COMBAT COMBAT

Armor
Armor reduces damage by the value of the armor. A hit with Effect
6+ always inflicts at least one point of damage, regardless of the
target's armor.

Kathya shoots a foe for 10 damage. If the target was wearing a flak
jacket (armor 2), then the damage would be reduced by 2 to 8. If
the target was wearing battle dress (armor 18), she would inflict
no damage at all.

VEHICLES
Combat in and on vehicles is much the same as ordinary combat.
The differences are as follows:

- Unlike people, who are mobile and manoeuvrable, careful track
    must be kept of which way a vehicle is facing. Vehicle-mounted
    weapons – and armed passengers, to a lesser extent – are
    restricted to certain fi re arcs.
- Vehicles are considered to move on the driver's Initiative. The
    driver must spend a minor action every round to keep control
    of the vehicle under normal circumstances – a straight road
    or simple maneuvers – or a signifi cant action to navigate
    obstacles, conduct evasion or pursuit, or dodge incoming fi re.
- Attackers gain a +1 DM to hit most vehicles because of their size.

Types of Vehicles
There are two main types of vehicles: open and closed. Closed
vehicles include typical cars, g/carriers, tanks and other vehicles
with an enclosed hull. Open vehicles include motorbikes, air/rafts
and other vehicles where the occupants are exposed.

CLOSED VEHICLES

- Closed vehicles grant cover to the occupants – unless the
    description mentions otherwise civilian vehicles grant ½ soft
    cover and military vehicles full hard cover.
- Only a few people in a closed vehicle can shoot out, depending
    on the number of windows or other firing ports and the internal
    space available. Unless the description mentions otherwise up
    to two people can fi re into each arc from a civilian vehicle and
    one person in each arc in a military one.

OPEN VEHICLES

- Open vehicles grant no cover to the passengers.
- Any passenger in an open vehicle can shoot (or otherwise
    attack) in any direction.

Vehicle-Mounted Weapons
Weapons mounted on vehicles follow all the rules for normal
weapons with one addition: fi re arcs. Weapons mounted on vehicles
are limited in what directions they can fire. A weapon mounted in
the front arc, for example, can only fi re into a 90 ̊ area in front of the
vehicle. Weapons in turrets can fire in any direction.

Firing a vehicle-mounted weapon is based on the skill for the weapon
in question – Gun Combat (energy rifle) for a laser turret, Heavy
Weapons (man-portable artillery) for a fusion gun, and so on.

What weapons a vehicle has in what arcs are listed in its
description.

Collisions
When a vehicle collides with something else – a pedestrian, another
vehicle, or obstacle – everything takes damage. Roll 1d6 for every 10
km/h of the vehicle's speed (round up). This is applied as damage
directly to anything hit and, if the thing struck is solid enough, also
to the ramming vehicle. Any unsecured passengers in a vehicle
damaged in a collision take the same damage and, if possible,
are thrown three meters for every 10 km/h of speed. Secured
passengers (those wearing seatbelts or something similar) are not
thrown anywhere and take one quarter damage.

Vehicular Actions
These are all signifi cant actions that the driver of a vehicle can take
when his turn in the initiative order arrives.

Optional Rule: Knockout Blow
If a character's Endurance is reduced from its starting value to
0 by a single attack, the character is knocked out instantly, even
though he still has two characteristics above zero. This is a good
rule to introduce when the characters are facing a large number
of weaker foes.

Optional Rule: Random First Blood
Instead of always applying damage to Endurance first, the
first damage sustained in any combat is applied to a random
physical characteristic, and damage after that can be allocated
by the player to any physical characteristic. This makes a low
Endurance more survivable.

LEFT RIGHT

COMBAT CCOMBATOMBAT

EVASIVE ACTION
Vehicles are not typically manoeuvrable enough to dodge as
a reaction. Instead, the driver may declare that he is taking
evasive action when his turn arrives. He makes a skill check (skill
determined by vehicle) and the Effect acts as a –DM to all attacks
against the vehicle or its passengers. The Effect also acts as a –DM
to any attacks made from the vehicle as well. This lasts until the
driver's next action.

MANOEUVRING
A driver or pilot can maneuver his vehicle without making a skill
check. This allows the vehicle to avoid large or obvious obstacles, to
get where it is going, to move out of one fire arc of an enemy vehicle
and into a different one, or to change the fire arc that a single target
is in. More extreme maneuvers are covered by 'stunt', below.

RAM
Deliberately driving a vehicle into someone or something requires
a signifi cant action and a successful skill check (skill determined
by vehicle). Rams are affected by dodging and evasive action as
normal. The Referee may grant bonuses to a ram attempt or declare
it automatically successful if the target is particularly large.

STUNT
With a signifi cant action and a successful vehicle control check the
driver or pilot of a vehicle can do pretty much anything it is possible
to do in his vehicle – stand a car up on two wheels, perform stunning
aerobatics in a jet plane, or skim a speedboat over a low sandbar. A
stunt can be used to put a single target into one additional fire arc
for one round (putting an enemy vehicle into both your front and
rear arcs by spinning the car, for example), to set up some other
skill check (often allowing passengers to line up weapons) using the
rules for task chains on page 51, to achieve something that would
normally be diffi cult or impossible in your vehicle (driving down
an alley too narrow for your car by flipping it onto two wheels), to
achieve up to three maneuver actions in one go, just to show off,
or anything else you can imagine.

WEAVE
In an environment with many obstacles, such as an inner city or
tight underground caverns, a driver or pilot may choose to weave his
vehicle in and around the obstacles at high speed in order to evade
pursuit. The driver chooses a weaving number, as low as one or as
high as one per 20 km/h of speed (round up), and must then make
a skill check (skill determined by vehicle) with the weaving number
as a penalty on his roll. If he fails, he has woven into an obstacle and
crashed. See Collisions. If he succeeds, any pursuers must choose
a weave action when their initiative count comes up and make their
skill test at the same penalty with the same consequence for failure.
Alternatively, they can choose to break off pursuit and either give up
or try to reacquire the target later.

Vehicle Damage
Vehicles do not have Characteristics like living characters. Instead,
they have a Hull value and a Structure value, which measure the
vehicle's structural integrity. When Hull is reduced to 0, the vehicle
starts taking damage to its internal systems. When Structure is
reduced to 0, the vehicle is reduced to scrap. Vehicles also suffer
damage to onboard systems as they take damage.

how much damage the vehicle suffers as normal. Many vehicles
will have one or more points of armor that reduces the damage.
Consult the Vehicle Damage table to determine how many 'hits' the
vehicle suffers.

HullHull
Reduce the vehicle or drone's Hull by one. If a vehicle runs out of
Hull, further Hull hits become hits on the same row of the Internal
Damage table (if a vehicle) or Structure hits (if a robot or drone).

StructureStructure
Reduce the vehicle or drone's Structure by one. If a vehicle runs out
of Structure, it is destroyed. If the vehicle is destroyed by an attack
that reduces it to a negative Structure score it explodes, doing 4d6
damage to everyone within six meters (including the occupants) and
2d6 damage to everyone within twelve meters. The occupants of a
closed vehicle cannot dodge or dive for cover from this explosion
but the occupants of an open vehicle can.

ArmorArmor
Reduce the vehicle or drone's armor by one.

DriveDrive
First Hit: Reduce movement by 10% and apply a –1 DM to all vehicle
control skill checks.
Second Hit: Reduce movement by 25% and apply a –2 DM to all
vehicle control skill checks.
Third Hit: Drive disabled.
Further drive hits count as Hull hits.

WeaponWeapon
Choose a weapon or device randomly for each hit.
First Hit: The weapon or device suffers a –2 DM to all checks related
to its operation.
Second Hit: The weapon or device is destroyed.
If no weapons remain to be destroyed, further hits on this location
become Hull hits.

SensorsSensors
First Hit: The vehicle or drone suffers a –2 DM to all Sensors checks.
For drones and robots, this also applies to Recon checks.
Second Hit: The sensors are destroyed, blinding the vehicle or
drone.
Further Sensor hits count as Hull hits.

Power PlantPower Plant
First Hit: The vehicle or drone loses one round's worth of actions.
Second Hit: The vehicle or drone's movement is reduced by 50%.
Third Hit: The power plant is destroyed, disabling the vehicle and
inflicting 1d6 Hull hits on it.

First Hit: The limb suffers a –2 DM to all checks related to its
operation.
Second Hit: The limb is destroyed.
Further Limb hits count as Hull hits.

PassengersPassengers
Choose a passenger randomly for any passenger hit. The passenger
takes damage equal to the damage inflicted on the vehicle. If all the
passengers are dead, further passenger hits become Structure hits.

CargoCargo
Any cargo present is hit and may be destroyed. If no cargo
remains, further cargo hits become Structure hits.

CockpitCockpit
The pilot of the vehicle is hit, and takes damage equal to the damage
inflicted on the vehicle. If the pilot is dead, further pilot hits become
Structure hits.

ComputerComputer
First Hit: The vehicle's computer system is disabled. A drone or robot
with a disabled computer system shuts down for 1d6 rounds.
Second Hit: The vehicle's computer system is destroyed. A drone or
robot with no computer system is completely disabled.
Further Computer hits count as Structure hits.

Repairs
Damage to a vehicle or drone falls into three categories – System
Damage, Hull Damage, and Structure Damage.

System Damage: System Damage: A damaged system can be jury-rigged back to
functioning, but it will stop functioning again after 1d6 hours.
Repairing a damaged system requires not only an Average skill
check (Mechanic, Engineer (appropriate speciality) or Science
(appropriate speciality)) taking 1–6 hours but also a source of spare
parts. The spare parts can come from a scrap yard, a workshop,
systems on another vehicle, or can be taken from other systems
on the same vehicle. When taking spare parts from other vehicle
systems, each 'hit' of damage provides enough spare parts to make
a single repair check.

The Passengers and Cockpit systems cannot take hits to provide
spare parts, although cybernetic parts might be able to provide
enough spare material to repair minor damage.

A destroyed system costs 2d6 10% of its original cost to repair, and
cannot be repaired using spare parts. It requires a full workshop and
specialist materials.

Hull Damage: Hull Damage: Hull damage can be repaired with a Mechanic check
taking 1–6 hours and consumes one 'hit' of spare parts.

Structure Damage: Structure Damage: Structure damage can only be repaired in a
workshop and requires 10–60 hours per point of damage. It costs
20% of the base cost of the vehicle per point repaired. No skill check
is required.

ANIMALS
Many worlds in the galaxy are capable of bearing life. While a sizeable
proportion of these worlds were seeded with Earth-life by the Ancients
or by human colonists, there are many worlds where evolution (or
engineering) has produced bizarre creatures. Regardless of their
world of origin or biochemistry, the majority of creatures fall into a
few categories – herbivores, omnivores, carnivores and scavengers.
These categories are further broken down into behaviours, such as
grazer or fi lter. A carnivore that hunts by ambushing its prey will be
a very different encounter to one that hunts as part of a pack.

The terrain of a planet also helps determine what sorts of creatures
are encountered there.

Animals have a similar range of characteristics to humans, but there
are several differences:

Instinct:Instinct: Instinct is the animal equivalent of Education. Animals
apply their Instinct DM to tasks such as sensing prey or solving
problems. A cunning or highly successful creature would have a
high Instinct score.

Pack:Pack: Pack is the animal equivalent of Social Standing. The higher
a creature's Pack score, the larger the group that it is associated
with, and the more standing the creature has in that group. A lone

scavenger would have a low Pack score; a member of a herd would
have a medium Pack, while the alpha of a hunting pack would have
a high Pack score.

Planetary Quirks
For each world, the Referee should decide on a theme or style to
unite the denizens of that world. Just as all mammals or all lizards
on Earth share certain traits, so too do alien creatures of different
types. Are the dominant creatures hot-blooded or cold-blooded, or
do they have some other method of circulation entirely? Perhaps
creatures on this world are hive organisms made up of thousands
of smaller creatures; maybe psionics takes the place of vision, or
perhaps creatures spit acid instead of attacking with claws and
teeth. For some quick quirks, choose one or more columns from
the table below and roll on them to see what unusual features are
common on a given world.

Rural Encounters and Terrains
Worlds are divided into several terrain types, where different species
hold sway. The Referee can roll randomly to determine what the
characters encounter, or build up a whole ecology in advance.

The terrain type affects the nature of the creatures found there.
Animals can be amphibious (A), swimmers (S), fl yers (F) or walkers
(W). If a number is listed in the movement section, it is a DM to the
creature's Size roll.

The Rural Encounter table gives the sort of creature encountered. If
the characters are going to be spending a lot of time on a world, the
Referee should fi ll in a Rural Encounter table for each terrain type
they will be travelling through, replacing the generic creature types
with specifi c species.

DiseaseDisease
Alien diseases can sometimes cross over and infect humans, but most diseases
are of [[Terra|Terran]] origin. The Ancients scattered humans all over the galaxy tens of
thousands of years ago, and they brought bacteria and viruses with them. Over
time, these have mutated into new forms. In the unlikely event that a highly
virulent plague is discovered, the infected world is placed under interdiction until
a cure can be found. Disease outbreaks are especially dangerous on new colony
worlds, which lack the medical expertise and facilities to treat all the patients.

The disease...

1. ... has an incubation period of several days, so symptoms only appear when
    the characters are in jumpspace.
2. ... is a mutated version of an extinct [[Terra|Terran]] plague, like the Black Death.
3. ... stimulates the latent psychic powers of the brain, giving telepathic powers
    while killing the subject.
4. ... can only be cured by an expensive drug, which the characters must import
    from a high-tech world.
5. ... is lethal only to one alien species, causing massive social upheaval on a
    world jointly settled by humanity and that race.
6. ... was deliberately released by hostile forces.

Creature Creation Example, Part 1
The player characters are making their way through a thick
rainforest en route to a crashed starship they want to salvage.
The Referee decides to generate a local wildlife encounter to
make things more interesting. First of all he consults the Terrain
DM Chart and looks at the row corresponding to the terrain the
characters are in – rainforest. Rolling a die for creature movement
he gets a 4, which gives a W for walking movement and a +2 size
DM which negates the –2 DM for being in a rainforest. Next,
he checks the Rural Encounter Table and rolls 2d6. He rolls a 5.
His creature is an omnivore. Rolling 2d6 on the Animal Types
table and applying a –2 Type DM from the rainforest terrain he
gets a 9, –2 is 7. Checking the omnivore column reveals that
his creature is a hunter that stalks and kills easy prey. He notes
down that it has Survival and Instinct +2.

ENCOUNTERS AND DANGERS EENCOUNTERSNCOUNTERS ANDAND D DANGERSANGERS

For each entry in the Rural Encounter Table, roll on the appropriate
column of the Animal types table, modified by the Terrain Type DM
from the Terrain DM Chart.

    trap. Generally, any creature surprised by a trapper is caught in
    its trap. Pack –2.

Creature Sizes and Characteristics
For each creature, roll 2d6 for its Size and apply any Dice Modifiers
from its Terrain or Movement category. The creature's Size
determines its Weight, Strength, Dexterity and Endurance – for
example, a roll of 7 means that the creature has a Strength of 3d6,
an Dexterity of 3d6 and an Endurance of 3d6.

Roll 2d6 separately for the animal's Weapons and Armor. Add a +8
DM when rolling for weapons if the animal is a Carnivore, and a +4
if it is an Omnivore; subtract a –6 DM if the animal is a Herbivore.
Scavengers automatically have Teeth in addition to any other
weapons. If a number is present after the Weapons type, then add
that number to the number of damage dice the creature rolls.

Animal Reactions
Non-domesticated animals usually react to threats or provocation
by either fi ghting or fleeing. When characters disturb an animal or
otherwise draw attention to themselves while within its territory roll
2d6 and consult the following table. If the result is high enough to
indicate an attack, the creature attacks. If the result is low enough to
indicate flight, it flees, although it may return later. If the result on
the table is neither attack nor flee, then the animal stands still until
provoked again, in which case roll again.

4. Apply common sense as required.

Creature Creation Example, Part 2
The Referee rolls on the Size Table, applying the –2 DM from rainforest terrain and the +2 DM he rolled when checking for locomotion.
He rolls an 8, meaning the hunter weighs 200 kg. After rolling its characteristics it comes out Strength 12, Dexterity 11 and Endurance 7.
A powerful creature but with little stamina for a prolonged chase. Rolling on the weapons and armor table the Referee scores 8 and 10
(including a +4 DM on each because the creature is an omnivore). That gives it a stinger with +1 dice of damage (so its final damage is
2d6 (from Strength) + 1d6 (from the sting) = 3d6) and three points of armor. The roll for Pack is low, only a 4, meaning the characters
will only encounter 1d6 of the creatures at a time. The roll for Instinct is a 12! Plus two from the creature's hunter behaviour gives it an
overwhelming Instinct of 14, about as cunning as an animal can get.

After distributing a handful of points among the creature's Survival, Recon and Melee skills the Referee is ready to have his player
characters encounter a nest of them. With an Instinct of 14 the hunters are nearing sophont levels of intelligence, so clearing them out of
the wreckage of the crashed starship is going to be a nerve-wracking endeavor...

ENCOUNTERS AND DANGERS EENCOUNTERSNCOUNTERS ANDAND D DANGERSANGERS

ENVIRONMENTAL DANGERS
Most life-bearing alien worlds have completely incompatible
biologies, so humans are utterly unaffected by their native
pathogens. The exceptions are typically planets where everything is
inimical to human life. Alien diseases that can affect humans are
comparatively rare, most of which are mutations or engineered
variants of diseases from Earth. Panacea drugs can aid the immune
system resist infection on unfamiliar worlds. Poisons are rarer,
but more dangerous – injecting an unfamiliar chemical into your
bloodstream or tissue is never a good idea.

Medical treatment can help a character's ability to resist and
recover from environmental dangers, aiding the character's
Endurance check.

Diseases
Diseases reduce a character's Characteristics, usually Endurance.
The character must make an Endurance check with the listed DM to
resist the effects of the disease. If the character fails the Endurance
check then he takes the listed damage and must make another
Endurance check a few hours or days later, depending on the interval
of the disease. Once an Endurance check has been passed, the
character has fought off the disease. Some more tenacious diseases
may require multiple successful checks to shake off.

Poisons
Poisons operate in the same way as diseases, but generally work
much faster and often have a wider range of effects. Most poisons
do not have an interval but apply their damage immediately.

Arsenic –2 2d6
Tr a n q G a s –1d6 Unconsciousness if

Extremes of Temperature
Unusually hot or cold worlds can cause damage unless the characters
are suitably protected. Temperatures are in Celsius.

Weather
High winds and torrential rain can inflict a negative Dice Modifier
of –1 to –4 to all skill checks made in the teeth of the weather,
depending on the intensity of conditions. Unusual weather effects
include flammable methane clouds, rain of sulphuric acid, mists of
poisonous gas, flash floods, carbon dioxide glaciers subliming to
gas in the heat of the characters' footsteps...

Falling
A character who falls on a 1-gravity world suffers 1d6 damage
per two meters fallen. High- or low-gravity worlds will increase or
decrease the damage. Look up the size code for the world and the
gravity level associated with it on page 170 and multiply the falling
damage by the gravity number. For a simpler method, round gravity
to the nearest 0.5 before multiplying.

A character who makes a successful Athletics check can reduce the
effective distance fallen for the purposes of calculating damage by a
number of meters equal to the Effect of his check.

FATIGUE
A character can become fatigued in several ways:

- After staying awake for a number of hours greater than his
    Endurance + 18.
- After performing heavy labour for a number of hours greater
    than his Endurance.
- After making a number of melee attacks greater than his
    Endurance in a single combat.
- Many other ways as mentioned in the text.

A fatigued character suffers a –2 DM to all checks until he rests.
The amount of rest needed varies but is usually 3 – the character's
Endurance DM hours (characters with an Endurance DM of +3 can
recover from fatigue in just 2d6 minutes). If a character suffers
fatigue while already fatigued they fall unconscious.

UNCONSCIOUSNESS
An unconscious character may make an Endurance check
after every minute of unconsciousness – if successful, he
regains consciousness. If he fails he must wait another minute
and can then try again with a +1 DM on the check for every
check previously failed.

INJURY AND RECOVERY
Injured characters are either wounded or seriously wounded. A
character is considered seriously wounded if he has lost at least
one point from all three of his physical characteristics. As soon as
one of his physical characteristics is restored, no matter how, he is
no longer seriously wounded.

ENCOUNTERS AND DANGERS EENCOUNTERSNCOUNTERS ANDAND D DANGERSANGERS

Seriously wounded characters who have somehow avoided
unconsciousness cannot move except to hobble or crawl along
at 1.5 meters per combat round. They also lose their minor
action in combat.

Wounded characters heal naturally and can also benefit from
medical care. When characteristic points return from healing,
players may choose which characteristic regains the points and may
split healing between characteristics if they wish.

Natural Healing
An injured character regains a number of characteristic points equal
to his 1d6 + Endurance DM per day of full rest. If the character
insists on continuing an active lifestyle he only heals a number of
characteristic points equal to 1 + Endurance DM per day. Characters
with a low Endurance DM (quite possibly from injury) may degrade
(lose more characteristic points) over time if they are unlucky or
cannot (or will not) rest.

A seriously wounded character only regains characteristic points
equal to his Endurance DM per day of rest, which means that the
character may never heal naturally and will even get worse if his
Endurance DM is currently negative.

Medical Treatment
First Aid: First Aid: Applying first aid restores a number of characteristic points
equal to twice the Effect of the Medic check. Points restored by first
aid are divided as desired among all damaged physical characteristics.
First aid must be applied within five minutes of the injuries being
received to be fully effective. A character can still benefit from first
aid up to an hour after their injury but they only receive a number of
characteristic points equal to the Effect of the Medic check. Performing
first aid on yourself is a Difficult (–2) task.

Surgery: Surgery: A character who is seriously wounded (after fi rst aid has
been applied) requires surgery. Surgery restores characteristic
points just like fi rst aid but if the check is failed the patient loses
characteristic points equal to the Effect. Surgery requires a hospital
or sickbay. Once one characteristic is back to its maximum level
the patient can benefi t from medical care. Surgery does not benefit
characters who are not seriously wounded. Performing surgery on
yourself is a Very Diffi cult (–4) task.

Medical Care: Medical Care: Medical care restores 2 + the character's Endurance
DM + the doctor's Medic skill in characteristic points per day, divided
evenly among all damaged characteristics. Medical care requires a
hospital or sickbay and for the patient to undergo full bed rest.

Standard procedure in most cases is to use medicinal slow (see
page 94) to hasten healing.

For example, Morn is mauled by an alien predator while exploring
a strange moon. He is able to drive the predator off with his
pistol, wounding it. Morn has suffered damage to all three of

his characteristics – he has lost 10 Endurance, 5 Dexterity and 3
Strength. Kathya applies first aid, bringing Morn's Strength back up
to its maximum level. With only two characteristics now wounded,
Morn qualifi es for medical care and is quickly restored to health.

Augmentation and Medical Care: Augmentation and Medical Care: Cybernetic or genetic augments
can interfere with medical treatment. All medical care or surgery
Medic rolls treating a character suffer a negative DM equal to the
difference in Technology Level between the medical facility and
the highest relevant implant. For example, a character with TL 15
Endurance implants being treated in a TL 10 hospital would give a
–5 DM to the surgeon's Medic skill checks.

Healing and Mental Characteristics
Other than Psionic Strength, which has its own rules (see page 152)
characters may also suffer damage to their Intelligence or even their
Education (representing loss of memory). Unless otherwise specified,
each mental characteristic heals at the rate of one point per day.

NON-PLAYER CHARACTERS
During the course of the player characters' adventures, the Referee
will play a huge variety of non-player characters – starport staff
and guards, traders, Imperial bureaucrats and nobles, dangerous
criminals, archaeologists and scientists, naval officers, alien
diplomats, untrustworthy brokers, primitive tribesmen, deranged
artifi cial intelligences, alien hive-minds and whatever else the
characters encounter. Most of these characters will appear only for
a single scene, so there is no need to lavish detail on a trader or
guard. Just come up with a personality trait or two and a name and
jot them down. If a non-player character is to appear multiple times
in the game, then the Referee should determine game statistics
and a fuller personality. While the focus of the game is always on
the player characters, important non-player characters do not exist
solely to serve as allies or antagonists. Non-player characters have
their own agendas and desires, and will pursue their own goals.
Sometimes, their schemes might enmesh the player characters!

For example, Erik has a Contact named Tarel Paragi, an Imperial
diplomat. Erik can call on Paragi when dealing with imperial
bureaucracies. What Erik does not know is that Tarel is secretly a
Zhodani spy, and that every favor that Erik asks of his friend is
putting him deeper in debt to a foreign power.

Random Character Traits
If the Referee is stuck for a motivation or quirk for a non-player
character, roll 2d6 on this chart, treating one die as tens and the
other as units.

Generating Non-Player Characters
While non-player characters can be generated using the normal
character generation rules, it is generally faster just to note down
characteristics and a few appropriate skills. A skilled professional
has two or three levels in skills related to his occupation, and zero
or one levels in a half-dozen other skills.

ENCOUNTERS AND DANGERS ENCOUNTERS AND DANGERS

There are fi ve types of non-player characters who will show up
throughout a Tr a v e l l e r campaign: allies, contacts, enemies, rivals
and patrons.

AlliesAllies are NPCs who are willing to go out of their way to help the
characters. An ally is willing to risk his reputation, his status and
even his life for his friends, but will expect equal consideration from

the characters. Allies are actively looking to further the careers of the
characters, passing on useful information and rumors. In general,
characters can call on an ally's aid once per year without penalty, but
expecting any more aid will overstress the ally's resources. (The ally
will still give help if asked, but this may result in the ally losing his
position or influence).

ENCOUNTERS AND DANGERS EENCOUNTERSNCOUNTERS ANDAND D DANGERSANGERS

Erik's ally is his old Naval commander, Jan Halos, who mustered
out of the Navy around the same time as Erik. Halos is now a
wandering free trader with his own starship. In the past, Halos
has flown in to rescue Erik's ship from attack and aided Erik in a
dangerous smuggling mission. If Erik asked, Halos would risk
anything for him.

Contacts Contacts are willing to help the character when they can, but only in
a limited fashion. An ally would give the characters a weapon, but a
contact would only tell the characters where they can purchase it.

Erik's contact is Tarel Paragi, a diplomat. Tarel will pass on useful
information to Erik, in exchange for other rumors and bits of data.
Ta r e l w i l l a d v i s e E r i k w h e n d e a l i n g w i t h t h e I m p e r i a l b u r e a u c r a c y,
but will not endanger himself. Theirs is an alliance of convenience
as far as the diplomat is concerned.

Remember, there is no faster-than-light communication in the
Tr a v e l l e r setting. Allies and contacts can only be contacted
when in the same system, and there will be a delay in
communications traffic of several seconds or even minutes if the
characters are on different worlds.

Rivals Rivals and enemies enemies are both adversaries of the player characters

- enemies are just willing to go further. While scenarios can revolve
around the efforts of a rival to discredit or kill the characters, the
Referee should also drop rivals and enemies into other plots.
For example, if the characters are trying to find a starport willing
to repair their damaged ship, a rival might show up in the
system and poach passengers.

Enemies and especially rivals should be mobile. If the characters
are going to spend their time jumping from system to system, then
their rivals should have starships of their own so the characters

encounter them again and again. Enemies can be stationary,
but should have a long enough reach to affect the characters.
Totalitarian governments, evil conspiracies or interstellar
corporations make great enemies.

Erik's rival is Manfred Greel, a notorious corsair and thief. Greel
has a grudge against Erik, and takes great pleasure in tormenting or
sabotaging anything Erik does. Greel has come to enjoy their little
contests, though, and greatly prefers to humiliate and provoke Erik
instead of trying to kill him.

Patrons and Missions
Patrons are non-player characters in positions of power, authority,
influence or dire need who employ the characters and give them
missions. Sometimes, the reward from a mission will be purely
financial – the characters might be hired as bodyguards, mercenaries,
couriers, thieves or scouts for a few hundred credits. Other missions
will have less tangible rewards, such as being owed a favor by the
patron, acquisition of status or influence, or just the knowledge of
having done the right thing.

SAMPLE PATRONS
Patrons are employers, contacts, adventure hooks or headaches
for the player characters. The patron needs something done,
and is prepared to pay the player characters very well for them
to do it – but things have a habit of going wrong. Each patron
encounter lists:

- The patron's name and role.
- The skills and resources required to complete the mission
- The suggested reward for the mission
- The mission as described to the characters
- What's really going on. Several possible variants will be
    presented – either pick or roll for which is the real situation.

When integrating patrons into your campaign, if you have established
a character with that role already, then you can tie patron encounters
with that role to that character. For example, if the player characters
have a contact in the Imperial Navy, then you can reuse that patron

Payment for Missions
The scale of payment for missions varies depending on how
diffi cult the mission is, but also on the characters' circumstances.
A band of penniless travellers who make their way from star
system to system in low berths might be happy to be paid 5,000
Credits each for two weeks' work but the crew of a free trader can
make hundreds of thousands of credits by spending that time
shipping cargo. In fact, characters with huge ship mortgages to
maintain will have to turn down unprofi table missions.

A wise patron, therefore, should always offer the characters more
than they can get by trading. As a rule of thumb, this comes to
about 1,000 to 2,000 Credits per ton of cargo space available to
them on a ship, per two weeks of work.

player characters than a constant parade of disposable patrons.

Jefri haut-Oschem, Planetologist
Required: Required: Life Sciences, Survival; Spacecraft
Reward: Reward: Cr. 2,000/day plus expenses.

Players' InformationPlayers' Information
His Excellency haut-Oschem is a respected Imperial Planetologist,
specialising in worlds that are nearly habitable. A planet might
be a little too cold, or too dry, or be infested with a lethal native
species. Haut-Oschem's genius is in making tiny changes to a
planet's ecosystem or climate. All too often, a change can ripple out
through the complex balances of a planetary environment and have
unforeseen consequences.

Haut-Oschem requires a spacecraft and a crew trained in the
sciences for a brief period of research – no more than a few weeks,
possibly a month or two. While haut-Oschem has worked with the
Imperial Scout Service in the past, this mission is entirely under
the aegis of private research. The ship will be visiting worlds
outside settled space.

Referee's InformationReferee's Information
Any character with contacts in the Scout service can find out that
haut-Oschem has quarrelled with the Survey section, and that his
once-stellar career has dark clouds hanging over it. Something
has gone wrong...

1. Haut-Oschem has been replaced in the eyes of the Scout service
    by a younger researcher, Harad Leish. Old haut-Oschem wants
    to prove that his theories and methodologies are still valid.
    Leish and a laboratory ship from the Scout Service are currently
    surveying a jungle world inhabited by numerous hostile species.
    To p r o v e h i s w o r t h , h a u t - O s c h e m n e e d s t o fi n d a w a y f o r h u m a n s
    to live safely on the world before the Scout service do.
2. As above, but haut-Oschem is bitter, and his real plan is to
    sabotage Leish's survey team.
3. Haut-Oschem has discovered that he made a terrible mistake
    at the start of his career. He approved the settlement of a world
    before he fully understood the ecosystem. Every few centuries,
    a species of carnivorous locusts hatches in vast swarms and
    devours everything in their path. The characters need to find a
    way to stop the insects from hatching.
4. As above, but haut-Oschem wants to preserve his reputation
    above all else. The characters need to stop the insects without
    revealing what they're doing to the settlers.
5. Haut-Oschem discovered something very valuable on his most
    recent survey, such as a massive deposit of precious metals or
    alien technology. He wants the characters to help him recover it.
6. As above, but haut-Oschem is in a race with the Scout service.
    He's not the only one to have read between the lines in
    his latest survey.

Astor Kemble, Spy
Required: Required: Deception, Mechanic/Engineer/Pilot/Comms
Reward: Reward: Cr. 5,000 and a new contact

Players' InformationPlayers' Information
Astor Kemble is a 'freelance researcher' – a spy for hire. Her current
mission is to investigate links between a shipping corporation,
Jump Transit, and Ine Givar terrorist cells. Jump Transit may be
shipping weapons past Imperial patrols. She suspects that the Ine
Givar leaders in the area know she is on their trail, so she needs to
use unfamiliar faces to fi nish her mission.

The mission is to infi ltrate the shipping company, confi rm that the
weapons are being smuggled by Jump Transit, and if so, follow the
weapons to their destination.

Referee's InformationReferee's Information
Kemble approaches the characters after observing them for some
time, to learn the best way to win their confidence and trust. If
they are patriots, then she poses as an Imperial agent; if they get
into trouble, she shows up to rescue them or help them; if they are
mercenaries, she shows up with a big wad of credits. The mission is
a lot more dangerous than Kemble initially suggests.

She has already infi ltrated Jump Transit's offi ce on a hub world,
and can arrange for the characters to get jobs with the company.
Following the shipments is up to them.

1. Kemble is on the wrong trail – Jump Transit is almost entirely
    innocent. The weapons shipments are being transported by a
    band of illegal smugglers, who are using old Jump Transit cargo
    containers stolen from starports. The characters need to be on
    watch at the end of their journey.
2. Jump Transit is indeed smuggling weapons, but en route, the
    cargo ship is attacked by pirates. The characters will need
    to either defeat the pirates or retrieve the stolen goods to
    complete their mission.
3. Kemble is discovered and killed by the Ine Givar after the
    characters begin their time undercover. Fortunately, the cargo
    ship jumps away before the other terrorists are informed that
    the PCs are spies. They need to complete their mission before
    the word reaches the cargo ship's destination.
4. The Ine Givar are aware the Imperium are on their trail. The
    'weapon' they are smuggling is actually a bomb, designed
    to go off when the cargo ship is in jump space, killing
    any Imperial investigators.
5. The weapons aren't destined for the Ine Givar – they are for a
    group of rebels on an oppressed planet. The characters may
    find themselves sympathetic to their cause.
6. Kemble is actually working for the Ine Givar – the characters are
    actually protecting her cargo of weapons through pirate attacks
    and Imperial customs inspections.

The Margrave of Vilmaer, Eccentric Noble
Required: Required: Carouse, Steward, Perform, Deception or Survival
Reward: Reward: Cr. 10,000

Players' InformationPlayers' Information
Vilmaer is an obscure rock in a distant solar system in the heart
of the Imperium. The lords of Vilmaer invested wisely centuries
ago and became obscenely wealthy. The family has become very
eccentric over the years. The current Margrave of Vilmaer departed
on a 'short tour' some forty years ago and has wandered the galaxy
since on cruise liners and casino ships. His entourage waxes
and wanes, but the Margrave is always at the center of a cloud of
hangers-on and sycophants.

The Margrave is a man of strange tastes, who sometimes employs
adventurers for various whimsical or impossible tasks, often for the
entertainment of his friends. Those who can amuse the Margrave of
Vilmaer are showered with wealth.

Referee's InformationReferee's Information
While the general public sees the Margrave as either an amusingly
eccentric buffoon or a shameful noble who squanders millions of
credits on fripperies, there is another side to Vilmaer. The Margrave
is rumored to be involved with Imperial Naval Intelligence, or
a roving spy for the Moot, or for one of a dozen factions. Where
Vilmaer goes, intrigue follows.

1. Vilmaer wants the characters to entertain his entourage of
    nobles. They must come up with a plan to entertain a dozen
    jaded, self-obsessed boors.
2. As above, but Vilmaer suspects an assassin is about to strike,
    and wants the characters by his side to protect him.
3. Vilmaer wants the characters to help him lose a group of
    particularly annoying reporters. The characters need to spirit
    the Margrave away and get him at least six parsecs distant from
    his cruise ship before they discover he's gone.
4. Vilmaer wants the characters to organise a hunting expedition
    for him and his guests.
5. As above, but the hunting expedition is actually cover for a
    diplomatic mission. The characters must cover for the Margrave
    in his absence.
6. As 4, but the Margrave has gone insane, and will sabotage the
    hunting mission to endanger his followers.

First Lander Thu, Miner
Required: Required: Pilot, Gunnery, Sensors, Melee or Gun Combat,
possibly a ship
Reward: Reward: Cr. 20,000/Cr. 2,000,000

Players' InformationPlayers' Information
The miners of Dar Al'khubat went to space many generations ago.
They hollowed out asteroids to build their cities and refineries;
they lived as close to their ships as a nomad to his horse. They
engineered their children to tolerate microgravity and high
background radiation, and turned their back on the wider cosmos.

Their only regular contacts with the outside world were the oreships
that hauled metals from the belt to the mainworld every few weeks.
When the resources of one belt are exhausted or the markets shift,
the miners jump to another system and begin again.

Now, one of the Dar Al'khubat miners has come to the starport,
seeking aid. First Lander Thu is a small man, bowed by the unfamiliar
weight of gravity. The miners have come under attack, and he
needs help resolving the situation. Thu explains that the nomadic
miners have a contract with the rulers of the local system to deliver
a certain quantity of ore every month, and that these attacks are
threatening their ability to reach this quota. Calling for outside aid is
an unpopular move among his people, but the First Lander believes
it is better than breaking contract and having to flee the system.

If the characters have their own ship, then they are paid more to
cover damage and expenses. If they do not, then Thu offers them
the use of a Seeker (see page 114) while they investigate.

Referee's InformationReferee's Information
The attacks are being aided by a faction within the miners who believe
that Thu has tied them to an unfair contract. They intend to force a
breach of contract so they can destroy Thu's political standing. This
faction is led by Thu's estranged daughter, Saj dam-Thu.

1. The attacks have been on the ships that carry the ore. The
    attackers should not have been able to damage the massive
    ore-ships, and in fact the damage came from bombs hidden
    in the ore.
2. The attacks happen when the miner ships are refuelling at the
    system's gas giant. The attacking vessels are lurking in the
    upper atmosphere.
3. Thu is more interested in payments from the mainworld's
    corporations than in his people. The attacks have been protests,
    nothing more. The characters are on the wrong side.
4. The attacks are nothing to do with the miners' contract
    - there's something hidden in the asteroid belt that someone
    wants to protect.
5. The attacks have been at ships working at asteroids. The
    characters will need to set a trap for the attackers.
6. The rebel faction within the miners is in league with a foreign
    power that is manipulating events to use the Dar al'Khubat
    miners as a spy network.

Referee's InformationReferee's Information
Galm is skirting the edge of legality by dealing in alien artefacts
and hazardous creatures. The only reason his goods are not illegal
is because the law has not caught up with them. He has contacts
in the Scout service and among alien governments providing him
with a constant stream of unusual items, which he routes to various
collectors and buyers.

1. The fi rst item is a crate of alien machinery. When taken into
    jumpspace, it activates and displays a holographic starmap.
    The device is an alien navigational device. Galm's supplier
    brought it to him in the hold of a massive freighter, and no-one
    saw the holographic map. Do the characters follow the map?
    What will Galm's buyer do with it?
2. As above, but it's actually a warning beacon. The map leads to
    the location of an ancient automated defence system.
3. The second item is a savage alien predator in a cage, which
    is being shipped to a zoo. The predator is actually about to
    spawn, and the larvae are small enough to escape the confines
    of the cage.
4. As above, but the predator is sentient. During the later stages
    of pregnancy, the species becomes incapable of higher thought
    and communication as it conserves energy for spawning.
5. The third item has been stolen from an Aslan museum, and is a
    piece of artwork of great signifi cance to them. An Aslan hunting
    party is on the item's trail, and know the characters have it.
    However, the buyer is also an Aslan, who will be... displeased if
    they fail to deliver it.
6. As above, but the item is the deed to a vast tract of territory that
    can be politically destabilizing to a whole clan.

Helma Tharrius, Starport Administrator
Required: Required: Investigate, Deception, Gun Combat
Reward: Reward: Cr. 20,000

Players' InformationPlayers' Information
Under Tharrius' fi rm hand, the small Class C starport has thrived
for years in the midst of political turmoil. This world is heavily
balkanised and all the different factions want control of the starport.
The port is Imperial territory and Tharrius is avowedly neutral, but
she has to play the different factions off against each other and
avoid any appearance of bias.

Now, she needs help. The head of station security, Ruthven, has
been murdered. The evidence points to Tharrius having carried out
the murder – her snub pistol was stolen from her quarters and used
to kill Ruthven. She claims to have been framed. She cannot trust
any of her staff, as almost everyone in the starport favors one or
other of the planetary factions. The PCs' ship arrived just after the
murder, so they are the only people in the port that she knows were
not responsible.

Referee's InformationReferee's Information
This is effectively a locked-room mystery. The characters need to solve
the murder quickly, before the starport reopens and the killer flees.

1. The killer was a professional assassin who arrived recently.
    He was hired offworld to remove Tharrius from her position
    as starport administrator. He will attempt to steal a spacecraft
    and flee the planet.
2. The killer was one of the cleaning staff, who has having an affair
    with Ruthven. It was a crime of passion, using a weapon stolen
    from Tharrius' quarters.
3. Ruthven killed himself using a weapon he stole from Tharrius'
    quarters. He was suffering from an incurable disease, and
    decided to use his inevitable death to advance the cause of one
    of the planetary factions.
4. The killer is a deranged serial killer, who is going to eliminate
    one member of each of the planetary factions, each time using
    a weapon stolen from the previous victim. He will close the
    circle with Tharrius, the only apolitical personage at the port.
    He's also a member of the security team.
5. The killer is a member of a pirate gang, who want to use the
    port as a base of operations. Both Tharrius and Ruthven were
    obstacles to their plans.
6. Tharrius is the killer. She was manipulated by a psion to murder
    Ruthven.

Abber Koja, Desperate Peasant
Required: Required: Tactics, Leadership, Gun Combat

Players' InformationPlayers' Information
Koja is the headman of a village on a backwater planet, far from the
arteries of galactic commerce. Life is quiet, peaceful and slow there

- until a few years ago. The previous planetary ruler died and his heir
is cruel and greedy. He is oppressing the peasants and they have no
choice but to rebel. They have no idea how to fi ght a modern war
- they want to hire mercenaries to train them and help them.

Referee's InformationReferee's Information
Koja is being mostly honest. He does indeed need mercenaries to
train and lead a peasant uprising, but things are not quite as simple
as they seem.

1. Koja's planet is a hellhole of jungle and swamps. Just surviving
    there is a hazardous ordeal. Fighting a war there will be a
    nightmare.
2. There is a primitive indigenous species on the planet who Koja's
    peasants have been using as servants – or slaves, depending
    on who you ask. The new ruler issued an edict freeing all the
    indentured servants.
3. As above, but the ruler never freed the servants. He promised
    he would but he has reneged. Koja is a member of the enslaved
    species and is trying to hold the ruler to his word.
4. The new ruler is a puppet of the corporations and the peasant
    army will be going up against corporate troops equipped with
    the best equipment. Fortunately, the corporations only control
    the capital city and the starport at the moment.
5. The planet was an agricultural backwater until the discovery
    of signifi cant mineral resources. The peasants are paying the
    characters out of this sudden wealth.
6. As above, but the peasants do not control these resources. The
    characters will have to fi ght to get paid.

RivalsRivals
Enemies of the player characters can cause trouble in a variety of ways. In most of these cases, the interference is technically legal, so these problems
cannot be solved with fi repower. Throw these complications in when a rival shows up and you want to make the player characters' lives more
interesting!

The rival...

1. ... floods the market with goods, rendering the cargo brought by the player characters worthless.
2. ... attempts to undercut the player characters, taking whatever job or mercenary ticket they are on away from them.
3. ... spreads rumors about the characters, turning allies against them.
4. ... informs the characters' enemies about their resources and skills.
5. ... sabotages the characters' ship or equipment.
6. ... spies on the characters and waits for them to do something illegal or embarrassing that he can capitalise on.

EQUIPMENT

The vast number of tools and devices in the universe and the
variation in their potential costs and values defy classification; it is
impossible to note and defi ne them all. The objects in this chapter are
presented as common examples. Different worlds in the Imperium
use different manufacturing techniques, different design styles, and
even different physical principles to achieve the same effect. A pistol
on one world might resemble a conventional firearm; on another,
the same type of gun would be elaborately decorated and coloured
to reflect its importance in that world's martial culture; elsewhere,
it might be heavily integrated with computers to aid targeting, or
use bullets formed from ice mixed with plastic polymers, or be
constructed from sensor-baffling materials and treated woods to
avoid detection by security sensors.

Each item is listed with the Technology Level needed to manufacture
it, its mass (in kg) and its cost. If an item's mass or cost is not
listed, then its mass or cost is negligible. Items are available for
several Technology Levels after they become possible, but it is often
quite hard to fi nd a low-tech item on a high-tech world (few TL 13
spacefaring civilizations are going to produce a lot of crossbows or
backpack radios). The prices do assume, though, that the planet
is in regular trade contact with the rest of the Imperium. Isolated
worlds may charge vastly higher prices for some items, especially
cutting-edge technology. A simple computer system might sell for a
few hundred credits on most worlds, but on a backward TL 6 world
where that computer has just been developed, then purchasing it
might require the equivalent of millions of credits.

Credits
The Imperial Credit (Cr.) is the standard unit of currency in the
Imperium. Larger denominations include the KiloCredit (KCr; 1,000
Credits) and the MegaCredit (MCr; 1,000,000 Credits). The physical
credit is minted by the Imperium and is virtually impossible to falsify.

Citizens of high-technology (TL 8+) planets often use electronic
Credits. Transactions are authenticated and managed using
computers or personal comms. While electronic credits work
perfectly well in-system, the lack of FTL communications across
the Imperium means that it is possible for a traveller to outrun his
credits – having a million credits in one's bank account on Sylea is
all well and good, but if you are twenty parsecs away and the data
has not caught up with you, then that money is inaccessible to you.
Large banks, corporations and other financial institutions use the X-
boat network to synchronise important fi nancial records, but private
citizens must make arrangements to keep credits available.

It is possible to notify one's bank and have a line of credit sent ahead
(or at least sent at the same time) if you know your destination but
wandering travellers must often use physical cash or trade goods. In
addition to physical credits, precious metals, gemstones, radioactive
elements or technological wonders are sometimes used as barter
on many worlds.

Living
A standard meal costs 5 credits to 50 credits or more per person,
depending on the level of quality and service. A burger of unidentifi able
meat-like substances eaten standing up in a fast-food joint costs
2–3 credits; a fi ne meal at the Traveller's Aid Hostel costs 20 credits,
while a sybaritic feast of a dozen courses and entertainments costs
500 credits or more.

Accommodation for a night in a cheap hotel costs 10 credits; a
good hotel can be found for 50–100 credits. Luxury hotels cost 100
credits or more. The Traveller's Aid Hostel is available to members
and their guests for 20 credits/night.

A character living on board ship is assumed to have his food and
lodging taken care of. A character living on a planet or orbital for a
long period must spend money on their living costs – the amount
depends on the quality of life desired. A character who does not live
at the standard listed for his Social Standing risks being embarrassed
and even losing his standing.

ARMOR
Unless otherwise noted, only one type of armor can be worn at
a time. Resolve damage from the outside in – damage that gets
through the outer layer of armor is next applied to the inner layer.

Some armors have a required skill. A character suffers a –2 DM to
all actions taken in the armor per missing skill level, including level

0. For example, a character with no Vacc Suit skill who is in a suit
that needs Vacc Suit 1 would have a –4 DM to all his rolls.

Jack (TL 1): Jack (TL 1): A natural or synthetic leather jacket or body suit covering
the torso and upper arms and legs. Jack is better than ordinary
clothing or bare skin when defending against blades but bullets will
punch through it easily.

Mesh (TL 6):Mesh (TL 6): A jacket or body suit lined with a flexible metal or
plastic mesh that gives it added protection against bullets.

Cloth (TL 7):Cloth (TL 7): A heavy duty body suit tailored from ballistic cloth. The
fabric absorbs impact energy and spreads it over the body, which can
result in bruising. However, cloth armor is highly useful and versatile

- it can be effectively concealed under normal clothing although
observers making an Investigate or Recon check at 8+ will notice
something unusual. TL 10 cloth armor is lighter and more flexible,
and is indistinguishable from ordinary clothing to the naked eye.

Flak Jacket (TL 7):Flak Jacket (TL 7): A less expensive version of ballistic cloth, the
bulky flak jacket is an unmistakably military garment. The TL 8 flak
jacket incorporates advanced polymers which allow for greater
protection without noticeably increasing bulk.

Vacc Suit (TL 8):Vacc Suit (TL 8): The vacc suit or space suit is the spacer's best
friend, providing life support and protection when in space. Early
vacc suits are unwieldy and uncomfortable, but they quickly shrink as
technology advances. A vacc suit provides a breathable atmosphere
and protection from the extremes of temperature, low pressure and
radiation typically found in a hard vacuum, for six hours. At TL 14,
'tailored' vacc suits feel like ordinary clothing with a flexible hood
and face mask.

Hostile Environment Vacc Suit (TL 8):Hostile Environment Vacc Suit (TL 8): Hostile environment suits
are designed for conditions where a normal vacc suit would be

*As powered armor, battle dress largely supports its own weight. The mass in brackets is the effective mass to the wearer
while the suit is powered up and turned on. The actual mass of the suit is the normal value.

EQUIPMENT EQUIPMENT

insuffi cient, such as deep underwater, worlds shrouded
in toxic or corrosive gases, extremes of radiation or
temperature, or other locales that offer serious physical
danger as well as the lack of a breathable atmosphere.
HEV suits provide all the life support offered by a normal
vacc suit (for six hours) but are also impervious to
flames, intense radiation such as that found at
nuclear blast sites, and high pressure environments
like undersea trenches. The amount of protection
increases with the Technology Level – as a rule of
thumb, apply the HEV suit's armor rating against
any damage done by a hostile environment.

AblatAblat (TL 9): A cheap alternative to Reflec, ablat
armor is made from a material that ablates
(vaporises) when hit by laser fire. Each laser hit on
ablat reduces its armor value (versus lasers) by
one, but the armor is cheap and easily replaceable.

Refl ec (TL 10):Reflec (TL 10): Reflec armor is a flexible plastic suit with layers
of reflective material and heat-dispersing gel. It is highly effective
against lasers, but provides no protection against other attacks.
Reflec can be worn with other armor but is hard to obtain and
quite expensive.

Combat Armor (TL 11):Combat Armor (TL 11): This full-body suit is used by the military
and not generally available on the open market, although those with
military or criminal contacts can obtain it without much difficulty.
It is issued to troop units and mercenary battalions. Combat
armor protects from hard vacuum in the same way as a vacc suit
and provides life support for six hours. TL 12 combat armor is
considerably lighter, substituting carbon-tube weave for the smart
plastic of the previous generation. TL 14 combat armor offers
vastly improved protection without impairing movement.

Battle Dress (TL 13):Battle Dress (TL 13): The ultimate personal armor, battle dress is
a powered form of combat armor. The servomotors vastly increase
the user's speed and strength, boosting his Strength and Dexterity by
+4 while wearing the armor. Damage to the wearer's characteristics
is calculated as normal, but the values from the armor are used for
all other purposes such as hand to hand damage or skill checks. The

HEV suit. TL 14 battle dress is considerably stronger, giving Strength
+6 instead of +4, and upgrades its internal systems to Computer/3
(although still running Tactics 2).

Options
Most of the options listed here can also be applied to normal
clothing at the same cost. The exceptions are extended life support
and grav assist.

Eye Protection (TL 6):Eye Protection (TL 6): Many armors include eye protection such as
visors or goggles to guard against flying debris but such protection
becomes absolutely vital at TL 9 to guard against the blinding effects
of lasers. Eye protection can be added to any armor and is included
for free in any TL 9+ armor. Cr 50.

Magnetic Grapples (TL 8):Magnetic Grapples (TL 8): Magnetic plates in the boots of the
armor allow the user to walk normally on a spacecraft without
artifi cial gravity. Cr. 100.

Computer Weave (TL 10):Computer Weave (TL 10): Computer weave can be added to any
armor that does not already have a computer system, and gives

Breach!
Vacc and HEV suits are armored and self-repairing on a small
scale. Typical punctures from bullets, lasers, and even melee
weapons will cause small tears that seal themselves so quickly
as to have no game effect. Serious breaches, whether caused by
high-powered energy weapons, sabotage, or the jaws of a giant
space monster, expose the wearer of the suit to the environment

- assuming they survive whatever caused the breach in the first
place. The Referee will explain what that entails depending on
the environment the characters are in, but in many cases it will
lead to instant and unavoidable death. You have been warned.

suit has a built-in computer/2 running an Expert Tactics (military)/2
program (see page 92) to give tactical advice and updates and
is commonly outfi tted with numerous upgrades. The suit is fully
enclosed, with a six-hour air supply and gives full protection against
environmental hazards – including NBC shielding – as if it was an

Extended Life Support (TL 10):Extended Life Support (TL 10): This upgrade can be added to
any suit that provides life support (vacc suit, HEV suit, combat
armor, battle dress). By adding high-pressure oxygen tanks
and recycling systems, the suit now provides eighteen hours of
oxygen. Cr. 10,000.

Medikit (TL 10):Medikit (TL 10): An internal medical scanner and drug injector,
the medikit can be installed in combat armor, battle dress or a
vacc suit. It automatically applies first aid if the wearer is reduced
to Endurance 0 (treat the Medikit as having Medic 3). It can also
administer Fast Drug on command, or if life support systems are
failing (turning remaining minutes of life support into hours). Cr
5,000. A TL 11 medikit can also inject Combat or Slow drugs and the
Slow Drug antidote on command. Cr 10,000.

Smart Fabric (TL 10):Smart Fabric (TL 10): Smart fabric resists stains and dirt, cleaning
itself automatically. Smart fabric armor sloughs off dirt, dust and
mud automatically (but this function can be suspended for the
purposes of camouflage). Cr. 1,000.

IR Chameleon (TL 12):IR Chameleon (TL 12): IR (infra-red) chameleon technology can
be added to any full-body suit of clothing or armor. It selectively
bleeds heat to match background IR levels and effectively renders
the wearer invisible to IR (Very Diffi cult (–4) to detect with sensors).
IR Chameleon costs Cr. 5,000.

Grav Assist (TL 12):Grav Assist (TL 12): This upgrade can be added to combat armor
or battle dress only, and adds the functionality of a grav belt to the
armor at the cost of Cr. 110,000. The TL 15 version lasts longer.
Costs Cr 120,000. See grav belt, page 103.

Vislight Chameleon (TL 13):Vislight Chameleon (TL 13): A more advanced form of IR Chameleon,
Vislight Chameleon covers the surface of the armor with light-
bending technology, making the wearer nearly invisible to the naked
eye (+4 DM to Stealth rolls). Vislight Chameleon costs Cr. 50,000.

AUGMENTS
While technology is capable of significantly altering and improving
the human form, obvious cybernetic, genetic or surgical alteration
of the human form is frowned upon in the Imperium. While
humans can be altered to survive on hostile worlds – denizens of
a waterworld might be given gills and finger-webbing, while those
living on a world with dangerous native micro-organisms might
have their immune and digestive systems altered to compensate –
unnecessary augmentation is seen as unpleasant and even perverse
in many cultures. Despite this, there are some worlds where genetic
alteration or cybernetics are widespread or even mandatory, just as
there are worlds where they are strictly forbidden.

Most of the items in this category can be cybernetic (mechanical or
electronic implants and prostheses), biological (genetic engineering
and surgical alternation) or both (a more common solution), but
the general term 'augment' is used for all of them.

Augmentation can bring characteristics above the normal maximum
for a race.

Augments can interfere with medical treatment. All long-term care or
surgery Medic rolls (see page 75) treating an augmented character
suffer a negative DM equal to the difference in Technology Level
between the medical facility and the highest relevant implant. For
example, a character with TL 15 Endurance implants being treated
in a TL 10 hospital would give a –5 DM to the surgeon's Medic skill
checks.

Neural Comm (TL 10): Neural Comm (TL 10): A neural comm has identical capacities to a
standard comm (see page 90), but the cost is much higher and the
TL is increased by 2. For example, an audio-only comm costs 250
Credits and is TL 10. A character can access the capabilities of a
neural comm by thought alone but must still make any relevant skill
checks and must still speak aloud to send audio messages.

TL 10 Audio only Cr. 1,000
TL 12 Audio and visual, Computer/0 Cr. 5,000
TL 14 Multiple forms of data, Computer/1 Cr. 20,000

Subdermal Armor (TL 10): Subdermal Armor (TL 10): Adds a mesh of ballistic fibres to the
skin and reinforces the bones, giving the character extra armor.
Subdermal armor stacks with other protection. Subdermal armor
can be as obvious or subtle as the recipient desires.

TL 10 Armor 1 Cr. 50,000
TL 11 Armor 3 Cr. 100,000

Physical Characteristic Augmentation (TL 11): Physical Characteristic Augmentation (TL 11): A character's
Endurance, Strength or Dexterity can be increased in various
ways, from replacing motor neurons with faster synthetic cells, to
reinforcing bones and replacing organs with tougher vat-grown
clones. Augmentations must be purchased for each characteristic
separately.

TL 15 Characteristic +3 Cr. 5,000,000

Intelligence Augmentation (TL 12): Intelligence Augmentation (TL 12): Replacing slow nerve cells with
faster synthetic substrates and implanting optoelectronic boosters
can increase the speed at which a character thinks, effectively
boosting his Intelligence.

TL 14 Intelligence +2 Cr. 1,000,000
TL 16 Intelligence +3 Cr. 5,000,000

Skill Augmentation (TL 12): Skill Augmentation (TL 12): The character's nervous system is
rewired to be more suited to a particular task. A pilot might have
his reflexes and sense of balance improved; a broker might be
made capable of controlling his pupil responses and smelling the

EEQUIPMENTQUIPMENT EQUIPMENT

pheromones and skin salinity of the other party. A skill augmentation
gives the character a +1 DM when using that skill. Cr. 50,000. A
character can only have one skill augmentation and must possess
that skill at level 0 to benefi t from the augmentation.

Wafer Jack (TL 12): Wafer Jack (TL 12): A wafer jack is a computer system implanted
into the base of the skull that consists of an external data socket
and a processor running an interface program. A character with a
wafer jack can use expert programs for tasks relying on Intelligence
or Education only. The main benefi t of the jack is that it is much
smaller and more discrete than a hand computer, and the user
can access the expert program by thought alone. A wafer jack is
a Computer/2 (Computer/4 at TL 13) and can only run expert
programs. It is always running Intelligent Interface at no cost. Cr.
10,000. (Cr. 15,000 at TL 13.)

Enhanced Vision (TL 13): Enhanced Vision (TL 13): A character can be implanted with
cybernetic eyes giving him the abilities of a set of binoculars and IR/
Light Intensifi er goggles at the cost of Cr. 25,000.

COMMUNICATIONS
Communications technology rapidly merges with computer
technology at higher technology levels. Above Technology Level 10
in most cultures, it is unthinkable to be out of touch except in the
most remote areas.

Bug (TL 5):Bug (TL 5): Surveillance devices such as hidden microphones and
tiny cameras, bugs are available from TL 5 onwards. They rapidly
miniaturise and become more intelligent. A TL 14 bug can be no
bigger than a dust mote. The smaller a bug, though, the shorter its
range – a bug that transmits data needs a much larger power supply
than one that just records until it is collected.

Audio: The bug records anything it hears.
Visual: The bug records anything it sees.
Data: If attached to a computer system, the bug can search and
copy data from the computer. The bug cannot breach computer
security on its own, but if a user accesses the computer in the bug's
presence, the bug can read his data.
Bioscan: The bug has a basic biological scanner, allowing it to
sample the area for DNA traces, chemical taint and so forth.
Computer/1: The bug has an onboard computer system with
Computer/1.

A bug can be active or passive. An active bug transmits data (either
constantly, or when triggered). Passive bugs just record until activated.

Comm (TL 6):Comm (TL 6): A personal comm unit is a portable telecommunications
device/computer/camera, ranging in size from a bulky handset
to a slim watch or pen-like cylinder. Larger comms have physical
controls and screens, while smaller units either project data
and control displays onto nearby surfaces, have fold-out plastic
screens, or connect to cybernetics. Comms have only short-range
transmission and reception capabilities, but most technologically
advanced worlds will have planet-wide comm networks allowing the
user to send messages and access data anywhere.

communications device and relaying messages back and forth.
Commdots have a range of only a few meters. They are usually used
as hands-free communicators, but can also be used as improvised
bugs or throat microphones. Cr. 10 each.

Holographic Projector (TL 11):Holographic Projector (TL 11): A holographic projector is a toaster-
sized box that, when activated, creates a three-dimensional image
in the space around it or nearby – the range is approximately three
meters in all directions. The image can be given pre-programmed
animations within a limited range and the projector includes
speakers for making sound. The projected holograms are obviously
not real so this device is mostly used for communication. The TL
12 version can produce holograms real enough to fool anyone
who fails an Intelligence check (made upon fi rst seeing the
hologram) and the TL 13 version can produce holograms that are
true-to-life images.

COMPUTERS
The power of a computer is given by its rating (Computer/1,
Computer/2 and so forth), which measures the complexity of the
programs it can run. (Storage space is effectively unlimited at TL
9 and above.) Programs are rated by the computer rating they
require. A system can run a number of programs up to its rating

- for example, a Computer/2 could run two programs requiring
Program/1 at a time, or one Program/2, or a Program/2 and any
number of Program/0s. The one exception is that a Computer/0 can
only run one Program/0 at a time.

The computers listed here are laptop size. Battery life is two hours at
TL 7, eight hours at TL 8, and effectively unlimited at TL 9 and above.
Desktop computers offer a slightly greater amount of processing
power for the same cost but not enough to make a difference in-
game. Desktops become obsolete during TL 8 although some retro-
technology enthusiasts may create old-fashioned cases for their
smaller, lighter computers.

holographic display terminal can be much smaller than one with a
physical keyboard and screen. A computer terminal has Computer/0,
and costs Cr. 200.

Hand Computer (TL 7):Hand Computer (TL 7): A hand computer is a portable computer
system with considerable processing power. It is more powerful than
a computer terminal, and can be used without access to a network.
A hand computer costs twice as much as a normal computer of the
same TL but can he held in one hand and operated with the other.

Options
Data Display/Recorder (TL 13):Data Display/Recorder (TL 13): This headpiece worn over one or
both eyes provides a continuous heads-up display for the user,
allowing him to view computer data from any linked system. Because
of the transparent screen vision is not obscured while using a DD/R
headset. DD/R headsets are commonly used by starship crews to
access information without changing their primary console displays.

Computer Variants
A computer's optimum technology level is the level at which
it reaches standard production and is no longer considered
a prototype or experiment. Most Computing systems will be
built at the optimal level or higher, to allow utilization of the
most recent software programs. Computers may be built at
lower than optimum tech levels (prototech) or reduced tech
levels (retrotech) discussed below.

Prototech: Prototech: A computer type may be produced at up to 2 levels
below its optimum tech as a prototype (or reverse engineered
experiment). The system has the normal rating but the cost
and weight are multiplied by 10 for construction at one TL
lower, and 100 for construction at 2 Technology Levels lower.

For example, the TL 10 Computer/2 salvaged from a mysterious
alien wreck could be used to reverse engineer a Computer/2 by
a TL 8 society. It would run as a TL 10 Computer/2, but would
cost Cr. 35,000 and weigh 100 kg.

Retrotech: Retrotech: A higher TL society may produce a lower rated TL
system for a reduced cost and weight. Any system may be built
at any TL below the society's current level (but not below the
optimum TL for the model). Each reduced level halves the cost
and weight of the basic model.

For example, an advanced TL 10 society want to produce TL 7
Computer/0 models for sale to less advanced worlds. These
computers could weigh as little as 1.25 kg and would cost 6
Credits each – although the TL 10 society would sell them for a
much higher price, of course. The lightweight machines would
function at a rating of Computer/0 but, if opened up, would
have TL 10 technology inside.

Jump DimmingJump Dimming
The transitions to and from jumpspace are momentous occasions during an interstellar trip. Following an old Vilani superstition, the pilot of a ship customarily dims the
ship's interior and exterior lights before going into jump. Historically, this custom derived from the need for most of the ship's power to be diverted into the computer
and jump drive systems, so that the jump drive could be guided into creating the jump fi eld properly. Zhodani and Solomani pilots do not follow this tradition of 'jump
dimming'. Lights on a ship are typically dimmed for a period of about two minutes; the lights are brought back up to full strength as soon as the ship is in jumpspace.

EEQUIPMENTQUIPMENT EQUIPMENT

DD/Rs can display data from any system, not just computers – they
can display vacc suit oxygen reserves, grav belt status, neural activity
scanner results and so forth. Cr. 5,000.

Data Wafer (TL 10):Data Wafer (TL 10): The principle medium of information storage
in the Imperium is the standard data wafer, a rectangle of hardened
plastic about the size of a credit card. The interface for a data wafer
is standardised but the internal workings vary. A TL 10 data wafer
is memory diamond, with information encoded in structures of
carbon atoms; more advanced wafers use more exotic means of
data storage. Cr 5.

Specialised Computer: Specialised Computer: A computer can be designed for a specific
purpose, which gives it a rating of 1 or 2 higher for that program only.
The navigation computer on a starship might be only a Computer/1,
but it could run the Expert Navigation/3 program because it is
specially designed for that task. A specialized computer costs 25%
more per added rating – so, a Computer/1 (Expert Navigation/3)
machine costs 150% of the cost of a basic Computer/1. In addition,
running the program a computer is specialized for does not use
up rating when working out how many programs the computer
can run simultaneously.

Software
A character can use any high-rating software at a lower rating, to
a minimum of the lowest rating shown. For example, you can run
Intrusion/3 on a Computer/1, but it functions only as Intrusion/1.

Programs above Rating/1 cannot be copied easily, as they require a
non-trivial amount of bandwidth to transfer.

MEDICAL SUPPLIES
Most of these supplies require a character with the Medic skill to use
properly. These items are, in the main, useful only in emergencies,
such as when a character is injured on a distant planet far away from
a hospital facility.

Cryoberth (TL 10):Cryoberth (TL 10): A cryoberth, or 'icebox', is a coffi n-like machine
similar to the low or frozen berths used on some spacecraft. The
main difference is that a cryoberth works much faster than a low
berth, freezing and preserving its occupant almost instantly. A
cryoberth can therefore be used to place a severely injured character
into stasis until he receives medical treatment. While in a cryoberth,
a character's wounds neither heal nor degrade and all disease

Drugs
There are several drugs (or 'meds') in standard use across the
Imperium.

Medicinal Drugs (TL 5+) Medicinal Drugs (TL 5+) include vaccines, antitoxins and antibiotics.
They range in cost from five credits to several thousand credits,
depending on the rarity and complexity of the drug. Medicinal drugs
require the Medic skill to use properly – using the wrong drug can
be worse than doing nothing. There are too many individual drugs
and the effects vary too widely with Technology Level for rules for
each of them, but as a rule of thumb with a successful Medic check

Interfaces and Intellects
Choosing the right program to use your computer is important, and depends on what you are doing with the computer.

If you're just using the computer, then all you need is a basic Interface/0.
If you're using the computer to access an Expert program, then you need Intelligent Interface to get the benefi t.
If you want the computer to do the work for you, then you need to run an Agent program.
If you want the computer to do the work for you with a human-like level of intelligence and adaptability, you want an Intellect program.

Expert Skill Software
Kathya is on her ship, attending to a patient. She has no Medic skill, but her hand computer (Computer/3) has the Medic Expert skill
program at Rating 3. She therefore uses an Intelligent Interface/1 and Expert Medic/2. This gives Kathya an effective Medic skill of 1 for
making this skill check.

Morn has a Wafer Jack. If he takes the Expert Medic program from the computer and inserts the data wafer into his jack, then he gains
Medic 2 as long as the wafer is in his skull.

In either case, the Expert program only allows the character to make Intelligence or Education-based checks. Morn's artifi cial skill could
allow him to diagnose an illness or apply first aid, but if the Referee called for a Dexterity-based check to perform surgery, the program
would be of no help.

A character could, say, connect a neural comm (see page 89) to his hand computer, and use the hand computer to contact a distant
computer that has an appropriate Expert skill – but if the signal was jammed or interrupted, the effects on the character could be
disastrous. Slaving your nervous system to your ship in orbit is generally not a good idea.

Expert Skills and Aiding Characters
Having a tool or weapon with the appropriate Expert program and an Intelligent Interface can give a character a +1 DM to his checks if
he also has the skill in question. However, the program can only help if the diffi culty of the task is less than a certain value.

Expert ProgramExpert Program Helps if the diffi culty is...Helps if the diffi culty is...

the correct drug can counteract most poisons or diseases, or at the
very least give a positive DM towards resisting them. If the wrong
drug is administered, treat it as a Difficult (–2 DM) poison with a
damage of 1d6. (See page 74 for more on poisons.)

Panaceas (TL 8+)Panaceas (TL 8+) are wide-spectrum medicinal drugs that are
specifi cally designed not to interact harmfully. They can therefore
be used on any wound or illness and are guaranteed not to make
things worse. A character using panaceas may make a Medic check
as if he had Medic 0 when treating an infection or disease. Panaceas
cost 200 credits per dose.

Anti-radAnti-rad drugs (TL 8)drugs (TL 8) must be administered before or immediately
after (within ten minutes) radiation exposure. They absorb up to
100 rads per dose (see page 141 for more on radiation). A character
may only use anti-rad drugs once per day – taking any more causes
permanent Endurance damage of 1d6 per dose. Cr. 1,000 per dose.

Stim drugs (TL 8)Stim drugs (TL 8) remove fatigue, at a cost. A character who uses
stim may remove the effects of fatigue (see page 74) but suffers one
point of damage. If stims are used to remove fatigue again without
an intervening period of sleep, the character suffers two points of
damage the second time, three points the third time, and so on.
Stims cost 50 credits per dose.

Metabolic accelerator ('Metabolic accelerator (' Slow Drug', TL 10) Slow Drug', TL 10) boosts the user's
reaction time to superhuman levels. To the user, everyone else
appears to be moving much slower. A character using slow drug
in combat adds +8 to his initiative total at the start of combat (or
whenever the drug takes effect). He may also dodge up to twice
each round with no effect on his initiative score. The drug kicks in
45 seconds (eight rounds) after ingestion or injection and lasts for
around ten minutes. When the drug wears off, the user's system
crashes. He suffers 2d6 points of damage and is exhausted.
Metabolic accelerator costs 500 credits per dose.

Combat Drug (TL 10):Combat Drug (TL 10): This drug increases reaction time and
improves the body's ability to cope with trauma, aiding the user in
combat. A character using a combat drug adds +4 to his initiative
total at the start of combat (or whenever the drug takes effect). He
may also dodge once each round with no effect on his initiative
score and reduces all damage suffered by two points. The drug kicks
in twenty seconds (four rounds) after injection, and lasts around ten
minutes. When the drug wears off, the user is fatigued (see page
74). Combat drugs cost 1,000 credits per dose.

Medicinal Slow (TL 11) Medicinal Slow (TL 11) is a variant of the slow drug. It can only
be applied safely in a medical facility where life-support and cryo
technology is available as it increases the metabolism to around
thirty times normal, allowing a patient to undergo a month of
healing in a single day. (Using medicinal slow outside of a hospital
or sickbay is a messy and painful way to commit suicide, as the
user will rapidly cook his internal organs and suffer massive brain
damage.) Medicinal slow costs 500 credits per dose.

Fast DrugFast Drug (TL 10)(TL 10) or 'Hibernation' puts the user into a state akin to
suspended animation, slowing his metabolic rate down to a ratio of

60 to 1 – a subjective day for the user is actually two months. Fast
drug is normally used to prolong life support reserves or as a cheap
substitute for a cryoberth. Fast drug costs 200 credits per dose.

AnagathicsAnagathics (TL 15)(TL 15) slow the user's aging process. Synthetic
anagathics become possible at TL 15, but there are natural spices
and other rare compounds that have comparable effects at all
Te c h n o l o g y L e v e l s. A n a g a t h i c s a r e i l l e g a l o r h e a v i l y c o n t r o l l e d o n
many worlds. They cost 2,000 Credits per dose. One dose must be
taken each month to maintain the anti-aging effect – if the character
taking anagathics misses a dose they must make an immediate roll
on the aging table (see page 36) as their body reacts badly to the
interrupted supply.

Medical Care
Healing: Healing: An injured character who needs hospital care for a
prolonged period (see Injury and Recovery on page 74) will pay
approximately 100 credits per month per Technology Level. (At
TL 11+ the doctors will just use medicinal slow in most cases and
charge for that instead.) Surgery costs 1d6 50 Technology Level
in Credits.

Replacements: Replacements: A character whose injuries require cloning
limbs or cybernetic replacement must pay 5,000 credits per
Characteristic point.

ROBOTS AND DRONES
The legal status of robots varies across the Imperium. Some
worlds embrace automation and machine intelligence, giving
even comparatively simple artificial minds legal protection or even
citizenship. Others are so restrictive that cyborgs can find themselves
classifi ed as property instead of people. The only difference
between a robot and a drone is that the robot has an Intellect
program running, allowing it to make decisions independently,
while drones are remote-controlled by a character with the
Remote Operations skill.

Robots and drones operate in combat like characters but take damage
as if they were vehicles. They have Hull and Structure characteristics
instead of an Endurance characteristic, and an Endurance DM
of 0. Any robot running an Intellect program has an Intelligence
and Education score. Drones have neither. A robot's Education
characteristic is representative of the information programmed
into it and even low-end robots can have high Education scores.
Most robots have Social Standing characteristics of 0 as they are
not social creations but there are some exceptions, usually high-
end models running advanced Intellect programs. Drones do not
have Social Standing but in cases where they are used to engage
in diplomacy or other social intercourse the operator can use
his own Social Standing score.

Cargo Robot (TL 11): Cargo Robot (TL 11): These simple, heavy-duty robots are found
in starport docks and on board cargo ships. They have enough
intelligence to unload crates but are easily confused by unexpected
situations. When confused they shut down unless given direct

commands, to ensure they don't accidentally damage anything with
their massive strength. Cargo drones can be constructed as low
as Technology Level 9 but their utility is extremely limited until the
invention of Intellect programs.

Combat Drone (TL 12): Combat Drone (TL 12): Combat drones are little more than flying
guns mated to a grav floater and a computer system. The most
common combat drone mounts a PGMP or assault rifle but
any weapon can be mounted and many makes of combat drone
feature a modular arrangement that makes changing the gun a
straightforward Intelligence check. The drones must be piloted
with the Remote Operations skill but attacks are made using the
appropriate weapon skill. Combat drones loaded with Intellect
and combat Expert programs (making them autonomous combat
robots) are illegal on many worlds.

Integral System:Integral System: Certain devices can be built into drones or robots
by increasing the cost of the device by +50%. Popular choices
include toolkits of different kinds (see opposite), various sensors,
or mobility upgrades like thruster packs or grav floaters.

Integral Weapon: Integral Weapon: Any suitable weapon can be added to a drone or
robot, at the cost of Cr. 10,000 + the cost of the weapon.

SENSORS
Most sensors are designed to be plugged into a computer system,
but can display the data directly to the user on built-in screens or by
feeding it to the user's suit display. At TL 11 sensors become notably
more discriminating because they can be hooked up to a system
running Intellect/1 that can dynamically fi lter information based on
pre-set parameters – not sounding the alarm if the motion sensor
picks up anything too small to be an intruder, for example.

Generally speaking, sensor equipment does not offer a bonus to skill
checks but allows the user to find things that they would otherwise
not be able to.

Binoculars (TL 3): Binoculars (TL 3): Allows the user to see further. 1 kg, Cr. 75. At
TL 8 electronic enhancement allows images to be captured; light-
intensifi cation allows them to be used in the dark. Cr 750. At TL
12 PRIS (Portable Radiation Imaging System) allows the user
to observe a large section of the EM-spectrum, from infrared to
gamma rays. Cr 3,500.

Geiger Counter (TL 5): Geiger Counter (TL 5): Detects radiation, both presence and
approximate intensity. Cr. 250. The Sensors skill is not needed to
detect the presence of radiation with a Geiger counter but anything
more complex than that requires a check.

IR Goggles (TL 6): IR Goggles (TL 6): Permits the user to see exothermic (heat-emitting)
sources in the dark. Cr. 500.

Light-Intensifying Goggles (TL 7): Light-Intensifying Goggles (TL 7): Permits the user to see normally
in anything less than total darkness by electronically intensifying any
available light. Cr. 500.

At TL 9, IR goggles and light-intensifying goggles can be combined
into a single unit costing Cr. 1,250.

Motion Sensor (TL 7):Motion Sensor (TL 7): A motion sensor simply detects any and all

movement within the area assigned to it. It cannot differentiate
between kinds of movement, it just reports whether there is
movement or not in an area roughly six meters in diameter. Cr.

500. At TL 9 the motion detector can report the general qualities
of motion – size, speed and duration – but no more. Cr. 1,000. The
Sensors skill is not required to use a motion detector to detect
motion. When trying to interpret data from a TL 9 motion sensor,
the Sensors skill may need to be checked.

Electromagnetic Probe (TL 10): Electromagnetic Probe (TL 10): This handy device detects the
electromagnetic emissions of technological devices, and can be
used as a diagnostic tool when examining equipment (+1 DM to
work out what's wrong with it) or when searching for hidden bugs
or devices. Cr 1,000. The Sensors or Investigation skills can be used
to sweep a room for bugs.

Densitometer (TL 14): Densitometer (TL 14): The remote densitometer uses an object's
natural gravity to measure its density, building up a three-
dimensional image of the inside and outside of an object. 5 kg.
Cr. 20,000.

Bioscanner (TL 15): Bioscanner (TL 15): The bioscanner 'sniffs' for organic molecules
and tests chemical samples, analysing the make-up of whatever
it is focussed on. It can be used to detect poisons or bacteria,
analyse organic matter, search for life signs and classify unfamiliar
organisms. 3.5 kg. Cr. 350,000. The data from a bioscanner can be
interpreted using the Sensors or the Life Sciences (biology) skills.

NAS (TL 15): NAS (TL 15): This device consists of a backpack and detachable
handheld unit, and can detect neural activity up to 500 meters away.
The device can also give a rough estimation of the intelligence
level of organisms based on brainwave patterns. 10 kg. Cr 35,000.
The data from a neural activity scanner can be interpreted using
the Sensors, the Life Sciences (biology) or the Social Sciences
(sophontology) skills.

SURVIVAL GEAR AND SUPPLIES
On worlds and places hostile to human life, characters must
use environmental suits to protect themselves. If colonies are
established on such worlds, then the Imperium usually begins a
terraforming process to transform the planet and make it more
Earth-like. Terraforming takes decades, even millennia, and is
a ferociously expensive and intensive process. Sometimes, it
is easier to remake the colonists to fit the world using genetic
engineering and surgery.

The TL 7 tent can be pressurised. There is no airlock – the tent is
depressurised when opened. Cr 2,000.

Rebreather (TL 6):Rebreather (TL 6): The rebreather is a bulky backpack containing
breathable atmosphere and a face mask that collects exhaled gasses
and 'scrubs' them back into breathable gasses again. A rebreather

provides six hours of breathable atmosphere and can be used to
breathe in any environment that is not otherwise harmful, such as
underwater. 10 kg, Cr. 250.

Respirator (TL 6): Respirator (TL 6): This device concentrates inhaled oxygen, allowing
a character to breathe on worlds with a thin atmosphere (see page
171). Respirators take the form of a face mask or mouthpiece initially.
Cr. 100. The more advanced TL 10 respirator is small enough to fit
into the nose, or can even be a lung implant for 3 cost. Cr. 2,000.

Filter (TL 7): Filter (TL 7): Filters are breathing masks that strip out harmful
elements from the air inhaled by the character, such as dangerous
gases or dust particles. Cr 100. The TL 10 fi lter is small enough to fit
into the nose, or can even be a lung implant for 3 cost. Cr. 2,000.

Breather Mask (TL 8): Breather Mask (TL 8): Combines the fi lter and respirator into a
single package. Cr. 150.

Artifi cial Gill (TL 8): Artifi cial Gill (TL 8): Extracts oxygen from water allowing the wearer
to breathe underwater. Only works on worlds with breathable
atmospheres (type 4–9 – see page 171). 4 kg. Cr 4,000.

Environment Suit (TL 8): Environment Suit (TL 8): Designed to protect the wearer from
extreme cold or heat, the environment suit has a hood, gloves and
boots but leaves the face exposed in normal operations. A mask or
rebreather can be attached, but truly hostile situations call for the
heavy-duty HEV suit (see page 87). Costs Cr 500.

Habitat Module (TL 8): Habitat Module (TL 8): A modular, unpressurised quarters for six
people, capable of withstanding anything less than hurricane-force
winds. Includes survival rations and enough batteries to keep the
lights on and the heaters (or air conditioning) running for a week.
Requires 12 man-hours to assemble, and can be attached to other
modules to form a base. Cr 10,000. The TL 10 module is pressurised,
and includes life-support for six occupants for one week (1000
person/hours). Cr 20,000.

Rescue Bubble (TL 9): Rescue Bubble (TL 9): A large (2m diameter) pressurised plastic
bubble. Piezoelectric layers in the bubble wall translate the user's
movements into electricity to recharge the bubble's batteries and
power its distress beacon, and a small oxygen tank both inflates
the bubble and provides two person/hours of life support. A self-
repairing plastic seal serves as an emergency airlock. Rescue
bubbles are found on both space and sea vessels as emergency
lifeboats. Cr. 600.

Thruster Pack (TL 9):Thruster Pack (TL 9): A simple thruster pack gives the user the
ability to maneuver in zero-gravity. A Zero-G check is required
to use a thruster pack accurately. Thruster packs can only be used
in microgravity environments and are only practical for journeys
between spacecraft (or other objects) at Adjacent range (see page
146). Cr. 2,000.

At TL 12 the long-range thruster pack gives 0.1g acceleration for up
to 48 hours, using standard starship fuel. This increases its practical
range on the spacecraft scale to Short but gives it a weight of 10

kg. Cr. 14,000. The TL 14 version of the long-range pack is much
smaller as it uses grav-thruster plates instead, but has the same
performance profi le as the TL 12 version. Cr. 20,000.

Portable Generator (TL 10): Portable Generator (TL 10): This is a heavy-duty portable fusion
generator, capable of recharging weapons and other equipment for
up to one month of use. Cr. 500,000.

Options
Self-Assembling (TL 11): Self-Assembling (TL 11): The self-assembling upgrade can be given
to tents, habitat modules and other basic structures. The structure
is capable of expanding and assembling itself with only minimal aid,
reducing the time needed to set up the shelter to a single man-hour.
Cr. 5,000.

Self-Sealing (TL 13): Self-Sealing (TL 13): Structures can be made self-repairing and
self-sealing at TL 13 for Cr. 2,000. Small breaches and rips are
automatically fi xed in seconds.

WEAPONS
With the advent of powered armor and portable fusion generators,
the line between 'personal weapon' and 'heavy artillery' is blurred.
The high-end weapons available in the Imperium are staggeringly
powerful. Few private citizens can obtain such weapons legally but
small brush wars can turn into alarming plasma-fi red, city-razing
conflagrations when mercenaries are involved.

Weapons are described with the following statistics:

TL:TL: The lowest Technology Level at which the weapon is available.
Range:Range: The range modifi ers used for that weapon (see page 64).
Damage:Damage: The damage the weapon inflicts.
Auto:Auto: The Auto rating of the weapon if it is capable of automatic fi re
(see page 62).
Recoil:Recoil: The Recoil rating of the weapon (see page 61).
Mass:Mass: The amount, in kilograms, that the weapon weighs on a world
with Earth-like gravity.
Magazine:Magazine: The number of shots the weapon can take before needing
to be reloaded or connected to a new power pack. Unless specified
otherwise in the weapon's description it takes only a single minor
action to reload or two to switch to a new power pack.
Cost:Cost: The weapon's cost in credits.

Melee Weapons
Melee weapons are a symbol of status among the Imperium's
nobility, but they also serve a useful purpose in boarding actions.
When attempting to capture an enemy vessel, a sword is much less
likely to cause signifi cant damage to vulnerable systems or cause a
hull breach than a gun but is better at opening a self-sealing vacc
suit to the airless cold of space.

Blade: Blade: A hybrid knife weapon, somewhere between a dagger and a
cutlass, with a large basket hilt.

Broadsword: Broadsword: A heavy two-handed sword.

Cutlass: Cutlass: The standard shipboard blade weapon, often kept near
airlocks to repel boarders.

Rapier: Rapier: A duelling foil. A character using a rapier increases their
effective Melee (large blade) skill by one level when parrying.

Club: Club: Humanity's fi rst weapon. Whether a handy length of metal
piping or an extending riot baton made of advanced polymers, the
club remains a popular and practical weapon wherever intelligent
species gather.

Dagger: Dagger: A small knife weapon, approximately 20 centimeters in
length. Daggers are especially suited to close-quarters combat

- while grappling (see page 64) someone armed with a dagger can
do Effect + 4 damage if they choose to hurt their opponent.

Improvised Weapon:Improvised Weapon: When there's no real weapon available and
your bare hands just aren't enough, any snatched-up object can be
used as an impromptu club.

Shield: Shield: A character using a shield increases their effective Melee

(unarmed) skill by one level when parrying. A character with no
Melee counts as having Melee 0 when using a shield to parry.

Staff: Staff: A length of wood or metal that can be used in a variety of
combat styles, to aid walking, or to poke potentially dangerous
things from a distance.

Stunstick: Stunstick: This melee weapon deals 2d6 stun damage in addition
to its normal damage. A character struck by a stun stick must make
an Endurance check with a negative DM equal to the stun damage
(after armor is subtracted). If this Endurance check is failed, the
character is knocked unconscious.

Slug Throwers
Despite advances in energy weapons and other offensive
technologies, accelerating a small piece of metal to a high velocity
is still one of the most efficient ways of killing someone. Chemically
propelled fi rearms give way to gyrojet (rocket bullets) and gauss
(electromagnetically launched bullets) as technology advances.

Accelerator Rifl e: Accelerator Rifle: Also known as gyrojet weapons, accelerator rifles
are designed for zero-gravity combat. They fi re tiny missiles that
leave the rifle with minimal velocity and thus minimal recoil, then
accelerate to high speed.

Advanced Combat Rifl e (Advanced Combat Rifle ( ACR): ACR): The ultimate evolution of the
conventional fi rearm, advanced combat rifles are the weapon of
choice for many military units. Standard equipment includes an
electronic battlefi eld sight, incorporating both light amplification and
IR abilities (see page 96), visual magnifi cation up to 5x zoom, and a
laser rangefi nder which may also be used as a target painting device
(reveals exact distance to target). The weapon is also gyroscopically
stabilized during fi ring (as a gyroscopic stabilizer, already included
in the stats).

Antique Pistol: Antique Pistol: A flintlock or other primitive projectile weapon.
Unless the weapon is especially well made, it will have a –1 DM to

attacks. Antique pistols require three minor actions and a successful
Gun Combat (slug pistol) check to reload. Failure means you have
to start again.

Antique Rifl e: Antique Rifle: A musket or other primitive rifle. Unless the weapon
is especially well made, it will have a –1 DM to attacks. Antique rifles
require three minor actions and a successful Gun Combat (slug
rifle) check to reload. Failure means you have to start again.

Assault Rifl e: Assault Rifle: Assault rifles fi re lighter projectiles than rifles, but are
capable of a higher rate of fire and are more suitable to short-range
encounters.

Autopistol:Autopistol: Variants of this semi-automatic pistol are the standard
sidearm for law enforcement offi cers and criminals across the
Imperium.

Autorifl e: Autorifle: Automatic rifles have a higher muzzle velocity and are
capable of automatic fi re. Also termed battle rifles.

Body Pistol: Body Pistol: Body pistols are manufactured from plastics and cultured
bone, making them very diffi cult to detect using conventional
weapons scanners. Body pistols increase the difficulty of Sensors
checks to detect them to Very Diffi cult (–4).

Gauss Rifl e: Gauss Rifle: Gauss rifles replace conventional rifles at TL 13. Like
the smaller gauss pistol, rifles fi re high-velocity projectiles using
electromagnetic rails.

Gauss Pistol: Gauss Pistol: Gauss pistols use electromagnetic coils to accelerate
metallic darts to hypersonic speeds. Gauss weapons are lightweight,
effi cient and deadly.

Revolver: Revolver: A conventional six-
shooter handgun. Revolvers
take two minor actions to
reload.

Rifl e: Rifle: A long-range hunting rifle or light infantry weapon. Reloading
a rifle requires two minor actions.

Shotgun: Shotgun: Shotguns are smoothbore weapons that typically fire
ammunition consisting of multiple small pellets. They are most
effective at shorter ranges. A shotgun using pellet ammunition
ignores Dodge dice modifiers, but Armor gives double protection
against pellet attacks. A shotgun can also fire solid slugs, which
follow all the normal rules for shooting.

EQUIPMENT EQUIPMENT

Snub Pistol: Snub Pistol: These lightweight, low-recoil weapons were designed
for use aboard spacecraft and in zero gravity.

Energy Weapons
Directed-energy weapons fi rst enter the battlefi eld as target
designators and range-fi nders, but by TL 9 weapons capable of
inflicting damage directly appear. Laser weapons require a power
supply – pistols come with a belt- or wrist-mounted power pack,
while rifles come with backpacks connected by a cable. In addition
to their damage, a laser that hits with Effect 6+ will permanently
blind its target unless they are wearing some sort of eye protection.

Laser Carbine: Laser Carbine: Laser carbines are shorter and lighter than laser
rifles, and have a correspondingly shorter range.

Laser Pistol: Laser Pistol: The TL 9 pistol is bulky, but effective, with no recoil
and a large magazine. At TL 11, advances in battery technology
and miniaturization mean that the pistol is no larger than a
conventional fi rearm, but must still be connected to a battery pack
for sustained use.

Laser Rifl e: Laser Rifle: Laser rifles are highly accurate at long range. They are
powered by heavy backpacks, although they have an internal battery
that can store enough energy for six shots for mobile sniping.

Plasma Rifl e: Plasma Rifle: TL 16 technology allows the bulky reactor and plasma
chamber of the PGMP to be made small enough to fit into a rifle
frame. The plasma rifle is a high-power sniper weapon designed to
crack Battle Dress. Because of its internal reactor it never runs out
of ammunition.

Stunners: Stunners: Stun weapons are non-lethal and do not inflict normal
damage. A character struck by a stun weapon must make an
Endurance check with a negative DM equal to the damage (after
armor is subtracted). If this Endurance check is failed the
character is knocked unconscious. If the Endurance check is

Reloading Energy Weapons
All energy weapons come with a power pack that can be
recharged using a ship's power plant or another power source.
It takes eight hours to recharge a power pack. Extra power packs
can be purchased at the listed cost. Switching from one pack to
another takes two minor actions.

EQUIPMENT EQUIPMENT

successful, the character is unaffected by the weapon and the stun
damage is ignored.

Grenades
Aerosol: Aerosol: Aerosol grenades create a fine mist six meters in radius
that diffusess lasers but does not block normal vision. Any laser
attack made through the mist has its damage reduced by 10. Laser
communications through the mist are completely blocked. The mist
dissipates in 1d6 3 rounds, although high winds and other extreme
weather can sharply reduce this time.

Frag: Frag: The damage from fragmentation grenades decreases with
distance from the blast:

DistanceDistance DamageDamage
3 meters 5d6
6 meters 3d6
9 meters 1d6

Smoke: Smoke: Smoke grenades create a thick cloud of smoke six meters in
radius, centered on the location of the grenade. This smoke imposes
a –2 DM on all attacks within or through the cloud (doubled for
laser weapons). Smoke dissipates in 1d6 3 rounds, although high
winds and other extreme weather can sharply reduce this time.

Stun: Stun: Stun weapons are non-lethal and do not infl ict normal damage.
A character struck by a stun weapon must make an Endurance
check with a negative DM equal to the damage (after armor is
subtracted). If this Endurance check is failed the character is knocked
unconscious. If the Endurance check is successful, the character is
unaffected by the weapon and the stun damage is ignored.

Heavy Weapons
Grenade Launcher: Grenade Launcher: Grenade launchers are used to fire grenades
over long distances.

RAM Grenade Launcher: RAM Grenade Launcher: Rocket Assisted Multi-purpose grenade
launchers have a longer range and are capable of firing up to three
grenades with a single attack. This uses the rules for firing on full
auto (see page 62); unlike other weapons with an Auto score, a
RAM grenade launcher cannot fi re in burst mode. It takes two minor
actions to reload a RAM grenade launcher.

Rocket Launcher: Rocket Launcher: The poor man's FGMP. To counteract the recoil
of the weapon, a rocket launcher channels exhaust backwards in
an explosive backblast. Anyone up to 1.5 meters behind a rocket
launcher when it fi res takes 3d6 damage from the burning gasses.
Vehicle-mounted rocket launchers lose this side-effect as a vehicle
is a more stable fi ring platform than a person. It takes three minor
actions to reload a rocket launcher.

EQUIPMENT EQUIPMENT

The rockets presented are high-explosive models. Do not add the
Effect of the attack roll to their damage but apply that damage
to everything within six meters of the impact point. A rocket that
misses has a 50% chance (4+ on 1d6) of detonating upon impact
with the ground (6 – Effect meters away in a random direction).
Otherwise it will miss completely and leave the battlefield without
striking anything or detonating. Of course, if used indoors or
in a similarly enclosed space a rocket has to strike something

- the Referee is free to determine how much collateral damage
is inflicted and on what.

PGMP: PGMP: The Plasma Gun, Man Portable is the standard heavy
assault weapon of the marines. It is so heavy and bulky that it
can only be used easily by a trooper with a Strength of 12 or
more – usually attained by wearing battle dress. Every point by
which a user's Strength falls short is a –1 DM on any attack rolls
made with it. It is powered by a built-in micro-fusion generator
and fi res a high-energy plasma stream or a hail of plasma bolts.
More advanced plasma guns adjust the weapon's optimum range
and plasma temperature.

FGMP: FGMP: The ultimate personal firearm, the Fusion Gun, Man Portable
is more like a piece of artillery. It includes a gravity suspension
system to reduce its inertia, making it easier to use than the PGMP
(minimum Strength 9) and fi res what amounts to a directed nuclear
explosion. Those without radiation protection who are nearby when
a FGMP is fi red will suffer a lethal dose of radiation – each fi ring of
an FGMP emits 2d6 20 rads, which will affect everyone within the
immediate vicinity. (See page 141 for the effect of rads.)

Explosives
The Explosives skill is used with explosives – the Effect of the
Explosives skill check multiplies the damage, with a minimum of 1
damage for an Effect of 0 or 1.

Plastic: Plastic: This generic, multi-purpose plastic explosive is a favorite of
military units, terrorists, demolition teams and adventurers across
known space.

TDX: TDX: An advanced gravity-polarised explosive, TDX explodes only
along the horizontal axis.

Pocket Nuke: Pocket Nuke: Hideously illegal on many worlds, the pocket nuke
is actually the size of a briefcase and so is too large to fit into a
grenade launcher.

Options
Grenade Launcher (TL 8): Grenade Launcher (TL 8): An underslung RAM grenade launcher can
be added to any rifle at the cost of 1,000 Cr. This grenade launcher
has a magazine of one grenade, cannot fire on automatic and takes
four minor actions to reload.

Laser Sight (TL 8): Laser Sight (TL 8): Integrated optics and laser sights give an extra
+1 DM bonus to any attack that has been aimed (see page 61 for
the aim action). Cr 100. At TL 10, x-ray lasers and improved display
technology removes the tell-tale 'red dot' of a vislight laser. Cr 200.

Silencer (TL 8): Silencer (TL 8): A silencer can be added to any slug thrower with
Auto 4 or less, masking the sound produced by firing. (–4 DM to
detect.) Cr. 250.

Gyrostabilizer (TL 9): Gyrostabilizer (TL 9): Stabilizers can be added to any weapon with
recoil, reducing the recoil by one point at the cost of 300 credits.

Secure Weapon (TL 10): Secure Weapon (TL 10): A secure weapon requires authentication in
some fashion (scanning the user's DNA or iris patterns, entering a
password, transmission of an unlocking code from a comm) before
it can be fi red. Cr. 100.

Serious Firepower
The PGMP and FGMP are weapons of such unbelievable
destructive potential that they are never deployed without due
care and forethought – except by player characters.

- Everything counts as soft cover against these weapons.
    Only specially reinforced and upgraded materials can
    withstand the power of a PGMP or FGMP well enough to
    be considered hard cover.
- If a shot from a PGMP or FGMP kills a target, continue the
    line of fi re and apply any remaining damage to whatever
    it hits next. Keep doing this until you run out of damage.
    Te c h n i c a l l y a l l fi r e a r m s c a n o v e r p e n e t r a t e i n t h i s w a y b u t
    it is only at this level of firepower that it becomes worth
    keeping track of.

Erik's Custom Gun
Erik isn't satisfi ed with any of the guns here, and wants something
a bit more stylish. He starts with the basic autopistol and adds
a gyrostabilizer and laser sight to it. He then adds the TL 13
intelligent weapon modification, giving his gun Computer/1.
Computer/1 only allows him to run a single rating/1 program
on the gun, but there's the specialized computer modification
in the computer options section. Erik chooses to put Gun
Combat (slug pistols) specialization 2 onto his gun, giving it
the ability to count as Rating/3 for Expert Gun Combat (slug
pistols) programs. With a Rating/1 Intellect and a Rating/2
Expert Gun Combat (slug pistols), Erik's gun can fi re itself
with a skill of 1. Of course, a gun has no Dexterity (effectively
Dexterity 0) so it will have a total DM of –2 before other
modifi ers are taken into account. It can also aid Erik when firing,
giving him a +1 DM to his attacks as long as the difficulty is
less than Very Diffi cult (–4).

VEHICLES
All vehicles have the following traits:
TL: TL: The lowest Technology Level that the vehicle is available at.
Skill: Skill: What skill is used to drive or pilot the vehicle.
Agility: Agility: How easy the vehicle is to drive, expressed as a DM to the
pilot's skill check.
Speed: Speed: The vehicle's maximum speed.
Crew and Passengers: Crew and Passengers: How many people the vehicle can carry.
Open/Closed:Open/Closed: If the vehicle is open or closed (see page 66).
Armor: Armor: How much armor the vehicle has. Damage sustained by a
vehicle is reduced by its armor.
Hull/Structure: Hull/Structure: The number of hits the vehicle can sustain before
being disabled. See Vehicle Combat, page 66.
Weapons: Weapons: What weapons the vehicle has, if any, and what fi re arcs
they are in.

Air/Raft: Air/Raft: An open-topped vehicle supported by anti-gravity
technology. Air/rafts can even reach orbit but passengers at that
altitude must wear vacc suits. They are ubiquitous, remarkably
reliable and flexible vehicles.

Ground Car: Ground Car: A conventional wheeled automobile.

AFV: AFV: A heavily armored ATV, known as an Armored Fighting
Vehicle, equipped with a triple laser turret. The lasers use the Gun
Combat (energy rifle) skill, do 4d6 damage each using the Ranged

EQUIPMENT

ATV: ATV: An enclosed, pressurised all-terrain ground vehicle. The
vehicle is capable of floating on calm water, and has a suite of
built-in sensors and communications equipment (usually a laser
transceiver) making it ideal for exploration. An ATV has a hardpoint
for a turret, but does not come with a weapon normally.

G/Carrier: G/Carrier: A grav carrier is effectively a fl ying tank, and is the standard
fighting vehicle of many military forces across the Imperium. The
turret-mounted fusion gun is a vehicle-mounted version of the TL 15
FGMP and uses the same 'serious fi repower' rules (see opposite).
Advanced containment systems mean that it does not leak radiation
with each shot in the same way as the man-portable version.

Grav Belt: Grav Belt: A grav belt resembles a parachute harness, and is fitted
with artifi cial gravity modules allowing the wearer to fly. The internal
battery can operate for a maximum of four hours before needing to
be recharged. At TL 15, the battery can operate for 12 hours before
charging. Options cannot be added to the grav belt.

Grav Floater:Grav Floater: A grav fl oater is a forerunner of the grav belt, a platform
upon which a single person can stand and be carried along. It cannot
achieve any great speed but can, like an air/raft, achieve any altitude
up to orbit.

Options
With the exception of on-board computer, each of these options can
only be taken once on a given vehicle.

Autopilot (TL 11):Autopilot (TL 11): an autopilot has a Computer/1 specialized to run
Intellect/1 and an Expert/1 in an appropriate skill and specialty. This
will be in addition to any other computers installed. An autopilot
is often mandatory on cheaper commercial models. In many
areas (primarily urban) they are required to be in use. Higher Law
Level polities (see page 173) may require a slave modifi cation to
the autopilot for centralized and/or emergency traffi c control.
Cr 3,000.

Enclosed:Enclosed: This modifi cation turns an open vehicle into a closed one.
It costs 10% of the base cost of the vehicle, reduces Agility by 1 and
top speed by 10%.

Extended Life Support: Extended Life Support: A vehicle which is sealed can be equipped for
extended life support, which increases the duration to 18 hours per
person. Costs another 10% of the base cost of the vehicle.

Heavy Armor: Heavy Armor: Increasing the armor of a vehicle by 5 adds 25% to
the cost of the vehicle.

Encumbrance
Tr a v e l l e r characters sometimes have to carry everything they
need to survive. A character can carry a number of kilograms
equal to their Strength + Endurance scores before they have to
worry about their load. They are lightly encumbered if they carry
up to twice this value and heavily encumbered if they carry up
to three times their Strength + Endurance. A character can lift
more with an Athletics (strength) check – add the Effect to his
effective Strength to work out his new maximum lift – but cannot
do more than stagger around with his new load at 1.5 meters per
round. He may lift it for a number of rounds equal to the Effect
of an Athletics (endurance) check.

Lightly encumbered characters suffer a –1 DM to all actions
that require free physical movement and become fatigued after
a number of minutes equal to their Endurance score (plus the
Effect of an Athletics (endurance) check if the character wishes
to push himself ).

Heavily encumbered characters suffer a –3 DM to all actions
that require free physical movement and become fatigued after
a number of rounds equal to their Endurance score (plus the
Effect of an Athletics (endurance) check if the character wishes
to push himself ).

If a character makes an Athletics check to push his ability to bear
a load in any way, he immediately becomes fatigued when the
duration expires. For more on fatigue, see page 74.

High Performance: High Performance: A vehicle can be made into a high-performance
vehicle, increasing its top speed by 20%. The vehicle costs 50%
more.

On-board Computer: On-board Computer: Adding an on-board computer costs the same
as a hand computer.

Sealed: Sealed: This option can be added to any closed vehicle (it is included
in the ATV, AFV and G/Carrier). The vehicle can be sealed and
provides life support for its passengers and crew for two hours per
person. This option adds 20% to the cost of the vehicle.

Style: Style: Allows a vehicle to be customised to the buyer's wishes.
Costs Cr 200 to Cr 2,000.

EQUIPMENT

### SSPACECRAFTPACECRAFT D DESIGNESIGN

Spacecraft are constructed and sold at shipyards throughout the
galaxy. Any class A starport has a shipyard which can build any kind
of ship, including a starship with Jump drives; any class B starport
can build small craft and ships which do not have Jump drives. The
military procures spaceships through these yards, corporations buy
their commercial craft from these shipyards, and private individuals
can purchase ships that they have designed through them as well.
The major restriction on the purchase of ships is money. Ships
designed using the system presented here are constructed using
off-the-shelf parts that are common throughout the Imperium.
Rules for spacecraft using a restricted technology base or cutting-
edge technology will be presented in future supplements.

DESIGN CHECKLIST

1. Choose a Hull.
a. Choose Hull confi guration.
b. Optionally, install armor.
2a. Decide what the cruising acceleration for the ship should
    be, and cross-reference it with the ship's tonnage on the
    Performance by Hull Volume table to determine the Maneuver
    Drive required.
2b. Optionally, decide what the maximum Jump range for the ship
    should be, and cross-reference it with the ship's tonnage on
    the Performance by Hull Volume to determine the Jump Drive
    required.
3. Choose a Power Plant, ensuring that it can provide enough
    power for the Jump and Maneuver Drives.
4. Work out fuel requirements and allocate space to fuel.
5. Install a bridge.
6. Install a computer.
a. Install computer software. If a Jump drive is installed,
    then the ship needs Jump Control software.
7. Install sensors.
8. Install staterooms and low berths.
9. Optionally, install other components like vehicles, fuel
    processors or drones.
10. Optionally, install turrets, bays or screens.
a. Install one ton of fire control equipment per turret or bay.
11. Optionally, install weapons.
a. Missile launchers and sandcasters require ammunition.
12. Any remaining space can be allocated to cargo.

Design Considerations
Spacecraft are constructed on the foundation of a hull, into which
are fi tted the jump and maneuver drives and power plant, the fuel
tanks, staterooms for the crew, computers, controls and sensors.
Optionally, other components such as armaments, defensive
systems, and other fi ttings can be added to adapt the ship to its
intended function. The total tonnage of the installed fittings cannot
exceed the tonnage of the hull.

Definitions
A spacecraftspacecraft is any interplanetary or interstellar vehicle – anything
that can travel through space under its own power. A shipship is any
vessel of 100 tons or more. A starshipstarship is a ship which has Jump
drives and can travel on interstellar voyages from star system
to star system. A system system shipship is a ship without Jump drives,
confi ned to a single star system. Small Small craftcraft are any vessel
under 100 tons; all small craft are incapable of Jump and are
constructed using their own rules which will be presented in a
future supplement. In the meantime, the statistics for common
small craft can be found on page 132.

Size is measured in 'displacement 'displacement tons'tons' or d-tons: a hundred-
ton ship displaces a volume equal to one hundred tons of liquid
hydrogen (one d-ton equals roughly 14 cubic meters).

Standard Designs vs New Designs
Some ship designs have been used by the Imperium for
centuries, and have become standards across the stars. Plans
for such spacecraft are freely available and components can
be purchased in bulk by shipyards reducing the cost of the
ship's construction by 10%. This reduced cost does not include
ammunition for weapons or fuel, which must be bought – at full
price – separately of the ship. If a buyer needs a new type of ship,
then he must employ a ship architect to design it. The architect's
fees are usually 1% of the fi nal cost of the ship.

ConstructionTimes
Construction times vary wildly, depending on the size and
complexity of the spacecraft and the capabilities of the shipyard.
On average, assume that it takes one day per million credits to
build a spacecraft at a small commercial shipyard.

Hulls are identifi ed by their displacement, expressed in tons.

300 tons 3 12

1,400 tons E 140
1,600 tons G 160
1,800 tons J 180
2,000 tons L 200

Configuration
A ship may have any of three configurations – standard (a wedge,
cone, sphere or cylinder), streamlined (a wing, disc or other lifting
body allowing it to enter the atmosphere easily) or distributed (made
up of several sections, and incapable of entering an atmosphere or
maintaining its shape under gravity).

StreamliningStreamlining a ship increases the cost of the hull by 10%. This
streamlining includes fuel scoops which allow the skimming of
unrefi ned fuel from gas giants or the gathering of water from open
lakes or oceans. Streamlining may not be retrofitted; it must be
included at the time of construction.

A distributeddistributed ship reduces the cost of its hull by 10%. It is completely
non-aerodynamic and if it enters an atmosphere or strong gravity it
runs the risk of falling to the surface of the planet. It cannot mount
fuel scoops.

A standardstandard-hull ship may still enter atmosphere but is very ungainly
and ponderous, capable only of making a controlled glide to the
surface. Getting it back into space requires an elaborate launch
setup and considerable expense. A standard-hull ship may have
scoops for gathering fuel from a gas giant but the process will be
much more diffi cult and less effi cient. Larger ships of this type
will often carry a specialized sub-craft (such as a modular cutter,
see page 135) to perform the actual atmospheric skimming. See
Atmospheric Operations on page 137.

Armor
The basic hull provides some protection from anti-ship weapons
fire but it is possible to add heavier armors to the hull for added
defence. Armor is added in 5% increments of the ship's tonnage.

Armor TypeArmor Type TLTL ProtectionProtection CostCost
Titanium Steel 7 2 per 5% 5% of base hull
Crystaliron 10 4 per 5% 20% of base hull
Bonded Superdense 14 6 per 5% 50% of base hull

For example, a heavily armored warship might take Bonded
Superdense armor twice. This would take up 10% of the hull's
volume and cost 100% of the base cost of the hull, but give 12
points of armor.

Options
Refl ec (TL 10):Reflec (TL 10): Refl ec coating on the hull increases the ship's armor
against lasers by 3. Adding Reflec costs 0.1 Megacredits per ton of
hull and can only be added once.

Self-Sealing (TL 9):Self-Sealing (TL 9): A self-sealing hull automatically repairs minor
breaches such as micrometeoroid impacts, and prevents hull hits
from leading to explosive decompression. It costs 0.01 Megacredits
per ton of hull.

Stealth (TL 11):Stealth (TL 11): A stealth coating absorbs radar and lidar beams,
and also disguises heat emissions. This gives a –4 DM on any
Sensors rolls to detect or lock onto the ship. Adding Stealth costs
0.1 Megacredits per ton of hull, and can only be added once.

Hull and Structure
In combat, damage to a ship is tracked using Hull and Structure
Points. Initial damage is applied to the Hull; once the Hull
is breached, further damage goes to the Structure. When all
Structure Points have been lost, the ship has been smashed
to pieces (but most spacecraft will surrender or be disabled or
destroyed by secondary effects before their Structure is completely
eliminated). A ship has one Hull Point and one Structure Point per
50 tons of displacement.

THE ENGINEERING SECTION
Drives and the Power Plant are installed in the engineering section.

- A non-starship must have a maneuver drive and a power
    plant.
- A starship must have a Jump drive and a power plant; a
    maneuver drive may also be installed, but is not required.

The prices and masses of drives and power plants are described on
the drives and power plants table. It is important to note from the

Redundant Systems
The same component can be installed multiple times – a ship
can carry a backup computer, a backup power plant and so forth.
Only one such system can be used at any time, with the exception
of armaments. Backup systems come online automatically when
the primary system is disabled. Once all backup systems have
been disabled, further hits start destroying systems, starting
with the primary system.

Hulls vary in their requirements for drives and power plants based
on tonnage. Any specific drive will be less effi cient as the tonnage
it must drive increases. The drive potential table lists 24 standard
drive types, identifi ed by the letters A through Z (omitting I and
O to avoid confusion). Also listed are various tonnage levels for
hulls; any tonnage which exceeds a listed level should be read at
the next higher level. Correlating hull size with drive letter indicates
drive potential. If a – is listed, then that combination of drive and
hull is not permitted.

- For maneuver drives, the potential is the Thrust number (Tn),
    which is the number of Gs acceleration available.
- For Jump drives, the potential is the Jump number (Jn), or Jump
    range in parsecs.

The power plant rating (A-Z) must be at least equal to either the
maneuver drive or Jump drive rating, whichever is higher.

For example, a 500 ton ship outfi tted with a Jump drive C and a
maneuver Drive N would have a Thrust of 5 and a Jump of 1. It
would require a power plant N to operate, equal to the higher rating
of the two drives.

Fuel
To t a l f u e l s t o r a g e f o r a s h i p m u s t b e i n d i c a t e d i n t h e d e s i g n p l a n s.
There is no cost, but the capacity does influence how often the
ship must refuel. Ships in Tr a v e l l e r use the same fuel – hydrogen

- to power both the Jump drive and the power plant – the main
difference is how much they use up.

Fuel needed for a Jump depends on the size of the ship and the
length of the Jump and is calculated as 0.1 tonnage Jump distance.
A single Jump of that distance consumes that much fuel.

For example, a 200 ton ship with Jump–1 would require 0.1 200
1=20 tons of fuel for a Jump.

The amount of fuel required by the power plant depends on the
rating of the power plant. See the table at the bottom of this page.
The fuel amounts listed will power the ship for two weeks, which is
the bare minimum for a Jump-capable starship.

For more information on fuel, see page 140.

THE MAIN COMPARTMENT
The ship's main compartment contains all non-drive features of the
ship, including the bridge, ship's computer, the staterooms, the low
passage berths, the cargo hold and other items.

Bridge
All ships must have a bridge containing basic controls,
communications equipment, avionics, scanners, detectors, sensors,
and other equipment for proper operation of the ship. The size of
the bridge varies depending on the size of the ship:

Ship SizeShip Size Bridge SizeBridge Size
200 tons or less 10 tons
300 tons – 1000 tons 20 tons
1,100 – 2000 tons 40 tons
More than 2,000 tons 60 tons

The cost for this bridge is MCr. 0.5 per 100 tons of ship.

Computer
The basic controls do not include the ship's computer, which is
usually installed adjacent to the bridge. The computer is identified
by its model number; the computer table indicates details of price,
capacity, and tech level available. In general, larger computers are

just like personal computers (see page 91) but are considerably
more powerful because the software for ship operations requires
more processing power than normal programs (see Ship

Alternative Drives
Tr a d i t i o n a l l y, t h e o n l y f o r m o f f a s t e r - t h a n - l i g h t m o v e m e n t i n Tr a v e l l e r has been the classic Jump drive, which always takes one week to
travel a number of parsecs equal to its Jump rating and consumes a vast amount of fuel. If the Referee wishes to model other science
fiction settings with their own forms of stardrive, the classic Jump drive rules may not be entirely appropriate. The alternative drives
below use all the same rules as the Jump drive (mass, fuel, power consumption, range) unless otherwise stated.

Some of these drives consume much less fuel or allow much faster travel than the Jump drive, so introducing these drives will vastly
impact the carrying capacity of a starship, the profi tability of trade, the speed of communication and so forth.

Warp Drive: Warp Drive: The ship warps space around it, allowing it to move faster-than-light while staying in our universe. A warp drive does
not have a maximum range – instead, the ship's drive rating indicates the number of parsecs crossed per week of travel. Warp travel
consumes fuel at twice the normal rate for the ship's power plant rather than needing a single massive expenditure in the manner of a
Jump drive.

Te l e p o r t D r i v e : Te l e p o r t D r i v e : T h e s h i p i n s t a n t a n e o u s l y j u m p s f r o m o n e p o i n t t o a n o t h e r. T h i s w o r k s j u s t l i k e t h e s t a n d a r d J u m p d r i v e w i t h o u t t h e w e e k -
long wait in hyperspace. Instead, no time whatsoever elapses during the transition from one place to another. A teleport consumes no
extra fuel but jumping is a strain on the ship's systems and multiple successive jumps can damage the drive.

Hyperspace Drive: Hyperspace Drive: The portal drive functions by opening up a gateway into hyperspace, through which the ship can pass. When in
hyperspace, the ship uses its conventional engines to travel, then opens up a second gateway back to the normal universe, effectively
taking a short cut through a higher dimension. A hyperspace drive is limited by the size of the spacecraft that can pass through the portal

- see the Hyperspace Portal table. A hyperspace drive consumes no extra fuel, but takes up twice as much space as a jump drive. While
in hyperspace, the spacecraft moves at a rate of one parsec per day per maneuver drive rating.

Alternative Power Plants
Tr a v e l l e r posits the development of highly efficient fusion power plants, but other settings may use different sources of power. Unless
otherwise noted, these power plants use all the same rules as the standard fusion power plants.

Fission: Fission: A fi ssion plant requires radioactive elements as fuel. Fission drives only produce half as much power as a fusion drive of the
same type – when calculating required power plant rating, work out the required rating for a fusion drive and then find the rating for a
drive that produces twice as much power. For example, a 400 ton ship with maneuver and jump ratings of B requires a fusion plant
with rating B. Cross-referencing B and 400 tons on the Performance by Hull Volume table gives '1'. A fi ssion plant for that ship would
have to be rating D or higher, as that is the minimum rating to get performance level '2'.

Fission drive fuel costs 1,000,000 Cr. per ton. Power plants use the following table to determine how many tons of fuel they consume
with a year of operation:

Antimatter: Antimatter: Antimatter drives work by annihilating small amounts of hydrogen and anti-hydrogen. No tonnage needs to be allocated to
fuel, but the drive must be refuelled once per month, at a cost of 5,000 Cr. per ton of drive.

Escape PodEscape Pod
Abandoning a doomed ship is literally a leap into the darkness. If the ship was disabled close to an inhabitable planet, then the pod may be able to make it to safety.
Otherwise, the survivors will have to drift, hoping that a passing rescuer detects their distress beacon.
The escape pod...

1. ... is empty, a mute testament to the dangers of space travel. Its logs contain information about the ship it came from.
2. ... has crashed on an uninhabited and wild world. Any survivors will need rescuing.
3. ... contains a solitary survivor from the doomed ship – but she was the target of the original attack!
4. ... contains children, now orphaned.
5. ... was launched from a military vessel. The surviving offi cer will demand the characters aid him in completing his mission.
6. ... has landed on a primitive world, and altered their culture forever.

SPACECRAFT DESIGN SPACECRAFT DESIGN

Staterooms
Quarters for the crew and passengers are provided in the form of
staterooms containing sleeping and living facilities. Each stateroom
is suffi cient for one person, displaces 4 tons, and costs Cr. 500,000.
In some starships (especially exploratory vessels, military ships,
and privately-owned starships) staterooms can be double occupied.
No stateroom can contain more than two persons however, as it
would strain the ship's life support equipment. The tonnage and
cost of the staterooms includes the life support systems needed to
keep the crew alive.

Low Passage Berths
Facilities for carrying passengers in cold sleep may be installed in
a ship. One low passage berth carries one low passenger, costs Cr.
50,000, and displaces one-half ton. Low berths also serve well in
emergencies in that they can provide suspended animation facilities
for characters when medical care, rescue, or assistance is not
immediately available.

Emergency low berths are also available; they will not carry
passengers, but can be used for survival. Each costs Cr. 100,000 and
displaces one ton. Each holds four persons.

Cargo Hold
The design plan must indicate cargo capacity. There is no cost but
cargo carried may not exceed cargo capacity. Any space left over after
all systems have been installed may be allocated to cargo space.

Fuel Scoops
Fuel scoops allow an unstreamlined ship to gather unrefined fuel
from a gas giant. Streamlined ships have fuel scoops built in. Adding
scoops costs Cr. 1,000,000 and requires no tonnage.

Fuel Processors
Fuel processors convert unrefined fuel into refi ned fuel. One ton
of fuel processors can convert 20 tons of unrefined hydrogen into
refi ned fuel per day. A ton of fuel processing equipment costs Cr
50,000.

Luxuries
While the tonnage allocated to staterooms includes air refreshers,
passageways, mess halls, crew lounges and other living space, it
is often cramped and uncomfortable. Luxuries cost Cr. 100,000 per
ton, and make life on board ship more pleasant. Each ton of luxuries
counts as one level of the Steward skill for the purposes of carrying
passengers, and therefore allows a ship to carry middle and high
passage passengers without carrying a trained steward on board.

Ship's Locker
Every ship has a ship's locker. Typical equipment carried aboard will
include protective clothing, vacc suits, weapons such as shotguns
or pistols, ammunition, compasses and survival aids, and portable
shelters. The contents of the locker are defined only when they

need to be but always contains vacc suits and other useful items.
The ship's locker is usually protected by a biometric lock keyed
to the ship's offi cers.

Vehicles and Drones
A spacecraft can carry a number of smaller ships, vehicles and
drones. The tonnage and cost covers minimal hangar space,
indicating the vehicle is either carried on the outer hull or in a form-
fitting compartment on board. For ease of access and for storage
of spare parts and equipment, many ships will allocate more
space to some vehicles.

MinMining ing Drones: Drones: Mining drones allow a ship to mine asteroids.
Each set of mining drones takes up ten tons, and allows the ship
to process 1d6 10 tons of asteroid per working day. The tonnage
allocated includes ore handling machinery, allowing the ship to take
on ore and transfer it to the cargo bay.

ReRepair Dpair Drones: rones: Carrying repair drones allows a ship to make
battlefi eld repairs with the AutoRepair software or when managed
by a character with Mechanic or Engineer skills. Repair drones
have the same statistics as repair robots (page 95) only without an
Intellect program.

ProProbe Dronesbe Drones: : Probe drones are for surveying planetary surfaces.
Each ton of probe drones contains five drones. Probe drones can be
dropped from orbit in disposable entry shells but must be recovered
manually. Probe drones are also capable of surveying orbiting
satellites, derelicts and other space debris. They can also be used as
communications relays. See page 95 for probe drone statistics.

Escape Pscape Pods: ods: This covers the installation of rescue bubbles (see
page 97) and other escape pods for the entire crew.

Life Boaife Boat, Ship's Boat, Shuttle, Pinnace, Cutter: t, Ship's Boat, Shuttle, Pinnace, Cutter: These are all small
craft, hangared either in or on the ship's hull. Their statistics can be
found from page 132 onwards.

Air/Air/Raft, A Raft, ATV: TV: These are vehicles, also stored in or on the ship. Their
statistics can be found in the vehicles section of the Equipment
chapter, page 103.

Abusing The Ship's Locker
The purpose of the ship's locker is to provide useful mundane
equipment on demand so the players do not have to bother
keeping track of every single flak jacket and toolkit. It is not
an inexhaustible supply of free stuff, nor is it a magic box
that produces whatever the characters happen to need right
this second. Referees should sternly refuse any unreasonable
requests regarding the contents of the ship's locker – it is a tool
to simplify bookkeeping, nothing more.

SPACECRAFT DESIGN SSPACECRAFTPACECRAFT D DESIGNESIGN

ARMAMENTS
Weapons for spacecraft fall into two basic categories – turret
weapons and bay weapons. Turrets are small gun emplacements
on the outer hull of the ship capable of independently targeting
and tracking enemy ships. Bay weapons are larger systems built
into the spacecraft.

The number of turrets or bays that may be installed is limited by
the tonnage of the spacecraft. A ship has one hardpoint per 100
tons of ship and each weapon system takes up one hardpoint. A
weapon system may include multiple weapons – for example, a
triple turret contains three lasers, missile launchers, sandcasters or
some combination of three weapons.

Turrets
One turret may be attached to each hardpoint on the ship. If a turret
is installed, then one ton of space must be allocated to fire control
systems (included in the following table):

Pop-Up Pop-Up is a quality that can be applied to any type of turret – the
turret is concealed in a pod or recess on the hull, and is detectable
only when deployed. A ship with all its weapons in pop-up turrets
looks unarmed to a casual sensor scan.

Fixed Mounting Fixed Mounting weapons cannot move, are limited to fi ring in
one direction (normally straight ahead), and are found mainly on
fighters. A fi xed mounting costs half as much as a turret of the

same type, so a single fi xed mounting costs 0.1 MCr., a double
fixed mounting costs 0.25 MCr., and a triple fi xed mounting
costs 0.5 MCr.

Missile racks Missile racks are launchers for small anti-ship missiles. The damage
of a missile depends on the type of missile used. Missile racks need
ammunition – twelve missiles take up one ton of space.

Sandcasters Sandcasters are defensive weapons; they dispense small particles
which counteract the strength of lasers and protect the ship. A
sandcaster reduces the damage from a beam weapon by 1d6.
Sandcasters require ammunition. Twenty sandcaster barrels take up
one ton of space, and cost 10,000 credits.

Bays
Bay weapons are much larger than turrets, and take up 50 tons of
space and one hard point, as well as one ton of space for fire control.
They are found only on larger spacecraft.

Fusion guns Fusion guns fi re a directed beam of fusing hydrogen at targets.

Meson guns Meson guns project a stream of mesons at a target. Mesons have an
extremely short half-life, and are calculated to decay while within the
enemy ship. Meson weapons are therefore unaffected by armor,
as the blast only becomes harmful after it has already passed
through the hull. Meson guns also inflict an automatic radiation hit
on the crew of any target struck.

Crew Requirements
The number of crew on a ship varies depending on its level of automation and complexity. It is possible to run a ship with a very small
crew – a single scout can run a hundred-ton scout ship, running from position to position – but if disaster strikes, a lightly crewed ship
has a much slower response time than a fully crewed spacecraft. Independent traders and scouts tend to run with as small a crew as
possible. Corporate vessels have an average-size crew, while military ships are usually fully crewed to maximise their effectiveness in
battle.

Mercenary TicketMercenary Ticket
Many travellers are former military personnel, and so mercenary tickets are an obvious line of work for them. A small group of highly mobile and heavily armed characters can be
employed for a variety of purposes, some of them even legal. Mercenary tickets can pay tens of thousands of credits for a few days of action, but are often highly dangerous.
The ticket...

1. ... is training a band of revolutionaries on a troubled planet to use modern weapons. The revolutionaries are rebelling against the planet's corrupt and autocratic ruler,
    and intend to storm the palace as soon as they know how to defeat its defences.
2. ... involves recovering the cargo of a crashed ship from the middle of a swamp, fi lled with dangerous creatures, natural hazards and crazed territorial natives. Another
    criminal gang is also after the crashed cargo.
3. ... is part of a long-running war between two corporations over the resources of a rich world. The other corporation will offer them more cash to change sides.

### SSCOUTCOUT, , TTYPEYPE S S

Using a 100-ton hull, the scout ship is intended for exploration, survey, and courier duties, with many in service throughout known space.
The wedge-shaped scout is a common sight on the frontier. Many are in the hands of former members of the Scout Service. The Type S is
one of the most venerable designs in the Imperium, and is remarkably easy to maintain and repair.

### SSEEKEREEKER M MININGINING S SHIPHIP

A variation on the hundred-ton Scout hull, the Seeker removes half the staterooms and brings the fuel tank down to a more modest twenty-
four tons. The mining ship carries ten tons of mining drones, and its cargo capacity is increased to twenty-two tons. These small mining
ships scavenge the asteroid belts, looking for deposits of valuable minerals. Many Seekers mount a pulse laser in the turret for mining.

All the spacecraft designs in this section of the book are in common use throughout the Imperium, and can be constructed at any
standard shipyard. The cost listed for each vessel includes the 10% discount for being a standard design but does not include any fuel
or ammunition for the weapon systems (if they require it). Where designs come in 'under-tonned' this is usually because space has been
reserved for fi re control or ammunition in upgraded versions of the same ship.

'Heavy freighter' is something of a misnomer, as this thousand-ton
vessel is still tiny compared to the mammoth corporate vessels
that also ply the trade routes. Still, with a cargo capacity of 500
tons, the heavy freighter can serve the needs of a small colony. Its
confi guration is distributed, making landing impractical. The heavy
freighter can be docked at a HighPort (see page 178) or unloaded
using shuttles. It carries a single cargo shuttle. There are eight
staterooms for the crew; however, such vessels are perennially
understaffed. It has a pair of triple turrets for defence, equipped
with sandcasters and lasers, but the lack of crew makes the freighter
vulnerable to boarding actions.

### CCORSAIRORSAIR

The Corsair design was originally intended as a raider and pocket warship, but has
been adopted by criminal and terrorist gangs across known space. Ten staterooms
serve as quarters for the crew (pilot, navigator, three engineers and assorted thugs and
cutthroats numbering up to five more); twenty low berths are available for emergency use,
or to hold captives.

Notable features on the Corsair are large cargo doors and variable identification features.
The large clamshell doors can open to reveal the entire cargo bay; the ship can accept a
hundred-ton ship into its cargo bay. The ship has several centrally controlled identification
features which can alter the shape and configuration of the ship at a moment's notice – fi ns
retract and or extend, modules appear or disappear and radio emissions alter frequency
and content. The ship's transponders can be altered to identify the vessel as having any
of a variety of missions and identities. The Corsair is unarmored, relying on speed and
firepower instead of staying power.

the right people were in the right place at the right time. There
are always threats to interstellar commerce, ambitious dukes
putting their own interests ahead of the common good, and
rapacious or subversive alien forces plotting to conquer
known space. Characters may fi nd themselves unoffi cially
drafted by Imperial intelligence to do what must be done.

The Imperial duty is...

1. ... bringing a secret message to an Imperial agent in a
    starport. Enemies are hunting for the message, and the
    characters must conceal it.
2. ... scouting a neutral system for an enemy base – the
    Imperium believes it is there, but must work through
    private spies.
3. ... infi ltrating a smuggler's organization, so the
    Imperium can swoop in and smash the crime ring with
    inside information.
4. ... fi nding a way to test the loyalty of a planetary
    administrator, who is suspected of allying himself with
    an enemy.
5. ... transporting an Imperial commando team to a neutral
    world. The commandoes clash with the characters.
6. ... 'losing' a troublesome passenger.

PiracyPiracy
Raids on commercial shipping are distressingly common in
certain sectors. The high cost of keeping a ship flying forces
some captains to turn to piracy. The Imperial Navy hunts
down the most troublesome raiders, but others slip through
the net. The most common form of piracy involves spies
waiting at the starport, watching for suitable targets and
transmitting flight paths to pirate vessels lurking near the
hundred-diameter jump limit. Other pirates attack vessels in
transit to gas giants, outlying moons, or offworld colonies
and outposts.

The pirates...

1. ... demand the characters dump their cargo into space,
    or face immediate destruction.
2. ... intend to board and capture the characters' vessel.
3. ... are actually illegal privateers in the employ of a noble
    from a neighboring world, preying on shipping.
4. ... have no idea what they're doing, but are desperate
    enough to be dangerous.
5. ... have an agent on board the characters' ship, as a
    stowaway or passenger.
6. ... want something the characters are carrying – possibly
    something they don't even know is onboard.

These fast-moving system defence boats are used to patrol the space

spare internal space to mount a more powerful maneuver drive,
giving it six Gs of acceleration which is more than enough catch

for prisoners or marines. It has twenty tons of cargo space and carries
a life boat for rescue missions. A triple turret with a pair of missile
launchers and a pulse laser gives the cutter enough firepower to
deal with most foes.

### SSMALLMALL C CRAFTRAFT

The following ships are all classified as small craft because they displace less than 100 tons. The rules for designing small craft are slightly
different to the rules for designing larger spacecraft and will be presented in full in a forthcoming Tr a v e l l e r supplement. For now, we present
the most common small craft that travellers in the Third Imperium are likely to encounter.

LAUNCH
Also termed a life boat, this craft uses a 20-ton hull. It is a functional spacecraft but not suitable for extended journeys through space; its
most common use is to ferry people and cargo between ships or between ships and planetside. A launch's small power plant cannot power
a laser and so when adding weapons it is limited to missile racks and sandcasters. The craft has 13 tons of cargo space.

SHIP'S BOAT
Using a 30-ton hull, the ship's boat is capable of excellent acceleration and is a worthy upgrade to the more utilitarian launch. Due to its
excess cargo space it is often customised as a troop transport and staging point for boarding actions. Although the ship's boat uses a larger
power plant, so much power is dedicated to the maneuver drive that it can only mount a single beam or pulse laser. All other weapons
must be missile racks or sandcasters.

missions. They can mount up to two beam or pulse lasers before
overloading the power plant.

A shuttle is capable of moderate acceleration and can carry 71 tons of
cargo from ship to surface – the most any small craft is capable of. Most
starports have a fl eet of cargo shuttles for servicing orbiting trade vessels.
They may be retrofi tted with weapons but, like the pinnace, can draw only
enough power to feed two lasers.

MODULAR CUTTER
The fi fty-ton cutter is capable of good speed
within a short-range operational capacity and
has a crew of two. Its main feature is the 30
ton 'module bay' that allows the cutter to be
quickly and easily reconfigured for different
missions. Changing the module in a modular
cutter is an Easy (+4 DM), Intelligence-based
Engineer (any) or Mechanic check, with no
non-profi ciency penalty. It normally takes 1–6
minutes but is often drawn out to 1–6 hours
to ensure success.

The modular cutter can mount up to two
lasers but any more puts undue strain on the
power plant and causes it to shut down.

Three modules are commonly available for the cutter:

- The ATV module ATV module includes either a wheeled or a tracked ATV
and the means to deposit it on a planetary surface and pick it up
again later. The module can serve as an ATV storage location.
It costs MCr. 1.8.
- The fuel module fuel module incorporates a fuel scoop and 30 tons of fuel tank.
It is usually used to ferry fuel from point to point and costs MCr. 1.
- The open module open module is a customisable frame with 30 tons of excess space.
The only difference between an open module and a module-less cutter is that
without an installed module the cutter's module bay is open to space. An open module
provides a sealed environment for a mere 100,000 Credits and can be customised before installation (at additional cost)
    with staterooms, low berths, fuel tanks, weapons and ammunition, or anything else travellers could want.

LIGHT FIGHTER
The light fi ghter is a small, fast, highly manoeuvrable ship used for making high-speed attack runs on enemy ships. They consist mainly
of a power plant attached to a laser or other weapon with a pilot sitting on top. Fighters pose aggravating tactical complications for the
commander of a vessel under attack by them but are seldom enough to destroy a larger ship without support.

Some fi ghter patterns mount a triple fixed mounting with missile racks or sandcasters instead of a pulse laser and convert the cargo

sandcaster fi ghter costs 18,500,000 Credits without ammunition.

Old Ships
Many ships serve for decades or even centuries before being scrapped. Adventurers and free traders are often forced by necessity to
purchase outdated or damaged vessels instead of new or pristine ships. Characters purchasing an outdated ship gain 1d6 ship shares

(^2) If the ship's Structure is 0 or less, then it is not spaceworthy and will disintegrate within 1d6 minutes of leaving atmosphere. It can be flown within an atmosphere but
will come apart the moment it hits severe weather, gets hit by an attack, undergoes stressful maneuvers, or otherwise comes under strain.

than combat between spacecraft (for which refer to Space Combat,
page 146). This chapter covers the following topics: Airlocks, Airlocks,

and Maintenance, Encounters, Fuel, Jump Travel, Life Support, and Maintenance, Encounters, Fuel, Jump Travel, Life Support,
Passage, Repairs, Security, and Travel Times.Passage, Repairs, Security, and Travel Times.

AIRLOCKS
A ship has at least one airlock per 100 tons. The average airlock
is large enough for three people in vacc suits to pass through at
the same time. An airlock takes ten seconds to cycle. Under normal
circumstances, airlocks are locked down from the bridge and require
a Very Diffi cult (–4) Engineer (electronics) check to override. An
unlocked airlock can be triggered from outside. Airlocks generally
have vacc suits (see page 87), rescue bubbles (see page 97) and
cutlasses (see page 98) in a ship's locker nearby.

Ships with cargo space have cargo hatches, allowing up to 10% of
their cargo to be transferred at any time. Some ships, such as the
Corsair (see page 129) have specially designed cargo hatches that
open onto the entire cargo bay but these are the exception rather
than the rule.

ATMOSPHERIC OPERATIONS
A streamlined ship is designed to enter a planetary atmosphere,
and can function like a conventional aircraft. Pilot or Flyer (winged)
checks are required in high winds and other extreme weather.

A standard-confi guration ship can also enter a planet's atmosphere,
but is reliant on its thrusters to keep it aloft at all times and is
extremely ungainly. Pilot checks are required for all movement and
suffer a –2 DM.

A distributed ship must make a Pilot check at a –4 DM when it
enters an atmosphere and for every minute of fl ight. Each check that
is failed inflicts 2d6 points of damage.

BOARDING, DOCKING AND LANDING
Landing: Landing: Any ship with a standard or streamlined hull may land on
the surface. Unstreamlined ships suffer a –2 DM to any Pilot checks
made in atmosphere while a ship with a Distributed hull suffers a
–4 DM to any Pilot checks, and is likely to take severe structural
damage if it lands. Landing at a starport is a Routine (+2) task for
most ships taking 10–60 seconds (so most pilots will take extra time
and get a +1 or +2 DM on top of this – see page 50).

Most ships have landing gear, allowing them to touch down 'in
the wild', which requires an Average (+0), Diffi cult (–2) or even

Very Diffi cult (–4) check, depending on local conditions. Non-
distributed ships can also land on bodies of water without sinking.
Failing a landing roll means that the ship has landed improperly
or even crashed.

Docking: Docking: Two spacecraft may dock if they are close together and
neither ship attempts to resist the docking maneuver. Many airlock
designs across charted space are compatible; for incompatible
airlocks, ships extend fl exible plastic docking tubes that adapt to the
target airlock. Docking with another vessel is a Routine (+2) Pilot
task taking 1–6 minutes. If one ship is drifting or unpowered, the
diffi culty rises to Diffi cult (–2).

Boarding: Boarding: Hostile boarding actions are safest when the enemy
ship is crippled, in which case it is a standard docking procedure.
If the enemy ship is still moving, then the prospective boarders
must match the target's velocity and dock with it (a Diffi cult (–2)
Pilot task), or else just land on the hull and either make their way
to an airlock or cut through from outside. Most boarders wishing
to capture a ship intact will head to an airlock and cut or force
their way through there, minimising hull damage. Boarding parties
customarily use cutlasses or accelerator weapons.

then these debts must be paid each month. The standard terms for
a ship mortgage is paying 1/240th of the cash price each month for
480 months (40 years). In effect, interest and bank financing cost
a simple 120% of the fi nal cost of the ship, and the total fi nanced
price equals 220% of the cash purchase price.

SPACECRAFT OPERATIONS SPACECRAFT OPERATIONS

Ship shares are treated as reducing the cash price of the ship, and
so reduce the monthly cash payments.

Life Support and Supplies: Life Support and Supplies: Each stateroom on a ship costs Cr. 2,000
per month, occupied or not. This cost covers supplies for the life
support system as well as food and water, although meals at this
level will be rather spartan. Each low passage berth costs Cr. 100
per month.

Fuel: Fuel: Fuel costs Cr. 500/ton for refi ned fuel, or Cr. 100/ton for
unrefi ned fuel. Fuel requirements for Jumping and maintaining
power are covered on page 107.

Repairs and Repairs and Maintenance: Maintenance: A ship needs maintenance, which costs
0.1% (1/1000th) of the total cost of the ship per year and requires
a shipyard. Maintenance should be carried out each month. If
maintenance is skipped or skimped on, roll 2d6 each month, with
a +DM equal to the number of months skipped. On an 8+, the ship
takes damage to a random system. Roll on the system degradation
table for the number of hits.

Crew Salaries: Crew Salaries: Hired crew members must be paid each month.

Berthing Costs: Berthing Costs: Landing at a starport incurs a cost, which varies

Mortgages Made Easy
Although talk of Tr a v e l l e r ' s ship mortgages can seem complex it follows a very simple procedure:

1. Work out the cash price of the ship (including any 10% discount for a standard design, not including any fuel or ammunition).
2. Count up the ship shares that characters can put towards the ship. Reduce the cash price by 1% for every ship share contributed.
3. Divide the reduced price by 240. This is the montly payment.
4. Pay this payment every month for 40 years.

Skipping Out On Debts
Ship captains hoping to avoid crippling repayments on multi-
million credit loans may be tempted to skip out on repayments,
Jumping to distant systems to make a new life for themselves. If
the characters do so, they may be chased by ship tracers (bounty
hunters) employed by the bank, or logged as criminals in the
Imperial database and hunted down by naval vessels. For each
new system, roll 2d6 and apply the modifi ers below. If the result
is an 8 or more the characters will be hunted for their crimes
while in the system. A natural 12 means the characters have
been found regardless of modifi ers.

ENCOUNTERS
Space is unimaginably vast – on a galactic scale, stars are little
wisps of hydrogen and gas giants are just specks of matter. If ships
travelled through the whole of the space in a system, they would
never encounter each other. However, spacecraft crowd to a few
places in any system, such as the hundred-diameter Jump limit
of colonized worlds, to the industrial belts in orbit, and to the gas
giants and settled moons. Outside these regions, the chance of an
encounter is negligible.

For a random encounter, roll 1d6 every week, day or hour, depending
on how busy local space is. On a 6, the ship has encountered
something – roll d66 on the table below, applying DMs to the tens
dice only. (Thus, Settled Space has a range of 21–76, and Wild Space
has a range of 01–56.)

Encounters in bold bold cannot be ignored – they are potentially hostile
ships or encounters that will force the characters to respond.

The encounter distance depends on the results of a Sensors check
(modifi ed by the other vessel's attempts at Stealth, if any). Civilian
vessels and military craft not on maneuvers broadcast an IFF

Collisions, signals and solar fl ares are obviously exempt from
encounter distance rules.

Collision!: Collision!: Almost any collision at high speed will destroy even the
most powerful spacecraft. In this case, the ship has collided with a
tiny object that has nevertheless smashed into the hull with great
force. The ship suffers 2d6 damage (see page 150 for the effects of
damage). If a pilot was on duty at that time, he may make a Pilot
check to avoid disaster.

Distress Signals: Distress Signals: Ships in the Imperium transmit the standard
timestamped SOS message (also known as Mayday in Solomani or
Signal GK in Vilani) when in distress. Any vessel which detects an
SOS is legally required to respond and offer assistance or contact
the authorities. Failure to render assistance is a criminal offence
but the harsh requirements of life support and orbital mechanics
mean that many deaths in space are slow ones, where a crew know
they are doomed but have days or weeks in which to contemplate it.
Most ships carry emergency low berths where the crew can freeze
themselves and wait for rescue.

Some distress calls are fakes, intended to draw ships in so they can
be attacked.

Mining: Mining: A ship carrying mining drones can mine an asteroid for
useful ores. Roll 2d6 on the Asteroid Mining table to determine how
many tons of ore are available.

ResultResult Ore Available (see pages 165–166 for Ore Available (see pages 165–166 for

9–11 2d6 20 tons of uncommon ore
12 1d6 tons of radioactives

Police Vessel: Police Vessel: This result may also indicate a military vessel or
government ship. A police vessel will aid the characters if they are
attacked, but will also challenge them to identify themselves and will
scan them for contraband cargo.

Pirate: Pirate: Pirates operate in three ways, all aimed at avoiding contact
with the authorities at a spaceport (except in lawless systems

where pirates operate with impunity). Some ambush ships that
are travelling through normal space to outlying moons and colony
worlds. Others lurk around the hundred-diameter mark, hoping
to surprise a ship as it prepares to Jump. The pirates then quickly
loot the most valuable cargo and supplies and Jump themselves
before the authorities arrive. The third category of pirates have
agents and spies in the starport, and know exactly which ships
are suitable targets.

Pirates use Corsair-class vessels for preference, but many are in
armed Free Traders or even armed Scouts.

Salvage: Salvage: A derelict vessel or jettisoned cargo can be salvaged.
Salvaging requires at least one person to leave the salvaging ship

FUEL
Most ships use refi ned hydrogen as a fuel for their fusion engines
and Jump drives. Starports (see page 178) and virtually any other
facility that regularly hosts spacecraft will offer refuelling facilities.
Hydrogen is obtained from water or from the atmospheres of gas
giants, and refi ned fuel costs Cr. 500 per ton.

Some out-of-the-way places only offer unrefined fuel for only Cr. 100
per ton. Using unrefi ned fuel is dangerous when Jumping.

SPACECRAFT OPERATIONS SSPACECRAFTPACECRAFT O OPERATIONSPERATIONS

A ship with fuel scoops may gather fuel from bodies of water using
hoses. It may also scoop hydrogen from a gas giant. Scooping takes
1–6 hours and requires a successful Pilot skill check. Fuel gathered 'in
the wild' is unrefined, but a ship with fuel processors may refine it.

JUMP TRAVEL
Jump travel is the only known means by which a vessel may travel
faster than the speed of light. To Jump, a ship creates a bubble of
hyperspace by means of injecting high-energy exotic particles into
an artifi cial singularity. The singularity is driven out of our universe,
creating a tiny parallel universe which is then blown up like a balloon
by injecting hydrogen into it. The Jump bubble is folded around the
ship, carrying it into the little pocket universe.

This new universe is short-lived, and will eventually collapse,
precipitating the ship back into normal space several light-years
from its original position.

A ship can only safely Jump when it is more than one hundred
diameters distant from any object. A vessel could only Jump away
from Earth when it is more than 1.27 million kilometers distant (as
well as 140 million kilometers away from Sol and 300,000 kilometers
away from the Moon). Gravity can cause a Jump bubble to collapse
prematurely, bringing a ship back into normal space early (so if a
ship tried to Jump from Earth to Mars when the Sun was between
the two, the vessel would fall out of Jump space as soon as it came
within one hundred diameters of the Sun.

Preparing for Jump
To J u m p , t h e f o l l o w i n g p r o c e d u r e s m u s t b e f o l l o w e d :

- Astrogation: Astrogation: The Jump needs to be plotted. This is an Easy
    (+4) Education-based Astrogation check taking 10–60 minutes,
    modifi ed by the Jump distance (thus, a Jump–4 gives a –4 DM
    to the check). If the check is failed, then the astrogator must plot
    the Jump again. A Jump cannot be made until the astrogation
    calculations are complete. Astrogation can be done in advance
    (a Jump is normally plotted while the ship is travelling out to
    the hundred-diameter distance).
- Divert Power: Divert Power: A Jump drive requires a tremendous amount of
    power to function which must be supplied by the ship's power
    plant. On many vessels, especially older ships, the power plant
    strains to provide this much, leading to the tradition of 'Jump
    dimming' where non-essential systems including lighting are shut
    down to allow for Jump. If insufficient power is available the Jump
    drive cannot be activated. Firing the Jump drive is an Average
    (+0) Education-based Engineer (Jump drive) check taking 10–60
    seconds. The Effect of this check aids the Jump roll.
- Jump!: Jump!: Roll 2d6 and add the following DMs. If the result is 0
    or less, the ship misjumps (see below). If the result is 8+ the
    Jump is accurate. Any other result is an inaccurate Jump (which
    is only a minor setback).
- + the Effect of the divert power Engineer check
- –2 per Jump drive hit
  - –2 for using Unrefi ned fuel
  - –8 if still within the hundred-diameter limit

Jump Travel
A Jump carries the vessel a number of parsecs equal to the Jump
number. Jumps of less than one parsec (less than three light years,
or one hex) are possible, and count as Jump–1 for the purposes
of astrogation and fuel expenditure. Regardless of how far the
ship Jumps, it always stays in Jump Space for roughly one week
(148+6d6 hours).

While in Jump space, the ship is completely and utterly cut off from
the universe. It hangs in a shimmering bubble of boiling hydrogen,
a pocket dimension from which nothing can escape. It cannot
communicate with the normal universe, not even by psionic means.
It is utterly alone.

When the ship exits Jump space after an accurate Jump, it tends
to arrive close to the target world, but outside or on the verge of
the hundred-diameter limit. Inaccurate Jumps just dump the ship
somewhere in the inner system, requiring a long space flight.

Misjumps
On rare occasions, normally because of a lack of maintenance or
using unrefi ned fuel, a ship can misjump. Some misjumps are lethal,
causing the Jump bubble to collapse early or for time in the bubble
to fl ow differently, so that trillions of subjective years pass inside the
bubble and all that comes out the other end is hard radiation caused
by protons exceeding their half-life. A merciful Referee, though, may
wish to subject his players to the most survivable form of misjump,
where the ship ends up 1d6 1d6 parsecs in a random direction.

LIFE SUPPORT
Radiation
Radiation is a constant danger in space. Modern hull materials
shield against most radiation; coupled with the added protection
offered by hydrogen fuel tanks lining the inner hull this means that
the exposure suffered by most spacers is only a few times that of a
planetlubber. Characters in vessels flying too close to a star or with
breached hulls or damaged reactors do risk exposure.

Radiation exposure is measured in rads. Once a character has
absorbed a certain number of rads, he will suffer certain effects. One
problem with radiation exposure is that while physical symptoms
can be treated and may heal, the radiation never goes away. The
character's rads must be tracked. Further exposure adds to what the
character is already carrying around until a deadly level is reached.
Accumulated rads can be removed using anti-rad drugs.

Effects are suffered each time a character is exposed to radiation.
Thus a character who has absorbed 75 rads and recovered from
the effects, who absorbs another 20 from a solar flare, now has an
exposure of 95 rads whether he suffers any serious effects this time
or not. He is fast approaching a moderate dose.

Radiation Exposure
Characters exposed to a radiation weapon will receive a one-time
dose of radiation. Entering a radioactive area or being exposed to a

SPACECRAFT OPERATIONS SPACECRAFT OPERATIONS

leak or solar flare will cause exposure each round or hour.

Solar flares are still dangerous even to an armored starship, so
when a serious flare is detected space vessels try to hide behind
asteroids, moons etc. Orbital stations in systems with a lot of flare
activity have layers of radiation-absorbent materials and personnel
sanctuaries with even more protection, and can ride out even the
worst fl ares. Such protection is too bulky for most starships although
the orbital station itself might provide useful cover.

Suffocation
A spacecraft with power can sustain life support for one person per
stateroom for one month comfortably, and for six months at a stretch
(number of staterooms 5,000 person/hours). Without power, this
drops to two weeks at most. Other shelters list the amount of air
and life support available. The atmosphere can be 'freshened' by a
visit to a world with a breathable atmosphere.

Without life support, a character begins to suffocate, suffering 1d6
damage each minute. A character who is utterly without air (such as
one who is being smothered or strangled, or who has been dumped
out an airlock) suffers 1d6 damage each round instead.

PASSAGE
Passenger travel within the Imperium has been standardised into
four overarching categories – high, middle, working and low. In all
cases, passage is paid per Jump, and it is assumed that the ship will
take between one and three weeks to deliver the passenger to its
destination (allowing enough time to fly out, Jump for a week, then
travel to the destination world).

High PassaHigh Passage: ge: The passenger receives the best possible treatment.
The passenger receives a stateroom and one ton of cargo space for
baggage, and can expect high-quality entertainment. Each level of
Steward skill (including level 0) allows the steward to effectively look
after two high passage passengers on board a ship (so a character
with Steward 2 could care for six passengers).

Middle Middle Passage: Passage: Middle passage is generally sold on a stand-by
basis (so middle passengers can be 'bumped' by high passengers
who arrive later – a ship will only take middle passengers if it cannot
fill its staterooms with high passage clients). Each level of the
Steward skill (including level 0) allows the steward to care for fi ve
middle passengers. A baggage allowance of 100 kg is permitted.

WorkinWorking Passage: g Passage: This is identical to middle passage but the
passenger pays his way by serving on board ship in some capacity.

Low PasLow Passage: sage: A low passenger is frozen in a cryoberth and carried
as cargo. There is some danger to the passenger – a Medic check
is required upon opening the capsule, applying the passenger's
Endurance DM to the check. If failed, the passenger does not survive.
Low passage costs includes a 10 kg baggage allowance; many
commercial cryoberth units have a built-in baggage compartment.
It is customary for the ship's captain to contribute 10 credits from
every low passage towards a lottery in which each low passenger
randomly guesses how many will survive the trip. If the winner
is among the dead, the captain collects the prize. This lottery is
administered by the ship's steward.

The price of passage varies depending on how far you want to go:

Parsecs TravelledParsecs Travelled High High MiddleMiddle LowLow
1 Cr. 6,000 Cr. 3,000 Cr. 1,000
2 Cr. 12,000 Cr. 6,000 Cr. 1,200
3 Cr. 20,000 Cr. 10,000 Cr. 1,400
4 Cr. 30,000 Cr. 15,000 Cr. 1,600
5 Cr. 40,000 Cr. 20,000 Cr. 1,800
6 Cr. 50,000 Cr. 25,000 Cr. 2,000

Of course, passengers who are working their passage do not need
to pay but may fi nd themselves doing all the unpleasant jobs that
no one else wants to do.

REPAIRS
Damage to a ship falls into three categories – Hull Damage,
Structure Damage and System Damage.

A destroyed system costs 2d6 10% of its original cost to
repair, and cannot be repaired using spare parts – it can only be
repaired at a world with the appropriate Technology Level or a
well-equipped starport.

Hull Damage: Hull Damage: Hull damage can be repaired with a Mechanic check
taking 1–6 hours, and consumes one ton of spare parts.

Structure Damage: Structure Damage: Structure damage can only be repaired at a
shipyard, and requires 1–6 weeks per point of damage. It costs
500,000 Credits per point.

System Damage: System Damage: A damaged system can be jury-rigged back to
functioning, but it will stop functioning again after 1d6 hours.
Repairing a damaged system requires not only an Average skill
check (Mechanic, Engineer (appropriate speciality) or Science
(appropriate speciality)) taking 1–6 hours but also spare parts. The
Effect of the check determines how many spare parts are required.
Spare parts can be purchased at the cost of Cr. 10,000 per ton.

SENSORS
The kind of sensors a ship has are dependent on the sensor package
installed (see page 108). Compare the range that something is to
the sensing ship with the sensors being used and look up the result
on the Detail By Sensors table (overleaf ).

Visual Visual sensors are electronically-enhanced telescopes.
Thermal Thermal sensors pick up heat emissions.
EM EM sensors detect power flows and transmissions.
Radar/Lidar Radar/Lidar detects physical objects. It can be active or passive. If a
ship is using active sensors, it is easier to detect (+2 DM to Sensors
checks) but detects more about its surroundings.
NAS NAS detects neural activity and intelligence.
Densitometers Densitometers can determine the internal structure and makeup of
an object.

SPACECRAFT SECURITY
Hijacking is one of the biggest threats faced by independent traders,
especially those that carry passengers or travel to dangerous space.
As the characters will likely face this threat (or be this threat) it is
worth looking at this in detail.

Cameras and Sensors
Most vessels have security cameras in public areas, such as the
galley, cargo bay and lounge, but not in private staterooms (but
these can be added at negligible additional cost). Cameras can be
viewed from any terminal by an authorized person. Internal sensors
on a ship are limited to environmental detectors like smoke alarms,
and most ships are not calibrated to, say, detect heat traces or life
signs within the hull. It is possible to detect when a door is opened
or closed, although these sensors can easily be disabled.

Computers
The diffi culty to hack into a ship's computer depends on the rating
of the Security software running on it (see page 92). Few ships have

+++TAS Bulletin: The annual Festival of the Shorn takes place on Vincennes in one month's time. Interested parties are advised to book accommodation promptly, as this

SSPACECRAFTPACECRAFT O OPERATIONSPERATIONS SPACECRAFT OPERATIONS

anything less than Very Diffi cult (–4) Security, but often the security
system will apply only to external connections, and a hacker inside
the ship will only face Average (+0) Security software.

Gaining access to the ship's records is an Average (+0) task.
Convincing the computer that you are a member of the crew is
Diffi cult (–2). Overriding security systems is Very Diffi cult (–4), and
gaining control of key systems like navigation or power is Formidable
(–6). All these are cumulative with the Security software DM – trying
to hack into the power core of a warship is going to incur a –12
(doubly Formidable) modifi er at least. The use of task chains (see
page 51) can offset this diffi culty somewhat – once you have stolen
the identity of a crewmember you have greater access to security,
and once you have beaten security you can access key systems more
easily, and so on.

Locks
Doors, airlocks, lockers and other secure panels are locked. In
general, external locks are tougher than internal ones (increasing
the diffi culty by +2). Locks can be:
Mechanical: Mechanical: Requiring a key or combination. These can be opened
with an Average (+0) Mechanic check or by stealing a key or learning
the combination.
Electronic: Electronic: Requiring a keycard or combination. These can be opened
with a Diffi cult (–2) Engineer (electronics) check or by stealing a key
or learning the combination.

Biometric: Biometric: Requiring a voiceprint, DNA test, palm print or retina scan.
These can be opened with a Very Difficult (–4) Engineer (electronics)
check or by stealing a sample from an authorized person.
Intelligent: Intelligent: Intelligent locks recognize authorized crew. These can be
opened with a Very Diffi cult (–4) Engineer (electronics) check or by
hacking the computer.

Any non-mechanical lock can be opened or closed remotely if the
crew wishes to allow this option (but then the doors can also be
hacked remotely). Internal doors on a ship are airtight.

Security Systems
Alarms: Alarms: If an alarm is tripped (hull breach, fi re, door being forced
open, alarm button pressed) it will alert the crew. The location of the
alarm will be shown on computer displays. The average passenger
ship has several crew trained in combat; military ships will carry
marines. Some vessels will even have security robots who respond
automatically to alarms.
Gravity: Gravity: It is possible to alter the artifi cial gravity on board. Reducing
gravity to zero will limit actions to the level of a character's Zero-G
skill. Gravity can also safely be increased up to 3G.

Venting Atmosphere: Venting Atmosphere: If a compartment is connected to an airlock,
then the air can be vented from that area. Characters in that area
must make a Strength check to hang on and will also begin to

TRAVEL TIMES
Interplanetary Travel: Interplanetary Travel: Worlds orbiting the same star are accessible
by interplanetary travel, on ships operated by local entrepreneurs, or
with a variety of small craft. Interplanetary travel takes long periods
of time; since most stellar systems have only one major world,
interplanetary travel is infrequent.

Commercial starships usually make two Jumps per month. They
spend one week in Jump, followed by one week in the star system,
travelling from the Jump point to the local world, refuelling, marketing
cargo, fi nding passengers, leaving the starport and proceeding to a
Jump point again. The week in the system usually provides some
time for crew recreation and wandering around the planet.

Non-commercial ships usually follow the same schedule of one
week in Jump and one week in a system. If haste is called for, a ship
may refuel at a gas giant immediately and re-Jump right away. This
allows the ship to make one Jump per week but makes no provision
for cargo, passengers, or local stops.

CoCorporate Intriguerporate Intrigue
On many worlds, the corporations and the nobility are inextricably entwined – lords and dukes sit on the boards of the megacorporations, while corporate money buys the
prestige of a noble title. On other planets, the nobility are a bulwark against commercial greed. Imperial society is delicately balanced between these two great estates, and
when this balance is disturbed, it is a time of danger and opportunity.

The corporation...

1. ... is a bio-weapons researcher, and is experimenting on the local population, and hires the characters to help cover up its crimes.
2. ... is trying to replace the local planetary governor with a more malleable administrator.

SPACE COMBAT

### SSPACEPACE C COMBATOMBAT

Clashes between spacecraft in Tr a v e l l e r take place over distances
of thousands of kilometers and over long hours. While a warship
may sometimes fi nd itself desperately fi ring point-defence guns at
a swarm of fi ghters buzzing around its hull many battles are slow,
calculated affairs, with spears of brilliant light lancing out into the
darkness aimed at where the enemy is predicted to be.

Overview
Each turn in space combat lasts six minutes. Ship combat functions
similarly to personal combat, with each character taking up a
particular position on board such as pilot, gunner or engineer.
In each turn, the characters will have the opportunity to perform
several actions or move between positions.

Crew Positions
At the start of an engagement, all crew must be assigned to a
position on board ship. There can be only one pilot, but other than
that, any number of people can occupy the same position. It is
generally a good idea to cover as many as possible. Characters can
change positions during combat but it is important to know where
they start.

- Pilot: Pilot: Flies the ship, responsible for changing course and for
    evasive maneuvers.
- Captain: Captain: Commands the ship, and can use Leadership and
    Ta c t i c s s k i l l s.

The ship's computer can cover several positions if it is running the
appropriate software:

- Fire Control programs can either act gunners or aid existing
    gunners.
- A ship equipped with repair drones and Auto-Repair software
    acts as damage control.
- A ship running an Intellect program and Expert Pilot can be the
    pilot.
- A ship equipped with repair drones and running an Intellect
    program and Expert Engineer (M-drive or J-drive) can be a drive
    engineer.

Initiative
Each ship in an engagement rolls 2d6 to determine their starting
Initiative score. The ship with a greater Thrust score gains a +1 DM
to its roll.

The commander of each spacecraft (or each fleet, if more than one
ship is involved on each side) may a Tactics (naval) check. The Effect
is added to the Initiative of the spacecraft (or fleet).

MANEUVER PHASE
In each maneuver phase, a ship can allocate Thrust either
to movement (closing or increasing the range to a target) or
manoeuvring. The amount of thrust needed to close or open by one
range category is given in the Range Table – the number given is the
amount of thrust needed to move from that range category to either
a closer or more distant one. A ship can spend thrust over multiple
rounds to close or open a range category.

The Beowulf is 10,000 Kilometers away from a planet (Medium
range). It will cost the Beowulf five thrust to close from Medium to
Short range. Once at Short range, it will take another two thrust to
close to Close range or to back out to Medium range again.

If two ships are travelling towards each other, then add together the
Thrust allocated by both ships to movement to see how close they
are to changing range categories; if one ship is trying to escape from
the other then subtract the lower Thrust from the higher value to
work out the effective change in position – the faster ship will either
gain slightly or pull away slightly.

Any thrust not allocated to movement is allocated to manoeuvring,
which is done in the combat phase. Manoeuvring does not change
the range to the target but allows the ship to position itself better for
an attack or to avoid incoming fi re.

COMBAT PHASE
In each combat phase, a ship may maneuver, fire any of its
weapons, or board enemy vessels.

Maneuver
A ship can maneuver, dodging and weaving to evade enemy fire
or to position itself for a better attack. A ship may make a number

of maneuver actions per combat phase equal to the amount of
Thrust allocated to manoeuvring.

A maneuver action can be used to:

- Dock with another vessel: Dock with another vessel: The pilot must make a successful
    Pilot check. If the other ship does not wish to be docked with
    then make opposed Pilot checks; the ship trying to dock suffers
    a –2 DM. When docked, boarding actions can take place.
- Help line up a shot: Help line up a shot: A pilot may attempt to aid his gunners
    by providing a stable fi ring platform along an optimum attack
    vector. The pilot makes a Pilot check to aid his gunners as per
    the normal rules on task chains (see page 51).
- Dodge incoming fi re: Dodge incoming fi re: Any leftover Thrust can be spent as a
    reaction to dodge incoming fi re. See page 149.

Firing Beam Weapons
To fi r e a b e a m w e a p o n , t h e g u n n e r m u s t m a k e a s u c c e s s f u l G u n n e r
(turret) or Gunner (capital weapons) check, modifi ed by the range
to the target (see page 148). When targeted by a beam weapon, the
enemy ship may react by dodging, firing sand or triggering screens
(see Reactions). A gunner may fi re any or all of the weapons in his
turret or bay but each turret or bay may only fi re once per round.

If the attack is successful it will inflict damage. See Damage on
page 150. Damage is resolved after all attacks have been made
in a round.

Launching Missiles
Unlike beam weapons, which travel at the speed of light and so
hit the enemy vessel almost instantly, missile weapons take time
to cross the gulf of space. Missiles travel at Thrust 5 towards
their designated target and their position can either be tracked
as additional craft in the battle or, for the sake of simplicity, they
can be assumed to strike after a number of turns dependent
on launch range:

RangeRange

Tu r n s t o Tu r n s t o
ImpactImpact
Adjacent -
Close -
Short 1
Medium 1
Long 2
Very Long 5
Distant 10

Missiles cannot be used at Adjacent or Close range.

The gunner must make a Gunner (turret) or Gunner (capital
weapons) check to determine how accurate the missile launch
was. The effect of the Gunner check determines the chance that the
missile will strike its target when it hits.

Surprise
Stealth is virtually impossible in space – a spacecraft shows up
as a hot spot against the cold, so unless it is hiding behind an
asteroid or other object, it is easy to detect. The only way to
attack from surprise is to appear as a harmless ship until you
open fi re, or to jump in and attack without warning. If a ship has
surprise, then its opponents do not act in the Combat Phase of
the fi rst round.

A target may react to incoming missiles by dodging or point
defence. This reaction does not take place until the turn the missiles
arrive at their destination, so any manoeuvring or shooting must
wait until then.

SMART MISSILES
Advanced smart missiles are able to correct their course in flight
and even turn around and re-acquire targets they have missed. The
missile to-hit roll for smart missiles is always 8+ and if they miss
they make another attack every turn until they are destroyed with
point defence, jammed with ECM or otherwise dissuaded.

Boarding Actions
If two ships are Adjacent or docked, then a boarding action can be
attempted. If the ships are docked, then the attackers may cross
over safely via airlocks. If the ships are merely adjacent, then the
attackers must use thruster packs or small craft to cross over. While
crossing, the attackers may be attacked with point defence weapons
or by fi ring sand (see Reactions).

Once across, boarding actions can be resolved using the personal
combat rules or the quick boarding rules (see opposite).

Special Attacks
Several types of weapons have their own rules.

- Meson Guns: Meson Guns: Meson guns ignore armor and always roll on the
    Internal Damage table. Furthermore, they also automatically
    inflict a radiation crew hit in addition to any other damage.
- Fusion Guns: Fusion Guns: Fusion guns infl ict a radiation crew hit in addition
    to any other damage. The bonus radiation hit suffers a –DM
    equal to the ship's armor.
- Particle Beams: Particle Beams: Particle beams inflict a radiation crew hit in
    addition to any other damage. The bonus radiation hit suffers a
    –DM equal to the ship's armor.
- Nuclear Missiles: Nuclear Missiles: Nuclear missile hits inflict a radiation crew
    hit in addition to their normal damage. The bonus radiation hit
    suffers a –DM equal to the ship's armor.
- Sandcasters: Sandcasters: While the primary purpose of a sandcaster is to
    block incoming beam attacks, they can also be used as an attack.
    A sandcaster has a range of Close and inflicts 1 damage.

REACTIONS
A ship may react to incoming attacks. The following situations allow
reactions:

- Ta r g e t e d b y a b e a m a t t a c kTa r g e t e d b y a b e a m a t t a c k
- Incoming missileIncoming missile
- Attempted boardingAttempted boarding

The ship's Initiative determines how many times it may react in a
round.

InitiativeInitiative ReactionsReactions

Dodge
Each dodge reaction counts as a maneuver and so is limited by
the amount of Thrust allocated to maneuvers. One point of Thrust
allows a single dodge. To dodge, the pilot must make a Pilot check.
If successful, the attack suffers a –2 DM.

Point Defence
Tu r r e t l a s e r s c a n b e u s e d t o d e s t r o y i n c o m i n g m i s s i l e s. T h e m i s s i l e s
can only be destroyed in the moments before they strike the
spacecraft as they are too small and fast-moving to effectively target
at greater ranges. The gunner must make a Gunner (turrets) check
against the missile. If successful, the missile is destroyed. A gunner
may keep making Gunner checks against missiles until he misses
an attack; each attack suffers a cumulative –1 penalty. Attacks may
be directed against different incoming missiles.

Point defence can also be used to destroy incoming boarders in the
same way.

Fire Sand
Tu r r e t s e q u i p p e d w i t h s a n d c a s t e r s c a n fi r e s a n d a t i n c o m i n g b e a m
attacks. Each reaction spent on firing sand allows the gunner to
make a Gunner (turrets) roll. If successful the damage of each
beam in the incoming attack is reduced by 1d6. Resolve each beam
separately. Each fi ring of sand costs one canister of sand.

Sand can also be directed against incoming boarding parties using
thruster packs. If the sand attack is successful, each target in the
boarding party takes 8d6 damage.

Burning Initiative
A ship may reduce its Initiative score to get bonus reactions.
Each bonus reaction costs two Initiative and affects the ship's
Initiative score for the following round only.

System Defence BoatSystem Defence Boat
A non-starship specifi cally intended for defensive operations inside a star system. Developed on the principle that a non-starship (because of the increased armament
made possible by its lack of jump drives) can normally defeat a starship of equal tonnage. SDBs are typically stationed at the vital points of a system (the gas giants, the
asteroid belt, the major world, and so on) and attack invading vessels according to one or more predetermined plans. System Defence Boats range in size from 100 to
5000 tons and are constructed at all tech levels from 8 to 15. There are hundreds of different types, depending upon the specific mission for which they are designed.
Because SDBs have no jump drives, shifting them from system to system can be a problem. Some types have jump shuttles which fi t to the craft and provide jump
capability. Another method is simple transport in large bulk cargo containers; The SDBs are loaded into 10,000-ton or 20,000-ton bulk carriers for the multi-parsec journey.
This method, of course, is not recommended if immediate combat is expected at the destination.

SSPACEPACE C COMBATOMBAT SPACE COMBAT

Trigger Screens
Screens can be activated as long as the commander or one of the
gunners has the Gunner (screens) skill at Level 0 and the ship has
the required screen type (nuclear against nuclear missiles and
fusion guns; meson against meson guns). Screens reduce the
damage from the attack by 2d6+the operator's Gunnery (screens)
skill. Nuclear dampers also negate radiation hits against crew from
nuclear missiles and fusion guns.

SHIP ACTION PHASE
In each ship action phase, a ship may take one ship action per crew
position manned (including automated positions). Ship actions are
wholly internal to the ship.

Repair Damaged System
A character on damage control may attempt to repair a damaged
system by making an Education-based Mechanic check. If the check
is successful, determine how many hits are repaired:

Mechanic Mechanic
Check EffectCheck Effect Hits RepairedHits Repaired
0 1
1–5 2
6+ 3

A ship with repair drones and the Auto-Repair software also makes
one or two repair checks in the ship action phase (unless it is being
used to assist other repair attempts – see page 113 for details about
the software). The standard Auto-Repair software makes the check
with a +1 DM.

These are battlefi eld repairs only and will break down as soon as the
battle is over unless repaired properly using the rules on page 143.

Sensor Lock
A ship's sensors operator may make an Education-based Sensors
check to establish a lock on an enemy vessel. Attacks made against a
vessel that has been locked onto gain a +1 DM. When using missiles
the initial Gunner check gets this bonus – the individual missile to
hit rolls do not benefi t directly. Smart missiles are unaffected.

Electronic Warfare
A ship's sensors operator may attempt to jam radio communications
and sensor locks by making an opposed Intelligence-based Sensors
check against the sensors operator of the opposing vessel. Electronic
warfare can be used to break sensor locks.

Alternatively, electronic warfare can be used to attack smart missiles
that are targeting the ship. The sensors operator makes a Difficult (–
2) Sensors check and, if successful, a single attacking smart missile
ceases attacking. The sensors operator may continue making
checks to disable smart missiles until he fails one, with a cumulative
–1 DM each time.

Increase Initiative
The commander of a spacecraft may make a Leadership check and
increase the Initiative of his spacecraft by the Effect of the check.
This increase only applies for the following round.

Change Positions
Any characters not doing anything else may elect to swap positions
during the ship action phase. As of the next round they are considered
to be manning their new position rather than their previous one.

DAMAGE
Damage to spacecraft is tracked in two ways – by Hull and Structure
points (which represent damage to the structure of the spacecraft)
and by hits to systems such as engines and turrets. Systems can
take a variable number of hits before being destroyed, depending
on the system in question. A ship can endure one Hull damage per
fifty tons, rounding down. A ship that runs out of Hull Damage will
rapidly be incapacitated. A ship can endure one Structure damage
per fi fty tons, rounding down to a minimum of one. A ship that runs
out of Structure breaks up and is completely destroyed.

The effects of damage are determined by subtracting the ship's
armor from the damage rolled by the weapon, then consulting the
damage table to determine the number of hits infl icted. Then roll on
the Location table for each hit.

A double hit applies two hits to the same location. A triple hit applies
three hits to the same location.

Use the Small Craft table for vessels of less than 100 tons. For larger
vessels, use the External Damage table. When a ship runs out of
Hull, damage will begin to transfer to the Internal Damage table.

Spacecraft Weapons
and Personal Combat
On rare and messy occasions, characters may find themselves
using ship-scale weapons on smaller vehicles or even people.
Starship weapons are incredibly powerful and destructive – multiply
the damage from a starship weapon by 50 to get the damage in
personal-scale terms. The exceptions are sandcasters, which do
only a single point of damage against enemy spacecraft but 8d6 on
a personal scale.

PSIONICS

### PPSIONICSSIONICS

In Tr a v e l l e r a few humans – and other sophonts – have developed
potent psionic abilities such as telepathy, telekinesis and even
teleportation. In the Imperium, learning to harness this gift is
a diffi cult process, made even harder by the Imperial ban on
psionics. The Psionics Institutes that study mental powers have
gone underground, following a disastrous attempt to guide
human development centuries ago. In other civilizations, such
as the Zhodani Consulate, psionics are an accepted part of
the human condition.

Psionic Strength
Psionics are powered by the Psionic Strength characteristic
(abbreviation Psi). This characteristic cannot be rolled or bought
during character creation without the Referee's permission. To
determine a character's Psionic Strength, roll 2d6 and subtract
the number of terms served by the character in any career (Psionic
Strength diminishes over time unless actively used). For example,
a 38 year old character (fi ve terms served) would roll 2d6–5 to
determine his Psionic Strength. A character with a Psionic Strength
of 0 has no potential for psionic powers.

Using a psionic talent costs a number of Psionic Strength points,
temporarily reducing the character's total. As the Characteristic DM
for all Psionic skill checks is determined by the characters' current
Psionic Strength total, it gets harder and harder to use powers as
the character's strength declines.

Recovering Psionic Strength Points: Recovering Psionic Strength Points: Expended Psionic Strength
points are recovered at the rate of one point per hour, beginning
three hours after the character last used a psionic talent.

INSTITUTE TESTING
A character who wishes to develop psionic abilities requires training.
In settings where psionics are uncommon or illegal he must find
a teacher, normally one of the underground Psionics Institutes.
Finding such an instructor is an adventure in itself. Most teachers
will charge at least Cr. 5,000 to test the character's abilities. Testing
takes two weeks.

The fi rst step is testing a character's Psionic Strength, which is
determined as described above (2d6 – number of terms served). If the
character still has any Psionic Strength remaining, he can be trained.

Tr a i n i n g r e q u i r e s f o u r m o n t h s o f w o r k , a n d c o s t s Cr. 1 0 0 , 0 0 0. A s p a r t
of training, the character may attempt to learn any of the common
psionic talents on the Psionic Training table by making a Psionic
Strength check. He may attempt the talents in any order, but suffers
a –1 DM per check attempted. If a character learns a talent, he gains
that talent at level 0.

For example, Luka has just determined that she has a Psionic
Strength of 9. She now rolls to determine powers. She can select
powers in any order, so she begins with telekinesis. She roll 2d6+1
(her Psionic Strength DM) +2 (the Telekinesis learning DM), but
unfortunately, the dice roll is a 3 for a total of 6 – less than eight, a
failure, and so she does not develop telekinesis.

Next, she tries telepathy. She rolls 2d6 +1 (her Psionic Strength DM)
+4 (the telepathy learning DM) –1 (one previous talent acquisition
check), and gets a total of 10. Luka gains Telepathy at level 0.

PSIONIC TALENTS
There are several psionic talents, each of which works like a skill for
the powers in question. A character trained in the use of psionics
may develop his talents over time just as if they were normal skills
(see page 59). Unlike other skills, psionic talents cannot be used
untrained. The most common talents are:

- Te l e p a t h y – r e a d i n g m i n d s a n d m e n t a l c o m m u n i c a t i o n.
- Clairvoyance – perceiving at a distance.
- Te l e k i n e s i s – m i n d o v e r m a t t e r.
- Awareness – control over one's own mind and body.
- Te l e p o r t a t i o n – m o v i n g f r o m o n e p o i n t t o a n o t h e r i n s t a n t l y.

Each talent grants access to all of its powers – a character with
Te l e p a t h y 0 c a n u s e life detection, read surface thoughts or assault
as the situation demands.

Strength characteristic DM and any other DMs. He must also
spend the listed number of Psionic Strength points if he succeeds,

Special Powers
The Psionic powers described here are not the only
manifestations of psionic ability. There are other, rarer abilities
such as precognition, electrokinesis, telepathic control or astral
projection that may also be encountered, but these abilities are
usually plot devices used by the Referee.

PPSIONICSSIONICS

or one point if he fails. If this cost brings him below zero Psionic
Strength, then any excess points are applied to his Endurance score
as damage. A character with no Psionic Strength points cannot
attempt to activate a power.

Using a talent in combat is a signifi cant action.

Many abilities are ranged. The Psionic Range table lists the number
of points to project an ability out to a given range – these must
be paid as well as any points to activate the ability. Each talent
has a different set of costs, with the exception of Awareness – all
Awareness abilities apply to the Psion only. The range bands are the
same as those for combat; see page 64 for more information.

For example, a Psion could read the mind of a target at Medium
range using the Telepathy power read surface thoughts for 3 Psionic
Strength points (2 for the ability, 1 for the range).

the telepath.

LIFE DETECTION
The most elementary form of telepathy is the ability to detect the
presence of other minds. Life detectionenables a character to
sense the presence of other minds, the number of minds present,
the general type of minds (animal, human, and so on) and their
approximate location.

Life detectionis reasonably sophisticated, and can distinguish
intelligent beings from bacteria or unimportant animals in the area.
It functions best at detecting intelligent minds. Shielded minds are
undetectable (whether the shield is natural or artificial in origin). If
an individual whom the telepath knows is 'life detected' he or she
will be recognized.

TELEMPATHY
The communication of emotions and basic feelings is accomplished
by telempathy. This ability serves well in the handling of animals and

against humans. Sending of emotions such as love, hate, fear, and
others may influence other beings (although not necessarily in the
manner desired). Te l e m p a t h y also allows the emotions and feelings
of others to be read by a character. The Effect of the check determines

READ SURFACE THOUGHTS
The most widely known feature of Telepathy is the ability to read the
thoughts of other individuals. Only active, current thoughts are read
by this ability, with the subject (if himself not a telepath) unaware
of the activity. Individuals with telepathic ability cannot be read due
to the presence of their natural shields, unless they willingly lower
their shielding. The Effect of the check determines the clarity of the
telepath's perceptions.

SEND THOUGHTS
Complementary to the ability to read surface thoughts is the ability
to send thoughts to others. Such individuals need not themselves
be telepathic to receive such thoughts. Telepathic individuals are
normally open to such transmissions, but may close their shields
against them if they become bothersome or threatening.

PROBE
The application of great psionic strength will enable a telepath to
delve deep into the mind of a subject and to then read his innermost
thoughts. Questioning can be used in the procedure to force the
subject to divulge specifi c information. The prober can easily
determine deliberate untruths told (thought) by the subject. Probe
cannot be used against a shielded mind. Again, the Effect of the
check determines the clarity of the telepath's perceptions.

ASSAULT
Violence may be dealt by a telepath. An unshielded mind, when
assaulted telepathically, is rendered unconscious immediately and
the character suffers 2d6 + Effect damage. Unlike normal damage,
assault damage is applied to Psionic Strength (if the victim has it),
then Intelligence, then Endurance. Psionic Strength and Endurance
return as normal (see pages 152 and 74 respectively). Intelligence
returns at the rate of one point per day.

When a shielded mind is assaulted the two telepaths make opposed

Costs 8+Range.

SHIELD
All telepathically able characters learn how to create a mental shield
which protects the mind against unwanted telepathic interference.
Shield is automatically in force at all times and requires no Psionic
Strength point expenditure to maintain. However, while a telepath
has his shield up he cannot use any telepathic powers either. Shield
can be lowered to allow telepathic contact or to use telepathic
powers – this takes a mere thought (a free action in combat).

Clairvoyance
Clairvoyance is the general talent which allows a person to sense
events at some location displaced from the viewer. There are several
levels of clairvoyant ability. Clairvoyance abilities allow eavesdropping
activities as well as spying and detection-free exploration of
situations. While telepathic life detection will determine the presence
of living minds in a closed room, for example, sense will determine
if a room is occupied or empty. Clairvoyant activity cannot be sensed
by others, including by other psionic individuals.

SENSE
The basic ability to sense things at some point in the distance. A
character will become aware of the most rudimentary characteristics
of a location when applying this ability. For example, the Referee
will give a basic description, without detail: 'a room containing four

dogs' or 'an open plain with a tree, and no animals or men present'.
The clairvoyant character must state the range at which he is
applying his talent, and will generally sense the most interesting or
important feature at that range. The Effect of the check determines
the level of accuracy and clarity.

Clairvoyance, Psionic Strength, 10–60 seconds, Routine (+2).
Costs 1+Range.

TACTICAL AWARENESS
With this ability, the character can perceive dangers and foes around
him using his clairvoyant abilities. This enhanced spatial perception
allows him to ignore the effects of darkness, smoke, fog or other
environmental effects that impede vision. He may also detect hidden
foes within range. The Effect of the check how long the enhanced
awareness lasts in rounds.

Clairvoyance, Psionic Strength, 1–6 seconds, Average (+0).
Costs 2+Range

CLAIRVOYANCE
This specifi c ability allows actual remote viewing of a situation
at some displaced point. Rather than the 'snapshot' that sense
gives, clairvoyance allows the psion to observe as if he was there
in person. The clairvoyant character must state the range at which
he is applying his talent. The Effect of the check determines the
level of detail perceived and the duration in rounds the vision
can be maintained for.

Clairvoyance, Psionic Strength, 10–60 seconds, Average (+0).
Costs 2+Range.

CLAIRAUDIENCE
This ability is identical to clairvoyance, with the exception that it
allows hearing instead of seeing.

Clairvoyance, Psionic Strength, 10–60 seconds, Average (+0).
Costs 2+Range.

CLAIRSENTIENCE
This power combines the effects of clairvoyance and clairaudience.
The character is capable of both seeing and hearing a specific
situation.

Clairvoyance, Psionic Strength, 10–60 seconds, Diffi cult (–2).
Costs 3+Range.

danger, pain, or other stimuli are not present. Telekinesis includes
a limited amount of sensory awareness, sufficient to allow actual
intelligent manipulation.

TELEKINESIS
This basic form of the talent allows the character to move objects
at range. The Effect of the check determines the duration of the
telekinesis in rounds. The number of points spent determines the
Strength of the Telekinesis.

By applying telekinesis to his own body the character can fly, or
at least levitate over short distances. The character can fly for a
number of rounds equal to the Effect of the check at a speed of six
meters per round.

Awareness
Awareness is the psionic talent which allows control of one's
own body. Awareness powers never have a range – they are used
only on yourself.

SUSPENDED ANIMATION
Personal body activity may be suspended for varying periods of time.
A character with Awareness may enter a suspended animation state
(similar to cold sleep but without the intrinsic danger of death) by
willing himself into it. Such a state continues for 7 days without need
for food or water and with minimal air needs. Such a person could
effectively travel in a low passage berth without actually undergoing
cold sleep and its dangers. Suspended animation may be stopped at
any time previous to its duration expiring, provided external stimulus is
given to awaken the sleeper (such as a friend or a mechanical alarm).

Awareness, Psionic Strength, 1–6 minutes, Average (+0).
Costs 3.

ENHANCED AWARENESS
By focussing his mind, the character can improve his concentration
and ability to perform complex tasks. While under the effects of
enhanced awareness, the character may add his Psionic Strength
DM (if positive) to any skill checks. Enhanced awareness lasts until
the character fails a skill check or sleeps.

Awareness, Psionic Strength, 1–6 seconds, Average (+0).
Costs 1.

PSIONICALLY ENHANCED STRENGTH
Psionic Strength points may be converted to normal Strength points
on a temporary basis. The character makes the commitment, reduces
his Psionic Strength by a specific number of points, and increases
his physical Strength characteristic by that number. In no case may
the number of Strength points gained exceed the character's current
level in Awareness, and Strength may not be increased beyond the
character's racial maximum. Psionically enhanced strength reaches
its new level immediately, remains at that peak for ten minutes, and
then declines at the rate of 1 Strength point per minute until the
normal Strength level is reached. This power works as normal on
wounded characters but their Strength returns to the wounded level
rather than the normal value. It cannot be used as a 'quick heal'.

Awareness, Psionic Strength, 1–6 seconds, Average (+0).
Costs boosted Strength.

PSIONICALLY ENHANCED ENDURANCE
Psionically enhanced endurance works in exactly the same way as
psionically enhanced strength except the characteristic boosted is
Endurance rather than Strength, including its lack of healing ability.

Awareness, Psionic Strength, 1–6 seconds, Average (+0).
Costs boosted Endurance.

PPSIONICSSIONICS PPSIONICSSIONICS

REGENERATION
Wounds and injuries may be healed rapidly. Strength, Dexterity
and Endurance lost to injury, disease, poison or other trauma may
be healed by the application of this ability, exchanging one Psionic
Strength point to regenerate one characteristic point. Any amount of
Psionic Strength may be expended with a single use of regeneration
but it may not be used again until all expended Psionic Strength is
recovered. Regeneration may also be applied to the growing of new
limbs or organs to replace lost ones or to heal unrecovered old
wounds suffered prior to psionic training. Regeneration may not be
used to counteract aging. Awareness is not capable of affecting others
and may not be used for healing or enhancing other characters.

Awareness, Psionic Strength, 10–60 seconds, Very Diffi cult (–4).
Costs amount healed.

BODY ARMOR
By channelling psionic strength to his skeletal structure and
boosting his healing rate, the character can enhance his ability to
absorb damage. Body armor lasts for a number of rounds equal to
the Effect of the check and provides an armor rating equal to the
number of Psionic Strength points expended. This armor stacks
with worn armor as normal.

Awareness, Psionic Strength, 1–6 seconds, Very Diffi cult (–4).
Costs amount healed.

Teleportation
Te l e p o r t a t i o n i s a t a l e n t w h i c h a l l o w s e f f e c t i v e l y i n s t a n t a n e o u s
movement from one point to another point without regard to
intervening matter. Psionic teleportation is limited to the movement
of the teleported character's body and (for highly skilled teleporters)
his or her clothing and weapons.

Unlike the other talents, Teleportation has only a single power: the
ability to teleport yourself. Teleporting without any equipment or
clothing uses the Teleportation talent with the Psionic Strength DM
as a modifi er. The act of teleporting takes 1–6 seconds (a signifi cant
action in combat) and costs nothing except what the psion spends
on range.

Alien HorrorAlien Horror
Many worlds harbour creatures dangerous to humans, from predators that have little fear of guns to lethal bacterial or fungal infections.
On settled worlds, the inhabitants have taken precautions to deal with such threats – dangerous creatures are hunted to extinction or
driven to the deepest wilderness, while medical treatments are developed to cure native pathogens. Still, unwary travellers or explorers
of uncharted planets can run afoul of such dangers.

The alien horror...

1. ...is a rare predator that has wandered into civilization.
2. ...is being chased by an eccentric noble hunter.
3. ...is a previously unknown and highly dangerous life form.
4. ...was deliberately released by an enemy, who is trying to kill the characters but wants to make it appear an accident.
5. ...was imported from another world. Perhaps it escaped from the starport, or from a crashed ship.
6. ...is actually intelligent, but is so different that communication may be impossible.

Psionic PhenomenonPsionic Phenomenon
Ever since the psionics suppression, understanding of psychic phenomena in the Imperium is limited. Those who develop powers are
often mistrusted and feared, and without the guidance of the Institutes, they cannot easily learn to control or hone their abilities. The
sudden blossoming of a Psionic talent can sow chaos in a community.

The psionic phenomenon...

1. ... is a teleporting thief or assassin, who uses his talent to bypass security systems.
2. ... is a dream projected by a troubled telepath that is driving other insane.
3. ... is being investigated by Imperial agents, who are searching for an underground Institute.
4. ... is a product of Zhodani manipulation.
5. ... involves psi-drug smuggling.
6. ... is the product of a Psionic doomsday cult.

PSIONICS PPPPSIONICSSIONICSSIONICSSIONICS

Preknowledge of Destination: Preknowledge of Destination: A character must always have a
mental image of his or her destination before teleporting. This
mental image is acquired by personally visiting the location first (or
viewing it from a distance), having the mental image implanted in
one's mind (by telepathy) by another person who has visited the
destination, or by viewing the location through clairvoyance. The
key to remember is that someone has to actually view the location

- recorded images are not enough.

Energy and Momentum: Energy and Momentum: Teleportation involves serious restrictions
on movement in order to assure the conservation of energy and
momentum.

On planetary surfaces, teleportation is restricted to jumps of
Very Distant range or less. Jumps at Very Distant range involve
disorientation for a period of 20 to 120 seconds (2d6 10) after
arrival. This restriction results from the law of conservation of
momentum: on a rotating planet, two locations will have different
rotational speeds and directions. A jump from a point on the Earth's
equator to one of its poles would result in a total velocity difference
between the character and his surroundings of over 3300 kph, which
would lead to a messy death in short order.

Te l e p o r t i n g t o o r f r o m v e h i c l e s t r a v e l l i n g a t h i g h s p e e d c a n a l s o
result in energy gains or losses. When teleporting into, onto or out
of a fast-moving vehicle the psion takes damage as if the vehicle had
rammed him at its current speed (see page 66).

Changes in altitude (actually all movement to locations of differing
gravitational potential) will result in potential energy changes,
manifesting themselves as changes in body temperature. A jump of
one kilometer straight down will result in a temperature increase of
2.5 degrees Celsius; this is suffi cient to cause extreme fever, brain
damage, and even death. A jump up will cool the body by the same
amount, with equally serious results. To be safe, a jump may not
involve an elevation change of more than 400 meters, and multiple
jumps should not involve a cumulative elevation change or more
than 600 meters in one hour. These problems may be gotten around
through the use of technological devices: energy compensators,
heated suits, and other means. Characters may feel driven to invent
such materials, commission their invention, or seek them out from
those who already have them.

PSIONIC TECHNOLOGY
The ban on psionics within the Imperium means that most of these
technologies are illegal. The exception is anti-psionic devices like
the psionic shield or inhibitor drugs.

Psi-Drugs (TL 8+): Psi-Drugs (TL 8+): These drugs restore Psionic Strength if taken
when the character has already spent Psionic Strength points, or
temporarily increase the character's Psionic Strength if taken when
he is at full Psionic Strength.

A character who takes more than one dose of Standard or Double
Psi-Drug, or a single dose of the Special drug must make an
Endurance check, with a –1 DM per dose of psi-drug taken in the
last week (not including the one just taken). If the check is failed
the character falls ill with a serious fever, suffering 3d6 damage and
permanently reducing his Psionic Strength by one.

Inhibitor Drug (TL 9): Inhibitor Drug (TL 9): Psionic inhibitors dampen the brain's ability
to generate psychic effects. A character who takes (or, more often, is
forcibly injected with) an inhibitor drug suffers a –4 DM to all Psionic
Strength checks and cannot regain Psionic Strength points. Each
hour the character may make an Endurance check to throw off the
effects of the drug with a +1 DM for every previous check. Inhibitor
drugs have no effect on non-psionic individuals. The drugs cost
Cr. 500 per dose.

Psionic Shield (TL 12): Psionic Shield (TL 12): Any armor incorporating a helmet or hood
can be outfi tted with a psionic shield, blocking Telepathy. Unlike
the Telepathy power shield a technological shield is invulnerable
to assault and blocks send thoughts. It cannot be lowered without
removing the helmet or hood containing the shield. Cr. 40,000.

Buildings and vehicles can also be psionically shielded, but this is
much more costly, increasing the cost by 10%.

suit of armor or worn as a form-hugging body-suit. It rapidly
cools or warms the body after a teleport, minimising the damage
from sudden energy gains or losses. The suit costs Cr. 50,000
and allows a character to jump up to 600 meters up or down in
a single teleport, or up to ten kilometers in a single hour when
using successive jumps.

Psionic Interface (TL 14): Psionic Interface (TL 14): Any weapon or technological device can
be outfi tted with a psionic interface. A character using a device
with a psionic interface can use his Psionic Strength DM instead
of his Dexterity DM when using the weapon or device; a character
without psionic ability cannot use the device. The character must
either touch the device or use telekinesis to interact with it at range.
Adding a psionic interface increases the cost of the device by 20%.

A character may only attempt to enter the Psion career with the
permission of the Referee. One life event (see page 34) allows a
character to fi nd a Psionics Institute and begin his training during
character generation; some campaigns may allow access to psionics
for any character.

TRADE

### TTRADERADE

Free traders traditionally deal in three forms of commerce –
passenger shipping, freight shipping, and speculative trade.

PASSENGERS
Passage on board ship is standardised into three categories – low
passage, middle passage, and high passage.

PASSAGE TYPES

CategoryCategory RequirementsRequirements
High Stateroom, one displacement ton of cargo space, steward
Middle Stateroom, 100 kg of cargo, steward
Low Low Berth, 10 kg baggage allowance

High passage is the equivalent of a luxury cruise or a flight in fi rst
class – comfortable quarters, good food, and staff to wait on you
hand and foot.

Middle passage is 'standard class'. A stateroom to yourself and
occasional service from the steward but more of a functional way of
getting somewhere than an enjoyable experience.

Low passage is being cryogenically frozen and stuffed into a tube to
be unfrozen at your destination. It is not unknown for low passengers
to die in transit, whether from the system shock of being frozen,

The cost of passage varies depending on the distance:

The number of travellers seeking passage to a given destination varies
depending on where the ship is going and its current location. Add
the current planet's Population value (see page 172) to the Passenger

Characters can attempt to seek out passengers using Carouse or
Streetwise checks; add half the Effect to the traffi c value if successful.
Other factors may also play into the number of passengers
available – for example, a war might induce people to leave a
world, while a tourist attraction or booming economy would draw
people to a planet.

For example, the Beowulf is docked at an asteroid mine (Population
3), and is heading for a rich world. The Traffi c Value is 3 +1 (leaving
asteroid) +2 (heading to rich world) for a total traffi c value of 6.
There will be 3d6–1d6 low passages available, 3d6–1d6 middle
passages, and 3d6–2d6 high passages.

More details on passengers can be found on page 142. The number
of passengers available cannot usually exceed the number of people
resident on a planet, except in unusual circumstances (for example,
a passenger liner might break down in a nearly uninhabited system,
so a planet with a population of only a few dozen might have
hundreds of passengers clamouring for transport out).

FREIGHT
Characters not wishing to risk speculative trade can go for the
safer option of shipping freight. Freight shipments pay Cr. 1,000
per ton for shipping a ton for one parsec, +200 Cr. per additional
parsec. Freight lots must be transported in their entirety, and come
in three sizes:

- Major cargos are composed of 1d6 10 tons of freight.
- Minor cargos are composed of 1d6 5 tons of freight.
- Incidental cargos are composed of 1d6 tons of freight.

planet's Population value to the modifiers from the Freight Traffi c
table, then consult the Freight Lots Available table.

A freight lot cannot be broken up. Cargo is paid for upon delivery,
assuming it is delivered on time. Failing to deliver cargo on time
reduces the amount paid by 1d6+4 10%.

Mail
Mail is a special form of freight, consisting of large data storage
drums which contain a vast amount of information that must be
transported from one world to another, but is not vital enough to be

Steward Requirements
Each level, including level 0, of the Steward skill allows a character
to care for two high passage passengers or five middle passage
passengers. A steward can 'mix' his levels of Steward skill to
care for High and Middle passengers at the same time.

Imperial CImperial Creditredit
The basic unit of legal tender in the Imperium is the Imperial credit. Individual worlds may issue their own currencies, and those currencies may or may not be acceptable
on other worlds. Similarly, corporations and megacorporations may issue scrip, and its acceptance outside of the corporate environment is a matter of conjecture. But
Imperial credits are accepted everywhere in the Imperium and in many locations outside of it.

Imperial credits are almost impossible to counterfeit because of their unique method of manufacture. Plastic fi bres are combined under high temperature and pressure
and extruded as a rectangular bundle of great length. The different coloured fi bres form the pattern of the bill. It is not printed on but actually made a part of the structure
of the note. The bundle is sliced to paper thinness, and a 14-digit alphanumeric (letter/number combination) is added for uniqueness. Credit bills are issued in 10, 20,
50, 100, 500, 1000, and 10,000 credit denominations. Plastic coins, manufactured in a similar manner in various shapes, are issued in quarter, half, one, and fi ve credit
denominations. The larger coins are often called the kilo, the ton, the toi, the low passage and the high passage, to reflect their value.

SPECULATIVE TRADE AND SMUGGLING
The greatest profi ts and losses are to be found in speculative trade

- buying low and selling high across the stars.

Trade Checklist

1. Find a supplier.
2. Determine goods available.
a. Common Goods are always available.
b. Trade Goods matching the Trade Codes of the planet are always
    available.
c. 1d6 random Trade Goods are available.
3. Determine the amount of each type of goods available.
4. Choose which goods you wish to purchase.
5. Determine purchase price for the goods, rolling 3d6+DMs.
6. Purchase goods.
7. Travel to another market.
8. Find a buyer.
9. Determine sale price for the goods you wish to sell, rolling
    3d6+DMs.

Finding a Supplier
On worlds that are regularly visited by trade vessels, finding a
supplier is easy. There are traders and brokers at the starport, eager
to deal with offworlders, and the whole planetary economy may
rely on trade with other planets. Technologically advanced worlds
will have computer networks that can be searched for suppliers.
On lower-tech worlds, traders will have to seek out suppliers in the

TRADE TTRADERADE

markets and bazaars themselves. Characters can search for multiple
suppliers, but there is a –1 DM per previous attempt on a planet in
a given month.

Finding a supplier: Broker, Education or Social Standing, 1–6 days,
Average (+0).
Finding a black market supplier: (Illegal goods only) Streetwise,
Education or Social Standing, 1–6 days, Average (+0).
Finding an online supplier: (Worlds with TL 8+ only) Computers,
Education, 1–6 hours, Average (+0).

The size of the Starport provides a bonus to finding a supplier. Class
A starports give a +6 DM, class B starports give a +4 DM and class
C starports give a +2 DM.

Determine Goods Available
Goods are divided into two categories of goods – Common and
Tr a d e G o o d s. Co m m o n G o o d s c a n b e p u r c h a s e d o n a n y w o r l d.
Tr a d e G o o d s c a n u s u a l l y o n l y b e f o u n d o n a w o r l d w i t h a m a t c h i n g
trade code. The amount of each type of goods available is limited

- the tons column determines how many tons of a given type of
goods are available for purchase.

A given supplier has all Common Goods available, the Trade Goods
that match the world's trade code, and 1d6 randomly determined
goods. Roll d66 on the table to determine the goods available,
ignoring results 61–65 unless dealing with a black market supplier.
If you roll the same type of goods multiple times, then the supplier
has extra amounts of those goods available.

Some goods are illegal, and can be purchased only through a
black market supplier. A black market supplier has whatever illegal
goods match his world's trade code, as well as any randomly
rolled illegal goods.

For example, the characters have contacted a supplier on an
Industrial world. Consulting the table below, the supplier has the
following goods available: Basic Electronics, Basic Machine Parts,
Basic Manufactured Goods, Basic Raw Materials, Basic Vehicles,
Basic Ore, Advanced Electronics, Advanced Machine Parts,

Advanced Manufactured Goods, Advanced Weapons, Advanced
Vehicles, Polymers and Robots, as all those goods are Common or
Industrial.

The Referee then rolls 1d6 to determine other goods that are
available. He rolls a 3, so he rolls d66 three times. The fi rst result
is a 25 – Advanced Vehicles, which means there is an extra 1d6
5 tons of Advanced Vehicles available for purchase. Next, he
rolls a 51 – Spices, which are not normally available on Industrial
worlds but can be bought from this particular supplier at this time.
Finally, he rolls a 63 – Illegal Drugs. As the characters are dealing
with a legitimate supplier instead of a black-market supplier,
this roll is ignored.

Determine Purchase Price

modifi ers:

- + the character's Broker skill (or the local broker's skill).
- + the character's Intelligence or Social Standing DM, whichever
    is higher.
- + the largest Dice Modifi er from the Purchase DM column.
- - the largest Dice Modifi er from the Sale DM column.
- - any Dice Modifi ers from the supplier. Some especially rich or
    powerful suppliers can demand high prices.

In cases where multiple Purchase or Sale DMs apply, use only the
largest ones from each column.

Next, consult the Purchase column of the Modified Price table. The
trader does not have to accept this price, but if he rejects the deal,
then he cannot deal with that supplier again for at least one week.
After that week, he may reroll one of the dice thrown to determine
the purchase price for those goods.

For example, the Beowulf lands on a Desert world. Erik finds a
supplier, who has the following goods available by default.

ItemItem Cost (Cr.)Cost (Cr.) Purchase DMPurchase DM
Basic Electronics 25,000 +0
Basic Machine Parts 10,000 +0
Basic Manufactured Goods 20,000 +0

Precious Metals 50,000 +1
Radioactives 1,000,000 +0
Spices 6,000 +2
Uncommon Raw Materials 20,000 +0

The merchant has no unusual trade goods available.

Local Brokers and Guides
A trader can hire a local guide to help him find a supplier, or a
local broker to help him negotiate a deal.

A local guide costs 1d6 100
Credits to fi nd a supplier, or
1d6 500 Credits to fi nd a black
market supplier.

A broker will take a percentage
of the purchase or sale price in
exchange for using his Broker
skill to negotiate the deal.

TRADE TRADE

Deciding that precious metals offer the best return, Erik negotiates
a price. He rolls 3d6, +1 (purchase DM), +1 (his Broker skill), for a
total of 12. This lets him purchase the precious metals at 90% of
base price, or for 45,000 per ton. He rolls 1d6 to see how many tons
of precious metals are available for him and rolls a 6. Buying all six
tons of precious metals costs him 270,000 Credits.

He fi lls the remainder of his (small) hold with petrochemicals. He
rolls 3d6, +2 (purchase DM) +1 (his Broker skill) for a total of 10,
letting him buy petrochemicals at market value (10,000 Credits
per ton). He rolls 1d6 10 for availability and rolls a 5, meaning
he can purchase up to 50 tons of petrochemicals. He only has 16
tons of space remaining in his hold so he purchases 16 tons of
petrochemicals for 160,000 Credits.

Selling Goods
Selling goods works just like purchasing goods, with the following
changes:

- A character must fi nd a buyer, instead of a supplier. The same
    rules apply.
- When selling goods, add the largest Sale DMs for the world
    trade code and subtract the largest Purchase DMs.

If a character does not accept the price offered for his goods, he
must fi nd another buyer or wait a week, in which case he may reroll
one of the dice thrown to determine the purchase price.

For example, Erik has his six tons of precious metals. They sell best
at Rich worlds, but there are no Rich worlds within jump range.
There is, however, an Industrial world. Erik jumps there and fi nds
a buyer for his cargo of metal. To determine the sale price, he rolls
3d6 +3 (sale DM) +1 (his Broker skill) for a total of 15. Consulting
the table, this gives a sale price of 125% of base, or 62,500 per ton.
Erik sells his cargo of 6 tons for 375,000 credits.

He also tries to sell his sixteen tons of petrochemicals, but rolls
only a 6, meaning that the best offer he gets is only 80% of the base
cost, or 8,000 credits per ton. Unwilling to sell at a loss, Erik spends
another few days fi nding another buyer and rolls again. This time,
he gets an offer of 10,500 credits per ton, which he accepts.

Erik has made 8,000 credits on his petrochemicals, and 105,000
credits on his precious metals.

Illegal Goods
Some goods are illegal throughout the Imperium. These are
marked as illegal in the Trade Goods tables. Other goods are illegal
only on particular member worlds (see Law Level, page 173).

Tr a d e i n i l l e g a l g o o d s i s h i g h l y p r o fi t a b l e , b u t r i s k y. U n i v e r s a l l y
illegal goods have high Sale DMs. For other banned goods,
their Sale DM is the difference between the Law Level they are
banned at and the Law Level of the world. For example, Military
Weapons are banned at Law Level 3. If a trader smuggles any
weapons onto a Law Level 9 world, the weapons have a +6 Sale
DM. (If a type of goods is both universally and locally illegal, use
whichever Sale DM is higher.)

The downside of smuggling is that if the trader is caught, he
faces fi nes or imprisonment. See Law Levels, page 173.

### WWORLDORLD C CREATIONREATION

The universe is mapped in convenient segments, called subsectors.
Each subsector is an area of hexagonal cells measuring eight
hexes by ten hexes. Since the recommended scale is one parsec
(3.26 light years) per hex, the subsector covers an area ten parsecs
by eight parsecs.

Sixteen subsectors (arranged in four rows of four subsectors each)
form a sector, probably the largest size practical for a continuing
Tr a v e l l e r c a m p a i g n. M a p p i n g s u b s e c t o r s c o n s i s t s o f t w o s e q u e n c e s :
star mapping and world creation. Star mapping examines each
hexagon in the subsector grid and determines if there is a star system
present. It also determines the presence or absence of starports,
bases, and fuel for starships. All of this information is coded onto
the subsector hexes, and serves as a guide to the Referee and to
the players during interstellar travel. World creation examines the
single most important world in each system and determines the
basic characteristics for it. This information is retained for use in
adventures on the world's surface.

Some campaigns may eschew star mapping, using an existing
sector map (such as the Spinward Marches), or focussing on a
single star system.

Star Mapping
In order to create a subsector, the Referee uses a blank subsector
grid and dice to determine the presence of systems, starports, and
bases. The system hex format table shows the coding and placement
of information about worlds within a subsector. This format should
be used to allow players and Referees to note the information that
would normally be available to them. The Referee may elect to omit
some information, and only allow it to be inserted after the players
have determined it themselves.

World Occurrence: World Occurrence: There is a basic one-half chance normally
that a world (and its attendant stellar system) will be in a hex.
Systematically check each hex on the subsector map, throwing one
die and marking the hex with a circle if the result is a 4, 5, or 6. This
indicates that a world is present; otherwise, leave the hex blank.

The Referee may elect to alter the normal chances of worlds, making
them more frequent or less frequent to correspond to specific
regions of the galaxy. A 50% density (no DM) is appropriate for the
spiral arms of the galaxy. Apply a –2 DM for 'rift sectors', a –1 DM
for sparse sectors and a +1 DM for densely populated sectors.

Starport Type: Starport Type: Many worlds have starports, their presence being
essential to interstellar trade and commerce. See Starports, page 178.

Bases: Bases: Stellar systems may have bases for military forces, the
navy, the scouts, or for other arms of interstellar government. See
Bases, page 179.

Bases will also help determine political boundaries in the sector. An
interstellar government will place bases along its borders to guard
against aggression from rival states, or to control local systems. The
presence of multiple bases within a few parsecs might indicate a
contested border, or a mighty stronghold.

Gas Giants: Gas Giants: A star system may have one or more gas giant planets
(similar to Jupiter or Saturn). The presence of a gas giant allows
starships equipped with fuel scoops to refuel by skimming; this
eliminates fuel cost for the vessel and increases profi t. It also allows
refuelling at systems that do not have starports. Refuelling in this
fashion requires 1–6 hours. Fuel gained by skimming is unrefined.

Gas giants are relatively common. For each system throw 10+ on
2d6 for at least one gas giant not to be present in the system. If one
is present, mark the system hex.

System Name: System Name: Each system is generally named for the primary
world within. This name should be decided upon by the Referee and
placed in the hex for identifi cation.

Tr a v e l Z o n e s : Tr a v e l Z o n e s : M o s t w o r l d s a r e a s s u m e d t o b e c i v i l i z e d , o r a t l e a s t
amenable to travellers and visitors. Some, however, are caught
in the throes of war, plagued by disease, or simply not ready for
interstellar visitors. Such worlds are classifi ed by travel zones to
denote such status. In most cases, the Referee should indicate
travel zones based on the information available. Two such zone
types exist: amber and red.

Amber travel zones indicate that travellers should exercise caution
when visiting such worlds. The amber code may mean that the
citizens of the world are xenophobic, that the political situation is
chaotic, or that some other danger exists within the system.

WORLD CREATION WORLD CREATION

Red travel zone usually indicates that a major danger exists
within the system. This danger may be disease and the world is
quarantined. The system may be involved in a war, and surface or
space battles may be probable. Red travel zones are also used to
show a government edict prohibiting entry to the system or world.
This may be to protect a local civilization which is still developing
and not yet ready for interstellar contacts, or to protect valuable
resources until the government can mine them.

Tr a v e l z o n e s a r e d i s c u s s e d f u r t h e r i n Wo r l d Cr e a t i o n , p a g e 1 6 7.

Polities: Polities: Worlds may be independent, or part of a larger polity that
spans a system or more. Polities range from loose confederations
of a few worlds with common trade or defence policies or cultural
links, to vast star empires containing thousand of systems and
trillions of citizens. Polity borders should be drawn on the map.
Note that larger polities will usually have sub-domains, which
should also be marked.

Communications Routes: Communications Routes: Within the subsector, local governments
will have established communications routes connecting some
(but not all) worlds. These routes serve as a conduit for messages
between businesses and between governments as well as between
people. The also serve as the basic routes that liners and large
freighters travel. The Referee should examine the subsector map and
connect key worlds with communications routes. If the subsector is
an isolated community, the routes may not leave the map; if it is part
of a larger confederation or empire, the routes will probably leave
the edges to join with other parts of the sector. Use the starports
as guides when drawing communication routes – in general, the
best routes are the shortest connections between Class-A starports,
naval bases and imperial consulates.

Communications routes should be carefully drawn so as to avoid
making all parts of the subsector accessible; a subsector should
have some areas as backwaters for exploration and adventure.
Communications routes are drawn as single lines connecting hexes
on the subsector grid.

The star map, once generated, shows the distribution of star systems
in space, and shows their relationships to each other in terms of
relative distance and commercial space-lane connections.

WORLD CREATION
The term world refers to the various bodies that are contained in
a stellar system; it encompasses planets, satellites, and asteroid
belts. For example, the single most important world in a system
may not be a planet; it could be a satellite of a gas giant, or it could
be a planetoid within an asteroid belt.

The worlds contained in the star systems on the subsector map may
be further classifi ed in terms of their gross physical characteristics
and their effects on persons living on them or travelling to them.
These characteristics indicate specific facts about a world through
the use of a numeric rating.

This world creation process is usually only carried out for the
mainworld in a system, the most habitable planet in that star
system. Almost all systems have additional planets but these are far
less habitable. They can be generated by the Referee as necessary.

The basic planetary characteristics are Size, Atmosphere, Hydrology,
Population, Government, Law Level, Technology Level, Starport and
Bases, and are generated using two-dice throws, with DMs applied
based on other characteristics. These characteristics establish the
basic identity of a world, and are referred to as the Universal World
Profi le (UWP). Additional information can be generated, and should
be, to more fully describe a world.

When originally generating a world, a subsector index containing
world name, location, universal world profile, and other basic data
should be compiled. This listing should be available to players
who travel through the subsector. In addition, the Referee should
generate other information which may be pertinent; this may include
details of other planets in the star system, radiation characteristics
of the star, the types of terrain present on the planetary surface,
unique encounter tables (as described by the section on animal
encounters on page 69), data on flora and fauna, industrial or
agricultural capacity, data on social structure and government, or
possibly actual maps of the planetary surface.

Routes
In the Third Imperium travel routes are classified by the kind
of Jump drive necessary to make them. This is because of
simple refuelling issues – few starships carry enough fuel to
make multiple Jumps in succession, so they must make sure to
Jump only to places where they can refuel, either at a starport
or by skimming fuel from gas giants or water-bearing worlds. A
Jump–1 route has a starport or gas giant in every hex, a Jump–2
route has at least one one-hex 'gap' between refuelling points, a
Jump–3 route has at least one two-hex 'gap' between refuelling
points, and so on. In this way starship captains know that any
route classifi ed at less than or equal to their Jump capability can
be travelled with no risk of becoming stranded in deep space.

WORLD CREATION WORLD CREATION

SIZE
The Size characteristic for inhabitable worlds ranges from 0 to
10, and is determined by rolling 2d6–2. Size measures a world's
diameter in thousands of kilometers. The bigger a planet, the higher
its gravity. The values for gravity in the table below assume that the
world has a density similar to that of Earth. Worlds like gas giants
have a lower gravity than their size would indicate, while extremely
dense worlds have a higher gravity.

Intelligent species (sophonts) are unlikely to evolve on worlds smaller
than Size 4 or 5. Larger planets tend to imply larger populations, as
there is more room for expansion.

Worlds of Size 1 or less are asteroids, orbital complexes, space
stations and other small satellites, and are much too small to retain
a breathable atmosphere. They are uninhabitable by most forms of
life without technological support.

High and Low Gravity Worlds
Worlds where the gravity is 0.75 or less are low-gravity worlds.
Common features include improbable-looking rock formations,
thin and spindly life forms and fl ying as a common form of
locomotion (assuming the atmosphere is thick enough to support
flyers). Humans tend to fi nd life on low-gravity worlds to be initially
pleasant, but regular exercise regimes and medicinal supplements
are required to prevent bone and muscle degradation. Those who
spent too long on low-gravity worlds cannot tolerate higher gravities.
Characters on low-gravity worlds suffer a –1 DM to all skill checks
until they acclimatise, a process which takes 1d6 weeks. Characters
with the Zero-G skill at level 0 or better acclimatise instantly.

High-gravity worlds have a gravity 1.25 times or more than of Earth.
They tend to be extremely dense worlds; common features include
wide rocky plains, squat, muscular creatures, and plant life that
spreads out like lichen instead of growing up. Crawling, burrowing
or swimming are the commonest forms of locomotion. Humans
find high-gravity worlds unpleasant. Especially high-gravity worlds
require the use of pressured or powered suits to support the human
frame. Characters on high-gravity worlds suffer a –1 DM to all skill
checks until they acclimatise, a process which takes 1d6 weeks.

ATMOSPHERE
The Atmosphere characteristic measures the type of atmosphere
present. A planet's Atmosphere is generated by rolling 2d6–7 and
adding the planet's Size.

Atmosphere Types

A character who breathes a tainted atmosphere without a filter will
suffer 1d6 damage every few minutes (or hours, depending on the
level of taint).

otherwise hazardous. A character needs an air supply to breath in
an exotic atmosphere.

each round.

Dense, High (D)Dense, High (D): These worlds have thick N2/O2 atmospheres,
but their mean surface pressure is too high to support unprotected
human life (high pressure nitrogen and oxygen are deadly to
humans). However, pressure naturally decreases with increasing
altitude, so if there are highlands at the right altitude the pressure
may drop enough to support human life. Alternatively, there may not
be any topography high enough for humans to inhabit, necessitating
floating gravitic or dirigible habitats or sealed habitats on the surface.

Thin, Low (E)Thin, Low (E): The opposite of the Dense, High atmosphere,
these massive worlds have thin N2/O2 atmospheres that settle
in the lowlands and depressions and are only breathable there

- the pressure drops off so rapidly with altitude that the highest
topographic points of the surface may be close to vacuum.

Unusual (F): Unusual (F): An Unusual atmosphere is a catchall term for an
atmosphere that behaves in a strange manner. Examples include
ellipsoidal atmospheres, which are thin at the poles and dense at the
equator; Panthalassic worlds composed of a rocky core surrounded
by a water layer hundreds of kilometers thick; worlds wracked by
storms so intense that that the local air pressure changes from
dense to thin depending on the current wearther; and other planets
with unusual and hazardous atmospheric conditions.

World Temperature
A planet's surface temperature is primarily dependent on its
distance from its sun (how much solar radiation it receives)
and how thick its atmosphere is (how much of this heat it can
retain). The habitable zone is the area around a star which is
most conducive to the development of Earth-like, habitable
worlds, and it is assumed that most colonized worlds will be
in this habitable zone. Roll 2d6 for the planet's temperature,
applying the DMs listed below.

Hydrographics
The Hydrographic characteristic measures the amount of surface
liquid, and hence the amount of dry land on the world. Hydrographic
percentage goes from 0 to 10, measuring the surface liquid in
increments of 10%. For normal worlds, this will be water; on other
worlds with corrosive or exotic atmospheres, it could be a corrosive
or exotic liquid like ammonia. Hydrographic percentage is obtained
by rolling 2d6–7 and adding the planet's Size, modifi ed by the
planet's atmosphere or size as described below:

Size 0 or 1 Hydrographics 0
Atmosphere 0, 1, A, B or C –4

POPULATION
The Population characteristic measures, obviously, the planet's
population. The Population digit can be viewed as the number
of zeroes following a one, so a population of 6 indicates a
population in the millions (1,000,000). Population is generated
by rolling 2d6–2:

Low-Population Worlds
Planets with a Population of 6 or less are very small colonies, and
may differ considerably from the descriptions in the rest of this
chapter. A world with a Population of 1 can change its government
type with an argument over dinner, and is unlikely to bother with a
worldwide network of communications satellites even at TL 15.

WORLD CREATION WWORLDORLD C CREATIONREATION

If a world has a population of 0, it is uninhabited and so has a
Government, Law Level and Technology Level of 0.

GOVERNMENT
The Government characteristic indicates a range of possible ruling
systems, and is determined by rolling 2d6–7 and adding the planet's
Population. Compare the result with the Government table on the
following page.

The 'common contraband' column determines goods such a
government is likely to restrict, but should not be taken as a
universal rule.

Rivals, Factions, Connections and Colonies
The government code determines the dominant government
type on that planet, but there are usually other factions such rival
political parties, cultural groups, religions, rebels and so forth who
oppose the government. Conflicts on a planet often involve the
player characters; they might be hired to smuggle weapons to a
rebel group, or be asked to investigate a political scandal involving
a government leader.

Roll 1d3 to determine how many factions there are on the planet,
with a DM of +1 if the government type is 0 or 7, and a DM of
–1 if the government type is 10 or more. Determine what 'mini-
government' each faction uses on the government table. In cases
where the faction type is the same as the current government type
(or similar, such as two democracies or two dictatorships), then it
is a splinter faction within the ruling government. In cases where
it is radically different (anarchists against a bureaucracy), then the
faction is a rebel group or movement.

Roll 2d6 to determine the strength of each faction:

FACTION STRENGTH TABLE
RollRoll Relative StrengthRelative Strength
1–3 Obscure group – few have heard of
them, no popular support
4–5 Fringe group – few supporters
6–7 Minor group – some supporters
8–9 Notable group – signifi cant support,
well known
10–11 Signifi cant – nearly as powerful as the
government
12 Overwhelming popular support – more
powerful than the government

Cultural Differences
While colonies trace their heritage back to their mother worlds and
patron governments, and from there to the ancient homeworlds
of the species, every world has a measure of unique cultural drift.
Spacefarers may run into bizarre customs or beliefs on different
worlds. The Referee should either decide how a culture has

developed over the centuries or roll on the table overleaf (or better
yet, both – a combination of reasoned extrapolation and random
strangeness produces a nicely organic-feeling culture).

LAW LEVEL
The law level of a planet represents the relative force of law extant on
the world. A high Law Level indicates that visitors to the world will
have their activities curtailed. Law Level determines two things in
particular – what it is illegal for characters to possess on the world,
and the likelihood that the characters will run afoul of the law.

Law level is determined by rolling 2d6–7 and adding the Government
characteristic. Compare this result to the Law Level table on page 176.

Banned Goods
Different governments ban different goods as indicated in the
'common contraband' column of the Government Table. A traveller
might be able to carry his laser rifle slung over his shoulder on one
world, and be arrested for carrying a lethal weapon on the next
planet over. An alien might enjoy full rights on one world, and be
treated as an animal on another. Banned goods are important for
smuggling (see page 162).

Weapons: Weapons: A government that bans weapons begins with restricting
weapons of terror and mass destruction, then moves onto personal
weapons.

Drugs: Drugs: A government that bans drugs begins with narcotics, but at
higher Law Levels, medicinal and anagathic drugs are also banned.

Information: Information: A government that seeks to control information
begins by restricting the use of computers and computer programs,
especially information-retrieval and information-control. At higher
Law Levels, bringing in data from offworld or even communicating
with natives is forbidden.

Imperium, and most worlds ban psionics as a matter of course. On
other worlds, psionics is technically legal, but there is such prejudice
against it that most psionic users hide their abilities.

The Law and Travellers
A planet's Law Level can be used to determine the characters'
interactions with the law. In each of the following situations, roll 2d6,
add the listed modifi ers, and if the total is lower than the planet's
Law Level, the characters are investigated or challenged by agents of
planetary law enforcement.

WORLD CREATION WORLD CREATION

Offworlders acting suspiciously –1 Check
Bar fi ght –1 Combat
Shots fi red –2 Combat
Breaking and entering –2 Investigate
Firefi ght involving armored characters
and military weapons

Murder and carnage –4 Investigate

Check Check means that the characters' travel documents and identities
are checked, either by a police offi cer or guard, or by electronically by
querying the characters' comms. A successful Admin or Streetwise
roll can allay suspicion but if this check is failed the planetary
authorities move on to Investigation.

Investigate Investigate means that a detective or bureaucrat probes deeper into
the characters' backgrounds. If the characters have a ship, it will
be searched. They may be followed, or have their communications
tapped. They may also be questioned closely.

Finally, CombatCombat means that the police show up ready for a fight.
Their response will generally be proportional to the threat posed by
the player characters; if the characters are just making trouble in a
bar, then most police forces will just use batons, stunners, tranq gas
and other non-lethal weapons. On the other hand, if the characters
are in Battle Dress and firing PGMPs at the palace of the planetary
duke, then the police will show up with the best weapons and armor
available at the planet's TL (or even a few levels higher).

Characters arrested for a crime will face punishment, determined
by rolling 2d6+DMs on the Sentencing table. For crimes involving
smuggling banned goods, the DM is equal to the difference
between the planet's law level and the banned goods in question.
(For example, laser weapons are banned at Law Level 2. A
character found with a laser weapon on a Law Level 6 world would
have a +4 DM to his roll on the Sentencing table.) Other crimes
have a set DM:

Assault Law level –5
Destruction of Property Law level –3
False Identity Law level –2
Manslaughter Law level –1
Murder Law level +0

A character with the Advocate skill may attempt to reduce the
severity of sentencing by making a check. If successful, reduce the
Sentencing DM by the Effect of the check.

Sentencing RollSentencing Roll SentenceSentence
0 or less Dismissed or trivial punishment
1–2 Fine of 1d6 1,000 credits

9–10 Imprisonment for 1d6 years or exile
11–12 Imprisonment for 2d6 years or exile
13–14 Life imprisonment
15+ Death

A result of Exile means that the character must leave the planet
immediately and never return. Fines for smuggling goods are
per tonof goods seized – gun running can be an extremely
risky proposition.

FactionalismFactionalism
Balkanised worlds or worlds with strong opposition to the planetary government can be unstable and dangerous places. One faction on the world
might call in aid from offworld – advanced technology can shift the balance from one side to another. Travellers might be employed to train or hunt
down revolutionaries, or help foster a social shift.

The factions...

1. ... are warring over a disputed election. If the characters can uncover evidence of fraud, they can resolve the dispute.
2. ... have their roots in cultural differences between the two. What is the origin of this dispute?
3. ... are actually fostering the dispute to keep the population in line with fear.
4. ... both try to hire the characters to fi ght against the other faction.
5. ... are both vying for Imperial support in their dispute.
6. ... are both being manipulated by a third party.

Imperial Rules of WImperial Rules of Warar
The rules of war are an accumulation of unwritten concepts established on a case-by-case basis. They have not been offi cially codifi ed to prevent formal precedent from
preventing Imperial intervention. The main aim of the rules is to maintain the economic and military well-being of the realm.

The Imperium tolerates the use of force as a necessary outlet for built-up political and social pressures beyond the opponents' ability to mediate. A short war is deemed
preferable to continuing tension, sabotage, political agitation, etc. However, attempts by extra-planetary forces to seize control of a world's affairs are beyond the scope of
the “safety valve” rationale. Recognizing that often some community of interest exists between a faction or state on a planet and some off-planet organization, the Imperium
tolerates 'assistance' as long as it is deemed appropriate to the level of legitimate interest in the affairs of the world held by the extraplanetary organization. When it has
appeared that the primary burden for the conduct of the war has been carried by an extra-planetary power, the Imperium has intervened.

One prohibition is clear and fi rm: use or possession of nuclear weapons, if discovered, and regardless of size or type, will almost certainly trigger Imperial intervention. The
Imperium alone retains the rights to such weapons, because of their extreme destructive powers and the relatively low tech level at which they can be manufactured.

For similar reasons, certain other weapons (chemical and bacteriological agents, and meson accelerators, for example) are strictly controlled, although they are not subject
to the sweeping restrictions placed on nuclear weapons.

12 Religious – culture is heavily influenced by a religion or belief
system, possibly one unique to this world.

42 Violent – physical conflict is common, taking the form of duels,
brawls or other contests. Trial by combat is a part of their
judicial system.
13 Artistic – art and culture are highly prized. Aesthetic design is
important in all artefacts produced onworld.

43 Peaceful – physical conflict is almost unheard-of. The culture
produces few soldiers and diplomacy reigns supreme. Forceful
characters will be ostracised.
14 Ritualised – social interaction and trade is highly formalised.
Politeness and adherence to traditional forms is considered
very important.

44 Obsessed – everyone is obsessed with or addicted to a
substance, personality, act or item. This monomania pervades
every aspect of the culture.
15 Conservative – the culture resists change and outside
influences.

45 Fashion – fi ne clothing and decoration are considered vitally
important in the culture. Underdressed characters have no
standing here.
16 Xenophobic – the culture distrusts outsiders and alien
influences. Offworlders will face considerable prejudice.

46 At war – the culture is at war, either with another planet or
polity, or is troubled by terrorists or rebels.
21 Ta b o o – a p a r t i c u l a r t o p i c i s f o r b i d d e n a n d c a n n o t b e
discussed. Characters who unwittingly mention this topic will
be ostracised.

51 Unusual Custom: Offworlders – space travellers hold a unique
position in the culture's mythology or beliefs, and travellers will
be expected to live up to these myths.
22 Deceptive – trickery and equivocation are considered acceptable.
Honesty is a sign of weakness.

52 Unusual Custom: Starport – the planet's starport is more than
a commercial center; it might be a religious temple, or be seen
as highly controversial and surrounded by protestors.
23 Liberal – the culture welcomes change and offworld influence.
Characters who bring new and strange ideas will be welcomed.

53 Unusual Custom: Media – news agencies and
telecommunications channels are especially strange here.
Getting accurate information may be diffi cult.
24 Honorable – one's word is one's bond in the culture. Lying is
both rare and despised.

54 Unusual Customs: Technology – the culture interacts with
technology in an unusual way. Telecommunications might
be banned, robots might have civil rights, cyborgs might be
property.
25 Infl uenced – the culture is heavily infl uenced by another,
neighboring world. If you have the details for the neighboring
world, choose a cultural quirk that this world has adopted. If
not, roll for one.

55 Unusual Customs: Lifecycle – there might be a mandatory age
of termination, or anagathics might be widely used. Family
units might be different, with children being raised by the state
or banned in favor of cloning.
26 Fusion – the culture is a merger of two distinct cultures. Roll
again twice to determine the quirks inherited from these
cultures. If the quirks are incompatible then the culture is likely
divided.

56 Unusual Customs: Social Standings – the culture has a distinct
caste system. Characters of a low social standing who do not
behave appropriately will face punishment.

31 Barbaric – physical strength and combat prowess are highly
valued in the culture. Characters may be challenged to a fight,
or dismissed if they seem incapable of defending themselves.
Sports tend towards the bloody and violent.

61 Unusual Customs: Trade – the culture has an odd attitude
towards some aspect of commerce, which may interfere with
trade at the spaceport. For example, merchants might expect
a gift as part of a deal, or some goods may only be handled by
certain families.
32 Remnant – the culture is a surviving remnant of a once-great
and vibrant civilization, clinging to its former glory. The world
is fi lled with crumbling ruins, and every story revolves around
the good old days.

62 Unusual Customs: Nobility – those of high social standing
have a strange custom associated with them; perhaps nobles
are blinded, or must live in gilded cages, or only serve for a
single year before being exiled.
33 Degenerate – the culture is falling apart and is on the brink of
war or economic collapse. Violent protests are common and
the social order is decaying.

63 Unusual Customs: Sex – the culture has an unusual attitude
towards intercourse and reproduction. Perhaps cloning is used
instead, or sex is used to seal commercial deals.
34 Progressive – the culture is expanding and vibrant. Fortunes
are being made in trade; science is forging bravely ahead.

64 Unusual Customs: Eating – food and drink occupies an
unusual place in the culture. Perhaps eating is a private affair,
or banquets and formal dinners are seen as the highest form
of politeness.
35 Recovering – a recent trauma, such as a plague, war, disaster or
despotic regime has left scars on the culture.

65 Unusual Customs: Travel – travellers may be distrusted or feted,
or perhaps the culture frowns on those who leave their homes.
36 Nexus – members of many different cultures and species visit
here.

66 Unusual Custom: Conspiracy – something strange is going
on. The government is being subverted by another group or
agency.

WORLD CREATION WORLD CREATION

STARPORT
Starports are the arteries of interstellar commerce. These ports for
spacefaring craft range in size from a landing fi eld with a rudimentary
radio beacon and a hydrogen fuel still to city-sized edifi ces where
tens of thousands of ships land daily. Most planets have only a
DownPort, a landing zone on the ground accessible only by entering
the atmosphere. Ships that cannot land at a DownPort are serviced
by a fleet of shuttles and other smaller vessels. Worlds advanced or
rich enough may possess a HighPort, an orbiting starport. Some
are equipped with space elevators or even gravitic lifts connecting
HighPort to DownPort.

Starports are rated from A to E. To determine the level of a starport
on a planet, roll 2d6:

jurisdiction of the planetary government. The local government may
share in the construction costs, running costs and profits of the
starport, but the port is extraterritorial and run by an Imperium-
appointed governor. This means that travellers can carry locally
illegal goods onto a planet as long as they do not leave the starport.

The qualityquality of a starport determines both the condition of the port
itself, and the level of competence of the staff. Quality may vary
up and down – it is possible to fi nd a Class-D port run by expert
engineers, or a Class-A that has succumbed to decay. Some
worlds have entirely inappropriate starports; a world that was
once a center of commerce, but has now been bypassed by new
trade routes might have a cavernous port capable of handling
thousands of freighters, but is now almost abandoned.

A frontier installation is just a bare spot of bedrock, marked with a
beacon, and is a starport in the most technical sense only.

The berthing costberthing cost must be paid by any starship that wants to land
at or dock with the starport. Costs can vary wildly from starport to
starport but remain more or less constant at each port (roll once
for each port and record it for future reference).

Fuel Fuel refers to the fuel available for purchase – either refi ned or
unrefi ned. Refi ned fuel costs Cr. 500 per ton; unrefi ned fuel costs
Cr. 100 per ton but is risky to use when jumping (see page 140).
Bases have their own fuel-refi ning ability – see Bases, below.

Facilities Facilities are the starport's repair and construction ability. A
shipyard allows for the construction of new vessels. A shipyard
capable of building all types of ships can construct small craft (less
than 100 tons), spacecraft (100 to 5,000 tons) and capital ships
(more than 5,000 tons).

RepairRepair facilities allow a damaged ship to be repaired, and have
plenty of spare parts for most common systems. Limited repair
facilities can only fi x Hull hits but not system damage.

Finally, the Bases Bases column lists what sort of bases may be present.
Roll 2d6 for each base type listed; if you roll the indicated number
or higher, that base is present either as part of the starport or
nearby. For more details, see Bases, page 179.

It also means that criminals and refugees often claim sanctuary in a
starport, and that a starport's technology level may be considerably
higher than the rest of the planet. Starports operate according to
Imperial law (equivalent to Law Level 1 for most items, and Law
Level 7 for psionics).

The Technology Level measures the average technology presence
on the planet, and gives an idea of local production and repair
capability. Trade with offworlders may bring in advanced technology;
on average, a rich individual can afford technology two or more
levels higher than the planetary average. The government may also
have access to higher-technology items.

A planet's technology may be one or more levels higher or lower in
a particular fi eld, such as Medicine, Communications, Weaponry,
Ship Construction, Power Generation, Computers and so forth.

Communications
If the planet is below Technology Level 3 then there is no
telecommunication system whatsoever except for whatever
facilities the starport offers. If it is between TL 4 and TL 6 then it
has radio and telephone communications between major cities
at least, but no satellite facilities. From TL 7 onwards, the planet
has a progressively more advanced communications grid with only
occasional gaps. At TL 9, it is accessible from every point of the
surface (communications satellites are cheap and easy to deploy).

BASES
In addition to the basic facilities at a starport, there may be one
or more special Imperial bases at the starport or nearby in the
system. There are six common types of bases, but others are also
possible, such as prison facilities, naval shipyards, alien embassies
or consulates and other secret operations.

Naval: Naval: A naval base is a supply depot, refuelling station, repair
yard or fortress of either the Imperial Navy or the local sector
navy. Naval vessels can obtain refi ned fuel and supplies here.
Naval bases are always guarded by armed vessels and fixed
defences. Ex-navy characters may meet contacts or allies here,
and mercenary characters can try to pick up work. Naval bases
also have an advanced hospital although it is normally available
only to naval personnel. Characters may also be able to purchase
navy-surplus weapons here.

Scout: Scout: A scout base offers refined fuel and supplies to scout ships
(including retired scout ships obtained by retired scouts). They are
also an excellent place to pick up rumors and news.

Environmental Limits
Certain atmospheres require a minimal Technology Level. A
world can have a Technology Level lower than this limit, but
the population cannot maintain or repair their life support
systems and are likely doomed when the inevitable mechanical
failure happens.

TAS: TAS: This is a Traveller's Aid Society Hostel, where characters
with TAS membership and their guests can stay. TAS Hostels offer
medical facilities for members, as well as supplies and luxuries not
normally available on most worlds. TAS Hostels are a good source
of rumors and passengers.

Research: Research: A Research base is dedicated to a particular field of
research. The base might be a weapons testing facility, or a solar

observatory, or part of a secret Imperial project. A research base
may have connections or allies of scholar characters. Such bases
may have advanced medical facilities if that is their fi eld.

Imperial Consulate: Imperial Consulate: An Imperial consulate is an administration
offi ce for various imperial departments such as commerce, justice
and foreign affairs. Characters wishing to report significant crimes
or obtain various permits will need to visit a consulate.

Pirate: Pirate: The presence of a pirate base in a system indicates that
a group of thieves is active in the area. Pirates are unlikely to be
operating out of the starport itself (except on a Law Level 0 world),
but no doubt have agents at the port on the look-out for likely prey.
Ex-rogues may know of pirate bases.

TRAVEL CODES
There are two travel codes – Amber and Red. An Amber world has
been deemed dangerous by the Imperium, and travellers are warned
to be on their guard. Amber worlds are often undergoing upheaval
or revolution, or else are naturally hazardous environments.

Red worlds are interdicted and travel to them is forbidden. A world
might be Red because the Imperium wishes to preserve it, or
because the world is too dangerous to allow visitors. Interdictions
are enforced by the Imperial Navy.

A world with an Atmosphere of 10+, a government of 0, 7 or 10, or
a Law Level of 0 or 9+ should be considered for Amber status. Red
codes are given out at the discretion of the Referee.

Variations
The preceding world creation system is geared towards the
default Tr a v e l l e r setting of the Third Imperium. Interstellar
empires are centrally planned and locally managed, travel
between worlds takes days rather than minutes or years, and
life is everywhere with just enough intelligent alien species
to be interesting.

However, there are two other common milieus for science
fiction roleplaying: 'space opera' and 'hard science'. Space opera
campaigns tend to focus on fewer key worlds and so randomly
generated worlds are less likely to be habitable. Hard science
campaigns tend to require a rugged individuality and a frontier
spirit; slower travel times bleed over to require more generally
self-suffi cient worlds. In hard science settings, starports are
typically built, owned and operated by the host world rather than
some central governing power.

SPACE OPERA WORLD CREATION
When generating a mainworld for a space opera setting, generate
Size and Atmosphere as normal then consult the following if
Size is 4 or less:

- If Size is 0–2, Atmosphere is set to 0. The world is too small
    to retain an atmosphere.
- If Size is 3–4 and Atmopshere is 0–2, set Atmosphere to 0.
- If Size is 3–4 and Atmosphere is 3–5, set Atmosphere to 1.
- If Size is 3–4 and Atmopshere is 6+, set Atmosphere to A.

Hydrographics is also affected. Apply the following DMs to rolls
on the Hydrographics Table (page 172):

- If Size is 3–4 and Atmosphere is A the DM is –6.
- If Atmosphere is 0–1 the DM is –6.
- If Atmosphere is 2–3, B or C the DM is –4.

HARD SCIENCE WORLD CREATION
Hard science worlds use the space opera modifiers above, plus
additional Dice Modifiers to Population based on the Size and
Atmosphere as follows:

- If Size is 0–2 (low gravity world) then the DM is –1.
- If Size is A (high gravity world) then the DM is –1.
- If Atmosphere is not 5, 6 or 8 then the DM is –1.
- If Atmosphere is 5, 6 or 8 then the DM is +1.

In addition, the population of a world has an affect on the class
of the local starport. Instead of rolling 2d6 on the Starport Table,
roll 2d6–7 and add the Population value.
