(C674321 - 8). Tionale is the first world in its star system, orbiting the binary stars, of Tionale major and Tionale minor a main M-star with a smaller M-star companion. It is a medium-sized world, having a standard atmosphere with a chemical taint which induces giddiness and loss of coordination and mental control in unprotected individuals (visitors require a filter mask or filter plugs), and significant water coverage (approximately 40%). Tionale is a low population, tropical world with an indigenous intelligent species, referred to as Sixes, inhabiting the planet alongside the fewer than 10000 colonists. The planetary government is a participatory democracy embracing all citizens aged 25 or greater. All major policy decisions are made by direct vote in popular assemblies held at D’unsin, the only major settlement on the planet, four times a year.

Tionale has a Class C Starport, an average quality installation which includes amenities including unrefined fuel for starships, some brokerage services for passengers and cargo, and a variety of ship provisions. There is a shipyard capable of doing maintenance and other kinds of repair.

Due to the continual hostilities between the colonists and the indigenous population, which started in 1103 with attacks on outlying farmsteads but has escalated over the years, Tionale is designated an [[Amber Zone]] by the Travellers’ Aid Society.

# Environment

[[Tionale]] is classified as a tropical world. It has large areas of forestation which would be classified as tropical rain forest, bordered by grasslands and swamp terrain. The rain forests are characterized by a closed, and continuous tree canopy, a high level of moisture-dependent vegetation, and the presence of epiphytes (plants that grow on the surface of other plants) and lianas (long-stemmed, woody vines that are rooted in the soil at ground level and uses trees, as well as other means of vertical support, to climb up to the canopy in search of direct sunlight).

As with most tropical rainforest, the ones on [[Tionale]] have a number of layers, each with different plants and animals adapted for life in that particular area.

The emergent layer contains a small number of very large trees called emergents, which grow above the general canopy, reaching heights of 55 – 65 m, although on occasion a few species will grow to 90 – 100 m tall. These trees need to be able to withstand the hot temperatures and strong winds that occur above the canopy in some areas. Large-winged birds of prey, brightly colored winged insects, small nocturnal flighted mammalian creatures, and certain small simian-like creatures are known to inhabit this layer.

The canopy layer contains the majority of the largest trees, typically 40m to 55m tall. The densest areas of biodiversity are found in the forest canopy, a more or less continuous cover of foliage formed by adjacent treetops. The colony scientists have estimated that the canopy of the rain forests is home to 60 percent of all plant species on Tionale. Epiphytic plants attach to trunks and branches, and obtain water and minerals from rain and debris that collects on the supporting plants. The fauna is similar to that found in the emergent layer but more diverse. The scientific evidence indicates that approximately 30% of all Tionale insect life exists in the rainforest canopy.

The understory, or understorey, layer lies between the canopy and the forest floor. It is home to a number of avians, ophidians and reptiles, as well as predatorial creatures. The leaves are much larger at this level and insect life is abundant. Many seedlings that will grow to the canopy level are present in the understory. Only about 10 percent of the sunlight shining on the rainforest canopy reaches the understory, making for a constant twilight state.

The forest floor of the Tionale rain forest, the bottom-most layer, receives roughly 5 percent of the normal level of sunlight, effectively making it a constant night-time state. Only plants adapted to low light can grow in this region. Away from riverbanks, swamps and clearings, where dense undergrowth is found, the forest floor is relatively clear of vegetation because of the low level of sunlight penetration. It also contains decaying plant and animal matter, which disappears quickly, because the warm, humid conditions promote rapid decay. Many forms of fungi growing here help decay the animal and plant waste.

## Encounters

#### Aryint Swarm

![[MofT-6244.jpg|200]]
[[MofT-6244.jpg|Aryint Swarm]]
A creature native to Tionale, they spend the majority of their time foraging for food. Normally encountered in a swarm (1000+ Aryint will be present but are treated as a single organism for purposes of combat), Aryint are small, insectoid creatures that eat everything in their path, in a similar manner to Terran army ants.

The adventurers will either need to flee from the swarm ( **_roll 7+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Educ 8+, +1 ex-Army or ex-Marine or ex-Scout - takes four hours of travel time and need to roll to avoid losing the trail_** ) or change the direction that the swarm is moving in
( **_roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Educ 8+, +1 ex-Army or ex-Marine or ex-Scout - takes two hours of time and need to roll to reacquire the trail with a +2 bonus_** ).

Alternatively, the adventurers can “attack” the swarm. If the adventurers do sufficient damage to render the swarm “unconscious”, they manage to cause the swarm to divert its course away from their route.

(Aryint - eaters (a swarm counts as a single creature for purposes of combat), 1kg, 100/50, cloth+2, 7, teeth, A 5, F 10, S 3)

#### Cherimpen

A creature native to Tionale. It spends most of its time foraging for food. Normally encountered in small family groups (2D-1 Cherimpen will be present), Cherimpen are small, bipedal creatures that use their clawed forepaws to assist them in moving quickly over the uneven jungle floor, or to help propel them through the understory of the jungle canopy.

Timid in nature, cherimpen will generally flee from potential threats. If cornered, or protecting their young, however, they can become vicious and will attack.
(Cherimpen - gatherer, 20kg, 8/4, none, 3, claws, A 8, F 6, S 2)

#### Dense Mist

A thick mist, caused by the humidity within the Tionale jungle, shrouds the jungle floor. Visibility is reduced to 5 meters. The adventurers can wait for the mist to clear, which will take 1D hours, or they can attempt to continue to pursue the thieves. If the adventurers choose to continue tracking the thieves, the dense mist makes it more difficult to find the trail ( DM +4 to tracking rolls while the mist persists ). Additionally, the adventurers could injury themselves, or damage their vehicles, while travelling through the mist ( roll 7+; DM +1 Dex 9+, +1 Intel 9+, +1 Vehicle-1, +1 ex-Army or ex-Marine or ex-Scout - failure results in one of the adventurers suffering a minor injury (1d damage) or one of the vehicles suffering minor damage which needs immediate fixing - roll 6+; DM +1 Intel 8+, +1 Mechanical- 1 ).

#### Jeraygar

A creature native to Tionale. They stalk their prey and spring upon from hiding. Jeraygar are solitary hunters, resembling a jaguar. The jeraygar will track the adventurers for 1D hours, awaiting an opportunity to attack. Its natural camouflage makes it very difficult to spot. Adventurers can check to see if they spot the jeraygar once for each hour that it tracks them ( roll 10+; DM +1 Intel 9+, + ex-Army or ex-Marine or ex-Scout ). The jeraygar will attack if the opportunity arises to do so during the time that it is tracking the adventurers ( roll 9+ for an opportunity to present itself for the jeraygar to attack ). If the jeraygar is spotted and the adventurers attack it, its response actions are given in its stats.

(Jeraygar - pouncer, 40kg, 16/9, cloth, 4, claws, A 6, F 9, S 4)

#### Kryztalhead Snake

A creature native to Tionale.  Kryztalhead snakes are solitary hunters, usually concealing themselves in the undergrowth of the jungle floor, or hiding on low-lying branches of the understory.

Given the opportunity, a kryztalhead snake will strike at its prey ( **_roll 8+ to hit_** ), injecting its target with its potentially lethal venom ( **_roll 7+; DM +1 Str 8+, + End 9+, - failure results in 2D damage and roll needs to be repeated after one minute, success means the body has managed to resist the venom_** ).

Any adventurer that is bitten might notice that they have been bitten ( **_roll 8+; DM +1 Intel 8+, +1 Educ 9+, +1 ex-Army or ex-Marine, +2 ex-Scout_** ). If an adventure does notice they bite, they can inject themselves with a wide-spectrum anti-venom (if they have any) ( **_DM +3 to resist the venom_** ).

Adventurers may spot the kryztalhead snake before it strikes ( **_roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 ex-Army or ex-Marine or ex-Scout_** ).

If the kryztalhead snake is spotted and the adventurers attack it, its response actions are given in its stats.

(Kryztalhead Snake - pouncer, 2kg, 4/1, jack+1, 2 + venom, teeth, A 7, F 6, S 3)

#### Quagmire

A large section of the ground in this area of the jungle floor is waterlogged. If the adventurers try to traverse the ground they will sink into it.

Adventurers can check to see if they spot the treacherous terrain before they continue ( **_roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 8+, +1 Educ-9+, +1 ex-Army or ex-Marine, +2 ex-Scout_** ). If they spot the problem, the adventurers can either travel around the quagmire (this takes three hours) or they can take two hours and attempt to find a safe place to cross ( **_roll 8+; DM +1 Intel 8+, +1 Educ-9+, +1 ex-Army or ex-Marine, +2 ex-Scout - the adventurers find a dry ford through the quagmire_** ).

If the adventurers proceed without spotting the quagmire or decide to proceed without finding an alternate route/safe place, then they will find themselves being pulled under by the ground ( **_roll 10+ to resist for each ten minutes in the quagmire; DM +1 Str A+, +1 End A+ - vehicles do not get to roll to resist_** ). Crossing the quagmire takes one hour.

If the adventurers are pulled down, they can attempt to escape ( roll 8+; DM +1 Str 9+, +1 End 9+, +1 for assistance from other adventurers - a failed attempt to escape means the adventurer remains under the ground and can retry in one minute ). If an adventurer does not escape they need to check if they can hold their breath ( roll 7+; DM +1 End 8+, + End A+ - failure results in 1D damage from suffocation, each failed escape attempt increases the difficulty by 1 ).  If an adventurer is wearing a respirator they do not need to check if they can hold their breath.

Each time an adventurer is pulled under, and escapes, they need to check each piece of carried equipment as it may be lost in the quagmire ( roll 8+ to retain equipment; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 ex-Army or ex-Marine, +2 ex-Scout ). Equipment lost this way is irretrievable.

Vehicles pulled under can be retrieved with great effort ( roll 9+; DM +1 Str A+, +1 End A+, +1 ex-Army or ex-Marine or ex-Scout, +1 for multiple adventurers involved ). Check for loss of equipment on the vehicle in the same way as for an adventurer that escapes the quagmire.

#### Trapper Vines

The vines in this area of the jungle are a living organism that will attempt to ensnare the adventurers.

Adventurers can check to see if they spot the hazardous vines before they continue ( **_roll 8+; DM + Intel 8+, +1 Educ-9+, +1 ex-Army or ex-Marine, +2 ex- Scout_** ). If they spot the problem, the adventurers can either travel around the vines (this takes one hour) or they can attempt to remove the vines from their path.

If the adventurers fail to spot the vines, then they will find themselves under attack by surprise when they proceed.

The vines will attempt to grab and hold individuals in a constrictive grip, inflicting 1D wounds per combat round. Adventurers that are caught can attempt to break free ( **_roll 8+; DM +1 Str 9+, +1 for assistance from others, +1 per point damage caused to the vines_** ).

(Trapper Vines - trapper, 200kg, 16/6, cloth+1, 1D, constricting vines, A surprise, F -, S 0)

D’unsin Starport, which was upgraded from D to C-class in 1096 (including the construction of a Highport) with Imperial financial and technical assistance, is the real linchpin of the planetary economy. It has become a key stopping place for merchants plying the [[Spinward Main]], and Tionale’s low law level, autonomous status, and location directly between the Imperium and the Demilitarized Independent Region, have also made it a haven for smugglers and corsairs. Indeed, starport personnel are famous for their willingness to ignore suspicious cargoes and overlook inconsistencies in ships’ papers. The starport’s repair yards are kept very busy and it is not unusual for all thirteen dirtside and five orbital repair bays (for ships of up to 1,000 tons) to be in use at any given time, necessitating a wait of several weeks by prospective customers. The starport is operated by the governing Council, so there is no extrality zone.

# Library Data

Tionale (C674321 - 8) is an Imperial Client system perched at the coreward end of the Vilis Subsector. It is the first world in its star system, orbiting the binary stars, of Tionale major and Tionale minor a main M-star with a smaller M-star companion. It is a medium-sized world, having a standard atmosphere with a chemical taint, and significant water coverage
(approximately 40%). Tionale is a low population, tropical world with an indigenous intelligent species, referred to as Sixes, inhabiting the planet alongside the fewer than 10000 colonists.

Due to its tainted atmosphere and lack of readily-exploitable resources, the planet was settled much later than most of its neighbors. Indeed, it was only in 1088 that 3,000 colonists -- mostly drawn from Regina (Spinward Marches) -- first took up residence on Tionale.

Tionale’s atmosphere contains a chemical taint which induces giddiness and loss of coordination and mental control in unprotected sophonts -- followed by unconsciousness and possibly even death if the exposure is prolonged. The residents accordingly live in structures provided with overpressure or filtration systems, and must wear individual protection when out of doors. Due to the dehumanizing appearance of traditional filter masks, most colonists prefer to use filter plugs inserted in the nostrils. Besides causing a marked (and often comical) alteration in one’s voice, users must be careful not to inhale through the mouth, even when speaking. By force of habit, long-time residents have no difficulty doing this, but the
"drunken" antics of less-practiced off-worlders provide an endless source of amusement for them. In 1101, a terraforming project began with the objective of reducing the atmospheric taint to non-irritant levels within 30 standard years. With funding provided in part by Imperial developmental grants, a large, fusion-powered air ‘scrubbing’ plant was constructed on the fringe of the colonized region.

Tionale has a Class C Starport, an average quality installation which includes amenities including unrefined fuel for starships, some brokerage services for passengers and cargo, and a variety of ship provisions. There is a shipyard capable of doing maintenance and other kinds of repair. Ports of this classification generally have only a downport, unless this is a trade port or system with an hostile environment main world. D’unsin Starport, which was upgraded from D to C-class in 1096 (including the construction of a Highport) with Imperial financial and technical assistance, is the real linchpin of the planetary economy. It has become a key stopping place for merchants plying the Spinward Main, and Tionale’s low law level, autonomous status, and location directly between the Imperium and the Demilitarized Independent Region (DIR) have also made it a haven for smugglers and corsairs. Indeed, starport personnel are famous for their willingness to ignore suspicious cargoes and overlook inconsistencies in ships’ papers. The starport’s repair yards are kept very busy and it is not unusual for all thirteen dirtside and five orbital repair bays (for ships of up to 1,000 tons) to be in use at any given time, necessitating a wait of several weeks by prospective customers. The starport is operated by the governing Council, so there is no extrality zone. The planetary government is a participatory democracy embracing all citizens aged 25 or greater. All major policy decisions are made by direct vote in popular assemblies held at D’unsin four times a year. Since at least 70% of the electorate is typically in attendance, all other activity grinds to a halt on such occasions. Day-to-day governance is handled by a Council whose nine members are elected and removed by a simple majority vote. Its functions are limited to managing the starport, operating modest public utilities and health facilities, and collecting minimal taxes. Since crime is rare outside of D’unsin Starport, there are barely a dozen law enforcement officers on Tionale. Crime among visiting ship crews is generally seen as an affair to be settled by the off-worlders themselves and will rarely draw official attention unless it threatens citizens of Tionale or their property.
