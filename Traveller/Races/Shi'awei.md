### Shi'awei

The Shi'awei are native to [[Chaosheo]]. They are an aquatic people adapted to life in deep water and have little contact with outsiders. Their society is highly fragmented, with cultures varying enormously from one group to another. Some communities are friendly, others likely to kill and eat anyone who attempts to visit them.  It is not known if this hostility is innate or somehow triggered, nor if the culture of a group varies over time.  There are records of contact with groups of Shi'awei in the same locality turning out very differently each time, although it is not clear if this was the same community.

Some groups of Shi'awei interact with non-native communities set-up on what little land Chaosheo possesses but significant difficulties exist even here.  Most have access only to the most basic metalworking, using heat from geothermal vents.

The Shi'awei have a bullet-shaped body with four arms evenly spaced around the torso and fins at the tail. Two of their arms have grippers capable of exerting great pressure; the other two are used for fine manipulation.

#### Creating Shi'awei Travellers
The Shi'awei body has an internal bone skeleton, lymph-like circulatory fluid and is covered by a waterproof skin. There are two genders, with the female slightly more numerous than males.
Males tend to have slightly lower strength but greater endurance. Both possess sonar and have excellent chemical receptors and touch sensitivity, communicating with consonantal clicks, which transmit well under water.
