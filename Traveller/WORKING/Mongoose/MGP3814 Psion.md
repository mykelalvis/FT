WHAT ELSE IS



NEEDED?
Only the Traveller Core Rulebook is a
necessary adjunct to Psion. Mercenary and
High Guard may prove useful but are by no
means essential.

### IINTRODUCTIONNTRODUCTION

This book focuses on psions and psionics. It is intended for both
players and Referees and explores, in depth, psionic potential,
powers, careers, campaigns, equipment and special rules and
circumstances that need to be considered when psions are used in
Traveller games.

It is a generic book, in that the rules are designed to fit any number
of science fiction campaign styles: hard SF, space opera, science
fantasy, anime, comic book recreations and so on. The rules are
flexible and therefore offer a toolkit for Referees to use in building
psionics that fit the feel and theme of their campaign. The rules also
offer players a wealth of information useful for designing, developing
and running psion characters.

The _Traveller_ core rules are needed to get the most from Psions but
you will find the core psionics rules from _Traveller_ reproduced here
for general convenience. The rest of the book expands and develops
those rules, adding a plethora of new talents, powers, options and
other considerations.

The book's structure is as follows:

Chapter 1: Defining Psionics
The basic psionics rules, plus an
exploration of what psionics
are and how they fit into
different types of campaigns

Chapter 2: Doors of

Perception
Testing for psionics and developing psionic
talents. This chapter also begins the rules
expansion in earnest.

Ordinarily, acquiring information is done through the five senses
of hearing, smell, taste, sight and touch. Likewise, performing
physical actions is done through the seen, physical manipulation of
the material world in ways that everyone can understand. These are
_conventional, normal_ activities.

Psionics or psionic power, is the ability to acquire information and
affect physical actions using the power of the mind. Psionics are
extrasensory in that they often bypass the traditional five senses as a
channel of entry for information (and imparting it). In societies where
scientific understanding of psionic phenomena and powers is limited
or non-existent, psionics are often labelled as magic, witchcraft,
sorcery, miracles or devilry. Those who are psionically gifted may
be viewed as witches, witch-doctors, victims of possession, insane
practitioners of evil or even prophets, saviours and messiahs. This is
generally the level of understanding found in Tech Level 4 societies
and below; at Tech Level 5, serious scientific research into psionics
starts. At Tech Level 6 and above, psionics are acknowledged as a

### DDEFININGEFINING P PSIONICSSIONICS

genuine force, with a scientific (as opposed to a superstitious) basis,
even if the full concepts of psionics are not fully understood. The
Psionics Tech Level table provides a general quantification of how
psionics are likely to be viewed in society – although low Tech Level
societies may well be enlightened enough to accept and appreciate
the powers of the mind to the extent that they are not considered to
be magical or divine powers and emanate from within.

This table is provided only as a general guide for how psionics
might develop in Traveller campaigns. Advancements may occur
earlier or later, depending on the type of campaign genre being
played. Ultimately the Referee needs to decide the level of psionic
development, although this book provides some guidance on how
different campaign genres treat psionic abilities.

For example, in the universe of the Third Imperium a few humans

_- and other sophonts – have developed potent psionic abilities such as
telepathy, telekinesis and even teleportation. In the Imperium, learning_

PSIONICS TECH LEVEL



Tech Level TL Definition Psionic Understanding and Development
0 Primitive Psionics are viewed as gifts from the gods – or devils and demons.
1 Psionics are viewed as magical or sorcerous powers.
2 Psionics are viewed as witchcraft; opposed to advances in learning and scientific endeavor.
3 Psionics are viewed as a form of supernatural science, with the first scientific-based explorations of
clairvoyance, telekinesis and telepathy.
4 Industrial An acceptance that the mind can be used in ways beyond current scientific understanding but
5 accompanied by continued social scepticism.
6 Scientific endeavor begins to prove the existence of psionic powers and to develop the means of
7 Pre-Stellar identifying those with psionic potential.
8 Psionic training begins, allowing the first, widely accepted demonstrations of psionic ability. Basic
psionic talents are understood and can be actively developed in controlled environments to maximise
potential.
9 Trained psions find acceptance to some degree in society, with psionics becoming integrated into
10 Early Stellar commerce, industry and the military.
11 Psionic study and understanding helps develop artificial intelligence. Psionically-powered devices
become available, as do devices for enhancing (and restricting) psionic powers.
12 Average Stellar Advanced psionic talents are understood, trained and developed.
13 Basic psionic talents and powers replace certain conventional techniques, skills and practices in
everyday life. Advanced talents and powers are optimized.
14 Advanced psionic talents and powers replace certain conventional techniques, skills and practices in
everyday life. Higher states of being (Transcendence or Sublimation) are examined for the first time.
Psionically-powered starships are developed.
15 High Stellar Inter-dimensional travel and manipulation is understood and may be achieved, depending on approach
and maturity of the society. Both basic and advanced psionic talents may also be the norm within
society, rather than the exception.
16+ Transcendent The society is either on the verge of or capable of, transcending the constraints of physical existence
altogether. Inter-dimensional travel is not only possible but practiced. The need for traditional
starship drives become redundant as advanced psionic talents permit far more efficient, sometimes
instantaneous, forms of travel.

_to harness this gift is a difficult process, made even harder by the Imperial
ban on psionics. The psionics institutes that study mental powers have
gone underground, following a disastrous attempt to guide human
development centuries ago. In other civilizations, such as the Zhodani
Consulate, psionics are an accepted part of the human condition._

CORE PSIONIC RULES


Psionics are powered by the Psionic Strength characteristic (abbreviation Psi). This characteristic cannot be rolled or bought
during character creation without the Referee's permission. To
determine a character's Psionic Strength, roll 2d6 and subtract
the number of terms served by the character in any career (Psionic
Strength diminishes over time unless actively used). For example,
a 38 year old character (five terms served) would roll 2d6–5 to
determine his Psionic Strength. A character with a Psionic Strength
of 0 has no potential for psionic powers.

Using a psionic talent costs a number of Psionic Strength points,
temporarily reducing the character's total. As the Characteristic DM
for all Psionic skill checks is determined by the characters' current
Psionic Strength total, it gets harder and harder to use powers as
the character's strength declines.

Recovering Psionic Strength Points: Expended Psionic Strength
points are recovered at the rate of one point per hour, beginning
three hours after the character last used a psionic talent.

Campaign Level and Psi Points
Campaigns that have a heavy emphasis on psionics or where
advanced talents are used regularly, may find that the method of
calculating Psi offers too low a pool of Psi Strength to cope with the
campaign or genre's demands.

Referees may therefore increase the Psi characteristic if they so
wish. Determine the Psionic Strength as per above and then apply a
modifier to the base rating to increase the Psi characteristics. Some
suggestions are:

Campaign/Genre Type Example

Psionic Strength
Modifier
Traditional SF Third Imperium Base Psi
Psi-heavy, hard SF
campaigns

Babylon 5 Psi + Int DM

Space Opera; Anime Hammer's
Slammers

Psi x 1.

Science Fantasy; Comic
Book

Judge Dredd,
Strontium Dog

Psi x 2

Transcendent Cultures
SF



Dune, The Culture Psi x 2.

When applying a multiplier as the modifier, always round up. For
example, a psionically trained super-soldier in a Hammer's Slammers
type game has a base Psi of 7. Applying the modifier of x1.5 would give a
Psi Strength of 7+3.5, rounded to 4 – so 11.

TESTING FOR PSIONICS –

BASIC PROCEDURE


The basic procedure for testing for psionic ability is presented here
and is identical to that found in the Traveller Core Rulebook. More
detailed options are provided in the next chapter but for a quick start
for psion characters, the basic procedure is fine.

Any character who wishes to develop psionic abilities requires
training. In settings where psionics are uncommon or illegal
he must find a teacher. Finding such an instructor may be an
adventure in itself. Most teachers will charge at least Cr. 5,000 to
test the character's abilities. Testing takes two weeks. The first step
is testing a character's Psionic Strength, which is determined as
described above (2d6 – number of terms served, plus any modifiers
for campaign type). If the character still has any Psionic Strength
remaining, he can be trained. Training requires four months of
work and costs Cr. 100,000, if the character is funding the training
himself. If the character is discovered by a psionics development
program or a teacher seeking an apprentice, then training costs
may be lower, negligible or nil – depending on campaign demands.
As part of training, the character may attempt to learn any of the
common psionic talents on the Common Psionic Talents table by
making a Psionic Strength check. He may attempt the talents in any
order but suffers a –1 DM per check attempted. If a character learns
a talent, he gains that talent at level 0.

COMMON PSIONIC TALENTS


Talent Learning DM
Telepathy +
Clairvoyance +
Telekinesis +
Awareness +
Teleportation 0

For example, Luka has just determined that she has a Psionic Strength
of 9. She now rolls to determine powers. She can select powers in any
order, so she begins with telekinesis. She roll 2d6+1 (her Psionic Strength
DM) +2 (the Telekinesis learning DM) but unfortunately, the dice roll
is a 3 for a total of 6 – less than eight, a failure and so she does not
develop telekinesis. Next, she tries telepathy. She rolls 2d6 +1 (her
Psionic Strength DM) +4 (the telepathy learning DM) –1 (one previous
talent acquisition check) and gets a total of 10. Luka gains Telepathy
at level 0.

DEFINING PSIONICS DDEFININGEFINING P PSIONICSSIONICS



BASIC PSIONIC TALENTS


There are several basic psionic talents; each of which works like
a skill for the powers in question. A character trained in the use
of psionics may develop his talents over time just as if they were
normal skills. Unlike other skills, psionic talents cannot be used
untrained. The most common talents are:

- Telepathy – reading minds and mental communication.
- Clairvoyance – perceiving at a distance.
- Telekinesis – mind over matter.
- Awareness – control over one's own mind and body.
- Teleportation – moving from one point to another instantly.

Each talent grants access to all of its powers – a character with Telepathy 0 can
use life detection , read surface thoughts or assault as the situation demands.

ADVANCED PSIONIC TALENTS


This book introduces several new advanced talents that include
extended groups of powers. These advanced talents are designed to

introduce psionic abilities that go several stages beyond those given
in this chapter and are designed to reflect the kinds and ranges of
powers found in different forms of science fiction: space opera,
science fantasy, comic book and so on.

Learning an Advanced talent depends on whether or not the talent
is permissible in the campaign. If it is, then it is subject to a learning
DM in the same manner as basic talents.

- Aura Perception – reading and manipulating psychic auras.
- Dimensional Manipulation – manipulating and travelling
    between parallel dimensions.
- Energy Kinesis – manipulating and controlling different forms
    of energy: electricity, light and heat.
- Machine Symbiosis – manipulating and controlling machinery.
- Personal Enhancement – using psionics to enhance skills and
    personal capabilities.
- Projection – projection of the mind beyond the confines of the body.
- Psionic Attack – psionics tuned specifically to combat.
- Psionic Defence – psionics tuned specifically towards defence.

DDEFININGEFINING P PSIONICSSIONICS



- Ship Integration – integrating psionic capabilities with a
    starship, augmenting or even replacing certain functions.
- Tapping – drawing psionic power from others and from one's
    own physical characteristics.
- Temporal manipulation – the mental manipulation of time,
    allowing time travel.

USING A PSIONIC TALENT


Basic and Advanced talents are fully explored in the next chapter but
all use the same rules for psionic talents.

To activate a talent, the psion must make a skill check using the
appropriate talent (Telepathy, Telekinesis and so on), adding his
Psionic Strength characteristic DM and any other DMs. He must also
spend the listed number of Psionic Strength points if he succeeds
or one point if he fails. If this cost brings him below 0 Psionic
Strength, then any excess points are applied to his Endurance score
as damage. A character with no Psionic Strength points cannot
attempt to activate a power. Using a talent in combat is a significant
action. Many abilities are ranged.

The Psionic Range table lists the number of points required to project
an ability out to a given range – these must be paid as well as any

points to activate the ability. Each talent has a different set of costs,
with the exception of Awareness – all Awareness abilities apply to
the psion only. The range bands are the same as those for combat;
see page 64 of the Traveller Core Rulebook for more information.

For example, a Psion could read the mind of a target at Medium range
using the Telepathy power read surface thoughts for 3 Psionic Strength
points (2 for the ability, 1 for the range).

DEFINING PSIONICS



This chapter details the development of psionic abilities; how they
occur, how they are discovered and how they are then trained and
developed.

The Traveller rules takes the stance that psionics are tested for and
developed in an institutional framework; this may or may not fit
your campaign. Various ways for uncovering and training psionic
talents are explored in this chapter.

LATENT PSIONIC POTENTIAL


The old myth has it that only 10% of the brain is used to its full
potential, inferring that the other 90% is where psionic powers
are stored, locked from sight until some trigger blows away the
cobwebs and reveals a psion in all their glory. Yet brain imaging
techniques such as PET (Positron Emission Tomography) and FMRI (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) have established that a
great deal of the brain is in constant use, with different sections
being used to different degrees for different tasks. Small amounts
of damage to the brain can have profound physical and neurological
effects, which means that all of the brain is important and a lot of
it is in constant use – far more than the 10% myth would have us
believe.

For the purposes of Traveller , it is assumed that psionic abilities
are present in everyone. The vast majority of people have a very,
very low level of Psionic Strength – too low to manifest as psionic
powers, yet strong enough to trigger that sixth sense, gut-feeling
and personal intuition that everyone relies upon from time to time.
In some, though, through the unique structure of their brain and the
way certain areas work together, Psionic Strength is much stronger

### DDOORSOORS OFOF P PERCEPTIONERCEPTION

and draws not just on brain functions but also the energy that runs
throughout the entire body. These people have the potential to
become psions, if their capabilities are identified, understood and
trained in the right way.

This is known as Latent Psionic Potential – the naturally occurring but
untrained, barely developed capability to use psionic powers. Some
races, such as the Zhodani of the Third Imperium, have a higher
propensity for psionics than others. In some campaigns, psions
arise not because of training at a psionics institute but as a result
of laboratory experiments (drugs or intellect boosting, say) or as a
result of mutation or specialized genetic selection or manipulation.
The course of Latent Psionic Potential may therefore have some
consequences for psionic characters, as discussed below.

Determining Latent Psionic Potential
Page 152 of the Traveller Core Rulebook details how to determine
Psionic Strength. However, this presupposes that Latent Psionic
Potential is strong enough in the first place (as the result of Referee
permission). Another way is to randomly determine Latent Psionic
Potential, as detailed here.

- Roll 2d6 and apply the appropriate DMs, according to your
    character's background, campaign type and so on
- If the result is 11+, the character is psionic and Psionic Strength
    is determined as per page 152 of the _Traveller Core Rulebook_
    and the notes regarding Psionic Strength on page 4 of the first
    chapter of this book.

If the roll fails, even with DMs being applied, then the character has
not been able to realise his Latent Psionic Potential. He may attempt
again in a year but must throw 12+ to realise that potential.

PSIONIC TRAINING


Having realised psionic potential and calculated Psionic
Strength, the character is now in a position to be formally
trained in psionics, developing his talents and powers. The
Psionic Powers chapter, beginning on page 55, details the
various learning DMs for basic and advanced talents. This
section focuses on training options and offers guidance on
what talents are likely to be available to the character.

This section presupposes one of two things:

- Psionic potential is being realised before the character
embarks on a formal _Traveller_ career, as detailed in the
Psionic Careers chapter
... _or_ ...
- Psionic potential is being realised after the career process
has finished and the character is actively travelling and
adventuring.

treats psionic abilities. An order of justice-upholding knights in
an ancient galactic republic might, for example, exclusively train
young acolytes in developing their potential, resulting in a +5 or

If the enrolment fails, the character may try again the following year
but at a –1 DM for each subsequent enrolment attempt.

Various options present themselves for training and are described
below. The options available to characters need to be based on what
fits the campaign, although most options have some place in most
campaign types.

Psionics Institute
Institutes fall into two broad categories:

- Universities where study of psionics forms a core competency
- Dedicated institutes where only psionics are studied and
    developed

Depending on how psionics are viewed in the campaign setting,
university study might be impossible and psionic institutes might be
shady, underground organizations that need to keep their existence
a secret.

Enrolling in one or the other is therefore dependent on the legality of
psionics in society. One might have to struggle to even find a contact
that can put a character in touch with an underground institute,
for example. In other circumstances it may be as easy as filling in
an online application, turning up for the interview, undergoing a
test for Latent Psionic Ability and then attending the courses and
partaking in trials and experiments.

IF PSIONICS ARE OPENLY TOLERATED AND PROMOTED


Both universities and psionic institutes are available. Both can
test for Latent Psionic Potential and the level of competence may
provide an additional DM to the Latent Psionic Potential roll. Roll

Once enrolled, study and development is conducted in blocks of 4
months. As part of their training, characters can attempt to learn
one of the offered talents per 4 month block and pay the appropriate
training fee, which depends on the quality of the establishment. The
talents available again depend on quality of training, as indicated
below.

The Learning DM is applied to the Learning DM for the talent
the psion is training in – see the Psionic Powers chapter for the
lists of basic and advanced talent Learning DMs. The cost is per
talent studied and is payable in advance of study. If the talent is
unsuccessfully developed (as a result of Learning DMs), then half
the fee is repaid.

A character can remain in training at a university or institute for a
full year (as long as he can afford the fees) before having to re-enrol.
The re-enrolment is the same as for the first enrolment but with a
+1DM. A character can only re-enrol twice more (so a maximum of
three years full study) before he must find a new establishment to
continue his psionic development.

IF PSIONICS ARE ILLEGAL


Psions are often viewed with fear and distrust. In some campaigns,
psionic development may be actively outlawed with known psions
not just registered with the authorities but persecuted, exiled or
interred (and usually subjected to psionic restraint so that their
powers cannot be used).

Training psionic powers is therefore much more difficult to do.
No university or official seat of learning will train in psionics.
Underground psionics institutes may still exist but working in
secret and with funding and equipment denied (not to mention the

constant vigilance of the authorities), the quality and costs of study
will be lower and higher respectively.

The Quality roll for the psionic institute is subject to a –2 DM.
The costs for training are also increased by 20%, regardless of the
quality of the establishment. Enrolment is the same but is a risky
enterprise. Any character attempting to enrol in an underground
psionic institute must throw Stealth or Deception 8+ to avoid arrest
by the authorities. If arrested, then whatever punishment society
enforces is brought to bear and the character cannot attempt to
enrol again, within that society (being either monitored by the
authorities or blackballed by the institute, which does not want to
run the risk of discovery).

Mystical Order
Certain mystical or religious orders school their adherents in psionic
development, often wrapped-up in the lore of their belief and treated,
perhaps, as divine powers or even magic.

A character who chooses the Mystical Order profession need
not go through the process presented here; it is designed for
characters who convert to the order or join it, after their formal
career in another service has ended. Orders that take psionic
powers seriously tend to have their own training academies and
mentors who can offer training services equivalent to the best
psionics institutes – even if they lack the equipment that the
scientific establishments have in abundance, relying on traditional
methods for developing talents.

The first procedure is to gain acceptance to the order; this is generally
Edu 8+, reflecting the character's ability to show the appropriate
devotion and understanding of practices and requirements. A DM

for Psionic Strength may also be appropriate, if the order places high
stock on psionic capability and if the character has already tested for
psionic potential.

Training in psionic talents takes 4 months, under the tutelage of
trained mentors, however training costs may be negligible or nil,
on the understanding that the character then serves the order's
needs in some capacity. Training costs should be no higher than Cr.
100,000 for a basic talent but may be considerably less.

The talents on offer depend largely on the order's nature. Some may
be taboo and some advanced talents may be trained as basic talents
if they are a standard part of the order's belief and practice system.

The Mystical Order Psionics Approach table (on page 10) can be
used to determine an order's approach to psionics on-the-fly.

Psionic Mentor
A mentor takes on a student and trains him in developing his Latent
Psionic Potential and his talents. A mentor may very well lack the
kind of facilities available to religious orders and psionics institutes,
so the time spent training in a talent is generally one year rather
than 4 months (see below); but the trade-off is that all the student
needs to do is pay for his own upkeep in this period and perhaps
act as an apprentice and companion to the mentor for the duration
of the study.

How one comes across a mentor is a campaign decision that may
be the result of an Ally or Contact developed during character
creation or one made during game play. The mentor need not be
the archetypal hermetic mystic or exiled psion; he might be from a
mundane background with a genuine enthusiasm for the psionics
craft, eager to pass-on his knowledge for ends good or ill.

The amount of time a mentor needs to spend in training his
apprentice is always a minimum of 4 months. To calculate how
many additional months must be spent in training, subtract the
mentor's skill in the psionics talent being trained from 8 and add
the difference to the base of 4 months.

For example, old Ben is training his naive young apprentice in the art
of telekinesis. Ben has Telekinesis 2, so it will take him (8–2)+4 = 10
months of training to bring his apprentice to Telekinesis 0.

The benefit of a mentor is constant, one-on-one tuition. The Learning
DM for the talent being taught gains a +1 DM reflecting the close
relationship between master and pupil. Naturally enough, a student
can only learn those talents that the mentor himself is trained in,
so the Referee will need to decide these talents in advance, making
appropriate, campaign-contextual decisions, as to the mixture of
basic and advanced talents the mentor knows.

Time Spent With Other Psions
The simple act of constant exposure to other psions can result in
Latent Psionic Potential being realised and talents being developed.
This is neither an easy nor guaranteed process; psionics are not
contagious, however by observing and experiencing active psionics
on a daily basis, one may realise one's own latent potential and
develop a psionic talent.

If a character is taken and deliberately trained, then use either the
mentor or psionic institute rules, presented earlier, for the training
period. If the character simply wants to see if his realised psionic
potential translates into a fully-fledged psionic talent, without
dedicated training, use this system:

Test for Latent Psionic Potential, with appropriate DMs as outlined
in the table on page 7.

Roll Psi 10+. If successful, the character develops a Raw Talent. The
talent should reflect the prevailing psionic talents being used in
the society where the character has spent his time. Alternatively it
can be a completely random talent that has been surfaced through
simple experience and exposure. A Raw Talent is not a trained talent
but it is not a completely untrained one either. The character can
operate the powers of the talent but at a –1 DM (rather than –3 for
an untrained skill) until he becomes trained, by one of the methods
described in this chapter.

A Raw Talent does not grant access to all of the powers in that
talent. The Raw Talent psion has a number of powers equal to
1+ his Psionic Strength DM (of course, he cannot exceed the
maximum number of powers associated with a talent). Full
training to bring him up to level 0 may not grant access to all of
the talent's powers.

Personal Experimentation/Development/
Trauma
This method of acquiring psionic powers is based on the scenario
that the character realises his own psionic potential, either through
personal intuition and experimentation or acquires them as a result
of physical or emotional trauma that unlocks the Psionic Strength
he never realised he possessed.

Characters who acquire psionic abilities in this way always treat
their talents as Raw Talents, as described in the section above. This
means the use of the talent is at a –1 DM until formal training takes
place and the raw psion has 1+ Psionic Strength DM powers for
that talent. Unlocking powers in this way is likely to be either abrupt
or mentally stressful. So, the character must successfully roll End
8+ to avoid gaining a level of Psionic Trauma as a result of either
experimentation or emotional/physical trauma that acted as the
catalyst for the psionics. If the roll is a natural 2, the character gains
2 levels of Psionic Trauma – but he also gains an additional Raw
Talent, determined randomly.

DDOORSOORS OFOF P PERCEPTIONERCEPTION



Developing the Raw Talent into a fully trained talent requires either
a mentor or formal training as previously discussed.

Physical Disability and Natural Psionics
Psions who are physically disadvantaged, yet psionically powerful,
are a staple of SF. If a Referee permits it and a character desires it,
the following process can be used to create such a character.

- Latent Psionic Potential is not checked for; it is present
    already.
- The character starts with a base Psionic Strength of 1d3.
- Physical characteristics (Str, Dex and End) are rolled for as
    normal.
- The character then transfers points from the physical
    characteristics to Psionic Strength, at a ratio of 2 physical
    points to each Psionic Strength point.
- No physical characteristic can fall below 1.
- Psionic Strength cannot exceed the maximum of 15 (unless the
    campaign setting is designed to accommodate higher Psionic
    Strength scores).
- The depletion of physical characteristics must be described by
    the character: stunted growth; limb deformity; vastly weakened
    immune system and so forth.
- The talents that the character possesses, at level 0, are
    determined randomly using the table below. The character
    should record how many physical characteristic points have
    been translated into Psionic Strength points and cross-
    reference against both the basic and advanced talent columns.
    The result is how many talents are known.

Total Physical Characteristic Points
Translated to Psionic Strength

Basic
Talents

Advanced
Talents
2-4 1 —
5-9 2 —
10-14 2 1
15-19 3 1
20-24 3 2
25-29 4 2
30-33 4 3

The number of talents that are considered trained (i.e. level 0) is
equal to the Psi DM. Thus, a character who has transferred 24
physical characteristic points into 12 Psionic Strength points has 3
basic talents and 2 advanced talents. His Psionic Strength DM is +2,
meaning that 3 of those talents, either basic or advanced, begin at
level 0. The remaining talents are Raw Talents, with a –1 DM.

Every Raw Talent has access to 1d3 powers, although training the
Raw Talent to level 0 will increase the available powers to their full
complement.

DOORS OF PERCEPTION



This chapter provides career paths for psions: both psions who are
part of a dedicated psionics agency (such as the Psi Corp of Babylon
5's universe) and psions as part of the established career paths
detailed in the Traveller Core Rulebook.

In the case of psions in established careers, it is assumed that the
psion has been identified and given some form of basic training and
development before the career takes place; he is therefore known to
his superiors as a psion and given duties and assignments that make
the most of his capabilities. This assumes, of course, that services
in your Traveller campaign make active use of psions: if they do not (because they fear them or because psions are outlawed) then you
need not use the career tables and options presented in this chapter
and stick with those of the Traveller Core Rulebook.

If you are using one of Mongoose's licensed Traveller settings, such
as Babylon 5 or Judge Dredd , then the rules for psions presented
in that setting should take precedence over those presented here,
although you will find, by and large, that licensed settings follow
the core mechanics and make use of the talents, both basic and
advanced, found in this book.

This chapter also provides several new careers tailored specifically
to psions with certain talents. There is therefore the Temporal
Agency career, the Inter-Dimensional Agent career and the Psion-Spacefarer career. These are careers designed to use the advanced
talents found in the next chapter and both players and Referees will
need to be familiar with those talents (and Referees allow them in
the first place, as part of the campaign).

### PPSIONSION C CAREERSAREERS

DEDICATED PSION AGENCY


The dedicated Psion Agency is a body concerned with identifying,
recruiting, developing and policing other psions. Its resources
are contracted out to other services although it maintains its own
agenda and activities.

The Psi Agency may be a covert, clandestine operation or one
sanctioned by a state or government, depending on the campaign
type. Recruits to the Psi Agency are all potentially psionic and Psi
Strength should be determined for the character (with modifications
for age and previous career terms), although Talents should not
be determined before the career starts, if this is the character's
inaugural career. Any Talents already determined as a result of
previous careers are permissible.

Enlistment: Psi 6+
Int 8+ gain a +1 DM to the Qualification Check.
If you are aged 30 or more, you have a –4 DM to your Qualification
Check.
–2 DM for every previous career.

Assignments: Choose one of the following:

- Research: You are involved in psionic research, both theoretical
    and practical.
- Pursuit: You are responsible for tracking down latent psions
    and hunting rogue psions for punishment, conditioning or
    study.
- Liaison: You form part of an elite team that advises governments,
    rulers or corporations on psionic matters.

Basic Training: You are trained in one Basic Talent without needing
to roll to learn it. You begin with that Talent at Level 0. Roll 1d6 to
determine which talent:

1. Awareness 2. Clairvoyance 3. Telekinesis
4. Telepathy 5. Teleportation 6. Special

PPSIONSION C CAREERSAREERS PSION CAREERS



If you roll Special, you may select 1d3+2 Powers from _any_ of the Basic Talents. These form a Talent particular to you; give it an appropriate
name. This Talent begins at 0 and improves in the same way as any other Talent. However, when you learn new Talents, the Powers it
contains that replicate your specialized talent are not replaced with others.

PSION ARMY


Some armies make use of psions to supplement field capabilities
and for intelligence-gathering purposes. Although psionically-trained soldiers may well be attractive, their use on the battlefield
can be counterproductive; developing a psion is costly and placing
a psion soldier in the line of fire poses a risk to that investment.
However, some armies may well deploy psionic troops in a field of
conflict to act as combatants, so this is reflected in the Battlefield
Service tables and events.

Enlistment: Psi 6+.

- End 8+, gain +1 DM to the Qualification Check.
- If you are aged 30 or more, you have a –4 DM to your
    Qualification Check.
- –2 DM for every previous career.

Assignments: Choose one of the following:

- Intelligence: You were involved in intelligence gathering,
    surveillance and logistics, using your powers to give your side
    the edge.
- Infantry: You formed part of a psion infantry unit, employing
    your abilities on the battlefield.
- Special Forces: You were part of an elite Special Forces unit,
    using your powers to enhance the extraordinary skills already
    in evidence within the team.

PSION DRIFTER


Psion Drifters may well be renegades from a regime that actively
persecutes psions. Alternatively, they may have become drifters
following some form of mental trauma related to their abilities
which makes them either unemployable elsewhere, a liability or
socially damaged so that drifting is preferable to remaining in the
comfort of a fixed society. Psion Drifters may thus be criminals as
much as renegades or wanderers.

Qualification: Automatic.

Assignments: Choose one of the following:

- Barbarian: You lived on a primitive world without the benefits
    of technology, persecuted for your powers.
- Wanderer: You lived hand to mouth in slums and starports across
    the galaxy, travelling at random, evading your persecutors.
- Scavenger: You worked as a low-level blue collar or on a salvage
    crew, keeping your abilities hidden as much as possible.

PSION CAREERS PSION CAREERS



PSION NAVY


As with the army, psions are valuable to the navy for their capabilities in
intelligence gathering and surveillance. However, given the complexities of
space travel and the nature of some psionic talents, they can also be useful
as astrogators, communications specialists and diagnosticians. Some
navies of a sufficiently developed TL may use psions as pilots; however,
it is recommended that the Psion Spacefarer career is used for developing
psion characters who are dedicated to piloting space vessels.

The navy does not, traditionally, train its own psions but recruits
already trained psions. It is therefore necessary for psion characters
to have 1 trained Talent before joining.

Enlistment: Int 8+.
If you are aged 34 or more, you have a –4 DM to your enlistment check.
–2 DM for every previous career.
+1 DM for Psi 8+.

Assignments: Choose one of the following:

- Line/Crew: You served as a general crewman or officer on a
    ship of the line. An average Naval career.
- Engineering/Gunnery: You served as a specialist technician on
    a ship. This gives good technical skills but is difficult to advance
    in unless you are highly intelligent.
- Psion Auxiliary: You served as a member of a dedicated team
    of psions providing support across a wide range of functions:
    astrogation, intelligence, comms, remote ops and so on.

to. You may either gain a Benefit roll for this term or gain a level in either Pilot (Spaceship), Astrogation, Engineer or Gunner.
44 You find yourself taking command when a bridge hit incapacitates senior staff. Either gain Leadership or take a +4 DM to your
next Advancement roll (navy only).
45 Roll Psi 8+. If successful you become an indispensable part of the bridge staff. You are automatically promoted. If you fail, you
still impress; gain a skill from the Advanced Education table, a Contact or +2 to your next advancement check (navy only)
46 The Admiral is seeking a new _aide de camp_. Roll Soc + Psi 9+. If successful you are chosen. The Admiral becomes a Contact and
you gain Steward 1. If you fail, you may attempt this roll again next term but only have this one additional attempt to make the
grade.
51 Your ship undergoes a strange experience whilst in jump or hyperspace. Roll End 10+. If you succeed, when the ship emerges,
an Advanced Talent has been awoken within you. Your Referee will determine which. If you fail the roll, you suffer 1d3 levels of
Psionic Trauma.

superiority.
53 Your commanding officer takes an interest in your career. Either gain Tactics or take a +4 DM to one Advancement roll (in any

4 + 1 Social.
5 +1 Psi.

–4 DM to your Survival throw for next term. If you choose _not_ to join the group, you suffer a –2 DM to your next advancement
check but gain a +4 DM to your Survival throw.
55 You are asked to volunteer for a hazardous mission. If you accept, roll Dexterity + Psi. Fail and the mission fails and you must
roll on the Injury table. Succeed and you gain a Citation for Meritorious Conduct Under Fire.
56 Roll Psi 8+. If you succeed, you uncover a political or bureaucratic conspiracy that threatens fleet security. You must make a
choice: keep it a secret and receive a healthy bribe or pay-off for your complicity or go public and risk making enemies. If you
choose to take a pay-off, you receive Cr. 10,000 in a clandestine payment that you cannot access until you muster out. A cloud of
suspicion follows you everywhere. If you go public, your superiors reward you with an automatic promotion but you automatically
gain 1 Rival and 1 Enemy as a result of your whistle blowing.
61 You are groomed for higher command by a senior officer. Either gain him as an Ally or take a +4 DM to your next Advancement
roll (in any naval career).

66 You display heroism in battle, saving the whole ship. You are automatically promoted.

PSION ROGUE


Psions who use their abilities for personal gain are Rogues: criminals,
fraudsters and so forth. This is a self-serving profession and the psion
may have been forced into it as a result of persecution. However, by
and large, it is a lifestyle choice driven by selfish motives, rather
than desperation.

Qualification: Dex 7+.
–2 DM for every previous career.
+1 DM for Psi 8+.

Assignments: Choose one of the following:

- Thief: You stole from the rich and gave to... well, yourself
    usually.
- Mind Stealer: You stole secrets directly from the minds of the
    psionically untrained, selling them to the highest bidder or
    using them yourself for profit.
- Corsair: You were a space-going pirate and commerce raider,
    using your powers to subdue others quickly and without the
    need for weapons.

PSION SCOUTS


In the same way that the army and navy use psions, so does the
Scout service. However, given the hazardous nature of scouting,
psion scouts are a relative rarity owing to the costs involved.
Nevertheless, psions serving within the scouts have an incredibly
useful role to play in survey and first contact, especially telepaths
and empaths, who may be the best ways of communicating with a
new species or civilization.

Enlistment: Int 5+.

feelings become known and the ambassador reciprocates. Gain an Ally (who is now also your lover) but you must leave this
career under a cloud of shame.
4 Roll Psi 8+. If you succeed, you uncover a plot to discredit the ambassador. He or she is deeply impressed and reports this

5 Develop a hatred of planets. You are only comfortable on a ship, out amongst the stars.
6 Undergo a religious conversion, believing you have witnessed a god or gods out in the blackness of space. Attempt to convert
others to your new-found faith. Roll 2d6 and on 7+ lose an ally or contact but gain a contact who you have converted.

system is undeniable and you must, in some way, engineer a plan to travel to this area of space. You cannot plot the coordinates
using standard means; you just know how to guide someone else (a ship's pilot or navigator, say). If you fail, the dream is a
tantalising glimpse of a place you are drawn to. These dreams and visions will keep occurring until, by chance, you stumble upon
the star system that haunts you.

2 Weaponry
3 Food production
4 Atmospheric control
5 Terraforming
6 Psionics
The find has to be reported and agents from an outside authority commandeer the project. You and your team are sworn to secrecy
and transferred to other duties. Towards the end of your term, someone working for the agency who confiscated the technology
contacts you and reveals a secret about the experiments that have been undertaken with it (the Referee will decide what this secret
is). If you can find the right outlet, the information you have will be worth millions of Credits. However, others know that you know
and will attempt to silence you. Gain 1d3 Enemies and a –1 DM to all Survival throws.

launch a detailed investigative mission that you will be involved with. Gain an additional +2 to your next Advancement roll.
65 Roll Astrogation 8+. If you succeed, there is no other event. If you fail, a misjump takes your ship too close to the gravity well of a
gas giant and your ship struggles to free itself. Roll Psi + Pilot (Spacecraft) 9+ to successfully break free of the gravitational pull. If
you fail you, your crew and your ship are lost for 1d3 terms. At the end of this period you suddenly reappear in known space and
are rescued. You recall nothing of your time away but you have developed one Advanced Talent of the Referee's choosing.

INTER-DIMENSIONAL AGENCY
The Inter-Dimensional Agency monitors nearby parallels of existence
and, to some extent, polices them, counteracting those who would
disrupt the fabric of the multiverse

Characters who are part of the inter-dimensional agency must be
Dimensionally Aware or qualified Dimensional Manipulators; or the
Referee must be willing to allow dimensional travel via some other
means (typically inter-dimensional gates, portals or multiverse-manipulation machines) as part of his campaign.

Enlistment: Dimensional Manipulation Talent 7+.
–2 DM for every previous career.
+1 DM for Int 10+.

Assignments: Choose one of the following:

- Troubleshooter: You are skilled in moving through the parallels
    to maintain cosmic order.
- Dimensional Agent: Remain in your own dimension but
    are aware of others and use your abilities to influence trans-
    dimensional events from where you are.
- Wayfarer: For some reason you were adrift in the multiverse,
    arriving in one dimension or another with little control over
    how or why.

PSION CAREERS PSION CAREERS



PSION SPACEFARER


This career is available if psion-powered spacecraft are a part of
the campaign. Characters following the career need to be qualified
Machine Symbiotic psions to qualify.

The career has three specializations. Pilot and Navigator are
straightforward assignments; the character uses his psionic abilities
to assist his duties in these areas.

The third specialization is _Integral_. Integral characters are those
individuals who choose to become surgically and psychically
integrated with the physical systems of the ship, becoming one with
it and capable of running several systems (pilot, navigation and
gunnery, for example) simultaneously. Integral is not a reversible
career option; once selected as a specialization, the character
commits himself to the operations necessary to fully integrate with
the vessel and the surgery is not reversible. It may therefore be that
Referees do not want to allow this career specialization for Player
Characters: the character will, essentially, _become_ the spaceship.
As a challenge for any _Traveller_ campaign though, the Integral
specialization may be worth pursuing.

Note that Integrals are not promoted, per se; when they advance
they are transplanted to either a new, larger vessel or have their
existing vessel upgraded. When an Integral is promoted he may
choose to be either transplanted or upgraded (assuming he can
control a larger ship) – the Transplants and Upgrades table on page
49 includes the appropriate details.

Enlistment: Machine Symbiosis Talent 7+.
–2 DM for every previous career.
+1 Edu 10+.

Assignments: Choose one of the following:

- Pilot: You are a ship's pilot, using your psionic powers to
    enhance and push the capabilities of your starship.
- Navigator: Your psionic powers enhanced the navigational
    capabilities of your ship.
- Integral: You have taken the ultimate step of surgically and
    psychically integrating with your ship; its electronics and systems
    becoming extensions of your own nervous system and psyche.

NEW SKILLS


This chapter introduces several new skills for psionic characters,
relating to certain professions. Most of these skills relate to temporal
and dimensional events but they can also be studied by non-psion
characters.

LORE (ORDER)
This skill covers the conventions, practices and secrets of your
particular order. You are trained in using the Lore skill to help in
problem solving, convincing others of your veracity and in dealings
with others within your order or who follow it without any formal
membership.

_Using your knowledge and piety to impress others: 1-6 seconds, Average (+0)_

_Using Lore to understand a particular practice or gain an insight into its
significance, 1-6 minutes, Average (+0)_

_Applying your knowledge to a particular situation or problem requiring
tact and negotiation: 1-6 hours, Difficult (–2)_

SCIENCE (PSIONICS)
This branch of Science studies the nature and application of psionic
abilities, although it does not confer the abilities themselves.
Characters with Science (Psionics) can use the skill to determine the
nature of a demonstrated psionic talent or power and can also test
others for psionic potential. The skill covers the theory of psionics
as well as the practical applications of psionic powers.

_Identifying a basic talent or power: 1-6 seconds, Average (+0)_

_Identifying an advanced talent or power: 1-6 minutes, Average (+0)_

_Testing for psionic potential: 1-6 days, Difficult (–2)_

SCIENCE (TEMPORAL)
The Temporal science branch deals with the nature of time and
offers insights into its peculiarities. Practitioners are experienced in
understanding how time can be influenced by external factors, such
as dimensional anomalies, quantum events, string theory, gravity
disturbances and FTL travel. This allows for certain physical events
to be predicted or measured but it does not necessarily mean that a

particular consequence can be predicted with any great accuracy or
what the outcome of a paradox might be.

Identifying a temporal anomaly: 1-6 minutes, Average (+0)

Predicting general consequences of a temporal event: 1-6 minutes,
Difficult (–2)

Charting the long-term consequence of a temporal event: 1-6 hours,
Difficult (–2)

SCIENCE (DIMENSIONAL)
The study and understanding of parallel dimensions and worlds,
based on quantum theory, string theory, super-string theory and
so on. The practitioner of Dimensional Science understands how
planes of existence interact, depending upon their natures and can
identify weaknesses or potential weaknesses in the barriers between
worlds and planes.

Identifying a portal, gate or inter-dimensional pathway: 1-6 hours,
Average (+0)

Studying the nature of a newly discovered parallel: 1-6 weeks, Difficult (–2)

Building a trans-dimensional device: 1-6 months (or years), Very Difficult (–4)

TEMPORAL PARADOX


This skill provides the practitioner with the reasoning, insight and
logic abilities to extrapolate the likely effects of a paradox resulting
from time travel or anomalies in the space-time continuum. With
applied study, the practitioner can work-out the necessary solutions
for restoring equilibrium or understanding if a disruptive event is
beneficial or harmful.

Identifying a temporal paradox and its general conditions: 1-6 minutes,
Average (+0)

Working out the best way to resolve a paradox: 1-6 hours, Difficult (–2)

Correcting the nature of the paradox: 1-6 days (or longer), Very Difficult (–4)

PSION CAREERS



### PPSIONICSIONIC P POWERSOWERS

Psionic powers are divided into Basic and Advanced talents. Basic
talents are the most commonly encountered psionic powers and are
easier to learn and train. Advanced talents are less frequently found,
are difficult to learn and train and have both dramatic effects and
consequences.

This chapter details both Basic and Advanced talents and the powers
found within that talent. The basic talents are reproduced from the
Psionics chapter of Traveller Core Rulebook for ease of reference,
along with the Psionic Range chart, which is used to determine
scales of distance and the Psionic Strength points required to use
powers at different ranges.

OPTIONS FOR TALENTS AND POWERS


The range of talents and powers presented in this chapter is
comprehensive enough for most science fiction campaigns,
however new abilities will always present themselves – inspired
by or replicating, powers found in film, television and books. This
section provides some guidance on creating and customising talents
and powers for use in your Traveller campaigns.

Custom Talents
Certain professions or campaigns may require custom talents to be
developed. This is essentially the gathering together of disparate
Basic and Advanced powers under a single, trainable group that is
used as a psionic specialization.

The Referee always has the final say over what powers can
be grouped together, be this creating a brand new talent or
customising an existing talent (swapping powers from two or
more talents, for instance); however, there are some guidelines
to be followed.

- Powers should be complementary in nature, rather than being
    diametrically opposed.
- No talent should have more than six powers; ideally three to four.
  - The Learning DM for a talent is always based on the most
       difficult Learning DM for a power's talent. _For example, mixing_
       _the Telepathy and Ship Integration powers into a single talent_
       _would mean this talent has a Learning DM of –4 (the Learning_
       _DM for the Ship Integration-sourced powers)._

Creating New Powers
The easiest way to create a new power is to find a similar power
from those in this chapter and subtly tweak the effects to achieve
what is needed. It might be apt to reduce the costs for range, for
example or reduce the difficulty of a power if it is in very common
use and easy to achieve in the campaign setting than as directed in
this book.

However, if creating an entirely new power is necessary, several
questions need to be considered:

- What is the effect of the power and what does it achieve?
- Is the power in keeping with the campaign's power-level and
    setting type?
- To what degree will the power overbalance characters working
    together?
- Should there be a power that opposes the new power in some
    way, to achieve game balance?
- How should the Psionic Strength cost and Difficulty of the
    power be structured (bearing in mind that a power should be
    usable but not so easy to use that abuse is likely)?
- Does the power logically belong to a particular talent or is a new
    talent required to accommodate it?

Some of these questions will be easier to answer than others and the
question of game balance is always one that should be born in mind;
however, using psionics in any campaign will introduce a certain
degree of game imbalance – and that can be part of the enjoyment.
Psions are special individuals, signalled to be above the norm by dint
of their abilities. Striving for perfect game balance should not be an
all-consuming concern but a question considered in the light of a new
power's effects and consequences for the Players Characters.

PPSIONICSIONIC P POWERSOWERS PSIONIC POWERS



BASIC TALENTS


Basic talents are the common psionic talents and cover the
most familiar psychic territory; telepathy, ESP, telekinesis and
teleportation. The word 'basic' is a misnomer; the powers found
in these talents can be every bit as potent as those found in the
advanced talents, tackled later.

BASIC TALENT LEARNING DMS



Talent Learning DM
Telepathy +4
Clairvoyance +3
Telekinesis +2
Awareness +1
Teleportation 0
Per previous talent acquisition check –1

Telepathy
Telepathy is the talent of mind-to-mind contact. It is subtle by nature
but can also be used to bluntly crush the wills of those who oppose
the telepath.

LIFE DETECTION


The most elementary form of telepathy is the ability to detect the
presence of other minds. Life detection enables a character to
sense the presence of other minds, the number of minds present,
the general type of minds (animal, human and so on) and their
approximate location. Life detection is reasonably sophisticated
and can distinguish intelligent beings from bacteria or unimportant
animals in the area. It functions best at detecting intelligent minds.
Shielded minds are undetectable (whether the shield is natural or
artificial in origin). If an individual whom the telepath knows is 'life
detected' he or she will be recognized.

_Telepathy, Psionic Strength, 10-60 seconds, Easy (+4).
Costs 1+Range_

TELEMPATHY


The communication of emotions and basic feelings is accomplished
by telempathy. This ability serves well in the handling of animals
and beasts of burden but may also be applied as a psychological
weapon against humans. Sending of emotions such as love, hate,
fear and others may influence other beings (although not necessarily
in the manner desired). Telempathy also allows the emotions
and feelings of others to be read by a character. The Effect of the
check determines the strength of the projected emotion. Telepaths
will always recognize when someone is using telempathy to bend
their emotions but others will not. The change in mood may be
dramatic and inexplicable but most people will simply ascribe it to
the mercurial nature of human emotions. Shielded individuals are
immune to telempathy as they are all other Telepathy powers.

_Telepathy, Psionic Strength, 10-60 seconds, Routine (+2).
Costs 1+Range._

READ SURFACE THOUGHTS


The most widely known feature of Telepathy is the ability to read the
thoughts of other individuals. Only active, current thoughts are read
by this ability, with the subject (if himself not a telepath) unaware
of the activity. Individuals with telepathic ability cannot be read due
to the presence of their natural shields, unless they willingly lower
their shielding. The Effect of the check determines the clarity of the
telepath's perceptions.

Telepathy, Psionic Strength, 10-60 seconds, Average (+0).
Costs 2+Range.

SEND THOUGHTS


Complementary to the ability to read surface thoughts is the ability
to send thoughts to others. Such individuals need not themselves
be telepathic to receive such thoughts. Telepathic individuals are
normally open to such transmissions but may close their shields
against them if they become bothersome or threatening.

Telepathy, Psionic Strength, 10-60 seconds, Difficult (–2).
Costs 2+Range.

PROBE


The application of great psionic strength will enable a telepath
to delve deep into the mind of a subject and to then read his
innermost thoughts. Questioning can be used in the procedure to
force the subject to divulge specific information. The prober can
easily determine deliberate
untruths told (thought)
by the subject.
Probe cannot be
used against
a shielded
mind. Again,
the Effect of
the check
determines
the clarity of
the telepath's
perceptions.

PSIONIC POWERS PPSIONICSIONIC P POWERSOWERS



Telepathy, Psionic Strength, 1-6 minutes, Very Difficult (–4).
Costs 4+Range.

ASSAULT


Violence may be dealt by a telepath. An unshielded mind, when assaulted
telepathically, is rendered unconscious immediately and the character
suffers 2d6 + Effect damage. Unlike normal damage, assault damage
is applied to Psionic Strength (if the victim has it), then Intelligence,
then Endurance. Psionic Strength and Endurance return as normal (see pages 152 and 74 of the Traveller Core Rulebook respectively).
Intelligence returns at the rate of one point per day. When a shielded
mind is assaulted the two telepaths make opposed Telepathy checks. If
the attacker wins, the victim suffers damage as normal.

Telepathy, Psionic Strength, 1-6 seconds, Formidable (–6).
Costs 8+Range.

SHIELD


All telepathically able characters learn how to create a mental shield,
which protects the mind against unwanted telepathic interference.
Shield is automatically in force at all times and requires no Psionic
Strength point expenditure to maintain. However, while a telepath
has his shield up he cannot use any telepathic powers either. Shield
can be lowered to allow telepathic contact or to use telepathic
powers – this takes a mere thought (a free action in combat).

Clairvoyance
Clairvoyance is the general talent which, allows a person to sense
events at some location displaced from the viewer. There are several
levels of clairvoyant ability. Clairvoyance abilities allow eavesdropping
activities as well as spying and detection-free exploration of
situations. While telepathic life detection will determine the presence
of living minds in a closed room, for example, sense will determine if
a room is occupied or empty. Clairvoyant activity cannot be sensed
by others, including by other psionic individuals.

SENSE


The basic ability to sense things at some point in the distance. A
character will become aware of the most rudimentary characteristics
of a location when applying this ability. For example, the Referee
will give a basic description, without detail: 'a room containing
four dogs' or 'an open plain with a tree and no animals or men
present'. The clairvoyant character must state the range at which he
is applying his talent and will generally sense the most interesting or
important feature at that range. The Effect of the check determines
the level of accuracy and clarity.

Clairvoyance, Psionic Strength, 10-60 seconds, Routine (+2).
Costs 1+Range.

TACTICAL AWARENESS


With this ability, the character can perceive dangers and foes around
him using his clairvoyant abilities. This enhanced spatial perception

allows him to ignore the effects of darkness, smoke, fog or other
environmental effects that impede vision. He may also detect
hidden foes within range. The Effect of the check is how long the
enhanced awareness lasts in rounds.

Clairvoyance, Psionic Strength, 1-6 seconds, Average (+0).
Costs 2+Range

CLAIRVOYANCE


This specific ability allows actual remote viewing of a situation
at some displaced point. Rather than the 'snapshot' that sense
gives, clairvoyance allows the psion to observe as if he was there
in person. The clairvoyant character must state the range at which
he is applying his talent. The Effect of the check determines the
level of detail perceived and the duration in rounds the vision can
be maintained for.

Clairvoyance, Psionic Strength, 10-60 seconds, Average (+0).
Costs 2+Range.

CLAIRAUDIENCE


This ability is identical to clairvoyance, with the exception that it
allows hearing instead of seeing.

Clairvoyance, Psionic Strength, 10-60 seconds, Average (+0).
Costs 2+Range.

CLAIRSENTIENCE


This power combines the effects of clairvoyance and clairaudience.
The character is capable of both seeing and hearing a specific
situation.

Clairvoyance, Psionic Strength, 10-60 seconds, Difficult (–2).
Costs 3+Range.

Telekinesis
Telekinesis is the talent which allows objects to be manipulated
without physically touching them. Any manipulation is treated as
if the person was physically handling the item but physical danger,
pain or other stimuli are not present. Telekinesis includes a limited
amount of sensory awareness, sufficient to allow actual intelligent
manipulation.

TELEKINESIS


This basic form of the talent allows the character to move objects
at range. The Effect of the check determines the duration of the
telekinesis in rounds. The number of points spent determines the
Strength of the Telekinesis. It costs 1 Psi point to lift up to 100 kg (2
Psi points for 200 kg and so on).

Telekinesis, Psionic Strength, 1-6 seconds, Average (+0).
Costs Strength+Range.

PPSIONICSIONIC P POWERSOWERS PSIONIC POWERS



FLIGHT


By applying telekinesis to his own body the character can fly, or
at least levitate, over short distances. The character can fly for a
number of rounds equal to the Effect of the check at a speed of up
to six meters per round.

_Telekinesis, Psionic Strength, 1-6 seconds, Average (+0).
Costs 5._

TELEKINETIC PUNCH


Telekinesis can be used as a direct attack, smashing the foe with a
blast of telekinetic force. The damage inflicted is 2d6 + the Effect of
the check.

_Telekinesis, Psionic Strength, 1-6 seconds, Average (+0).
Costs 1+Range._

MICROKINESIS


This more challenging form of telekinesis allows for fine manipulation
of very small or even microscopic objects. A telekinetic can use this
power to pick locks, perform microsurgery, sabotage a computer
system and so forth. The range is always Personal.

_Telekinesis, Psionic Strength, 10-60 seconds, Difficult (–2).
Costs 3._

PYROKINESIS


By exciting the substance of an object the character can raise its
temperature, possibly even causing it to burst into flames. Roll 1d6
and add the Effect of the check.
Pyrokinesis Effect Target...
0-4 Becomes warmer but is undamaged.
5-8 Is burned, suffering 1d6 damage.
9+ Suffers 2d6 damage and may burst into flames if flammable.

_Telekinesis, Psionic Strength, 10-60 seconds, Difficult (–2).
Costs 3+Range._

Awareness
Awareness is the psionic talent which allows control of one's own
body. Awareness powers never have a range – they are used only
on yourself.

SUSPENDED ANIMATION


Personal body activity may be suspended for varying periods of time.
A character with Awareness may enter a suspended animation state (similar to cold sleep but without the intrinsic danger of death) by
willing himself into it. Such a state continues for 7 days without need
for food or water and with minimal air needs. Such a person could
effectively travel in a low passage berth without actually undergoing
cold sleep and its dangers. Suspended animation may be stopped at
any time previous to its duration expiring, provided external stimulus is
given to awaken the sleeper (such as a friend or a mechanical alarm).

Awareness, Psionic Strength, 1-6 minutes, Average (+0).
Costs 3.

ENHANCED AWARENESS


By focussing his mind, the character can improve his concentration
and ability to perform complex tasks. While under the effects of
enhanced awareness, the character may add his Psionic Strength
DM (if positive) to any skill checks. Enhanced awareness lasts until
the character fails a skill check or sleeps.

Awareness, Psionic Strength, 1-6 seconds, Average (+0).
Costs 1.

PSIONICALLY ENHANCED STRENGTH


Psionic Strength points may be converted to normal Strength
points on a temporary basis. The character makes the commitment,
reduces his Psionic Strength by a specific number of points and
increases his physical Strength characteristic by that number. In
no case may the number of Strength points gained exceed the
character's current level in Awareness and Strength may not be
increased beyond the character's racial maximum. Psionically
enhanced strength reaches its new level immediately, remains at
that peak for ten minutes and then declines at the rate of 1 Strength
point per minute until the normal Strength level is reached. This
power works as normal on wounded characters but their Strength
returns to the wounded level rather than the normal value. It
cannot be used as a 'quick heal'.

Awareness, Psionic Strength, 1-6 seconds, Average (+0).
Costs boosted Strength.

PSIONICALLY ENHANCED ENDURANCE


Psionically enhanced endurance works in exactly the same way as
psionically enhanced strength except the characteristic boosted
is Endurance rather than Strength, including its lack of healing
ability.

Awareness, Psionic Strength, 1-6 seconds, Average (+0).
Costs boosted Endurance.

Regeneration
Wounds and injuries may be healed rapidly. Strength, Dexterity
and Endurance lost to injury, disease, poison or other trauma
may be healed by the application of this ability, exchanging one
Psionic Strength point to regenerate one characteristic point. Any
amount of Psionic Strength may be expended with a single use
of regeneration but it may not be used again until all expended
Psionic Strength is recovered. Regeneration may also be applied
to the growing of new limbs or organs to replace lost ones or to
heal unrecovered old wounds suffered prior to psionic training.
Regeneration may not be used to counteract aging. Regeneration
is not capable of affecting others and may not be used for healing
or enhancing other characters.

PSIONIC POWERS PPSIONICSIONIC P POWERSOWERS



Awareness, Psionic Strength, 10-60 seconds, Very Difficult (–4).
Costs amount healed.

BODY ARMOR


By channelling psionic strength to his skeletal structure and
boosting his healing rate, the character can enhance his ability to
absorb damage. Body armor lasts for a number of rounds equal to
the Effect of the check and provides an armor rating equal to the
number of Psionic Strength points expended. This armor stacks
with worn armor as normal.

Awareness, Psionic Strength, 1-6 seconds, Very Difficult (–4).
Costs amount healed.

Teleportation always involves the movement of one's body to
another location. Independent items or other individuals may not
be moved. Teleportation involves certain requirements in order to
be accurate and to insure obedience of the laws of physics.

Preknowledge of Destination: A character must always have a mental
image of his or her destination before teleporting. This mental image
is acquired by personally visiting the location first (or viewing it from
a distance), having the mental image implanted in one's mind (by
telepathy) by another person who has visited the destination or by
viewing the location through clairvoyance. The key is to remember
that someone has to actually view the location – recorded images
are not enough.

Energy and Momentum: Teleportation involves serious restrictions
on movement in order to assure the conservation of energy and
momentum. On planetary surfaces, teleportation is restricted to
jumps of Very Distant range or less. Jumps at Very Distant range
involve disorientation for a period of 20 to 120 seconds (2d6 x10)
after arrival. This restriction results from the law of conservation of
momentum: on a rotating planet, two locations will have different
rotational speeds and directions. A jump from a point on the Earth's
equator to one of its poles would result in a total velocity difference
between the character and his surroundings of over 3,300 kph,
which would lead to a messy death in short order. Teleporting to
or from vehicles travelling at high speed can also result in energy
gains or losses. When teleporting into, onto or out of a fast-moving
vehicle the psion takes damage as if the vehicle had rammed
him at its current speed (see Traveller Core Rulebook , page 66).
Changes in altitude (actually all movement to locations of differing
gravitational potential) will result in potential energy changes,
manifesting themselves as changes in body temperature. A jump of
one kilometer straight down will result in a temperature increase of
2.5 degrees Celsius; this is sufficient to cause extreme fever, brain
damage and even death. A jump up will cool the body by the same
amount, with equally serious results. To be safe, a jump may not
involve an elevation change of more than 400 meters and multiple
jumps should not involve a cumulative elevation change of more
than 600 meters in one hour. These problems may be gotten around
through the use of technological devices: energy compensators,
heated suits and other means. Characters may feel driven to invent
such materials, commission their invention or seek them out from
those who already have them.

ADVANCED TALENTS


Advanced talents go beyond the powers available under the basic
talents found in this chapter and the Traveller Core Rulebook. Some
are very powerful, specific effects that will not suit all campaign types
or settings; conversely, basic talents tend to fit the profile for most
science fiction settings where psionics feature to some degree.

Referees need to consider which advanced talents are
permissible in their campaigns and even which powers within a
talent are permissible.

Teleportation
Teleportation is a talent that allows effectively instantaneous
movement from one point to another point without regard to
intervening matter. Psionic teleportation is limited to the movement
of the teleported character's body and (for highly skilled teleporters)
their clothing and weapons. Unlike the other talents, Teleportation
has only a single power: the ability to teleport yourself. Teleporting
without any equipment or clothing uses the Teleportation talent
with the Psionic Strength DM as a modifier. The act of teleporting
takes 1-6 seconds (a significant action in combat) and costs nothing
except what the psion spends on range.

Teleporting with up to 10 kg of equipment or clothing is Difficult (–2
DM) and costs 2 + range Psionic Strength points.

Teleporting with up to 500 kg of equipment is Very Difficult (–4 DM)
and costs 4 + range Psionic Strength points.

PPSIONICSIONIC P POWERSOWERS


PSIONIC POWERS



MANIPULATE AURA


With this power the psion can manipulate his aura's appearance.
On a successful Aura Perception roll he can convey perfect health,
appear to be more powerful than he is actually is or manipulate any
other condition that his aura signifies. A psion reading his aura will
only be aware that Manipulate Aura is being used if his attempt to
Read Aura has a higher Effect than the manipulating psion's own
Aura Perception roll.

Aura Perception, Psionic Strength, 1d6+Psi DM minutes, Difficult (–2).
Costs 3.

PROJECT AURA


Through this power the psion can project his aura to a distance and
even overlay his aura onto another organism. The distance of the
projection is a base of 10 meters + the psion's Psi DM; however,
for a further investment of Psi points, this range can be extended.
The psion can project his aura a further 10 + Psi DM meters for
every additional Psi point above the base cost. The projected aura
moves as the psion moves, whilst ever the projection is maintained.
The psion's personal aura still surrounds his physical person and is
visible to other psions if read directly.

Aura Perception, Psionic Strength, 1d6+Psi DM minutes, Difficult (–2).
Costs 4 + 1 additional point per 10+ Psi DM meters.

Dimensional Manipulation
This talent governs the perception and manipulation of parallel
dimensions (if they exist and are supported in a campaign). It is a
difficult talent to develop, as the psion has to be able to understand
and manipulate the barriers separating planes of existence – barriers
that exist at a quantum level.

As a general rule, a dimensionally aware psion can perceive
a number of alternate realities equal to his Psi DM +1 (if those
dimensions exist). Referees may increase this number if the
barriers between dimensions are particularly weak or reduce it if
they are especially strong.

DIMENSIONAL PORTALS


Travel between dimensions is possible only if a Dimensional
Portal is available. This may be a rift in time/space or an artificially
generated break in the dimensional barriers. Every portal is
assigned a Barrier Strength of between 0 and 6, with 0 being a
very weak barrier and 6 a very strong one. The Barrier Strength is
applied as a negative DM to the psion's Dimensional Manipulation
powers, as noted below.

LOCATE PORTAL


The psion can scan his local area (a radius of 10 x Psi DM in meters)
to see if a portal exists. If successful, the psion can gain an idea of
the portal's Barrier Strength depending on the Effect of his roll:

Aura Perception
All living organic creatures create an aura; a personal signature that
is as unique as DNA and which can be perceived and read by aura-sensitive psions. To a trained psion, an aura indicates the following:

- State of physical health
- State of mental health
- Degree of Psionic Power

Using the powers within this talent, the psion can read, interpret
and, to a certain extent, manipulate the aura of creatures and
himself. Every aura perceptive psion can see the aura surrounding
an organism as a glowing field of psychic energy; detailed
understanding of what the aura reveals about its owner is then
dependent on the Read Aura power.

READ AURA


The psion can drill-deep into the scintillating energy of an aura to
identify specifics about its owner. On a successful Aura Perception
roll he can determine if the organism is injured, either physically
and/or mentally and to what degree, even if physical symptoms are
not present. He can also determine if the organism is psionically
trained, although it is not possible to determine the specific talents
available to the organism. The psion can, however, gauge the
organism's Psionic Strength relative to his own (i.e. much stronger,
much weaker, equal and so forth).

_Aura Perception, Psionic Strength, 10-60 seconds, Easy (+4).
Costs 1._

MASK AURA


The psion can successfully mask his aura from other, aura-perceptive
psions. When masked, the psion produces no perceptible aura,
effectively becoming psychically invisible. Masking lasts for 1d6
minutes + the psion's Psi DM before it needs to be re-masked.

_Aura Perception, Psionic Strength, 1d6+Psi DM minutes, Average (+0).
Costs 2._

DIMENSIONAL COMMUNICATION


The psion can communicate with others using a located portal
without having to move into the dimension itself. The Barrier
Strength of the portal is applied as a negative DM to the skill roll.

Communication across the dimensions is dependent on other
psionic abilities, such as Telepathy and Clairvoyance; thus the
psion must have a trained communicative ability and must invest
Psi points in a particular power to communicate. Additionally, the
number of Psi points that must be invested in the Dimensional
Communication power is dependent on who and how, the psion
wishes to establish communication.

The base Psi cost establishes communication within any receptive
person on the other side of the barrier.

Base Psi cost x2 establishes communication with a specific
individual.

Dimensional Manipulation, Psionic Strength, 10-60 Seconds, Difficulty
depends on Portal Barrier Strength.
Costs 3.

CREATE PORTAL


Through this power the psion creates a portal between his own
and another dimension. This is always a Very Difficult task (–4)
and the created portal has a Barrier Strength equal to the number
of additional Psi points that the psion invests in its creation, with
the base Psi cost establishing a Barrier Strength 0 portal. A created
portal lasts for a number of hours equal to the psion's Psi DM x
1d6 – after which the portal must be re-established. The psion who
created the portal always treats it as Barrier Strength 0.

Dimensional Manipulation, Psionic Strength, 1-6 Minutes, Very Difficult (–4)
Costs 4 + Additional points for Barrier Strength.

MANIPULATE PORTAL


The psion can manipulate a dimensional portal, either reducing its
Barrier Strength, extending its existence or closing it altogether. The
Barrier Strength is applied as a negative DM to the skill roll and the
Psi points cost depends on the degree of manipulation:

- Reduce Barrier Strength: 2 points per point of Barrier Strength
    manipulated (making the barrier either stronger or weaker).
- Influence Portal Existence: 1 point per hour of existence
    manipulated – either extended or decreased.
- Immediate Portal Close: Barrier Strength x2.

Dimensional Manipulation, Psionic Strength, 1-6 Minutes, Difficulty
depends on Portal Barrier Strength.
Costs Variable.

Energy Kinesis
Energy Kinesis is the talent governing the manipulation of energy

- principally electricity but also temperature and light. The psion's
powers manipulate energy streams on a particular spectrum and
wavelength to achieve a particular effect.

Pyrokinesis is a part of this talent, just as it forms a part of the
Telekinesis talent; however the version presented as part of this
talent is of a more advanced nature and is renamed Thermokinesis,
reflecting its extended capabilities.

PSIONIC POWERS PSIONIC POWERS



ELECTROKINESIS


Electrokinesis is the manipulation of electrical energy and currents.
Using it, psions can divert power from one source to another (a
battery for instance or another, unpowered set of circuits), create
short-circuits or spikes and even draw upon their own electrical
energy to provide temporary power.

The psion needs to be in physical contact with whatever he is trying
to influence, electrically. For the basic Psi cost the psion can:

- Start an electrically powered device.
- Cause a device to stop.
- Overload the device with energy, causing it to fuse or short-
    circuit.

By introducing more Psi points, the psion converts his own, brain-generated electrical energy into a usable energy source for the
device. In this way, a device that is lacking a power source can be
activated, with the amount of Psi points being commensurate with
the size of the device to be activated:

Device Type Additional Psi Points required
Inefficient, power-hungry, small
device (say TL <6)

2

Inefficient, power-hungry, large
device (say TL <6)

4

Efficient, power-hungry, small
device (say TL <6)

1

Efficient, power-hungry, large
device (say TL <6)

2

Efficient, power-moderate small
device (TL >6)

0

Efficient, power-moderate large
device (TL >6)

1

The Effect of the roll determines the duration, in hours, that the
psion can power the device as long as physical contact can be
maintained.

Note that very large devices, such as large vehicles and starships,
cannot be influenced by Electrokinesis as they have energy
requirements greater then a psion can supply.

Energy Kinesis, Psionic Strength, 10-60 seconds, Average (+0).
Costs 2.

LUMINOKINESIS


Luminokinesis is the mental manipulation of light waves – both
visible and invisible. With a successful use of the power, the psion
can:

- Bend or refract light to create an illusion or distraction.
- Disrupt or interfere with visible light, such as a laser, reducing
    its damage.
- Create pockets of shadow or illumination.

Bend/Refract Light: This use of the power creates a distracting
optical illusion that imposes a negative DM equal to the Effect of
the roll on skills relying on sight used by outside observers.

Disrupt Light: This use of the power reduces the damage inflicted
by a visible light beam or bolt by the number of Psi points invested
in the power. The amount of Psi points being invested in the power
must be declared before any weapon damage is rolled.

Pockets of Shadow or Illumination: This power can be used at
range, diverting light to or from the target area. The amount of Psi
points invested creates either a positive or negative DM to skill
use, depending on the circumstances, to all within the radius of the
affected area. The Psi point investment has the following effects:

Psi Points Shadow or Illumination Effect
1 Dimming or slight increase in available light
2 Equivalent of twilight or a bright, dawn
3 Equivalent to night-time or a bright, sunny day
4 Absolute darkness or blinding brilliance

Energy Kinesis, Psionic Strength, 10-60 seconds, Difficult (–2).
Costs 2+Variable, depending on effect.

THERMOKINESIS


By influencing the substance of an object the character can raise or
lower its temperature, which may cause it to burst into flames or
even freeze. Roll 1d6 and add the Effect of the check.

Thermokinesis Effect Target...

0-4 Becomes warmer or cooler but is undamaged.
5-8 Is burned or severely frosted, suffering 1d6 damage.
9+ Suffers 2d6 damage and may burst into flame if
flammable or freeze if a freezable substance.

Where temperature in an organic creature is reduced and the Effect
is 5+, the Referee may rule that hypothermia results. Hypothermia
is the reduction of the body's operating temperature and it does
not require a large drop in temperature for hypothermia to have a
profound effect.

PORTALS AND NON-PSIONS
Any portal between dimensions with a Barrier Strength of 0 can be
passed through freely by both psions and non-psions. If a psion
can overcome a portal's Barrier Strength he can take through a
number of individuals equal to his Psi DM, increasing this by an
additional person for every Psi point he expended per trip.

Referees can, of course, relax this rule if inter-dimensional travel
is integral to the campaign.

PSIONIC POWERS PPSIONICSIONIC P POWERSOWERS



Once hypothermia takes hold, the only cure is to gradually warm the
body again, through a steady and gentle application of heat through
blankets, warm drinks and shelter. Hypothermia occurs in stages:

Stage 1
Body Temperature drops by 1-2°C below normal temperature (35-36°C). Mild to strong shivering occurs. The victim is unable to
perform complex tasks with the hands as they become numb.
Breathing becomes quick and shallow. Goose bumps form, raising
body hair on end in an attempt to create an insulating layer of air
around the body (which is of limited use in humans due to lack
of sufficient hair but useful in other species). Often, a person will
experience a warm sensation, as if they have recovered but they are
in fact heading into Stage 2.

Stage 2
Body temperature drops by 2-4°C. Shivering becomes more violent.
Muscle mis-coordination becomes apparent. Movements are slow
and laboured, accompanied by a stumbling pace and mild confusion,
although the victim may appear alert. The victim becomes pale. Lips,
ears, fingers and toes may become blue.

Stage 3
Body temperature drops below approximately 32°C. Shivering usually
stops. The character has difficulty speaking, sluggish thinking and
amnesia starts to manifest; inability to use hands and stumbling is
also present. Below 30°C, the exposed skin becomes blue and puffy,
muscle coordination becomes very poor, walking becomes almost
impossible and the victim exhibits incoherent/irrational behaviour.
Major organs fail and clinical death occurs – although, because
of decreased cellular activity, the body will actually take longer to
undergo brain death.

The Referee needs to determine the movement through each stage,
depending on the local conditions. However, without warmth or
shelter, the degeneration can be rapid with no more than a few
hours between each stage.

Characters suffering from Stage 1 hypothermia halve their physical
attributes. All physical skills suffer a –1 DM in addition to any
negative DMs from the reduction of physical characteristics. If
warmth is not applied within 1+1d3 hours, Stage 2 results.

Characters suffering from Stage 2 hypothermia reduce all physical
characteristics to 1. If warmth and shelter cannot be found within
1d3 hours, then Stage 3 results.

In Stage 3, the character is unable to move and death will result
within 1d3 hours unless both medical treatment and warmth/shelter
can be found.

Energy Kinesis, Psionic Strength, 10-60 seconds, Difficult (–2).
Costs 3+Range.

Machine Symbiosis
Machine symbiosis powers allow psions to interact with machines
fitted with a Psionic Interface, available at TL 14+.

Psionic Interface (TL 14): Any weapon or technological device can
be outfitted with a Psionic Interface. A character using a device with
a psionic interface can use his Psionic Strength DM instead of his
Dexterity DM when using the weapon or device; a character without
psionic ability gains no benefit from the interface. The character
must either touch the device or use telekinesis to interact with it at
range. Adding a Psionic Interface increases the cost of the device
by 20%.

The powers of this talent allow a trained psion to go beyond simply
substituting their Psi DM; the specifics of the talent are discussed
in the description of each power.

INTERROGATE


The psion can 'communicate' psychically with a machine,
determining its physical state of repair, properties, age, programming
and so forth. The psion effectively reads the psychometric aura that
accompanies every device in much the same way that an organic
aura can be read (although machines have no specific aura). The
Effect of the Machine Symbiosis roll determines the depth and
extent of the information but it does not provide any measure of
control.

Sample information available through the Communication power:

- Who made the machine, when and where.
- Specific functions.
- Hidden functions.
- Specific/hidden instructions or programming.
- State of repair/damage.
- Amount of power available in batteries.

Any machine that is fitted with a Psionic Interface offers no resistance
to Interrogation. However, anti-Interrogation software can be fitted
to a device, limiting the ability of psionic communication. Every
strength of anti-interrogation built into the interface is applied as a
–1 DM to the psion's skill roll, increasing the device's cost by 2%.

If a device has no Psionic Interface, a psion may still attempt to
interrogate the machine but at a standard –2 DM.

Machine Symbiosis, Psionic Strength, 1-6 Minutes, Average (+0 but
with modifiers for anti-interrogation, if present).
Costs: 2.

CONTROL


The psion is able to control a machine's functions, overriding
fixed settings, program routines and so forth. Machines can be
switched on or off and their functions changed, as long as the device
is capable of performing the instruction the psion gives to it. The

PPSIONICSIONIC P POWERSOWERS PSIONIC POWERS



Effect of the Machine Symbiosis roll indicates the degree of success
of the attempt to control the machine; lower Effects reflect a partial
control over function, whilst higher effects reflect total control of it.
Only one instruction at a time can be given to a machine.

As with machines that are shielded against interrogation, so can
they be shielded against Control. Every level of anti-Control strength
applies a –1 DM to the psion's control attempt (and adds 2% to the
machine's cost).

Machines with no Psionic Interface apply a standard –2 DM to the
Control attempt.

_Machine Symbiosis, Psionic Strength, 10-60 Minutes, Average (+0 but
with modifiers for anti-interrogation, if present).
Costs: 3._

lasting for the physical activity being undertaken. If Athletics is not
possessed as a skill, then the first 2 Psi points provides the psion
with a skill level of 0.

As the Acrobatics skill is divided into specializations (see Traveller
Core Rulebook , page 52), the psion must declare which specialization
he is intending to achieve through his skill augmentation.

Personal Enhancement, Psionic Strength, 1-6 seconds, Average (+0).
Costs: 2 points per 1 level of Athletics skill.

ENHANCED ART


Through entering a trance-like state, for every 2 Psi points invested,
the character's Art skill is temporarily increased by 1 level, with
the duration of the power lasting for the physical activity being
undertaken. If Art is not possessed as a skill, then the first 2 Psi
points provides the psion with a skill level of 0.

As the Art skill is divided into specializations (see Traveller Core
Rulebook , page 52), the psion must declare which specialization he
is intending to achieve through his skill augmentation.

Personal Enhancement, Psionic Strength, Variable depending on
activity, Average (+0).
Costs: 2 points per 1 level of Art skill.

ENHANCED CHARISMA


The psion uses his psychic powers to enhance his personal charisma
when dealing with others, no matter what the circumstances. For
every 2 Psi points invested, the character temporarily increases
either Broker, Deception, Diplomat or Persuade by 1 level with the
duration of the power lasting for the activity being undertaken. If the
skill in question is not possessed as a skill, then the first 2 Psi points
provides the psion with a skill level of 0.

Personal Enhancement, Psionic Strength, Variable depending on
activity, Average (+0).
Costs: 2 points per 1 level of skill.

Projection
Through this talent the psion projects various parts of his psyche
outside the confines of his body. The most common manifestation
of the talent is Out of Body Experience, which may also be known as
astral projection or astral travelling but the talent also governs the
powers of projecting emotions and the entire personality.

OUT OF BODY EXPERIENCE


The psion's psyche leaves the body and is able to travel for a
distance determined by the Psionic Range table on page 55 (using
the Telepathy column). The speed of travel is as fast or as slow as
the psion wishes it be and can be instantaneous, as long as the
time limit for the experience is not exceeded. Using this power
the psyche can thus travel great (but not interplanetary) distances.
Whilst in the OBE state the psion cannot physically interact with his

Personal Enhancement
Through this talent the psion uses his psychic energy to enhance
certain physical capabilities, in much the same way that Psionic
Strength points are used to augment Strength and Dexterity.

ENHANCED ACROBATICS

surroundings and is invisible to mundane sight – although his aura
travels with him and may thus be seen by aura-aware psions.

The psion can remain in an OBE state for up to 30 minutes, plus a
further 15 minutes equal to every point of his Psionic Strength DM.
If the psion does not return to his body within this period, he is
forced to snap back to consciousness and must throw Psi + End 9+
to avoid incurring one level of Psionic Trauma.

Projection, Psionic Strength, 30 minutes +15 minutes per point of Psi
DM, Average (+0).
Costs: 2 points plus range.

PROJECT PERSONALITY


The psion creates a psychic representation of his personality
and appearance that visibly appears before others. The power is
ranged, so the psion can project his personality over great but not
interplanetary, distances. If the psion spends an additional Psi point
when projecting his personality, audible communication projection
can also be attained, although the psion will not be able to hear
any offered response; neither can the psion see the area that his
personality is projected to.

Project Personality works best when the psion has visited or can
visualise, the place he is projecting to. If he cannot, he suffers a –2
DM to the skill roll.

Projection, Psionic Strength, 10-60 seconds, Difficult (–2).
Costs: 4 plus range (+1 point for added verbal projection).

PROJECT EMOTION


The psion is able to project his emotions into the psyche of another.
The target only experiences the same emotional state as that being
experienced by the psion and, unless the target is a willing recipient
of the projection, he resists the projection attempt with his Int DM (if positive). The Effect of the psion's Project Emotion determines
the intensity of the emotional experience felt by the target; an Effect
of 0 or 1 indicates that the target feels the emotions at the same
intensity as the psion; a higher Effect indicates a more intense
emotional experience for the target.

The target must be in line of sight for the projection to be effective.

The emotional state lasts for between 10 and 60 minutes, during
this period the target will act according to the emotions being
experienced.

Projection, Psionic Strength, 10-60 minutes, Difficult (–2).
Costs: 3 plus range.

GLAMOUR


This power allows the psion to project a subtle distraction within a
radius in meters equal to the number of Psi points invested in the
power. Those within the radius cease to pay the psion any attention,

completely forgetting his presence, becoming temporarily distracted
by something else: for the brief duration of the Glamour, the psion
becomes, effectively, invisible, edited-out of the short-term memory
of those affected.

Projection, Psionic Strength, 1-6 rounds, Difficult (–2).
Costs: 1 per meter of radius.

Psionic Attack
The ability to use the mind as a weapon has long interested those
researchers who want to see how far the mind can be pushed.
Although some psionic attacks (and, correspondingly, defences)
form part of the Telepathy talent, dedicated training in psionic
attacks form their own talent, with the psion being trained in using
his mental capabilities for violent purposes.

Most psionic attacks are based on meting-out either physical or
mental trauma and involve a variable Psi expenditure. A powerful
psion can inflict large amounts of damage without even having to
touch his intended victim.

PAIN


The psion overloads the pain receptors of his intended victim with
psychic energy, causing either great or subtle pain to flood the
target's body. The pain attack causes no lasting physical damage
but whilst it is being experienced the victim may believe that his
entire body is being mentally shredded, such is the intense agony.

The psion decides how many Psi points he wishes to invest in the
attack. This number acts as a negative DM to all skills the target
tries to use, including characteristic DMs, for the duration of the
attack. The Effect of the skill roll determines the duration of the pain
felt by the target:

0 1-6 seconds
1 1-6 rounds
2 1-6 minutes
3 10-60 minutes
4 1-6 hours

Psionic Attack, Psionic Strength, Variable, Difficult (–2)
Costs: Variable, plus range.

PARALYSIS


Paralysis inflicts no pain but it renders the target immobile for a
period dependent on the Effect of the attack. The Psi cost is variable,
with specific parts of the body costing differing amounts:

Hand/Foot 1 point
Arm/Leg 2 points (includes hand and foot)
Neck 2 points
Chest/Shoulders 3 points
Torso 3 points
Head 3 points

PPSIONICSIONIC P POWERSOWERS PSIONIC POWERS



Thus, to completely paralyse a person, ensuring no mobility of
any kind, it would require 15 Psi points. A paralysed location is
unable to move and remains locked in position for the duration of
the paralysis. This may result in the target falling prone, toppling
over and so forth, depending on local conditions. The paralysis
does not prevent breathing or blood flow but if the head or neck
are targeted, vocal chords, jaws, lips and mouth will be paralysed,
vastly restricting communication.

The Effect of the skill roll determines the duration of the paralysis:

0 1-6 seconds
1 1-6 rounds
2 1-6 minutes
3 10-60 minutes
4 1-6 hours

_Psionic Attack, Psionic Strength, Variable, Difficult (–2).
Costs: Variable, plus range._

MIND BLAST


A more powerful version of the Telekinetic Punch power, Mind Blast
delivers an extremely powerful shockwave of psionic energy either
at a specific target or to a number of targets within a specific radius.
The psion must specify which way he is directing the power.

If directed at a specific target, the Mind Blast delivers 3d6 + Effect
damage for every 2 Psi invested in the power.

If used to affect an area, 2d6 + Effect damage is delivered to _every_
living thing in a radius of 1 meter for every 1 Psi invested in the
power.

Damage is directed as any physical damage, being applied to Str,
Dex and End.

_Psionic Attack, Psionic Strength, Variable, Difficult (–2).
Costs: Variable, plus range._

MIND SHOCK


Mind Shock is used against other psions and is designed to deliver
Psionic Trauma rather than immediate damage. If the attack is
successful, the target psion sustains 1 level of Psionic Trauma, plus
an additional level equal to the Effect of the attack. The defending
psion may use his own Psionic Strength DM as a negative DM
against the attacker's roll.

_Psionic Attack, Psionic Strength, Variable, Average (+0).
Costs: 3, plus range._

UNLOCK


The Unlock power uses the subconscious of the target as the weapon.
The psion unlocks those parts of the brain where nightmares,
fears and dark secrets are stored, filling the target's psyche with

nightmarish visions, uncontrollable terror, paralysing panic attacks
or deep-seated guilt. The target's Int + Psi DMs act against the psion
as a negative DM but if the attack is successful, the target suffers
a negative DM to all skills equal to the Psi points invested in the
attack, for a period determined by the Effect of the attack:

0 1-6 seconds
1 1-6 rounds
2 1-6 minutes
3 10-60 minutes
4 1-6 hours

In this time the target is clearly disturbed, agitated, unable to
concentrate, hyperventilates and suffers hallucinations as his own
mind battles against him.

Psionic Attack, Psionic Strength, Variable, Average (+0).
Costs: Variable, plus range.

Psionic Defence
Defensive psionics are trained in mitigating offensive psionics
using a variety of active and passive techniques as described in the
powers associated with this talent. Although Psionic Defence is the
natural counterpart to Psionic Attack, it does not necessarily follow
that all combat psions study defence – or that all defensive psionics
are necessarily peaceful.

MIND BLANK


The psion turns his mind into a blank void that cannot be detected
by other psions, even those who are aura-aware. The power renders

PSIONIC POWERS PPSIONICSIONIC P POWERSOWERS



the psion immune to any psionic attacks for the duration of the
Mind Blank but neither can he exercise his own psionic powers.
Every Psi point invested in the power increases the duration of the
Mind Blank by a number of minutes equal to his Int characteristic.

Psionic Defence, Psionic Strength, Int in minutes, Average (+0).
Costs: 1.

MIND MIRROR


This powerful ability turns the psion's mind into a mirror, reflecting
any psionic attack back at the attacker. It is, however, dangerous
as the defending psion does not know how many Psi points will be
required to make Mind Mirror effective.

The power works by matching the incoming Psionic Strength points
invested in the attack and reversing the energy flow towards the
attacker. If the Mind Mirror power is invoked successfully, the
attacking psion suffers the effects of the attack, as long as the
defending psion as able to match the Psi points invested in the
attack and exceed them by at least 1 point.

If a defending psion uses Mind Mirror against passive psionic
powers (i.e. those that do not inflict damage in some form but may
be concerned with detection and information retrieval) then the
attacking psion receives information reflecting his own, personal
state – which may or may not act to confuse or confound.

Psionic Defence, Psionic Strength, 1-6 seconds, Difficult (–2).
Costs: 1+Psi Points of attacking power.

PSYCHIC ARMOR


Psychic Armor places a psionic barrier in front of the psion's mind,
absorbing damage from psionic attacks in the same way physical
armor protects against physical damage. The amount of damage
reduced is equal to the Psi points invested in the power.

Psionic Defence, Psionic Strength, 1-6 seconds, Average (+0).
Costs: 1, per point of damage defended.

PSYCHIC ABSORPTION


This power works in exactly the same way as Psychic Armor but
the defending psion absorbs the Psi points charging the attack
and places them at his own disposal. Any excess Psi points act as
damage as per the nature of the attack.

Psionic Defence, Psionic Strength, 1-6 seconds, Difficult (–2).
Costs: 1 per point of damage absorbed.

Ship Integration
This is a discrete and highly specialized talent akin to Machine
Symbiosis but concerned solely with influencing the control of
starships. These complex vessels require special minds and special
training especially when it comes to augmenting starship movement.
The Mind Ships chapter, starting on page 89, provides more detail

on the equipment necessary for Ship Integration but essentially the
talent calls for one or more psions to become a physical part of the
ship's fabric, connecting directly to its control and drive systems and
using their psionic powers to influence its performance. Such a high
degree of integration may come at a cost: Ship Integrated psions
may have to commit to surgical procedures to become wired-in to
the complex interfaces necessary for the talent to work, although
such extremes are naturally dependent on the nature of the Traveller
campaign.

Ship Integrated psions may, of course, train in other talents; the
question is whether or not they will have the Psionic Strength
reserves to use them. It may thus be the case that a starship that
relies on psionic augmentation has several psions working as a team
to pool their power and talents. Of course, a single psion can run all
the necessary functions but risks both psionic power overload and
Psionic Trauma in doing so.

FOLD SPACE


Starships are simply too large to be teleported. However, space/
time can be manipulated to facilitate ship movement between two
points. Space is literally folded; a portal opened between the fold
and the ship moved through it, achieving travel distances akin to
those achieved using Jump drives or other FTL engines or jump
gates. However, the distances that can be achieved through folding
space are dependent on both the ship's tonnage and the psionic
reserves of the integrated psion.

The maximum tonnage any psion can move through folded space is
equal to his Psionic Strength multiplied by 100. Thus, a psion with a
Psi of 7 could move a maximum of 700 tons hull displacement.

The distance travelled depends on how much space is folded. Every
2 Psi points used to fold space creates a jump distance of 1; so, to
achieve the equivalent of Jump 3, it would require 6 Psi points and
a successful Ship Integration roll to achieve it. A ship powered in
this way does not require a Jump or FTL drive, however it does need
a Maneuver drive to shift through folded space and emerge at its
destination. Theoretically, Fold Space travel can be instantaneous;
however, as this may not suit all campaign types, it is at the
Referee's discretion if instantaneous travel is possible ('travelling
without moving'). However, one rule that is easily applied is that
the Effect of the psion's Ship Integration roll is deducted from the
equivalent, conventional travelling time. So, for example, a standard
Traveller ship using a Jump engine would occupy one week in Jump
space, regardless of the length of the jump; a psion who folds space
with an Effect of 3 would decrease the travel time from 7 to 4 days.
Another alternative is to rule that 1 Jump equals 1 day of elapsed
time, a Jump 6 fold would result in 6 days of elapsed travel time.

A psion can work in tandem with a Jump drive to achieve long
distance jumps but the two cannot be applied together. Thus, a
psion could not fold space for a Jump 4 equivalent, with the ship's
Jump 4 drive also being spun-up to achieve Jump 8. Instead, either

PPSIONICSIONIC P POWERSOWERS PSIONIC POWERS



the fold or conventional jump must first be completed before the
second way of travelling is used.

FOLD SPACE DMS


Integrated psions are still subject to certain DMs when attempting
to fold space. Preparing for and initiating the fold, takes 10-60
minutes; DMs are applied for emergency or unprepared folds, along
with other factors:

Factor DM
For every 200 tons of hull displacement –1
Immediate fold without preparation –3
Within a hundred-diameter limit –8
Ship is under attack –2
Ship is returning fire –1
Psion has already folded space within the previous 24 hours –1

MISJUMPS THROUGH FOLDED SPACE


If a psion fails his Ship Integration roll and applied DMs take the
result to 0 then a misjump occurs, exactly as if a misjump has
occurred as described on page 141 of the _Traveller Core Rulebook_. If
the dice roll is a failure of 1 or more, then the psion has simply failed
to fold space effectively and may re-attempt the fold roll (having lost
1 Psi point in the process).

_Ship Integration, Psionic Strength, 10-60 minutes, Average (+0).
Costs: 2 per Jump 1 equivalent._

DRIVE AUGMENTATION


This power enables a psion to augment the capabilities of a
conventional J or M drive. He does not fold space but provides
psionic power to increase the ship's speed whilst the conventional
drives are used, resulting in reduced fuel usage.

Every 2 Psi points used to augment an operating drive increases
the ship's jump range by 1 or its Thrust by 1. Every 200 tons of hull
displacement imposes a –1 DM to the Ship Integration roll, which must
be made to successfully augment the drive in use. When used with a
Jump drive, the amount of time spent in jump space is not decreased
by the Effect of the roll; only the range is influenced. The same DMs as
those used for Fold Space are applied when augmenting a drive.

_Ship Integration, Psionic Strength, 10-60 minutes, Average (+0).
Costs: 2 per Jump or Thrust 1 equivalent._

FAR SEEING


This power assists with Astrogation checks prior to a jump being made
or space folded. The psion projects his mind through the astrogation
sensors, either plotting a course or assisting an existing Astrogator.
On a successful use of the power the psion either gains a DM equal to
the Effect of the roll when folding space or adds the Effect of the roll to
any Astrogation roll being made by a dedicated navigator. The cost for
Far Seeing is 1 Psi point for every Jump 1 equivalent.

Ship Integration, Psionic Strength, 10-60 minutes, Average (+0).
Costs: 1 per Jump 1 equivalent.

SHIP OPERATION ENHANCEMENT


Being integrated with a ship's control systems, a psion can enhance
engineering, maintenance and combat activities. An integrated psion
can therefore add his Psionic Strength DM to any of the following
skills at no Psi point cost: Engineer (all), Gunner (all), Mechanic, Pilot (all), Remote Operations and Sensors. This zero-point enhancement
still requires a successful Ship Integration roll.

However, if the integrated psion wishes or it is needed, he may spend
a further 2 Psi points to increase the skill roll by +1. Multiple skills
can be augmented simultaneously, as long as the psion has the Psi
points to fund the operations; however, each additional operation
being augmented imposes a –1 DM to the integrated psion's Ship
Integration roll.

Ship Integration, Psionic Strength, variable, –1 per additional augmented
operation above the first.
Costs: 2 per +1 to skill level.

Tapping
Psions who are trained in tapping use their powers to draw in their
own physical characteristics to augment their Psionic Strength
and, commonly, the characteristics of others, functioning almost
as psychic vampires. The tapping of others can lead to a psion
developing large Psi point reserves but such individuals, in addition
to the fear that surrounds their vampiric tendencies, tend be viewed
with deep suspicion by other psions who are prepared to rely on
conventional reserves and regeneration.

Tapping is therefore a powerful and feared talent, its practitioners
often pariahs in both the psion and mundane communities.

TAP SELF


The psion taps one of his characteristics, transforming the electrical
energy into usable Psi points. Every characteristic point tapped
generates 1 Psi point. All characteristics, with the exceptions of
Education and Social, may be tapped and as a characteristic is
weakened, the physical capabilities associated with it diminish
accordingly. Heavily tapping Endurance, for instance, lowers the
ability to withstand physical trauma and disease; tapping Dexterity
reduces agility and co-ordination; tapping Intelligence reduces the
ability to concentrate, reason and act rationally.

To tap a characteristic the psion simply needs to succeed in a
Tapping roll, gaining the additional Psi points immediately: there is
no limit on the number of characteristic points that can be tapped.
However the physical effects of tapping take an immediate toll and,
if a characteristic reaches zero, the psion is rendered incapacitated
as per the damage rules found in the Traveller Core Rulebook.

PSIONIC POWERS PPSIONICSIONIC P POWERSOWERS



Tapping, Psionic Strength, 1-6 seconds, Average (+0).
Costs: 1 Characteristic point.

TAP OTHER


This power works in exactly the same way as Tap Self. However,
the tapping psion suffers a DM equal to the characteristic DM of
the characteristic he is attempting to leach. The psion must also be
in physical contact with the target and cannot tap more than half (round down) of the targeted characteristic in a single attempt.

Tapping, Psionic Strength, 1-6 seconds minus Target Characteristic
DM.
Costs: 1 Characteristic point from target.

TAP EMOTION


Instead of tapping physical characteristics, the psion instead uses
emotional energy, transferring it into himself and converting it to
Psionic Strength. The psion must target another individual and
cannot tap his own emotions; and he must be in physical contact
with the target.

The power only works with powerful, deeply-affecting emotions such
as love, hate, fear, anger and envy. Someone in a 'normal' placid
state cannot be affected. The Referee should assign the emotion with
a strength of between 2 and 12, reflecting the depth of feeling. All
consuming anger, for instance, would warrant a strength of 12, whilst
mild jealousy only 3 or 4. The strength of the emotion is the limit that
the psion can tap. Tapping emotions has its own difficulties, so there
are no DMs for the emotion's strength and as the emotion is tapped
its strength decreases in proportion with what the psion leaches.
Thus, a psion could use this power to transform an all-consuming
rage into mild anger; or sap a target of his deep, abiding love.

Tapping, Psionic Strength, 10-60 seconds, Difficult (–2).
Costs: 1 Emotional Strength from Target.

MIND SWITCH


This power allows the psion to swap minds with another. Physical
contact must be maintained as the switch occurs.

The target applies his Int DM as a negative DM to the psion's mind
switch attempt and the cost in Psi points is equal to half the subject's
Int, rounded up. Once swapped, the psion's mind occupies and
controls that of the subject's body and vice versa. The psion has no
access to the memories or experiences of the subject but does take
on the physical characteristics. Therefore, the psion and subject
swap Int and Edu characteristics but retain Str, Dex and End.

The mind switch has a safe limit of a number of hours equal to the
Effect of the roll, multiplied by the result of a 2d6 throw. If the psion
does not swap minds back at the end of this time, both he and the
subject begin to accrue 1 level of Psionic Trauma for each six hour
period thereafter.

Tapping, Psionic Strength, 10-60 Seconds, Difficult (–2).
Costs: Int of subject, divided by 2.

Temporal Manipulation
The Temporal Manipulation talent primarily concerns travelling
in time, forwards or backwards or manipulating the flow of the
timestream. Allowing this talent depends completely on whether
or not time travel is a necessary part of the campaign (as it is in
Judge Dredd or Strontium Dog campaigns, for example); and, even
then, some decisions need to be made as to the nature of time and
how temporal paradoxes are handled (see the nearby boxed text for
some guidance in this area).

Temporal Manipulation is therefore a very powerful talent. The
ability to influence time – stopping it, speeding it up, changing the
past to influence the future – can have profound implications for
the characters and the campaign. The detailed implications are
beyond the scope of this book but are discussed at a high level in
the descriptions of the individual powers.

The Temporal Manipulation talent assumes that time can be
influenced psionically; that the powers of the mind can shape the
fabric of time. It presupposes that certain individuals are fluid in
time, being able to use their powers to move backwards or forwards
through sheer force of will rather than having to rely on time machines

- although temporal science may be significantly understood to
permit time machines to exist alongside such psions.

PPSIONICSIONIC P POWERSOWERS PSIONIC POWERS



The powers in this talent therefore need to be considered carefully. A great
deal of enjoyment can be had with time travel, however this will impose
a certain burden on the Referee in adjudicating just how profound the
effects are and how powerful the psion characters can become.

TIME SHIFT


This is the power of time travel – the ability to move forwards or
backwards through time.

The direction and degree of movement must always be specified
by the time shifter before the Temporal Manipulation roll is made.
Every Time Shift is a Very Difficult (–4) task but additional modifiers
are applied, as noted below.

The degree of travel – how far, forwards or backwards – depends on
the number of Psi points invested in the shift, as described in the
table below:

Degree Base Psi Cost
Seconds 1
Rounds 2
Minutes 4
Hours 6
Days 8
Weeks 10
Months 12
Years 14
Decades 16
Centuries 18
Millennia 20

At the Base Psi Cost the psion moves 1d6 units of that increment.
Moving an additional 1d6 requires an additional Psi Cost equal to
half the Base Cost. So, moving 1d6 hours forwards or backwards
costs 6 Psi; moving 2d6 costs 9 Psi and so forth.

If the character wants to travel to a precise point in time, then he may
attempt to do so but increases the difficulty to Formidable (–6).

MOVING ADDITIONAL PEOPLE AND CARGO


A psion can time shift with no difficulty when wearing clothing and
carrying personal items that can be easily carried on the back, in the
hands, in pockets and so forth. Large and bulky items increase the
Time Shift Psi cost; it costs an additional 1 Psi point to transport up

to 100 kilograms (2 Psi points for up to 200 kg and so forth). The
psion must have physical contact with the object at the moment the
Time Shift is executed.

If the psion wishes to take additional people with him, he can extend
the range of his Time Shift field to encompass a 1 meter radius for
every additional Psi point invested in the shift. However, he suffers a
–1 DM to the Temporal Manipulation roll for every individual within
the area of effect.

Temporal Manipulation, Psionic Strength, Very Difficult (–4).
Cost: dependent on degree of time travel.

THE PHYSICS OF TIME SHIFTING


If one applies hard and fast physics to Time Shifting – i.e. moving
in time but not in space – then every Time Shift would end in
tragedy. Any body in motion – planets, starships, vehicles – do
not remain fixed in space. Even a time shift of a few minutes
sees a moving body progress along its orbit or course meaning
that, when the time traveller appears, at the same spatial point,
his point of origin will have moved onwards, with the potential
that the time traveller is immediately exposed to the vacuum of
space (and an almost instant death). Indeed, this very notion
forms the basis of some science fiction weapons, most notably
the devastating Time Bomb from Strontium Dog.

Unless one wishes to apply physics in this way, it is therefore
assumed that the Time Shift power also moves the time traveller
in both space and time, so that he remains synchronised with
his surroundings.

TIME FREEZE


Using this power the psion freezes time, yet is unfrozen himself.
Time can only be frozen for short periods; 1d6 seconds per Psi
point invested in the power. For each additional Psi point invested
the psion can extend the unfrozen bubble by 1 meter radius, with
anyone within that radius remaining unfrozen.

During the time freeze characters are at liberty to make changes to
the environment based on common sense principles. For instance,
moving a tank that is frozen in time requires driving it and, as its

PSIONIC POWERS PSIONIC POWERS



mechanisms will be frozen in time, it cannot be moved unless the
psion extends the range of the unfrozen bubble to include it (which
would also unfreeze any occupants). Ultimately the Referee will
need to arbitrate on what can and cannot be interfered with.

At the end of the freeze period, time immediately resumes with any
changes taking whatever effect they will have on whatever actions
were being performed before the freeze.

Temporal Manipulation, Psionic Strength, Variable, Very Difficult (–4).
Cost: 1 point per 1d6 seconds of frozen time plus 1 point per meter radius
extended.

PARADOX ADJUSTMENT


Changing time can result in all manner of paradoxes: accidentally
killing a wasp in the past my irrevocably alter the course of the
future, for instance. This power allows the psion to rectify a known
paradox my subtly influencing the fabric of time so that potentially
catastrophic changes are mitigated and the future remains,
essentially, on its previous course.

The Referee should assign any potential paradox a strength of
between 2 and 12, with 2 being a very minor 'blip' and 12 being a
catastrophic change to future events. To correct the paradox the
psion must spend a number of Psi points equal to the paradox's
strength and make a successful Temporal Manipulation roll. If
successful, then the paradox is either completely mitigated or its
strength (and therefore consequences) reduced by the amount of
Psi points used.

Temporal Manipulation, Psionic Strength, Very Difficult (–4).
Cost: Variable, depending on the strength of the paradox.

HANDLING TEMPORAL PARADOX


Any campaign involving time travel must address the nature of paradox: the ability to influence the past with the possibility that the
future is changed, leading to anomalies that would negate (completely or partially) the actions and existence of those who created the
change – meaning that the change, in the first place, might become impossible.

The Referee needs to decide on the nature of time in order to explain, resolve or avoid the question of paradox. This book cannot go
into detail on the subject but some options for consideration are presented here:

Mutable Time
The past can be altered but certain alterations may result in the character's present and future being altered in accordance with that
change. The change might be so profound that the characters cannot return to their present because, the present they left, has simply
ceased to exist. The best illustration of this is the character who travels back in time and does something that prevents him from being
born (killing his great, great grandfather, for example). In the present he would no longer exist and so time changes to compensate.
The character might therefore find himself stranded in the past, because he cannot exist in the future or he might be erased from time
altogether (literally disappearing) because he should not exist at all. This is an extreme measure and, perhaps, the most realistic (given
the overall realism of time travel in the first place).

PSIONIC POWERS



The Bradbury Effect
Here, any change, no matter how tiny, reverberates through the timestreams like ripples of water on a still lake. Stepping on an insect in
the distant past has consequences that magnify through the timestreams, profoundly affecting the future in some way. The characters
still exist but their present is very different to the one they left, because they change they initiated has been profoundly magnified as
it has reverberated down through history. This is named the Bradbury Effect after Ray Bradbury's celebrated short story 'A Sound of
Thunder' in which the accidental death of a butterfly in Earth's prehistory vastly alters the future; the butterfly's contribution to the
ecology influenced whole ecosystems and without it, changes knock-on and amplify to the point that the character's future is totally
altered when they return. If using this as the basis for time travel, then the characters will need to find ways of isolating themselves from
interacting with the past in any way, shape or form, because even their mere presence could be damaging.

Time Forgives
The nature of time is one of constant adjustment; changes to the past result in time itself compensating for those changes to ensure
that the future maintains a predetermined course – much like a river flows around an obstacle, eddies but still ends-up at the sea. Any
changes the characters make have immediate and short-term consequences – and these may reverberate to the present – but essentially
the present remains unaltered. Killing one's great, great grandfather might mean that the character is born, as he is, to someone else:
time compensates to maintain continuity but with obvious consequences for the character's personal history – but not the flow of time
itself. This may be an 'unrealistic' way of portraying the nature of time but makes the handling of paradox much easier for the Referee.

Immutable Time
The past simply cannot be altered, no matter how small or great the intended change. Events will always intercede that prevent the
characters from altering the present. Assume that a character intends to kill his great, great grandfather; no matter what he does, time
exerts an influence to ensure that it cannot happen. The great, great grandfather miraculously survives or the character encounters
insurmountable obstacles to his plans. Time is fixed at _all_ points and although subtle attempts to change it might be exercised, they
never assume their intended effect.

Divergent Parallel Time
Changes in the past create a rift in the fabric of reality that creates a separate, alternate timeline. The characters might find their future
altered, however the alteration is a separate dimension created as a result of their actions. They can therefore either travel to an alternate
present or they may have access to the present they left behind by crossing the dimensional boundaries to reach the branch of time
where their interference never took place. This option therefore introduces parallel dimensions into the campaign, which may or may
not fit with the campaign's aims.

Intolerant Time
A similar concept to immutable time but any profound change that would impact significantly on the present sees the characters
automatically and perhaps traumatically, returned to their present at the instant the change is affected. Like a body rejecting a foreign
object, time enforces its nature when there is a sense of unequivocal alteration to its course. Characters might suddenly find themselves
expelled from the past, returning to the future and suffering Psionic Trauma as a result.

An Alternate Past
This is a variation on the Divergent Parallel Time concept. Travelling back in time also means travelling dimensionally: the past of the
characters is immutable and instead they can only reach a past that follows a parallel course to their own in which their effects can be
sustained. When they return to the present, they return to their own, unchanged, reality.

The Past Denied
Perhaps the most 'realistic' option, travel into the past is simply impossible and only travel into the future, because it is not yet a fixed
thing, can be achieved. Yet this, in itself, creates another paradox: if travel to the past is impossible, travel to the future immediately
locks the character into that timespace because his point of origin is denied to him.

Passive Observers
Any time traveller can only observe events but not interact with them. The characters do not physically travel in time but do so mentally,
able to watch events, yet do nothing to influence them. This option fits a psionic campaign quite neatly and prevents paradox from
occurring but limits characters' options to that of merely reporting them.

PSIONIC POWERS



### PPSIONICSIONIC T TRAUMARAUMA

Psions wield huge power, yet the ability to access the hidden
powers of the mind also leaves them vulnerable to the stresses
that inevitably accompany the use of such power: Psionic Trauma,
mental instability and a loss of sanity are all very real threats to an
active psion. The definitions of these conditions are as follows:

Psionic Trauma
Unleashing the powers of the subconscious mind risks damaging
the conscious mind and the personality. Even the most seasoned
psion is dealing with forces that can have a profound effect on
one's character and mental outlook. At its most basic level, Psionic
Trauma is a weakening of the mind to deal with the powers being
consciously channelled; as it grows, Psionic Trauma leads to a
weakening of the mind's immune system, exposing the psion to the
risk of mental illness and psychosis.

Mental Instability
At low levels, Psionic Trauma creates vulnerability to psychosis
and mental illness; at higher levels it paves the way for them. As
Psionic Trauma develops so does the chance of mental illness and
psychosis taking hold. Mental illnesses are conditions where the
character experiences a variety of mental and personality based
disorders but is still capable of functioning in society. Psychosis is a
severe form of mental instability in which all contact with reality is
lost. Psychotics are very often delusional, deeply paranoid, unable
or unwilling to engage with others and very often shrink within
themselves as a way of defending their fragile minds from both
external and internal pressures.

Insanity
The most extreme form of psychosis is insanity – a permanent state
of psychosis manifesting itself in any number of states but which
make them, characteristically, a danger to themselves and others.
Insanity is not irreversible but it is a hardened psychotic state that
may go unnoticed for years by others but continually wounds the
sufferer.

THE CONDITIONS IN GAME TERMS


Traveller psions may go through the process of mental collapse in
the following order:

- Low Psionic Trauma
- Medium Level Psionic Trauma
- High Level Psionic Trauma
- Mental Instability
- Insanity

Psions suffering from Psionic Trauma experience restrictions to
their talents and powers in the form of negative DMs and increased
Psi Strength costs. As levels of trauma build, mental instability is

risked; once a psion becomes mentally unstable, it can then be a
rapid descent into insanity, if the condition is left untreated.

Mental Instability and Insanity are difficult to quantify in game
terms, although attempts are made to do so. More importantly,
both conditions should be treated as behaviours to be expressed
through roleplaying rather than dice and statistics-based mechanics.
Extreme changes in personality cannot be satisfactorily dealt with
as DMs; instead, they should be treated seriously by players and
Referees as a way of running the character – if indeed the character
should be run at all. A deeply disturbed or insane character might be
better handled as a Non-Player Character or retired from a campaign
altogether.

Psionic Trauma
As already outlined, Psionic Trauma is effectively mental damage,
which leaves a character exposed to a deteriorating mental state.
Psionic Trauma is not, in itself, an insanity; it is a weakening of the
mental immune system that can lead to infections building, creating
illness.

There are a maximum of six levels of Psionic Trauma before Mental
Instability takes hold. Psionic Trauma is accrued, level by level,
when:

- The Int characteristic is reduced to half its current level through
    psionic damage.
- Powers are used in rapid succession.
- Psionic Strength points are exceeded.
- The character undergoes a traumatic mental or emotional
    experience, such as being possessed or experiencing the death
    of a loved one.
- Sudden or prolonged exposure to a stressful environment.

LOSING INT


If Int is reduced to half its current level as a result of damage inflicted
by a psionic attack or through other means, one level of Psionic
Trauma is accrued. Psionic Trauma is not removed when Int regains
its former level; it can only be treated through medical means. If Int
is reduced to zero, two levels of Psionic Trauma are gained.

POWERS ARE USED IN RAPID SUCCESSION


A character can use a single power or combination of powers, a
number of times per day (or 24 hour period) equal to half his Int
characteristic (rounded up). If this number is exceeded, he gains
a level of Psionic Trauma. If he uses his powers a number of times
equal to his Int, two levels are gained and so forth.

PSIONIC STRENGTH POINTS ARE EXCEEDED


Psions may use all their Psionic Strength points and draw upon the
Int and End characteristics to provide 'reserve' points on a like-for-

PPSIONICSIONIC T TRAUMARAUMA


PSIONIC TRAUMA



like basis. Reducing Int obviously incurs Psionic Trauma; reducing
Endurance does likewise and on the same basis: if Endurance is
reduced to half its current level through funding psionic powers, a
level of Psionic Trauma is accrued.

MENTAL OR EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE, EXPOSURE TO STRESS
These are circumstances where the Referee must adjudicate. Any
experience that might damage the mental or emotional state can
lead to Psionic Trauma. One way of handling this is to assign the
event an _Intensity_ of between 2 and 12 or roll for its intensity on
2d6. This is the target number, applying Int and Psionic Strength
DMs, that must be successfully rolled, to avoid a level of Psionic
Trauma being accrued. Alternatively, the Referee may decide that
a particular experience is so profound, stressful or shocking that a
level is accrued immediately.

EFFECTS OF PSIONIC TRAUMA


Each level of Psionic Trauma has the following game effects:

- Imposes a –1 DM to _all_ Psionic Talents
- Adds +1 to the Psi Strength when using a psionic power

_For example, Travis, has 2 Levels of Psionic Trauma and has Telepathy_

_1. When using Telepathy he suffers a –2 DM to his roll and any power
has +2 added to its Psionic Strength cost._

As previously stated, Psionic Trauma has a maximum of six levels
before Mental Instability becomes a real risk. The Psionic Trauma
table outlines how this works.

PSIONIC TRAUMA LEVELS

Trauma)

11+ Every Three Months

3-4 (Medium Level Psionic
Trauma)

9+ Every Month

5-6 (High Level Psionic

7+ Every Week

The traumatised psion must, at the stated period, roll 2d6 against
the Mental Instability target number. No DMs are applied. If the
target number is met or exceeded, then the character gains a Mental
Instability.

Treating Psionic Trauma
Psionic Trauma cannot be alleviated without treatment. The options
are as follows:

PSYCHIATRIC CARE


One month of dedicated psychiatric care and convalescence is
required per level of Psionic Trauma. At the end of the period, the
psion rolls Int 8+ with DMs for Medic and Life Sciences (Psychology)

skills (delivered through trained, psychiatric experts and staff). For
every additional month the psion remains in voluntary care, a further
+1 DM is applied. If the roll is successful, then the level of Psionic
Trauma is removed.

For example, Travis admits himself to the sanatorium on Sonares Prime.
He is suffering from 2 levels of Psionic Trauma and so his treatment
will take two months. His care team includes a psychologist with Life
Sciences (Psychology) 2. His Int is 7. Travis decides that he will stay for
three months, rather than just two, to ensure he emerges as well as
possible. He must therefore roll 5+ on 2d6. He succeeds, rolling 8 and,
after three months convalescence, emerges mentally fit and well.

DRUGS


In the absence of residential convalescence, certain drugs are
available that either block or cure Psionic Trauma; these are
described in the Psionic Equipment chapter, beginning on page 83.
Relying on drugs alone usually requires more time to cure Psionic
Trauma and drugs can be combined with psychiatric care to improve
the chances of recovery.

SUBSTANCE ABUSE


Narcotics that dull the senses can suppress the effects of Psionic
Trauma but do not remove it. In the long-term they may increase
the chances of Psionic Trauma returning and, of course, the psion
risks becoming reliant on alcohol or drugs simply to make it through
the day, along with the other unwanted side effects of substance
addiction.

Relying on substance abuse works in one of three ways. Either:

- The substance used negates the DMs to using talents and
    increases the Psionic Strength point costs.
- The Mental Instability check period is extended – but the target
    number is reduced.
- A combination of the two.

The Referee should decide in which of the ways a substance will
work. Some guidance is given Drug Effects table.

The table does not take into account levels of addiction and side
effects of abuse and addiction. Referees must handle these
additional conditions according to their own judgement and
campaign requirements.

Continued substance abuse may also become ineffective after time,
as the body and mind becomes inured to the palliative effects of
the substance. Again, Referees should decide, at what point, Psionic
Trauma can no longer be controlled through self-medication.

Mental Instability
Mental Instability results from Psionic Trauma but runs parallel
to it and must be treated separately. A character can have Psionic
Trauma cured but Mental Instability may still remain (or both might
be treated together – it depends on the care).

A Mental Instability is accrued when the Mental Instability target
number, resulting from Psionic Trauma, is equalled or exceeded on
2d6. There are several instabilities and the one the character suffers
may be chosen by the Referee or rolled for randomly. These are
quantified in the Behavioural Effects table.
BEHAVIOURAL EFFECTS


2d6 Instability Behavioural Effects Game Effects
2 Phobia (roll on or
consult, Phobia
table at the end
of the chapter to
determine the
nature of the
phobia)

The character becomes irrationally
afraid of certain situations,
activities, things or people. The
main symptom of this disorder is
the excessive, unreasonable desire
to avoid the feared subject.

Assign the phobia an intensity of between 2 and 12 (or roll 2d6). When
the character encounters the source of the phobia he must roll over the
target number, with DMs for Int + Life Sciences (Psychology) or Survival
to react calmly and rationally around it. If he fails, the character will go
out of his way to avoid the subject, with the Effect determining the degree
of reaction (hysterics, tears, panic attacks and so forth) and the DM that
must be applied to any skills the character wishes to use whilst in the
presence of the phobia's source.
3 Compulsion/
Obsession

The character becomes fixated with
a certain person, place, situation,
routine and so on. The compulsion
drives behaviour to the exclusion
of all else and, if particularly acute,
dominates the character's life.

Assign the condition an intensity of between 2 and 12 (or roll 2d6). The
character must roll this number or higher, with a DM for Endurance or
be forced to engage in obsessive/compulsive behaviour whenever in
the presence of a trigger or in a particular situation. The Effect of the
failed roll is the DM applied to all skills that may need to be used whilst
the condition is prevalent. Once the obsession or compulsion has been
satisfied, then the character may behave normally.

PPSIONICSIONIC T TRAUMARAUMA PSIONIC TRAUMA



4 Paranoia Paranoia typically includes
persecutory beliefs concerning
perceived threats, conspiracy
theories and an underlying belief
that others, seen or unseen, intend
harm in some way.

Assign the condition an intensity of between 2 and 12 (or roll 2d6). The
character must roll this number or higher, with a DM for Int + Psi, to
avoid paranoid feelings overcoming him whenever he is in the presence of
something that might trigger a paranoia attack or a stressful situation. The
Effect of the failed roll is the DM applied to all skills that may need to be
used whilst the paranoia is prevalent. Once it or the character, is removed,
then the paranoia subsides. The Effect also indicates the level of behaviour
the character exhibits when faced with a potential source of paranoia (mistrust, anger, panic attacks, flight response and so forth).
5 Bipolar Disorder Extreme mood swings, veering
between high elation, 'normal'
behaviour and deep depression. A
mood swing can occur at any time
but typically in response to events
that cause either excitement,
disappointment or anxiety.

The Referee should decide when a trigger event may result in a bipolar
swing. The character then needs to roll End + Int 8+ to control the swing
to either elation or depression. Elation results in the character becoming
hyperactive and histrionic, prone to wild bursts of enthusiasm. Depression
results in feelings of dejection and social withdrawal which may verge on
the suicidal. The Effect of the roll will determine the degree of severity of
either swing.
6 Schizophrenia Schizophrenia is a combination
of delusions, hallucinations and,
sometimes, imaginary voices.
The sufferer usually has trouble
in communicating ideas clearly
and feels uncomfortable in social
situations. Schizophrenia is in
constant operation and has no
particular trigger. Sufferers can
control the symptoms when
they are calm and not placed
in stressful situations. Equally,
they may simply lapse into a
schizophrenic state with no
apparent trigger.

Assign the condition an intensity of between 2 and 12 (or roll 2d6). The
character must roll this number or higher, with a DM for End + Psi, to
avoid suffering a schizophrenic episode when placed in any kind of stress.
The Effect of the failed roll determines what the character experiences,
ranging from panic attacks, through hallucinations and to hearing
imaginary voices or suffering from dangerous delusions about their own
abilities.

7 Delusions Delusional characters believe that
their capabilities are far higher
and greater than they are and
generally far greater and higher
than anyone else's. Delusions of
power, attractiveness or prowess
in a particular skill and so on,
lead them to make wild boasts,
outlandish claims and rash,
dangerous decisions that may
threaten themselves and others.
Delusion sufferers who attain
positions of power generally abuse
it, to the detriment of others.

There are no specific game effects for Delusions. The Referee and player
should discuss the type of delusional behaviour to be exhibited and may,
if they wish, agree an Intensity, that indicates the lengths to which they
will go in pursuing their delusions and the extremes of behaviour that
accompany them.

PSIONIC TRAUMA PPSIONICSIONIC T TRAUMARAUMA



8 Hallucinations The character experiences audio
and visual hallucinations, usually
during times of stress or tiredness.
The hallucinations may be acute
and terrifying or fleeting and
insubstantial. However they are
usually distracting and may trigger
compulsive/obsessive episodes.

Assign the condition an intensity of between 2 and 12 (or roll 2d6). The
character must roll this number or higher, with a DM for End + Psi, to
avoid suffering a hallucinatory episode during a stressful or emotional
time. The Effect of the failed roll indicates the strength of the hallucination
and the way the character responds to it. The Effect also imposes a
negative DM on cognitive skills.

9 Thought Disorder Thought Disorders disturb
the ability to communicate
verbally and in writing; sufferers
stumble over words, cannot get
words out or may be rendered
mute for a time. Similarly they
struggle to read and write, often
writing gibberish or perceiving
the written word as gibberish.
The sufferer may make socially
inappropriate or embarrassing
remarks without realising it or
overly rely on expletives and crude
innuendo, believing it to be entirely
acceptable.

Assign the condition an intensity of between 1 and 6. This is the DM
applied to all verbal and written communication skills, including such
skills as Broker and Diplomat. The condition may be variable – in which
case the DM is rolled on 1d6 from one communication instance to
another.

10 Delirium Delirium is an acute decline in the
ability to focus attention, exercise
clear perception, understand
and follow commands and
general problems with cognition.
Sufferers may lose the ability
to communicate, understand
communication, conduct
straightforward tasks of reasoning
or even complete simple tasks
such as counting or dressing.

Assign the condition an intensity of between 1 and 6. This is the DM
applied to all skills possessed by a character and applied to untrained skill
attempts (creating a DM of between –4 and –9). If delirium is of intensity
6, then the character simply cannot communicate at all and may be fixed
in a semi-comatose daze.

11 Combine two
results, ignoring
Psychosis
12 Psychosis Psychosis is the acute
disconnection from reality.
Sufferers experiencing psychotic
episodes may experience
hallucinations or delusional beliefs (see those entries in this table)
and may exhibit complete changes
in personality. This may be
accompanied by unusual or bizarre
behaviour, as well as difficulty with
social interaction and impairment
in carrying out the activities of
daily living.

Psychotics take the game effects for Delusion. In addition, roll 1d6 for what
additional effects they suffer:

1-2 – No additional effect
3 – Hallucinations
4 – Delirium
5 – Thought Disorder
6 – Schizophrenia

TREATING MENTAL INSTABILITY


Mental instability typically requires long-term treatment,
convalescence and drugs. Many sufferers go through life without
requiring treatment, depending on the condition's intensity but
those who struggle to control the condition require detailed care.

Where a condition has been assigned an intensity, it takes a number
of months equal to twice the intensity to treat the condition effectively.
If the condition is of intensity 4 or below, then hospitalization is not
required and the sufferer can be treated as an outpatient. Intensities
5-7 require equal parts of hospitalization and remote care and
intensity 8+ always requires hospitalization.

No rolls are required to remove the condition but expertise in Medic
and Life Sciences (Psychology) reduce the number of months required
for treatment by their skill levels. Treatment must be undergone for
the full term; if it is broken, then the sufferer is not cured and suffers
a relapse to the condition's previous intensity. At the end of the term,
the character must roll Int + End 9+. If successful, then condition
has been successfully cured. If unsuccessful, then the character is
cured but requires drugs to keep the condition fully at bay. If drugs
are not taken, there is an End 9+ chance that the condition will
return with a new intensity (but reduced by the character's End +
Int DMs).

Insanity
Insanity is a mental instability so deep-rooted that the character is
completely unable to function in society and poses a _constant_ danger
to himself and others.

Any character that has a mental instability condition that goes
untreated sees that condition increase in intensity by 1 for every
1d3 years it is left untreated. Once the intensity reaches 12 or
higher, the character is clinically insane. He loses all ability to
control his condition and he effectively withdraws from society

- and may become suicidal or homicidal. The only safe way to
treat an insane person is to confine them and subject them to
intensive, long-term treatment. The treatment period is half the
intensity level of the condition, +2d6, in years. Some insane
characters may never be cured.

Player Characters in a truly insane condition may be retired from
play at the Referee's discretion – although insane characters do
provide some interesting opportunities for roleplaying (and insane
Non-Player Characters always do).

PSIONIC TRAUMA



Any society that gains an understanding of psionics will, inevitably,
find ways of producing equipment that either utilizes psionic energy,
manipulates it or enhances it.

Any piece of equipment that uses psionic energy in some way must
be psi-calibrated; that is, circuited to receive, adapt and manipulate
psi energy as the psion's mind produces it. Note that this is not the
same as using the Machine Symbiosis talent; psionically-calibrated
equipment is designed to work with any psion, regardless of talents
trained; the important component is psionic energy and the ability
to harness it.

Any psionic device has a specific function or set of functions. This
might be to enhance a particular talent or power or to replicate one.
Every device requires Psionic Strength points to power it and achieve
its effects; this cost is stipulated in the item's description.

Not all of the devices listed here will be suitable for every campaign.
Referees need to decide what types of devices are available, both at
varying Tech Levels and by campaign type.

including the one just taken). If the check is failed the character
falls ill with a serious fever, suffering 3d6 damage and permanently
reducing his Psionic Strength by one.

Inhibitor Drug
Psionic inhibitors dampen the brain's ability to generate psychic
effects. A character who takes (or, more often, is forcibly injected
with) an inhibitor drug suffers a –4 DM to all Psionic Strength
checks and cannot regain Psionic Strength points. Each hour the
character may make an Endurance check to throw off the effects
of the drug with a +1 DM for every previous check. Inhibitor drugs
have no effect on non-psionic individuals.

Inhibitor Drug Cost: Cr. 5,000 per dose

Trauma Suppressant
These drugs are designed to suppress Psionic Trauma. The drugs
come in six strengths, corresponding to the levels of Psionic
Trauma. One level of strength suppresses one level of trauma; thus,
to suppress two levels of Psionic Trauma, a Level 2 Suppressant
needs to be taken.

The drug does not cure Psionic Trauma; it merely controls its effects
allowing a psion to live a normal, everyday life. However, the body
and mind can become inured to the drug's effects; for every month,
roll End + Psi 9+. If the roll succeeds then the body begins to resist
the drug's effects and it will require a strength of suppressant one
level higher than actually needed or desired to suppress trauma.

Trauma Suppressants have some physical side effects. These start

NEW SKILL SPECIALITY – ENGINEER (PSI EQUIPMENT)
A specialization of the Engineer skill is Psi Equipment. This skill
covers the manufacture, repair, maintenance and calibration
of psi-enabled devices. It is applied in the same way as any
other version of Engineer but applies specifically to psi device
functions.

DRUGS


Psi-Drugs
These drugs restore Psionic Strength if taken when the character
has already spent Psionic Strength points or temporarily increase
the character's Psionic Strength if taken when he is at full Psionic
Strength.

ENHANCERS


Enhancers are technical devices, psionically calibrated, to enhance either
the overall performance of a psion's capabilities or a specific talent.

Psi Enhancer
Available either as a skull implant (in which the enhancer circuits are
etched directly into the skull) or as an external, battery-powered headset-like array, the Psi Enhancer improves the Psionic Strength DM – but
not the Psi Points – by +1 for every level of complexity. Psi Enhancers
are necessarily expensive; especially for the implant option.

An implanted enhancer requires a surgical procedure as the circuitry
needs to be physically wired to the brain. Psions undergoing the
operation must throw Endurance 8+ (with DMs for the levels of
medical expertise performing the operation) to avoid complications.
If the roll is failed, check the effect on the table below to determine
the nature of the complications:

Effect Complication
4 Brain Damage: lose 1d6+1 Int. If Int is reduced to 0,
patient is left in a persistent vegetative state.
3 Brain Damage: lose 1d3 Int
2 2 Levels of Psionic Trauma
1 1 Level of Psionic Trauma

External Psi Enhancer Cost: Cr. 50,000 per level.
Implanted Psi Enhancer Cost: Cr. 80,000 per level, plus hospital
and surgery costs.

Talent Chip
A specific psionic talent is encoded onto a data wafer that is accessed via
either a Psi Enhancer or a standard neural interface. Note that a talent
chip will not confer a psionic talent on someone who is none psionic.

The chip gives the psion the talent at level 0. The cost is based on
how many powers are included as part of the chip's data array.

Talent Chip Cost: Basic Talent, Cr. 20,000 + Cr. 2,000 per power;
Advanced Talent, Cr. 50,000 + Cr. 3,000 per power.

Personal Psi Battery (PPB)
A Personal Psi Battery stores Psionic Strength points for later use.
A battery can hold up to 10 Psi Points and is charged by the psion
during rest periods. Psi Points channelled into the battery, rather
than into the psion's own mind, will therefore increase the length
of any rest period if the psion wants to regain his full Psi points
compliment.

A psion can draw on up to 3 points from the battery at a time. If
not used, stored Psi points degrade and are lost. Degradation
begins after 3 days with 1 point being lost per day until the battery
is empty.

PPB Cost: Cr. 30,000.

NEUTRALISERS


Neutralisers work to defend and protect against psionic interference
and can be used by non-psions.

Psionic Shield
Available at TL 12+. Any armor incorporating a helmet or hood can be
outfitted with a psionic shield to block Telepathy. Unlike the Telepathy
power shield, a technological shield is invulnerable to assault and
blocks send thoughts. It cannot be lowered without removing the
helmet or hood containing the shield. Buildings and vehicles can also
be psionically shielded but this increases the cost by 10%.

Psionic Shield Cost: Cr. 40,000.

Anti-Psi Spray
Available at TL 12+. An aerosol neutraliser, the Ant-Psi Spray projects a cloud
of nano-particles, 1 meter in diameter, into the air. The nano particles are
molecularly calibrated to absorb psionic energy and dissipate it harmlessly.
Every blast of the spray neutralises 3+1d6 Psionic Strength points placed
into an active power that must be directed through the cloud's area of
effect. The cloud itself dissipates after 1d6 Combat Rounds.

A standard canister of spray provides 5 bursts.

Anti-Psi Spray Cost: Cr. 5,000 per canister.

Disruption Unit
Available at TL 12+. This small unit emits a constant electro-psionic
field that disrupts psionics within its sphere of influence. The unit
carries a 100 point charge, with its operation drawing on this charge
at the rate of 1 point per minute. The maximum setting is variable
between 1 and 6 points, with each point applying a negative DM
to all psionic use equal to the points setting. The disruption unit
affects an area of a 3 meter radius. The unit can be recharged from a
standard power source, taking 1 minute per point to recharge.

Disruption Unit Cost: Cr. 20,000.

WEAPONS


Psionic Energy Sword
Available at TL 14+ and a favored weapon of some mystical orders.
The haft of this weapon is a tube of about 30cm in length and
equipped with either heat sinks or heat dispersing fins at the base
of the haft. It is psionically calibrated to psionic users and, when
activated, generates an energy blade of about a meter in length.
The psion unconsciously limits the blade length, preventing it from
operating as a conventional, ranged, energy weapon: its costs the
psion 1 Psi point per hour to maintain the blade's integrity.

The weapon's damage is 4d6, plus the Effect of a successful Psionic Strength
8+ roll. The haft contains a battery that provides up to 4 hours of continuous
operation. The skill required to use the weapon is Melee (blade).

Psionic Energy Sword Cost: Cr. 100,000 (limited availability).

PSIONIC EQUIPMENT PSIONIC EQUIPMENT



Psi Gun
Available at TL 14+. This weapon resembles a somewhat bulbous
pistol that connects to an implanted data jack on either the arm or
temple. Quite simply, the gun translates Psionic Strength into an
invisible-light energy beam. It does not require a psionic talent to
use but does require the Gun (energy pistol) skill.

The user calibrates the gun to the number of Psi points it will draw
with each shot. Every Psi point produces 1d6+2 damage. It obviously
requires no ammunition but is equipped with a standard power cell
that allows for 50 hours of continuous operation.

Psi Gun Cost: Cr. 200,000 (power cell 1,500 each).

Psi Rifle
Available at TL 14+. This weapon is the larger sister to the Psi Gun.
Each Psi point converts to 2d6+3 damage and its power cell allows
for 70 hours of continuous operation.

Psi Rifle Cost: Cr. 400,000 (power cell 2,000 each).

Mind Bomb
A mind bomb is a grenade-sized device that can be charged with
Psi points which are stored in an internal storage sliver. The device
can be set to activate on a timer (up to 2 minutes) and either set in
place or hurled.

When the bomb goes off, it unleashes the stored psionic energy
in an instantaneous wave that affects a radius of 3+1d6 meters.
Everything caught in that radius experiences a negative DM to skills
equal to the bomb's stored Psi points for 1d6 rounds.

Mind Bomb Cost: Cr. 1,000.

Trauma Grenade
A specifically anti-psion device, this psychoactive grenade, when it
explodes, induces Psionic Trauma in any psions caught in its blast
radius of 3+1d6 meters. Psions must throw End + Psionic Strength
10+ to withstand the unleashing of the trauma-inducing energy or
suffer 1+1d3 levels of Psionic Trauma.

Trauma Grenade Cost: Cr. 3,000.

VEHICLES


Any vehicle can be equipped with a Psi interface to enhance its
capabilities – and starships receive their own chapter in this book.
The vehicles here are those that fall outside of the conventional,
although time machines and dimensional travel machines are
covered in the Mind Ships chapter, beginning on page 89.

Levitation Throne
Available at TL 11+. A levitation throne is specifically designed to
enhance the Fly power of the Telekinesis talent. The throne can have
many configurations; from an ornate chair, through to an enclosed
bubble but is usually a personal transportation device. Psionically
calibrated sensors built into the throne amplify Psionic Strength,
allowing the user to fly at 6 meters per round for a number of hours (rather than rounds) per Psi point drawn from the user. The psion
needs to be trained in Telekinesis but does not need to make a
Telekinesis roll to activate and use the throne; all that is necessary
is a constant flow of 1 Psi point per hour.

If the levitation throne user wants to carry others or equipment,
then he must expend an additional 2 Psi for every 100kg carried. The
throne must also be modified to carry either cargo or passengers,
otherwise the psion must rely on other telekinetic powers to do the
job.

Levitation Throne Cost: Cr. 250,000 (plus Cr. 1,000 per 100kg of
modification for either cargo or passengers).

Teleportation System
Available at TL 14+. Teleportation systems disassemble matter,
transmit it and reassemble it elsewhere. A teleportation system
works best when transmitting to another system, greatly lessening
the chance of a fault in re-assembly, which invariably results in
trauma and possibly death.

To work correctly, a roll of 8+ must be made for the teleportation
attempt. DMs are applicable for Computers or Engineer skills. If
the roll is successful, then the teleported subject arrives unscathed,

transferred almost instantaneously. If the roll is unsuccessful, then
the subject takes 1d6 damage to each physical characteristic for
every point of failed Effect.

If the teleportation system is transmitting to another receiving
system, then the operation roll is considered Routine (+2).

A teleportation system has a maximum range of Planetary and
cannot operate at distances above 50,000 km. If Referees wish it, a
further –1DM can be applied to the operation roll for every 10,000
km of distance that the system operates over.

Teleportation systems can be rigged into complex networks
providing instantaneous global travel. System to system transfers
incur no disadvantages for altitude and energy conservation, being
ready programmed to insulate and compensate for, these hazards.

The same system that made the transfer can also affect a return
transfer, using sensors to lock onto the subjects when an
appropriate signal is given. A Sensors 8+ roll is needed for a safe
lock-on and return. The return transfer attempt works in the same
way as before.

Teleportation systems are available in a variety of sizes, allowing
multiple people and cargo to be teleported simultaneously. A single-system costs MCr. 2 and displaces 1 ton; larger systems displace a
further 0.5 tons for each individual or 100kg to be transported and
cost a further MCr. 1 per 0.5 tons.

Teleportation System Cost: MCr2 (+MCr 1 for each additional 0.5
tons).

Teleportation Tractor Beam
Available TL 14+. A highly sophisticated device intended to divert
a teleporter and transport them to a pre-arranged destination. The
device is a bulky, box-like array combining sensors, field emitters
and other electronics. It weighs 10 kg but is too bulky for a single
person to move it.

PSIONIC EQUIPMENT PPSIONICSIONIC E EQUIPMENTQUIPMENT



The device works by picking-up Psionic Strength used to power
a teleport attempt using a powerful sensor array and psionically
calibrated redirection matrices. To operate the device, a teleportation
attempt must first be successfully detected; this is an automated
system function that successfully locates the psionic power output
on a roll of 8+. Next, the device must successfully redirect the
teleporter, again on a roll of 8+ but reduced by a DM equal to the
psion's Psionic Strength DM, plus a –1 DM for every kilometer of
distance between it and the teleporter. The machine has a maximum
range of 6 kilometers.

If the detection and redirection attempts are successful, the
teleporter arrives in the predetermined destination instead of the
one intended; Psi points are still expended, as though the correct
teleportation had taken place.

To accurately set the destination controls of the tractor beam, the
operator must succeed in a Computers or Navigation 8+ roll, with
the Effect determining the precision of the co-ordinates.

Teleportation Tractor Beam Cost: Cr. 500,000.

Teleportation Suit
Available at TL 12+, this device can be integrated into a suit of armor
or worn as a form-hugging bodysuit. It rapidly cools or warms the

body after a teleport, minimising the damage from sudden energy
gains or losses. The suit allows a character to jump up to 600
meters up or down in a single teleport or up to 10 kilometers in a
single hour when using successive jumps.

Teleportation Suit Cost: Cr. 50,000.

MISCELLANEOUS EQUIPMENT


Psi Detector
For use by non-psionics, the psi detector is a hand-held device that
detects residual or active psi energy within a radius of 500 meters.
Where active psi energy is detected (in other words, psionic powers
under use), the detector can provide an indication of the amount of
psi energy involved; the indication is low, medium and high, relating
to the number of psi points invested in the particular power under
use.

For residual energy, the reading will always be low but retrograde
analysis on rates of decay can offer a general indication of how long
ago a power was used, with an accuracy of up to 3 hours.

Psi Detector Cost: Cr. 12,000.

Image Sliver
Image Slivers are psionically calibrated data wafers that can record
and store psionically obtained data: thoughts, emotions, auras,
memories, nightmares and so forth. The sliver is a blue-black data
wafer 5mm x 5mm in length and width. It can store up to 10 hours
of recorded thoughts, memories or emotions or the aura signatures
of 10 people. Non-psions can access the material recorded on the
sliver by inserting it into a standard neural interface jack if they
are suitably augmented; psions can access the information in a
similar way or, if they have the Telepathy or Clairvoyance talents,
simply by holding the sliver and spending a single Psi point whilst
concentrating on the sliver.

Non-psions who access a sliver find the information strange,
random and often disturbing. The senses are flooded with the
recorded data and the feedback taps into the emotional areas of the
brain to transfer the recording. The imagery found even in the most
placidly recorded thoughts can introduce sensory overload and so
End 9+ rolls are required otherwise the character suffers a –1 DM to
all skills for a period of minutes equal to the length of the recording
as they seek to adjust to the information they have downloaded.
Memories, emotions and other data may also resurface at random
intervals even after the sliver has been removed for 1d6 days after
being accessed, with effects that need to be adjudicated by the
Referee. Psions are attuned to the way mental data is recorded and
do not suffer from these effects.

Image Sliver Cost: Cr. 250.

PPSIONICSIONIC E EQUIPMENTQUIPMENT



Mind Reader
Available at TL 12+. A device for non-psions, a Mind Reader is a
headset device that is worn by the user and linked to electrodes
that are connected to the temples or skull of the subject. The device
provides the user with temporary psionic abilities, allowing him to
read thoughts and emotions as though a psion with a skill level
of 0 in Telepathy. The item grants virtual Psi points equal to the
character's current End score.

Mind Reader Cost: Cr. 50,000.

Psi Scanner
This device scans the brain to determine psionic potential. It is
available at TL8, with higher TL models being smaller, becoming
portable at TL10. The device connects to the skull of the subject via
electrodes or (in higher TL models) sensors (TL 9+) and conducts a
deep, highly intense, highly accurate EEG scan specifically focused
on detecting latent Psionic Strength.

If the subject has untrained psionic capability, the scanner detects
it in a roll of 8+, with DMs for Medic or other, appropriate science
skills.

At TL 9, the scanner also provides an indication of Psionic Strength
but it does not provide a precise figure (within +/– 2 points of actual
Psionic Strength). The device can remote scan up to a range of 10
meters.

At TL10, the scanner provides an accurate Psionic Strength reading
and also indicates which talents the subject has a propensity for

learning (these specifics will need to be adjudicated by the Referee).
The device can remote scan up to a range of 20 meters.

Psi Scanner Cost: TL8 Cr. 10,000; TL 9+ Cr. 8,000.

Aura Array
Available at TL10+. This headset device can be used by non-psions
and replicates the Read Aura power of the Aura Perception talent
at level 0. The user can see and interpret psionic auras but cannot
manipulate, mask or project them. The item grants virtual Psi points
equal to the character's current End score.

Aura Array Cost: Cr. 10,000.

Mind Switch Device
Available at TL 14+. This device exchanges the minds of two
subjects, in the same way as the Tapping talent of Mind Switch.
For the mind switch to be successful, the operator must throw
Electronics or Computers 8+ to operate the device, with the Int
DM of any unwilling participants acting as a negative DM for the
skill roll.

The mind switch has a safe limit of a number of hours equal to the
Effect of the machine operation roll, multiplied by the result of a 2d6
throw. If minds are not swapped back at the end of this time, both
subjects begin to accrue 1 level of Psionic Trauma for each 6 hour
period thereafter.

Mind Switch Device Cost: Cr. 250,000 (limited availability).

PSIONIC EQUIPMENT



Ships powered by the mind figure large in science fiction stories:
Anne McAffrey's Helva ( The Ship Who Sang ) and M John Harrison's
Seria Mau Genlicher ( Light ) being two obvious examples; there
are many others – the Cylon Hybrid from Battlestar Galactica and
the semi-psionic Mass Detectors from Larry Niven's Known Space
series, for instance.

The Psionic Powers chapter includes the psionic rules for mind-powered ships in the form of the Ship Integration talent, whereby one
or more psions can move a ship or augment drives, at both sub and
supra light speeds. This chapter includes the essential information
needed for adapting starships built using the Traveller rules (either
the basic rules or High Guard ) to support psionic integration.

DEGREE OF INTEGRATION


The rules in Traveller: Psions assumes that, at the least, a psionic pilot
will be highly integrated with the ship's architecture and systems.
The reason for this is simple; even in small ships requiring just a
single pilot, flying a starship is a complex business and rarely the
responsibility of one person. Helm positions traditionally include
a pilot and co-pilot, comms officer, sensors officer, astrogator/
navigator and, sometimes, an engineering position. A psion can
assume all these functions, handling them simultaneously, if he is
integrated with the ship's systems. Drives, sensors, avionics, life
support – all these functions can be controlled and monitored by a
single mind, depending on the size and complexity of the ship.

However, in your campaign you may not want to have your psion
umbilically connected with the ship; a simple neural jack may do the
trick or perhaps the psion speaks, mind to mind, with a controlling
AI. If so, then you can readily ignore some of the sections that
follow; integrate psions the way you want to, to reflect the needs of
your campaign.

Whilst a single psion could, feasibly, control a whole ship, from
all the helm positions through to gunnery, it will put an enormous
strain on that psion's capabilities – not least from the amount of Psi
points needed to fuel the powers required. For this reason larger
ships may have multiple psions, integrated to greater or lesser
degrees, to share the workload and allow rest and regeneration.
Integrated psions in particular are at risk of Psionic Trauma through
rapid, continual use of powers and so it makes sense to have a relief
psion and psions perhaps dedicated to a single task, to replace the
additional crew members.

DRIVE AND POWERPLANT



POTENTIAL, FUEL
Using psions to either move or augment ship drives means that the
usual requirements for drive and powerplant size and fuel storage,

can be re-evaluated. Depending on how much the psion will be used
to complement (or even replace) drives will mean that a lower rating
powerplant and reduced fuel tankage is needed, to achieve the same
performance as a ship without a psion complement.

The actual reduction in requirements depends on several factors:

- The Psionic Strength of the psion(s) in control of the ship.
- The performance desired.
- System redundancy: doing away with a Jump drive is all very
    well – but what if the psion is incapacitated or killed? The ship
    might not need as much (or any) fuel but even psions need to
    recharge.
- Net gains in terms of hull capacity if psions are used; reducing
    fuel, powerplant and drive requirements does not negate the fact
    that components such as a PIC (see below) are required. Will
    savings in one area be adequately compensated in another?

Much therefore depends on the ship design and desired performance.
The potential gains in Jump capability and Thrust rating might not be
great enough to offset reliance on conventional systems in terms of
cost. On the other hand, the gains might be just what is required.

MIND SHIP COMPONENTS


The following components are available at TL14 and above. This is
a guideline only; psion-enabled ships may have been developed at
lower tech levels in your campaign. Not all of them are essential and
again, campaign type will dictate what is required.

Psion Integration Chamber
A Psion Integration Chamber is the life support system and interface
for an integrated psion pilot. It can be built directly into a ship's
hull, at a reduced tonnage and cost but removing the integrated
psion from it is a surgical procedure requiring specialist surgical
knowledge and apparatus (Medic 3 or higher); or it can be modular,
allowing the PIC to be moved from one ship to another. A PIC of
one hull tonnage can be fitted to another within 100 tons either
side; a 200 ton-calibrated PIC can fit a 100 ton and 300 ton ship,
for example.

The PIC contains all the essential psionically calibrated instruments,
interfaces and life support systems needed by the occupants. This
includes video/audio feeds to the main bridge and connections to
engineering and weapon systems, if that degree of engineering is
required.

The tonnage of the PIC itself is 1% of the hull displacement, plus 1
ton for every 4 Psi Strength points the psion has. This supports a
single psion occupant; if additional psion crew places are required
in the same PIC, increase the PIC displacement by 0.5 tons, plus 0.5
tons for every 4 Psi Strength points the additional psions have.

### MMINDIND S SHIPSHIPS

MMINDIND S SHIPSHIPS MIND SHIPS



If the PIC is built directly into a starship hull, it is fixed in place. Its
displacement and cost is 25% less than the modular equivalent.

The PIC can be hardened against EMP attacks at an additional 10%
of its base cost and hardened against psionic attacks at an additional
15% of base cost.

If a modular PIC is to be made ejection-capable, its tonnage must
be increased by 10% to include the necessary ejection mechanisms;
and, if the module is to have its own motive power, its tonnage
must be increased to include M and J drives, plus a powerplant and
fuel (although these components may not be essential if the psion
provides all motive power or augments drive performance, thereby
reducing the fuel requirement). Ejection systems add 3% to the cost
and drives/powerplant costs are per the _Traveller Core Rulebook_ and
_High Guard_ rules.

PIC Cost: MCr. 1 per ton.

K interfaces are not costed on hull size because they are localised
to the PIC or wherever the psion is located for his duties. Neither
is a PIC necessary to support a K interface; it can be installed into
a standard bridge array. The interface is hardened against EMP but
cannot be hardened against hostile psionics.

A K interface will serve only one psion. It can be shared but if
multiple psions are to benefit concurrently, then multiple interfaces
are needed.

K Interface Cost: MCr. 0.5 per +1 to psionic talent skill (to a maximum
of +6).

Standard Psion Helm Position
Only an integrated pilot requires a PIC. Psions occupying other helm
or bridge positions need only the requisite, calibrated interfaces for
their function. Each psion-enabled position adds a further 2% to the
Bridge cost but produces no additional displacement.

Standard Psion Helm Position Cost: 2% of Bridge Cost.

K Vault
Available at TL 15+, a K Vault is a psionic battery, storing psionic
strength energy that can be drawn upon by integrated psions to
supplement their own Psionic Strength. A K Vault can only be used
where a K interface has been installed and to be able to handle
the energy draw, the psion using the battery must have Psi and
Endurance totalling 16 or more. If the Psi + End is less than 16, then
using the K Vault results in the psion suffering a level of Psionic
Trauma for every 5 points drawn, if he cannot succeed in a Psi +
End roll of 10+.

The K Vault discharges psionic energy in 'blocks' of 1, 3 or 5 Psi
Points, the psion controlling how much is drawn and when, though
they can never draw more than their maximum Psi points at any one
time. It is common for most psions to rely on their own Psi reserves
before drawing on the vault's but this is not a requisite for use.

K Vaults come in capacities of 10, 20, 50, 80 and 100 points at a cost
of 1 MCr. per 10 points of storage. The Vault displaces a number of
tons equal to 10% of its capacity.

The Psi points stored in the battery are generated by psions
themselves during resting periods. When not actively using
psionics, the psion can direct Psi points into the battery as they are
regenerated at whatever rate he chooses.

K Vault Cost: MCr. 1 per 10 points of storage.

K Defence Grid
A defensive array, the K Defence Grid projects Psionic Strength
points to form an energy shield that defends one particular facing or
set of ship hit locations, from incoming energy and ballistic attacks.

Advanced K Interface
A PIC comes equipped with the standard psionic interface points
required to integrate psion and ship. An optional extra is to invest
in high-end, military-grade interfaces and circuits, known as K
interfaces. K interfaces boost psionic talent performance, adding
a DM to all psionic talents used directly through the ship (Ship
Integration is the obvious talent but others can also benefit).

MIND SHIPS MMINDIND S SHIPSHIPS



The psion needs to use the Gunnery power of the Ship Integration
talent and can power the Defence Grid with as many or as few Psi
points as needed. Every 2 Psi points used in the grid offers 1 point of
ship armor and it costs 1 Psi point to cover up to 3 Hit Locations.
Therefore, to field 4 points of armor to cover 3 locations would cost
9 Psi points. For this reason, K Defence Grids are generally used
when a K Vault is present.

The projector is a large, psionically calibrated device located in a
well-shielded part of the hull. It displaces 5 tons and costs MCr. 10.

K Defence Grid Cost: MCr. 10.

Psion Stateroom
Kitted and equipped to promote rest, peace and silence – everything
a weary psion needs to regenerate his energies, the psion stateroom
is similar in size to a standard stateroom, with the same hull
displacement. The room is fitted with psionically calibrated, mood-calming environment sensors, that promote the regeneration
of Psionic Strength points. A psion using a psion stateroom
commences Psi regeneration 1 hour after using a psionic talent and
at the rate of 1.5 points per hour.

Psion Stateroom Cost: MCr. 1.

Ship K-Web
A K-Web uses the hull of the ship as a psionic interface, allowing the
integrated psion(s) to draw on the power of everyone else within the
ship, even if they are not psionic. Every individual has some latent
psionic ability, producing minute amounts of Psionic Strength; in
non-psions the energy is too low to be of any value but en-masse an
integrated psion can gain benefit from it.

The K-Web is built into the fabric of the hull, with discreet sensors
located in strategic points to detect, capture and channel Psionic
Strength to the psion. The K-Web requires both a Psion Integration
Chamber and K Interface to work correctly. Its machinery displaces
0.25 tons per 100 tons of hull.

The K-Web generates and channels, 1 Psi point for every 20 (non-psion) people aboard the ship. This is not a continuous activity
as the process drains Psionic Strength from the crew and it takes
the same length of time to regenerate the latent Psi points as
for a psion. Psions can, if they wish, resist the K-Web's draw by
rolling Psionic Strength + End 8+; alternatively, they can regulate
how much Psionic Strength they donate – either be volunteering a
certain number of points or agreeing an amount with the integrated
psion who will benefit; the integrated psion then only draws the
permitted amount.

Psionic Strength generated through a K-Web cannot be battery
stored; it must be used immediately by the integrated psions. Any
unused energy naturally dissipates.

Ordinarily, all non-psions are subject to the K-Web's draw but
insulators, in the form of bracelets or headbands, can be made

available which prevent latent Psionic Strength from being taken (for religious or ethical reasons, for instance). These insulators also
protect psions.

K-Web Cost: MCr. 1 per 0.25 tons.

TIME & DIMENSIONAL MACHINES
Whilst not, strictly speaking, psionic devices, machines that move
through time or between dimensions have a place in this chapter
owing to the time and dimensional manipulation talents described
in the Psionic Powers chapter.

Time and dimensional travel-capable devices can either be
standalone, dedicated vehicles, designed to perform only the one
function or can be augmentations to an existing starship. It is up
to the Referee to decide if any of these devices require a psion pilot
with the appropriate talents to make full use of them.

Time Drive
A Time Drive is a specific drive designed to enable time travel for an
existing vehicle, typically a starship. Like any other kind of drive it
uses the existing powerplant for its function and displaces a certain
amount of hull tonnage.

Instead of moving a vessel through space, the T drive moves
it forwards or backwards through time. Its maximum period of
movement (hours, days, months, years and so forth) depends on
the drive code and the Hull Volume.

The T Drive Potential table indicates the maximum number of time
increments the ship can achieve in a single time jump:

Increment Range Increment
1 Rounds
2 Minutes
3 Hours
4 Days
5 Weeks
6 Months
7 Years
8 Decades
9 Centuries
10 Millennia

Thus, a 300 ton ship with a TF Time Drive could achieve up to
increment 4 – days – backwards or forwards in time; with a TM drive,
it could travel across all 10 increments; from Rounds up to Millenia.

The Fuel requirement for the drive is based on the size of the ship
and the increment it wants to travel and is calculated as 0.05 x half

tonnage x increment number. Thus, a 300 ton ship wanting to move
days through time, would require 0.05 x 150 x 4 = 30 tons.

Dedicated fuel tonnage for a time machine must be factored into the
total hull displacement tonnage and can be added to fuel allocated
for J and M drives and the P plant. Note that the P Plant must have
an equivalent or higher rating, to the T drive.

There is no limit on how far a time ship can move through time, as
long as its movement does not exceed its incremental band.

Thus, a 300 ton, TF-equipped ship, can move up to:

1-10 Rounds
1-60 minutes
1-24 hours
1-7 days

It cannot move above 7days (even by a few seconds) as it has
reached the limitations of its drive capability.

PILOTING TIME MACHINES


If the pilot of a time ship is a psion, then the Temporal Manipulation talent is the obvious candidate for the governing skill roll. If the
character has both Pilot and Temporal Manipulation, the character can be assigned a rating of Pilot (Time Machine/Ship) 0.

Alternatively, non-psion characters can take Pilot (Time Machine/Ship) as a Pilot speciality when they gain the Pilot skill as part of
their career progression.

The Effect of any Pilot (Time Machine/Ship) roll determines the accuracy of arriving at the destination time. An Effect of 4+ indicates
that the ship arrives at precisely the time desired, whilst lower Effects indicate a margin of error either side of the desired time.

ADDING A TIME DRIVE TO SMALLER VESSELS


As long as the hull of the vessel has the capacity to accommodate
both the T drive and fuel, there is no reason why a Time Drive cannot
be fitted to hulls of less than 100 tons.

TIME MACHINE OPTIONS


Ambient Environment Cloak: This unit, available at TL14+, projects
a holographic image around the time machine or time ship so that
it better blends with its environment. The sensors in the cloaking
device sample the local environment, including buildings, small
structures, foliage/undergrowth and so on and provide the controller
with a selection of images to project that will make the vessel less
obtrusive.

The cloak displaces 10% of the hull tonnage and works from the
installed power plant. The accuracy of the projected image is
determined on an 8+ roll. The higher the Effect, the less attention
will be attracted due to the vessel appearing to be incongruous.
Note, though, that the cloak does not render the vessel invisible,
nor can it optically reduce size. A 100 ton, cloaked time machine will
still resemble a reasonable sized building, for instance; and a 2,000
ton hull will most likely always appear incongruous unless there are
similar sized structures surrounding it.

Ambient Environment Cloak Costs: Cr. 250,000 per ton.

Time Cannon: The Time Cannon channels the time travel properties
of a ship's T drive and directs them at an external target: in other
words, an external target can be moved through time instead of the
time ship.

The maximum increment is equal to the vessel's own time travel
capability and the fuel used is the same as if the ship itself had
completed the time jump. The time cannon can also not influence a
ship of a greater hull tonnage than that of its own vessel – so a 200
ton time ship could not transport a 300 ton ship several hours back
in time to avoid a conflict, for example.

A time cannon displaces 10% of the T drive's tonnage. It operates
only at Short ship combat range.

Time Cannon Cost: MCr. 1 per ton.

Universal Apparel Fabricator: Available at TL 13+. This remarkable
device manufactures clothing that forms an approximate match
with that being worn by the indigenous peoples of the time period.
The clothing synthesiser uses nano fabrics to create the apparel in
designs and textures that pass for the real thing. It cannot fabricate
armor or apparel that requires a technology component (such as a
vacc suit) but everyday garb is well within its capabilities.

The fabricator hooks to the ship's visual sensors and requires a
representative sample of current fashions to be able to extrapolate
what will be appropriate. It also hooks into the ship's Library program
and analyses historical databases to refine designs and styles. A
catalogue of clothing is then presented on a holographic screen so
that the wearer can choose his or her preferred style. Manufacture
of the item takes between 10 and 60 minutes.

A standard fabricator can render a single set of clothes for up to four
people (or four sets of clothes for one person) before its nano fabric
cartridge needs to be replenished.

Universal Apparel Fabricator Cost: Cr. 750,000 (replacement
cartridges Cr. 2,000 each).

Dimensional Vessels
Dimensional vessels are designed to move between parallel
dimensions and, like time ships, the Referee needs to decide if the
pilot needs to be psionically active and trained in the Dimensional
Manipulation talent.

Every vessel needs a D drive and this occupies the same tonnage,
with the same restrictions, as a T drive; so the T drive tables can
be used to calculate the tonnage requirements and capabilities.
However, the number in the T drive potential table indicates the
maximum strength of dimensional barrier that the vessel can
penetrate. Thus, a 300 ton vessel with a DF drive could pass through
a barrier with a strength of 4 but not one with a strength of 5. See
page 60 for strengths of dimensional barriers.

MIND SHIPS



T and D drives can be fitted into the same hull, space permitting,
although fuel requirements must be calculated and accommodated
separately. Note that the P Plant must have an equivalent or higher
rating, to the D drive (and any other drives, if present).

DIMENSION SHIP OPTIONS


Barrier Locator: This device locates potential rifts between dimensions
and assess the strength of the barrier. Rifts are successfully located
on a roll of 8+, with a +1 DM for each level above TL12 of the installed
locator. The locator is a sensor array displacing 0.1 tons and is often
installed as part of a standard sensor array.

Barrier Locator Costs: Cr. 750,000.

Internal Relative Dimensional Adjustor: By harnessing the malleable
nature of dimensional physics, this device allows the internal
capacity of a vessel to vastly exceed its external capacity. The
maximum increase in capacity is 50%, so a 300 ton external hull
could have an internal capacity of 450 tons.

The IRDA displaces 2% of the original hull's volume and needs to
draw on the power plant for continuous operation. If the P plant
is interrupted, then the dimensional adjustment field collapses –
which may have catastrophic results for the occupants of the ship.

IRDA Cost: MCr. 10 per ton.
