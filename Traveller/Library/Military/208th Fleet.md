In keeping with the general doctrine that 'sector fleets fight wars; subsector fleets keep the peace', most subsector fleets do not have capital ships assigned to them on a permanent basis. Heavy assets are normally concentrated at the sector command level, with subsector fleets assigned battleships only if an urgent need arises. The 208th Fleet, however, has a BatRon (battleship squadron) assigned on a more or less permanent basis. It could, in theory, be recalled to sector command to create a unified fleet in wartime.

The 208th Fleet patrols the subsector and protects Imperial interests there, and for this purpose has a force composed mostly of light vessels. It also conducts missions out into Foreven and the Trojan Reach, and maintains the so-called 'ring of steel' around the interdicted worlds of Andor and Candory. These Droyne worlds are Red Zoned with an unusually heavy naval force to maintain the interdiction. [[Capital]] ships are sometimes deployed as part of these interdiction squadrons; another very unusual move on the part of the Imperial navy.

Both the 208th Fleet and elements of the Spinward Marches Fleet assigned to the region have their headquarters at Iderati naval base. The smaller bases at Raweh, Wonstar, Karin, Mirriam, Jone and Emape support patrol and interdiction assets, as well as blocking the approaches to Andor and Candory with heavy system-defence squadrons.

Sector fleet assets are mainly concerned with flag-showing operations out to spinward and rimward, as well as sweeps into District 268 and Darrian space. The latter missions are normally conducted by escort destroyers and smaller craft, with the three light cruiser task groups taking responsibility for the occasional mission trailing-corewards along the [[Sword Worlds]] border and operations outside Imperial space. Task groups can be encountered quite far out in Foreven from time-to-time, but are generally kept within a few weeks' transit of the border.

The Andor Blockade Squadron is based at Raweh. At any given time most, but not all, of its assets are deployed in Andor; the remainder will be in port conducting training and maintenance.
The system is never left uncovered and either the Interdiction Tender or at least two destroyers will be present. The same deployment exists with the Candory Interdiction Squadron, based at Karin.

Also based at Karin is the Heavy Support Squadron, which can reach Andor or Candory in a single jump. The subsector admiral has a flag squadron, although it is rather light; it is able to move around the subsector dealing with whatever problems arise. A pair of battleships is permanently assigned to the Heavy Support Squadron but the ships themselves are often rotated out and replaced with others. Current practice is to use second-class battleships for this role but upon occasion even brand-new dreadnoughts have been sighted over Andor and Candory.
