##### CORDILLON: BOLD NEW WORLD

```
Terraforming is an ignored science in much of the Imperium. With its
mastery of life support systems and artificial environments on high
Tech Level worlds, the Imperium has essentially obsoleted the notion of
transforming an inhospitable planet into an 'Earth-like' paradise. When
you can hollow out a planetoid, pressurise it, fill it with a breathable
atmosphere and spin it to provide a tolerable gravity (or install grav
plates for that matter), the herculean task of transforming an entire planet
becomes moot.
```

```
Despite all this, terraforming projects are still sometimes undertaken.
Planets designated for terraforming usually have several features that
make the path a little less steep. The presence of a planetary magnetic
field, water, the building blocks of a breathable atmosphere (or at least a
cost-effective way to transport those building blocks to the planet) and a
stable star are all important factors.
```

```
However the key factor when deciding to terraform a planet is not its
physical makeup or chemistry at all. It is embedded in the hopes and
dreams of the sentient species that wants to live there.
```

```
3
```

Humans have terraformed planets in an attempt to recreate Terra, Vland,
Zhdant and other habitable worlds they have come from. The Aslan
terraform (Kusyuform) out of an intense racial desire not to own just any
land but land with lush hunting grounds. The Vargr do it out of a desire to
compete with one another for supremacy. Similar reasons can be found
for other starfaring races.

Making the monumental decision to transform an entire world is too tied
up in culture, politics, history and other circumstances to boil it down to a
few reasons. Suffice to say, sometimes terraforming is deemed the right
thing to do no matter how illogical, expensive or impossible it might seem.

There are many reasons that officials from the high-tech desert world of
Albe (Trojan Reach 2211 A540A98-E) and the Imperium have combined
their efforts and resources to terraform the planet Cordillon (Trojan
Reach 2411 C431210-B).

- Preserve the stability of Albe, a key world on the Imperial fringe beset
    by overpopulation.
- Entice colonists to leave the relative safety of an established (if
    crowded) world with the promise of a much more appealing one.
- Establish another viable link in the region's trade routes.
- Provide work for prospective settlers – there is no infrastructure
    project quite like a terraforming project!

Cordillon was named for its plethora of 'cordillera', an ancient [[Terra|Terran]]
word from the Spanish language for long chains of mountain ranges.
Cordillon's ranges cross, collapse together or combine in semi-parallel
courses all over the surface of the planet. The small world has 31 tectonic
plates; typically a high degree of seismic activity and volcanism would be
expected but Cordillon does not exhibit a high degree of either. Its two
currently active volcanos have such elevated peaks that most of their
ejecta goes straight into the vacuum of space, reclaimed by Cordillon's
gravity over time.

Cordillon has no oceans and only one large sea called the Caratossidis,
thought to be named for an ancient [[Terra|Terran]] explorer whose people
colonized the planet millennia ago but the true origins of the name are
lost in antiquity. In addition, the planet has several lakes and moderately
sized river systems. Geological surveys have discovered that beneath the
rocky Heriotza Plains in the southern hemisphere, there are thousands
of aquifers etched in the planet's crust in highly complex patterns that
make their fluids difficult to extract. The concave topography of the
region coupled with its potential water resources make it a frequent topic
of discussion in terraforming plans with the idea being that a second sea
could be constructed in the basin by somehow 'liberating' the water in
the aquifers.

It is thought that Cordillon once had a thin, or possibly standard,
atmosphere but that a glitch or pause in its magnetic field several hundred

4

```
million years ago allowed charged particles from Bizitza, its orange main
sequence star, to strip away much of the atmosphere. Planetologists
have named this event the Erretzea. Despite this event and the resultant
ecological catastrophe, the planet's remaining atmospheric makeup is
an attractive one, with healthy amounts of nitrogen and oxygen, and
a low amount of carbon dioxide and methane. The problem is not its
composition. It is that there simply is not enough of it.
```

```
Cordillon is 6,949km in diameter and has an axial tilt of 18.9 degrees.
Because of its very thin atmosphere, it has a broad range of temperatures,
averaging 20-25°C in the temperate zones during the summers, dropping
to –40°C in the winter from the poles to the tropics. The planet's day is
65.7 standard hours long. Cordillon orbits Bizitza rapidly, giving it a year
of 61.2 standard days.
```

```
Despite its less than hospitable environment, Cordillon hosts several
native life forms, none of which are intelligent. Its plant life is rather sparse
but the planet does feature more than a dozen hardy grasses, most of
which grow in broad plains next to or near its bodies of water. Somewhat
further removed from water are hardier species including unique red and
orange 'cactuses'. Calling this species a cactus is a misnomer but its
familiar appearance to [[Terra|Terran]] cactuses could not be ignored and the
name stuck. It differs from a cactus in that it contains little water and has
several adaptations to deal with increased exposure to stellar radiation.
```

```
In addition to its grasses, cactuses and other plant life, Cordillon also has
hundreds of molds and microbial species, most of which live in its sea,

lakes and rivers, but others subsist in moist underpinnings of rocks in the
plains and basins. Humans emigrating to Cordillon must be inoculated
before coming to the planet or risk suffering from several fatal pulmonary
diseases brought on by inhaling mold spores or viruses native to the
world.
```

```
Paleontological studies performed by the Scout Service have revealed
that Cordillon once hosted a bountiful biosphere, all of which was
destroyed when the Erretzea struck. The more ambitious among the
terraforming crowd dream of using recovered DNA to reconstitute
that biosphere once the planet has acquired more water and a thicker
atmosphere. With plans to do just that, there is a strict quarantine on
introducing non-native life forms to the planet.
```

```
The terraforming of Cordillon begun decades ago, and its effects have
already been felt, but there are aggressive plans afoot to accelerate
the process with the intention of raising the hydrosphere to 20% and
the atmosphere from 'very thin' to 'thin' over the course of the next
25-30 years.
```

```
A 'conveyor belt' of robotic spacecraft is being assembled to tow icy
rock balls from the system's two planetoid belts to drop into Cordillon's
basins. Not only will these asteroid 'bombs' bring more water to the
planet but the explosions from dropping them will break up chemical
compounds in the rocky surface and thicken the atmosphere over time.
Extensive atmospheric factories are being built that will process imported
nitrogen and oxygen, and disseminate them through massive vent
systems. A great deal of land has been reserved or declared temporarily
uninhabitable due to the dangers these projects pose. Many prospective
colonists are suspicious of them, some claiming that they are merely a
front to enable the Imperium to keep all the choice land for themselves.
Dozens of unsanctioned settlements have been built on the periphery of
these danger zones by intransigent colonists who refuse to be told where
they can and cannot live.
```

```
Hundreds of companies and megacorporations have signed contracts
with Albe and the Imperium to provide all manner of services and
products to the colonists and their fledgling civilization. The Albian and
Imperial governments claim that the only way the Cordillonian Dream
can happen in short order is by using established corporations. Waiting
for local industry to germinate will take decades, if not a century. Would-be colonial entrepreneurs have cried foul, complaining they are being
deliberately shut out of the planet's future, some going so far to say
that colonists are being set-up to be the designated slave labour force
of Cordillon. Despite their complaints, companies like GeDeCo seem
to plant another flag on the planet each day, claiming one industrial
endeavor after another.
```

```
GeDeCo's primary contract is to build a Class B orbital starport, a
project expected to take most of a decade to become operational. In a
```

```
7
```

conciliatory gesture, three quarters of the construction and development
jobs have been given to colonists.

The Cordillon system is home to seven additional terrestrial planets (all
airless rock balls), two planetoid belts and two gas giants, each of which
has several moons. Sitting on the periphery of the Imperium, Cordillon
has only been subjected to a Level-II Scout Service survey. The scouts
recorded the basics of each planetary body in the system but for the
most part no one knows what kind of resources are present on its many
worlds.

Hoard, the system's large gas giant, is a super jovian with roughly four
times the mass of Terra's Jupiter. Its immense gravitational pull and
magnetic field make it dangerous for wilderness refuelling of all but the
stoutest of starships.

The system's two planetoid belts are currently being dredged for iceballs
to drop on Cordillon but increased traffic in these zones has attracted a
fledgling belter community, eager to strike gold, platinum and lanthanum
in the vacuum of the belts. The community park their seeker starships
on one of the larger planetoids and a nascent city has sprung up in the
silicate ball's interior.

##### JUMP DRIVE OPERATIONS

The jump drive is the only known means of faster-than-light (FTL) travel
in the Third Imperium universe. It is not well understood by most of its
users, however, and jump drive operations are not wholly predictable.
It is widely theorized that the Ancients and possibly other species
mastered jump technology or at least reached a level of expertise
whereby they could transcend the limitations encountered by all major
races of Charted Space.

For all the races of Charted Space, there are certain limitations on the
use of jump drive, which seem difficult, or perhaps even impossible, to
bypass. A jump takes roughly one week and enables a ship to transit
from one point to another located one to six parsecs away depending
on the jump drive used. This 'jump-six barrier' is the subject of a great
deal of risky experimentation in some cultures; others have accepted
it as immutable.

It may be that everything known about jump travel is wrong; it is certain
that not everything is known. However, jump technology is sufficiently
mature as to allow mostly-reliable travel between star systems. In short,
the races of Charted Space know how to build a jump drive and how to
use it to reach another star system. Many details of exactly how it works
are vague and sometimes the drive will produce unusual results.

This indicates how little is really understood about the jump drive. If
an experiment is performed the same way under the same conditions,
the outcome should be the same each time – within the bounds of
experimental error of course. When the same actions sometimes
produce different results, even though there is no indication that
anything has changed, it is clear that there are additional parameters
not being considered.

MAKING A JUMP



The first requirement – other than having a working jump drive – to
make a jump is what is often known as a 'jump plot'. This is a highly
complex set of dynamic equations taking into account the vessel's size
and mass, local gravity conditions and the relative positions of the start
and end points of the jump, both at time of entry and expected time
of arrival. Once the plot is ready it is fed into the jump drive, which is
brought up to full power and engaged. The drive is needed to enter
jump space, to create the field that protects the ship there and finally
to control the collapse of the jump field in a manner that allows safe re-entry to normal-space.

10

```
THE JUMP PLOT


Plots can be created well ahead of time but degrade for reasons that
are only partially understood. It is generally accepted that the relative
movement of objects in the universe – planets in their orbits and
asteroidal debris in the target or departure system – will render a plot
less accurate over time. What continues to puzzle scientists is that even
building in a predicitive model for these variables does not prevent a plot
from degrading over time. It may be that this is simply because no model
can possibly include every rock or dust cloud across a couple of parsecs
but there are those who claim other factors are at work.
```

```
For this reason, pre-prepared jump plots – called 'course tapes' for
reasons now lost in antiquity – are much less accurate than a plot created
by a ship's astrogator just before jump entry, although it is possible to
prepare a 'plot estimate' and add the last variables just before jumping.
This practice is common aboard ships that expect to make a particular
jump, and part-prepared jump plots can be obtained from some starports.
This service is often provided free by Class A and B ports but unlikely
to be available elsewhere. The port benefits from greater control over
exactly where in the system ships jump from and often has an agreement
with nearby destinations about emergence points. A ship using a part-prepared plot cannot falsify its destination, which is beneficial for general
security and reduction of illicit activity.
```

```
Preparing a jump plot takes 1Dx10 minutes and requires an Easy (4+)
Astrogator check with a negative DM equal to the jump number in
parsecs. Using a part-prepared plot reduces the difficulty to Simple (2+)
and time to finalise the plot to 1Dx2 minutes. Naval ships with multiple
```

```
11
```

astrogators often begin preparing jump plots to likely destinations as
soon as they arrive in a system and any ship expecting combat will have
an emergency jump plot kept at a near-final state. This requires constant
updates and absorbs the attention of an astrogator but can save a ship
that is taking a pounding.

READYING THE DRIVE



Entry into jumpspace requires an enormous amount of energy. This is
usually obtained by burning a large quantity of fuel very rapidly in a high-yield power system. Such a power generation device is normally part of
the jump drive fitted to a starship and is considered a drive component
rather than part of the ship's power plant. The jump power unit is unsuited
to the task of powering shipboard systems in the long term but can be
cannibalised to repair a damaged power plant at the price of making the
jump drive inoperable.

There are alternatives to the high-yield power plant. Some ships have
capacitors or batteries that can be used to power a jump. Ever since
the development of the black globe generator, the tactic of using energy
gained from incoming fire hitting the globe to power a jump has been
used – in this case the ship takes fire until its capacitors are full enough
to make an emergency jump. The globe has to be dropped to jump
however, so there is a chance of the jump field being disrupted by further
hits with catastrophic results.

Despite the risks this is a viable strategy for a ship that cannot otherwise
escape. A theoretical variant on this gambit is to use a black globe to fill
its capacitors using a star's normal energy output, then move clear of the
star's gravity well and make a jump. It is not known if this method has
been used successfully.

However the energy is obtained, there must be sufficient to operate the
drive. A power loss during jump initiation can be severely dangerous to
the vessel if the crew are very lucky – more commonly it is instantly fatal.
This is another reason why jumping under fire is risky.

To prepare a jump, the drive is brought online and held in a 'warm' or
'pre-initiation' stage. This uses energy from the ship's power plant and
does not consume jump fuel but the drive's 'warm' status is detectable to
other vessels. A drive can be held in the warm state indefinitely but this
increases wear and therefore maintenance costs. Most ships therefore
run with their jump drive 'cold' most of the time. Warming the drive, more
correctly termed 'advancing to pre-initiation status' takes 2Dx5 minutes.
The multiplier can be reduced by the Effect of an Average (8+) Engineer (J-drive) check, to a minimum of 2D minutes.

If circumstances require it, a cold jump drive can be crash-started in 1D
minutes if a Difficult (10+) Engineer (J-drive) check is made. Failure takes
the drive offline for 3D minutes, after which another attempt can be made.

12

```
When the ship is ready to jump, the drive is brought to the 'hot' or 'initiation
ready' state. This does not consume fuel but can only be maintained for
2D minutes. The ship must initiate jump during this time or abort. A ship
can be held 'hot' for an additional 2D minutes if the engineer makes an
Average (8+) check. Failure results in the drive suffering increased wear
and undergoing an emergency shutdown. At the very least this requires
2Dx10 minutes to recalibrate and restart the drive, however on a straight
2D roll of 12 the drive also suffers a critical hit of D3 Severity.
```

```
When the ship is ready to jump, the process is initiated with an Engineer
check, modified by the Effect of the Astrogator check. The jump-entry
process takes 1Dx10 minutes, although most of this is spent powering
up the ship's jump field projectors and ensuring their output matches the
requirements of the jump plot. Actual entry to jump is almost instantaneous
and the initiation process can be brought down considerably.
```

```
Jump Checks
Type of Jump Engineer Check Time
Normal Easy (4+) 1Dx10 minutes
Expedited Routine (6+) 1Dx5 minutes
Rushed Average (8+) 1Dx3 minutes
Emergency Difficult (10+) 1Dx2 minutes
Crash Very Difficult (12+) 1D minutes
```

```
If this Engineer check is failed a misjump will occur.
```

```
If the jump is successful, the vessel will spend approximately 168 hours (one week) in total isolation in jump space before returning to the normal
universe. Variance is normally plus or minus 12-24 hours, leading to the
Travellers' adage that 'more than a day and it's not okay' – a ship that
comes out of jump too early or too late has usually misjumped.
```

```
The emergence point can also vary. A good one parsec jump will bring
the vessel out within 3,000km of the intended emergence point. Variance
increases with jump distance, although the exact relationship is not clear.
It is probable that the degree of variance is dependent on the square of
the jump distance – so a good six parsec jump will have a maximum
variance of 108,000km, 36 times as much as a one parsec jump. This
is a very small error given the distances involved but can be significant.
It is probable that more advanced jump drives will reduce variance or
eliminate it entirely.
```

```
The laws of conservation of mass and energy continue to operate on
ships that have jumped; when a ship exits jump space it retains the
speed and direction that it had when it jumped. Many ships, especially
commercial vessels, reduce their velocity to zero before jumping for
safety reasons. However, a considerable amount of time can be shaved
```

```
13
```

off a trip by accelerating all the way to the jump point and plotting a jump
that brings the vessel out heading for the target world. It is necessary
to leave enough margin to slow down, which makes jump variance a
hazard on very tightly plotted trips.

GRAVITY AND OTHER EFFECTS



Although a ship in jump space is not affected by the outside universe
in any detectable way, gravity has significant effects on the operation
of a jump drive. The general rule of thumb for starship crews is that
attempting to jump from within 100 diameters of a planet or star is highly
dangerous and doing so from within 10 diameters is suicide.

In fact, the diameter of an object is far less important than its gravitational
forces and how those forces interact with those of other bodies. A large
but not very dense object will have a smaller gravitational force than a
small but dense object – 100 diameters of a black hole is not very far at
all but its jump-hazard radius is much larger. However, the 100-diameter
rule is a useful guide under most circumstances.

Attempting to jump within 100 diameters of a typical planet imposes DM-on the Engineer check to make a safe jump entry. Jumping within 10
diameters imposes DM-12 and virtually guarantees a misjump. All known
attempts to use a jump drive on the surface of a planet or moon have
resulted in disaster. At the least the jump drive is destroyed, sometimes
in an explosion that takes the surrounding craft with it. There is no record
of anything entering jump in this manner, although there are rumors of
'jump platforms' built by advanced species that do allow it. This is more
than likely a wild Travellers' tale.

More intense gravity fields such as those associated with stars and large
gas giants can completely inhibit the use of a jump drive, as can areas of
complex gravitational interaction. For example, the net gravitational force
experienced by an object at a Lagrange point may be zero but it is still
within multiple gravity wells. The fact that a ship would not drift towards a
gravity source does not mean it is safe to jump from that point.

To achieve a safe jump it is necessary to move to a position where net
gravitational force has fallen below the threshold where it can affect the
jump drive. There may actually not be a lower limit, as such, and this could
be the reason for much of the jump variance experienced by Travellers –
the gravitational forces on a ship may not be enough to cause a misjump
but are sufficient to throw the plot off slightly. The only way to avoid this
would be to travel far from the source of gravitational forces – in other
words to go halfway to the next star system before jumping.

It is not possible to jump into or through an area of high gravitation or
significant gravitational interactions. Such areas are said to be 'jump
masked' and require a normal-space transit from the nearest safe
emergence point. A jump plotted into or through such an area will result

14

```
in precipitation at or close to the 100-diameter limit. A badly calculated
plot that intersects the gravitational masking zone of an outsystem gas
giant will result in the ship being precipitated out of jump there rather than
at the destination – but the jump will still take the normal one week plus
or minus whatever variance is experienced.
```

```
A vessel that loses power to its jump drive whilst in jump space is doomed.
Minor fluctuations can cause 'jump space intrusions' as the jump field
partially collapses. These can have profound physical and psychological
effects on personnel and cause serious damage to a ship. A ship that has
enough fuel or power to enter jump but not enough to maintain its jump
field will experience a collapse of the jump field. Presumably the ship will
be destroyed; no-one has survived to say otherwise.
```

```
The jump plot can be thrown off by problems with the drive or damage
from weapons fire or other sources taken whilst the field is forming. Being
hit with the jump drive active can result in a catastrophic energy release
and the destruction of the ship. Even if it does not, the damage suffered
can disrupt the jump field and cause a gradual collapse during transit.
To stabilize the jump field, the ship's engineer can make a Difficult (10+)
Engineer (J-drive) check, with success indicating the jump has not been
significantly affected.
```

TRACKING AND



```
DETECTING JUMPS


The arrival of a ship in a star system is indicated by a 'jump flash' or 'jump
flare' from the collapsing jump field and a 'gravity wave' caused by the
fact a mass is present that was not previously there. These phenomena
are normally obvious to a ship with functioning sensors, out to about
300,000km, requiring only a Routine (6+) Electronics (sensors) check (EDU) or (INT). Consult the Jump Detection table for the difficulty of
detecting a ship at greater distances. Beyond this distance the arrival
might not be picked up.
```

```
Jump Detection
Distance in KM Difficulty
0-300,000 Routine (6+)
300,001-3 000,000 Average (8+)
3,000,001- 30,000,000 Difficult (10+)
30,000,001-300,000,000 Very Difficult (12+)
300,000 000+ Formidable (14+)
```

```
Detection beyond 300,000,000km is unlikely without specialized
equipment. Craft trying to be stealthy may plot their arrival to occur
```

```
15
```

behind a moon or planet, screening the emergence from sensors whose
location is known. There is always a chance of being spotted by a mobile
patrol, however.

The size of a vessel also affects how easy it is to detect.

PREDICTING JUMPS



The easiest way to predict a ship's destination is to require vessels to use
part-prepared jump plots. This has the advantage that all ships from a
particular port will arrive at a specific arrival point. The 'point' in this case

is a volume of space defined by standard jump variance. A ship claiming
to be from that port that does not arrive in the expected emergence zone
will attract attention, although the reasons may be entirely innocent.
```

```
If the ship has calculated its own jump plot, its destination has to be
predicted using a mix of sensor data and detective work. The vessel's
known capabilities will rule out some destinations and destinations that
are masked or otherwise not available can also be ignored. If the vessel
is presumed to be headed for an inhabited world, its destination can be
deduced with a reasonable chance of success.
```

```
If the destination must be determined from jump parameters alone, the
task is much harder. The emissions of the drive must be analysed to gain
an indication of the destination, giving a result that might be anything
but precise. Matching parameters against partial plots for known worlds
within reach can give a high-confidence result but the target ship might
have jumped to any point of any star system within range.
```

```
Parameter Matching requires 3D minutes per world or volume of
space. An Average (8+) Astrogator check is made and if successful the
analysis indicates if there is a match or not. This will confirm if the target
ship jumped to a particular world or indicate that it did not but yields no
other information.
```

```
Full Analysis requires 2Dx10 minutes. An Average (8+) Astrogator check
must be made. If it is failed, the analysis produces no useful results. If it
is successful, roll 2D and add the Effect of the check.

analysis was wrong and a false conclusion has been reached. On a
certain result the Referee should inform the Travellers of the destination
but may still wish to make a secret roll just to keep them wondering if they
are about to embark on a wild goose chase.

##### RESCUE ON RUIE

```
Location: Ruie (C776977-7) Regina subsector, Spinward Marches
```

```
The Travellers are sent by the owning family of Oberlindes, nobles
primarily noted for operating a shipping line active in the Spinward
Marches, to locate and retrieve a member of the family who has gone
missing on Ruie. The subject has fallen foul of local laws and is currently
held in a high-security prison. The Travellers are instructed to free the
subject and return him to his home by any means necessary. They have
a free hand to do as they think best but will be disavowed if caught.
```

```
BACKGROUND


The following information is for the use of the Referee. Much of it can be
obtained by the Travellers through various means. The Referee should
pass out the information to the Travellers as they earn it but should also
bear in mind that some sources are unreliable or contain distortions of the
truth. This is especially true where a government or other organization
controls what information is made public.
```

```
Ruie
Ruie is a heavily populated, high-mid-tech world lying on the Spinward
Main in the Regina subsector. Its land masses are unusually fragmented,
with multiple continents and islands, and this pattern is repeated in its
nations and polities. Ruie is heavily balkanised, with polities ranging
from global superpowers to small city-states occupying a single island or
awkward corner of a larger land mass.
```

```
Ruie's atmosphere is tainted but the world is otherwise very habitable,
with plenty of surface water and a moderate climate. It was colonized
early during Imperial expansion into the region but declined entry into
the Imperium as the Spinward Marches was developed as a sector. As
a result, despite being located close to Regina which became a major
trade and political hub, Ruie went its own way and progressed slowly
using only locally available technology and resources.
```

```
Today, Ruie's many states range in attitude towards the Imperium from
open hostility to friendly and cordial relations. The starport region is
generally pro-Imperial and friendly to starfarers but some areas of the
planet are openly or quietly hostile to offworlders. The latter is a serious
danger to unwary Travellers, and for this reason is designated an Amber
travel zone.

Jingarlu and the Comors Union
The two most pro-Imperial states on Ruie are Jingarlu and the Comors
Union. Both have spaceports accessible directly from the orbital highport
and receive a significant number of offworld visitors. These states and
their allies have benefited from offworld trade and have developed a
mature TL7 economy with some higher-tech goods available as imports.
They are considered safe to visit and outside the Amber zone applied to
the world as a whole.

The development of Jingarlu and the Comors Union was largely
supported by fossil fuels, imported in great quantities from the
neighboring state of Nebelthorn. However, in recent years the
acquisition of alternative power sources and machinery for creating
synthetic oil has greatly reduced the dependence of these nations on
Nebelthorn, enabling them to move free of its influence. As Jingarlu
and the Union have become more prosperous and less amenable
to petrochemical-based strongarming, they have also increased in
prosperity whilst resentment within Nebelthorn has grown in proportion.

Nebelthorn
Nebelthorn is one of the larger states on Ruie and one of the least
friendly to Imperials. The nation is ruled by an oppressive hereditary
dictatorship led by the Eldenn family, which has been in power for
the past 120 years. Nebelthorn appears to lag behind the technology
enjoyed by most other states on Ruie and this impression is partially
correct; the generally available Tech Level in Nebelthorn is TL6 and
most of its armed forces are equipped to this level. However, some
elite formations and the upper echelons of society have access to
more advanced items. This technological elitism comes at a price of
oppression and deep social divides.

Law in Nebelthorn is highly subjective and based on social class.
It protects the upper echelons of society first and foremost, and then
those who support them such as law enforcement and civic officials.
Outsiders such as offworlders or those from non-favored neighboring
states are actively legislated against, making Nebelthorn one of the most
hazardous areas of Ruie to visit. Ample information is available at the
starport about which states are friendly to Travellers, which are neutral
and which should be avoided. The starport authorities have a policy of
not getting involved in the affairs of those who ignore the warnings.

LIBRARY DATA


The following information is widely available through data terminals
and standard encyclopaediae. It can be considered to be reasonably
accurate as far as it goes but simple common sense should indicate that
publicly available information is unlikely to be the whole story.
```

```
Oberlindes Lines
Oberlindes Lines is a well-established company owned by the Oberlindes
family. Starting out as a single-ship independent interstellar shipping
concern, the company has grown over the centuries into a major player
in the Spinward Marches' freighting and passenger industries. Unlike
many merchant lines, Oberlindes has always made a practice of seeking
new markets across Imperial borders and maintains strong cross-border
links with the Vargr Extents.
```

```
In the immediate aftermath of the Fourth Frontier War, Oberlindes Lines
underwent rapid expansion using surplus naval transports, significantly
contributing to the economic recovery of the border subsectors. The
Oberlindes family was recognized by the Emperor for this contribution
to the regional economy and currently the firm is well-respected for its
success and importance to the economic well-being of worlds along the
Imperial border.
```

```
THE SITUATION


All information beyond this point is for the use of the Referee. Any or all
of it can be offered to the Travellers when appropriate but the version
presented may not be complete, accurate or free from bias.
```

```
Sergei hault-Oberlindes is the 20-year-old son of the head of the
Oberlindes family, Marc Oberlindes. As part of his education he was
undertaking a 'grand tour' of the coreward end of the Spinward Marches.
There were many opportunities for amusement and pleasure but the
overall intent was to broaden Sergei's horizons and give him a better
perspective of the region the company operates in. Unfortunately,
Sergei's judgement had not kept pace with his itinerary and he landed
himself in trouble.
```

```
Sergei decided to visit the pro-Imperial parts of Ruie, which went well
enough but whilst in Jingarlu he learned of the Daccam Ruins, not
far over the border into Nebelthorn. Fascinated by the idea of seeing
unique remains of an extinct alien culture, Sergei overruled his crew's
concerns and waved aside warnings. Somehow obtaining a visa to
enter Nebelthorn – no easy task – he set off over the border and soon
afterward contact ceased.
```

```
The increasingly concerned crew of Sergei's ship were unable to get
a straight answer out of the Nebelthorn authorities about what had
```

```
21
```

happened to him and requests for visas to carry out a search were refused.
Eventually a statement was made via the Jingarlu embassy that Sergei
hault-Oberlindes had been convicted of assaulting a law enforcement
officer and sentenced to 30 years' hard labour. With no other options the
crew left Ruie and reported back to company headquarters.

Oberlindes agents were dispatched to Ruie, where they learned that
Sergei had indeed landed himself in jail. Apparently he had met a young
woman of low standing and became friendly with her, objecting when
a Nebelthorn police officer manhandled her in typical routine brutality.
Sergei tried to defend his lady and was subsequently arrested. By local
standards he received a fair trial, although there was never any doubt as
to the outcome and the matter has been handled quite legally.

Nebelthorn has shown no interest in negotiating a release and has
rebuffed or ignored all offers of favorable trade deals and even direct
bribery. Marc Oberlindes has exhausted all legal avenues trying to free
his son and, although he acknowledges the situation is of Sergei's own
making, has resolved to liberate his son by any means necessary.

THE MISSION



Oberlindes Lines has determined that Sergei is being held in a high-security prison in a remote area and wants to stage a rescue. However,
the operation must be deniable so using the company's own assets is not
an option. Oberlindes Lines will provide transportation to Ruie aboard an
independent starship – whose crew are not involved in the mission and
have no idea why the Travellers are really there – along with equipment
and weaponry. Extraction will be by means of a second ship deployed
after the operation begins in order to preserve security.

The Travellers have complete autonomy to act as they see fit, so long as
Sergei is returned safely to his family. Oberlindes Lines does not want
to know the details and will deny all responsibility or involvement if the
Travellers are caught. The Travellers are advised to operate covertly
and cause a minimum of damage but how they accomplish the task is
immaterial. If Sergei is returned safely to his family the Travellers will be
well rewarded.

The exact nature of the reward on offer depends on the Travellers' needs
and level of equipment. Oberlindes has several far traders and would
agree to loan one to the Travellers for a year, paying all maintenance and
running costs. Alternatively, a financial reward might be more suitable;
Sergei's freedom is worth at least Cr100,000 in Oberlindes stock, plus
a cash amount in the region of Cr10,000 each. Other rewards could
be negotiated if the Travellers have particular interests. A company
like Oberlindes Lines has enormous political power and can obtain
information from sources beyond the reach of most Travellers.

22

```
Outfitting and Equipment
The Travellers can take whatever they like to Ruie, providing it can
be carried aboard a small merchant ship. Oberlindes Lines will pay
expenses through an untraceable account. Any items the Travellers
bring will be offloaded at Ruie's starport and subject to local laws once
there. However, it is customary for starports to offer an 'external storage
service', which means items legal elsewhere, but not locally, can be
stored at the port without falling under local jurisdiction.
```

```
Despite being outside Imperial territory Ruie has such a provision, which
enables the Travellers to get equipment onto the planet. They will have to
somehow arrange for equipment to be moved from the port to the 'interior'
of the world, the easiest way being to conceal items within a vehicle
and transfer planetside via the local port at Jingarlu. Local scanners are
greatly inferior to those used at Imperial starports and the Travellers may
come up with all manner of other ways of solving this problem.
```

```
Crossing the Nebelthorn Border
There are two obvious ways to reach the prison. One is to illegally cross
the border from Jingarlu and travel covertly. The other is to take a shuttle
to Nebelthorn's spaceport and travel from there.
```

```
Using the Spaceport: Getting a flight to Nebelthorn' spaceport from any
of the world's ports or its highport is easy enough, although the Travellers
may receive some friendly warnings. At Nebelthorn, local law is in force
```

```
23
```

from the moment the shuttle doors open and it is draconian. Those without
visas to enter the state are (grudgingly) permitted to conduct business
at the port but obtaining a visa is virtually impossible and without one
the Travellers will have to somehow sneak past a very heavy security
contingent or fight their way through it – which would bring an escalating
response that can only end one way.

It is possible that clever Travellers will come up with a way to get around
this problem. However, the Referee should note that local people – even
the very large proportion who dislike their government – are not receptive
to helping offworlders. This is partly due to an ingrained dislike resulting
from endless propaganda and partly because the penalties for any act
of defiance, especially helping despised offworlders, is very severe.
Very good diplomacy and persuasion skills will be required, along with
significant incentives. It can be done but will not be easy.

Covert Border Crossing: The Nebelthorn border is a simple fence,
monitored by TL6 electrical devices that do little more than detect when
a section has been cut. These are extremely easy to bypass even with
basic tools and with a little preparation the Travellers can get through the
fence without difficulty. A road runs parallel to the fence, permitting patrol
vehicles to monitor the border and there are occasional overflights as
well. These are highly infrequent, however; if a plane has swept the area
in the past three days, the chances of another overflight are very small.

If the Travellers want to take a vehicle across the border, this might pose
problems. A grav vehicle can simply fly over, of course, but ground vehicles
leave tracks, which will be spotted if not obscured – and they require a
big breach in the fence, which will be harder to conceal. Nevertheless,
bringing a vehicle across is entirely feasible. Alternatively, the Travellers
might obtain one within Nebelthorn. Locals will be unreceptive to loaning
their property to spacefaring adventurers who happen by but could be
persuaded or intimidated. Theft is also an option.

Triggering an Alert
The initial response to any alert will be made by local forces. This
usually means no more than four law enforcement officers with sidearms
and possibly shotguns or rifles. Law enforcement is paramilitary in
Nebelthorn, especially near the border, and cooperation with the armed
forces tends to be close. A minor alert such as being detected cutting the
border fence or leaving vehicle tracks near it will provoke only a go-and-investigate response by a single patrol but any violent incident will result
in an escalating response.

At first, a response will be locally available forces in light vehicles, armed
with smallarms and perhaps a machinegun. TL6 aircraft are available and
will be sent to undertake reconnaissance in the event of a major incident (such as someone firing upon guards investigating a border breach). These

24

```
will be followed by the full weight of the Nebelthorn military if necessary.
If the Travellers pose a sufficient threat that a truckload of troops cannot
deal with them, the next level of response is wheeled armored cars with
autocannon and perhaps even an airstrike, with tanks as a further level of
escalation if the Travellers hang around long enough.
```

```
In short, Nebelthorn is absolutely intolerant of anyone shooting at its
border or security patrols and will throw the full resources of a TL6
nation at a serious threat. This will take time to organise, however,
so the Travellers may be able to escape before a heavy response
materialises. If so, they are likely to see aircraft searching for them and
once located their position will be reported to ground forces who will
attempt to apprehend them. 'Apprehend' can mean recover the bodies
as evidence of an offworlder threat or international incident; Nebelthorn
is not particularly choosy about taking offenders alive.
```

```
The clock begins ticking the moment the Travellers are detected. If the
incident is low-key, build-up will be slow and they should have time to
escape or continue with the mission. However, once shots are fired
the escalation will be quick and the Travellers will find themselves on a
strictly limited time frame before truckloads of troops start arriving from
the nearest military base.
```

```
THE PRISON


The prison is located on a small plateau kept barren of vegetation by
chain gangs from the prison itself. It is surrounded by a double outer
fence, with a 15 meters clear zone in between. There are guard towers at
the corners and mid points of the fence, and a small security compound
at the gate. These lie in the space between the two fences.
```

```
The fences are electrified. The outer one is designed to be lethal and
will deliver sufficient charge to cause 6D damage per round to anyone
touching it. There are no warning signs but astute Travellers might spot
the low safety fences (to protect guards patrolling between the fences)
and vegetation around the base of each fence. The inner fence delivers
only 2D damage per round.
```

```
The fences are also monitored by basic electronic sensors, which can
detect a voltage drop (such as when someone is being electrocuted) or
if the major wires of the fence are cut. Patrols – usually pairs of guards
```

- walk the perimeter at what are supposed to be variable intervals. In
practice, the guards are complacent and have fallen into routine.

```
The prison itself consists of two main cell blocks, an administrative
complex where the guards are housed and a smaller cell block in one
corner of the compound. The latter is an afterthought and creates a gap
in otherwise good sight lines from the roof of the admin complex.
```

```
25
```

The small cell block is for female prisoners and designed to house around

100. It is at present heavily overcrowded. The two large cell blocks are
for male prisoners and designed to house 500 each. These are under
capacity at present, with around 350 men in each. Should the Travellers
investigate, a large contingent of the prison population were taken away
as workers on a government project a few weeks ago.

Prisoners are a mixed lot. Some are genuine criminals and of those a
proportion are in jail for horrific crimes. Most are guilty of relatively petty
offences such as theft or political dissent. There are very few potential
revolutionaries at the prison; these are mostly ordinary citizens who fell
foul of oppressive laws. They may hate their government but the vast
majority are concerned only with their own welfare and not receptive to
being turned into a revolutionary army.

Guards are, for the most part, callous and contemptuous of prisoners,
who by definition now belong to an inferior social class. Some enjoy
brutalising the inmates but most are just doing a job that brings enhanced
social status and a decent wage. They are well aware that most prisoners
hate them and many will do violence at the first opportunity, so guards
tend to err on the side of caution and shoot before asking questions.

Getting Into The Prison
There are numerous ways of getting inside the prison fence. The guards
are basically competent but complacent. They will notice the obvious,
such as a group of 'new guards' in ill-fitting uniforms and with strange
accents claiming they have come to join the prison's complement but
can be duped with some care. It might be possible to convince the prison
administration that Sergei is to be transferred elsewhere or released
into the Travellers' custody. This would require forged documents and a
convincing performance; the prison has both a landline and radio link to
the capital and the governor can easily check any story the Travellers try
to feed him.

Stealth is always an option. Again, the guards are not expecting trouble
so maintain only routine watchfulness. The Travellers may be able to
get past the fences and into the compound undetected but it is not just
the guards they have to worry about. Inmates are unlikely to just sit in
their cells whilst someone else is broken out. The Travellers may have to
strike bargains or release prisoners in return for their silence.

Mayhem is also an option and will probably occur sooner or later. The
Travellers can be out of the prison and away before reinforcements
arrive, so long as they do not become bogged down in protracted
firefights. They are likely to be heavily outnumbered but not necessarily
outgunned, and releasing a mob of violent criminals will contribute to the
overall confusion. Indeed, the Travellers might even find a way to make
the incident look like an internal prison break rather than a rescue.

Rescuing Sergei
Sergei is in one of the prison blocks. Locating him would be easy if the
Travellers had access to the prison records. If not, they may need to
interrogate a guard or ask other prisoners. Information will not be given
up freely by either. Although the Travellers know what Sergei looks like,
months in prison have not been kind to him and he is one of about 700
men in prison coveralls, all in identical cells on identical corridors.

How the Travellers locate Sergei is up to them but once they do there is
an additional complication. His ladyfriend is also in the prison and he will
not leave without her; she is in the womens' block. Sergei received some
personal defence training from Oberlindes Lines security personnel and
is capable of handling a weapon. He has scores to settle with a couple of
guards and prisoners, and is determined to rescue his lover or die trying.
The Travellers will have to decide what to do about this and quickly...

EXFILTRATION AND AFTERMATH



In a perfect universe the Travellers would sneak or bluff their way in,
extract Sergei and his girlfriend, and drive off without incident before
making a convenient rendezvous to get off-planet. Few Travellers live in

28

```
such a pleasant universe, however, so more than likely they will have to
withdraw from the prison under fire, with a response from local military
bases beginning to emerge. The border is only a few kilometers away,
so a dramatic chase may well ensue, involving aircraft and hordes of
Nebelthorn soldiers. The pursuit might not end at the border, which
would result in an international incident and maybe even a war. Marc
Oberlindes cares little about that, compared to getting his son safely
back, but would prefer to avoid it.
```

```
The Travellers' contacts are not willing to violate Nebelthorn territory
to pick them up as this could have legal consequences but will make
a pickup once the border is crossed. Questions might be asked if this
leads to being strafed by Nebelthorn planes but a typical free trader
is all but impervious to TL6 aircraft guns. There is also the question
of what happens to any other prisoners who escape from the facility
and diplomatic problems between Nebelthorn and its neighbors. The
Referee must resolve these matters according to the seriousness of the
incident the Travellers cause. Fortunately, Ruie is not an Imperial world
and Nebelthorn has an anti-Imperial stance, so Imperial authorities will
not be greatly interested in an incident there. The Travellers might be
wise not to go back, however...
```

```
Referee's Notes
The Travellers can solve a lot of problems with advanced technology.
Forging documents, disabling sensors and intercepting communications
are all relatively easy with the right technology. The Travellers' handcomps
and comms have more processing power than the whole state of
Nebelthorn and most locals are not really aware of what interstellar tech
can do. Used imaginatively, the Travellers' personal gadgetry gives them
enormous advantages over the locals.
```

```
The Travellers might choose instead to leverage a firepower advantage.
Faced with fearsome space-weapons the guards are likely to back off
and hunker down rather than charge to their deaths. Again, creative
use of advanced technology might enable the Travellers to intimidate
the guards and avoid bloodshed. A straightforward assault is an option,
although this might pique Imperial interest depending on what equipment
is used. A bunch of yahoos causing a ruckus on some trans-border
backwater is of no consequence but an attack on a sovereign state by
battle dress-equipped Travellers, ending in a pitched battle and half an
armored division destroyed... that will attract notice.
```

```
Classic Traveller adventures often ended with a statement that
'subsequent events are at the discretion of the Referee'. That remains
as true today as when Traveller was first published. Who knows what the
long-term result of Sergei Oberlindes' rescue might be?

Cartridge Laser Weapons

Laser weapons can bring a high level of destruction to the battlefield but
at lower Tech Levels, are constrained by the necessity for a bulky power
pack. The earliest laser weapons may require a small but heavy back-pack to provide enough power and even more advanced models need a
weighty belt-mounted pack that remains uncomfortable and restricting.

Cartridge laser weapons dispense with the need for a power pack by
using what is effectively a magazine that provides the necessary energy
to fire the weapon via chemical reaction. This greatly reduces the overall
weight of the weapon, albeit at the cost of fewer shots. However, the
cartridge is no slower to replace than a slug magazine and is disposable
meaning no lengthy recharges are required.

##### RELIGION IN THE TWO THOUSAND WORLDS

```
Like most intelligent races, the K'kree have evolved elaborate religious
beliefs to help explain their place in the universe, the purpose of life
and the promise of the future. The K'kree, among the most conservative
of the major races, are unique in several ways when it comes to the
question of religion and philosophy.
```

```
First, they are more closely rooted in the traditional beliefs of their
ancestors than any of the other major races. K'kree religion and
philosophical thought have been less affected by the developments
of science, particularly by exposure to non-K'kree beliefs, than is the
case with any of the other major races. The religious principles of their
forefathers have been handed down almost unchanged from the earliest
K'kree civilizations, over a period of several thousand years (as if we on
Earth worshipped Ra in the manner of the early Egyptians).
```

```
Secondly, the K'kree religion is monolithic. Like their government, the
K'kree religion is a universal 'state religion', not fragmented as with most
other star-faring societies. There are few K'kree who do not subscribe
to the same beliefs and two K'kree theologians from opposite ends of
the Two Thousand Worlds could exchange views without disagreement
or controversy.
```

```
Finally, the K'kree religion is, by our standards, an undemonstrative
one. Like Taoism in Earth's China, the K'kree religion is less a way of
worship than a way of thought and belief. While K'kree religious writings
abound in myths and legends, there is a definite belief in divinity and
divine purpose. The K'kree never seem to have evolved the notion that
their deities could be swayed by prayer, offerings, promises or good
behaviour. As suits a harsh and militant people, the divine play is distant,
inscrutable and unrelenting.
```

```
The K'kree religion is a fatalistic one, in which the concepts of 'fate' or
'kar ma' from terrestrial religions would be very much appropriate. The
K'kree believe that most of what happens has been long since preor-dained and is quite unchangeable by any mortal agency. This fatalism,
however, is tempered by an absolute faith in their own glorious destiny. In
accordance with the basic concept of the group being far more important
than the individuals that make it up, the K'kree believe that no number of
reverses, crises or individual tragedies can prevent the K'kree race from
fulfilling its ordained role. Thus, fatalism does not hamper them; instead
it makes them almost fanatical. If a K'kree soldier has been fated to die,
he will die... no amount of running from destiny will stop him from being
killed. Thus, he is more inclined to put his every effort into the battle. The
same is true of all of K'kree life. As befits their natures, the religion of the
```

```
31
```

K'kree is perhaps the most supremely polytheistic religion practiced by
any race anywhere. The K'kree believe that each and every living K'kree
is the worldly counterpart of a divine being. The religion holds that there
is an ideal universe, somewhere in time and space, in which all K'kree
who ever were (or will ever be) live. It is a single, immense prairie on
which all can live in complete peace and harmony, under a divine Step-pelord who rules over all equally.

Each mortal K'kree is a living embodiment of his respective divine
counterpart, born into the world for the dual purpose of carrying forward
the divine plan for this shadow world and of testing the individual's
worth. These divine K'kree become mortal once, live out a lifetime in this
universe (which is but an instant in their own) and then return when their
part is done. The way in which they stood up to the trails of this universe
determines their standing in the other.

Details of these concepts are hard to translate to the human mind.
There seems to be little concept of a 'good' or 'evil' life, or of rewards
or punishments handed out for conduct. Ethics and morals are not so
much the object of judgment as the ability of the individual to play his
part without com plaint, doing what needs to be done. In many respects,
these religious concepts can be acquainted with certain philosophical
teachings of Terra's ancient Greek and Roman cultures, particularly
certain Plato's doctrines (see especially The Republic Book VII) and
some aspects of stoic philosophy.

That the K'kree believe themselves to be reflections of divine beings
in temporary mortal form is an interesting concept. It is the basis for
their extremely rigid dislike of other races, for the K'kree religion makes
no provision for non K'kree in their paradise world. Thus, all non-K'kree
they meet, no matter how intelligent, are of the shadow world (the
physical universe) alone and hence inherently inferior. Yet the K'kree
know themselves to be mortal in this life; their divine essence is no more
and no less immortal than the human concept of the soul. The shape
of the divine plan for this 'shadow world' in which the K'kree live out
their mortal lives is also an interesting one. The closest approximation
to the K'kree belief possible in human terms and the approximation is by
no means exact, is that the K'kree come into this world to shape it into
a new paradise, into which some other people will eventually emerge
and, in turn, descend into another 'shadow world' to shape its progress
towards paradise. It is an infinitely repeating cycle of creation through a
multitude of universes. Just who is to inherit this universe is hard to say;
some K'kree writings seem to indicate it is another race of K'kree but
a few translations could be interpreted to mean that it is some K'kree
client race that will ultimately emerge as the 'divinities' who will descend
into the next shadow world from ours. This would seem to be at the
core of the K'kree efforts to shape certain subject races into a pattern
conforming with their own ways. All other shadow races are, of course,
nothing but obstacles in this life to be overcome.

32

```
K'kree religious belief, at least among
the leaders, was badly strained by the
results of the Hiver-K'kree War. In
that war, the Hivers threatened to
use psychohistorical techniques
to undermine the very fabric of
K'kree society... and they offered
convincing proof of their ability
to carry the threat out. This was
clearly at odds with the concept
of the divine plan. The K'kree
backed down from the conflict
but the details of the true nature
of the conflict were never made
public. A certain weakening of
the faith in the upper classes
of K'kree society seems to have
taken place but their conservative
nature made the idea of religious
innovation unthinkable.
```

```
By and large, today's K'kree still
adhere strongly to the faith, although
belief is weakest among the upper
classes. The practical aspects of the
religion – the influences on behaviour –
are largely independent of actual belief in
the principles of the religion itself. K'kree
are encouraged to be stoic, obe dient, willing
and to live their lives in a way that will bring
them merit (by accepting and overcoming
everything that life throws in their path).
```

```
Religion is a private matter; as was mentioned before, worship is not as
important to the religion as living a life in accordance with the principles
of the faith. This is reasonable when one considers that the K'kree deities
are the K'kree themselves and anything paralleling worship or veneration
of a 'patron deity' is a highly personal and private matter indeed (one of
the few uses of the concept of 'privacy' in K'kree culture).
```

```
Many members of the Merchant caste (and a few Nobles) are theologians;
they write on a variety of speculative religious topics, theorize on the
nature of Paradise or the lesser shadow worlds and so forth. Such
theology is strictly a part-time pursuit, a hobby; there is no organised
K'kree church structure or true priesthood. Still, theologians of note are
well-respected and accrue benefits from their station (reduced meal
prices, invitations to other worlds, free rooms), similar in nature to the
human Travellers' Aid Society.

##### TVASTAR-CLASS MANUFACTORY STARSHIP

The Tvastar design dates from the late Second Imperium. A few ships
date that far back, having remained in operation during the Long Night.
The Tvastar was conceived as being able to deploy all the infrastructure
a new colony would need, by landing and converting itself into said
infrastructure (turning the 3,594 crew into colonists).

The vision was noble, the practice often makeshift. Few colonies
could afford to buy an entire Tvastar and sacrifice it in the name
of colonial infrastructure, although this did happen, usually when
the owners of a Tvastar went bankrupt and those founding a new
colony were able to purchase the ship for Credits on the Megacredit.
Even so, relative to the usual expense and labour of starting a new
colony, sending just one or two Tvastars to land and become a colony
became a textbook example of low effort colonization. The captain
and first officer, traditionally being the pilot and astrogator (trained in
both skills to back each other up), often found their training useless
on the colony; in some cases, they were paid with a yacht built during
the trip for them to fly off and retire with.

Renting a Tvastar, trained factory staff included, was more affordable but
still put a starting colony deep in debt, causing many owners to require
customers to draft plans showing a path to profitability, something most
ideologically-minded would-be colony founders had little experience in.
Successful efforts had to be mercantile, making the Tvastar a symbol of
concentrated wealth being used to make more wealth at the expense
of 'simple, honest folk' who just wanted a new place to live. Increasing
distrust of off-planet megacorporations limited production, until the design
was but archived data to be rediscovered during the Third Imperium.

Tvastars were more often used for disaster recovery or to respond to
market surges that demanded an increase in this or that manufacturing
capacity. One polity during the Long Night was nothing more than a
Tvastar and the colonies it maintained, which lasted until the Tvastar (with
the polity's core technical talent) was destroyed by pirates mistaking it for
a battleship. Attempts have been made to base an entire clan on Tvastars
but as everyone must work, leaving no room for children or the infirm, this
has never lasted long. Tvastars tend to be made in small production runs
and customised by their crews, making every Tvastar unique.

The convex hull – to increase radiative surface area, as a Tvastar runs
somewhat hotter than usual for a ship of its tonnage – has been likened
to mountain ridges in space. A more apt comparison would be valleys in
space; of the six ventral and dorsal voids, the outer four are designated
for receipt of raw asteroids (the redundant cargo nets forming temporary

34

```
airlocks sealed over hatches to facilitate moving asteroids into the giant
central cargo bay), which are sliced, crushed, smelted, forged and
manufactured into a vast array of goods, then transferred to starports or
cargo ships docked to the inner valleys. When building spaceships and
other objects too large to transfer via airlocks, standard procedure is to
construct a temporary hangar from the refinery's reject material. As the
cargo bay is more than a third of a kilometer at its widest, elevator cars
in the fins link to tubes lining the bay walls to facilitate transit without
navigating cargo. Gravity in the spikes is set toward the cargo bay, while
the bay itself is kept in zero-g. A Tvastar sacrificing itself to make a colony
will split along the bay, landing all fins upright, during final planetfall.
```

```
A Tvastar's smelter, refinery and production plants are balanced against
one another. Given a sufficient supply of asteroids, the smelter's entire
average daily ore production is consumed that same day by the refinery.
The refinery's daily output, along with crystals, gems and radioactives
from the smelter, is entirely consumed by the production plants. If
a Tvastar is packed full of asteroids before a jump, the rocks can be
converted to manufactured goods over the next seven days. This runs
into problems in practice, when asteroids do not have an exact yield of
useful materials or a jump may run a day short, or a day long, but on
average it works out.
```

```
Perhaps the most famous Tvastar is the Phoenix 2800, whose five year
voyage saw it launch from Terra, cross the crumbling Rule of Man with
many adventures on the way, carefully sneak across the Vargr Extents
and eventually found the colony Havensmith in far-off Thaku Fung
sector, which would not be officially re-contacted by the Third Imperium
until 1104. It sacrificed just shy of 60% of its plants, refinery, smelter
and asteroid cargo (keeping the proportionate balance) for 60,000 low
berths, 4,200 additional staterooms, 1,800 tons more common areas, 270
further medical bays and a sizable planetary survey scientific operation
suite. Its remaining manufacturing output was devoted to maintaining
and reconfiguring the fleet of ships it acquired during its trip.

##### 'FAST JONNY' MCRAE

```
Jon 'Fast Jonny' McRae is wanted on at least 10 worlds, under a
number of different names, for crimes ranging from grand theft to
impersonating an Imperial Military Officer. A fast-talking, free wheeling
con man, McRae is engaging and likeable, even to the victims of
his elaborate (and usually expensive) scams. Jonny lives well and
enjoys life to the fullest. Wherever he goes, he finds the best foods,
the finest wines and the most beautiful women. This taste for high
living is costly and cuts into the profits of his operations but McRae
is content to work a little longer to recover his expenses. Actually,
McRae's swindles are carried off more as a game than as a necessity;
Jonny's mercurial temperament and dislike of boredom and inactivity
lead him to devising elaborate cons even when he has no immediate
need for cash.
```

```
Certain scams are regular favorites, used frequently. One is to
pose as an inspector employed by some merchant line or consulting
firm (or, on one notable occasion, as a member of the IISS security
branch), deadheading his way from one system to another under
the guise of conducting a 'safety procedures examination'. Similarly,
he has been known to eat magnificent multi-course meals in fine
restaurants, while allowing staff members to think he is the restaurant
reviewer from a local news service – thus getting the meal free, with
fine service to boot. These, however, are just petty games 'to keep
my hand in' as Jonny puts it.
```

```
His real cons are much bigger in scope. McRae has been known to
steal, and later sell, small starships. Often his victims do not realise
that they have been had for weeks. McRae's adventures often net
him millions of Credits from a single sting... which he goes through in
a remarkably short time, often financing a new operation.
```

```
His smooth, polished manner and great personal charm make McRae
a convincing individual. A victim once said of McRae, 'he could talk a
centaur into taking a job as an elevator operator'! Young, good-looking
and utterly disarming in his appearance, Jonny is a great ladies' man;
his success often allows him to latch on to wealthy, well-connected
women and bilk them of large fortunes or use their influence to help
him in one of his schemes.
```

```
41
```

Travellers may encounter 'Fast Jonny' McRae under a variety of
circumstances. Usually, he will approach them in an attempt to con
them or use them as unknowing dupes in some elaborate scam.
Should this happen, he will be quite convincing and the Travellers will
have a great deal of trouble resisting his advances.

This is the general rule, in fact, in all situations involving Jonny McRae.
He always attempts to dominate his surroundings and never tells the
truth if he can fabricate a convincing story of some sort instead. Even
those who are aware of his reputation often find themselves being
taken in by Jonny's charming manner and powers of persuasion.

Other situations involving the Travellers with McRae can be of
interest in a campaign or adventure. For instance, McRae could
be running from the law or some powerful individual he has just
swindled. Jonny could approach the Travellers with some elaborate
story or phony job offer, hoping to use them to get him off-world
or distract pursuit. As a result, those pursuing Jonny can end up
chasing the Travellers as well.

Jonny may also involve the Travellers in a really big scam. For
example, he might hire them as crew for a starship – which they later
realise was stolen.

This, too, could put the Travellers in a bad position.

On the other hand, the Travellers might be hired by the law, a
private individual or even by the local mob, to help track Jonny
down and trap him. Another possibility is that the Travellers will be
caught in the crossfire when Jonny's luck runs out and his enemies
finally run him down.

'Fast Jonny' is brilliant at changing identities. His skill at forgery
and years of experience and travel have enabled him to build up a
large collection of false ID papers. McRae is also good at changing
his appearance (both with and without make-up), and is a talented
actor and mimic.

Among his many aliases, Jonny is most fond of one: Commodore
Laruskaa Korkoran, IN. McRae has built the identity carefully over
the years and exercised care to keep Korkoran's name clear of
the scams he has indulged in. As the commodore, McRae has an
iron-clad protection from suspicion. Korkoran's record shows him
to be brilliant (an Academy honors graduate), a war hero and a
trusted officer. Where records could not easily be faked, McRae

42

```
has carefully covered his trail by associating Korkoran with places,
people and events not easily checked.
```

```
Among his papers McRae has a warrant identifying Korkoran as
an Inspector General on a roving commission to investigate naval
affairs. Because the character of Korkoran is above suspicion,
McRae often uses him as cover for escapes; as yet the deception
has never been discovered.
```

```
Jonny McRae is wanted and considered dangerous. A Cr40000
reward is offered by Imperial authorities for his arrest, in connection
with the time he posed as a marine colonel to gain access to records
of a mineral survey on Prometheus – one of his few failures.
```

```
Other rewards are in effect from various governments and some
wealthy criminal leaders have taken out contracts on him as well.
```

```
In actual fact, although McRae carries a weapon he is quite reluctant
to use it and is far more likely to use his wits and words than force in
any tight corner.

## TRAVELLINGTRAVELLING

##### STOCK EXCHANGE

Steady and careful gains on the stock exchange are not really the stuff
of Traveller adventures but a more aggressive and risky approach to
playing the financial markets might be more in keeping with the spirit of
freewheeling adventure. Events on the stock exchange might provoke
the Travellers to wonder if something is afoot – or they might be the ones
undertaking shady activities in the hope of influencing their stocks or
undermining someone else's.

If the stock exchange is going to be important in a campaign the
Referee will need to decide what stocks are available for trading. These
should include the major companies and corporations involved in the
campaign and must be diverse enough to give the Travellers choices
to make. Worlds of TL4 and below will not have a stock exchange of
this sort, although there may be financial markets at the starport that
are unconnected with wider planetary society. This does not preclude
speculating on local businesses through a convoluted process but in any
case TL4 or lower industries are rarely significant on an interstellar-scale.

Having determined what stocks are available, the operating price for
each must be established. The Referee may choose to set some stock
prices rather than determining them randomly, especially for very large
or important corporations, or companies significant to the campaign.
Deliberately setting some stocks at an attractively low price may entice
Travellers to get involved in stock exchange speculation or to wonder
why this wonderful opportunity has suddenly opened up.

To randomly determine the value of any given stock, roll 2D and multiply
by 10 to give the price per share in Credits. Travellers can buy and sell
any number of shares but for ease of book-keeping it is best to use
multiples of 100 at a time. Fees are levied on every stock transaction.
This is typically 1-2% of the value of the sale or purchase but may be
more in some markets.

Once the starting values of stocks are known, the Referee will need to
determine the movement of share prices over time. This can be done
whenever the Travellers show an interest in the market or the Referee
might follow a schedule of determining changes every game week
regardless of Traveller interest. The latter creates more possibilities for
large changes between Traveller interactions with the stock brokerage
but requires more work on the part of the Referee.

44

```
Each stock offered for sale must be assigned a fluctuation rate that will
indicate how much the share price will change over time. Very stable
companies tend to see steady but unexciting share price changes, with
modest growth being the norm. Some firms are prone to a rather greater
change in their share price, which may indicate temporary conditions or
long-term instability.
```

```
Stable stocks change at a base rate of D3 Credits.
Changeable stocks change at a base rate of 1D Credits.
Volatile stocks change at a base rate of 2D Credits.
```

```
In addition, stocks should be assigned a growth or loss trend. Extreme
rates tend to be short-lived, representing boom, bust or crazy levels of
buying and selling that have caused the market to become unstable.
However, it is the nature of business that the trend is towards steady
growth. Each Trend has a DM associated with it, which will bias the
market back towards a more stable state of modest growth.
```

```
Crashing stocks decline at a rate of 1D+3 times the base rate of
change. Trend DM+6
Plunging stocks decline at a rate of 1D times the base rate of change.
Trend DM+4
Steeply Declining stocks decline at a rate of D3 times the base rate of
change. Trend DM+2
Declining stocks decline at a their base rate. Trend DM+1
Growing stocks increase at their base rate. Trend DM+0
Rapidly Growing stocks increase at D3 times their base rate of
change. Trend DM-2
Exploding stocks increase at 1D times their base rate of change.
Trend DM-4
```

```
45
```

The Referee may choose to alter the trend for any given stock. If random
determination is required, roll 2D and add the change DM:

```
2D + Trend DM Result
2- Trend declines two categories
3-5 Trend declines one category
6-8 Trend remains the same
9-11 Trend increases on category
12+ Trend increases two categories.
```

TRADING


For example, shares in The Interstellar Widget Corporation (TIWC)
start out at Cr70 per share. The Referee decides this is a Changeable
stock, which changes at a rate of 1D Credits per share. The stock is
growing steadily.

After a week the Travellers take a look at the share price to see if they
want to buy more shares in widget production. The stock is growing,
so price increases at its base rate of 1D credits. The Referee rolls an
uninspiring 1; TIWC shares are now worth Cr71.

A week later, the Travellers take a look at the share price at their latest
planetfall. The Referee rolls 2D to determine if the growth trend has
changed. The dice come up a 5 – trend declines one category. TIWC
stock is now Declining, so share price has fallen by the base rate of 1D
Credits. In this case the roll is a 6, so share price is now Cr65.

The Travellers decide to invest, hoping for an upturn in the market, but
the following week the Referee rolls 4 on 2D. Even with DM+1, this
indicates trend declines one category. TIWC shares are now steeply
declining; share price falls at a rate of D3 times the base rate of change.
In this case the Referee gets the maximum result of 3 and 8 – share
price drops by Cr18 to Cr47 each. Naturally, the Travellers decide to
shovel money into this falling stock since they are entirely sure it will
rebound. The Referee's roll to determine the share trend is made with
a DM+2, so there is a real chance this will happen. If so, the Travellers
could make some money on the market. If not... well, there are never
any guarantees.

Stock trends and stability will be affected by local political conditions as
well as wider economic factors. This usually follows a logical pattern;

```
wars increase the value of companies making military hardware whilst
periods of political instability tend to make the markets more volatile in
both directions. The Referee may also impose conditions based on the
Travellers' actions or the needs of the campaign. Smart Travellers might
begin generating their own adventures as they find ways to undermine the
stock of their rivals and push the value of their own preferred companies
up. Alternatively, they might attempt to obtain insider information about
the plans of a company that will affect its share price or the intended
actions of a political group or government that might affect the markets.
```

```
It is important that the stock market remains a spur to adventure rather
than a means for Travellers to generate vast wealth from the comfort of
their armchairs. If, for some reason, the Travellers do become obsessed
with playing the markets the Referee will have to develop a much more
complex model than this one to accommodate them... or perhaps entice
them to go out adventuring instead of watching their stock portfolio grow.
It might seem unfair to wipe out the Travellers' finances with an arbitrary
market crash but the Travellers may have enemies who do not want to
see them prosper. Having large amounts of money tied up in a volatile
stock market might create an opportunity for an enemy to strike the
Travellers right where it hurts... in the wallet.

##### THE AEL YAEL

The Ael Yael are among the few exceptions to the time-honored rule
of sophontology stating that flying creatures, because of body weight,
brain size and the metabolic requirements for both, will never evolve into
intelligent species. The combination of low gravity and dense atmosphere
on Jaeyelya (B-584655-6), the homeworld of the Ael, permits flight in
creatures large enough to develop the brain capacity for sentience.

Adult Ael stand at one and a half meter tall and mass 50kg. The species
evolved from flying arboreal hexapods, which used powerful hind
and mid-legs to grasp their prey as they swooped from overhead. A
carnivore's cunning, coupled with environmental pressures, favored the
rise of intelligence. The forelimbs' gliding surfaces eventually became
serviceable wings (which span four meters), while the midlimbs became
both generalised and flexible enough to permit tool-making.

Ael eyesight is slightly better than that of a human. Their visual range
extends into the infrared, giving them good night vision, while a light-sensitive lens pigmentation keeps them from being dazzled by harsh
sunlight or brilliantly reflective surfaces.

Ael are fierce warriors in combat; in hand-to-hand combat they can
use their tail as a club or buffet a target with their wings. Their hindleg
talons are also fearsome weapons. Ael are not comfortable fighting in an
enclosed area where they cannot take flight, such as within a starship or
building interior, and will avoid this if at all possible.

HISTORY



The Ael apparently developed intelligence too late to save their species.
Their world of Jaeyelya is drying out and the once extensive forests have
been vanishing during the last 1,000 years. Some few Ael colonies still
live in treetop communes but most inhabit the caves and fractured clifftop
rocks that overlook Hi-yayahu lae – the Glittering Floor. There are probably
less than a million Ael on the entire planet and, but for offworld contact,
they might have already been driven into extinction by climate change.

With the coming of the Imperium to Jaeyelya, there was new hope for the
survival of this fascinating culture. Large numbers of Aeyeyehi (literally
'updraft riders', referring to young Aels just learning to fly) travel off-planet
each year to attend Imperial schools and training programs. A number
have joined the Scout Service, which finds their racial talents useful in
the exploration of new worlds. The wealth and knowledge returned to
Jaeyelya this way may save this culture from extinction.

```
The Hi-yayahu lae clifftop commune is the guardian of Jaeyelya's primary
natural resource; the Glittering Floor is a dry sea bed and vast mineral
and metal deposits collected here as the sea evaporated millennia
ago. Jaeyelya was first discovered by an Imperial mining corporation,
which began tunnelling into the Glittering Floor's salt beds looking for
manganese and copper. Large numbers of local Aels were effectively
enslaved by the corporation; the proud and freedom-loving autochthones
fought back and the bitter war resulted in Imperial intervention and
establishment of an Imperial protectorate on the planet. 'The Government
Place' is a building at the planet's Class B starport facility, which serves
as the Aels' link with starfaring civilizations.
```

```
The Aels themselves seem never to have evolved a governmental
system, at least none more complex than loose tribal or family structures,
```

Jaeyelya

Vipach subsector

```

and welcome the offworlders' representation. Naturally, they have an
acute distrust for mercantile corporations and for individuals employed
by such concerns. As a result, ores and minerals mined from the dry sea
bed are purchased directly from the government and the planetary mines
are a government monopoly.

SOCIETY



The Ael Yael culture has a rich heritage of recited verse, poetry and
mnemonic literature. They enjoy reading the writings of Imperial peoples,
which they like to rework into Aelan literature types in their free time.
They are solitary, shun close contact with other races and always seem
somewhat homesick for the craggy cliffs and rock spires above the
Glittering Floor. Allusions, metaphors and similes are often expressed in
terms of hunting or flight, such as 'I grasp your meaning,' 'I need to look
down on that idea' or 'My soul feels wing-clipped'.

EQUIPMENT



The Ael Yael never developed sophisticated tools or weapons. They now
have a few projectile weapons based on Imperial designs but have never
been comfortable with mechanisms that kill at a distance. Ael can handle
human weapons but suffer DM-2 when handling or firing a weapon not
designed for their hands. When attacking, they prefer to leap several
meters into the air and hover (when gravity and atmosphere permit
flight), firing wildly all the while. They have difficulty firing from cover,
both psychologically and anatomically.

Ael Yael require breathing apparatus to live on worlds with thin atmospheres
and flight is impossible for them in such environments. Vacc suits have
been designed for Aels but they can wear these only by folding their wings.

50

```
AEL YAEL TRAVELLERS


Travelling Ael feel they have a responsibility to the entire Ael Yael race.
Except for a small living allowance, everything they earn is turned over
to a planetary trust fund administered by the protectorate government on
Jaeyelya. When an Ael signs up for a job, it will be with the good of the
race in mind and how they might be benefited.
```

```
Another quirk is a deep-seated distrust (sometimes hatred) of
corporations and businesses throughout the Imperium, especially
```

```
51
```

those involved in mining or planetary exploitation. Experienced Aels (with SOC 9+) will understand that not all big business interests involve
murder and genocide but will never trust mercantile organizations or
individuals unreservedly. They will join an enterprise sponsored by
merchants or corporations only if they see very large rewards for their
planet in accepting such a job.

If an Ael becomes aware of a situation where a culture is being exploited
or victimised, they will without hesitation side with the wronged party and
will work (secretly or openly) on their behalf.

These tendencies are strong enough that if faced with direct conflict (if,
for instance, helping exploit a primitive people will greatly benefit their
own world financially) an Ael Yael may suffer nervous collapse.

Characteristics
Ael Yael Travellers have the following modifiers applied to their
characteristics: STR-1.

SOC is treated differently for Ael Yael; it represents the Ael's experience
off-planet. A low SOC indicates the Ael is inexperienced in the ways of
interstellar culture and may make social gaffes or elementary mistakes.

Traits
Ael Yael Travellers all possess the following traits.

Dense Atmosphere Flyer: Aels can fly on worlds of Size 6- less with
dense atmospheres. In standard atmospheres, or on worlds of Sizes 7-8, they can glide from high elevations to lower ones, hover for a few
seconds or ride updrafts found alongside cliffs or within canyons.

Keen Awareness: Ael Yael receive DM+2 on Recon checks, due to the
Ael's keen eyesight and habitual awareness of their surroundings.

Careers
Jaeyelya has a small militia army but no planetary navy or marine
service. An Ael who wishes a military background must join the Imperial
services. DM-1 applies to all enlistment attempts due to the cultural
differences encountered.

Ael Yael cannot join any mercantile organization, due to their attitude
towards business concerns. They cannot enter the Noble career.

Ael Yael receive DM+2 when attempting to join the Scouts.

When Ael musters out of a career, 90% of all cash benefits are
immediately given to their homeworld's Planetary Development Fund.
Only the remaining 10% is retained by the Traveller.

##### THE ARHIYAO CLAN

```
The Arhiyao are a minor Aslan clan, presented here to illustrate the
political and territorial dynamics of a typical clan. They have holdings in
Ranib subsector within the Trojan Reach. The Arhiyao can be used as a
'home clan' for Aslan Travellers or as patrons or foes.
```

```
HISTORY


The Arhiyao are a young clan by Aslan standards. They cannot trace
their lineage back to Kusyu; they have never been accounted among
the Twenty-Nine Great Clans, nor were their glorious deeds recorded in
the Grand Conclave. Their history begins during the Aslan Border Wars.
```

```
The Deeds of Klraiyo
The earliest account of an Arhiyao landholder is in 1733 (-563 Imperial),
when a warrior named Arhiyaoaiftlaiyhruuhru is recorded as having
seized the western islands of a world in the Reaver's Deep in a series of
lightning raids. He captured a human warship and used it as his flagship in
the Border Wars, launching surprise attacks on human-occupied worlds.
According to the folk-tales of the clan, Arhiyaoaiftlaiyhruuhru possessed
supernatural powers and was capable of teleporting and reading the
minds of his enemies. He could 'step between the shadows' and bore the
title 'Laughing Lightning-Ghost'. Descendants of Arhiyaoaiftlaiyhruuhru
served honorably in the armies of several lords and vassals of the
Hrasua but the sons of Arhiyaoaiftlaiyhruuhru never held enough territory
to be accounted an independent clan.
```

```
In 2577 (209 Imperial), one of these descendants, Klraiyoarhiyaoaiftla-iyhruuhru, quarrelled with his Hrasua lord over a point of honor. Klraiyo
and his followers hired a colony ship belonging to the Wahtoi clan and
crossed the Great Rift. Klraiyo was accompanied by his new wife, a stolen
female of the Hrasua line. The Hrasua have never forgotten nor forgiven
this slight – for a vassal to kidnap a Hrasua bride is an insult that will burn
longer than the stars. Further, Klraiyo lacked the money to pay for the colony
vessel, so he and his followers had to indenture themselves to fight on
behalf of the Wahtoi as soon as they arrived in the Trojan Reach. Although
Klraiyo is recognized as the true founder of the Arhiyao clan, he is also a
cautionary example. If Arhiyaoaiftlaiyhruuhru teaches his descendants to
seize what they desire with cunning and ferocity, then Klraiyo shows they
must consider what they desire carefully and not overreach.
```

```
The years immediately after crossing the Great Rift were hard ones for
the young clan. The Wahtoi used Klraiyo and his followers as scouts
and then as cannon fodder in their wars with Aroaye'i rivals. Of the
4,000 males who followed Klraiyo into the Trojan Reach, no more than
```

```
53
```

800 survived the 50 years of indentured servitude. They had acquitted
themselves heroically against the Aroaye'i in battle but all their victories
were on behalf of the Wahtoi. Klraiyo was among those who died in
battle under a Wahtoi banner but his twin sons Jaklraiyo and Hruklraiyo
took up their father's cause and his dreams of a free clan. From him,
they learned to dream and plot; from their Hrasua mother, they learned
how to fight.

As soon as the 50 years of forced service were at an end, Hruklraiyo
immediately declared war on the Wahtoi.

The Wahtoi, never a strong military clan, had come to depend on Klraiyo's
followers as shock troops. Their own house armies were no match for
Hruklraiyo's warriors and the Wahtoi were forced to cede the world of
Uitasoayaw (0810/Ranib) to Hruklraiyo. With this much territory at his

54

```
command, Hruklraiyo was able to declare his followers an independent
clan, the Arhiyao. Hruklraiyo became the first Arhiyaoko. Back in Hierate
space, such a declaration would have been considered little more than
a joke. The clan had less than 600 adult males, no money, no industrial
base and no ships apart from a few battered and poorly-maintained
scouts. They had a world but the two most influential clans in the region
```

- the Wahtoi and the Aroaye'i – considered the Arhiyao to be enemies
and one of the Twenty-Nine still held a blood feud with the new clan
over the kidnapping of Klraiyo's bride. Back in Hierate space, the Arhiyao
would have been put back in their place within a decade by some long-established traditionalist clan.

```
The Trojan Reach is a land of opportunity and new possibilities, although
```

- even the possibility that such a weak clan could thrive. The Arhiyao
had one advantage that their enemies had not considered and it was this
advantage that would save them.

```
In the Imperium, the Scout Service is a notoriously dangerous
occupation. Exploring the fringes of settled space, dealing with
hostile environments or bizarre cultures, encountering alien races and
inexplicable phenomena – it is a rare scout who survives for too long
in the service. Such a rare scout almost always leaves the service
a rich man, although, as a successful scout will know about mineral
deposits and valuable alien plants or animals, rich worlds and alien
relics, and potential short cuts and trade routes. The Arhiyao had been
used as scouts by the Wahtoi for 50 years and had not shared all of
their discoveries with their erstwhile masters.
```

```
The Arhiyaoko's twin brother, Jaklraiyo, became the clan envoy to the
Aslan corporations who were eager to exploit the newly-discovered
worlds in the Trojan Reach. Instead of repeating his father's mistake
and tying the fortunes of the clan to a single master, Jaklraiyo (and his
mates Kaaus and Ihkauiai, who are the unsung heroines of the Arhiyao's
survival) played the corporations off against each other. Trading the
location of a lanthanum deposit to one company got the Arhiyao more
ships and weapons to fend off attackers; the secret of harvesting valuable
biochemicals from a dangerous jungle planet got them the herdstocks
and farming equipment they needed to survive.
```

```
55
```

Klraiyo died in battle under another clan's flag, having led his kin into
near-slavery. One of his sons died in the great palace on Uitasoayaw,
old, fat and surrounded by young wives and grandsons, surveying the
vast territory under his claw. The other son vanished in a misjump aboard
his custom vessel, the 1,000-ton Salouwealryekha but was accounted
one of the wealthiest Aslan in the Reach before his disappearance.

THE WAHTOI STRIKE BACK



Over the next two centuries, the Arhiyao consolidated what they had won.
Their population grew as they tamed Uitasoayaw and they maintained
their reputation as excellent warriors, although advancing technology put
their troops at a disadvantage against more powerful clans. Their trove
of valuable secrets ran out as Aslan expansion in the Trojan Reach went
past the borders they had scouted but the clan continued to send scout
ships out into unexplored space and worked with the trade corporations
in exploiting new worlds.

After a generation's work, Uitasoayaw was a usable agricultural world.
They seeded the planet with Kusyuan bacteria and built huge automated
factories to subtly adjust the atmosphere. Livestock purchased from
the corporations were set loose and within a decade of colonization the
Arhiyaoko was able to hunt aua'ka through the young forests. The planet
was unremarkable in terms of resources, however, and the Arhiyao were
rapidly falling behind the technological development of other clans. This
technological gap would prove devastating to the clan's fortunes.

In the Hierate, the Great Clans invariably possess the most advanced
technology, as they have the resources to pour money into research.
New developments are then passed on to their vassal clans in exchange
for service. The Arhiyao were independent for centuries and both their
previous suzerains were hostile to them. While the rest of the Hierate
pushed towards TL13, the Arhiyao were slipping back towards TL9.

In 2660 (282 Imperial), Uitasoayaw was attacked by Wahtoi forces. The
Wahtoi were accompanied by mercenaries and ihatei bands. As soon as
the Wahtoi fleet jumped in, their envoy informed the Arhiyaoko that the
two clans were now at war – a limited war for control of Uitasoayaw's
fertile western continent and spaceport.

The Wahtoi had significant advantages both on the battlefield and in the
initial challenge – as they already had ships in the system, they could
force the earleatrais to accept that space forces would be part of the
conflict. The Arhiyao had few warships and nothing that could defeat
the considerably more advanced Wahtoi ships. On the ground, the
Arhiyao warriors were better trained and had more stomach for battle
than their foes but were using yeheal autorifles against wye'oiheasarl
plasma cannons.

56

```
The war lasted six weeks. The Wahtoi and their allies suffered more
losses than they anticipated but the earleatrais declared them the victors
nonetheless. Over a third of the territory on the Arhiyao homeworld was
seized by the invaders. The shame led the current Arhiyaoko to commit
ritual suicide, passing the leadership of the clan to the next generation.
```

```
Over the next decade, the clan rebuilt its military forces and sought out
allies. One of these alliances would lead to the reclamation of Uitasoayaw
and the rise of the Arhiyao; the other would nearly destroy them.
```

```
The first of these new allies was the Tru'shan, another offshoot of the
once mighty Trui'kt. The Tru'shan faction hived off from the larger clan
during the Cultural Purge; they were a clan of scientists and researchers
who advocated the use of robots in battle instead of risking Aslan lives.
The fundamentalist khiraokhaor'ya clans wiped out the Tru'shan drone
armies in a series of apocalyptic battles, forcing the Tru'shan to flee
Hierate space. The Tru'shan established a new colony on Ewyeyal in
the Silraaihe subsector but were isolated from the rest of the Aslan.
Most of the clans in that region were on the khiraokhaor'ya during the
civil war, while the Tru'shan were tainted by their tsekho roots. The
Tru'shan were pariahs but they were pariahs with advanced technology
and a formidable industrial base.
```

```
The Arhiyao offered to act as intermediaries, reselling Tru'shan
technology to khiraokhaor'ya clans. A new corporation, the Ekhoaoiarl (Brother-Making Commercial Endeavor) was founded to pursue this
trade. The Arhiyao owned a third of the shares, the Tru'shan another
third and the final third was traded openly on the Aslan markets (but most
of these shares were quickly purchased by Arhiyao traders).
```

```
The income from the company allowed the clan to pursue even greater
fortunes. The nearby world of Hkakh, a marginally habitable frozen
world, was colonized and established as a trade nexus. Hkakh freeport,
with its state-of-the-art spaceport, its automated cargo handling and
its regular security patrols made it attractive to the growing number
of traders passing through the Ranib subsector on their way to the
Imperium. The company expanded quickly; from its foundation of trading
solely in Tru'shan technology, it diversified into dust-spice, terraforming
technology, agricultural products and cosmetics.
```

```
The second alliance was with the Glorious Empire. Like the Tru'shan, the
Aslan of the Glorious Empire were unable to trade freely with the Hierate.
The Arhiyao offered them a back door into the Hierate market, in exchange
for military support and a sizeable share of the profits. It was not smuggling
per se but certainly skirted the boundaries of both legality and honor.
```

```
An alliance with the Glorious Empire was extremely controversial within
the clan but the Arhiyaoko's word was law. The Arhiyaoko of the period
was a young warrior named Khtoarlyu, the Steel Cat, who lost an eye and
```

```

```

both legs during the battles for Uitasoayaw. He was fitted with Tru'shan-built cybernetics to restore his strength and for the rest of his life he was
accompanied everywhere by Tru'shan technician-maidens to maintain
and adjust his machine parts.

The second war for Uitasoayaw saw a combination of Arhiyao and
Glorious Empire troops descend on the Wahtoi territories like fiery tigers.
The Wahtoi crumbled and fled into space; the new Tru'shan-built Arhiyao
fleets pursued them and the war ended with the Wahtoi ceding the world
of Ehaealir to the Arhiyao.

THE GLORIOUS EMPIRE



The clan's alliance with the Glorious Empire was always going to be a
troublesome one. Ever since the Tokouea'we clan broke away from the
Aslan Hierate, conflicts and territorial wars were virtually constant along
the border. The Ahriyao approached the Glorious Empire during a time of
comparative peace but soon the wars started up again.

The Ahriyao were under no legal obligation to send warriors to fight
on either side but they were dragged into the conflict anyway. The
Ekhoaoiarl company freighters needed escorts if they were to continue
trading with the Empire. Often, these escorts were attacked by Hierate
forces from the Wahtoi or a Hrasua-related clan, as old enemies of the
Ahriyao took the opportunity to inflict some damage on the clan. Other
attacks were from previously neutral clans who objected to any trade
with the Glorious Empire.

The clan was bitterly divided between those who believed that the
alliance with the Glorious Empire was a mistake and those who argued
that the clan must hold true to its word, no matter what the cost. The
Tru'shan and the executive board of the Ekhoaoiarl both added their
voices to those arguing against the alliance but the aging Khtoarlyu,
still ko of the clan, refused to contemplate any diminishment of the
clan's ties to the Empire, even when it became clear that the alliance
had ceased to be a benefit and was now an invitation to war to any clan
with a grudge against the Empire.

In 3066 (604 Imperial), Khtoarlyu was murdered by an assassin. The two
strongest candidates for ko were Sauhkesi, the commander of the clan's
space fleet and Yahefiy, the wealthiest and most powerful male on Hkakh.

Sauhkesi was young to be considered for ko but his prowess in space
combat had won him great honor. He was a strong advocate of the
alliance and considered the Glorious Empire to be the model that future
Aslan clans in the Trojan Reach should follow. The weak human worlds
of the sector begged to be conquered and the clan who reached out and
put them under the claw would be invincible! He was an honored friend
of the Glorious Empire and even hunted with the Glorious Emperor in the
palace gardens on Syoakh.

58

```
Yahefiy was a great landowner, who counted most of Hkakh as his
personal fiefdom. Three of his wives were on the board of the Ekhoaoiarl,
while his sons were powerful generals and captains in the clan's armed
forces. Yahefiy was seen by most as Khtoarlyu's inevitable successor, a
safe pair of claws to guide the clan into a brighter future.
```

```
The two fought a bloody duel on Uitasoayaw and the elder Yahefiy was the
victor. Rather than accept his new lord, Sauhkesi accused him of being
behind the assassination of Khtoarlyu. Yahefiy countered by claiming
that a secret war of assassins had been declared months earlier by the
Hrakoea, blood-kin of the Hrasua and so therefore another traditional
enemy of the Ahriyao. The Hrakoea were also among the clans attacking
the Glorious Empire.
```

```
Sauhkesi returned to his ship and jumped away. Yahefiy's first act as ko
was to break the alliance with the Glorious Empire and add the forces of
the Ahriyao to the war.
```

```
Surprisingly, Sauhkesi agreed to lead the invasion force, striking at his
former friends with all the fury of an Aslan warrior.
```

```
Within months, the clan had their first victory over their erstwhile 'allies'.
The world of Souftea in Nora'a subsector was ceded to the Arhiyao by
the Glorious Empire after a shockingly brief war. The Glorious Empire
commander at Souftea surrendered directly to Sauhkesi, who took
possession of the world. The human slave population of Souftea, numbering
some three million, were abandoned to their new Arhiyao overlord.
```

```
The conflict with the Glorious Empire rumbled on for another four decades
but as the advancing borders of the Hierate pushed the war zone out of
easy reach of Ahriyao forces, the clan's involvement in the war diminished.
An uneasy peace lasted for the remainder of Yahefiy's reign.
```

```
RECENT TROUBLES


While the Ahriyao claim four worlds as theirs, only the well-established
planets of Uitasoayaw and Hkakh are the clan's core territory. Ehaealir is
shared with several other clans, most of whom have more resources than
that Ahriyao. Souftea is wholly owned by the clan – or, more accurately,
the pride of Sauhkesi, who treat the world as their private fiefdom and
have only limited contact with the rest of the clan.
```

```
In 3618 (1089 Imperial), some 20 years ago, three warships from the
clan's space forces vanished near the Glorious Empire. These three
vessels – two Aositaoh-class cruisers and one Halaheike-class pocket
warship – were all under the command of officers from Souftea. An
investigation into the disappearance revealed no signs of sabotage or
hostile forces operating nearby. Either all three vessels simultaneously
misjumped or they defected to the Glorious Empire.
```

```
59
```

The Tru'shan clan is undergoing its own internal difficulties. A blight on
their homeworld of Ewyeyal has destroyed much of their food production
capability, forcing them to trade for basic foodstuffs via the Ekhoaoiarl.
Unless a cure for the blight is found, the Tru'shan economy may collapse
or they may be conquered by another clan who can feed their citizens.

60

```
CLAN STRUCTURE


The clan Ahriyao numbers some 29 million Aslan, divided between seven
major prides who make up the aristocratic tier of the clan (and hold most
of the territory) and another four dozen lesser prides. The head of the
Ahriyao pride is the Ahriyaoko – the dominance of the Ahriyao pride has
gone virtually unchallenged throughout the clan's history, with only a few
exceptions such as the Yahefiy dynasty that ruled for three generations.
```

```
The seven major prides are as follows.
```

```
Ahriyao Pride
The oldest of the prides, the families of the Ahriyao can trace their lineage
back to Arhiyaoaiftlaiyhruuhru himself. They hold the territory in the east
of Uitasoayaw. The Ahriyao are traditionally the leaders of the clan and
even when they are out of power, they wield considerable influence over
the clan's politics. Most of the clan's priests, envoys and poets come
from this pride and the current Ahriyaoko is from this bloodline.
```

```
Homeworld: Uitasoayaw
Strengths: Territory, Tradition, Politics
```

```
Yahefiy Pride
Originally a family within the Fiyatrusha, the Yahefiy broke off from the
older pride when Yahefiy became the Ahriyaoko and moved his family
and holdings to the world of Uitasoayaw. The Yahefiy are the Young
Turks of the clan and are the most ambitious and aggressive of the
families. They are feuding with the Sauhkesi and are closely allied with
the Arhiyao through intermarriage. They have eclipsed their former kin,
the Fiyatrusha and today the two prides have little in common.
```

```
While the head of the pride dwells on Uitasoayaw, the family still has
extensive holdings on Hkakh.
```

```
Homeworld: Uitasaoyaw
Strengths: Wealth, Territory, Military
```

```
Sauhkesi Pride
The Sauhkesi rose to prominence within a single generation. Their
founder, Sauhkesi, was born to a landless awkhea family. He managed
to win a place in the space service, where his genius for military tactics
and lust for conquest won him great honor. When the ahriyaoko died,
Sauhkesi was able to mount a serious claim for the clanship. When
Sauhkesi was defeated by Yahefiy, he returned to space and followed
the clan leader's command to make war on the Glorious Empire. He
conquered the world of Souftea from the Glorious Empire and claimed
it as his own. The pride of Sauhkesi has held that world ever since. The
```

```
61
```

ruling family of the Sauhkesi are of Sauhkesi's own bloodline; the other
families are the descendants of his loyal crew.

The Sauhkesi are mistrusted by most of the other families. They are seen
as isolated and strange and have little contact with the rest of the clan.
Their culture is closer to that of the Glorious Empire than the Hierate. In
effect, the Sauhkesi are a clan within a clan and some fear that it is only
a matter of time before the Sauhkesi leave the clan – or are driven out.
The thought of a Sauhkesi claiming the clanship is a dreadful one to the
Ahriyao and Yahefiy prides.

Homeworld: Sauftea
Strengths: Territory, Military, Slave Labour

Jaklraiyo Pride
This pride claim descent from one of the explorers who started the clan's
tradition of scouting. The Jaklraiyo are explorers still but they also have
considerable interests in the clan's trade and diplomatic circles. The
Jaklraiyo have only minimal territories, which means they will never be
contenders for the political leadership of the clan but they are immensely
wealthy. The Jaklraiyo traditionally support the Ahriyaoko in most matters
but have played kingmaker in the past, throwing their wealth and power
behind a challenger from the Yahefiy or Haurenahar.

The Jaklraiyo are peacemakers and pragmatists; they have argued
against expanding the clan's holdings, arguing that the clan lacks the
military resources to hold another world.

Homeworld: Uitasoayaw
Strengths: Space Fleet, Wealth, Trade

Haurenahar Pride
The Haurenahar are another branch of the Ahriyao. The pride was founded
when the clan conquered Ehaealir. They are somewhat isolated from the
rest of the clan and see themselves as above the petty squabbles of the
Ahriyao, Yahefiy and Sauhkesi. The Haurenahar have a strong military
tradition and agitate for the clan to improve its space fleet and expand
once more.

Homeworld: Eheaalir
Strengths: Territory, Military, Trade

Fiyatrusha Pride
The Fiyatrusha Pride was born of a political marriage between elements of
the Ahriyao and the Tru'shan clan and they have inherited the technological
aptitude of their Tru'shan forebears. The Fiyatrusha produce the most
skilled technicians and scientists of the clan and are the backbone of the

62

```
clan's spacefleet. The Fiyatrusha's htahyu (clan stronghold) is in orbit of
Hkakh; it is a huge habitat, more than 600 years old and supporting more
than 10,000 Aslan. It is the clan's primary shipyard.
```

```
The pride has always harboured ambitions of greater influence (and the
Tru'shan clan would very much like to see their kin rise to command
the Ahriyao clan) but lacks both the territory and the warrior spirit to win
such power.
```

```
Homeworld: Hkakh
Strengths: Technology, Trade
```

```
Ahriusha Pride
This pride is almost as old as the clan but has never been close to
power. The Ahriusha families are the descendants of the warriors who
accompanied Klraiyo across the Great Rift. They are the backbone of the
clan's military and have a considerable amount of territory on all four of
the clan's worlds but the pride is too divided to mount a serious challenge
for the leadership. The rest of the clan keeps playing Ahriusha families
against each other; there are Ahriusha who are sworn to support the
Ahriyao and the Fiyatrusha and the Yahefiy and even the Sauhkesi.
```

```
Homeworld: Uitasoayaw
Strengths: Territory, Military, Population
```

```
POLITICS


Internal politics within the Ahriyao is cut-throat in a restrained way. In
other clans, the fight to determine which pride will dominate the clan
is a brutal, bloody one and any of a half-dozen strong prides could
rise to rule over the rest. The Ahriyao are a small clan and (a few rare
examples notwithstanding) the Ahriyao family of Ahriyao Pride rules
over the Ahriyao clan. The major political struggle, then, is between the
Yahefiy warriors and the Jaklraiyo merchants for control of the clan's
direction. When the clan goes to war, the Yahefiy grow in power; when it
is peaceful, the Jaklraiyo benefit.
```

```
The other prides have their own limited interests and switch their support
between the two major prides as circumstances dictate. The Sauhkesi
are always on the fringes of clan politics – no pride likes them but they
are powerful enough to be cultivated as allies.
```

```
MILITARY FORCES


The clan is too small to support any capital ships, so the Ahriyao
specialise in smaller, more agile forces. They have significant numbers
of Ekawsiykua escorts for light duties and local defence, augmented by
monitor ships. The clan possesses two dozen Aositaoh cruisers and 10
Halaheike warships. Their ground forces number some 30,000 warriors.
```

```
63
```

WORLDS



Uitasoayaw (B579687-9, Ni) is the oldest of the clan's planets. It is a
poor and unremarkable world. Its native biosphere was wiped out by the
Aslan terraforming efforts, although aborigine flora still persists in isolated
regions. To most visitors, Uitasoayaw has nothing to recommend it except
for breathable air and the capital city of Yairtyrl but to the Ahriyao, this is
the promised world that their ancestors fought for.

Hkakh (A424546-E, Ni) is a frozen ice ball but beneath the ice are rich
reserves of iron and other metals. Orbital factories produce the majority
of the clan's industrial goods and starships. Hkakh is situated on a major
trade route and is the seat of the Ekhoaoiarl Corporation, which has been
the economic engine that drives the clan. However, a controlling interest in
the company's stock has recently been acquired by the Tokolfeahr clan in
a hostile takeover bid. The intrusive presence of the Tokolfeahr has begun
to cause tensions that threaten to boil over into a full-blown clan war with
the Arhiyao. Hkakh is a hellish place to live – the major cities are all under
domes of packed ice and most homes are in old mining tunnels. The
Aslan of Hkakh are miserable, denied the wide open spaces and hunting
grounds their blood calls out for.

Ehaealir (B63657B-9, Ni) is right on the border of the Glorious Empire
and is regularly attacked by slaver ships. The clan's holdings there
are in the Mountains of Glass. There is a sizeable human population
on Ehaealir; tribes of wild humans live in the foothills, driven back to a
primitive level of development to survive the slavers.

Souftea (A551754-D, Po) is a small, nearly airless moon but was heavily
industrialised by the Glorious Empire. The factories of Souftea are as
productive as those of Hkakh (possibly more so, although there are

rumors that the Sauhkesi use slave labour in the underground mills).
The Sauhkesi want clan funding to expand the old shipyards in orbit of
the moon, upgrading them to allow the construction of warships. So far,
this proposal has been blocked in the clan council by the Yahefiy but the
Haurenahar believe it is the best way to secure the coreward frontier.
```

```
IMPORTANT CHARACTERS


The Ahriyaoko today is an elderly male of the Ahriyao family. His mind is
fraying and he is rumored to be increasingly paranoid about the clan's
ancient foes, the Hrasua. His youngest wife, G'aulai of the Yahefiy has
taken over more and more of her husband's duties.
```

```
The most influential voice on the board of Ekhoaoiarl is another female,
Iwala. She believes that the clan has grown stale and needs to invest in
explorers and free traders to bring in new opportunities. The unexplored
and untamed sections of the Trojan Reach hold the future of the clan
and she is looking for ambitious young cubs to sponsor. Unusually for
a female in her position, she has not yet taken a siyajkhoara oath to
remain unmarried.
```

```
The commander of the clan's space fleet is Yesyakhei of the Ahriyao but
many in the navy believe that young captain Tolirah – the victor at Uao,
the warrior who slew the pirate queen Khitlaa – is the true leader of the
clan's military forces. Tolirah is an inspiring leader and a brilliant tactician
```

- but he is Sauhkesi, so the clan's elders mistrust him.

```
ADVENTURE IDEAS


The Tru'shan Famine: The Tru'shan clan are on the brink of famine. An
Arhiyao researcher just discovered that a new form of plant engineered
by Syoisuis scientists will thrive on the Tru'shan worlds. If this plant
can be obtained, then the famine can be averted. The Travellers must
acquire these seeds, by fair means or foul, before the Tru'shan starve or
some other clan uses the seeds to drive a wedge between the Ahriyao
and their allies.
```

```
Civil War on Ehaealir: The border world of Ehaealir breaks down into
civil war. The Ahriyao clan's holdings on that world are secure and easy
to defend, so the war poses little threat to them. Militant leaders in the
clan suggest that this is the time to go on the offensive, to take territory
from other clans – but what if the Glorious Empire takes this opportunity
to attack?
```

```
New Frontier: The Ekhoaoiarl want to begin trading directly with the
Florian League and to do that they need to establish a waystation
somewhere in Yggdrasil or Dpres subsector. The Travellers are given a
scout ship and sent to find a good colony world.

##### PRIDE OF THE LION

```
Location: Thor (D669577-5) Yggdrasil Subsector, Trojan Reach
```

```
THOR


Thor is a distinctly unimportant world located on an offshoot of the
Dustbelt, or Sindalian Main. Most traffic along the main uses the primary
route into Florian space, bypassing Thor and nearby worlds. As a result,
Thor is very much a backwater, with a few hundred thousand inhabitants
divided up among various micro-states.
```

```
The world has a breathable atmosphere but little useable land. Most
of what does exist forms the grandly named Continent of Grizel; the
remainder is scattered about the globe as small island chains. Grizel is
home to most of the world's population and its low-quality starport. Few
offworlders visit Grizel; almost none have set foot elsewhere in the world.
```

```
The primary industry on Thor is ranching, with meat and animal products
making up the majority of the world's exports. Various beasts are herded
but the most common is the Kundbock, a large grazing animal found on
several worlds in the Reach. Kundbock ranches are scattered all over
Grizel, each one essentially a tiny kingdom ruled by its owner.
```

```
There are a few towns and one decent-sized city on the continent of
Grizel but it is the ranchers who hold real power as they control the
economy and employ the largest proportion of the population. The towns
exist mainly to provide technological functions and support industries
for the surrounding ranches and their administrative councils are kept
in their place by the ranch bosses. As a result, governance is highly
fragmented – which suits the ranchers' agenda and is unlikely to change.
```

```
In recent years, groups of Aslan ihatei have set-up communities on the
continent of Grizel. For the most part they have caused little trouble;
they behave a lot like the ranchers and there is plenty of land to spare.
Conflict, when it has occurred, has been localised and is as likely to
result from friction between rather arrogant leaders (of both groups) than
competition for resources.
```

```
THE SITUATION


The Travellers are expecting to leave Thor sometime soon when they
are approached by Martin Trelane. Trelane is apparently a bit drunk and
rambles awkwardly for a while about a problem he has. Clearly he needs

does, it becomes clear he is hurt. In fact Trelane has a pistol bullet in
his side. The wound is covered by a bandage but has not been properly
treated and will begin to leak blood through his shirt.

Trelane eventually explains that he became friendly with an ihatei leader
named Ewyryhu, assisting him in peacefully obtaining more land by
purchase and trade in return for assistance to some of the local ranchers
who were struggling. He became well-respected and was considered a
member of Ewyryhu's ihatei band – a rare honor for a non-Aslan.

Recently, one of Ewyryhu's sons sent a message to his father that one
of the Grizel ranches was available for sale but the rancher insisted
upon dealing with Ewyryhu directly. The situation seemed to be above
board but in fact was a trap. An old enemy of Ewyryhu, a human named
Charles Marchand, has lured the ihatei leader to the ranch and plans to
kill his entire family.

Trelane wants help to rescue his friend. He is aware that there are those
who despise ihatei and would disapprove of anyone helping them but
Ewyryhu is an honorable man who deserves better. As for Marchand, it
is true that Ewyryhu once clawed his eye out but he had it coming.

EWYRYHU AND MARCHAND



When Ewyryhu was a young mercenary working on the Imperial frontiers,
he encountered a naval flight officer named Charles Marchand, a
wealthy and arrogant young human who particularly disliked two groups

- mercenaries and non-humans. Ewyryhu tolerated him as best he could
but eventually reacted angrily to a racial insult. Ewyryhu struck Marchand
across the face with claws fully extended, laying flesh open to the bone
and destroying Marchand's right eye.

No action was taken against the Aslan, since all the witnesses agreed
Marchand provoked the incident and attempting to punish Ewyryhu
could have wider implications given how difficult relations were with
the Aslan Hierate at that time. Marchand's career as a fighter pilot was
curtailed by his injury. He marked time in a navy desk job until, to his
great surprise, he became sole heir to a ranch on Thor that had been
owned by a distant relative.

Marchand had spent many hours plotting revenge against Ewyryhu but
never expected to have the chance to strike back. Then, out of the blue,
he found himself owning property next door to his enemy. Learning that
Ewyryhu was buying up nearby land, Marchand made it known that the
new owner of his ranch did not intend to settle on Thor and wanted a
quick sale.

68

```
Ewyryhu's son had never heard of Charles Marchand and was taken in
by what appeared to be a genuine offer. His advisors told him the price
was about right; the land was good and its herds healthy. He went with a
small party of assistants to view the property and was impressed enough
to suggest his father take a look in person. Ewyryhu and his entourage
were ambushed with tranq gas and stunners, and taken prisoner.
```

```
Marchand's plan is simple. They will be released in the wilds of Grizel
without weapons or supplies, and given one hour to do whatever they
please. After that, he will hunt them and kill them all. He knows no action
will be taken so long as the Aslan are on his land; they will be considered
intruders and thus subject to the ranch owner's justice. If Ewyryhu and
his entourage can get off Marchand's land they may or may not be safe
but Trelane knows they have no chance of crossing a 100 kilometers of
wilderness on foot before Marchand hunts them down.
```

```
For his part, Trelane was with his friend and captured alongside him;
Marchand's twisted sense of honor prompted him to give Trelane a
chance to walk away and save himself. Instead, he jumped one of the
guards, taking a bullet in the process and dragged a young female Aslan
named Kiri into a nearby air/raft. They managed to escape and he is now
seeking any help he can get. Ewyryhu will be grateful for any assistance
the Travellers can offer but Trelane cannot promise any particular reward.
He intends to go back and try to rescue his friends whether or not the
Travellers agree to help him.
```

```
KIRI AND TRELANE


Kiri is a juvenile female Aslan – about as non-combatant as someone can
be. She is hiding nearby, armed with a half-empty revolver Trelane took
from a guard. She, the air/raft, and this gun are all Trelane has to work
with. What Trelane has not told the Travellers is that Kiri is Ewyryhu's
daughter and, although young, she knows her duty as a member of his
household. She would only fight in desperate self-defence but if given a
technical or organizational task to perform she will carry it out with a zeal
rarely seen in human juveniles.
```

```
Martin Trelane's mental state may be important as events unfold. When
he fled, he was reacting as a human; the Aslan instinct would have
been to stay and die with his pride leader. He worries that Ewyryhu will
consider him to have deserted and he may be correct in this. He veers
between a desperate conviction that he must save his friend and despair
he may have already disgraced himself and nothing he does will have
any meaning.
```

```
Trelane is not bleeding seriously but his wound will eventually incapacitate
or kill him unless properly treated. He will resist offers to treat the injury,
saying there is no time. Pointing out that he may die will not sway him;
he does not care at this point. The only argument he will listen to is that
his collapse at an inconvenient moment might wreck the entire rescue

even this must be couched in terms that make sense to Trelane at this
time – failing in the rescue is no more a disgrace than running away in
the first place and he does not dare hope for redemption in the eyes of
Ewyryhu. He can be convinced by suggestions that he can still help his
friend whatever the outcome for Trelane himself might be.
```

```
THE HUNT


Marchand is holding Ewyryhu along with his wife/estates manager
Lrowyie and their son Ktiskryhu. The latter was pretty thoroughly worked
over by Marchand. There were also two guards, one injured and the other
dead. All survivors can use weapons if they become available, although
they will be unlikely to think of fashioning makeshift spears or bows.
```

```
Marchand plans to release his captives at dawn, then give them an hour
before commencing his hunt. His ranch is about 450 kilometers from the
starport, taking the form of a rough circle 400 kilometers across with the
house at its center, mostly open grassland with some woods and a small
lake. Herds of kundbock wander freely and there is a lot of other wildlife
to confuse thermal sensors. Herdsmen live in small cottages here and
there on the estate and might be out and about – Marchand has not
troubled himself to warn them of what is about to happen.
```

```
The ranch house is of stone construction. It was not built with security or
defence in mind but would still be a formidable obstacle. In the garage
are several vehicles including wheeled trucks, three air/rafts and a grav
car with nose mounted laser rifle that the Marchand guards call 'Charlie's
toy starfighter' when the boss cannot hear (see the g/runner city car on
page 127 of the Vehicle Handbook).
```

```
Marchand's hunting party will consist of himself and 11 others, armed
with rifles and pistols, in the three air/rafts, well-stocked with food and
cold beer. Marchand has offered cash prizes for 'good kills'. He wants
Ewyryhu for himself, of course, and intends to kill the pride leader last
at close range. The hunting party will not hesitate to kill anyone who
interferes and is unlikely to face any sort of legal action if they shoot
intruders on the estate – Aslan or human.
```

```
THE RESCUE


If the Travellers can reach the house before dawn they may be able
to somehow get the captives out. They are bound and will be carefully
guarded. A little before dawn they will be loaded into a wheeled truck
and driven a few kilometers up the road. Marchand follows in his grav
car and watches the release before rushing back to the house to savor
the occasion with his followers. After a little more than an hour the
hunting party sets out. They will try a variety of methods to kill the
Aslan, including dismounting to snipe at them with rifles or firing from
air/rafts making a low pass.

```

72

```
Marchand wants to frighten and demoralise the Aslan before killing them
and intends to pick off Ewyryhu's family before finally confronting him.
This will not be a fair exchange of course; ideally he wants the Aslan
wounded and weak before gunning him down with a pistol. He is adamant
that he wants to watch Ewyryhu die and for him to know who took his life.
```

```
This will create some opportunities for the Travellers. They may be able
to tackle some of the hunters whilst they are setting-up an ambush,
hoping their fellows will drive the Aslan onto their guns. The Travellers
might even be able to extract the Aslan before the hunters find them,
leaving Marchand wandering around in the wilderness.
```

```
However, there are complications. The 'hunt', totally unfair as it is, has
become a matter of personal honor between Ewyryhu and Marchand.
Ewyryhu may insist on chasing the hunters down and killing them all
rather than retreating to get reinforcements. He may even resent Trelane
for bringing reinforcements, as if this casts doubt on his ability to protect
his people. His wife Lrowyie is more pragmatic but is most definitely a
subordinate and can only challenge her husband so far.
```

```
The Travellers may have to confront Marchand and/or fight his men.
They are quite willing to take part in the hunt – like many others living on
the Sindalian Main they have no love for ihatei – but they are not devoted
to Marchand. They will save themselves rather than taking grave risks
to protect him and abandon the hunt if he is killed. If so, the workers will
retreat to the ranch house and call for help from other ranchers nearby.
That could create a new set of problems for the Travellers.
```

```
If the rescue succeeds, the Travellers will be rewarded. This may be
grudging and condescending, or Ewyryhu may declare them friends of
his ihatei band for life, depending on circumstances. Likewise, his attitude
to Trelane could be anything from hostility to lauding him as a hero. Aslan
have many tales of heroes who fought to the last alongside their clan lord
for honor but there are also stories of wounded warriors who crawled
away to seek help they could not provide themselves. If Ewyryhu knows
Trelane was wounded when he fled and still managed to save Kiri, this
will make his opinion vastly more positive.
```

```
It is possible that the Aslan will want to hunt down the would-be hunters
and if they feel positive towards the Travellers an invitation will be
extended. It would be an affront to Ewyryhu to turn this down but agreeing
means essentially plotting ambush and murder.

SMAETAL SWARMS


Smaetal swarmers, popularly known as smaets, minnies and pirhana
bugs, are an extremely small, flying life form native to Smaeta, near the
Imperial core but now found infrequently on countless humid, tropical
environments on worlds across the Imperium. They are commonly
spread by tramp freighters and merchant vessels carrying consignments
of tropical fruit and control of these and similar pests is a major concern
of port and customs officials everywhere.

Each adult smaet weighs less than .1 gram and has a wingspan of less
than one centimeter. They are generally encountered as an upright,
pillar-shaped cloud, about two meters high, which drifts just above the
ground. One cloud may contain over 50,000 individuals.

Smaets have a rather complicated reproductive cycle. The eggs, which
are laid by the thousands on unripe fruit, seem to mature and develop as
the fruit ripens, drawing on the fruit's internal chemistry in some fashion.
Various methods of preserving or delaying the ripening of the fruit seem
only to delay the maturation of the eggs. The actual incubation period
is uncertain and highly variable. When the eggs hatch, the tiny, winged
reproductive phase of the creature burrows out and joins the local, rapidly
growing swarm.

Smaets are carnivores. The cloud will approach any homeothermic life
form of more than 50 kilograms mass at the speed of a human running.
A single bite is no more than an annoying pinprick but thousands of bites
in the space of a few moments can be deadly and smaets are classified
as dangerous life forms.

After several feedings over a lifetime of a few weeks, the smaet cloud
begins to break up as individual creatures die. For some reason yet
unknown, some 70-90 individuals in each cloud survive the swarm's
death. They attach themselves to the exposed roots of certain fruit trees,
shed their wings and begin burrowing into the roots. After an uncertain
period of time, the smaet enters a metamorphic pupal stage, buried
within the tree's root.

After as long as 10 years, the organism emerges as a clumsy, winged
creature that proceeds to lay hundreds of eggs on the soft portions of
the tree; leaves, flowers, ripening fruit and so forth. This egg-laying form

74

```
does not eat and lives only long enough to lay its eggs. If the eggs are
laid on a soft-skinned fruit, the smaet will be able to deposit eggs just
under the skin, where they will be practically undetectable.
```

```
It is believed that the swarming phase of the smaet life cycle is when
genetic material is exchanged. Smaets appear to be hermaphrodite but
the nature of gene exchange is not clearly established. Understandably,
there has been some difficulty observing this life form closely enough to
ascertain details of reproduction.
```

```
The primary means by which these creatures spread from world-to-world
is in uninspected or improperly inspected cargoes of fruit, usually soft-skinned tropical varieties, such as sasthmandra, corybellum, banana,
```

```
75
```

opaldew and kung fruit. Except for those planets where smaetal swarms
have established themselves within the local ecology, they are most
often encountered in starship holds or starport storage areas, where
shipments of fruit from infested worlds have ripened and released
their unsuspected riders. Fortunately, such encounters are rare. Stern
quarantine laws exist against fruit from worlds known to harbour this
pest; shipments are carefully inspected and stiff penalties laid upon
smugglers. A brisk illegal business con tinues on several planets where
opaldew and aureorb have been outlawed.

Attacks by a smaetal swarm cause 2D damage per round against every
Traveller within the same area as the swarm. They can be avoided
by jumping into water or running through fire or thick smoke. Torches
confuse them, although they will still attack a Traveller carrying a torch or
burning brand and they will inflict only 1D damage per round. Each turn,
the Traveller may make a DEX check to see if the torch breaks up the
swarm long enough for them to escape.

Smaets can pursue a human as fast as they can run and for as longas
they can keep going. Travellers partially protected by armor will
suffer only 1D damage each round. Travellers in sealed suits will be
completely immune to smaetal attacks and take no damage. Note,
however, that Travellers have been known to suffer accidents due to
vision impairment when a swarm attacked, due to their faceplate being
covered by the creatures. In addition, if any opening or hole exists in
the armor, the swarm will eventually find it, and the protection provided
becomes partial rather than full.

Weapons such as lasers or slug throwers are useless against smaetal
swarms, because of their numbers. Unfortunately, those weapons
best able to disperse a swarm (grenades, wide beam plasma guns,
flamethrowers and the like) are inappropriate for use within the confines
of a starship hold or starship terminal. Vacuum, jets of water or blasts
from CO2 fire extinguishers have been known to control them in close
quarters. The eggs have thus far proven immune to all common ovicidal
techniques, including fumigation and irradiation.

As smaetal swarms have spread from world-to-world, genetic drift has
created wildly divergent species. Common variations include increased
size of the swarming members (wingspans of up to 8 centimeters have
been seen on Tahauri) and poisonous or hyperallergenic stings (on
Drenghai, Moloaku and others). Extreme caution must be exercised
whenever swarming smaets are encountered.

SPRINGER (Arachnofefis var.)
```

```
Springers (also called cave spiders, spider-cats and shrew-spiders)
are eight-limbed quasi-mammalian carnivores. Their origin world is
not known but they are found throughout the coreward regions of the
Imperium. Although spread widely by the mysterious Ancients, the range
of the springer was increased considerably by the colonists of the First
Imperium, as a means of biological pest control. Massing between 250
and 500 grams, springers average 15 centimeters in length.
```

```
For reasons not completely understood, springers evolved from a four-limbed form. Each limb evolved into two, the upper portion shortening
almost into non-existence. Silk is excreted by glands in the upper chest
area, which is hairless to prevent tangling. Two modified 'thumbs' are used
to draw silk from the glands and manipulate a web. The silk produced is
adhesive only when excreted, drying rapidly to a thick rope. Webs woven
of it are coarse networks that signal the presence and location of prey.
The powerful hind legs are adapted to leaping and the remaining limbs
are used for clinging to prey while venom (from two glands in the mouth)
is injected into the prey.
```

```
Springers are hermaphroditic. Young are born live at any season, in
litters of three to five. Since most of their 'milk' glands have evolved into
silk-producing glands, the springers supplement their youngs' diet with
regurgitated, partially digested food.
```

```
Springers normally inhabit caves, dense forests and rock crevices but can
often be found inhabiting piles of rubble and deserted buildings. Springers
are not normally dangerous to humans but the bite can be painful and their
venom can cause death due to allergic reaction in some individuals.

KIAN (Pseudostrophio gigas)
```

```
Kians are herbivore grazers of large size, originally known from Prilissa
in the Trin's Veil subsector of the Marches. Due to their hardy nature,
they were exported to a number of worlds as beasts of burden and are
a common sight in the coreward reaches, both in the wild and captivity.
They are plains dwellers, travelling in herds of 10-60 individuals, feeding
upon grasses, leaves or similar plant matter.
```

```
Externally, the kian is a large bipedal creature with a long neck, short tail
and no other limbs (the remains of an atrophied pair of fore-limbs can be
found in some sub-species). Kians are thickly furred, their coats showing
distinctive colour patterns of brown, gold, lemon-yellow and black. A kian's
legs are powerfully muscled for fast movement over long distances. The
sturdiness of their overall frame has made them a frequent choice for use
as mounts and pack animals on the planets where they are found. Kian's
hearing and eyesight are extremely good, reflecting their predator-laden
environment of origin.
```

```
Internally, the kian is unremarkable. It has a closed circulatory system
and an overall high metabolism which requires that it be fed 30-50
kilograms of vegetable matter daily. The kian digestive system consists
of two stomachs, which allow the animal to break down the toughest
plant matter into digestible form. The kian has a thick layer of fat that
insulates in cooler climates and provides a degree of protection from the
venomous bites or stings of small animals. The skeleton is strong and
heavy, and is structurally not unlike that of the moa and other prehistoric
terrestrial flightless birds of Terra.
```

```
When attacked or frightened, kians will usually flee but if cornered are
capable of delivering deadly kicks with either of their hooved feet. The
large claws projecting from the backs of the feet are only present in the
male and seem to be used solely for ritual combat between males prior
to mating.
```

```
Kians can carry up to 250 kilograms comfortably and will refuse to move
if overloaded. Kians cannot tolerate thin atmospheres and require a
special filter/muzzle (Cr60) for tainted atmospheres.

HOPLITE (Marmotophagus var.)
```

```
The hoplite is a large, heavily armored creature found on many
worlds throughout the territory once ruled by the Vilani empire. The
world of origin of these beasts is not known with certainty, since early
Vilani colonizations and subsequent settlement efforts have resulted in
hundreds of worlds with mixed bio chemistries. Because of the carapace
and its horns, the hoplite is believed to have originated on a world with
many large predators and this and other factors have limited the number
of possible worlds to less than a dozen, mostly in the Vland sector.
```

```
Adult hoplites weigh about 1,600 kilograms and are usually around 2.5
meters long and one meter at a shoulder. They are bilaterally symmetrical,
homeothermic hexapods, with a closed circulatory system incorporating
a three-chambered heart.
```

```
The most notable feature is the thick, articulated carapace (with many
projecting horns) covering the dorsal surface of the animal's body.
```

```
Hoplites are solitary animals, usually feeding on small, burrowing
animals. They locate the burrows by smell and probe within them using
an extensible, tough proboscis. When the prey is located, the proboscis
grabs it, extracts it from the burrow and conveys it to the mouth, located
on the underside of the head. When not in use, the proboscis is pulled
back under the head, forming a j-shaped structure.
```

```
Paired structures on either side of the proboscis are extremely sensitive
feelers used by the hoplite to detect the vibrations of an approaching
predator or the faint sounds made by a burrowing animal. The forward
facing horns are sometimes used to enlarge a burrow to make the
insertion of the proboscis and extraction of prey easier.
```

```
When attacked, the hoplite will attempt to run but, if cornered, will turn on
its attacker and begin to gyrate its body, slashing with its horns. It takes a
tough, determined predator to bring down an adult hoplite.

IVORY GAZELLE (Rasura weberii, R. kudebeckii, et al)
```

```
The ivory gazelle has an unknown planet of origin. Adult gazelles weigh
between 60 and 80 kilograms, depending upon exact subspecies. Aside
from their leg arrangement, they are externally very similar to many
[[Terra|Terran]] ungulates, which has led some authorities to speculate that they
might be the result of genetic tinkering from basic [[Terra|Terran]] stock. Certain
details of their internal arrangements, however, casts doubt upon this
theory, as they resemble no known [[Terra|Terran]] form.
```

```
The skeleton is made of a white substance similar to ivory in appearance
and consistency, which (in both sexes) protrudes from the skin of the
skull to form paired horns. There are three pairs of legs, attached to
a dorsally located spinal column. Respiratory and circulatory systems
follow [[Terra|Terran]] norms.
```

```
The chief departure from [[Terra|Terran]] characteristics is in the digestive
system. Although possessing many of the characteristics of mammals,
the ivory gazelle has a digestive system with many features of that of
birds. The mouth has no teeth but has two pairs of opposed shear-like structures (one on each side of the mouth) and a long, prehensile
tongue. The grasses and soft shrubs upon which the ivory gazelle
feeds are cropped off and swallowed whole, as with [[Terra|Terran]] ruminants,
but instead of being regurgitated and chewed at a later time, the food
is passed through a series of giz zards, where it is ground up by stones
swallowed for the purpose.
```

```
Ivory gazelles congregate in herds of seven or more individuals, including
one top male-female pair, (usually the parents of the rest of the adult
members of the herd) and several family groups of two to five individuals
each. When threatened, ivory gazelles either flee or, when cornered,
form a circle, surrounding their young, and fight to the death.
```

```
There are two sexes, male and female, which mate for a season or
more, and raise between one and three young per year. The young are
born early in the year and are capable of standing within a few minutes,
running at full speed in an hour or two.
```

```
Ivory gazelles are often hunted extensively and their meat is a major
source of protein and fat. The hides provide fur that is spun and woven
into cloth, while the hides are tanned and converted to leather. The 'ivory'
of the bones is prized over all other parts of the animal. It is light, strong
and can be readily carved to many shapes.
```

```
83
```

They are usually found in upland valleys, where there is sufficient
vegetation to support them and rough ground to provide cover from
predators. The six limbs give an advantage on rough slopes as they are
able to use four legs for footing and two for defence.

Ivory gazelles are usually a dark grey colour on the back and sides,
fading to a lighter shade on the underside.

GARHAWK (Stellafalconformis ululatis)
```

```
Also known as the skyhuntress, or kahkahyeek from its hunting call,
the garhawk has become popular in some circles of Imperial nobility for
hunting. Properly trained garhawks, with their keen eyesight and superb
hunting instincts, can spot and kill prey over remarkably long distances.
```

```
Garhawks are large (over one meter wingspan) flying carnivores, originally
from Nagaschk, a planet to spinward of the Imperial core. Natives of the
world, a TL3 race, delighted in hunting; their use of garhawks in sport
sparked interest among human visitors. Once the trick of raising and
training these vicious aveforms was mastered, a small but lucrative trade
in garhawks gradually opened, introducing them through much of the
Imperium, the Solomani Sphere and even within the Zhodani Consulate.
Humans, at least those enjoying the hunt, have found the sport of hunting
with garhawks a fascinating renaissance of falconry and hawking.
```

```
The stellafalconformes are prime examples of convergent evolution.
Externally, they are quite similar to the exoaccipitiformes of Kalga, the
falconiformes of Terra and countless other aveform families throughout
Charted Space, where natural selection has acted to mold highly
efficient flying hunters. Garhawks are not true birds; they bear live young
in nest litters of two or three. The young are fed meat in the nest by the
two parents for three months. After their first flight, the young will remain
in the nest for six to nine months. Garhawks form mate-pairs that last
for life; they are often sold in pairs, for this increases the lifespan (and
the value) of the animal but they rarely breed in captivity and those that
do are inferior hunters. The average lifespan is 10 years, although one
specimen lived for 19 years after it was taken.
```

```
Garhawks should always be approached cautiously. Sudden noises
or movements, unfamiliar voices or odours, brightly coloured or shiny
objects or articles of clothing have been known to provoke sudden and
unrelenting attacks. Trained garhawks are used to hunt a wide variety
of small animals, usually not exceeding half the garhawk's weight.
However, they have been known to ferociously attack creatures far
larger than themselves in defence of their young, or on command from
an experienced handler.

It is not a sport for the poor (which also explains its popularity in certain
circles). Garhawks are expensive to buy – a trained one demands
a price of close to Cr5000 – and expensive to maintain. A full-grown
garhawk, weighing as much as six kilograms, needs 500 grams of fresh
meat per day. Temperamental creatures, a garhawk can be particularly

86

```
vicious when not properly fed and cared for. Other expenses include
heavy gloves, pads and training paraphernalia for the handler, hoods
and collars for the garhawk. A full-time handler is required to feed and
care for the creatures and to constantly sharpen their training. Garhawk
falconry remains a sport of the very rich.
```

```
Travellers may encounter garhawks in a variety of circumstances.
For example, a wealthy patron or enemy may keep them for sport;
one encounter might find a nobleman unleashing his garhawk against
unwanted intruders to his estate.
```

```
Skyhuntresses are occasionally found aboard ships as cargo, especially
if the destination is a world where hunting is popular or where there
are many landed estates. Travellers owning a starship may be hired to
deliver a mated-pair of garhawks to a noble... and woe betide them if the
feeding instructions for their charges are not carried out precisely.
```

```
Garhawks inhabit such remote and hard-to-get-to places that they are
rarely encountered by Travellers in the wild. If a party is actively searching
for garhawks, make a Formidable (14+) Recon check for each week spent
searching the proper locations (generally high, not readily accessible
mountaintops, cliff faces and so on) for them to successfully locate a nest.
```

```
Training a garhawk requires much time, patience and blood. One raised
in captivity usually lacks the spirit of its wild cousins, so a garhawk must
be captured while still flightless in the nest in order for optimum training.
Those captured too soon will not survive and those captured too late
will be too hard to control (although even the best trained of garhawks
are difficult to control completely). Training takes D3+5 months, with a
training session every day. On each encounter, an Average (8+) Animals (training) check is required to avoid attack. At the end of the training
period, a Difficult (10+) Animals (training) check is required for the
garhawk to be trained and 'domesticated'.

##### LSP MODULAR CUTTER

The now-familiar modular cutter has its origins in the Third Frontier War (979-986). It was not the first modular vessel, and is by no means the
only one, but for most Travellers it is the archetypical craft that leaps to
mind when detachable modules are mentioned.

During the course of the Third Frontier War, Imperial armed forces
generated requirements for several vessels that would fulfil a variety
of logistics and specialist roles. Various bids were put forward but the
winner was a design from Ling-Standard Products that could fulfil all
the intended roles by swapping out an internal component. The LSP
Modular Cutter was not ready for service during the Third Frontier War
but large numbers were deployed in the Solomani Rim War (990-1002)
where it proved highly useful. This vessel and its derivatives have since
become so common that the term 'cutter' is often taken to specifically
refer to a 50-ton small craft.

Overall, the modular cutter with a module in place is a 50-ton streamlined
craft with the overall hull form of a cylinder and rounded nose. The cutter
itself is a 20-ton vessel consisting of an engineering section aft and control
area forward, joined by a dorsal rail. The 30-ton detachable module fits
between these sections. Some variants of the modular cutter concept
clip the module to the dorsal rail. This has the disadvantage of rendering
the parent craft unstreamlined when the module is detached, so most
modern cutters use an enclosed module bay accessed by clamshell
doors. Side-opening doors are popular in some areas but a 'gull-wing'
configuration with the doors hinged along the dorsal rail is considered to
give the greatest structural integrity and makes picking up a module from
the ground a simple matter of landing atop it.

Modules on an open rail-type cutter must be fully enclosed to provide
life support. On the 'door cutter' design, modules may have their own
bulkheads or not, depending on their intended role. In both cases the
module can be supplied with power and water by way of the dorsal rail,
although it may have its own self-contained life support system.

The cutter is capable of 4g acceleration with a module aboard, which is
more than enough for most applications, although its very basic sensor fit
is a limitation in some circumstances. Military cutters often operate under
the control of a command vessel or parent ship, typically with fighter escort,
and are tied into the detection and tracking net of the force as a whole.
Private operators do not have this luxury and may choose to upgrade the
sensor package unless the craft is engaged in safe, routine work.

88

```
Without the module in place the cutter is capable of greater than 4g
acceleration but this is inadvisable as the module provides much of the
vessel's structural integrity; without it, distortion of the spine can occur. This
renders the cutter unusable for module operations and difficult to control. In
extreme cases, a cutter might break its own back simply by accelerating.
```

```
The cost for a new cutter from LSP or one of the licensed builders
is MCr10.287 without a module aboard but surplus vessels are often
available at prices as low as MCr2.5. Unlicensed versions are also
produced, some of which are better and some far worse than LSP
standard. Price does not always dictate quality in this case.
```

```
Most civilian cutters use one of three standard modules, often with
local modifications. Note that these modules have revised costs and
construction from those detailed on page 103 of High Guard.
```

```

```

### Open Module

An 'open' module is not open to vacuum but is instead open in the sense
of being customisable. It consists of 30 tons of open space, with tie-downs for cargo and little else. Open modules are used for cargo haulage
or converted into part-passenger/part-freight craft with the addition of a
fresher and a few seats.

### Fuel Module

```
A fuel module is dedicated to fuel tanks, supported by a fuel processor.
The standard cutter is a streamlined design with fuel scoops built in,
enabling it to skim fuel and refine it in transit back to the parent vessel
or installation. Fuel cutters are carried aboard many long-range vessels,
enabling them to use an unstreamlined configuration and still refuel
without visiting a starport.

### ATV Module

The so-called ATV module is more correctly named a 'vehicular interface
transport' module but it is normally associated with ATVs carried by
exploration ships. The standard module has space for up to 12 tons
of vehicles and can easily accommodate a standard ATV or multiple
smaller vehicles. Vehicles are secured in a configurable cradle that can
accommodate most standard designs.

The remainder of the module's space is normally used for mission-related
spares, stores and supplies. A set of collapsible lockers and containers
is provided for this purpose. If additional vehicle or working space is
desired, each ton of stowage can be collapsed into a tenth of its size or
be completely removed and left behind.

### Starport Shuttle Module

```
The shuttle module is a standard design used by many starports,
providing surface-to-orbit transportation for two dozen passengers and
a small amount of cargo. The cabin space, in theory, allows a steward
to operate the vessel's tiny galley and passengers to visit the equally
cramped fresher, although in many cases a couple of extra seats are
packed in or the space is converted to cargo capacity.

### Field Workshop Module

A field workshop module can be used to support vehicles or other
equipment in any application from prospecting to mercenary work. It
is configured to allow vehicles to drive in and out, and the work cradle
can also be used to secure a vehicle for transportation. However, the
workshop module is not just a dedicated vehicular repair facility – it can
carry out this work in addition to a range of other tasks.

### Assault Boat

```
The assault boat module was one of the first to be created but is normally
used only by military and mercenary operators. It is capable of carrying
up to 32 infantry personnel with bulky equipment such as vacc suits and
combat armor, and deploying them rapidly through a set of hatches in
the floor and sides of the module.

### Mining Module

The mining module is designed to convert a standard cutter into a
prospecting craft with mining capability. It has very little cargo capacity and
is generally used to locate and process ore samples, with transportation
carried out by another craft.

### Shelter Module

```
The shelter module is designed to be deposited on the surface of an
otherwise inhospitable moon, asteroid or planet. It provides (cramped)
accommodation for up to eight personnel for an extended period. Indeed,
if water or ice is available for fuel, the shelter module has an endurance
limited only by food supplies and how long the crew can stand being
cooped up together. Its functions are controlled from a tiny workstation
that is always referred to as 'the bridge' despite being nothing more than
a seat with a console on a moveable arm.

## TRAVELLINGTRAVELLING

##### JUMP POINT TO PORT

The majority of starships spend their time plying from one starport to
another in a different system. This involves an endless cycle of hauling to
the jump point, a week in jumpspace and a short transit to the destination.
Passengers aboard such a vessel may perceive no difference during
these three phases; they board the ship, amuse themselves until it is
time to disembark and pay little attention to what is going on outside. The
ship's crew, on the other hand, may have a very different perspective of
time spent travelling to and from the jump point.

Orbital space around a world with a Class A or B starport tends to
be busy and subject to a strict set of traffic control guidelines. Often
a busy port will post guidelines at neighboring starports, indicating
favored emergence points for ships from that system. If pre-prepared
jump solutions are available, these use standard emergence zones. A
policy of giving priority to vessels emerging from jump at these points
encourages traffic to behave in a manner that is easier for the starport
authority to manage.

Traffic much beyond the 100-diameter jump limit tends to be sparse
unless there is another important world or major installation in the system.
In-system traffic often makes sublight transits or jumps between distant
outposts or industrial facilities, and may not even be noticed by the
average vessel using the main starport. In any case the crews of these
vessels are usually too busy making sure they comply with instructions
and avoiding the occasional erratic maneuver by other vessels.

Some crews insist on hot-dogging through traffic, making course
corrections on the fly and trusting to their epic piloting skills. They may
be able to boast they have never had a collision but that does not mean
they never caused one. Most port authorities frown on reckless flying,
imposing escalating fines or bouncing the vessel to the bottom of the
docking priority list until they settle down and make a cautious approach
like everyone else.

VOLUME OF PORT TRAFFIC



The number of ships using the mainworld's port at any given time is
largely determined by the population and importance of the mainworld.
The following system is used to determine the number of vessels in the
region of the port, including ships landed at the highport and downport,
vessels in transit in and out to the jump point and those headed to or
from other destinations in the system close enough to the mainworld to
be significant.

98

```
Note that this system does not indicate small craft serving the port itself
or military and defensive vessels. It is an indication of the level of civilian
traffic around the port, which in the case of an important high population
world tends to be quite a lot.
```

```
The number of vessels in the region of the port is determined by the
system's Shipping Activity Indicator (SAI), which is based on the
Population score of system and starport type.
```

```
SAI is determined by rolling a number of dice equal to the Population, with
the following modifiers for the world's political and economic significance:
```

- If the world is of little importance and difficult to get to (for example,
    a mid-tech world well off the main trade lanes) reduce dice by -3 to
    a minimum of 1D.
- If the world is of little importance or difficult to get to (for example, a
    productive world well off the main trade lanes), reduce dice by -1 to
    a minimum of 1D.
- If the world is economically important (usually this means it has an
    Industrial trade code or it might be a major trade nexus), add +2 dice.
- If the world is politically important (such as a subsector capital) add
    +2 dice.
- If the world is of great political importance (such as a sector capital),
    add +4 dice.

```
Particularly significant worlds might increase the number of dice even
further. The capital of a major state such as the Third Imperium will have
huge numbers of ships around its ports unless there are restrictions or
special permits required to visit.
```

```
The quality of the starport further modifies the SAI.
```

```
Class A: Multiply SAI by x3
Class B: Multiply SAI by x2
Class C: SAI is as normal
Class D: Reduce SAI by -2 dice to a minimum of 1D and roll 1D-1 instead
of 1D
Class E: Reduce SAI by -4 dice to a minimum of 1D and roll 1D-2 instead
of 1D
```

```
Results of less than zero indicate the port is empty.
```

```
So, a Population 8 Industrial world (adding +2 dice) with a Class A
starport will roll 10D to determine SAI and multiply this by 3, for a possible
range of values 30-180, averaging around 105. Meanwhile, a Population
6 backwater world (reducing SAI by -2 dice) with a Class D port will roll
2D-2 for a possible range of 0-8 ships, averaging around 3.
```

```
99
```

**Type of Traffic**
The SAI gives the raw number of starships in and around a port, which
may be all the Referee needs. If additional detail is desirable, the nature
of traffic can be determined.

Ships are defined by five general classes, based on their tonnage.

Bulk: Bulk commercial vessels begin at 50,000 tons displacement and
have no upper size limit.
Large: Large commercial vessels are in the 10,000-49,999 tons
displacement range.
Medium: Medium commercial vessels are in the 5,000-9,999 tons
displacement range.
Small: Small commercial vessels range from 1,000-4,999 tons displacement.
Minor: Minor traffic falls in the sub-1,000 tons displacement range.

The proportion of vessels within a system falling into a given tonnage
class is dependent upon starport type – large freighters do not call at
Class E starports! If a breakdown is desired, use the Ship Size table.

Ship Size

```
Port Class Bulk Large Medium Small Minor
A 5% 10% 20% 30% All other vessels (35%)
B 0% 5% 10% 20% All other vessels (65%)
C 0% 0% 5% 10% All other vessels (85%)
D 0% 0% 5% 10% All other vessels (85%)
E 0% 0% 0% 5% All other vessels (95%)
```

These percentages represent a proportion of the SAI that falls into a
given tonnage class and should be used as a guideline by the Referee
rather than representing an exact figure. A Class C port at a Population
6 world might have 6-36 ships in port at any given time. Using these
guidelines it is likely that there will be 0-1 Medium ships (quite likely
none) in or around the port and around 0-3 small commercial vessels. All
other vessels will be in the sub-1,000-ton displacement class.

This is only a guideline of course. Larger vessels may use minor ports
from time-to-time. The arrival of a superfreighter at a backwater port
will cause quite a stir, not least due to the difficulty of accommodating
its needs.

Time in Port
To determine how long any particular ship will remain in the docking/
landing bay, roll 1D-1 for the number of days before departure. A
result of zero indicates the ship is due to depart today. If a 6 is rolled,

100

```
roll 2D+6 instead. There will usually be a reason why a vessel spends
so long in port; perhaps there are crewing difficulties or the ship is
undergoing maintenance.
```

```
TRAFFIC CONTROL ISSUES


Orbital traffic control is a complex business. Even with automated
assistance, keeping large numbers of vessels moving in and out of the
starport in an orderly fashion is a challenge. A delicate balance must
be struck between optimizing turnaround times for economic reasons
and keeping ships safe from collision. Priority is given to larger ships for
both of these reasons – large vessels require more time to answer the
helm than little free traders and bring in a lot more money. Thus traffic
control patterns are usually built around getting the largest vessels
into a docking bay efficiently and safely. A smaller ship can be sent
around another orbit or two, or placed on a complex approach requiring
multiple course changes. This frustrates many small-ship skippers but
it is the way of things.
```

```
Priority for approach and docking clearance follows a hierarchy based
on ship size, affiliation and compliance with standard protocols. Some
organizations such as shipping lines, or well-connected individuals,
can jump the queue and diplomatic vessels almost always do. A small
starship may have to wait hours – perhaps even days in some cases – to
be given docking clearance.
```

```
To determine the delay in being granted clearance, roll 2D with the
following modifiers.
```

```
Minor vessel: -4
Small Vessel: +0
Medium Vessel: +2
Large Vessel: +4
Bulk Vessel: +6
'Respectable' vessel (for example, one operated by a formally
recognized shipping line):
```

```
+3
```

```
Official vessel (for example, a courier operated by a friendly
port's authority):
```

```
+6
```

```
Diplomatic or well-connected vessel (for example, a private
yacht owned by a friend of the subsector duke):
```

```
+5
```

```
Important diplomatic vessel (for example, the sector duke's
own yacht)
```

```
+10
```

```
If the Travellers want to bargain or persuade the port authority of their
importance, they may make an Average (8+) Advocate, Diplomat or
```

```
101
```

Persuade check and apply twice the Effect to the final outcome. They
may end up being bumped back in the queue if they fail the check.

The outcome of this check is known as the ship's Docking Priority or
DP. DP is deducted from 20 to give the number of Increments the ship
has to wait. The length of an Increment depends on the port type –
small ports with little traffic often grant immediate clearance as there
is nothing in the way; larger ports with complex traffic patterns may
have a bay available but be unable to thread the ship through holding
patterns for a while.

If DP is zero (or less), immediate approach clearance is granted. If, not,
the ship has to wait a number of time increments depending upon the
class of port.

Increments

```
Port Class Increment
A 2Dx5 minutes
B 2Dx3 minutes
C 4D minutes
D 2D minutes
E 1D minutes
```

102

```
For example, a bulk freighter belonging to a large shipping line arrives
at a Class A starport. Its DP is determined by rolling 2D (getting a result
of 4 in this case), adding +6 as a bulk freighter and an additional +3 for
being part of a recognized shipping line. The final result is 13, which
is deducted from 20 to give 7 Increments. The Referee determines
the day's Increment on 2Dx5, getting a result of 25 minutes. The bulk
freighter has to wait in a holding pattern for (25 x 7) 175 minutes – nearly
three hours – before being given clearance to approach.
```

```
Meanwhile, the subsector duke's cousin arrives in his 800-ton yacht.
This is a minor vessel (-4 on the roll) but the owner is well-connected for
a +5 modifier. Some haughty words to traffic control result in an Effect of
+2 on the owner's Diplomat check, giving a further +4. The duke's cousin
rolls an 11 with a net modifier of +5, for a DP of 16. Deducted from 20
this gives four increments of 25 minutes, so the yacht is headed in after
a delay of 100 minutes, well before the bulk freighter whose captain has
a few things to say about wealth and privilege.
```

```
Once clearance is given, ships are expected to proceed in to dock in an
orderly and safe manner. Pilots have a small amount of leeway to make
their own judgements but traffic control does not like those who cut corners
or get too close to other ships. A crew that wants to hot-dog rather than
plod patiently risks being bounced to the back of the priority queue.
```

```
To avoid this, the crew of the incoming ship must make a Routine (6+)
Advocate, Diplomat or Persuade check. The Effect of this check is added
to the pilot's skill level. If the total equals or exceeds the world's Law
Level, there is no penalty. If it is lower, the ship is refused approach
clearance. Its slot will be bounced back a number of Increments equal
to the Effect the check was failed by. Essentially this means that a ship
that threads effortlessly through the traffic with no hint that anything could
go wrong, coupled with words on the radio that sound professional or
suggest the port authority would be well advised to accept the situation,
will be able to dash in and dock quickly. One that lurches about all over
the place and scares other port users will be sent around to try again or
outright refused permission to dock.
```

```
Finally, the vessel will be able to enter port and dock. To passengers in
their cabins, it may seem as if nothing has happened but for the crew the
transit from jump point to port may have been the toughest part of the
journey – especially if some bunch of yahoos in a free trader thought they
knew better than the port's traffic controllers. People like that should not
be allowed on the spacelanes...

##### WAR IN THE FOURTH DIMENSION

The availability of air power adds a third dimension to the battlefield
and the use of the electromagnetic spectrum expands it into a four-dimensional battlespace. The electromagnetic spectrum is routinely
neglected by militias and insurgents, but a properly equipped military
force is capable of making war in this 'fourth dimension'.

The term 'radiation' is often associated with dangerous nuclear radiation
but electromagnetic radiation can be anything from radio or radar
signals through thermal emissions to the electromagnetic fields around
equipment and wiring. Detecting and analysing these signals is a critical
part of advanced warfare. Whilst large-scale electronic and cyber warfare
requires bulky equipment and absorbs significant resources there is
much that a small unit can do to gain an advantage over its opponents.

A variety of low-cost electronic equipment is available on the mercenary
and security market, which can make all the difference when taking on a
much larger lower-tech force.

COMMUNICATIONS



There is an old adage that 'warriors buy better guns; soldiers upgrade
their comms'. Whilst not 100% accurate, good communications can
be a massive force-multiplier and the ability to interfere with enemy
communications can dislocate their plans and cripple their operations.

At a mid-tech level most communication is by voice transmission.
Scramblers and channel-hopping radios give a reasonable degree of
security against interception by similar equipment but are no match for
more advanced communications-intelligence equipment.

At higher Tech Levels, warfare can become more 'network-centric', with
information shared between all units in the same network, including
direct camera feeds and sensor data from many platforms. Indeed, there
is so much data on offer that even with automated assistance a soldier
runs the risk of being saturated and unable to process what is useful.

To remedy this problem, most battlefield information network systems
have a tiering feature that is set by the electronics experts at
headquarters. Command units, which usually contain communications-warfare experts, receive all information from all platforms but only pass
on what the system deems relevant to lower-tier units. This function

104

```
can be overridden by a headquarters unit, feeding additional data to a
force that needs it. More basic squad-level information networking kits
are also available and are popular with mercenary formations. It is not
uncommon to see a merc unit equipped with TL7 assault rifles and a
TL10 information network system.
```

RECONNAISSANCE



```
AND INTELLIGENCE


The most obvious form of electromagnetic spectrum intelligence comes
from cameras and thermal imagers mounted on various platforms,
including battlefield drones. However, much can be learned from the
emissions of enemy units. Even if signals cannot be interpreted, the fact
they are being emitted at all indicates something is there and often the
nature of a signal gives away its origins. Advanced sensors allow the
user to 'see' electronic emissions either plotted on a map or displayed
on a visor, allowing tactical decisions to be made based upon radio and
sensor emissions from enemy forces that are otherwise invisible.
```

```
Electronic intelligence also touches on the field of cyber-warfare but that
is rightly considered a separate field by most military forces. Cyberwarfare
units are maintained by advanced militaries but their function is usually
more strategic than tactical. A cyber-attack might be used to obtain
information that is then fed to the troops at the front or to cripple an
enemy force's capabilities.
```

```
105
```

Most battlefield electronic warfare equipment is built to a standard set of
protocols, giving a 'plug and fight' capability providing the correct access
codes are available. This makes a unit's data network a little less secure
than a bespoke system but the benefits in reduced cost are far greater
than the risks.

Most electronic warfare equipment is used with the Electronics (sensors) skill.

#### >> EQUIPMENT SECTION <<

Unit Data Network

A unit data network kit is designed to outfit a small unit of up to 12
personnel. Each soldier is provided with a personal heads-up display
that can be in the form of a helmet visor, goggles or a holographic display
unit carried on a headset. The unit also contains a small camera and
scrambled data transmitter/receiver.

The display unit uses shielded electronics that are difficult to detect when
not transmitting and has a 'hold transmission/cease transmission' feature
to allow a solider to 'go silent' if the enemy is scanning for transmissions.
This deprives others of a data feed from the soldier's equipment but still
permits reception, allowing a scout or sniper to advance into a scanned
zone and take up position whilst receiving warning of electronic 'hotspots'
and targeting information from sensors beyond the scanned area.

The unit's sensors include an electromagnetic radiation detection system,
which has multiple uses. A simple audio tone is used to inform the soldier
that they are close to a source of emissions, rising in pitch and pulse
rate as the source gets closer and/or stronger. This is primarily useful
for finding enemy forward observers and scouts using communications
systems or to locate targets during an infiltration mission. One additional
benefit is the early detection of some advanced mines and traps, which
often have electromagnetic emissions. The unit does not detect simple
pressure devices.

```
Personal Heads-up Display
```

106

```
Although the individual soldier's kit is useful on its own, it is intended
to be used as part of a unit's data network. One central processing/
dissemination station is included in the kit. This is a two kilograms
laptop-sized unit in a robust armored case, which processes all data
from individual kits and any other systems the unit is patched into. No
additional sensors or equipment are provided in the basic kit.
```

```
The user of the processing station can let it run simple automated
procedures – this is popular in units that lack electronic warfare experts
```

- or can manually control what data it provides to whom. Automated
procedures include the following.

```
TacMap
The unit can be set to feed a tactical map (usually seen from above or
as an isometric offset) to all personnel in the network. The quality of
information displayed depends on additional sensors available but in the
least the display shows a map of the combat area built up from soldiers'
camera feeds and any plans accessed from available data networks.
The TacMap shows the locations of friendlies who are transmitting and
last known locations of those who are not.
```

```
If the unit has taken the time to set-up report codes that can be interpreted
by the automated unit – or an operator implements them manually – the
status of friendlies can be indicated with various symbols. Knowing that
the support gunner's weapon is not available can be useful, although
information is of necessity limited. The symbol does not indicate whether
the gun is down due to a malfunction, lack of ammunition or has been
dropped in a well but at least the squad knows they cannot rely upon it.
```

```
Hostiles and sensor contacts can also be displayed in this manner if they
have been identified to the system. This is usually a matter of pointing the
user's camera at a person or object and giving a one-word identification
code. Threats such as mines and barbed wire can be flagged this way,
along with suspected enemy strongpoints, objectives and any other
points of interest.
```

```
If additional sensors are available, the TacMap feature can also display
thermal or electromagnetic maps of an area, which can be overlaid
to indicate the type of radiation detected and give an indication of the
nature of the source. It is also sometimes used for planning or a 'virtual
rehearsal' of actions the squad is about to take.
```

```
X-Ray Vision
With the right information feeds, a display can be created to provide
images of what lies behind walls or other obstructions. This is inevitably
referred to as 'X-ray vision' despite it having nothing to do with X-rays.
The skill of the operator is important when attempting to interpret this sort
of data in a tactical context – it is easy to become confused about what
obstructions are on which side of the target. Thus the feature is more
commonly used for specific purposes such as setting up a precise shot.
```

```
107
```

In this case, the operator of the main unit needs to make a Difficult (10+)
Electronics (sensors) check. If successful, the tactical situation on the
other side of a wall or obstruction is fed to a sniper or similar specialist. It
is necessary to have sensors in place that can see the obstructed area,
of course. Using this data, a sniper can fire at targets they cannot see
using a normal Gun Combat or Heavy Weapons check. If the obstruction
is solid, it will have to be penetrated (any additional Protection taken into
account) but the sniper can shoot in the right place.

Automatic Alerts
The TacMap feature can be combined with additional sensors to alert
the user if hostiles or unknown contacts move into certain areas and
run pre-selected responses if desired. For example, a unit could be set-up to detonate mines or distraction devices such as flashbangs when
someone who is not a member of the force enters a particular area. This
feature must be used with caution as it can create chaos or result in
collateral casualties but in the right context it is very useful.

Micro-Reconnaissance Drone Kit

Micro-Reconnaissance Drones, or MRD, resemble a tiny helicopter with a
rotor span of less than two centimeters. Four are provided in the kit along
with a small control unit and set of goggles that display what the drones
can see with their cameras. These include all-round thermal/optic units
and a forward-facing high-resolution camera with an impressive zoom
capability for such a small unit. The MRD makes very little noise and can
pass through unexpectedly small spaces, enabling it to enter a building
or even a vehicle the enemy thinks is immune to internal surveillance.

Autohack Unit

```
An Autohack unit is a handheld device capable of semi-remotely
interfacing with an electronic lock. 'Semi-remotely' in this case means
the Autohack unit can operate from two to three meters away from the
target, depending on how cluttered the local electronic environment is. It
cannot penetrate complex systems such as computers, nor is it any use
with simple electrical devices. However, an Autohack unit is capable of
making a brute-force attempt to override or disable electronic locks using
a code or similar single-function devices.
```

```
An Autohack unit can attempt to lock or unlock a door, or make the
device carry out one simple function such as turning off a poorly secured
robot or triggering/disabling an alarm. This takes 1D
seconds per TL of the target and is successful
on a roll of 10+ on 2D. A DM equal to the
difference in TL between the device and the
target is applied. If the attempt is failed,
the user can simply try again – although
many electronic security systems
have alarms or super-secure modes
triggered by a hacking attempt.
```

```
The Autohack unit gains a
DM equal to the difference
between its TL and that of its
target. However, it cannot
penetrate a target of
higher than its own

Comspotter

A Comspotter is a very simple electronic sensor that picks up emissions
from radio equipment and other systems that emit in the electromagnetic
spectrum. It does not attempt to decipher the signals but indicates to the
user the direction, distance and strength of the signal. If the signal is of a
common type, the Comspotter will indicate
its nature to the user. Occasionally
a Comspotter can be wildly wrong,
perhaps identifying the safety-zone
radar of an automated cargo loading
robot as an aerospace defence battery
but usually the transmission is pegged
as being in the right general class.
Thus, if the user is informed that
there are emissions from personal
communications radios 40 meters to the
west and a radar-frequency emission
100 meters north, they can be reasonably
sure they will encounter something similar
when they investigate.

Electronic Mapping Rocket

Mapping rockets are a cheap and simple way to obtain an electronic-systems map of an area – and to advertise your own presence to
everyone within several kilometers. They are sometimes used by
prospectors to find magnetic materials and explorers to map out
the ruins of an advanced culture by its power conduits but more are
commonly used to build an instant picture of every piece of inductively
responsive material within 500 meters.

The rocket is launched over the target area and explodes, creating
a weak electromagnetic pulse. Inductive materials such as wiring,
electronic systems and any object or structure that contains materials
like iron or nickel will respond to the pulse, which is not strong enough
to damage anything but sufficient to induce a small electrical current
in electronic systems or materials that shield them. A separate sensor,
included in a unit data network (page 105) or available as a reusable

```
standalone device for Cr300, picks-up induced currents and creates a
map of the area. Non-inductive materials such as brick walls are totally

EMP Pulser

An EMP Pulser is a device small enough to be carried on a belt or in

capable of overwhelming nearby radio receivers and similar devices
with static. The pulse will not affect military electronics of TL9+ or civilian
systems of TL11+. It will render radios and other systems useless within
50 meters and provides an unmissable emergency beacon for distressed
personnel. The pulse is detectable to 10 kilometers or more with good
sensors such as those aboard a starship and cannot escape notice
within one or two kilometers with even the most rudimentary scanning
equipment. However, its main purpose is to 'white out' communications
of enemy personnel within a combat area.

Stickams

Stickams are disposable wide-angle cameras with limited low-light and
thermal capability, contained in a nearly flat palm-sized unit that can
be slapped onto almost any surface. Stickams normally stay stuck to
the target surface indefinitely until activated but have power only for
three to five days. They communicate by low-powered radio frequency
transmissions and can be used to create a net covering a base or
secured area. A pack contains 10 stickable-cameras (stickams) that
cannot be recharged. Power comes from a slow chemical reaction in the
gel, which also serves as an adhesive; stickams will fall off their surfaces
once discharged. They are not obtrusive but will be spotted in a search.

##### ZHODANI MILITARY ORGANISATION

```
The Zhodani Consulate uses a different military organization to the
Imperium, for a variety of reasons. One is the long development of the
Consulate; another is the highly stratified nature of Zhodani society. The
inclusion of psionic units also imposes different requirements to militaries
deploying more conventional forces.
```

```
For conventional forces, Zhodani terms have been replaced with their
nearest Imperial equivalent for clarity. Specialist formations use a
different terminology better suited to their unique nature. The majority
of Zhodani forces are composed of lift infantry, a predominantly infantry
force with grav transport and support from artillery and armored
vehicles. Lift infantry formations are mobile, resilient and adaptable,
making them capable of handling most tasks without requiring the use
of specialist forces.
```

```
LIFT INFANTRY BATTALION


The lift infantry battalion is one of the most common ground formations
of the Zhodani military. These units comprise 32% of the Zhodani
combat battalions known to be in the Spinward Marches. In Consular
Guard formations, two lift infantry battalions are found in the lift infantry
regiments and lift mechanised regiments of their respective divisions.
In regular army formations, there are three lift infantry battalions in the
lift infantry regiments of a lift infantry division, two in the lift mechanised
regiments of a lift mechanised division and lift cavalry division, two in
the grav tank regiment of a grav tank division and one in the grav tank
regiment of a lift cavalry division.
```

```
The lift infantry battalion is organised along standard lines, with a
headquarters company and four rifle companies for a total of 799
personnel. Most of these vehicles are grav sleds of one sort or another,
typically variants of the same design to ease maintenance problems.
The same organization is used in both lift infantry and lift mechanised
regiments. The difference between the two is in the number and type of
other battalions in the regiment.
```

```
Headquarters Company
The headquarters company contains a point defence platoon, nuclear
damper section, maintenance platoon, quartermaster platoon, medical
platoon, communications platoon, psionic detachment and command
post platoon, for a total of 167 personnel. As with all combat formations,
this 'paper' strength can vary considerably in the field.

vehicle commanders are psi talented, with telepathy and/or clairvoyance
abilities. Additionally, the recon group contains 18 commissioned
specialists, all psi talented, with clairvoyance. The assault group
consists of six assault teams. Each team has two scramblers and one
director. Scramblers have telekinetic abilities, while the director has
clairvoyance and telepathy.
```

```
Rifle Company (Lift)
Rifle companies are the backbone of the lift infantry. All personnel in a lift
infantry division are equipped with combat armor and most are armed
with gauss rifles and RAM grenades. Each squad of a rifle company has
one PGMP-14 as a support weapon. Individually-carried tac missiles are
issued as the tactical situation warrants. Lift infantry battalions in grav
tank, mechanised infantry and lift cavalry regiments are equipped with
combat armor and armed with PGMP-13s, while FGMP-14s are used
as the squad support weapon.

The main fighting strength of a rifle company is its rifle squads. Each rifle
squad contains one NCO, one gunner, one vehicle commander, eight
infantry and one grav APC. Each rifle company contains 158 personnel.

Tactical Employment
Zhodani doctrine for the employment of lift infantry is almost identical
to Imperial doctrine, so only the use of the psion detachment will be
dealt with here. The scramblers of the assault teams are most often
used in conjunction with attacks on enemy fortified positions that cannot
be neutralised by firepower. Immediately prior to the infantry assault on
the position, scramblers will disrupt the defence by telekinetically pulling
pins on grenades, squeezing triggers on defenders' weapons, activating
safeties and so forth.

116

```
Troops experienced in combat with Zhodani troops are accustomed to
such tactics and take steps to minimise the effects. Fortified positions
are provided with grenade sumps and troops are careful to either
keep weapons pointed outwards through embrasures or unloaded.
Nevertheless, the scrambler assault will clearly mark the position for non-psionic assault troops and supress
the defenders' ability to
fire for several seconds.
Properly exploited, this is
often a critical advantage
for the attackers.
```

```
117
```

COMMANDO GROUPMENT



The Zhodani commando forces are considered by some experts to
be the most dangerous troops opposing the Imperium. Despite the 95
groupments (battalion-sized units) known to be in the Spinward Marches
represent only 2% of Zhodani combat battalions in the sector, the
commandos cause disruption and morale deterioration greatly out of
proportion to their actual number.

Jump commando groupments are part of each jump regiment of a jump
division and one jump commando groupment is attached directly to
each lift infantry and lift mechanised division. Three groupments (two
jump) are attached directly to a Consular Guard corps as part of the
corps troops. In regular army formations, one groupment is attached
to each corps.

Unlike other Zhodani units, which have only a small detachment of
psionic specialists attached to each battalion headquarters, most of the
personnel in a commando groupment (422 out of 531) are psi talented. Of
these, 36 are clairvoyant/telepaths and 384 are teleporters. All psi talents
in the Zhodani armed forces are issued autoinjectors of psi-enhancing
drugs, although a commando groupment will seldom make more than
two jumps per day and never more than three. Distances travelled rarely
exceed five to 50 kilometers because of the disorientation involved and
effects of energy and momentum differences.

A point of minor interest is the fact that the unit consists largely of
officer-equivalents. In the Zhodani military, those with psionic talents
cannot hold enlisted rank. The lowest rank held by a psionic talent is
that of commissioned specialist, roughly equivalent to the lowest officer
grade in the Imperial military. Commissioned specialists are officers by
virtue of their special talents, however, and although they hold officer
equivalent rank they are not in the chain of command and do not give
orders. An example in the Imperial military is that of a military doctor,
who holds a commission and officer-equivalent rank but is not in the
chain of command.

In addition, some positions require both psi talent and command
responsibilities, such as the commander of a groupment. The reason for
this is that any Zhodani with psi talent is automatically made a member of
the upper classes (Intendants or Nobles). Technicians, drivers, gunners,
non-commissioned officers (NCOs) and so on are proles.

A commando groupment is organised into a headquarters squadron
and three commando squadrons. Jump commando groupments are
organised identically, the only difference being that all personnel
are jump trained. The commando groupment contains a total of 531
personnel and 59 vehicles.

118

```
Headquarters Squadron
The headquarters squadron is lightly equipped and intended for rapid
mobility. It contains all the support elements for the groupment, plus a
small security/reserve force.

Although Zhodani commandos make attacks using teleportation, they
require considerable backup as only a limited amount of equipment can

**Commando Squadron**
The commando squadrons are the main striking force of the battalion.
Personnel are equipped with battle dress and PGMP-13s, with the FGMP-14 as squad support weapon. Troops not intended to directly engage the
enemy as a primary role, such as drivers and communications personnel,
use combat armor and are equipped with gauss rifles. Personnel ride in
grav APCs when not making a teleporting attack.

an assistant group leader (lieutenant), a group director (lieutenant), a
clairvoyant/telepath and eight commissioned specialists. All personnel
are teleporters.

120

```
Tactical Employment
The principal difficulty of most commando operations lies with inserting the
commando force behind the enemy lines in close proximity to its target.
Zhodani commandos accomplish this by psionic teleportation and recruits
for commando units are chosen solely on the basis of their talent in this
field. Zhodani commandos do not occupy the role of elite combat troops,
unlike most other armies.
```

```
In long-range penetration missions, where teleport disorientation is to be
expected, commandos jump to previously reconnoitred safe areas, such
as small clearings in woods, where they can
recover from the teleport and then move
out against their objective. In short range
teleports, commandos are sometimes
inserted directly onto the battlefield and
open fire almost
```

```
immediately. ln this
regard, they are often
used in retrograde operations
to disrupt an enemy advance,
being inserted immediately behind
advancing enemy units to ambush
follow-up forces or even attack
spearhead forces from behind.
```

```
Another problem encountered in
commando operations is that of
recovering the troops after the
mission is conducted. Zhodani
commandos usually accomplish
this by teleportation also. The best
defence against commando raids is
to mine or monitor every possible
assembly point, a task nearly
impossible and which draws great
numbers of troops from the forward
lines. For this reason, a commando
groupment can weaken the enemy's
defences without actually doing anything.

'PORT PORTER' TRANSPORT VEHICLE

The Port Porter is a simple, cheap utility vehicle intended for use by
anyone needing to move a modest amount of equipment or cargo around
a safe environment. It is a no-frills vehicle but a highly useful one that can
be encountered almost anywhere.

Built on a light ground vehicle chassis in pickup truck configuration, Port
Porters are often customised to fulfil other roles, especially at backwater
ports where more advanced transportation is unavailable. They can thus
be encountered with a closed van at the rear instead of open cargo area
or with passenger seats for service as a rather crude starport bus. In
this configuration it is common to fit a fabric awning over the passenger
area to keep sun and light rain off, leading to this sort of vehicle being
disparagingly known as a 'clothtop'. Port Porters also serve as transport
for ground crews and carry their equipment, which may be permanently
secured in the pickup bed.

'PORT PROTECTOR'

LIGHT SECURITY VEHICLE



Built on the same chassis as the Port Porter, the Port Protector is visually
identical unless weapons are mounted, although most operators choose
to make their security vehicles highly visible as a deterrent. Almost
everything about this vehicle is upgraded from the original design, from
suspension to sunroof glazing. Improved communications and control
systems are backed up by an autopilot with an 'autopatrol' setting. This
allows the vehicle to be sent out without a crew if necessary, conducting a
sensor patrol of the installation perimeter. This is useful for fence-checking
and similar routine tasks if more specialized equipment is not available.

Whilst not any faster than the humble Port Porter, the Port Protector
handles much better and can cross rugged terrain. This, combined with its
extended range, has prompted some observers to wonder if the vehicle was
not intended for a different market to installation security. No weapons are
fitted as standard but the pintle mount can take any light support weapon
such as a machinegun. This has made the Port Protector popular with
armed security firms operating on mid-tech worlds, low-budget mercenary
units and various flavors of insurgent group. When serving as a light
weapons carrier a vehicle of this type is usually known as a 'technical'.

Nominal crew is five – four in the cab and one in the pickup bed manning
the pintle weapon. However, additional personnel can be piled into
the rear of the vehicle with a considerable degree of discomfort when
making a short trip. The cab and critical systems are armored against
intermediate calibre rifle fire – they will protect against small arms long
enough to return fire or escape but offer little protection against anti-vehicle weapons. This is a perfectly acceptable trade-off in a Cr46000
vehicle, say the manufacturers, and the marketplace seems to agree
with them. Port Protectors are a standard security vehicle throughout
much of Charted Space.

##### LSP-JCSDB MODEL 12

The Third Frontier War (979 to 986 Imperial) deviated from previous
wars with the Zhodani. Whereas they were characterised more by large
planetary sieges, the Third saw much more commerce raiding, attacks
on outlying planets within star systems and other smaller actions. A
need for a system defense boat with limited jump capabilities surfaced,
one able to relocate itself to a nearby stellar companion or another
system that was threatened.

In early 983, the first of the Ling Standard Products Jump Capable
System Defense Boats Model 12 floated out of the drydocks around
Regina. Critics immediately lambasted the idea of calling any vessel
capable of jump travel a 'boat' but the designers stuck with the name.
Since the vessel's primary intention was for extended operations within a
star system, they felt the name appropriate.

Built around a 500-ton hull, the sleek, aerodynamic vessel is at home in
both atmosphere and space. Its integrated fuel scoops and purification
plant allows it to replenish its fuel tanks from multiple sources, including
liquid water or gas giant atmosphere. Fuel is typically not a problem,
however, unless the jump drive is utilised. Once the tank is full, the fusion
power plant can sip the jump reserves and operate at full power for over
a year. If the crew powered down most systems, especially the hungry
maneuver drive, the vessel could operate for many years without
needing to refuel.

With extended duration in mind, crew comforts were not ignored. Unlike
most military vessels, the LSP-JCSDB provides private quarters for
each crew member. The additions of a library, workshop, biosphere
and plenty of common areas help to alleviate the stagnation felt by
most crews on station.

Deviating from the standard armament of its class, the LSP-JCSDB
lacks missile weapons. The designers felt equipping the vessel with
such weapons would detract from its endurance by necessitating the
need to rearm. Instead, the class relies on its small particle beam
bay to serve as its heavy hitter, backed up by a pair of particle beam
barbettes. Combined, the three weapons are capable of dealing with
any threat in the vessel's class. A pair of triple pulse lasers were added
for lighter duty and missile defence.

126

```
Rounding out its list of equipment, the LSP-JCSDB includes a breaching
tube and tow cable for any vessel that needs to be dealt with up close,
along with a brig to incarcerate captives. The addition of the ship's boat
gives the crew flexibility to be in two places at once, if needed. The
housing for it easily facilitates removal and replacement, allowing the
drive itself to be manufactured at a different location than the vessel and
inserted upon completion.
