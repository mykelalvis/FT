The Phirric family arrived on [[Brufort]] during the early days of settlement and it was their influence within the [[Imperium]] and their fortune that helped fund some of the initial mining expeditions. They have remained an influential part of the planet, serving on the board of [[Brufort#Morskoi Offshore Drilling]] since its foundation. Many members of the family have also served as the local regent and Bertrus is the latest in a long line of Phirrics to carry the title. While he is a fair administrator and is very personable, Bertrus has always been easily swayed by those he views as more significant or influential than he is. He made the acquaintance of [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] when they were in university together and is one of the few people who knows his true lineage; Bertrus was taken in by the tales his friend told about the 'unfair treatment' his family endured. Easily swayed when Alistair approached him offering [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]]'s services, he has been complicit as [[Alistair Humbolt|the Lost Duke]] took more and more control over [[Brufort]]. Deep down Bertrus knows his inaction is hurting his people but is fearful of [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]]'s wrath and it has kept him passive as more and more of [[Brufort]] slips away.
