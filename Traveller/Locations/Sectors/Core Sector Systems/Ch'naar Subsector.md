![[TImp-ChnaarSubsector.jpg]][[TImp-ChnaarSubsector.jpg|Ch'naar]]
Ch’naar is dominated by its capital, Aursis, which owns four other worlds in the subsector. Aursis has owned Okefir and Vala since they were initially colonized in the year 57 but more recently acquired Diam Kani and Siniir Sa. Aursis allegedly has its sights set on Anshar as well. [[Duchess Colyere Hajesta daMae]] of Aursis claims that Aursis’ presence on so many worlds is necessary to prevent a full-blown Chanestin insurgency from the Dunea subsector. Dubious Imperial intelligence officials and the Duchess’ rivals in the Moot have expressed concern that she is overstepping her boundaries and attempting to carve out an empire within the empire. Despite the Duchess’ ravenous appetite for worlds, the Imperium has thus far resisted the urge to rein her in. The Sector Fleet has made some noise about sending squadrons to Zagi Uun to monitor the situation more closely but no moves have been made as yet.

Critics in the media and at court wonder if the whole thing is not just an elaborate bit of political theatre. The threat of a Chanestin insurgency is real and the presence of a bold and boisterous counterweight in the region might actually serve the Imperium well. While the Imperial Navy Admiralty has often expressed concern about Aursis’ aggression towards its neighbors, it could be a case of ‘they doth protest too much’. Aursis’ strong presence in Ch’naar might block the Chanestin from further expansion. It might well be that the Imperium is wilfully letting Aursis flex its muscles in the region so that the Imperial Navy does not have to.

As for the worlds conquered by Aursis, they have been – to this point, anyway – mostly low-population systems with only minor holdings. Despite dramatic shows of force when taking each star system, Aursisian troops actually encountered little to no resistance when acquiring Diam Kani and Siniir Sa. Furthermore, Aursis has not instituted martial law on any of the captured worlds; if anything, laws have become less restrictive under the Aursisian aegis.

The one exception is Okefir, whose gradual rise in technology and increasing population has spurred an independence movement. Aursisian occupiers have made it quite clear to the Okefiri that they have no intention of granting the world self-rule. An Okefiri resistance movement has begun to form and they like their chances against their oppressors. While Aursis has a significant technological advantage, the harsh desert environment of Okefir is not something Aursisian troops are used to and a war of attrition could come out in Okefir’s favour.

Headquartered at Aursis, the 150th Fleet consists of six squadrons and is heavily used as an instrument of force and intimidation throughout the subsector. The bulk of the squadrons maintain an ominous presence in the Ekhuurme and Dimanaam systems, where the Duchess claims she is keeping a watchful eye on the Chanestin worlds to trailing for the sake of Imperial security. Ekhuurme has a large Chanestin minority whom the Aursisians gleefully oppress. The flagship of the 150th is a hardy prototype of the new Voroshilef - class battleship which the shipyards at Dimanaam hope to make a staple of the Sector Fleet. The less-well-appointed 150th Colonial Fleet is tasked with patrolling Ch’naar’s spinward flank.

Tensions run high in Ch’naar, with nine systems designated as Amber Zones. Many of these worlds have been spurred into action to help prevent Chanestin incursions and their Amber Zone classifications reflect a heightened level of anxiety. For their part, Chanestin populations profess not to know what all the fuss is about. They have made it clear that they see themselves as a distinct culture, worthy of all the rights and protections afforded to the Lancians, Luriani and Antareans in other sectors. They have not violated Imperial laws in any way, shape or form and see no reason for the Imperium to fear them. Furthermore, they claim to have no territorial aspirations beyond those of their original 25 worlds.
