# INTRODUCTION

This adventure takes place on the planet [[Brufort]], located within the [[Gulf subsector]] of [[Deneb Sector|Deneb]]. The Gulf is one of the few areas of Deneb that lies outside of the direct control of one of the sector duchies and this has allowed planets like [[Brufort]] to fall between the cracks and forge its own fortunes. The planet has many valuable natural resources and the local populace has made a good living capitalising on the bounty of their world. Unfortunately, the same resources are a valuable prize to those willing to exploit the good people of [[Brufort]] and the Travellers find themselves in the middle of all this.

The Travellers are tasked with locating a missing cargo freighter for the Sharurshid shipping corporation. During the course of their investigation the Travellers will arrive on the planet [[Brufort]] and soon find themselves trapped in the settlement of [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]]. While on paper the world is governed by a local regent, in truth the power behind the proverbial throne is a member of the infamous [[Humbolt family]] who once wielded great power within the [[Deneb sector]]. The so-called 'Lost Duke' sees [[Brufort]] as a lucrative holding and has established his dominance over the populace by controlling the only means to keep dangerous native insects at bay. He also does not want his presence to be revealed to any of the sector dukes and especially to agents of the [[Imperium]] , so his agents will do their best to keep the Travellers from leaving. The Travellers find allies in a local group of resistance seeking to free [[Brufort]] from [[Alistair Humbolt|the Lost Duke]]'s control and by aiding these freedom fighters the Travellers may find a way to escape the planet before it is too late.

The adventure is suitable for any group of Travellers but it is recommended for groups of four to six and the Referee may need to adjust encounter difficulties if the group is smaller or larger. There are some encounters where combat and infiltration skills would be useful but they are not essential for all Travellers. It is also recommended the Travellers have someone with the Pilot skill and access to a starship, although one will be provided by their employer, if necessary. The Travellers may not have access to their normal weaponry and equipment during the adventures but there will be opportunities to acquire additional equipment. It should be noted guns alone will not cinch a victory for the Travellers in combat and enemies have superior numbers and are well equipped. Good tactics, use of the environment and deployment of allies are all important if the Travellers want to win the day.

### RECOVERY MISSION

The Travellers are contacted by a recovery specialist named Tebor Thuel from Sharurshid and asked to help search for a missing cargo vessel called [[#the Radiant Maiden]]. The ship set off from Tuwyak and was to arrive in the Lilad system in the Zeng subsector a little over two months ago. Word got back to the corporation the vessel never arrived and Thuel was tasked with locating the ship in an attempt to recover it and its cargo. His role as a recovery specialist for the corporation gives him the latitude to hire independent contractors to aid in search efforts, using them to gather evidence for any potential loss claims for the vessel and its holdings in case it cannot be recovered.

How Thuel comes into contact with the Travellers depends on how this adventure is being used. If it is a side mission unrelated to the main story of a larger campaign, or if this adventure is being used on its own, the exact reasons for the Traveller's involvement may not be necessary and they can start already in the employ of Sharurshid or as contractors for Thuel. If this adventure is being incorporated into an ongoing campaign, the Travellers could be hired based on the reputation or one of their Allies or Contacts could help make contact with Thuel to present them with the job opportunity. Taking time to research Sharurshid with a Routine (6+) Admin check (1D hours, INT) informs the Travellers that the corporation has a good track record and is known for fair rates for independent contractors. Travellers with military or security backgrounds might be head- hunted by Thuel and those with less than reputable backgrounds might be useful to the recovery specialist for their shady information sources to track purchases of the missing cargo.

The Travellers are provided with the jump path of [[#the Radiant Maiden]] and every system it was supposed to pass through on its way to [[Zeng]]. The ship was to stop in the [[Brufort]] system and then on to Taomina before entering the [[Zeng subsector]] for its final push to [[Zeng]] to unload the last of its cargo. They are also given the make and specifications of the _Radiant Maiden_ to use as a guide to aid in tracking its course and to compare if they are able to locate the ship (or what's left of it). The vessel is a modified [[TravellerCore#SUBSIDISED MERCHANT TYPE R| subsidised merchant]] with a jump-2 drive and double pulse laser turret for defence. The crew has worked for [[Sharurshid]] for several years and has made many trips during that time and the ship was inspected prior to departure and certified to be in good condition. The Travellers are given basic dossiers on the crew, including photographs and basic personal information.

Thuel wants the Travellers to follow [[#the Radiant Maiden]]'s flight path and check in with port authorities in each system to see if the vessel made contact or there were any reports of possible pirate activity. If the Travellers do not have access to a ship the corporation will provide an older model stock scout/courier [[TravellerCore#SCOUT/COURIER|stock scout/courier]]. They are paid Cr10000 upfront and will receive another Cr50000 if they are able to locate the vessel or provide confirmation of its destruction if it befell a tragic fate.

> [!info]- DOSSIER ON THE RADIANT MAIDEN
>
> If the Travellers take time to review the dossier provided on [[#the Radiant Maiden]] and its crew, they learn the following information:
>
> - Captain Theresa Redfort: A decorated naval veteran, Captain Redfort commanded [[#the Radiant Maiden|the Maiden]] for most of its 15 years of operation. Her service record with [[Sharurshid]] is spotless and she was considered to be one of their best pilots and a fair commander. She recently put in notice of her impending retirement, scheduled six months from the time of the dossier's last update.
> - Killian Orthus: The first mate and co-pilot of [[#the Radiant Maiden]] , Killian has been part of Captain Redfort's crew for the past eight years. He finished his commission in the Imperial Navy and was already familiar with the captain from her time there and she recommended him when her previous first mate retired.
> - Verghzaz : A member of the bridge crew serving as systems operator and medic, the Vargr Verghzaz has served on [[#the Radiant Maiden|the Maiden]] for three years. His initial service record notes reprimands for insubordination but the last two years have been good and the captain noted he had some 'growing pains' in adjusting to her command.
> - Bertie Langstrom: Another member of the bridge crew serving as the astrogator, Bertie was a mathematics prodigy and had several cybernetic augmentations to aid in complex jumpspace calculations. She served on two other Sharurshid vessels before transferring to [[#the Radiant Maiden|the Maiden]] two years ago.
> - Igor Lebenov: The senior engineer of [[#the Radiant Maiden|the Maiden]] , Igor has been part of the crew for the past 12 years and was one of Captain Redfort's most loyal crewmembers. He was a skilled engineer and very protective of the ship and its crew, and it is noted he had also put in notice that he would be retiring around the same time as the captain.
> - [[#Yusef Masih]]: The newest member of [[#the Radiant Maiden|the Maiden]]'s crew, Yusef was brought on as a secondary engineer nine months prior to assist Igor with ship maintenance and operations. Although the Travellers are not aware of this point, Yusef is the only surviving member of [[#the Radiant Maiden|the Maiden]]'s crew.
>
> They are also provided with a cargo manifest for the ship. [[#the Radiant Maiden|The Maiden]] was transporting shipments of clothing from high end manufacturers on Trin, economy ground cars bound for Zeng and various foodstuffs designated for several points in between. [[#the Radiant Maiden|The Maiden]] is also carrying packages and mail destined for systems it was scheduled to pass through. While nothing stands out as being a particularly valuable prize, this does not mean [[#the Radiant Maiden|the Maiden]] did not fall prey to raiders or other opportunistic parasites looking for easy Credits.

# REFEREE'S INFORMATION

The following information on the setting, and important characters for this adventure, is provided for the Referee alone to help prepare them to run this adventure. Travellers may learn some of the information below throughout the course of this adventure and it is up to the Referee to determine what details are revealed based on what actions the Travellers take to learn more about the locations and people involved. Also note that while this information is provided to help with running the adventure, Referees may feel free to alter details as needed to best fit their campaign.

## THE HUMBOLTS AND THE LOST DUKE

The story of the rise and fall of the [[Humbolt family]] is well known throughout [[Deneb Sector|Deneb]] but like most stories it has been tainted by embellishment, false narratives and wild conspiracies. Within the sector the Humbolts remain political bogeymen, serving as an object lesson for those in power and a threat for those who try to reach too far with their ambitions. While the history of the [[Humbolt family|Humbolts]] is well known, the truth about what happened after their fall is murky. Conspiracy theories make for good tales to tell in the halls of power but there is some truth to the stories of the family seeking to regain their glory days. The [[Imperium]] ] made it law that no Humbolt may ever hold a title or position of authority, so the descendants of the original Humbolts have situated themselves as the ones behind the thrones. Under different names they whisper into the ears of those in power or manipulate the fortunes of vast corporations to suit their long term goals. Many still simmer over lost fortunes and look forward to the day when they can emerge from the shadows to reclaim their place among the elite.

[[Alistair Humbolt]] is one of the young and hungry new generation of the family, raised on tales of their glory days of old and dreams of the generation before him to reclaim their birth right. He has been seeking an opportunity to prove himself to his elders in the hopes that he can take on a more prominent role within the family's long-term plans. Under the alias of [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair Halker]] he heads a private security company called [[Pernach Solutions]] specialising in services to independent colonies and settlements without established law enforcement. [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] uses this as an opportunity to gain control of settlements and their resources to help fund his ambitions.

He was familiar with [[Regent Phirric]] from their days at university and sent representatives to [[Brufort]] to see if it would be suitable for expansion. The presence of [[Zuchai crystals]] made it a valuable prize and [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]]'s agents moved quickly to manipulate the populace by sowing fears about outside forces coming to take their mines and livelihood. It was not long before he was able to secure a contract with the regent and install [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] as the main policing force in [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]]. [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] also offered the settlement improved subsonic emitters to help with the [[Crimson Locusts]] and both services were provided in exchange for a sizable amount of shares in the mines. [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] arrived on planet shortly afterwards, setting himself up with the regent and working to acquire more power over the populace and lucrative mining operations. To that end [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] has ordered his people to purchase shares in the local mining companies from their employees and those reluctant to sell find themselves subject to increased scrutiny by [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] or incarceration based on dubious charges. While he has not gained a majority interest in any one mining company, [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]]'s control over the security forces and infrasound emitters has made him the de facto ruler of Brufort. Most are unaware of his connection to the Humbolt family, seeing him as a greedy businessman trying to take advantage of the backwater world. The regent is aware of [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]]'s lineage and knows he is losing control of the settlement to his old 'friend' but also sees having an ally within the Humbolts as a boon for his future ambitions. Due to his overbearing personality and facade of nobility, many in [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]] have started calling Alistair '[[Alistair Humbolt|the Lost Duke]]' as a sign of their disdain.

![[LstDuke-078.jpg|100]] ![[LstDuke-210.jpg|100]]

## Pernach on Brufort

Pernach has become the primary law enforcement agency on Brufort, with most of its people and resources concentrated in [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]]. [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] has brought along a few dozen of his best lieutenants to help oversee operations but a majority of the rank and file security agents are glorified thugs culled from the seedier parts of the sector. The total force [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] employs on [[Brufort]] numbers a little over 1,500 and most of these are located in [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]]. They are stationed in small security stations in each of the city's districts and [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]]'s main headquarters are in the office of the former constabulary not far from the [[Brufort#Office of the Regent|Office of the Regent]]. While [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] and his security chief [[Anton Craix]] are able to ensure the loyalty of these thugs through fair pay and good benefits, [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]]'s people are not above accepting a bribe to look the other way. They are also not above engaging in brutal tactics and petty crimes, knowing they are the only law on the planet and control the majority of weapons and the life-giving infrasound generators.

Pernach also maintains a tight grip on the starport so they can control traffic coming in and out as well as information. The compliance of the regent has allowed [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] to tighten its stranglehold, restrict legal possession of firearms among the populace and retain control over the lifesaving infrasound emitters. This last is the greatest means of control [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] has since he can turn off the emitters in an area with a flick of a switch and he has used the threat of an 'equipment malfunction' when concerns have been voiced about his influence.

Few of [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]]'s employees on [[Brufort]] are native to the planet but he has managed to gain the loyalty of some of the locals to help legitimise their presence there and to continue to sow the belief that outsiders could come any day to try to take the planet's resources. At first this tactic was effective but there is a growing number of people who have realised an outsider who has already come to try to take what is rightfully theirs. [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] has been able to prevent outright dissent thanks to his hold on the infrasound system but a small group in [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]] has formed an underground resistance and has been looking for ways to take control of the emitters from [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] to help free the planet from [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]]'s grip.

## THE FATE OF THE MAIDEN

While some remaining [[Humbolt family|Humbolts]] are content being the power behind the throne, other members of the family are still bitter about what might have been were they victorious during the [[Civil War]]. They still dream of being the masters of [[Deneb Sector|Deneb]] and simmer over their defeat at the hands of the [[Imperium|Third Imperium]]. There have been long standing rumours that the Humbolts in hiding have been amassing resources and a new fleet so that they can get revenge and there is some truth to this. One faction of the family has been slowly accumulating ships and armaments with the long term goal of using them to either mount an offensive on the Imperial fleet or secure several systems to establish their own empire.

Alistair's great uncle is part of this faction and also the one who helped fund his great-nephew's ambitions. Out of loyalty to his elder, [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] does what he can to secure ships via whatever means for his great uncle. In some cases, he has used his profits from [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] to purchase smaller vessels but also used a scheme where some of his men pose as corsairs to either secure ships or drive them to a place where more of his people can eliminate the crew and take the ship for their own.

Such was the fate of [[#the Radiant Maiden]]. After establishing himself on [[Brufort]], [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] ordered two of his armed scout ships to patrol the common exit points for ships past the 100 diameter limit. If a vessel was not worthy of time or attention, the ships passed themselves off as merchants or system patrol craft and let it pass. If it was a worthy prize, the ships would attack with the intent of either boarding or damaging it enough to force it to land at [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]]' starport for repairs. Once there the crew would be isolated by port security and evaluated to see if they would be willing to work for [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]]. If they were not willing to comply they would be eliminated, often by a tragic 'malfunction' of the infrasound emitters as they travelled the road between the starport and [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]].

[[#the Radiant Maiden|The Maiden]] was deemed worthy and driven to the planet's surface after its navigation systems were damaged by the attacking scout ships. Captain Redfort was shrewd enough to see the lay of the land on [[Brufort]] and politely declined the offer to work for [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]]. She was thrown into the jungle to the [[Crimson Locusts]] with all but one of her crew. The last member, a young man named [[#Yusef Masih]], was taken in by a local resistance group and is currently in hiding. [[#the Radiant Maiden|The Maiden]]is still at the starport in a large hangar and is slowly being repainted and reprogrammed before [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]]'s great uncle sends people to retrieve it for his makeshift fleet.

# TRACKING THE MAIDEN

Although the Travellers have latitude in deciding how to look for [[#the Radiant Maiden]] , recovery specialist Thuel recommends they follow the same course [[#the Radiant Maiden|the Maiden]] was supposed to follow. Once at each jump destination they can scan for possible signs of wreckage or debris, although the particulars of jump travel could make this option challenging since they will not know the exact point [[#the Radiant Maiden|the Maiden]] would have emerged from jumpspace. They are also encouraged to contact local port authorities to see if [[#the Radiant Maiden|the Maiden]] made contact or had to land for repairs.

Checking in at [[Tuwyak]] reveals [[#the Radiant Maiden]] departed on schedule and a system patrol boat registered the vessel on its instruments near a section of space used for jumps. [[#the Radiant Maiden|The Maiden]]was to make a one parsec jump to deep space before making another jump to Brufort's system. Once there they were to make contact with the port authorities to see if any mail needed to be transported to one of the systems [[#the Radiant Maiden|the Maiden]] would be travelling to and from there it would jump to Taomina. Stopping at the location of the first jump is a possibility but considering there is no way to know exactly where [[#the Radiant Maiden|the Maiden]] would have exited jumpspace within a vast region of empty space this option would prove to be a needle in a haystack.

### SIGNS OF PASSAGE

[[Brufort]] is the next destination in their search and as long as the Travellers make a Routine (6+) Astrogation check (1Dx10 minutes, EDU) they arrive at the same general point that [[#the Radiant Maiden|the Maiden]] emerged from jumpspace. While there is no way to know the exact position where [[#the Radiant Maiden|the Maiden]] would have arrived, the search area is sufficiently narrowed that the Travellers can make an Average (8+) Electronics (sensors) check (1Dx4 hours, EDU) to scan for any signs of the ship. If the check is successful, their sensors locate a cloud of metallic debris spread out over several hundred metres. The amount of material is relatively small but it compares with crystaliron hull plating and if the Travellers can collect some of the material they can find a component from a ship's navigation array and a serial number on the piece matches the information they have on [[#the Radiant Maiden|the Maiden]]. A Routine (6+) Engineer check (1Dx10 minutes) to analyse the debris indicates melting consistent with laser weaponry and that if the ship's navigation systems were damaged it would make a jump impossible until repaired or replaced.

![[LstDuke-092.jpg]]

![[LstDuke-097.jpg]]

### ON PATROL

As mentioned before, [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] has two armed scout ships on patrol at the 100 diameter limit for any incoming ships and if the Travellers remain in the area for more than 1D+4 hours they will be present when these ships conduct one of their patrols. The scout ships each patrol different sections of space but maintain frequent communication and their strategy is to have one approach a new vessel claiming to be a system patrol craft from Brufort. Each ship is distinctive from the other so one can pose as 'friendly' and the other can act as a pirate vessel if they determine the ship is a worthy target. One of the scout ships has green and silver colouration and is designated the _Proetus_ , while the other is red and grey and named the _Acrisius_. Only the 'friendly' ship will identify itself while the 'pirate' ship will go on the offensive and avoid communications unless absolutely necessary.

If they encounter the Travellers one will make contact, ask their business in the system and if they need any assistance. If the Travellers question why the ships are patrolling the area, the crew will use a story about recent pirate activity as cover. If the Travellers mention they are searching for the _Radiant Maiden_ , it will put the scout ship's crew on alert and they will suggest the Travellers speak with the port authority on [[Brufort]] for more information. The crew will send word back to [[Brufort]] about the Travellers and their inquiry about the missing ship.

The scout ship will also alert its compatriot about the Travellers and the other vessel will reroute on an intercept course. The ships have standing orders from [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] to attempt to force anyone inquiring about a lost ship to the planet so they can be questioned and eliminated if deemed a threat to his plans. The 'pirate' ship is a standard scout/courier armed with double pulse lasers and it will try to damage the Travellers' ship enough to compel it to land. As with [[#the Radiant Maiden|the Maiden]] , the crew will attempt to disable the Travellers' jump capabilities so they will not be able to flee the system. While disabling a ship is not an unusual action for pirates, if the Travellers take time to analyse the attacks they can make an Average (8+) Tactics (naval) check (1D minutes, INT). If this check is successful it becomes obvious that the scout ship was more concerned with disabling their ability to leave the system, which would not be typical behaviour for raiders seeking to take a ship or its cargo.

If the Travellers prove too challenging or attempt a boarding action, the scout ship will break off and try to flee into deep space to avoid destruction or capture. If the scout ship is unable to flee or the Travellers are dogged in their pursuit, it will request aid from the other ship and both will work together to drive the Travellers to Brufort. If the 'pirate' scout ship does something to disable the Traveller's ability to move, such as damaging their manoeuvre drive or power plant, the ship playing the part of the 'friendly' craft will arrive on scene and pretend to drive off the other ship before offering to lend assistance to help the Traveller's get to [[Brufort]] for repairs.

# Arrival on Brufort

Whether forced down by [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]]'s ships or arriving as part of their investigation, the Travellers will eventually make their way to Brufort. Orbital beacons direct all traffic to [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]] and an automated message directs incoming ships to make contact with the starport before landing. There is no traffic at the time of the Travellers arrival and the weather is clear so navigating through the atmosphere is smooth unless their ship is damaged. Travellers who research Brufort, either before arriving in the system or using their ship's computers can make an Average (8+) Investigate check (1D hours, EDU) and, if successful, they learn the basic information about [[Brufort]] including its climate, population and basic history as presented in [[#Referee Information]]. They also learn [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]] is the main settlement on the planet. If they succeed with Effect 3+ they are aware of the presence of Zuchai crystal mining as the main resource of the planet and with Effect 6+ the Travellers are aware of the [[Crimson Locusts]] and increased security presence on the planet for the past few years.

The Travellers can attempt to locate another landing site if they do not want to go to [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]] but there are no other established landing sites on the planet. There are several mining outposts and small agricultural settlements within 100 kilometres of [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]] but none have a location large enough for a ship to land. If the Travellers try to land in the jungle, their ship will be quickly swarmed by [[Crimson Locusts]] looking for a fresh meal.

> [!info]+ THE INFRASOUND OF SILENCE
> 
> A key aspect of this adventure is the ever present danger of the [[Crimson Locusts]] and the infrasound devices protecting the city. The transmitters are large white domes containing multi-directional sound emitters able to create a bubble of varying sizes depending on the size of the transmitter. They can be found along the exterior walls of [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]], along the road leading to the starport and surrounding the port itself. There are also transmitters along the docks and several emergency systems within the city in case of a system failure. The transmitters each have a range of about 500 metres in all directions.
> 
> The transmitters are linked to a central control system in each district, referred to as a 'hub'. Each of these hubs can activate and deactivate any transmitter in its district and they are all linked to a master control in [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]]'s residence. He has the ability to deactivate any transmitter in the city and its surroundings; something the ruling council was unaware of when they allowed [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] to install the updated system.
> 
> [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] has used his master control to quell uprisings and protests against [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] and sometimes he will shut off a transmitter just to satisfy his sadistic urges. The transmitters have an internal automated announcement that alerts anyone nearby to the shutdown, giving them time to seek shelter before the [[Crimson Locusts]] realise they can enter that section of the city. If the transmitter is reactivated it will drive off the locusts or incapacitate any remaining within its bubble. If the Referee wants to play up [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]]'s role as the villain he can deactivate a transmitter for no reason other than to show the power he holds over [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]]. The Travellers will witness the panic gripping the area and will be urged by citizens to seek shelter immediately.
> 
> Outlying communities and worksites have their own versions of the transmitters, often outdated or cobbled together. The mining groups have also created vehicles outfitted with short range transmitters to use when venturing into the jungles. A few have tried creating personal versions of the devices but the infrasound causes headaches and discomfort when in close proximity. Referees can have this affect the Travellers when they first arrive, having them make a Routine (6+) END check when first exposed to the blanket of infrasound. If the check is failed the Traveller suffers DM-2 to all checks for 1D+5 hours until they adjust to it.

The [[Brufort#Starport|starport]] outside [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]] is a basic facility with several plascrete landing areas and enclosed hangars for ship storage on planet. Most hangars are small and can hold ships no greater than 200 tons but one large hangar near the edge of the starport is significantly larger and can accommodate ships up to 600 tons. All hangars have security locks on access doors and the large hangar is surrounded by a four metre tall barbed wire fence. There is a small repair facility and the starport offers unrefined fuel obtained from [[Brufort]]'s oceans, as well as an administrative building and small barracks for the starport security forces. In addition to the standard communications and navigational arrays, there is a ring of large emitter domes on the walls surrounding the facility. Astute observers can see clouds of dull red several dozen metres from these emitters; swarms of hungry [[Crimson Locusts]].

Traffic control guides the Travellers' ship to a small landing platform near one of the hangars and a small group of security and the port authority administrator [[#Brufort Bureaucrat|Jundus]] come out to greet them and discuss the reason for their visit. While security looks like they are ready for a fight, [[#Brufort Bureaucrat|Jundus]] comes across as very congenial. He informs the Travellers of the current law on the planet and requests they leave any firearms on their vessel, although they are allowed to carry blades openly. A Traveller can attempt a Difficult (10+) Deception check (1Dx10 seconds, DEX) to conceal a small weapon on their person. If the Travellers tell him about their search for the _Radiant Maiden_ he shows concern and directs them to the [[Brufort#Office of the Regent|Office of the Regent]] in [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]] because 'all records of ship passage and landing are kept there'. He can provide the necessary documentation to request release of the information and will offer transport via a loaned air/raft if they do not have ground transportation available. If they ask about the emitters ringing the starport [[#Brufort Bureaucrat|Jundus]] warns them about the locusts and advises to always remain in areas protected by the devices. Any Travellers belonging to a species with the Heightened Senses trait for hearing can make a Routine (6+) Recon check (1D seconds, INT) to notice the subsonic drone of the emitters.

The guards are watchful of the Travellers as long as they remain at the starport and they are barred from getting too close to any of the other hangars, especially the large one. If a Traveller makes an Average (8+) Recon check (1D seconds, INT) while studying the large hangar they can make out a large ship inside through a brief opening in the hangar doors. While it is difficult to tell the class of the ship, it is in the process of being repainted and there are several security guards posted at the entrance to the fence surrounding the hangar. Administrator [[#Brufort Bureaucrat|Jundus]] will ignore or wave off any questions about the large hangar, citing a 'respect for the privacy of all our guests'. The guards will demand anyone approaching the hangar turn around and become hostile if pressed.

If the Travellers accept [[#Brufort Bureaucrat|Jundus]]' offer for a ride into the city, or if they have transport of their own, they set off down the roadway leading to [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]]. Like the starport, it is lined with emitter dishes and the Travellers see swarms of locusts emerge from the jungle as they pass by, drawn by movement. The road is flanked by three metre walls and as they drive the Travellers can make a Routine (6+) Recon or Investigate check (1D seconds, INT) to notice damage to the walls in places consistent with crashes. Some of the marks look recent and some of it looks extensive, like a vehicle was travelling at high speed. The road goes past the ocean the closer they get to the city and several large drilling rigs are seen in the waters.

When they arrive at [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]] they are let through a set of gates flanked by guard towers, both of which look like they are additions to the city's existing wall. The gates are closed as soon as the Travellers pass into the Seaside district and they are stopped by several guards who ask their business and offer to direct them to any location in the city. If the Travellers need to borrow an air/raft they are allowed to use it as long as they remain in [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]]. The guards suggest they check in at the [[Brufort#Office of the Regent|Office of the Regent]] in the [[Brufort#Regency|Regency]] district and any inquiries about [[#the Radiant Maiden]] are redirected to [[Regent Phirric|Phirric]].

The Travellers are free to explore [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]] as they see fit but as they move around the city there are several things that stand out. First are the many emitters around every district of the city and the angry clouds of locusts waiting outside the walls. Second is the presence of the [[#Pernach security agents]], especially in large public areas such as markets and public parks, as well as near industrial sites. There are also security cameras positioned on nearly every street corner, especially in the [[Brufort#Regency|Regency]] and [[Brufort#Seaside|Seaside]] districts. Third is the general mood of the populace; most keep their eyes down as they walk and everything seems muted. If the Travellers approach anyone, even just for pleasantries, most responses are curt. If security personnel are present many people will either keep interactions brief or ignore the Travellers entirely.

If the Travellers ask about [[#the Radiant Maiden]] or any offworlders who arrived two months ago, most of the population will not have any information to provide.  [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] worked to isolate [[#the Radiant Maiden|the Maiden]]'s crew and eliminated them a few days after arrival. If the Travellers focus their efforts near the gates at Seaside or in the [[Brufort#Regency|Regency]] district and use images of the crew provided by [[Sharurshid]], they can attempt a Difficult (10+) Investigate check (1D hours, INT). If successful they locate someone who noticed the crew exiting the gates on foot (if they are checking at Seaside) or witnessed them leaving the [[Brufort#Office of the Regent|Office of the Regent]] with an escort of security guards. If the check is successful with Effect 4+ the witness also noticed the crew seemed upset or fearful.

Although [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] has worked to eliminate the seedier elements of [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]], Travellers can also try to get information in the underbelly of the city. There are several rough and tumble bars in the Stacks and Seaside districts, and a few areas of the Neighbourhood are places where people are more open about their dislike of [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]]'s presence on the planet. A Traveller can attempt a Difficult (10+) Streetwise check (1D hours, INT) to try to get information from one of these sources. If the check is successful the Travellers can learn about [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] strong-arming the city into submission and the spate of disappearances of citizens who spoke out against them. They also hear about convenient 'malfunctions' of the emitters in areas where there has been opposition to the regent and [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]], and how the issues stop as soon as any budding insurrection ceases. If the check succeeds with Effect 3+, the Travellers are told the Last Refuge is a good place for those not happy with the situation in [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]]. With Effect 6+ they are also told about an old friend of the regent who arrived last year and how he seems to be the true power on [[Brufort]] despite him holding no title within the [[Imperium]].

> [!info]+ THE LARGE HANGAR
> If the Travellers press the issue and try to gain access to the large hangar, the security forces will become aggressive and attempt to capture them. There are 15 security guards stationed at the starport at all times and if needed they will contact forces in the city for reinforcement. Reinforcements of 20 additional security guards will arrive in 1Dx10 minutes once contacted. Sneaking into the hangar is possible but it will be difficult since security at the starport will be watching the Travellers like hawks as long as they are there. Any Traveller trying to sneak into the large hangar must make an Average (8+) DEX check to climb the fence and a Difficult (10+) Stealth check to cross into the hangar.
> 
> [[#The Radiant Maiden]] is in the hangar and about half of the ship has been repainted to cover the colouration and logos used by [[Sharurshid]]. There is also equipment on the ship used to help change a vessel's registry and erase the logs so [[#the Radiant Maiden|the Maiden]] will no longer be recognisable when finished. The crews making the changes work at night, so if the Travellers gain access during the day they will have free rein to explore the ship as long as starport personnel are not alerted to their presence. The crew quarters have been cleared but the cargo remains intact and the ship's logs have not been totally erased. An Average (8+) Electronics (computers) check (1Dx10 minutes, INT) can gain access to the logs and copy to another computer. If the Travellers encountered the scout ships on their journey to Brufort, the logs mention [[#the Radiant Maiden|the Maiden]] was attacked by a similar looking ship and suffered damage to its navigation that forced the vessel to land.

### TRAPPED ON BRUFORT

If the Travellers head to the [[Brufort#Office of the Regent|Office of the Regent]] to follow-up upon [[#Brufort Bureaucrat|Jundus]]' information, they are greeted by an older woman behind a window named [[#Brufort Bureaucrat|Mrs. Quail]] who presents as all business. She is terse and matter of fact in her conversation and she handles her job completely by the book. If they ask about [[#the Radiant Maiden]] , she will hand them an information request form and tell them it usually takes '7 to 10 days to process'. They can attempt to convince her to speed up the process with either a Difficult (10+) Admin (1D minutes, INT) or Diplomat check (1D minutes, SOC), reducing the number of days by the Effect of the result. She also informs them about a 'mandatory quarantine period' for all offworlders and that they will need to remain on planet for at least five days while their ship's hull is decontaminated to ensure it did not bring any foreign material or pathogens to the planet.

While they can attempt to argue this point, [[#Brufort Bureaucrat|Mrs. Quail]] will not budge and informs them that the policy comes from the regent himself. If the Travellers become belligerent or threatening to [[#Brufort Bureaucrat|Mrs. Quail]], she will notify security with a button at her feet and six security guards will arrive within 1D minutes. The Travellers may object to the quarantine, and the slow process to get information, but [[#Brufort Bureaucrat|Mrs. Quail]] is a bureaucrat and is simply following procedures instituted by the regent. She will provide more paperwork to file complaints and request an audience with the regent but again there are delays of multiple days for each.

These delays are intentional to allow [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] and [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] time to evaluate offworlders to determine if they are a threat or potential recruits. No matter how much the Travellers complain the delays will remain and may even be extended if [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] decides its needs more time to observe them. The local guards are issued photos of the Travellers taken by security cameras at the starport and in the [[Brufort#Office of the Regent|Office of the Regent]], and they will not be allowed to leave through the main gates unless given permission by [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] through [[Regent Phirric]]. If the Travellers prove to be troublemakers or resort to aggression, [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] will mark them as a threat and take measures to capture or kill them, if necessary. [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] and [[Regent Phirric]] want to maintain order in the city and do not want word of their alliance to get back to the [[Imperium]].  [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] has over 1000 guards within [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]] and they have well-stocked armouries to help deal with problems that arise.

> [!info]+ An Audience with the Regent
> [[Regent Phirric]] serves as a background character during this adventure to keep the focus on [[Alistair Humbolt|the Lost Duke]] but persistent Travellers may try to speak with him or the Referee may want to expand his role. As mentioned before extensive paperwork and the implacable [[#Brufort Bureaucrat|Mrs. Quail]] will make it exceedingly difficult to get an audience with the regent under normal circumstances but there are ways to locate [[Regent Phirric]] to bend his ear or seek his intervention. He keeps regular office hours at the [[Brufort#Office of the Regent|Office of the Regent]] although can only be seen with an appointment. He works from 8am in the morning until 6pm each weekday, arriving and departing in a luxury ground car and escorted by four [[#Pernach Security Guard]]s. His home in the northern end of [[Brufort#Regency|Regency]] has a three metre tall fence surrounding it, ringed with security cameras, and the main gate is staffed by one security guard at all times. In the middle of the week he holds a session with the ruling council at 2pm on the second floor conference room of the [[Brufort#Office of the Regent|Office of the Regent]] and this meeting usually lasts two hours. He is also known to dine at a restaurant in the [[Brufort#Regency|Regency]] called Mortavia's Grill with his wife Teisa the same evening as the council meeting. His guard contingent is always nearby when he is out in public, a recent precaution after the resistance raided a [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] armoury.
> 
> If approached when his guards are present, two of them will attempt to block the Travellers while the others escort him to safety. The guards will attack if the Travellers appear aggressive or if they do not back down. If confronted at his home [[Regent Phirric|Phirric]] will immediately try to alert [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] and 2D+5 guards will arrive within 1D+5 minutes from the local guard station. If the Travellers are able to approach [[Regent Phirric|Phirric]] when his guards are not present, he will do his best to appear attentive to their concerns. If asked about [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] or [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]], he will praise their work unless pressed with a Difficult (10+) Persuade check (INT). If this check is successful, he will talk of them as if they are a 'necessary measure' and refer to recent raider activity in the system and concerns about large corporate interests seeking to take over Brurfort's mining operations. He will do his best to appear a compassionate politician and try to convince the Travellers he will address their concerns and take the appropriate action but as soon as they depart will immediately notify [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] of what transpired. While [[Regent Phirric]] knows [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] is motivated by selfish interests, he is afraid of angering [[Alistair Humbolt|the Lost Duke]] and is concerned for his own public image if it comes out how much he has let [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] influence policy on [[Brufort]]. He is also smart enough to recognise his recent security detail is a tactic by [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] to underline who is really in charge of [[Brufort]].

# A REVOLTING SITUATION

Even if they do not take time to investigate or dig into the internal politics of [[Brufort]] the Travellers are able to pick up on simmering tensions within the populace. Most people appear to be on edge or pushed to the point of apathy and [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] security forces seem to be enjoying their position of authority on the planet. To illustrate this point, while the Travellers are making their way around the city they happen upon a young man who is staging a solitary protest about [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] and someone he calls [[Alistair Humbolt|the Lost Duke]]. He is shouting about how they took [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]] from the people and stole what was rightfully theirs. He is not gathering a crowd but instead people are either trying to ignore him or pointedly walking away. Before the Travellers can get close to him a squad of five security guards arrive and surround the man. He cries out 'this is what I am talking about', before they grab and haul him to a security car and push him inside.

The Travellers can attempt to intervene but if they move to do so or are otherwise focused on the incident an elderly woman calls out to them to get their attention. She warns them about interfering with [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]]'s men and if they have not been told about the Last Refuge, she will direct them there, saying it is friendly to 'offworlders and those not happy with the state of things here'. If pressed for more information she will direct them to speak to the owner of the hostel because 'she can better answer your questions'. The woman is sympathetic to the burgeoning resistance in [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]] and if she sees the Travellers willing to take action she will try to get them to meet with members of the group.

If the Travellers try to stop the security guards from taking the man, one of the guards will warn them away and tell them 'not to interfere with [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] business.' If the Travellers persist or become aggressive, four of the guards will fight back and the fifth will try to radio for backup. A group of 10 more guards will arrive in three ground cars within 1D minutes once the call goes out. They will try to capture the Travellers, if possible, but they will resort to lethal force, if necessary. If the Travellers attempt to flee the conflict the guards will not immediately pursue and will instead alert the local security station to the incident. [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] will send six squads of four guards each to patrol the district in ground cars, using descriptions provided of the Travellers. If the Travellers are able to protect the man or rescue him from the guards, they learn he is a local miner named Paul Ennis who recently had his shares bought out by [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]]. This was his personal protest and he has no association with the local resistance, however if the Travellers befriend him he may be inclined to help if they join the group.

![[LstDuke-134.jpg]]

### HOSTEL ENVIRONMENT

While stuck on [[Brufort]] the Travellers will need a place to stay and by this point they have received the suggestion to check out a hostel called the [[Brufort#Last Refuge|Last Refuge]] in [[Brufort#the Neighbourhood|the Neighbourhood]] district.

While [[Danease Garber|Danease]] presents as a friendly host, in truth she is part of a local resistance movement, which has been growing since the arrival of [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]]. She uses her connections within [[Brufort#the Neighbourhood|the Neighbourhood]] to keep tabs on the activities of the security forces and offers refuge to those affected by [[Alistair Humbolt|the Lost Duke]]'s forces. [[Danease Garber|Danease]] also has set herself up as someone willing to host offworlders in [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]] on business. She takes the time to evaluate Travellers passing through as potential allies in the struggle against [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] or as a means of getting word off planet to the [[Imperium]] ] since [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]]'s people closely monitor all correspondence. She knows about [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] and his influence on [[Regent Phirric|the regent]] and also has her suspicions that there is more to him than meets the eye but the resistance does not know he is a Humbolt. Up to this point she has also been clever enough to mask her role within the resistance but [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]]'s chief of security, [[Anton Craix]], keeps an eye on her hostel to monitor traffic from off planet.

If the Travellers ask her about the _Radiant Maiden_ , or if they talk about the current state of [[Brufort]] and [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]], [[Danease Garber|Danease]] will try to gauge their willingness to become involved with the resistance. She knows the resistance needs all the help it can get, especially as they plan their first overt action against [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]]; she will ask the Travellers probing questions and give information about the current state of [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]] if they inquire. [[Danease Garber|Danease]] knows about [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] being brought in by the regent due to his association with [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] and has seen the increase in their influence over the city and mining operations. She also knows [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] uses its control over the emitters to keep the city under their thumb, and can tell the Travellers of several occasions where [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] engineered 'malfunctions' to allow [[Crimson Locusts]] into areas where the population was objecting to a new law or restriction. She also knows what happened to [[#the Radiant Maiden]] and its crew but is not sure if the ship is still at the starport since she, like most of the population, is not allowed to go there.

If the Travellers seem sympathetic to the plight of [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]], or if they ask how they can help, [[Danease Garber|Danease]] will trust them with her role in the resistance as recruiter and informant. At this point the resistance has only worked on gathering information on [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]], [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] and the means they use to control the colony. They were also recently able to raid one of the [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] armouries to acquire arms and armour. They accomplished this by breaching the armoury's security, thanks to a computer expert named [[#Orion]], and this has emboldened the group into planning more overt action against their oppressors. [[Danease Garber|Danease]] asks the Travellers to help them with their plans and assures them if they succeed the Travellers will be able to leave [[Brufort]]. She also tells them the longer they stay the less likely it is that they will survive and offers to take them to [[#Yusef Masih|the lone survivor]] of [[#the Radiant Maiden]] so he can tell them his tale. If the Travellers are reluctant to join, she will ask for any help they can provide even if they are unwilling to risk their safety and at least ask for them to be silent about the resistance.

### THE MAIDEN'S SURVIVOR

If the Travellers agree to accompany [[Danease Garber|Danease]] to meet the [[#Yusef Masih|survivor]] of [[#the Radiant Maiden|the Maiden]] , she takes them to the edge of [[Brufort#The Neighbourhood]] to an old mine from [[Brufort]]'s earliest days. The location is largely abandoned but it now serves as a hideaway for those trying to escape [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] and for members of the small resistance movement. The current leader of the group, an [[Aslan]] who goes by [[#Ktyah]], is present as well as the computer expert [[#Orion]]. [[#Ktyah]] puts his faith in [[Danease Garber|Danease]]'s judgement with regards to the Travellers but is wary of them until they prove their worth. [[#Orion]] works continuously on his computer as well as other pieces of communications gear and seems distracted and mildly annoyed at the interruption if the Travellers try to speak to him. [[Danease Garber|Danease]] takes them back to a makeshift apartment deep in the old mine where a young man sits on a simple bed. He is startled at their approach and only seems reassured when he sees [[Danease Garber|Danease]]. She introduces him as [[#Yusef Masih]], [[#the Radiant Maiden]]'s engineer, and with her coaxing he tells them his story.

[[#Yusef Masih|Yusef]] tells them about [[#the Radiant Maiden|the Maiden]]'s encounter with the supposed pirate ship when they arrived in the system and having to land after their navigation array was damaged. Like the Travellers, his crew was sent into [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]] to speak with the [[Brufort#Office of the Regent|Office of the Regent]] and they were given the same story about a period of quarantine. His captain warned them early on about the authoritarian undercurrent and she immediately began looking for a way for them to get back to the ship. Unfortunately, they spoke to the wrong person and [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]]ch Solutions|Pernach]] soon arrived to bring them to an 'audience with the regent'. [[#Yusef Masih|Yusef]] was ordered to stay behind at the Last Refuge but he followed the security forces and witnessed his crew being forced out of an isolated access gate in the wall around the Stacks at gunpoint. [[#Yusef Masih|Yusef]] has difficulty finishing his story, only muttering about 'their screams' as swarms of bloodthirsty locusts descended on his former crew. There is a flash of anger as he relates that the guards took bets on how long his crewmates would survive.

If the Travellers are still having doubts about helping the resistance, [[Danease Garber|Danease]] will ask them to consider what happened to [[#the Radiant Maiden|the Maiden]]'s crew and will point out if they have been asking about the ship they might be destined for the same fate. [[#Yusef Masih|Yusef]] just wants to get back to his family and is willing to help, and will ask the Travellers for their aid if they seem reluctant. [[Danease Garber|Danease]] offers the Travellers space in the mines if they are concerned about their safety or they can return to the Last Refuge. If they are agreeable, [[Danease Garber|Danease]] will take them back to [[#Ktyah]] and begin discussing plans to help take back [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]].

> [!info] A MATTER OF TRUST+
>
> As mentioned earlier the people of [[Brufort]] are slow to trust outsiders and this is especially true of [[#Ktyah]]. As the leader of the resistance he fears someone alerting [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] about their operations and plans. Even if [[Danease Garber|Danease]] vouches for the Travellers he will be wary of them and ask for a test of their loyalty if they wish to be part of the resistance. While [[#Ktyah]] will not reveal the group's plans, he will ask for assistance in acquiring a security key fob from [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] personnel in the Seaside district. While he will not go into detail about the reason he needs it, [[#Ktyah]] will tell them it is 'vital' that the group has one. He does not give them any specific strategy, only stressing the need for discretion so the Travellers do not draw unwanted attention to the resistance. If they refuse to participate it will not prevent the resistance from allowing the Travellers to help but [[#Ktyah]] will be reluctant to give them all but the most minimal information for any tasks they are involved in.
>
> If the Travellers do agree, they will be given latitude in determining how to acquire the key fob. [[#Pernach Security Guard]]s patrol the Seaside area on foot in teams of two during the day and two security ground cars with two guards drive around the district throughout the day. In the evening there are four patrol cars on duty and at night there are three cars. There are two security stations at the docks and near the Seaside infrasound transmitter hub respectively and each station has 12 guards present at all times to provide backup and support. [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] personnel work eight hour shifts and many go to local bars to unwind after their shifts.
>
> The key fobs are kept on retractable lanyards attached to their belts and sneaky Travellers can attempt to pickpocket one from an unsuspecting guard with a successful Difficult (10+) Stealth check (1D seconds, DEX). If the guard is distracted, asleep or intoxicated, the difficulty of this check is lowered to Routine (6+). Travellers can also try to take one of the key fobs by force and, unless they are able to catch a patrol unawares, one of the guards will attempt to call for back-up if attacked. Because [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] hired many of its guards on [[Brufort]] from less than reputable sources, a missing patrol will not be investigated for 1Dx5 hours unless there was a witness to the attack. Guards have been known to hit bars early, engage in illegal activities during their shift or simply ignore their duties. If [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] is aware of a patrol being attacked, or that one of the key fobs is missing, they will have all personnel from the district report to one of the security stations to have their fob codes changed, rendering any stolen ones useless.

### THE LOST DUKE'S OFFER

![[LstDuke-151.jpg]]

If the Travellers go to the [[Brufort#Office of the Regent|Office of the Regent]] they will be tagged by [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]]'s people and if they are asking around about the _Maiden_ he will send Security Chief [[Anton Craix]] to make an invitation to meet at [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]]'s offices in Regency. This can occur shortly after they leave the regent's office, while they are exploring the city or anytime the Travellers are at the Last Refuge. While [[Anton Craix|Craix]] is a no-nonsense type, he does his best to present the invitation as an informal meeting and even notes there will be 'light refreshments'. Unfortunately, his casual demeanour is marred by the presence of six security guards who offer to escort the Travellers to the meeting. While [[Anton Craix|Craix]] does his best to be non-threatening, his guards give the impression that the meeting is not optional. If the Travellers decline the offer, [[Anton Craix|Craix]]'s men will start to move in but he will stop them and leave without incident with a cryptic 'I hope you stay safe and well while you are here'. The refusal will enrage [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] and he will decide the Travellers are potential threats and order them eliminated.

If they accept, [[Anton Craix|Craix]] and his men take them back to [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]]'s offices and they are brought into a well- appointed conference room where a small repast is set out on a long, exotic wood table. [[Anton Craix|Craix]] and two of the guards take position near the only door and a few minutes later [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] walks in and greets the Travellers before asking them to take a seat. He engages in brief, casual conversation but soon gets down to business, asking them why they are on [[Brufort]] and their interest in [[#the Radiant Maiden]] if they bring it up or talked to any of his people about the ship. He assures them he will do everything in his power to help find information on the ship, although if the Travellers make an Average (8+) INT check they will note his statement seems insincere.

He also asks for their assistance with something while they are on planet, informing them about trouble he has had with local insurgents who seek to undermine the safety and security of [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]]. Since they are outsiders, [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] tells them they will have an easier time infiltrating this group and offers a 'substantial reward' if they can find useful information. He offers Cr20000 and a successful opposed Broker check (1D minutes, INT) can raise this to Cr30000. [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] views this as a test of the Travellers' potential loyalty and if they decline or seem reluctant, he will mentally mark them as threats and order [[Anton Craix|Craix]] to eliminate them as soon as they leave.

During the meeting the Travellers can make an Average (8+) Investigate or Recon check (1D seconds, INT). If successful they notice a signet ring [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] is wearing on his right hand; it has a crest made up of a stylised letter H in the middle of a sunburst and an Average (8+) Admin check (1D seconds, EDU) will reveal this as the family crest of the Humbolt family. If [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] is asked about it, he covers up his hand and immediately ends the meeting, asking the guards to escort the Travellers out of the building. If the Travellers become hostile or confrontational [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] will do his best to exit the room and [[Anton Craix|Craix]] will call for more guards to detain or escort them out of the building.

If the Travellers are marked as a threat, [[Anton Craix|Craix]] will order his men to take them to the access gate in the Stacks just like the crew of [[#the Radiant Maiden|the Maiden]]. [[Anton Craix|Craix]] and six of his men will offer to transport them back to a place of their choosing in a ground van and if the Travellers refuse, the offer will be made again at gunpoint. If the Travellers refuse to meet with [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]], or they are deemed a threat at any other point during the adventure, [[Anton Craix|Craix]] will send a number of guards equal to the number of Travellers plus two to take them into custody. If the Travellers are captured or forced to come along, they will be taken to a small metal access door behind one of the large processing plants in the Stacks. Unless they resist they will be escorted out of the door and left in the jungles outside before the guards head back inside and close the door. Within 1D minutes the closest emitter will be turned off and 1Dx10 seconds later 1D+2 swarms of [[Crimson Locusts]] will attack them. As long as the Travellers remain outside the walls 1D additional swarms of locusts will arrive every 1D minutes until they are dead or manage to get back into an area covered by emitters. Active emitters broadcast infrasound to 500 metres outside the walls and the area within 1,000 metres of either side of the door will remain inactive for 1D hours after the Travellers are forced out.

![[LstDuke-156.jpg|200]]

> [!info]+ Taking Sides ^takingsides
>
> If the Travellers have been in contact with both factions in the struggle for control over Brufort, they have a decision to make. This adventure assumes the Travellers will take sides with the resistance to help free [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]] and themselves but it is not the only choice available. If the Travellers decide to accept [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]]'s offer, they may end up working for [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] against the resistance. If this happens, [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] will ask them to infiltrate the group, uncover their plans and either alert [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] so they can arrest the resistance members or work to sabotage those plans from within. The Referee can use the next section as written but alter things as needed if the Travellers follow through with betraying the resistance. If the Travellers are successful in helping the Lost Duke, they will be offered work by [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] in his plans for [[Brufort]] and beyond.
>
> It is also possible the Travellers will go their own way and not get involved with the power struggles on [[Brufort]]. They may seek to find another means to get back to their ship, although this will be difficult if they are trapped in [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]]. Security will be keeping a close eye on them and will not allow them back to the starport without [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]]'s approval; if they seem to be a threat to [[Alistair Humbolt|the Lost Duke]], he will have them killed. While he avoids direct action by his people, [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] could use the pretence of allowing the Travellers to head back to the [[Brufort#starport|starport]] and then shut off the infrasound emitters along the road so hundreds of swarms of [[Crimson Locusts]] descend upon them.
>
> Inventive and resourceful Travellers can come up with some way to get back to the [[Brufort#Starport|starport]], possibly using stolen environment suits from one of the local processing plants or stealing a sealed vehicle to travel through the jungles. If they spoke with [[#Yusef Masih|Yusef]] they will also know there is an access door out of the city in [[Brufort#the Stacks]], although it leads into the jungles. If they manage to get back to the starport, they will still need to deal with the guards there. The Travellers' ship has been moved inside one of the small hangars, which is locked by the starport staff. It can be unlocked with a Difficult (10+) Mechanic check (1Dx10 seconds, DEX) or a key can be obtained if the Travellers gain access to the control tower.

# FREEING BRUFORT

If the Travellers decide to help the resistance, they will take part in devising and implementing a plan to take control of the infrasound emitters to wrest control of them away from [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] and [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]]. [[#Ktyah]] believes this will give them a potent way to counter the Lost Duke's influence on [[Brufort]] and may even serve as a way to drive him and [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] off the planet entirely. [[Danease Garber|Danease]] will put a call out for all able members of the group to gather in the old mines and this rallies 30 people willing to risk their freedom and possibly their lives to help [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]]. Once everyone is gathered [[#Ktyah]] explains [[#Orion]] has devised a way to hack into the control system for the emitters so the resistance will be able to turn them on or off just as [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] is able to do. [[#Orion]] believes if he can gain access to one of the emitter control hubs in the city he will be able to gain access to the system and create a backdoor he can use to access them remotely if [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] tries to regain control. Unfortunately, because the emitters are part of a closed system, [[#Orion]] will need to be physically present at one of the hubs to insert his programme.

[[#Ktyah]]'s plan is to have one team accompany [[#Orion]] to the hub in Seaside to gain entry and protect him while he works and for several smaller teams to create distractions throughout the city to draw away [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]]'s security forces. [[#Orion]] was able to access the city's records to get the original architectural plans for the hub, so they have the general layout of the building. The resistance has also mapped all of the guard posts within the city and members have made a time table of patrol patterns and shifts of [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]]'s security forces. [[Danease Garber|Danease]] and [[#Ktyah]] will ask the Travellers if they would like to help with the attack on the hub, or help distract the security forces, and are open to suggestions about strategies for the operation. [[#Ktyah]] is more aggressive in his approaches, favouring direct assaults on [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] forces and the hub despite the resistance being outnumbered. [[Danease Garber|Danease]] would prefer a less risky approach and encourages the Travellers to provide input or discuss skills and experience they could bring to bear.

In addition to the building plans and guard patterns, the resistance also has weapons and munitions they recently stole from one of [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]]'s armouries. They also have stores of more mundane items collected in the mines to help with field operations. If the Travellers require gear for their part in the mission, they can choose from the following available arms and equipment:

- Weapons: Blades x2, Stunsticks x3, Body Pistols x2, Autopistols x2, Advanced Combat Rifle, TL9 Laser Pistols x3, TL9 Laser Carbine, Frag Grenade, Smoke Grenades x3, Stun Grenades x2
- Armour: TL10 Cloth x2, TL8 Flak Jackets x3, Mesh x4, TL10 Combat Armour
- Equipment: TL8 Mobile Comms x10, TL10 Portable Computer, TL8 Medikits x3, Electronics Toolkit, Mechanical Toolkit, Pernach Security Guard Uniforms x4

[[#Ktyah]] wants to enact their plan within a day of the Travellers being brought into the group, warning them their time is limited, especially if [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] has marked them as a threat. While he is willing to entertain suggestions, anything requiring them to wait will fall on deaf ears. [[#Ktyah]] believes [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] is only growing stronger in their influence and in time [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] will have a controlling interest in the mines, stripping what little power the people have over the fate of their world. If the Travellers insist on a more cautious approach, or if it seems they are able to gain influence on the resistance thanks to use of skills like Leadership or Persuade, [[#Ktyah]] will grow impatient and leave with a small group of eight followers to enact his own plans. [[Danease Garber|Danease]] will do her best to calm him for his own sake and because his brashness might disrupt other plans and the Travellers can help with a Very Difficult (12+) Diplomat or Persuade check (SOC). Arguments emphasising how rash actions might give [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] the upper hand will lower the difficulty of this check to Difficult (10+). If the check is successful [[#Ktyah]] will reluctantly hold off moving on his own but his annoyance and impatience will be evident until the resistance takes action.

### TAKING THE EMITTERS

[[#Ktyah]] will send at least 25 of the available resistance members in small groups of four or five to try to draw away [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]]'s forces from Seaside, delaying response times once the other team tries to take over the hub.

If the Travellers opt to help with keeping the [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] forces distracted, they have latitude in how they want to accomplish this goal. As witnessed previously, speaking out publicly against [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] is a good way to gain the ire of the security forces and any overt destructive act against a municipal building, processing plant or patrol will pull a large number of security guards towards the site of an attack. Causing trouble at the [[Brufort#Office of the Regent|Office of the Regent]] or the home of [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] will also divert a large number of [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]]'s forces. The Travellers are encouraged to be creative if they choose this route to help the resistance's plan. If the Referee deems their plan good enough to work as a distraction, it will allow the resistance team attacking the hub to gain access as planned.

![[LstDuke-169.jpg|100]]
[[LstDuke-169.jpg|Building Maps]]

If the Travellers are on the team trying to gain control of the emitter hub, they will be accompanied by [[#Ktyah]], [[#Orion]] and a reluctant [[#Yusef Masih|Yusef]]. They can study the surrounding area as well as the building plans to devise a plan for the assault. The hub in [[Brufort#Seaside|Seaside]] is a two storey plascrete building with few windows and only two entrances; one main entrance along the street and a service entrance at the rear. The most notable features on the top of the building is a large array of communications antenna and dishes used to broadcast to the infrasound emitters and there is a small access hatch on the roof. The main door is locked and can be opened using a special key fob [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] personnel in [[Brufort#Seaside|Seaside]] carry or by [[#Pernach Security Guard|guards]] at the security desk inside. The rear door and the roof hatch are both kept locked and can be opened with the same key needed for the main door or with a Difficult (10+) Mechanic check (1Dx10 seconds, DEX).

The interior of the building is spartan and functional, with a guard post inside the main door manned by two security guards at all times. These guards monitor security cameras at the main and rear doors as well as local CCTV cameras for a two-block radius around the building. The first floor also contains a small break room, two offices and a lavatory. The second floor has a room for the massive servers to operate the emitters, another office and the control room for the hub. Security guards are on duty in the building with one doing a routine patrol of the hallways every 15 minutes and two more stationed in the control room. A technician is also on duty in the control room but they are a non- combatant and will attempt to hide or flee the building if a fight breaks out.

The Travellers will be assigned tasks based on their skill set and [[#Ktyah]] and [[#Orion]] will accompany them unless they have a more capable computer expert who can insert the hack into the system. The Travellers can attempt to gain access to the building through guile, brute force or stealth, and each approach has its own challenges. The Travellers can use the security uniforms the resistance has or get some more of their own and try to fool the guards with a Difficult (10+) Deception check (1D minutes, INT). The Referee can modify the difficulty of this check based on whatever story the Travellers come up with and if successful they can gain access to the main doors. Without a disguise or credentials, it will be difficult for the Travellers to simply walk up to the building without being noticed but they can attempt a Very Difficult (12+) Stealth check (1D minutes, DEX) to get close enough to the building to reach one of the entrances. A direct assault is possible but the Travellers will need to find a way inside the building and this response will give the guards inside time to call for assistance. The distractions the other resistance members cause will delay this response with 12 security guards arriving within 1Dx10 minutes after the alert is sounded.

> [!info] The Red Death
> When [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] becomes aware of an attack by the resistance, be it the assault on the hub or the distracting actions, he will use his control over the infrasound emitters. He will attempt to target the areas where resistance members are causing disruption but if he is aware of the attempt to gain control of the hub, he will drop the infrasound bubble around the region entirely. This will cause pandemonium in the city as both the regular populace and [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]]'s own people scramble to find shelter from swarms of [[Crimson Locusts]]. If the Travellers are outside when this happens 1D+2 swarms of locusts will arrive within 1Dx10 seconds of the bubble being dropped and 1D more swarms will arrive every 1D minutes until the infrasound bubble is restored or the locusts have no more victims.
> ![[LstDuke-176.jpg]]
> If they are in the process of trying to take the hub, this can act as motivation for them to gain control over the emitters as soon as possible. If the Travellers are part of the distraction teams, the area where they are operating will be affected by [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]]'s actions and they will need to try to survive until the resistance gains control of the hub, a process that takes 1Dx10 minutes from when the locust attacks start. If the resistance gains control of the emitters they can restore the infrasound bubble within 1D minutes in any area where it was shut down.

If the Travellers are able to reach either the server or control room on the second floor, they can begin hacking into the computers controlling the emitters. If [[#Orion]] is with them, he gets started immediately but the process of breaching security and uploading the hack will take 1Dx10 minutes. If one of the Travellers is in charge of hacking the system it requires a Difficult (10+) Electronics (computers) check (1Dx10 minutes, INT). If there is still security in the building who are aware of the intrusion, or if additional [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] forces are inbound, the rest of the Travellers will need to keep the hacker safe until they are finished. If the virus is successfully uploaded, whoever is doing the hacking will gain immediate control of the emitters all over [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]] and the hack installs a backdoor allowing access even if they are not present in the hub.

### TURNING THE TABLES

If the resistance is able to gain control over the hub, and the hack is inserted into the system, they will have the same ability [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] wielded over the infrasound protective bubbles all over [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]]. The remaining members of the resistance attack will gather back at their base in the old mines to discuss the next step of their plans. If [[#Ktyah]] is still alive, he and some of the more militant members of the group will immediately talk about shutting down the emitters around the [[Brufort#Office of the Regent|Office of the Regent]], [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]]'s offices and the location of [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]]'s estate. Even if he did not survive there will be a significant faction within the resistance who support the idea. [[Danease Garber|Danease]] will object to this course of action if she is present, citing the fact that the regent and [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] both employ innocent people within their staff. The Travellers can voice their opinions as well but ultimately without a compelling argument the majority of the resistance will agree with [[#Ktyah]] and decide it is for the greater good of [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]]. [[#Ktyah]] will issue a warning via the city's communications systems to warn everyone in the affected areas to go indoors and he will let the personnel of [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] and the Lost Duke know their districts will continue to be swarmed with the locusts until they leave Brufort. If the Travellers object or do not want to be part of [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]]' affairs, [[#Ktyah]] will thank them for their service and allow them and Yusef to depart the planet with [[#the Radiant Maiden]]. If asked, [[#Ktyah]] will drop the infrasound bubble around the starport to help take care of security personnel there and ensure safe passage off planet.

If control of the emitters is taken from him, [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] will panic and use a shuttle at his estate to get out of [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]] as soon as possible. He will rendezvous with one of the scout ships patrolling the system to take him back to his great uncle. If he is alive, Security Chief [[Anton Craix|Craix]] will begin withdrawing his core people from the planet fearing an uprising by the people once word of their manipulation of the emitters comes out. [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] will do its best to cover up their role in [[Brufort]] and blame it on 'rogue actors' within the company who have since been removed. If [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] is aware of the Travellers' involvement with the resistance he will become an Enemy and he and [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] can serve as foils during the future adventures.

With [[Alistair Humbolt|the Lost Duke]] and [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] gone [[Brufort]] will begin to heal from the damage caused by [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] and his people. [[Regent Phirric]] will be removed from power and Justis Rother of the [[Brufort#Brufort Mining Group|Brufort Mining Group]] will be made the new regent. He will take measures to establish a new local security force to help protect the planet and if [[#Ktyah]] survived the ordeal he will be made head of security. If the Traveller's role in the freeing of the planet is known, they will find [[Brufort]] to be a safe refuge and hailed as folk heroes for their actions. As long as the Travellers maintain a good relationship with the people of [[Brufort]], they will always be able to find work with the mining companies transporting ore and will get preferential rates on supplies.

If the Travellers fail to take the hub or do not succeed in their distracting actions, [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] will capture many members of the resistance. [[Danease Garber|Danease]] remained behind and will be able to hide any survivors in the abandoned mine system but it is only a matter of time before [[Anton Craix|Craix]] is able to get information out of one of the prisoners. [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] will sweep the city looking for any remaining members of the resistance, which includes any Travellers who participated. The Travellers can use [[#^takingsides|various strategies]]  to escape the city and get back to their ship, or they can try to appeal to [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] and get back into his good graces, but failing to take the emitters will make things more desperate for the resistance and the Travellers.

> [!info] Taking Back the Transmitters
> 
> If Security Chief [[Anton Craix|Craix]] has survived to this point, he may try to take action to get back control of the infrasound emitters from the resistance. If the Referee wants to use this option, [[Anton Craix|Craix]] will have learned the location of the resistance's base of operations after interrogating a prisoner captured from one of the groups sent out to cause a distraction. He will mount an attack on the base to regain the infrasound systems, using whatever guards he can muster in the chaos after the resistance attack on the hub. He will be able to gather 2D+10 security guards and will outfit himself and four of his men with [[#Heavy Assault]] gear. [[Anton Craix|Craix]] is planning a full frontal assault on the resistance with the goal of capturing or killing anyone he can find and recovering any computer equipment in the base.
> 
> Of the 30 resistance members involved in the attack and diversions, only 12 are able to return to the base. The remainder are either being treated for injuries, were killed or captured, or hiding out at other locations. They will have any remaining gear leftover from the list on page 27. The resistance will do their best to defend their base and protect [[#Orion]] (if he survived) and the computer controlling the infrasound system. They know the old mine tunnels around their base well and will attempt to funnel members out and around the [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] forces, if possible.
> 
> Referees should note this option could be very dangerous for the Travellers and should only use it if they want to add a dramatic 'final battle' to the adventure. [[Anton Craix|Craix]] and his men are well-armed and will most likely outnumber and outgun the Travellers and resistance members. The [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] forces will fight until they have lost at least half of their number and then will make a tactical retreat and use any remaining grenades to collapse the mine tunnels to trap remaining resistance members. If [[#Orion]] is captured or his computer is taken by [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]], the Travellers may need to take action to get it back before [[Alistair Humbolt|Alistair]] once again gains control of the emitters.

Ktyah was part of a storied and respected family but when he was young his father made improper advances on someone else's mate. His father was challenged to a duel and when Ktyah stepped in the rival slashed the young Aslan's face, giving him a prominent scar on his snout and lips. His father was disgraced for allowing his son to step in and ashamed at Ktyah's boldness, so the boy was stripped of titles and sent to live with distant relatives offworld. Ktyah's shame turned into anger at the injustice of this and it seethed in him as he grew into an adult.

In time he left his relations and looked for a place in the galaxy of his own, eventually settling on [[Brufort]] when a friend told him of the opportunities there. Ktyah enjoyed the hard work in the mines and his dedication helped him build a decent number of shares in the business. He viewed his co-workers as his new clan and grew very protective of his adoptive home. When [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] arrived Ktyah was immediately suspicious of their intentions and it did not take long for his suspicions to be confirmed. Again, his anger began to surface, directed towards the would-be usurpers of [[Brufort]]. He became the de facto leader of the underground resistance movement when he spoke out at a gathering of like-minded citizens and is eager to take the fight to [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]].

Phillip Mallis, better known by the handle Orion, was hired two years ago by the [[Brufort#Brufort Mining Group|Brufort Mining Group]] to help with their computer systems and service advanced mining equipment. He was considered a prodigy by those who recommended him but they were not aware that Orion's true passion was hacking. He had an affinity for computers from a young age and in his teens was caught breaking into corporate systems because he wanted to see if he could do it. While his work at the mining group is completely legitimate, he still pursues his passion in his spare time. He hacked into [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]]'s systems on a lark and discovered their use of the infrasound emitters by accident. This set him on a path to becoming involved with the resistance.

Yusef Masih is native to the planet [[Tuwyak]] and had worked as an engineer on several ships before entering into a contract with [[Sharurshid]] to serve on [[#the Radiant Maiden]]. He enjoyed his work there and had a good rapport with Captain Redfort and her crew, and despite him only having been on a few missions with them they viewed Yusef as one of their family.

Unfortunately, his time on [[#the Radiant Maiden|the Maiden]] was cut short when they were diverted to [[Brufort]] and the death of his crewmates still haunts him. Yusef was once confident to the point of cockiness but now his nerves are frayed and he needs the support of the resistance members who took him in. While there is an ember of rage in his heart towards [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]], Yusef is still too traumatised to do much without prompting. Deep down his only desire is to get off of [[Brufort]] so he can leave the painful memories he has behind.

A typical member of the resistance movement on [[Brufort]], these are ordinary citizens who have grown tired of [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]]'s growing domination of their planet. They are all natives who work for local businesses or for one of the mining companies and most have a personal reason for why they became involved with the movement. While they are determined to free their world, most have no formal combat training and are reliant on others with more experience to direct them in battle.

Like any other planet, [[Brufort]] runs thanks to the diligent work of overworked and underappreciated bureaucrats who handle the day-to-day operations that keep communities running. The Travellers may encounter different bureaucrats during the adventure but the two they will most likely deal with are the port authority administrator Jundus and Mrs Quail, the front desk administrator of the [[Brufort#Office of the Regent|Office of the Regent]]. The Referee can use the entry here for either of them and any other administrative personnel the Travellers encounter.

The typical [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] security guard in [[Brufort#Caelestis]] is a hired thug or ex-military mercenary employed by the company to help keep the peace and further [[Alistair Humbolt|the Lost Duke]]'s ambitions. While many come from off planet, there are a growing number of locals who have thrown in with [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] because of a desire for power or out of fear of reprisal. The listed equipment is typical for security guards found throughout the city and if needed they can access the following for specific encounters.

#### Crowd Control

Shotgun (4D, Bulky), Stun Grenades x2 (3D, Blast 9, Stun)

#### Heavy Assault

Advanced Combat Rifle (3D, Auto 3, Scope), Frag Grenades x2 (5D, Blast 9), Combat Armour (+13)
