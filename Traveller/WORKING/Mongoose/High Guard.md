###### INTRODUCTION

in an ocean of vacuum. Such a society must control that ocean.
Its instrument is the Navy. Traveller assumes a remote centralized
government (referred to in this volume as the Imperium) possessed
of great industrial and technological might; but due to the sheer
distances and travel times involved within its star–spanning realm,
the Imperium is unable to be everywhere at once. As a result, the
Imperium allows a large degree of autonomy to its subject worlds,
calling only for some respect for its overall policies, and for a united
front against outside pressures.

To monitor the space lanes, the Imperium maintains a Navy. Because
these forces can never be everywhere at once, local provinces
(subsectors) also maintain navies, as do individual worlds. This
three tiered structure of Imperial, subsector, and planetary navies
produces a flexible system for patrolling space, while putting the
limited resources of the Imperium to best use. High Guard deals
with the navies of the Imperium, of subsectors, and of worlds.

The sheer size of the Imperium precludes the navy from concentrating
its forces in one place – if war broke out on one border of the
Imperium, it would be months before news reached the capital, and
long months more before the navy could respond. Instead, there are
one or more Imperial fleets for each sector, named for that sector.
The Imperial navy is the tool of diplomacy and conquest as needs
dictate, the Emperor’s own sabre.

The Imperial Navy has the largest and most powerful vessels in
space – dreadnoughts, battle tenders and other mighty warships.

#### SUBSECTOR NAVIES

Each subsector maintains its own fleet of ships, composed normally
of cruisers, escorts, frigates and medium–sized ships. Subsector
navies are primarily responsible for defence, patrol of the spaceways
and safeguarding trade and commerce across the sector. In wartime,
each subsector is required to put a fraction of its ships at the disposal
of the Imperial Navy to act as reserves and reinforcements.

#### PLANETARY NAVIES

Planetary navies are responsible solely for the defence of their
home system, or a handful of related systems held by the same
duke. At minimum, the planetary navy protects the space up to the
main world’s jump limit, but in most systems, it will have bases in
orbit of the main world and the gas giant, as well as a presence at
any inhabited worlds or asteroid belts. Planetary navies tend to be
eccentric at best – officers are often retired or cashiered command
staff from the subsector navy, poorly educated locals using out–of–
date tactics, and third or fourth sons of noblemen. The equipment
is equally eclectic – a combination of local designs, antiques and
monitors.

## IINTRODUCTIONNTRODUCTION

Welcome to _High Guard_.

This book is concerned with the navy: its people and its ships. Just
as the seafarers of old were intrinsically linked with the vessels they
sailed – be they tall–masted sailing ships or nuclear–powered aircraft
carriers – so too are the naval personnel of the Imperium. The navy’s
purpose is to safeguard the Imperium’s interests at the system and
interstellar levels; High Guard details this role in three ways:

- Expanded character creation. High Guard takes the basics of
    generating a naval character and vastly expands the system
    to allow characters to specialize across various disciplines
    reflecting the navy’s structure. As characters progress through
    this expanded character generation system, they will become
    equipped with skills and life experiences that truly reflect the
    rigours of a naval career.
- Expanded ship construction. Using the core starship
    construction rules, High Guard offers greater depth for starship
    design with more options, larger hulls, more powerful weapons,
    and a deeper level of complexity to allow the construction of
    ships ranging from small, system–confined vessels up to the
    immense Capital Ships – fighting vessels displacing many
    thousands of tons and equipped with the most advanced
    weaponry and defensive capabilities.
- Expanded space combat. With more options and more powerful
    weapons, High Guard reflects on space combat and provides
    a more detailed system allowing Referees to plan epic space
    battles (from fighter dogfights up to the clash of heavily armed
    Capital Battleships) and for characters to take part in them.

High Guard is organised into the following chapters.

Chapter One: Naval Characters
Chapter Two: Expanded Ship Construction
Chapter Three Small Craft Design
Chapter Four: Capital Ship Design
Chapter Five: Expanded Space Combat
Chapter Six: Sample Small Craft
Chapter Seven: Sample Capital Ships
Chapter Eight: Naval Adventures

#### THE IMPERIAL NAVY

The force that rules the space between the stars controls both
transportation and communication, and as a result, controls all
intercourse between worlds. The instrument of such control is the
Navy.

An interstellar community operates under many unique restrictions,
most notably the fact that it consists of many island–planets set

###### INTRODUCTION

Naval Operations
Naval vessels generally operate in task forces or squadrons, rather
than alone; the merits of each individual ship supplement and
complement the others in company with it. Squadrons are given
a numerical designation when they are created, which are tacked
onto the squadron type to give their full squadron name. A BatRon
given the designation 175 would be known as BatRon 175, or it is also
acceptable to refer to it as the 175th BatRon.

The squadrons are also prefixed with a classification dependant
on what part of the fleet they serve with. A front line regular fleet
unit would have the classification ‘Imperial’ prefixed; a planetary
squadron is usually referred to as a colonial squadron and prefixed
‘Colonial’. Reserve squadrons are considered to be part of the
regular fleets and keep the Imperial classification.

Battle Squadrons (BatRons) are built around dreadnoughts and
battleships, and are designed to smash through enemy lines and
engage other Battle Squadrons. Auxiliary craft attached to a BatRon
are limited to a few fuel tankers and fast–moving tenders and
couriers, and must stay out of the line of fire when dreadnoughts
clash.

Cruiser Squadrons (CruRons) have a core of cruisers accompanied
by escorts and frigates. These are the work–horses of the Navy,
given assignments such as holding captured systems, interdicting

or bombarding enemy worlds, supporting the Battle Squadron
advance, or harassing enemy supply lines.

Assault Squadrons (AssaultRons) have the duty of capturing enemy
worlds, and are made up of ortillery ships and troop transports.
Often, a naval force can take control of space, but face significant
resistance on the ground, and the only way to hold a world is to put
boots on the ground.

Carrier Squadrons (CarRons) are made up of tenders or carriers—
single large ships which carry well–armed smaller ships which
actually do the fighting when battles are joined. When the craft
being carried are in the ten to thirty ton range, the ship is a fighter
carrier. When the ships being carried are in the 10,000 ton range,
and the large ship is 200,000 tons or more, the ship is called a
battle tender or transport.

The points of greatest danger to carried squadrons are immediately
prior to jump (when the craft or ships have been recalled) and just
after returning to normal space (when the craft have not yet been
launched).

Tanker Squadrons (TankRons) are mostly composed of huge fuel
tankers, which carry the millions of tons of hydrogen fuel needed by
a jump–capable fleet. As such vessels are very vulnerable, a tankron
is normally led by a cruiser and accompanied by numerous armed
escorts.

Scout Squadrons (ScoutRons) are rarely maintained full–time by the
navy, but are instead assembled as needed. ScoutRons are made up
mainly of ships borrowed from the Imperial Scout Service, together
with a handful of larger fast frigates and stealth ships.

System Defence Boats & Monitors
A considerable percentage of any starship is taken up with jump
engines and fuel tanks. This means that a non–jump–capable
ship can defeat a starship of equal or even considerably greater
tonnage. System Defence Boats are 300 to 500 ton patrol boats
used for planetary defence. Monitors are the same concept on a
capital scale – a monitor is a multi–thousand ton warship with
all its tonnage allocated to weapons and maneuver drives.
Most monitors are constructed from planetoids, or by stripping
the jump engines and fuel tanks from an outdated warship hull.
It is rare for a brand–new monitor to be built using modern
technologies, although especially important worlds can justify
such protection. Sector capitals are often protected by such
‘supermonitors’.

High Guard
Refuelling operations for a task force are another danger point,
as forces which are low on fuel and manoeuvring in a gravity well
are especially vulnerable. The high guard position, so named
because the ship or ships involved are higher in the gravity well
than their companions, is used to mount protective operations
during such maneuvers.

###### NAVY CHARACTERS

## CCREATINGREATING AA N NAVYAVY C CHARACTERHARACTER

#### BASIC CHARACTER CREATION FOR A

#### NAVAL OFFICER

This chapter follows the normal stages of character creation as
detailed in the _Traveller_ core rulebook, pointing out where and how
players and Referees can branch away from the standard career
paths in order to use what is available in _Traveller: High Guard_.

CHARACTERISTICS
The basic six characteristics of a naval character are the same as
any other character. The Imperial Navy holds a position of great
prestige across the stars, with correspondingly high Social Standing.
Planetary navies are also prestigious postings on a local scale – if
a planet can afford only a handful of warships, then the captains
and other officers occupy an exalted position in society. By contrast,
the subsector naval forces, while possibly the most important and
active part of the navy, have the lowest standing in general. Naval
characters tend to lean toward higher Dexterity, Intelligence and
Education characteristics.

HOMEWORLD
Naval characters tend to hail from long–settled, high–technology
planets, and especially from worlds with a large orbital or asteroid–
based population. There are often long traditions of naval service
in a family, where generation after generation sends its children to
space.

#### THE NAVAL CAREER PATHS

Characters produced by this career system may either be recently
mustered–out Naval officers, or if the Referee wishes to run an
active Naval campaign (see page 145), they can be still serving.

There are ten distinct Naval career paths – Crewman, Engineering,
Pilot, Gunnery, Command, Support, Small Craft Pilot, High
Command, Naval Intelligence and Naval Research. A character may
also spend four years at a naval college before embarking on his first
career term.

CHOOSING A NAVAL CAREER
There are two distinct ways to choose to roll a term on a naval career
path. Either simply meet the listed Qualifications of the path as
normal, or meet the ‘Previous Service’ terms listed for each naval
career. Some of the more exalted careers can only be reached by
working your way up the ranks.

Naval College
The Navy has a long tried and tested method of attracting high
quality recruits to its ranks by the use of Naval College and
scholarships. A prospective officer will spend time at an educational

facility where he is extensively prepared for his chosen specialist
field and prepared for command.

If a character attends naval college, he spends four years there
preparing for his career in the navy. To enter naval college, the
character must pass the Entry roll. If successful, he may choose a
course and attempt to pass the course in order to gain its benefits. A
failed course after gaining entry means the character flunks out and
spends his first term in the drifter career.

No character may attempt to enter Naval College after his first term,
the Navy has plenty of potential recruits eager to fill their ranks
and never wish to be seen as the second choice for any new officer
recruit.

Any graduate from a Naval College will be commissioned and
immediately start his first term at rank o1. A successful education
at Naval College will leave the new officer with a full set of basic
skills, some training in his chosen specialist field and, of course,
his commission as an officer. He will not have an Event or Mishap,
losing any benefits he may have gained. In addition he will not gain
a mustering out benefit for the term he spent in college.

A graduate will not immediately be placed within his specialized
service, instead serving in the Crewman roll of the navy of his choice
(it is fairly uncommon, but not unknown, for promising graduates
to opt for a naval career in their own planetary navy rather than the
more prestigious Imperial Navy, for example).

Honors Int 10+

A character that fails admission to one of the Naval Colleges is able
to then attempt to join a career of his choice and does not enter the
draft.

If admitted the new midshipman undergoes a series of tests over
the course of his term. If he succeeds he is deemed to have passed
out of the college with a commission, basic training for his chosen
field and can roll on the service skills table for the assignment of
his choice.

If the character succeeds in making his honors roll not instead of
rolling on the service skills table he is free to choose the skill of his
choice from that table.

Expanded Character Generation & Ranks
Not all ranks are available in all careers. Obviously, a legendary
commander is going to be at least of a rank where they will have a
command. A character who is not of the minimum rank number or
above the maximum rank for a career suffers a –1DM per missing
rank number when trying to qualify for that career. If a character
qualifies for a career when he is below the minimum rank, he is
promoted to that rank.

For example, the range for the Gunnery career is E4 to E9, or O2 to
O4. A character who is rank E1 would suffer a –3 DM to qualification
rolls; a character who is rank O6 would suffer a –2 DM.

Some careers are only available to commissioned characters.

For the purposes of benefits ranks o1 to o3 are the equivalent to
ranks 1 to 3 respectively in the main _Traveller_ rulebook, ranks o4 and
o5 are the equivalent to rank 4, ranks 06 and o7 to rank 5, and ranks
o8 and above to rank 6.

#### MEDALS AND COMMENDATIONS

Characters from a military background are capable of earning
medals for any heroic action they might have taken during their
years of service with the Army, Marines, Navy or within a Mercenary
career. The awards here are those presented by the Imperium to its
armed forces, different governments will have their own rewards
with their own names, although what the different medals represent
will reflect those of the Imperium. Many mercenary units will have
their own awards and since they are often working for governments
can find themselves eligible for a wide range of decorations.

These medals are awarded during character generation whenever
the character is involved in a Mishap or Event that is combat
orientated and needs a skill roll to prevent injury. The result of this
roll will determine what medal(s) are received by the character.

Combat Ribbon: Combat Ribbon: Any character that is in a combat Event or Mishap
will automatically be awarded a Combat Ribbon. These will include
a citation that will detail the character’s name, rank, unit and the
name and date of the action. Although the Imperium does keep
track of such awards they are not advertised greatly, although on
smaller planets or settlements a well–travelled favorite son may
well get a mention in the local news media if he receives a Combat
Ribbon.

Combat Command Ribbon: Combat Command Ribbon: Any officer that receives a Combat
Ribbon is automatically awarded with a Combat Command Ribbon.
This award recognizes the fact that the character has led troops into
battle and will provide the same details as a Combat Ribbon. Many
mercenary units will offer higher positions to ex–service personnel
who have a Combat Command Ribbon ahead of those who have just

Navy Type
There are three types of navies operating in the Imperium – the
planetary navies, the subsector navies, and the Imperial Navy. A
character must choose which navy he is joining when he takes
his first naval career. Some advanced naval careers are only
accessible to those in the subsector navy or Imperial navy.

A character in one navy can attempt to enlist in a different navy.
Determine ranks and benefits separately – a character who leaves
a planetary navy to join the Imperial navy drops back down to
rank 0. Some events allow a character to transfer and retain
rank and benefits. When determining previous service terms,
then planetary navies count all previous terms, subsector navies
count only subsector and Imperial terms, and the Imperial navy
counts only Imperial terms.

A character ejected from the Imperial or subsector navy through
mishap cannot reenlist in either the Imperial or subsector navy.
A character ejected from any career may attempt to join the
planetary navy again, but may join a maximum of three different
planetary navies.

###### NAVY CHARACTERS NNAVYAVY C CHARACTERSHARACTERS

Going for Glory
Some players will want to take every opportunity they can to gain
the highest military honors possible during character creation.
As a result it is possible for players to go for glory whenever they
are presented with a chance for a reward. A character may add
up to 3 to the difficulty of the skill roll, making it much more
likely to be injured. However, when it comes to receiving an
award the modifier is added to the Effect instead.

Example: Ensign Patrick Oddie is serving in his planet’s Navy,
protecting his homeworld when his vessel engages pirate forces.
He boards the pirates’ ship and he must fight them off (Event
56 on the Crewman Events Table). Deciding that this may be
his only opportunity for glory Oddie leaps into the fray, taking a
massive +3DM to the target number he needs to roll. Taking the
dice he rolls a 4 and a 3, he has a skill of 2 in Melee (Unarmed)
and 9 Str for a further +1. This gives him a total of 10, however he
needs 11+ to avoid injury and is hurt in the ensuing fight.

Checking to see if he has won a medal for his pains, he adds +
to the total for his bravery, getting a 13. This is 5 more than the
8+ normally needed to avoid injury (this number is unchanged
for the purpose of determining if the character will receive an
award), and young Patrick’s bravery does not go unnoticed. He
will receive the MCG and also gain a Purple Heart (for his injury),
a Combat Ribbon and a Combat Command Ribbon, assuming
he will survive his wounds

gained rank without having led men in combat. Local media is more
likely to pick up on the reward of such a medal, but it will not feature
in any major network or periodical.

Purple Heart: Purple Heart: Any character that has to roll on the injury table
having failed his skill roll is awarded a Purple Heart. The medal will
again have all the details of the character and incident upon it and is
considered a more notable reward than either the Combat Command
Ribbon or Combat Ribbon by most civilians. Mercenary units tend to
be less impressed though, although they will respect a man willing
to risk his life and shed blood for his cause/ship/comrades. The
award is much more likely to be featured in local media and any
character returning to his homeworld/town/neighborhood is more
likely to receive a hero’s welcome.

Meritorious Conduct under Fire (MCUF): Meritorious Conduct under Fire (MCUF): The MCUF is the first
medal for bravery awarded to those who show bravery on the field
of battle. Although many thousands of these are awarded every year
within the Imperium they are considered to be a great honor to
receive. This medal, and the more illustrious medals for bravery, is
very highly regarded in both military and civilian circles. An individual
awarded such a medal will be honored by his community with,
at the least, a public reception by local dignitaries. A character is
awarded this medal if the Effect of his skill roll is 3 or more.

Medal for Conspicuous Gallantry (MCG): Medal for Conspicuous Gallantry (MCG): Considered for acts
of great heroism, the MCG is a very notable reward indeed. The
bravery of those given this award is unquestioned and those that
receive it are likely to get widespread recognition, with larger media
outlets noting the reward. A character is awarded this medal if the
Effect of his skill roll is 5 or more.

Starburst for Extreme Heroism (SEH): Starburst for Extreme Heroism (SEH): The SEH is the highest
honor that can be achieved by an individual under arms in the
Imperium. Generals, Admirals and Subsector Dukes will all salute
the man, or woman, who has shown the outstanding heroic qualities
necessary to win the award. Despite the vast nature of the Imperium
and many conflicts that it will be engaged in an individual receiving
the medal is still notable enough to be reported in major news media
and those that receive the reward can expect a (deserved) hero’s
welcome when they return home. A mercenary unit will welcome
a bearer of the medal into its ranks, the prestige alone being worth
their while, let alone the benefit of having such a notable warrior
within its ranks. A character is awarded this medal if the Effect of
his skill roll is 7 or more.

Long Service Medal: Long Service Medal: Any character that serves five or more
terms in any Navy automatically receives the Long Service
medal.

Meritorious Performance of Duties Medal:Meritorious Performance of Duties Medal: This medal is awarded
whenever a member of the military performs his duties to an
exceptional standard. In game terms whenever a character needs to
roll a skill on his events table and rolls a natural 12 he is deemed to
have impressed his superiors enough during that term to be made
a recipient of this award.

MEDAL BENEFITS
A character who wins a medal may apply a DM from that medal to
any one Survival, Qualification or Promotion roll. The DM from a
medal may only be applied once.

When a character is mustering out, any medal DMs left unused may
be converted into extra benefit rolls, at the rate of one roll per 2 DMs
left unused, rounding down.

The bulk of the crew on board any naval vessel are low–ranking
crewmen, serving under more senior officers. Unlike other careers,
the crewman career is divided not by specialization, but by the type
of the navy. Planetary navies are small–scale affairs, normally only a
handful of pirate hunter and customs ships or system defence boats.
Subsector navies are the backbone of the Imperium, providing local
defence and patrolling the spaceways. The Imperial Navy is the
most prestigious assignment, but also the most dangerous.

service. Without drill sergeants and instructors in naval academies,
without doctors and cybernetisists, without administrators and
accountants, the great machine of the navy would grind to a halt.

strong record of service before moving onto a higher career.

2 Your ship misjumps, and spends months stranded in deep space. Inquiries into the cause of the misjump hound you
out of the service.
3 Through either tiredness or negligence a routine maneuver results in a collision with another ship.
4 You serve under a captain who is overly strict. Make Pilot, Comms and Sensors 8+. If you succeed at all three, you
may continue in this career. Otherwise, leave the career and gain the captain as a Rival.
5 Other flight deck crew members on your ship are using stimulant drugs to increase their endurance. If you do not do
so, you fall behind and are replaced. If you do so, you may continue on this career, but lose one benefit roll and have
an addiction to stimulants.
6 Severely wounded. Roll twice on the Injury table and take the lower result.
7 A superior officer develops inappropriate feelings for you which you manage to rebuff. However he or she becomes
vindictive and you are forced out of the service. Gain the officer as a Rival.
8 Injured – roll once on the Injury table.
9 A Jump routine is particularly harrowing and you develop a complex called Jump Space Blindspot Phobia, caused by
gazing for too long into the strange null–zone of jump space. You are mustered out of the service as a result. You can
still make jump trips, but must roll End 9+ to avoid becoming an emotional, dysfunctional wreck for the voyage.
10 One of your orders or decisions sends several crewmen to their deaths. You may leave the service with an extra skill
roll driven by guilt.
11 A disagreement with an unstable colleague over a minor bridge decision descends into an unseemly brawl. You gain a
Rival as you are both drummed out of the service (this was not the first breach of discipline for either of you).
12 After a particularly heavy session on shore leave you invite a couple of newly found drinking companions onto your
ship, currently docked in port. Sneaking past the few security staff on board you are determined to show your guests
what a great pilot you are, and manage to collide with a noble’s yacht. Your gross incompetence is rewarded with the
loss of your Benefit roll for this term and a dishonorable discharge after your court martial.

information you are forced to resign your position but do so in the knowledge you have saved many lives. Your actions
gain you a Contact in the High Command who respects your devotion to duty towards fellow navy personnel.
4 You are accused of malpractice or criminal behaviour. You may stay on in this career if you sacrifice all benefit rolls and
reduce your Social Standing by two.
5 Whilst a brilliant technician you have never been particularly well suited to the discipline of Navy service. Your maverick
nature gets you into trouble one time to many and you have to look for employment elsewhere.
6 Severely Injured – roll twice on the naval injury table and take the lower result.
7 The Navy fails to realise your brilliance in your field, instead relying on the opinions of intellectual third raters and
unimaginative dolts. Your resignation is accepted with glee by your commanders, perhaps you should not have
threatened resignation so forcefully in an attempt to make them change their minds?
8 Injured – roll on the Injury table.
9 Through diligent research a project you are working on makes a profound discovery that will save the fleet millions in
costs. However your research is appropriated by a rival who has friends in high places, your protestations lead to a
court martial and you are thrown out of the service. You gain Engineering, but also gain a Rival.
10 An attempt to reverse–engineer an alien vessel goes awry, and you got misjumped into deep space. Gain Survival 1,
Streetwise 1 or Pilot (any) 1 on your way home.

in any case and if they are offering money to make you say what you were going to say anyway, more fool them. The
presiding officer at your court martial did not quite see things the same way, unfortunately.

#### NAVAL EVENTS

unexpected moment of terror and extreme danger.

#### NEW SKILLS

_High Guard_ introduces two new skills to the _Traveller_ skill list.
Engineer (naval) is only used in cases where characters are designing
and building their own vessels, which is outside the scope of most
games. Similarly, Discipline is usually used only in campaigns where
the characters are still in the navy.

Engineer (naval)
This speciality of the Engineer skill covers the design and
construction of starships. It is of limited practical use in the field,

but can be substituted for any other Engineer speciality at a –2DM
when dealing with starship systems. For example, a character with
Naval Engineer 3 could make a skill test calling for Engineer (life
support) with a –2 DM when trying to repair a starship’s air scrubber,
but could not use his Naval Engineer skill to fix a malfunctioning
navigation system on an air/raft.

Discovering a design flaw in a prototype ship underground shakedown:
1–6 days, Intelligence, Difficult (–2)
Designing a new class of starship: 1–6 years, Education, Hard (–4)

###### NAVY CHARACTERS NNAVYAVY C CHARACTERSHARACTERS

Discipline
The martial Discipline skill covers self–control, ingrained reflexes
and training. A character with a high Discipline is adept at following
orders and procedures. In game terms, as long as the character is
in a situation covered by his training, he may reduce any negative
DM by an amount equal to his Discipline skill. This may be done a
number of times each day equal to his Discipline skill. This can only
be applied to skills that the character already has at a skill level of
1 or more.

For example, a character with Discipline 1 could reduce a DM of –2 to
–1, or a DM of –4 to –3 once a day. A character with Discipline 3 could
reduce a DM of –2 to +0, or of –4 to –1 up to three times per day.

Discipline cannot turn a negative DM into a positive DM – training
allows a character to do the right thing and ignore distractions, but
does not give him any extra competence or ability.

#### NEW BENEFITS

Imperial Consort: Imperial Consort: The character is offered the chance to wed a
member of a highly influential noble family. This consort gives +2
Social Standing, and a dowry of 2d6 x 10,000 credits.

Independent Operation: Independent Operation: The character may set up his own business
or group that works with the navy, such as a mercenary group, spy
network or private think–tank. The navy will pay up to 20 ship shares
or 1d6 MCr towards initial start-up costs, as long as the character
agrees to favor them as a client.

Retainer: Retainer: The navy wishes to retain the character’s services, calling
on him as a consultant or advisor. The character will be paid Cr.
1,000 per month on condition that he remain available for naval
service when called upon.

Prototype: Prototype: You are given a prototype ship component or technology,
such as an advanced weapon or combat implant. This item is
technically still the property of the Imperial navy, but you are
permitted to test it in the field.

#### ALIEN NAVAL CHARACTERS

The most common setting for the Traveller game, the Third
Imperium, has several major alien races that players and Referees
can choose to create characters from. The rules for Naval careers
above are aimed primarily at Imperium characters, but the other
alien powers have their own space navies.

Aslan
Aslan naval forces break down clearly by gender lines – males take
command, and females take every other role. Often, the command
staff of an Aslan cruiser will be a single pride, with the alpha male
in command. Aslan forces traditionally favor heavy fighter screens
over capital ships.

Modifiers: Modifiers: Male Aslan receive a +1 DM to all Advancement rolls
using Str, Dex or End. Female Aslan receive this +1 DM bonus to
Advancement rolls using Int, Edu or Soc. However, they both suffer
a –1 DM penalty to their Cash Benefits rolls when mustering out.

Droyne
Droyne worlds are rarely rich enough to have their own naval forces.
They do make excellent mechanics and engineers, and their small
stature means they can be crammed four to a stateroom. Some
megacorporations hire Droyne ex–naval engineers.

Modifiers: Modifiers: Droyne have a +1 DM when Qualifying for the Support,
Engineer or Naval Engineer careers.

Hivers
The Hiver fleets are notoriously powerful and dangerous. The Hivers
do not use fighters normally, preferring to deploy combat drones
instead. Their massive capital ships are among the largest in the
galaxy; some are more like flying cities than mere vessels.

Modifiers: Modifiers: Hivers cannot choose the Pilot career, but have a +2 DM
when qualifying for Naval Intelligence careers.

K’Kree
The K’Kree dislike space travel, and have few ships. They make poor
naval officers.

Modifiers: Modifiers: K’Kree have a –1 DM to qualifying for all Naval careers.

Vargr
Vargr find the strict discipline of the Navy stultifying, but can make
skilled officers if they persevere. They are especially adept as pilots
and gunners.

Modifiers: Modifiers: Vargr automatically gain a +1 DM modifier to any
Qualification tests to enter the Flight, Pilot or Gunner career path,
but have a –2DM on all Discipline checks.

Zhodani
The psionic Zhodani have a powerful navy, co–ordinated by
telepathic officers. The strict hierarchy and command structure of
the navy suits their authoritarian society.
Modifiers: Modifiers: Zhodani have a +1 DM to all naval Qualification rolls.

Uplifted Animals
The only uplifted animals that are especially suited to a Naval life
are cetaceans, who make excellent navigators and have a +2 DM to
Qualification rolls for the Flight career.

###### NNAVYAVY C CHARACTERSHARACTERS

#### CHARACTER CREATION EXAMPLE

The following example provides an illustration of the process of
creating a human navy character. Actual die throws are shown in
brackets, as are comments on the application of game rules. Die
modifications are labelled DM, as is standard in _Traveller_ products.

Harek Haradson, Fighter Pilot
First, Harek rolls for his characteristics. He gets a 7, 7, 9, 6, 7 and

12. He allocates the characteristics as follows: Strength 7 (DM +0),
Dexterity 12 (DM +2), Endurance 7 (DM +0), Intelligence 9 (DM +1),
Education 7 (DM +0) and Social Standing 6 (DM +0). His Education
of 7 gives him 0+3 background skills. He comes from a High–Tech
Asteroid colony, so he picks up Zero–G 0 and Computers 0. He also
learns Space Science 0 from the Education list.

Harek attempts to enter naval college, but his low social standing
prevents him [required roll of Soc 6+ to enlist, rolls a 5]. He will have
to work his way up through the ranks.

FIRST TERM:
Harek enlists in the Subsector Navy as an ordinary crewman
[enlistment requires Int 6+, and he rolls a 9, +1 for his Intelligence
score for a total of 10]. His basic training gives him a grounding in
all aspects of ship operation, and his knack for piloting is quickly
discovered. [As this is his first term, he picks up all the service skills
at level 0, and Piloting (spacecraft) at level 1.] He distinguishes
himself [rolling an 13 on the Event table] and wins his commission
[using the +4 DM from the Event to ensure he becomes an officer,
then rolls an 8 for Advancement].

As a junior officer, he is trained in sensor operations as well
as behaviour befitting his new rank [gains Sensors 1 from his
Advancement, Melee 1 from being a Rank 1 officer and Leadership 1
from being a Rank 2 Officer].

SECOND TERM:
Ambitiously, Harek decides to transfer to the Pilot branch of the
service [Qualification Dexterity 8+, rolls an 8, +2 for his Dexterity
DM]. He picks up Gunner 0 as his basic training, and Athletics 1 as
a Fighter Pilot.

He survives his term by the skin of his teeth [needs a 7+ to survive, rolls
a 5, +2 for his Dexterity]. While on patrol, he encounters a colony of
asteroid miners under attack by raiders from a neighboring system.
The subsector navy has decided this is an internal matter, and will
not intervene, but Harek cannot stand idly by [rolls a 56 on the events
table]. He rallies his squadron and leads a secret strike against the
raiders [the Referee and Harek’s player agree that he actually launches
an attack instead of just passing on information]. One of the asteroid
miners becomes a firm friend of Harek [gains an Ally].

He is promoted once more [rolls a 10 for Advancement] and studies
the art of war [gains Tactics (naval)].

THIRD TERM:
Continuing on as a pilot, Harek is trained in EVA operations [gains
Vacc Suit 1]. He avoids any mishap, but his ship becomes involved
in a major engagement [rolls a 52 on the event table].

The enemy force has taken up a strong defensive position in close
orbit of the world of Ataris. Harek’s squadron is ordered to attack
but Harek breaks off at the last moment.

His commanding officer is furious with Harek’s disobedience, and
he is ejected from the navy [rolls a 6 for Advancement, but the –4
DM from the event means that he is below the threshold, rolling
less than the total number of terms served].

His benefits for three terms in the subsector navy are 37,000 Credits,
a Ship’s Boat, two Ship Shares, and higher standing [+1 Soc].

FOURTH TERM:
Harek has left the subsector navy, but he is a veteran naval officer
and is offered a position in a plantetary naval. He has spent three
terms in the navy already, and this experience pays off – he can take
up a position and rank analogous to his old posting. [Two terms in
the navy allow him to automatically qualify for the Pilot career, and
he enters it at the minimal rank of O2].

He continues to improve his mastery of tactics [gaining Naval Tactics
again]. One mission is especially hazardous [rolls a 14 for event, but
passes the test], and he gains a Contact and is awarded a Citation
for Meritorious Conduct Under Fire. Promoted once more, Harek
realises that after sixteen years in the navy, his once–promising
career is floundering in a backwater naval force. [He passes his first
Aging roll without a problem.] He decides to leave the navy and
strike out on his own...

[He picks up another 10,000 credits for his final benefit roll from his
terms. He also has a +2 DM left over from his Citation, so he can
convert that into another benefit roll, which gives him Armor].

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
With no connections to other characters, Harek gains no extra skills.
He takes Astrogation and Flyer from the skill package for the party.

###### NAVY CHARACTERS

The Traveller core rulebook presented several options for spacecraft
design. This chapter adds a host of new subsystems and components,
which can be part of a new design or retrofitted into an old one.

#### STRUCTURE

These options alter the basic framework of the ship, and require
considerable time in a shipyard to install.

Reinforced Structure: Reinforced Structure: By adding internal armor protection and
structural reinforcement, a ship can withstand more structural
damage. For every 5% of the ship’s total tonnage allocated to
reinforced structure, the ship gains extra structure points. Reinforced
structure costs MCr 0.2/ton.

Reinforced Hull: Reinforced Hull: Reinforcing the external hull is easier than
reinforcing internal systems. For every 10% of the ship’s total
tonnage allocated to reinforced hull, the ship gains extra hull points.
Reinforced hull costs MCr 0.1/ton.

Armored Bulkheads: Armored Bulkheads: Armored bulkheads protect any internal
components to which they are added. Adding internal bulkheads
requires tonnage equal to 10% of the tonnage of the protected
system, but negates the first hit on that system. For example, if a
ship has a 30–ton power plant, then adding armored bulkheads to
protect the reactor costs three tons, but means the first Power Plant hit
is ignored. Armored bulkheads cost MCr 0.2/ton.

Modular Hull:Modular Hull: Up to 75% of a ship’s internal tonnage may be
designated as modular, allowing it to be swapped out easily. This
tonnage may not include the bridge, power plant, drives or any
structural or armor options. Different modules can be installed
for different tasks. Making a modular hull increases the cost of the
overall hull by the percentage designated as modular.

Example: A hundred–ton hull normally costs MCr 2.0. If 30% of the
ship’s hull is going to be made modular, then the cost of the hull is
increased to MCr 2.6, 130% of the original cost. This means that 30 tons
of the ship’s components could easily be swapped out from mission to
mission. When hauling passengers, the ship could install a module with
six staterooms and six tons of cargo space (totalling 30 tons). When
going into combat, the ship could install a module with a triple turret
and a fighter hangar totalling 30 tons.

#### ARMOR

There are limitations on the amount of armor that can be added
to a spacecraft due to the technology level of the metallurgy. This is
defined by the table below.

Armor does not need to be added in 5% elements, but it must
be added in whole armor point values. For example, the minimum
element which can be added for Titanium Steel is 2.5%, which is a
single point of armor.

Armor options must be added when the ship’s armor is installed,
and cannot be easily retrofitted.

Heat Shielding: Heat Shielding: Heat shielding protects the ship against the heat
of re–entry or other heat sources such as proximity to a star. A ship
without a functioning gravitic drive attempting re–entry without heat
shielding will burn up. If equipped with undamaged heat shielding,
re–entry is successful on easy (+4) Pilot, 10–60 minutes skill check,
with failure resulting in burn up (this task is often undertaken more
slowly). Damage to the ship from proximity to a star in the absence
of heat shielding are at the referee’s discretion, but should be harsh!
Heat shielding does not provide protection against starship combat
weapons; even fusion weapons. Heat shielding costs MCr 0.1 per
ton of hull

## SSPACECRAFTPACECRAFT O OPTIONSPTIONS

###### SSPACECRAFTPACECRAFT O OPTIONSPTIONS SPACECRAFT OPTIONS

Radiation Shielding: Radiation Shielding: Radiation shielding improves the ship’s
protection against radiation from both natural sources (solar flares,
pulsars) and artificial (nuclear bombs, meson hits). A ship with
radiation shielding decreases the amount of rads absorbed by all
crew by 1,000, treats the bridge as if it is hardened and provides
6 extra armor points against radiation damage from nuclear
weapons, particle beams and fusion guns. Radiation shielding costs
MCr 0.25 per ton of hull.

#### POWER

Emergency Power: Emergency Power: An emergency power system allows a vessel to
keep functioning even when its main power plant has been knocked
offline by damage and is a cheaper alternative than a second backup
power plant as described on page 106 of the main rule book”.. If
the power plant suffers a third hit, the emergency power system
activates, and allows the ship to function normally for 30 minutes
or 5 Combat Rounds of full operations – or until it suffers another
power plant hit.

An emergency power system has a tonnage and cost equal to 10%
of the tonnage and cost of the main power plant.

Chemical power plants:Chemical power plants: A chemical power plant is 40% bigger than
its fusion equivalent, costs MCr 1.25 per ton and requires 20 times
the amount of fuel for the same endurance.

Fission power plants: Fission power plants: Page 109 of the core rule book (first printing)
is now amended. Fission plants provide the same power as a fusion
power plant and can provide any power performance level. However,
they are twice the size and price of a fusion power plant. They are
available at TL7.

Solar Panel: Solar Panel: Extendible solar panels provide backup power for
vessel’s power plants. They are sometimes installed in scout or
mining ships, giving them greater range and endurance. The size of
solar panels required to power a ship is 1/10th that of the main power
plant, to a minimum of 0.5 tons. If the panels are fitted to a ship
without a power plant, then assume the (non–existent) main power
plant is sized to deliver a performance rating of 1. A ship equipped
with solar panels consumes power plant fuel at one–quarter the
normal rate as long as it is only engaged in minimal manoeuvring
and does not fire weapons. Minimal manoeuvring does not include
long periods at full thrust, so solar panels are useless for trade
vessels. Solar panels cost MCr 0.1 per ton. No power plant fuel is
consumed, and endurance is considered as infinite, if the ship is
not manoeuvring, using active sensors or refining fuel for use. Jump
cannot be entered with solar panels deployed.

_For example, a laboratory ship has Power Plant D, which takes up
13 tons. Adding solar panels would consume 1.3 tons (one–tenth of
13) and allow the lab ship to go for eight weeks between power plant
refuelling, as long as the ship was only engaged in light survey work._

Chemical Batteries: Chemical Batteries: The sizes of chemical batteries are based on
the power plant required to deliver a performance rating of 1. A
chemical battery the same size as a fusion power plant of the same
tech level will provide 1000 hours of use assuming the vessel is not
manoeuvring, using active sensors, refining fuel, making significant
use of long range communicators or energy using weapons (such
as lasers, rail guns, meson guns, fusion guns and particle beams).
Alternatively, the same sized battery will give 1 hour (10 combat
turns) of performance without these restrictions. A battery can be
scaled in size to give any endurance and costs 4 times the equivalent
fusion power plant. A TL7 battery is the same size as a TL 8 battery.
For example, a TL7 B–rated battery with 2000 hours of endurance will
require (7 x 2000/1000) 14 tons and cost MCr (16 x 2000/1000 x 4) 108.
The time to recharge a battery is equivalent to the battery endurance
used (in low power setting) divided by 1000 then multiplied by 2. If
using solar panels to recharge the battery, the “power plant rating”
is 0.1. For example the battery described above has been used for 1600
hours. To recharge it with solar panels will require (1600 /1000/0.1 x2)
32 hours.

#### DRIVES

Maneuver Drive
The gravitic drive is the standard for spacecraft throughout the
Imperium, combining efficiency with moderately high thrust. Two
other drives are also used as a lower technology option– reaction
drives or rockets can provide greater thrust, but require prohibitively
large amounts of reaction mass. Solar sails, by contrast, require no
power or reaction mass, but are so slow as to be useless to anything
other than automated cargo ships and pleasure yachts.

Reaction Drive: Reaction Drive: The reaction drive takes the same space as a gravitic
drive, and costs less, but this is offset by the large fuel requirements
in addition to fuel used for the jump drive and power plant. To
calculate a ship’s fuel requirements, use the following system:

Fuel Required (as a percentage of the ship’s displacement) = 2.5% x
Maximum Thrust x hours of Maximum Thrust required.

For example, if a thrust of 4G for two hours is required, then 4 x 2 x
2.5% = 20% of the ship’s tonnage must be dedicated to fuel.

As space combat turns are 6 minutes long, each hour of fuel gives
10 turns of operation at maximum thrust. The total reserve of fuel
is expressed as a number of G/Turns, which are equivalent to the
total number of thrust points available. In the example above, the ship
has (4G x 2 hours) = 8 G/Hours of thrust for combat. When expressed
in G/Turns the G/Hours are multiplied by 10 to give 80 G/Turns of
operation. Each thrust point spent reduces the number of G/Turns
remaining in the tank, and a ship cannot maneuver once this fuel
is spent.

###### SPACECRAFT OPTIONS SPACECRAFT OPTIONS

Stealth Jump: Stealth Jump: A stealth jump drive minimises the burst of radiation
caused by the transition from jump space into real space. Normally,
a ship that emerges into real space will be automatically detected
if it emerges within the “minimal” detail range of the sensor.
However, detecting a ship equipped with a stealth drive emerging
into real space requires a Sensor, Intelligence or Education, Difficult
(–2) skill check if within “limited” detail range of the sensor or a
Very Difficult (–4) skill check if within “Minimal” detail range of the
sensor. A stealth drive takes up no extra tonnage but costs ten times
the amount of a standard jump drive.

#### FUEL

Drop Tank: Drop Tank: Military assault ships sometimes use external fuel tanks
that are explosively jettisoned as the ship enters jump space. The
virtue of a drop tank is that it allows a ship to carry a large amount of
extra fuel, but the tank carries a risk. Jumping is a delicate procedure,
which is greatly complicated by having big empty fuel tanks flying
around in close proximity to the jump bubble.

Jump tanks come in two parts. Firstly, there are the docking ports,
fuel injectors and explosive collars that allow the spacecraft to
mount drop tanks and to jettison them quickly. Secondly, there are
the physical tanks themselves.

A drop tank mount costs MCr1 per 50 tons of fuel in the drop tank,
and takes up two tons of space per 50 tons of fuel for the fittings to
transfer fuel.

A drop tank itself costs MCr 0.1 per 50 tons of fuel space.

For example, a mercenary cruiser wants to mount a 250 ton drop tank.
This would cost MCr5 and take up ten tons of internal space. The tank
itself would cost MCr 0.5.

Jumping using a drop tank applies a –(15–TL) DM to the roll for
misjumping (see page 141 in the core rulebook).

Burning Your Bridges (or using Jump Fuel
in an Emergency)
Starships have jump drives, which require significant amounts
of fuel to sustain a jump. If you have enough jump fuel left it is
possible to start to draw on the jump reserve for the Reaction
Drive. Each parsec of Jump capability requires 10% of the
tonnage of the hull in fuel. Each 10% of fuel will provide an extra
40 Thrust Points of Operations.

However, each time the fuel is reduced below a 10% increment,
the jump range is decreased by 1 parsec. So, if an Cruiser with
Jump 2 worth of fuel left in the tanks was forced to eat into its
jump reserve, the first fuel used would reduce the range to 1
parsec, and jump would no longer be capable once fuel fell
below 10%. This is a risky maneuver for an attacker, as this
reduces their chance to escape from a system that they have
jumped into and attacked.

It is not usual to use the fuel dedicated to the power plant in
such a situation as all other systems – including life support

- will fail if this is burned.

Solar Sail: Solar Sail: A deployed solar sail covers an area dozens of kilometers
across. It is made of a flexible synthetic fabric that has limited self–
repair capabilities. Particles emitted by the sun – the ‘solar wind’
catch the sail and provide a minuscule amount of thrust. A ship
using a solar sail as its primary method of propulsion has a Thrust of
0 and requires several days or weeks to change its course or speed.
A solar sail costs MCr 0.01 per ton of ship, and takes up 5% of the
ship’s total tonnage when stowed. Obviously, this is ineffective in a
combat situation. Jump drive can not be used with a sail deployed.

Jump Drive
Fast–Cycle Jump: Fast–Cycle Jump: A normal jump drive requires the engine to be
prepped before jump, and the ship cannot jump again until the
engine has been prepared and the ship’s batteries have recharged.
This procedure takes at least one hour, and usually as many as
sixteen if all checks are preformed. A fast–cycle drive recharges
much faster and does not normally require preparation. After a
jump, roll 2d6. On a 3+, the drive does not need a preparation roll
and can jump again immediately. However, the time between jumps
raises the chance of a misjump.

Time Between JumpsTime Between Jumps Misjump DMMisjump DM
One minute or less –6
One minute to 30 minutes –2
30 minutes to one hour –1

A fast–cycle jump drive costs 10% more than a conventional jump
drive.

###### SSPACECRAFTPACECRAFT O OPTIONSPTIONS SPACECRAFT OPTIONS

When a drop tank is used, roll 2d6. On an 8+, the tank survives the
ejection process and can be retrieved and reused. Otherwise, it is
destroyed by the expanding jump bubble or warped by the jettison
explosion. At TL14 the use of drop tanks has been improved to such
a degree that drop tanks designed at this tech level or above will
automatically survive use.

A ship’s M–Drive rating must be recalculated when carrying a drop
tank. For example, a 200–ton ship with a 150–ton drop tank counts
as being a 400–ton ship for the purposes of determining its effective
M–Drive rating. Round the tank’s tonnage up to the nearest hull
size. Drop tanks can also be used to store fuel for other purposes,
such as reaction drive propellant.

The jump performance for the ship is calculated assuming that
the drop tanks are not attached unless the jump is to be carried
out without jettisoning the drop tanks. In this case, the jump
performance should be calculated in a similar manner to the
effective M–Drive rating.

The power plant rating must be calculated assuming the drop tanks
are not in place.

Drop tanks are relatively fragile and if they are attached when the
ship is attacked, they are very vulnerable to fire. A drop tank has
one hull point and one structure point per 100 tons. Determine the
proportion of the drop tank is of the combined ship and drop tank.
When the ship is fired on, there is a probability equal to this that the
drop tank will be hit, until the drop tank is destroyed. For every point
of damage it will suffer hit it will take hull and structure damage as
normal and automatically suffer a “fuel” hit as well to the fuel in
the drop tank. _For example, a 400 ton ship has a 100 ton drop tank.
Until the drop tank is destroyed, any fire against the ship has a 20%
probability of hitting the tank instead of the ship._

Metal Hydride storage:Metal Hydride storage: Instead of storing the ship’s hydrogen
in liquid form at extremely low temperature with a high risk of
explosion if a leak occurs into the inhabited spaces of the ship,
it is possible to store hydrogen in a more bulky form in a room
temperature non–flammable metal hydride matrix. Any portion of
the ship’s fuel tankage may be designated as metal hydride storage.
This storage holds 50% less hydrogen fuel than a more normal tank.
It is available at TL9 and costs MCr0.2 per ton. If the storage is hit
the following revised damage rules are used:

First Hit: minor damage 1d6% of fuel lost
Second Hit: loss of 1d6x3% fuel
Third and Subsequent Hits: as per normal fuel hit.

#### BRIDGE

The bridge is the nerve center of the ship, and vital to onboard
operations. Old Vilani bridge designs put the captain and other

command staff on a raised balcony or walkway over the workstations;
the Solomani layout generally puts the captain in the center. Scout
ship bridges are notoriously cramped and smelly – even more so in
Belter mining ships where the bridge and living space is sometimes
combined to maximise cargo capacity – while some groups of free
traders pride themselves on the elegance and style of their command
stations.

Command Bridge: Command Bridge: A command bridge is intended for use by
warships that will be co–ordinating the efforts of a squadron of
other spacecraft. It incorporates a large–scale holographic display
of fleet actions, enhanced communications and control electronics,
and space for more command staff. A spacecraft command bridge
takes up 80 tons, but gives a +1 DM to Tactics (naval tactics) checks.
A command bridge costs 50% more than a conventional bridge
of the same size. Capital ship command bridges take up 80 tons
per section of ship and located in a single location (which may be
separate from the main bridge).

Compact Bridge: Compact Bridge: A compact bridge crams as much equipment and
control stations into as small a place as possible. Compact bridges
take up 25% less tonnage than a normal bridge of the same type.
However, all skill checks performed on the bridge suffer a –1 DM
due to the un–ergonomic design.

Detachable Bridge: Detachable Bridge: This bridge design can be ejected from the
ship in an emergency to become a lifeboat for the command crew.
The bridge has two weeks of life support and battery power, while
emergency thrusters give it basic manoeuvring capabilities. A
detachable bridge is even capable of soft–landing on a planetary
surface. Detachable bridges may not be fitted to ships of more than
6,000 tons. See the table below for details of the various types of
this bridge.

Hardened Bridge: Hardened Bridge: A hardened bridge is shielded against radiation
attacks. The ship’s computer systems are immune to EMP and the
number of rads absorbed by the bridge crew is reduced by 1,000.
Hardening a bridge adds 25% to the cost of the bridge. If a ship has
radiation shielding installed, it is assumed to be hardened.

###### SPACECRAFT OPTIONS SSPACECRAFTPACECRAFT O OPTIONSPTIONS

Holographic Controls: Holographic Controls: This bridge design incorporates advanced
interactive holographic displays, reconfiguring itself to adapt to
the current situation. A bridge with holographic controls is always
optimized, and gives a +2 bonus when rolling for Initiative. A
holographic bridge adds 25% to the cost of the bridge.

#### SENSORS

Upgraded sensor suites are common on larger vessels.

Survey Sensors: Survey Sensors: Survey sensors integrate a suite of probe drones and
deployable satellites into the sensor system, and are optimized for
scanning large areas at great speed. Survey sensors are equivalent
to Advanced Sensors, but reduce the time taken to scan a planetary
surface by one step.

Countermeasures Suite: Countermeasures Suite: A countermeasures suite is specifically
designed for jamming enemy transmissions. It is functionally
equivalent to an advanced sensor suite, but has a higher DM for
counter–measures. Meson transmissions cannot be jammed. The
DM for these sensors is +4.

Military Countermeasures Suite: Military Countermeasures Suite: The military counter–measures
suite is the cutting edge of counter–measure technology in the
Imperium, incorporating both powerful transmitters and advanced
electronic–warfare programs to shut down enemy communications.
The DM for these sensors is +6.

Sensor Upgrades
Any sensor suite may be upgraded with a range of options to improve
likelihood and quality of information and the range at which objects
may be detected.

Improved Signal Processing: Improved Signal Processing: (TL 11, 1 ton , MCr 4) Signal processing
consists of extremely specialized computers and software to improve
the quality and likelihood of detection. Improved signal processing
provides a +2 DM to sensor tasks and improves of range band
of “full” and “limited” by 1 for radar, lidar, densitometer, thermal
and visual sensors. However, this comes at a cost of increased
vulnerability to jamming, with all jamming DMs doubled.

Enhanced Signal Processing:Enhanced Signal Processing: (TL 13, 2 tons, MCr 8) As for Improved
Signal processing except that it has a +4 DM, the range band increase
is two and the susceptibility to jamming has been overcome.

Distributed Arrays: Distributed Arrays: (TL 11, triples weight and cost of sensor suite
and associated signal processing). By using multiple hull mounted
arrays in an integrated computer controlled arrangement, it is
possible to increase the effective sensor antenna size and increase
the longest range of the sensor (all increased range performance is
at “minimal” level of detail). Visual and Thermal sensors can now
detect at Very Distant Range (from 150,000 to 300,000km), EM and
active radar/lidar to Distant range (50,000–150,000km) and passive
radar/lidar to Long range. This modification can not be added to
standard sensors and can only be added to ships of 5,000 tons

displacement or more. Due to their surface area requirements only
one sensor suite per craft can be fitted with distributed or extended
arrays.

Extended Arrays:Extended Arrays: As per the distributed array, but as the arrays are
extended well beyond the hull of the ship on retractable arms, there
is no limit on the size of the ship. However, with the arms extended
the ship can be detected at a +2 DM by all sensors bar NAS and it
may not use its maneuver or jump drive.

#### EXTERNAL COMPONENTS

External components are mounted on the exterior of the hull of a
spacecraft.

Aerofins: Aerofins: Extendible aerofins improve a spacecraft’s manoeuvrability
in atmosphere only, giving a +2 DM to all Piloting checks made in
an atmosphere. Aerofins take up 5% of the ship’s tonnage, and cost
MCr0.1 per ton. The DMs for atmospheric operations (see page 137
core rulebook) still apply.

Breaching Tube: Breaching Tube: All airlocks include flexible plastic docking tubes
that allow passengers to cross from one ship to another by floating
through the air–filled tube. A breaching tube is a military version of
the common docking tube. Instead of a thin myomer, the breaching
tube is made of a combination of ballistic cloth and reflec. The
breaching tube does not end in a docking collar, but in a magnetic
clamp with a ring of plasma torches that can burn through the hull
of an enemy vessel when attached.

A breaching tube takes up three tons of space and costs MCr 3.

To use the breaching tube the craft must be adjacent to the target
vessel and then succeed in a docking action (see Core Rule book
page 147). As the vessel does not have to line up with an airlock,
this maneuver is easier than using a normal docking tube and
receives a +1 DM if the boarding vessel does not want to enter via
the airlock.

If access is acquired via an airlock the plasma torches quickly burn
through the airlock and boarding can begin immediately. If trying to
get through the hull, the plasma torches will take 1 full turn to cut
through, increasing by 1 turn for each 2 points of armor (round
down).

Each breaching tube provides 5 armor against personal and vehicle
weapons and 10 armor against lasers. A hit from a starship weapon
will destroy the breaching tube if a successful Point Defence roll is
made (see core rulebook p149).

Docking Clamp: Docking Clamp: A docking clamp allows a spacecraft to carry a
small craft or other vessel on the outside of the hull. Recalculate the
ship’s Thrust Number by adding the tonnage of the spacecraft and
the docked craft together, round up to the nearest hull size, then
compare that to the thrust by drive volume table. If performance is

###### SSPACECRAFTPACECRAFT O OPTIONSPTIONS SPACECRAFT OPTIONS

reduced to the point that it has no rating, then treat the ship as if
it has the equivalent of a solar sail. Jump performance is reduced
in a similar manner, but reductions below 1 mean the drive cannot
function.

_For example, a 200–ton vessel has a docking clamp. Attached to the
clamp is a 50–ton cutter. Together, the vessels have a displacement
tonnage of 250, which is rounded up to 300. The 200–ship has M–Drive
B, which gives the combined spacecraft a Thrust of 1. When the cutter
disconnects from the clamp, the 200–tonner will be back at its normal
thrust of 2._

The size of the vessel that can be clamped depends on the size of
the docking clamp.

50 2,000+ MCr 8.0

Grappling Arm: Grappling Arm: A grappling arm is a remote–control device for
picking up or manipulating objects in space. The arm is a flexible
tentacle of thousands of telescoping segments, capable of reaching
out up to 250 meters. The arm ends in a set of cameras and grippers
of varying sizes, from large claws to tiny micro–manipulators. It also
carries a toolkit which can be customised for a particular task.

A grappling arm takes up two tons of space and costs MCr 1.

#### INTERNAL COMPONENTS

These options include new rooms and facilities for the crew, as well
as safety and security features.

Armory: Armory: Ships carrying a large number of marines or soldiers can
benefit from an armory, a specialized weapons store. An armory
can only be accessed by those with the correct codes (usually the
ship’s senior officers and security team) and contains a wide variety
of weapons. In game terms, an armory has enough snub pistols
for the crew, enough accelerator or gauss rifles for any marines, and
a selection of other military equipment like grenades, combat drug
packs, combat armor and communications equipment. A general
armory for a spacecraft costs MCr 0.5 and takes up two 2 tons of
space.

Where military vessels are concerned, the number of armories
built into the ship’s design is based on crew size. One armory is
installed for either every 50 crew members, or every 10 marines,
in order to provide adequate storage for equipment, weapons and
ammunition.

Briefing Room: Briefing Room: A specialized briefing room is useful on mercenary
cruisers and other adventuring ships, where teams can discuss
plans or meet with clients privately. A briefing room gives a +1 DM
to Tactics (military tactics) checks made when planning missions
on board ship. Ships with command bridges and fighter squadrons
require additional briefing rooms and facilities. Capital ships must
therefore have one briefing room per ship section, and one briefing
room for every 20 fighter or bomber crew.

Hangar: Hangar: Normally, when a small craft is included in the design of a
larger one, it is installed into a form–fitting enclosure in the hull of
the mother vessel. The scout’s air/raft, for example, is carried in a
small compartment in the forward section, with barely enough room
for passengers to scramble on board. Most repairs and maintenance
require the air/raft to be launched first.

Adding a full–scale hangar allows for repairs and maintenance of
the small craft when they are back on the ship. The hangar includes
spare parts and specialized testing and repair equipment for the
stored craft.

A hangar requires 30% of the space allocated to the small craft, and
costs MCr 0.2/ton.

For example, carrying a modular cutter normally takes up 50 tons
of space. If it is given a full hangar, then it requires 65 tons of space
instead.

Launch tubes: Launch tubes: Launching and recovering small craft from a larger
vessel is usually an activity taking 30 minutes to launch or recovery
one craft. Launch tubes allow small craft to be launched and
recovered rapidly from a ship. The size of a launch tube is twenty–
five times the tonnage of the largest craft that will be deployed in

###### SPACECRAFT OPTIONS SSPACECRAFTPACECRAFT O OPTIONSPTIONS

this manner, and they cost MCr 0.5/ton. With a launch tube, up to
ten small craft can be launched per round. Multiple launch tubes
can be installed.

Laboratory: Laboratory: Space allocated to laboratories can be used for research
and experimentation. Each four tons of lab space allows for one
scientist to perform research on board ship. The cost for research
equipment varies depending on the type of research undertaken,
but is generally around MCr 1.0 per 4 tons.

Library: Library: A library room contains computer files as well as lecterns,
display screens, holotanks and even hard copies of books. A good
library is useful for both research and passing time in jump space.
Having a library on board a ship gives one extra week of training
time for new skills per week spent in jump space.

Vault: Vault: A vault is a special armored chamber in the heart of a
spacecraft, designed to survive attacks that would annihilate
the rest of the ship. A vault has another four Hull and Structure
points that only come into play when the ship housing the vault
is destroyed. A vault can contain cargo, staterooms or any other
internal components equivalent up to 6 tons.

#### WEAPONS

Changes to Core Rule Book
The following amendments are made to the core rule book:

- Pulse lasers inflict 2d6 damage and have a –2DM to hit and
    beam lasers inflict 1d6 damage. Beam lasers become available
    at TL9.
- Missiles are capable of thrust 10, with the turns to impact on
    page 147 halved (rounded up). However, missiles have limited
    endurance of 60 minutes (10 turns) before they run out of fuel.
- Sandcaster munitions can be constructed with at TL5 allowing
    low tech worlds to supply some of a navy’s munitions.
- Meson screens reduce radiation damage from meson guns and
    meson flicker weapons. Radiation hits from these weapons
    suffer a –DM equal to twice the active number of screens
- No launcher includes ammunition in its purchase cost. Missiles,
    torpedoes and so forth must be purchased separately.

###### SSPACECRAFTPACECRAFT O OPTIONSPTIONS SPACECRAFT OPTIONS

Advanced Rules for Weapon Bays on Non–

Capital Ships

- Standard spacecraft and small craft can always carry one bay
    but the maximum number is limited by displacement/1000,
    multiplied by the power plant rating number (rounded down,
    but with a minimum of one). _For example, a 2,000 ton ship with_
    _a type N power plant (rating of 2) would be able to support a_
    _maximum of 4 bays._
- Meson bays can only be fitted in ships with power plant rating
    of 5+. Fusion and particle bays can only be fitted in ships with
    a power plant rating of 3+. There are no limits on the fitting of
    non–energy weapons, lasers and railguns. If the power plant
    rating is 3 or 4 a maximum of 50% of turret weapons can be
    particle beams. If the power plant rating is 1 or 2, a maximum
    of 25% of turret weapons can be particle beams.

New Weapon Mounts
Barbettes: Barbettes: Barbettes are a weapon mount half–way between turrets
and bays. A barbette takes up a turret hardpoint, and uses the
Gunner (turrets) skill, but also takes up space inside the ship, as
the larger weapons mounted in a barbette need room for capacitors,
targeting mechanisms, ammo feeds and other components.

Large Bay: Large Bay: Large bays are hundred–ton bay weapons, used only
on larger warships. They cost twice as much a 50 ton bay. The
characteristics of large bays for the bays in the core rule book are
as follows:

WeaponWeapon TLTL RangeRange DamageDamage Cost (MCr)Cost (MCr)

Particle Beam 8 Long 9d6 + crew hit 40
Fusion Gun 12 Medium 8d6 + crew hit 16
Meson Gun 11 Long 8d6 + crew hit 100

Missiles
Long Range Missile: Long Range Missile: Long range missiles have a smaller warhead to
allow them to carry larger engines and travel faster. A long–range
missile travels as follows:

RangeRange Turns to ImpactTurns to Impact
Adjacent –
Close –
Short 1
Medium 1
Long 1
Very Long 2
Distant 3

A long range missile only deals 1d6–1 damage instead of 1d6. It
travels at thrust 15 and has an endurance of 7 turns.

Multi–warhead Missile: Multi–warhead Missile: Multi–warhead missiles carry a payload of
several warheads. The downside is that the larger payload slows the
missile, so it takes longer to reach its target.

RangeRange Turns to ImpactTurns to Impact
Adjacent –
Close –
Short 1
Medium 1

A multi–warhead missile that hits its target deals 1d6 damage 1d6
times. It travels at thrust 8 and has an endurance of 10 turns.
Torpedo Weapons
Torpedo Barbette: Torpedo Barbette: Torpedoes are heavy anti–ship missiles (and

Missile Types:
Shockwave Missile: Shockwave Missile: These missiles carry a special magnetic–
pulse warhead. The blast is harmless to spacecraft, but it
scatters and polarises sand clouds, making them useless. A ship
struck by a shockwave missile cannot use sand for the rest of
this turn.

Ortillery Missile: Ortillery Missile: Ortillery missiles are specially designed for
planetary bombardment. They are too slow to be used as anti–
ship weapons except at Close or Adjacent range.

Missile TypeMissile Type TLTL Cost per 12 missiles (Cr.)Cost per 12 missiles (Cr.)
Shockwave 7 35,000
Ortillery 7 25,000

some navies often refer to them as heavy missiles). Each torpedo
carries tremendous destructive force. They can be defended against
using standard anti–missile countermeasures. A torpedo barbette
fires one torpedo per round, using the normal rules. A torpedo
barbette can fit no other weapon. A torpedo barbette costs MCr 4,
taking up five tons of space and does not include any ammunition

Torpedo Bay:Torpedo Bay: The 50 ton version fires three torpedoes at a time.
Otherwise this weapon performs as a normal torpedo launcher. The
100 ton torpedo bay fires six torpedoes at a time.

Railguns
Railguns are huge gauss weapons, using a coil of electromagnets to
accelerate ferrous projectiles to great speed. Railguns are of limited
use in starship combat, but do have some tactical advantages, as it
is very difficult to counter a slug of metal flying towards you at great
speed. Railguns can only be used at Short range or less.

###### SPACECRAFT OPTIONS SPACECRAFT OPTIONS

Railgun Barbette: Railgun Barbette: A barbette railgun takes up five tons of space,
includes space for 20 shots of ammunition and deals 3d6 damage
on a successful attack. Each ton of railgun ammo contains twenty
shots and costs Cr 1,000.

Railgun Bay: Railgun Bay: A 50 ton railgun bay consists of multiple linked railguns.
It always fires in full auto mode, has Autofire 8 and includes space
for 200 shots of ammuntion. The railgun bay deals 3d6 damage on
each successful hit. The 100 ton version of the railgun bay is as the
50 ton bay version except it has Autofire 12 and includes space for
400 shots of ammunition.

Ortillery Railgun: Ortillery Railgun: This variation on the standard 50 ton railgun bay
is also known as a mass driver. It fires larger projectiles at slower
speeds that are optimized for smashing planetary targets. The bay
includes space for 10 shots of ammunition. A single hit from an

Torpedo Types:
Each torpedo takes up two and half tons of space. They are
normally purchased in two–shot loads of five tons each. A
barbette holds two torpedoes.

Basic: Basic: The basic torpedo consists of a small but powerful engine,
guidance computers, and a fragmentation device for kinetic–kill
attacks. It deals 4d6 damage on a successful hit.

Nuclear: Nuclear: Nuclear torpedoes deal 6d6 damage, as well as an
automatic radiation crew hit.

Bomb–Pumped Laser: Bomb–Pumped Laser: A bomb–pumped laser torpedo is a one–
shot laser weapon. The torpedo contains a small nuclear device
that is detonated prior to impact to charge a laser. The explosion
destroys the torpedo, but also generates a powerful x–ray laser
burst. The bomb–pumped laser is a normal laser attack, but
deals 6d6 damage. The basic roll to hit is as a missile, but is
defended against as a laser. Point defence can be used, but
suffers a –2DM due to the fact the bomb–pumped laser can be
used in a stand–off role.

Ortillery: Ortillery: Heavy ortillery torpedoes are used for bombing fortified
positions. They deal 8d6 damage, but are much too slow to be
effective in space combat. They move at the same speed as a
multi–warhead missile. Attacks made with an Ortillery Torpedo
have a –2DM to hit, and Point Defence attacks against the
torpedo have a +2DM.

Torpedo TypeTorpedo Type TLTL DamageDamage Cost per torpedo (Cr.)Cost per torpedo (Cr.)
Basic 7 4d6 5,000
Nuclear 7 6d6 15,000
Bomb-Pumped 9 6d6 18,000
Ortillery 8 8d6 12,000

ortillery railgun is like a tactical nuclear strike, but attacks against
mobile ground targets with an ortillery railgun suffer a –4 DM. Each
ton of ortillery railgun contains two shots.

Particle Weapons
Particle Beam Barbette: Particle Beam Barbette: A particle beam barbette works just like
a smaller particle beam turret, but inflicts 4d6 damage instead. It
takes up five tons of space.

Meson Weapons
Meson Flicker: Meson Flicker: A meson flicker 50 and 100 ton bay weapons work
like a meson gun, but fires multiple pulses instead of a single meson
blast. The meson flicker’s weaker pulses do no structural damage
but inflict considerable radiation hits to the crew.

Point Defence
Sandcaster launchers are remarkably flexible weapons, capable
of carrying different payloads. All sandcaster ammo is stored in
standard drums.

Chaff: Chaff: Sandcaster chaff disrupts sensors and communications
within the chaff cloud. All Comms, Sensors, Remote Operations or
missile attack rolls within a chaff cloud suffer a –1 DM. Chaff clouds
can be fired at any target within Close range. They do not provide
protection against laser fire.

###### SSPACECRAFTPACECRAFT O OPTIONSPTIONS SPACECRAFT OPTIONS

Pebbles: Pebbles: Pebble canisters are designed as basic offensive rounds for
a sandcaster. Pebble round canisters allow the sandcaster to deal
1d3 damage instead of one damage when used as an attack. They do
not provide protection against laser fire.

Sandcutter: Sandcutter: Sandcutter rounds fire a hail of electromagnets into
the midst of an enemy sand cloud. These magnets cause the sand
to coagulate, reducing the effective protection. A successful use of
a sandcutter shot halves the protection offered by a sand cloud.
Sandcutters are usually fired in concert with a beam attack. They do
not provide protection against laser fire.

Sandcasters are as effective as lasers as long as the missile it is
defending against is fired from at least medium range.

Screens
The number of active screens a spacecraft can support is limited to
the power plant divided by 2, rounded up. Small craft can not carry
screens. Screens onboard a ship are divided into groups during
the design process. The largest group is the primary and another
other groups are back ups. The number of screen in each group is
limited as above. Screens in each group combine their effect to give
multiple dice rolls.

_For example a spacecraft with a power plant performance rating of 4
has 3 nuclear dampers and 2 black globe generators. Due to the size of
the power plant the maximum number of screens in each group is 2. The
designer chooses to split the nuclear dampers into groups of 2 (which is
the primary screen) and 1 (redundant). The primary nuclear damper
reduces fusion gun and nuclear missile damage by 4d6 and removes the
automatic crew hit from these weapons. The black globes are in a single
group of 2, enabling a flicker rate of 20% to be maintained._

Black Globe Generator
Black Globe generators project an energy–absorbing barrier which
shunts any energy that impinges upon it into the ship’s on–

board capacitors. Any ship using a Black Globe generator cannot
maneuver, dodge, jump or use weapons or sensors whilst the
globe is active. All energy levelled at a Black Globe using vessel is
absorbed, irrespective of its type.

Black Globe generators are only available at TL15 and are currently
not commercially available. These are either recovered artefacts
of the Ancients or exotic (and not necessarily reliable) prototypes
and are generally installed either as makeshift defences or as
experimental screens on Imperial capital warships. These items
are therefore the jealously guarded property of governments and
empires and cannot be bought on the open market. The Referee
always has final discretion on Black Globe availability. Black Globe
generators require 50 tons and when available cost MCr 100.

As a ship using a Black Globe is unable to move or even see out, the
device has considerable limitations. These are offset by the capability
to flicker the Globe (switching the field off and on hundreds of times
per second) thereby giving the ship intermittent protection whilst
allowing manoeuvring, sensor use, and so forth to take place in the
periods when the globe is switched off. The maximum flicker rating
is determined by its screen rating in accordance with the following
table.

Active Black Globe generatorsActive Black Globe generators Maximum Flicker RateMaximum Flicker Rate
1 10%
2 30%
3 40%
4 60%
5 70%
6 90%

Each 10% of flicker acts as 2 points of armor against all weapons
(including meson weapons). It is important to note that this affects
both inbound and outbound fire.

absorb the incoming energy if it is to avoid overloading its systems
and exploding catastrophically. Vessels equipped with jump,
teleport and hyperspace drives have a considerable built in capacitor
capability. Additional capacitors can be fitted, particularly for those
ships without these drive systems. A suitable drive system will have
20% of its size consisting of capacitors. Additional capacitors can be
added at a cost of MCr3 per ton.

Each ton of capacitor will absorb 36 points of energy.

A ship’s ability to use its maneuver drive is also affected by the
use of the black globe. Reduce the maximum thrust available by
the flicker rating (round to nearest whole number, with 0.5 rounded
down). For example a ship has a maximum thrust of 4. It is operating
a black globe at a flicker rate of 20%. Maximum thrust is reduced by
4 x 0.2 = 0.8, rounded to 1. Maximum thrust is now 3.

As the energy striking the Black Globe is channelled to the ship’s
capacitors, the ship must have sufficient capacitor capacity to

###### SSPACECRAFTPACECRAFT O OPTIONSPTIONS SPACECRAFT OPTIONS

When the Globe is in flicker mode, a proportion of the energy equal
to the flicker rate is absorbed and channelled to the capacitors. If the
Globe is fully switched on, all the energy is absorbed and channelled
to the capacitors. In capital ship barrage combat the amount of
energy transferred to the Globe is based on the damage inflicted
before the effect of the equivalent armor is taken into account. The
amount of energy a particular weapon transfers depends on its type
and is detailed in the table below. _For example, a 30,000 ton Jump–
4 ship with has 4,000 tons of capacitors (3,000 tons integral to the
jump drive and 1,000 tons of additional capacitors) providing 144,000
points of energy storage has a Black Globe operating at 20% flicker. It
is fired on by 200 nuclear missiles. The adjusted dice roll (with the black
globe taken into account) is 2 resulting in no hits. The adjusted dice
roll (without the black globe taken into account) is 6 (125%). Hence
the energy value of the missiles hitting the black globe is (200 x 1.25 x
50) 125,000, leaving only space for 19,000 more points of energy until
overload occurs._

If a Black Globe absorbs energy and the ship’s capacitors are
full, then the ship explodes. It is therefore paramount that energy
be discharged regularly to avoid catastrophe. This can be done
by channelling the energy into the ship’s own, internal energy
requirements. However, the Black Globe must be switched off, and
during a combat round the ship can only discharge energy equal to
(0.01 x ship tonnage x power plant rating) points of energy, minus
10% for every 10% of flicker rate of the Black Globe screen. _For
example, the above 30,000 ton ship has a power plant rating of 5. With
its Black Globe operating at 20%. It can discharge (0.01 x 30,000 x 5 x
0.8 =) 1,200 energy points a turn._

Any ship that has its Black Globe permanently switched on and with
zero flicker is effectively rendered invisible. This offers significant
opportunities if done outside the range of sensors. However this
advantage is very limited under battle conditions: any ship that
turns on its Black Globe and suddenly vanishes from sensor view
can immediately have its vector plotted accurately. And, because
the ship cannot move, the vector prediction will always be correct.
All weapons will automatically hit the target and if using the barrage
fire rules, a +6 DM (simple) is used by the firing ship.

#### PRIMITIVE & ADVANCED SPACECRAFT

The Traveller core rulebook gives rules for building spacecraft as
they are built in most shipyards across the Imperium – a mix of
common off–the–shelf components, lowest–contractor–offer hulls,
and electronics imported from high–tech or industrial worlds across
the subsector. The overall tech level of the resulting spacecraft is
roughly TL12, regardless of where it was built. Many techniques
and components are standardised across the Imperium. That said,
characters may wish to purchase cutting–edge ships using the latest
in advanced materials and technologies. Isolated or interdicted
worlds may construct their own vessels without importing
components from outside. Explorers may run into Ancient derelicts
or warships built by primitive species.

Most technologies are developed one or more technology levels
before they become common, and are refined for one or more
technology levels after before they are abandoned in favor of
the next step in design. For example, the standard Pulse laser is
developed at TL7. Primitive prototypes become available at TL6,
while the design is refined until TL8 or even later, at which time
weapons research moves to particle weapons.

There is a 5% price discount per TL for older technology devices
if bought new at the source, to a maximum of –30%. Characters
can buy second–hand outdated technology for a fraction of the price
(10% to 75%, depending on condition and usability). For example,
a character buying a new TL8 engine at a TL10 world gets a 10%
discount. A character buying TL8 engines from a scrapyard could
pick them up for 50% of their original cost.

Hulls
Low Technology Hulls Low Technology Hulls are not as space–worthy as standard hulls,
and use lower–grade material. They have lower Hull and Structure
values.

High Technology Hulls High Technology Hulls are constructed using new materials
according to the most advanced naval architecture designs, making
them stronger.

The Hull Per row determines how many Hull and Structure points a spacecraft will have at that technology level. Normally, a ship has one
Hull point and one Structure point per 50 tons. At higher technology levels, a ship can have more Hull and Structure for its tonnage.

For example, a Jump–2 drive becomes commonly available at TL11.
Prototype versions are available at TL10, but cost 50% more and are
twice as big. A character who wants to buy a Jump–2 drive using the
most advanced technology available would pay twice as much as
normal, but the drive would be 25% smaller.

Power Plants
Fusion power has been in use in the Imperium for centuries, and
has been refined constantly over this time. Fusion power becomes
available at TL8 and remains in use until TL15. Most power plants in
use in starships are TL12–14, but it is possible to use more primitive
or advanced power plants.

Instead of decreasing the tonnage of the weapon or screen, it is
possible to select upgrades for a higher–technology weapon
or screen. One upgrade may be added per extra Tech Level. For
example, a TL10 Particle Bay could contain two upgrades, or have
its tonnage decreased to 90%, or contain one upgrade and have its
tonnage decreased to 95%.

Some upgrades are double upgrades, consuming two ‘slots’. An
upgrade may only be taken once.

Accurate (Double Upgrade): Accurate (Double Upgrade): Accurate weapons have a +1 DM to all
attack rolls (not applicable to screens). In capital ship combat, if all
the weapons firing in the barrage are accurate, a +1 DM is used on
the attack roll.

Easy to Repair: Easy to Repair: Easy to Repair armaments give a +1 DM to all repair
attempts in spacecraft and capital ship combat.

High Yield: High Yield: When rolling damage for a High Yield weapon or
performance of a high yield screen, any ‘1’s rolled on the dice are
counted as ‘2’s. For example, a roll of 1, 1, 2 on a High Yield Particle
Beam attack would deal 6 damage, as the two ‘1’s become two ‘2’s.
In capital ship combat, if all the weapons firing in the barrage have
high yield, a +1 DM is used on the attack roll. High yield screens
have no effect in capital ship combat

Long Range: Long Range: The optimum range for the weapon is increased by one
band. For example, a Pulse Laser has an Optimum range of Short. A
Long Range Pulse Laser has an Optimum range of Medium instead
(not applicable to screens)

Resilient (Double Upgrade): Resilient (Double Upgrade): The first hit on a Resilient weapon is
ignored. This only applies in capital ship combat if all the weapons
of that type in that section are resilient.

Variable Range (Double Upgrade): Variable Range (Double Upgrade): A Variable Range weapon
increases its Optimum Range by one band in either direction. For
example, a Pulse Laser has an Optimum range of Short. A Variable
Range Pulse Laser has an Optimum Range of Close–Medium (not
applicable to screens)

Very High Yield (Double Upgrade): Very High Yield (Double Upgrade): When rolling damage for a Very
High Yield weapon, any ‘1’s or ‘2’s rolled on the dice are counted as
‘3’s. For example, a roll of 1, 1, 2 on a Very High Yield Particle Beam
attack would deal 9 damage, as all the dice are below the threshold
and become ‘3’s. In capital ship combat, if all the weapons firing in
the barrage have high yield, a +2 DM is used on the attack roll. Very
high yield screens have no effect in capital ship combat

the wreckage and tag it for retrieval.

A salvage drone may make a Mechanic check each round of space combat in order to retrieve salvageable parts of one system that has
not been destroyed on the wrecked ship. The Mechanic check suffers a –2 DM per hit on the system. If the system can be salvaged, it is
generally worth 10–60% of its original cost.

#### CONSTRUCTION TIME

Whilst standard civilian ships are built at a rate of 1 week per MCr 5.0 cost (see Core Rulebook page 105), the construction times for bespoke
and particularly military designs is as follows and is based on their displacement:

The first number is for the first ship of that class built in that yard and the second number is for subsequent ships.

Configuration
A small craft may have any of three configurations – standard (a
wedge, cone, sphere or cylinder), streamlined (a wing, disc or
other lifting body allowing it to enter the atmosphere easily), or
distributed (made up of several sections, and incapable of entering
an atmosphere or maintaining its shape under gravity).

Streamlining a small craft increases the cost of the hull by 10%.

A distributed small craft reduces the cost of its hull by 10%.

A standard–hull small craft may still enter atmosphere, but is
very ungainly and ponderous, capable of only non–lift generating
powered flight.

Armor
The basic hull provides some protection from anti–ship weapons
fire, but it is possible to add heavier armor to the hull for added
defence. There are practicable limitations on the amount of armor
that can be added to a spacecraft due to the technology level of the
metallurgy. This is defined by the following table:

## SSMALLMALL CRAFTCRAFT D DESIGNESIGN

Definitions
A small craft is any ship from 10 to 99 tons. Small craft cannot
use jump engines. Ships are measured in ‘displacement tons’
or d–tons: a hundred–ton ship displaces a volume equal to one
hundred tons of liquid hydrogen (one d–ton equals roughly 14
cubic meters).

A fighter is a small, short–ranged fast combat vessel, normally
displacing less than fifty tons.
A bomber is a heavier combat vessel, equipped with weapons
that are capable of damaging a capital ship.
A torpedo boat is a special variety of bomber equipped with
torpedoes.
A boat is a small long–range craft, designed for independent
operations.
A shuttle is a large cargo carrier, usually used to transfer cargo
from orbit to surface.

Maneuver Drives
A small craft cannot be equipped with a Jump Drive. It can be equipped
with a Gravitic or Reaction M–Drive or a solar sail

- A Gravitic drive is a smaller version of the drive plates used by
    larger spacecraft, and propels the craft using artificial gravity.
- A Reaction drive is a rocket. Reaction drives are cheaper and
    smaller than Gravitic Drives, but burn fuel much more quickly and
    are less efficient.
- A Solar Sail is large, up to several kilometers across, made of a
    flex flexible synthetic fabric that has limited self–repair capabilities.
    Particles emitted by the sun – the ‘solar wind’ catch the sail and
    provide a minuscule amount of thrust. A ship using a solar sail as
    its primary method of propulsion has a Thrust of 0 and requires
    several days or weeks to change its course or speed. A solar sail
    costs 0.01 MCr per ton of ship, and takes up 5% of the ship’s total
    tonnage when stowed.

Power
Like a larger spacecraft, a small craft must have a power source. There
are four standard options.

- Fusion power plants are the most common power source used
    throughout the Imperium.
- Chemical plants use petrochemical or synthetic fuels Chemical
    plant fuel can not be skimmed from gas giants or taken from water
    sources and can not be used by rocket motors..
- Chemical batteries storing electrical energy. Eventually they need
    to be recharged
- Solar Panels. Extendable panels provides power, as a backup to
    a chemical or fusion plant, as a recharging source for chemical
    batteries or, if the power required is very low, as an independent
    power source.

Chemical Batteries: Chemical Batteries: The sizes of chemical batteries are based on the
power plant required to deliver a performance rating of 1. A chemical
battery the same size as a fusion power plant of the same tech level will
provide 1000 hours of use assuming the vessel is not manoeuvring,
using active sensors, refining fuel, making significant use of long range
communicators or energy using weapons (such as lasers, rail guns,
meson guns, fusion guns and particle beams). Alternatively, the same
sized battery will give 1 hour of performance without these restrictions.
A battery can be scaled in size to give any endurance and costs 4 times
the equivalent fusion power plant. A TL7 battery is the same size as a
TL 8 battery. For example, a sB battery with 2000 hours of endurance will
require (1 x 2000/1000) 2 tons and cost MCr (2 x 2000/1000 x 4) 16. The
time to recharge a battery is equivalent to the battery endurance used
(in low power setting) divided by 1000 divided by the power plant rating
multiplied by 2. If using solar panels to recharge the battery, the “power
plant rating” is 0.1. For example the battery described above has been used
for 1600 hours. To recharge it with solar panels will require (1600 /1000/0.1
x2) 32 hours.

Solar Panel: Solar Panel: The size of solar panels required to power a ship is 1/10th
that of the main power plant. If the panels are fitted to a ship without
a chemical or fusion power plant, then assume the (non–existent)
main power plant is sized to deliver a performance rating of 1. A craft
equipped with solar panels consumes power plant fuel at one–quarter
the normal rate as long as it is only engaged in minimal manoeuvring
and does not fire weapons. Minimal manoeuvring does not include long
periods at full thrust. Solar panels cost 0.1MCr/ton. No power plant fuel
is consumed, and endurance is considered as infinite, if the ship is not
manoeuvring, using active sensors or refining fuel for use.

Hulls vary in their requirements for drives and power plants based on tonnage. The drive potential table lists 24 small craft drive types,
identified by the letters sA through sZ (omitting I and O to avoid confusion). Also listed are various tonnage levels for hulls; any tonnage
which exceeds a listed level should be read at the next higher level. Correlating hull size with drive letter indicates drive potential. If a — is
listed, then that combination of drive and hull will result in a vessel with insufficient power or overpowered.

- For maneuver drives, this potential is the Thrust number (Tn), which is the number of Gs acceleration available.
- For power plants, it is power plant rating (Pn).

The power plant rating must be at least equal to the maneuver drive rating for gravitic M–Drives. For reaction M–Drives, the power plant
rating must be at least 1.

Fuel
Total fuel tankage for a ship must be indicated in the design plans. There is no cost, but the capacity does influence how often the ship must
refuel. All fuel requirements assume two weeks of operation.

Gravitic drives Gravitic drives do not require fuel.

Reaction drives Reaction drives require fuel. The required fuel is a percentage of craft displacement equal to 2.5% per thrust hour. So to thrust a craft at 4G
for 2 hours requires 8G–hours of fuel, which corresponds to 20% of the craft dedicated to fuel. In ship combat, there are 10 turns in an hour
so multiply the number of G–hours by 10 to give the duration number of G–turns a ship can thrust for. Each point of thrust spent reduced
the fuel reserve by an equivalent number of G/turns.

Fusion power plant fuelFusion power plant fuel is tied directly to the power plant letter (and assumes a 2 week operation period):

Small Craft & Fuel Requirements
Small craft often do not need to function for two weeks of
independent operations. A surface to orbit shuttle or a fighter
might only need to carry enough fuel for a few hours of flight.

Three days 25%

For example, a modular cutter with a type sK power plant requires
two tons of fuel for two weeks of operation. If it only requires one
week of operation, then it requires only one ton of fuel.

A high–power fighter with an sF power plant requires 1.5 tons of
fuel for two weeks of operation. However, the fighter needs only to
operate for six hours before refuelling, so it only needs 2% of this fuel,
or 0.03 tons of fuel.

###### SSMALLMALL C CRAFTRAFT D DESIGNESIGN SMALL CRAFT DESIGN

When not using active sensors, weapons or more than occasional
use of very long communication, craft with chemical power plants
halve their fuel consumption. For example, normally a 90 ton
shuttle with a chemical power plant (rating sE), would require 25
tons of fuel for 2 weeks endurance. However, as it does not need
active sensors except when docking, will rarely use weapons or very
long range communicators, 12.5 tons will be sufficient for 2 weeks
endurance.

If you are reducing power plant fuel to a number of hours, endurance
will be important, so multiply the number of hours of fuel by 10 to
give the number of turns of operation at full power.

#### THE MAIN COMPARTMENT

Cockpit or Control Cabin
All craft must have a either a cockpit or a control cabin containing
basic controls, communications equipment, avionics, scanners,
detectors, sensors, and other equipment for proper operation of
the ship. A cockpit is much more cramped and uncomfortable,
but takes up less tonnage. No extra passengers can be carried in a
cockpit; a control cabin allows for half as many passengers as crew
to be carried. The cost for a cabin or cockpit is the same – MCr 0.1
per 20 tons of ship.

A cockpit takes up 1.5 tons per crewman; a cabin takes up three
tons per crewman. The cockpit or control cabin includes a basic
electronics suite. More advanced electronics suites can be installed
(as per the rules for starship electronic suites).

Small Craft Crews
The minimum number of crew for a small craft depends on its size.

TonnageTonnage Minimum CrewMinimum Crew
10–50 1
60–100 2

A craft may carry extra crewmen, often as gunners, sensor operators, cargo masters or navigators.

Drones
It is possible to equip small craft as drones. At lower technology levels this is little more than making the craft remote control. However,
at higher technology levels it is possible to provide the drone with a true autonomous capability. Such autonomous craft are typically not
as skilled as their flesh and blood equivalents but they do provide navies with limited numbers of trained personnel, or crew prone to
claustrophobia (such as the K’Kree), with the option of deploying combat small craft. Remote operation mode is sensitive to electronic
warfare and if within short range of a vessel, that vessel may use electronic warfare (see Core Rulebook page 150) as if the drone was a
smart missile to temporarily jam transmission between the mother ship and the drone.

A drone command unit takes up 1.5 tons per required crew equivalent and includes a basic electronics suite.

A small craft drone operating in autonomous mode is effectively a robot with a range of specialist intellect and expert programs (see
Core Rule Book pages 92–94). The characteristics and skills of an autonomous mode drone depend on its tech level, noting that all skills
requiring physical characteristics used Intelligence instead.

###### SMALL CRAFT DESIGN SSMALLMALL C CRAFTRAFT D DESIGNESIGN

Airlock
Unlike starships, a small craft does not have an airlock by default.
Airlocks take up one ton each and cost MCr 0.2. If a craft does not
have an airlock, then the crew cannot leave the craft except when it
is landed or in a pressurised landing bay without opening the ship
up to vacuum.

Cabin Space
Adding cabin space gives the crew more space to move around and
to access other components of the ship, such as the engines or cargo
bay. Every 1.5 tons of cabin space allows the craft to carry another
passenger in moderate comfort (although passenger shuttles
will customarily take Luxuries to upgrade the passenger section).
Designating a section as cabin space costs MCr 0.05 per ton.

Other Components
A small craft may have any of the components allowed to larger
vessels.

#### ARMAMENTS

The number of weapons allowable depends on the size of craft.
Weapons are divided into two categories – ship weapons and
anti–personnel weapons. Anti–personnel weapons like FGMPs or
rocket launchers are too short–ranged and low–powered to be of
use against spacecraft.

One ton of fire control equipment must be installed for each turret
or fixed mount (see page 111 of the Traveller main rulebook). Anti–
personnel weapons do not need to be placed in turrets – instead,
they are mounted on the external surface of the craft. One turret is
required per three weapons carried.

Ship weapon types are limited. Rapid fire mounts may not be fitted.
Barbette Particle beams can be fitted but use the equivalent of two
ship weapons (and a turret). Torpedo barbettes can not be fitted but
individual torpedoes can be carried. Each torpedo displaces 2.5 tons
and uses a ship weapon slot.

The number of particle beams is limited as per the expanded space
craft rules.

Meson, particle beam and fusion bays can not be fitted.

The armaments allowed to a small craft are further restricted by its
power plant type. It may only equip up to the number of ship–scale
lasers and, particle weapons – allowed by the following table. The
number of missile launchers or projectile weapons is not limited by
the power plant letter.

Particle beam barbettes are the equivalent of 2 energy weapons
each.

For example, a 70–ton ship has a Class H power plant. It may install
up to three ship–scale weapons, but a maximum of one of these can be
energy weapons.

###### CAPITAL SHIP DESIGN

#### THE HULL

Capital ships range between 2,001 and 1,000,000 tons, and are
designated by Hull Code. A Hull Code includes all hull values
between it and the next lowest hull code (so a 28,000 ton ship will
have a Hull Code of CK).

The base cost of a hull is MCr. 0.1 per ton, plus a modifier based on
the Hull Configuration.

Configuration
A capital ship may have any of several configurations. Unlike
a smaller vessel, the configuration of a capital ship’s hull is very
important, as it determines what proportion of a ship’s weapons
can be brought to bear on a target in any round and what weapons
are permitted.

###### CCAPITALAPITAL S SHIPHIP D DESIGNESIGN

Planetoid and Buffered Planetoid hulls cost Cr 4000 per ton to
transport from the local planetoid belt and to drill out. Only 80% of
the volume of a planetoid hull is useable and 65% of the volume of
a buffered planetoid is useable.

A capital ship is divided into between two and six sections, depending
on its tonnage. Attacks on a ship will hit one section or another.
One section is always the Engineering section; sample names are
given for different sections, but the section should be named when
components are allocated to it (see page 68).

Armor
The basic hull provides some protection from anti–ship weapons
fire, but it is possible to add heavier armor to the hull for added
defence.

Armor can be allocated on a per–section basis, in which case the
cost is determined as if the two differently armored sections of the
ship were different vessels of the appropriate size. Armor does not
need to be added in 5% elements, but it must be added in whole
point values.

Dispersed structure ships can not be armored.

Planetoids and Buffered Planetoids have integral armor of 2 and
4 points respectively. They may be additionally armored as if they
were a close structure vessel, but with the base hull already paid
for. The maximum armor of a planetoid is 2 plus the limit from the
technology or tech level of the armor. The maximum armor of a
buffered planetoid is 4 plus the limit from the technology or tech
level of the armor.

_Example: A 20,000 ton planetoid is additionally armored over all
sections with a further 8 points of crystaliron armor to a total level
of 10. This extra armor uses 2,000 tons of volume (10% of the hull
volume) and costs 20,000 x (MCr 0.1 x 90%) x 20% for a total of
MCr 360._

Drives
Hulls vary in their requirements for drives and power plants based
on tonnage. Any specific drive will be less efficient as the tonnage it
must drive increases. To determine the tonnage of the drive required,
consult the drive potential table, which gives the percentage of the
ship’s total tonnage that must be allocated to the drive to give the
designed Thrust or Jump.

###### CAPITAL SHIP DESIGN CAPITAL SHIP DESIGN

Hull & Structure
Like other starships, capital ships have one Hull Point and one
Structure Point per 50 tons of displacement. However, as capital
ships are so vast, these Hull and Structure points are divided into
several groups, each group representing one section of the ship.
If any section of the ship is reduced to zero Structure, the ship is
destroyed.

each screen group the ship can carry. There is no limitation on the
number of redundant screens fitted.

For example a 60,000 ton TL 15 ship with power plant rating of 5
may have up to 300 bay weapons and a spinal mount. Each of its
screens groups can have up to 5 meson screens, 5 nuclear dampers
or 3 black globe generators.

Fuel
Total fuel tankage for a ship must be indicated in the design plans.
There is no cost, but the capacity does influence how often the ship
must refuel.

Maneuver Drive fuel is only needed if a reaction drive is fitted. The
amount of fuel required is determined as the percentage of ship
displacement = 2.5 per thrust hour. For example a ship capable of 2
hours of thrust at 4G requires 2 x 4 x 2.5% = 20% of displacement
as reaction drive fuel. As space combat turns are 6 minutes long,
each hour of fuel gives 10 turns of operation at maximum thrust.
The total reserve of fuel available is expressed as a number of thrust
points. In the above example, the ship has (4G x 2 hours) = 8 G/
Hours of thrust in the fuel reserve. This is converted to thrust points
by multiplying by 10, giving a fuel reserve of 80 Thrust Points, with a
maximum spend equal to the drive performance. Each thrust point
spent reduces the reserve remaining in the tank, and a ship cannot
maneuver when this fuel is spent.

Jump Drive fuel Jump Drive fuel depends on the size of the ship and the length of
the Jump, and is calculated as 0.1 x tonnage x Jump Number, and
allows one Jump of the stated level.

Power plant fuel Power plant fuel depends on the tonnage of the plant. For fusion
plants an amount of fuel equal to two thirds of the tonnage of the
power plant will power the starship for two weeks. For example, a
3,000–ton power plant would consume 2,000 tons of fuel in two
weeks of operation. For chemical plants, this figure is 15 times
larger.

Hyperspace Drive
Hyperdrives can be used in non-standard Traveller settings (see
Traveller main rulebook, page 109).

A hyperspace drive uses no fuel but requires double the space of
a jump drive that can travel the equivalent distance.

###### CAPITAL SHIP DESIGN CCAPITALAPITAL S SHIPHIP D DESIGNESIGN

Component Options
Unless otherwise noted, any options that are allowed for smaller
craft can be applied to Capital Ship components. For example,
a capital ship computer network can be hardened against EMP
(see Traveller, page 108) at the cost of 50% of the computer
network’s base cost.

#### THE MAIN COMPARTMENT ARMAMENTS

Capital ships can carry the same weapons as smaller craft, but in
far greater numbers. Even a small capital ship can have dozens of
turrets and bays. Capital ships can also mount weapons that are
unique to them, such as spinal weapons.

Because of the sheer number of weapons mounted on a capital ship,
it is sheer folly to track each individual turret weapon or missile
launcher. Instead, the attack potential of each type of weapon is
measured in barrages (see page 73).

Turrets and Barbettes
A capital ship can mount one turret per 100 tons not allocated to
other weapons. The standard set of turrets (single, double, triple,
pop–up and so on) is available to capital ships. One ton of fire
control equipment is required for each turret.

Bays
The number of bays that a capital ship can mount is limited by the
ship’s power plant (see above), and by the number of hardpoints.
The total number of turrets and bays cannot exceed the ship’s
tonnage divided by one hundred. One ton of fire control equipment
is required for each bay.

Point Defence
While a capital ship can mount point defence systems like
sandcasters, the effectiveness of these systems is measured by the
total point defence, not by individual systems. See page 74.

Screens
Unlike point defence weapons, which are the same for capital ships
as they are for smaller craft, defensive screens scale with the size
of the ship. A capital ship will need a larger screen generator to
protect itself. Only one screen generator needs to be installed per
ship, but extra generators can be installed as backups or to provide
a stronger screen. There is a limit on the number of screens that
may be combined together depending on the Tech Level of the
screens. The limits are:

Command
A ship requires one command module per section. Each command
module takes up 0.5% of the ship’s total tonnage and costs MCr.1
per ton of command module/bridge. One of these command
modules must be designated the ship’s bridge, but they can all use
any specialist bridge options.

Computer
Capital ships have multiple distributed computer networks, but
always include a central computer core that controls the ship’s
Jump engines. The rating of this central core depends on the Jump
range and the size of the ship. Computers are assumed to have their
tonnage included in the command modules of a ship.

The rating for the ship’s computer system is in addition to the
processing power and speed needed for Jump Control programs,
and all jump control software is included in the price of the computer
system. Other ship software must be added to this.

Sensors
Capital ships use standard sensors. However, due to the size of these
vessels, it is possible to mount multiple extended or distributed
arrays with up to one per section fitted.

###### CCAPITALAPITAL S SHIPHIP D DESIGNESIGN CAPITAL SHIP DESIGN

#### SPINAL WEAPONS

Spinal weapons are huge particle or meson weapons that run the
length of a capital ship. A single shot from a spinal weapon can cut
a lesser vessel in two.

The damage of a spinal weapon depends on the size and type of
weapon. Spinal weapon damage is measured in capital ship damage
terms. For damage to spacecraft, the damage is the barrage value in
d6. Spinal mounts use a number of hardpoints equivalent to their
tonnage divided by 100. All weapons have long range. A ship may
only have one spinal mount.

Increasing Tech Level will reduce size and cost significantly with
some improvement in performance.

Options
Rapid Fire: Rapid Fire: A rapid fire spinal weapon is equipped with capacitors
and redundant reaction chambers. It can be fired twice in a round
instead of once, but only if it does not fire at all in the following
round while the capacitors recharge. Making a rapid fire spinal
weapon increases the tonnage and the cost of the weapon by 10%.

#### COMPONENTS

Barracks
Ships that must carry large number of troops may take barracks
instead of staterooms. A barracks may only be used to carry marines
or passengers (few will willingly pay for passage in such cramped
conditions, so such passengers will be colonists or prisoners). A
barracks takes up 2 tons per marine, and costs MCr 0.1 per marine.
Barracks can only be used to accommodate troops intended for
boarding or assault operations. Troops accommodated in barracks
can not be used to reduce the number of service crew embarked
(see page 67).

Hangar
Hangars are used for storing and maintaining small craft. There are
three types:

Storage Hangars Storage Hangars have just enough space to hold the craft. To
launch or recover the craft takes ten six–minute rounds, as the craft
must be unpacked and prepared for flight. A storage hangar takes
up tonnage equal to tonnage of the stored craft plus 10% and costs
MCr 0.2 per ton.

Standard Hangars Standard Hangars are large enough to hold the craft in readiness for
a quick launch, perform reloading and all necessary maintenance. It
includes all the necessary spare pairs, tools and heavy machinery to
conduct full maintenance and repairs. A standard hangar takes up
tonnage equal to the tonnage of the small craft to be stored, plus
30% and costs MCr0.2 per ton.

Launch Tubes
Launch tubes allow for small craft to be launched and recovered
rapidly from the capital ship. The size of a launch tube is twenty–five
times the tonnage of the largest craft that will be deployed in this
manner, and they cost MCr. 0.5/ton. With a launch tube, up to ten
small craft can be launched per starship combat round. Multiple
launch tubes can be installed.

#### CREW

All starships require a crew to operate and maintain the ship. In
general, the crew of the ship must provide enough personnel to
operate all machinery and man all weaponry. The actual number of

###### CAPITAL SHIP DESIGN CCAPITALAPITAL S SHIPHIP D DESIGNESIGN

crew personnel required for the ship must be computed based on
the drives, weaponry, and other equipment carried by the ship. It is
strongly recommended that you calculate the required crew for the
vessel as each element of the ship is designed.

Command Section
The ship should have a commanding officer, an executive officer,
a computer officer, two navigation officers, a medical officer, and
a communications officer. The section should also have support
personnel, ratings equal to 50% of the total officers in the section.
On large ships (over 20,000 tons), the number of personnel in the
command section should amount to 5 per 10,000 tons of ship.

Engineering Section
The ship needs one engineering crew member for each 100 tons of
drives installed. This should include a knowledgeable chief engineer,
a second engineer, and several petty officers.

Gunnery Section
The ship should have a chief gunnery officer and at least 1 petty
officer for each type of weapon aboard. The major weapon (spinal
mount) should have a crew of 1 per 100 tons of weapon; bay
weapons should have a crew of at least 2; turret weapons should
have a crew of at least 1 per barrage. (Note this places a maximum
limit on the number of barrages a ship can shoot, which could limit
its performance against small craft. Each operational fighter or
turret drone requires at least 1 crew member.

Each screen device (force field, damper, meson screen) should have
a crew of at least 4. The gunnery section should have 10% officers,
and 30% petty officers. Personnel are drawn from the gunnery
branch and the technical services branch.

Flight Section
If the ship has any launched craft, it should have a flight control
officer, crew for each craft, and at least 1 maintenance person per
craft. Launch tubes should have a crew of at least 10, which will
include a flight supervision officer and a preponderance of petty
officers. Pilots must be officers, and maintenance personnel are
generally ratings.

In addition, if the ship has more than 3 vehicles (air/rafts, ATVs,
and so on), the flight section should include vehicle drivers and
maintenance personnel for them as well (at least 1 per 3 vehicles).

Ship's Troops
Most ships over 1,000 tons have a marine (or military) contingent
aboard which ranges in size from a squad to a regiment. Such
contingents range from 3 per 100 tons to 3 per 1,000 tons. Ship's
troops often fill the role of security forces aboard the ship, and are
used for military adventures by the commander where necessary.

Ship's troops are also used for damage control parties, manning of
some weapons, and boarding actions.

Service Crew
The ship itself may have a requirement for other sections which
provide basic services, including shops and storage, security
(especially if there are no ship's troops aboard), maintenance, food
service, and other operations. Such personnel are drawn from the
crew branch if no other appears appropriate. Allow 3 per 1000 tons
if there are no ship's troops. This can be reduced to as low as 2 crew
per 1000 tons of ship by replacing service crew with ship’s troops.

The Frozen Watch
A ship may have low berths installed (and competent medical
personnel assigned). If low berths provide enough places for a 50%
coverage in personnel (including ship's troops, if any), then the ship
has a frozen watch. Replacement personnel are kept available in low
berths for continuous replacement of casualties and battle losses;
between battles, the frozen watch can be revived and used to restore
lost crew.

If there are excess Type A components, then the excess can be placed in unoccupied Type B slots.

If there aren’t enough Type B slots, use unoccupied Type C slots.

Sometimes, not all of a ship’s components can be placed on the Section Hit Tables; if so, place the largest tonnage components first.

If there are still unfilled slots when all components have been placed, then unfilled internal slots are filled with Structure and unfilled
external slots are filled with Hull.

###### CAPITAL SHIP DESIGN CCAPITALAPITAL S SHIPHIP D DESIGNESIGN

#### CAPITAL SHIP CREWS

A capital ship can have several hundred or thousand crewmen, far
too many to keep track of individually. Instead, a capital ship crew is
measured by two characteristics:

Crew Strength: Crew Strength: The size of the crew relative to the ship is measured
on the Crew Strength scale. An understrength crew may still be able
to operate the ship, but with penalties to skill rolls or more slowly.
An overstrength crew gives no bonuses, but is able to absorb more
casualties and has a bonus during boarding actions.

Crew StrengthCrew Strength % of full crew% of full crew Skill DMSkill DM
Dead 0% – Cannot act
Survivors 1% to 10% –4 May only fire

Full 76% to 90% +0
Battle 91% to 120% +0
Overstrength 121% to 150% +0
Massively
Overstrength

151%+ +0

If a ship is noted as being able to fire once every two or more rounds,
then this applies to each individual weapon. For example, a ship
armed with a pulse laser bank, a particle beam bank, and a spinal
meson gun could fire a half–strength barrage from its pulse lasers
together with a meson gun blast. Next round, it could fire another
half strength pulse laser barrage and the particle beams, but could
not fire the other half of the pulse lasers or the meson gun again.

Crew Skill: Crew Skill: A starship crew is assumed to have average to good
Characteristics and to have mastered the following skills: Pilot,
Gunner, Discipline, Mechanic, Engineer, Sensors and Medic.
All these skills are at the level of their Crew Skill characteristic.
Obviously, some individual crewmen will have greater or lesser
skills, but the average is the Crew Skill and is used for all skill checks
made by the crew.

Crew SkillCrew Skill Skill Check DMSkill Check DM
Green +0
Average +1
Experienced +2
Elite +3
Legendary +4

A crew may have an especially skilled officer. If the officer has a skill
level of 4 or more, he gives a +1 DM to all matching skill checks. An
officer may only give a bonus to one skill roll each round, and a skill
may only benefit from one officer bonus.

For example , the gunnery officer on the Invidious is an especially skilled
gunner (Gunner (turrets) 5 levels) and a strict disciplinarian (Discipline
4). He may give a +1 DM to one Gunner or Discipline check made on
board each round. The captain also has Discipline 4, and so may give
a +1DM to one Discipline check per round. However, the two may not
combine their bonuses to give a +2DM to a Discipline check.

#### ENDURANCE

Ships are able to operate for one month without needing to go
into a spaceport for maintenance, assuming an adequate supply of
fuel. This is increased by one month for every 1% of total tonnage
dedicated to cargo. If fleet support vessels are in attendance then
another three months can be added to the time needed before
maintenance is required.

#### CAPITAL SHIP DESIGN EXAMPLE

Julia wants to design a Heavy Cruiser for the Imperial Navy. She
decides that is it should be resilient to damage, be heavily armed
and capable of high performance and capable of a range of military
operations. As it is for the Imperial Navy, she can use tech level 15
systems if she chooses to do so.

Step 1 – Choosing a Hull
For her heavy cruiser, Julia chooses a CP Hull (75,000 tons) and
a cone configuration, giving a hull cost of MCr 8,250. A 75,000
ton ship has 4 sections on the section hit table. Reviewing the
options available from the capital ship design section, the expanded
spacecraft design section and the core rulebook, Julia decides to
make the hull from TL15 materials. This increases the cost by MCr
4,125, but increases both hull and structure points from 1,500 to
2,143.

Now Julia decides to add armor. She decides on 10 points of
bonded super dense armor. This takes up (10/6 x 5%) 6,250 tons
of the ship at a cost of MCr (7,500/2 x 1.1 x 10/6) MCr 6,875.

###### CAPITAL SHIP DESIGN CAPITAL SHIP DESIGN

Step 2 – Choosing Drives
In her campaign, Imperial warships have the maximum possible
thrust and at least Jump–3 performance. As this is a cruiser
designed to operate away from the main fleet, Julia decides that the
performance should be a little better at Jump–4. Julia will fit drives
capable of 6G, which means the power plant will also be rated at 6.
She decides to have a TL15 fusion power plant.

The Jump Drive is 3,750 tons and costs MCr7,500. The Maneuver
Drive is 2,437.5 tons and costs MCr1,218.75 and the Power Plant is
(0.05x0.75x7500) 2,812.5 tons and costs MCr7,031.25.

She decides to fit armored bulkheads from the expanded ship
design section to the drive systems to improve their resistance
to damage (systems with armored bulkheads ignore the first hit
against them). These are 900 tons and cost MCr 180.

Julia chooses to work out the crew of the ship now. She decides that
she wants an over strength crew (she is worried about the effects of
radiation damage). Normally the engineering crew consists of one
person per 100 tons of engines, but Julia decides this should be 1.21
crew per 100 tons instead. As the ship has 9,000 tons of drive, she
needs (90*1.21) 109 engineering crew.

Step 3 – Fuel
Julia decides that her heavy cruiser will be capable of 1 4 parsec
jump and 4 weeks power plant endurance. Jump fuel required is
(0.4 x 75,000) 30,000 tons. Power plant fuel is (2812.5 x 2/3 x2)
3,750 tons. She chooses at this time to fit fuel scoops (MCr 1) and
a fuel processor capable of purifying all her fuel in 2 days that is
(37,500 /20 /2) 843.75 tons and costs MCr 42.1875.

Step 4 – Command
As a 4 section ship, Julia’s ship required a bridge that takes up (4
x 0.5) 2% of the ship, which is 1,500 tons and costs (1,500 x MCr1)
MCr1,500. As a possible flag ship, Julia adds a command bridge
which is (4 x 80) 320 tons and costs MCr2,250. She adds holographic
controls for (0.25 x 3,750) MCr and adds armored bulkheads for 182
tons and MCr36.4.

Julia works out the command crew now. As a ship of over 20,000
tons with an over strength crew, the cruiser’s command crew is
(75,000/10,000 x 5 x 1.21) 46.

###### CAPITAL SHIP DESIGN CCAPITALAPITAL S SHIPHIP D DESIGNESIGN

Step 5 – Computers
Julia wants a computer capable of running any software
simultaneously. She wants it hardened against radiation (fib) and
multiple sets to protect this key system from damage. She decides
on three Core/7fib computers costing (3 x 70 x 1.5) MCr315, each
running Maneuver/0 (included), Intellect, Jump Control/4
(included), Evade/3, Fire Control/5, Auto–Repair/2 and Library

Step 6 – Sensors
As her heavy cruiser will often be on independent operations,
she wants her ship to have the best possible sensors. She selects
a military countermeasures suite (20 tons MCr25) and fits both
enhanced signal processing (2 tons MCr 8) and distributed arrays
(triple the total – 66 tons MCr99). For redundancy, she fits three
sets (she could have had 4).

- Luxuries for 20 high passage (10 tons MCr1) for high ranking
    command staff, diplomats and other passengers.
- 5 Probe Drones (1 ton MCr0.5)
- Repair Drones for the ship (0.01 x 75,000) totally 750 tons and

    Small craft costs are MCr152 and require a total of 18 crew.

Julia could choose the number of escape pods and the size of the
armory but wants to wait until the rest of the ship is designed
before determining how many of these she needs.

Step 8 – Weapons
At this stage Julia reminds herself that as she has a rating 6
powerplant in her Tech Level 15 ship, she can fit level 6 screens in
each group and a maximum of (6 x 75,000/1,000) 450 bays. The
ship has 750 hardpoints.

Julia decides to fit a Meson Gun Type C at Tech Level 15. This
weapon is 4,000 tons, costs MCr4,000, inflicts 455 damage, has a
penetration rating of IV and uses 40 hardpoints. Julia has 710 left.
The spinal mount is protected with armored bulkheads using 400
tons and costing MCr80.

The following bays are fitted:

- 10 Tech Level 14 100 ton meson gun bays with accurate and
    high yield characteristics. Size remains 101 tons and each
    now costs MCr 200. Total is 1,010 tons and MCr 2,000. 700

- All the bays are fitted with armored bulkheads. This uses 349
    tons and costs MCr69.8.

For turrets, Julia fits the following:

- 80 Tech level 11 triple Particle Beam turrets with accurate and
    high yield special features. Each particle beam now costs MCr8.
    Total is 80 tons and MCr 2,000. 540 hardpoints remain.
- 240 Tech level 10 triple beam laser turrets with accurate and
    high yield special features. Each beam laser now costs MCr2.

Julia decides to work out the gunnery crew now. For basic levels, the
spinal mount requires (4000/100) 40 crew, the 90 bays require 180
crew and the 12 screens require 48 crew. She decides to provide 40
gunners for the particle beam turrets (1 per 2 turrets), 120 for the beam
laser turrets (1 per 2 turrets), 25 for the missile turrets (1 per 4 turrets)
and 20 gunners for the sandcaster turrets (1 per 10 turrets). Total
gunnery crew for 100% manning is 473. For over strength (121–150%)
manning, 573 gunnery crew are required.

Step 9 – Crew
Julia decides to embark 2 companies of marines (250). The service
crew requirements at over strength levels are (1.21*75,000*2/3) 182.
Previously calculated crew are 109 engineers, 46 command, 18 flight
and 573 gunners. Total crew is 1,178 at 121% of normal manning. Julia
decides to not have a frozen watch.

Step 10 – Accommodation and Remaining

Julia decides to carry 20 passengers. She fits a total of 44 armories (88
tons MCr22) for the crew and marines. Total stateroom requirement
is 632 (2,528 tons MCr 316) with command and passengers in single

Julia now lays out the section hit table and fully writes up the ship’s
details, which can be found on page 119.

###### CAPITAL SHIP DESIGN

#### RANGE

The accuracy of weapons depends on range, with the massive distances
involved affecting the accuracy of targeting, attenuating the damage
inflicted by beam weapons and introducing latency into firing solutions
and control of missiles and torpedoes.

To hit a target with a missile, Roll for Accuracy using Gunner (Turret)
or Gunner (Capital Weapons), as appropriate, modified by the Weapon
ranges table, below.

Next, consult the Missile To Hit table below to find the target number
that the Gunner must make, on 2D, using either Gunner (Turret) or
Gunner (Capital Weapons), for the missile to strike its target.

Some weapons have fixed limits on the range as indicated in the
expanded spacecraft construction chapter. Spinal mounts have an
additional –1 DM if shooting at close or adjacent range.

#### CAPITAL SHIPS & INITIATIVE

The basic Traveller space combat rules call for a ship’s captain to roll
2d6 for Initiative, with the faster vessel gaining a +1 DM. Actions and
damage take place in order of Initiative.

For capital ships, Initiative works differently.

## EEXPANDEDXPANDED S SPACEPACE C COMBATOMBAT

Rolling for Initiative: Rolling for Initiative: Capital ships roll only 1d6 for Initiative, but add
their Crew Skill to their total Initiative. The fleet commander may also
make a Tactics (Naval) Check and add the effect to the fleet. Optionally,
a chained roll (see Traveller core rulebook page 51) can be made by the
fleet commander, and each ship captain may make their own Tactics
(Naval) check.

Resolving Attacks: Resolving Attacks: Instead of resolving all attacks from a ship at once,
capital ships trade barrages or other combat actions such as boarding
or moving. All ships in a battle make one attack in descending order of
Initiative, then the order of actions loops back around to the vessel with
the highest Initiative again. Keep looping until all ships have taken all
the combat actions they wish to take.

#### BARRAGES

The basic Traveller space combat rules track each individual laser beam
and missile. The average Free Trader vessel has only two or three
turrets and a handful of weapons, so it is reasonable to deal with each
attack roll singly. However, the average capital ship mounts hundreds of
turrets and dozens of bays. While it is still possible to deal with all the
attacks from a capital ship broadside individually, few referees have the
patience to bother with several thousand dice rolls.

To deal with large numbers of simultaneous attacks, High Guard
introduces the concept of the barrage attack. At its simplest, the barrage
attack involves taking all attacks of the same type on the same target
as a single attack. The size of the barrage is measured by the number
of dice involved. For example, a beam laser deals 1d6 damage, so a
barrage from fifty beam lasers would be a fifty dice barrage.

The damage from each individual weapon must still be noted, though,
as armor is obviously much more effective against smaller weapons
than larger ones. The notation for a barrage is therefore:

(Number of Dice) – (Weapon Type) – Range – (Individual Weapon (Number of Dice) – (Weapon Type) – Range – (Individual Weapon
Damage in dice).Damage in dice).

- Missile accuracy is not dependent on range save at very high distances. Missiles cannot be used against targets at Adjacent and Close ranges.

###### SSPACEPACE C COMBATOMBAT SPACE COMBAT

For example, the fifty beam laser barrage mentioned above would be
noted as 50–Beam Laser– Medium–150–Beam Laser– Medium–1 and a barrage from ten missile
50 ton bays of multiple warhead missiles at long range would be
noted as 10–Missile–Long–1210–Missile–Long–12.

At minimum, a barrage must include ten weapons of the same time
or all the weapons on the ship of that type if fewer are mounted.

Configuration: Configuration: A capital ship cannot always bring all its weapons to
bear at all times. Each configuration of capital ship lists a percentage
value; this is the percentage of turrets or bays that can be aimed at
a single target. The size of a barrage aimed at that target is therefore
capped by this percentage.

Barrage Attacks
A barrage does not ‘hit’ or ‘miss’ as a whole. Even an inaccurate
barrage will usually score one or two minor hits. Instead, the more
accurate the barrage is, the more damage it deals. An attack with
a barrage roll is made by rolling two dice and with dice modifiers
for range, fire control software, dodging, Gunner skill and ship
defences. The modifiers for range, fire control software, dodging
and skill are as normal spacecraft combat. The modifiers from the
ship defences are worked out below. Note that the missile launch
accuracy check and the help line up a shot check are not used in
capital ship combat.

_For example, the Bucephalus launches a flight of two hundred nuclear
missiles at long range at the Victory. Each nuclear missile deals 2d6
damage, so it’s a 200–Nuclear Missile–Long–2 Barrage. The crew of
the Bucephalus have a skill rating of 3 and operating fire control/4. The
Victory reacts to the fire by dodging, with the crew passing the check.
The total modifiers for this barrage (so far) are range (+0), dodging (–
2), skill (+3) and fire control (+4) for a total of +5. The Bucephalus rolls
7 on two dice. The net score, before taking account of defences is 12._

Barrages & Defences
Barrage attacks interact with defences slightly differently to normal
attacks. Instead of reducing the damage directly, defences such
as armor or sand provide a DM to the attack roll. Add up the
protection offered by the defences, and then subtract it from the
individual weapon damage score to determine the final DM.

Armor: Armor: Armor contributes directly to defence against all types
of attack. Add the armor rating to the defence total. (Note that
this means that armor works better against barrages than against
individual attacks).

Sand: Sand: Sand protects against incoming laser attacks and missile
attacks fired from medium range or longer. Roll 1d6 for the amount of
protection offered by a sand cloud, modified as below. If the modified
dice roll is zero or less, the sand protection modifier is zero.

RatioRatio ProtectionProtection

Screens: Screens: Screens apply only against attacks of the appropriate type
(nuclear dampers vs nuclear missiles or fusion beams, meson screens
against meson guns). Note that nuclear dampers are not effective
against bomb–pumped torpedoes as these detonate beyond the effect
of the damper. Screens offer two points of protection per screen.

Configuration:Configuration: Certain ship configuration offer protection against
meson weapons as they are particularly compact, increasing the
likelihood of decay occurring outside the ship.

Point Defence Lasers: Point Defence Lasers: Point defence lasers protect only against
incoming missile attacks. Roll 1d6 for the amount of protection

For example, the Bucephalus missile flight has a net dice score of 12
before defences are taken into account. The Victory has 2 points of
armor, fifty lasers and sixty sandcasters for point defence and two
nuclear dampers and her crew is skill level 3.

The protection from the armor is 2 and 4 from the nuclear dampers.
The protection from the lasers is d6 modified by the crew skill (+1) and
number of lasers (90% or less, –1). The dice roll is 2, so the total laser
defence is 2. The protection from the sandcasters is d6 modified by the
crew skill (+1) and number of sandcasters (90% or less, –2). The dice roll
is 1, giving a score of 0, so the total sandcaster defence is 0.

###### SPACE COMBAT SSPACEPACE C COMBATOMBAT

The total defensive DM is then 2 (armor) +4 (screens) +1 (lasers) +0
(sandcasters) = 7. Hence the net barrage score is 12–7=5.

Splitting Barrages
Not all of a ship’s weapons of a particular type need be aimed at a
single target. A ship with 100 laser turrets and thirty fusion bays,
for instance, can fire fifty laser turrets and thirty fusion guns at
one target, 25 lasers at another target, and 25 at a third. It may not,
however, fire multiple barrages of the same at a single target – it
could not fire fifty lasers at a target in one barrage and then fire
another fifty in a second barrage. All barrages of the same type on
the same target must be combined into one.

Barrage Damage
The damage from the barrage is determined from the following
table, using the net dice score. Barrage damage is rounded down.

On small craft or spacecraft, multiply the final barrage total by 3 to
determine the actual amount of damage inflicted by the attack. If the
barrage total is greater than the ship’s remaining Hull + Structure,
assume that the ship is annihilated by the attack instead of working
out each individual hit.

On capital ships, barrage damage works slightly differently. See
Capital Ship Damage, below.

For example, the Bucephalus has launched a flight of two hundred
nuclear missiles at the Victory with a net score of 5.

A net dice roll of 5 gives 50%, so Victory is hit by 100 nuclear missiles for
a total of 200 points of damage.

Spinal Weapon Attacks
To hit with a spinal mount is a Formidable task (–6 DM), with the
following modifiers: fire control software (up to +5 DM), crew skill
(typically +3 to +5 DM), range modifier, dodge modifier, if a Pilot skill
check is successful (–2 DM) and a size modifier. All spinal mounts
have an optimum range of Long. The size modifier is as follows:

- Ships under 10,000 tons DM –1
- Ships under 1,000 tons DM –2
- Ships under 100 tons DM –3

Example ISS Implacable fires at CNS Zdatl. DMs are task (–6), fire
control/5 (+5), experienced crew (+3), Zdatl is dodging (–2) and Zdatl
is 500,000 tons (DM–0). Net DM is –6+5+3–2=0. Implacable will hit
on a raw dice score of 8+.

Before they can damage their target, Meson Guns must penetrate
the target’s meson screen and ensure that it decays within the
ship. Compare the penetration rating of the meson gun with the
configuration of the ship and the number of screen points being
generated (2 or screen or 3 if the screens to full action is being used)
and roll the number indicated or more on 2d6 to penetrate the ship’s
defences.

Spinal Weapon Damage
Particle Beam spinal mount damage is reduced by the amount of
armor. Reduce Damage by 30 per point of armor. Damage can
not be reduced below zero. However, there is still residual damage
arising from the spinal weapon hit. Take 10% of the damage value
of the particle beam hit absorbed by the armor and treat this as
a standard barrage hit (although on a single section), even if the
spinal weapon otherwise did no damage. This residual damage
cannot inflict system hits. Note that a meson spinal mount does not
inflict residual damage.

For example a 200 damage particle beam spinal mount hits a ship
with 4 points of armor. (200–(4 x 30)) 80 damage is treated as spinal
weapon damage and (4 x 30 x10%) 12 damage is treated as a barrage
hit on the hit section.

For example the same 200 damage particle beam spinal mount hits a
ship with 8 points of amour. (200 – (8 x 30)) 0 damage is treated as
spinal weapon damage and (10%) 20 damage is treated as a barrage
hit on the hit section.

Both types of spinal mount inflict radiation damage. Divide the
damage inflicted on the ship by the spinal mount (including residual
damage from particle beam hits) by 6 (rounding down) to find
the radiation damage inflicted. Divide further by 2 if the hull has
radiation shielding.

Using the first example above, the particle beam inflicted a total of
92 points of damage. The radiation hits inflicted are (92/6 rounded
down) 15.

Spinal mount damage is then resolved as below.

#### CAPITAL SHIP DAMAGE

On board a capital ship, there are dozens of mechanics and repair
robots working constantly to reactivate damaged systems, and
there are too many turrets and other components to track damage
individually. The normal damage rules can be used when a starship
or small craft is attacking a capital ship, with one exception – it is
impossible to inflict a third hit on a Drive, Power Plant, Sensor or
Bridge system on a capital ship.

For barrage attacks on a capital ship, follow these rules:

Location
First, determine the location of the attacks by rolling for the section
struck.

Adjacent Locations:Adjacent Locations: A turret, barbette or bay attack splits its damage
50/50 between the section hit and any one adjacent section chosen
by the attacker. Spinal mount damage is inflicted on a single
section. For example, on the CF–code hull, Engineering is adjacent
to the Main section, and the Forward section is adjacent to the Main
section, and the Main section is adjacent to both.

Apply Damage
Subtract the damage inflicted by the attack from the Hull score of the
damaged section. If a section is reduced to zero Hull in a barrage,
remaining damage is subtracted from the Structure score of the

###### SSPACEPACE C COMBATOMBAT SPACE COMBAT

Power Plant:Power Plant:
First Hit: First Hit: Damage to a Power Plant reduces a capital ship’s ability
to employ its energy weapons or engines. Reduce the ship’s Power
Number by 1, which may also reduce its ability to employ weapons
and its Thrust or Jump.
Second Hit: Second Hit: Decrease the ship’s Power Number by 2.
Third Hit: Third Hit: Power plant is disabled, disabling the entire ship.

Fuel: Fuel: 1d6x5% of fuel reserves are lost. Halve this value if metal
hydride storage is used in this section. If different fuel types are
present roll to determine which is hit.

Sensors:Sensors:
First Hit: First Hit: –1d6DM to all Sensors checks made using the sensors in
that section. Roll this DM once; it remains until repaired.
Second Hit: Second Hit: Sensors in that section are disabled.

Computer:Computer:
First Hit: First Hit: All rolls made by the capital ship suffer a –1DM.
Second Hit: Second Hit: All rolls made by the capital ship suffer a –1d6DM,
rerolled each time.
Third Hit: Third Hit: Computer is disabled; the ship cannot jump or fire
weapons at targets beyond Close range.

Bridge:Bridge:
First Hit: First Hit: A bridge hit prevents the ship from manoeuvring or
jumping next round.
Second Hit: Second Hit: The bridge is destroyed. Command automatically
transfers to another section, but the ship’s Initiative is halved.

Crew: Crew: A crew hit reduces the Crew Strength by one step.

Critical Hit
If a section suffers a critical hit, something has gone drastically
wrong. Roll 1d6 on the Critical Hit table:

1. Power Failure: 1. Power Failure: The section goes offline for one round. Weapons
and components in the section cannot be used next round.
2. Structural Failure: 2. Structural Failure: A whole section of the ship shears away.
Reduce the remaining Hull of the section by 50%. If no hull remains,
reduce the remaining Structure by 50%.
3. Hull Breach: 3. Hull Breach: Repairs cannot be conducted on this section for one
round, as the repair crews need to fix the hull breach. Also inflicts a
Crew Hit. A self–sealing hull means that the breach is automatically
fixed, so repairs can take place immediately.
4. Internal Explosion: 4. Internal Explosion: The explosion inflicts 6d6 Structure damage
and another Section Hit.
5. Cascade Failure: 5. Cascade Failure: Roll again twice on the Section Hit table.
6. Fire: 6. Fire: Fire suppression systems fail, and an inferno rages through
the section. The crew must roll Discipline 8+ to put the fire out next
round, or it will inflict another Section Hit. If not put out, the target
number rises by +1 each round (Discipline 9+ in round two, 10+ in
round 3). At 12+, the fire spreads to another section, starting at 8+
there. If metal hydride fuel is stored in this section the Discipline
target number is reduced by 2.

same section. If the hull score of the hit section is already zero, all
damage is subtracted from the subtracted from the Structure score
of the same section. Meson weapons are the exception as damage
is inflicted on Structure instead. If a section is reduced to zero
Structure, it is destroyed and the ship is crippled or destroyed.

Roll for System Damage
A barrage hit may inflict some system damage if the net Barrage
Attack Roll was an 8+. Roll on the Section Hit Table for the section
or sections struck by the attack to determine which system is
damaged. If the damaged section still has Hull remaining, roll on
the External column; otherwise, roll on the Internal column. Meson
weapons only roll on the internal column. Spinal weapons roll a
number of times on the section hit table, with one roll for every 50
points of damage inflicted (excluding residual particle beam weapon
damage).

Turrets:Turrets:
First Hit: First Hit: A turret hit gives a –1d6DM to all turret barrages of that
type. Reroll the DM for each barrage until repaired.
Second Hit:Second Hit: Increase the DM to –1d6+1.
Third Hit: Third Hit: Turrets can no longer fire.

Bay:Bay:
First Hit: First Hit: A Bay hit gives a –1d6DM to all bay barrages of that type.
Reroll the DM for each barrage until repaired.
Second Hit: Second Hit: Increase the DM to –1d6+1.
Third Hit: Third Hit: Bays can no longer fire.

Hull: Hull: A hull hit indicates an explosion on the surface, and inflicts extra
Hull damage equal to half the damage inflicted by the barrage.

Armor: Armor: An armor hit reduces the armor of that section by 1.

Structure:Structure: A structure hit indicates an external explosion or structural
failure, and inflicts extra Structure damage equal to half the damage
inflicted by the barrage.

Spinal Weapon:Spinal Weapon:
First Hit: First Hit: A spinal weapon hit gives a –2 DM to spinal weapon
attacks.
Second Hit: Second Hit: The spinal weapon is disabled and can no longer fire.

Screen: Screen: Damage to a screen reduces its protection by 2 until
repaired.

Jump Drive:Jump Drive:
First Hit: First Hit: The first hit on a Jump drive gives –1d6DM to all Jump
attempts until repaired.
Second Hit: Second Hit: The jump drive is disabled.

Maneuver Drive: Maneuver Drive: Each hit on a Maneuver drive reduces the ship’s
Thrust by 1 until repaired.

###### SPACE COMBAT SSPACEPACE C COMBATOMBAT

Radiation Attacks
Some weapons, such as nuclear missiles or meson weapons, can
cause radiation hits. The more radiation, the more likely it is that
the ship suffers a Crew, Computer or Sensor Hit. Ships with nuclear
dampers or radiation shielding will suffer no radiation damage from
nuclear weapons or fusion guns. Ships with armor ratings of 8 or
more ignore radiation hits from all but meson weapons.

For barrage weapons each nuclear missile, fusion gun, particle
beam and meson weapon will inflict the radiation hits on the basis
of the percentage score on the barrage table multiplied by the crew
hit per weapon (1 except for meson flicker weapons) and be placed
in a damage band. Reduce the damage band by the armor rating of
the ship for all bar meson weapons and by the meson screen rating
for meson weapons. Reducing the damage band to 0 results in no
damage. Then compare the damage to determine the throw needed
to inflict a hit.

For example, a barrage of 40 nuclear missiles rolls a 6 on the barrage
table. The radiation damage inflicted is equal to (40 x 75% x1) 30. This
is damage band 4. The target has armor 2. The revised damage band
is 2.

For example, a barrage of 10 50 ton meson flicker bays rolls 5 on the
barrage table. As a 50 ton meson flicker bay usually inflicts d6+3 radiation
hits, another d6 is rolled for a score of 6. The radiation damage inflicted
is equal to (10 x 50% x(6+3)) 45. This is damage band 6. The target has
a meson screen 3. The revised damage band is 3.

Repairing Damage
A capital ship may attempt to repair one system per section during
the Ship Action phase, as normal. Multiple attempts may be made
to repair a damaged system if it extends through multiple sections.

For example, a spinal weapon extends though the Forward and Main
sections of a destroyer. The spinal weapon is hit by an enemy attack.
The crew make one repair attempt on the spinal weapon in the Forward
section, but fail to repair it. The repair attempt for the Main section is
also spent on the spinal weapon, and this time they are able to repair
the damage.

Crew Hits
Each crew hit reduces the ship’s crew by one step – from Full to
Weakened, Weakened to Half, Half to Skeleton and so on. Reduced
crews affect a ship’s ability to fight.

The Frozen Watch: The Frozen Watch: Many warships carry extra crew in low
berths. These men of the frozen watch can be revived to provide
reinforcements in the midst of battle. Reviving the frozen watch may
be done at any time but takes 6 turns to thaw, brief and get to the
right place. Until the 6 turns have passed, the ship will suffer from
any applicable skills DMs.

###### SSPACEPACE C COMBATOMBAT SPACE COMBAT

#### FIGHTER FLIGHTS

A large number of spacecraft can be combined into a _flight_ , which
allows them to act in concert and act as a single unit, concentrating
their attacks into a barrage. The skill level of the flight is the average
skill of the craft in the flight; the thrust of the flight is equal to the
lowest Thrust of the craft in the flight – with the proviso that the
flight must remain together at all times. (Of course, the flight can
then become a single target for barrages, so life could be short...)

Attacks By Flights
Flights can combine their weapons in barrages as normal.

Attacks On Flights
Attacks can be made on individual craft in the flight as normal.

Barrage attacks on flights suffer a –4 DM, representing the difficulty
of hitting a distributed set of targets. Barrage damage is assumed
to inflict a number of hits equal to the barrage total. Flights lose a
number of craft whose combined Hull and Structure total is equal
to the barrage total; any excess barrage damage is applied as normal
hits. The flight will lose a maximum number a craft based on the
lower of the number of mounts firing or the average gunnery crew
for that weapon system. Ship designers are encouraged to provide
sufficient gunners for turret weapons to maximise their anti–fighter
defences.

For example, a flight of 300 fifty–ton fighters (Hull 1, Structure 1) is hit
by a 200 point barrage. Rolling for barrage effectiveness, the attacker
rolls a 10, –4 for targeting a flight for a result of 6, or 75% effectiveness.
The resulting total is 150 points of barrage damage. Each fighter can
absorb two points of barrage damage, so 75 fighters would be destroyed.
However, for this weapon system the ship has the equivalent of 60
gunners, so despite the damage only 60 fighters are destroyed.

#### ORDERS

This section presents a set of optional rules for space combat, where
the commander of a space vessel can issue one or more orders to
his crew each round. Each order temporarily reduces the ship’s
Initiative by a certain amount, which also reduces the number of
reactions the ship can take. A commander may issue any number of
orders, as long as the orders do not bring the ship’s Initiative below

0. Each order can only be issued once per round unless otherwise
noted.

InitiativeInitiative ReactionsReactions
0–4 1
5–8 2
9–12 3
13+ 4

Orders are written down secretly by each ship commander, and
revealed simultaneously at the start of each round.

###### SPACE COMBAT SSPACEPACE C COMBATOMBAT

The format of orders is:
Order Name
Initiative Cost: This cost applies only for the round in which the order
is executed.
Type: Orders fall into several types depending on when they are
executed. Combat Orders are executed in the Combat Action phase,
while Ship Orders are executed in the Ship Action phase. Special
Orders are executed when noted in the text.
Requirements: Some orders can only be executed by a crew with a
certain level of Crew Skill or other requirement.

Emergency Orders
Some orders are followed by an exclamation mark (!), denoting they
are emergency orders. Emergency orders can be issued as a reaction
to an attack instead of during the order phase. Only one emergency
order can be issued per ship per round.

Repeatable Orders
Some orders are followed by an asterisk (*), denoting they are
repeatable orders. A repeatable order can be given multiple times in
one round, as long as the ship has the Initiative to allocate to it.

Line up Spinal Mount!
Initiative Cost: 2
Type: Combat
Requirements: ship fitted with spinal mount

Choose a friendly ship within Close range. Attacks on that ship may
be intercepted by the active ship’s sandcasters, screens and other
defensive weapons.

Evasive Action*
Initiative Cost: 4
Type: Special
Requirements: None
The ship gains one extra point of thrust this round which can only be
spent on dodging incoming fire, and does not count as a reaction.

Fast Strafing Run
Initiative Cost: 4
Type: Special
Requirements: Only undertaken by small craft
If the small craft flight is within Close range of a hostile target, it
can maneuver in to undertake a low level strafing run under the
elevation of the weapons on the target vessel. Shooting at the flight
is at –2 DM. The fire of the flight receives a +2 DM.

###### SSPACEPACE C COMBATOMBAT SPACE COMBAT

_Fighter Screen
Initiative Cost: 4
Type: Special

functionality for this round. At the end of the round, the system
becomes disabled.

Maximum Speed
Initiative Cost: 4
Type: Combat
Requirements: None
All available power is allocated to the engines. The ship may only
fire half its turrets and bays this round, rounding down, but may
increase its Thrust by 1.

Opportunity Fire!
Initiative Cost: 6

Hits, roll 1d6 for each Crew Hit. On a 4+, ignore the Crew Hit.

Roll The Ship!
Initiative Cost: 4
Type: Combat
Requirements: Crew Skill 1+
The ship rolls, making it harder to target specific sections of its hull.
This gives a –2 DM to attacks using the Target That Section order.

Run Silent, Run Dark
Initiative Cost: 4
Type: Special
Requirements: None
The ship shuts down all non–essential systems and attempts to
minimise electromagnetic emissions. The ship may not move or fire
this round, or use any active sensor systems. All attempts to detect
the ship using sensors suffer a –2 DM.

Screens to Full!
Initiative Cost: 4
Type: Special
Requirements: None
Full power is allocated to the ship’s screens. Screens now provide
three points of protection per screen instead of two.

Target That Section*
Initiative Cost: 4
Type: Special
Requirements: Crew Skill 1+
One of the ship’s attacks this round targets a specific section of the
enemy vessel.

#### ALTERNATIVE MOVEMENT

An optional way of fighting space battles (be they with small craft,
space craft or capital ships) is with miniatures or counters. Whilst
slightly more complicated that the standard rules they give players
and referees the opportunity to give their ship handling and naval
tactics skills a real workout!

Asteroid fields are not actually dense enough to represent a hazard
to piloted vessels. Individual asteroids can be up to 0.5 units across
but the majority are much smaller than this. Asteroid fields should
be represented as irregular shaped zones on the playing area. A
vessel hiding behind one or more than 3 units within one have their
lines of sight blocked.
Any vehicle, be it missile or torpedo barrage, small craft, flight
of small craft, space craft or capital ship can apply thrust in any
direction by its thrust value, with each thrust point changing the
vector by 1 unit. The process for movement is as follows.

###### SSPACEPACE C COMBATOMBAT SPACE COMBAT

Marker at original position Ship moved to future position marker

Current Position Marker at future position

Marker at original position Apply change to vector

Step 1 Record future position based on current vector. A marker represents the position of the ship at the end of the turn if it maintains
its current vector without any thrust changes.

Step 2 Move ship based on current vector. The ship is moved to the position occupied by the marker. The starting position is identified
with a marker.

Step 3 Apply change in vector. Thrust is then applied to ship in any direction within the limits of the vessel’s maneuver drive rating.

###### SPACE COMBAT SSPACEPACE C COMBATOMBAT

Place marker at new future
position

Vector as measured at step 3

Marker at original position

Measure vector

Step 4 Measure revised vector. The direction and distance of the ship from the marker showing the starting position of the ship should
be measured.

Step 5 Determine future position. A marker showing the future position is then placed in exactly the same direction and distance
measured at step 4.

Craft launching start with the base vector of their parent ship and need to match their parent ship’s vector to land.

###### SSPACEPACE C COMBATOMBAT

1G

Small Gas Giant

Move end position 1 unit
towards center of gravity

Effect of Gravity
When fighting in the presence of a significant gravity field that field
acts as an additional “thrust” on the craft fighting within it. For
combat purposes only gravity fields of 1G or more significantly above
the planet’s surface are considered significant and hence only fields
around gas giants are considered. If a ship contacts the surface of
a planet at a speed of more than 1 unit per turn it is assumed to be
destroyed (either burnt up or crashed).

The gravity fields of gas giants are as follows:

Gas GiantGas Giant Radius of gravity fieldRadius of gravity field
1 1.51.5 2 2.52.5
Small 24 – – –
Large 90 72 66 60

If at any stage the path of a vessel lies within the gravity field of a
body, it attracts thrust as shown below as an additional change in
vector at Step 3 above.

Non–Movement Activities
Ignore the missile and torpedo ‘turns to impact’ table (see Traveller
core rulebook page 147). Sandcaster fire is assumed to disperse
in the turn it is fired and is not recorded. Missiles do not make a
chained task roll for accuracy, but include the range DM from the
time they are fired when making the final attack roll on the turn of
impact. Every other feature of combat is exactly the same as the
current rules.

###### SPACE COMBAT

Every industrial world produces several different models of shuttle and air/raft, so across the Imperium as a whole there are literally
thousands of small craft variants. The most popular are produced and used by the megacorporations, but experienced spacefarers learn to
cope with the quirks of unusual local craft. When you have flown through an enemy blockade in a craft that’s more bailing wire and untested
telekinesis, you can truly call yourself a traveller.

#### CIVILIAN CRAFT

These small craft are customarily unarmed and unarmored, and can be encountered throughout known space.

Launch
Also termed a life boat, this craft uses a 20–ton hull. It is commonly used across the Imperium and is actually an expensive model,
incorporating radiation and heat shielding and other protective measures to preserve its fragile but vital cargo. Cheaper short–range
launch pods are used for salvage operations and transfers between ships and stations in orbit. This is a standard design for which the 10%

Modular Cutter
The fifty–ton modular cutter is capable of good speed within a

feature is the 30 ton ‘module bay’ that allows the cutter to be quickly
and easily reconfigured for different missions. Changing the module
is an Easy (+4 DM) Intelligence– based Engineer (any) or Mechanic

Surveyor
The planetary surveyor is a long–endurance small craft designed for
exploring planetary systems. It carries a full suite of probe drones
and an advanced sensors suite, requiring the presence of an extra
crew member as a sensor operator. As survey missions often
take place over several weeks, the craft has a pair of staterooms
for the crew, and most surveyors carry six or nine crew members
working in shifts. The air in a surveyor often qualifies as a low–level

#### MILITARY CRAFT

Military small craft fall into two types – armed versions of civilian
craft, such as armored shuttles or boarding craft, and combat craft
like fighters and bombers.

Light Fighter
The light fighter is a small fast, highly manoeuvrable ship used
for making high–speed attack runs on enemy ships. They consist

mainly of a power plant attached to a laser or other weapon with a
pilot sitting on top. Fighters pose aggravating tactical complications
for the commander of a vessel under attack by them, but are seldom
enough to destroy a larger ship without support. This is a standard

Multipurpose Fighter
Multi–purpose fighters are twenty–ton combat craft that are jack of

as fast as higher–performance interceptors, They have a modular
weapon bay that can take a missile launcher and its ammunition, a
laser or a particle beam, allowing them, if given sufficient foresight,
to be an extremely effective combatant. They have aerofins and twin
plasmas weapons which also makes them very effective against
vehicles and ground targets.

Versions of the multipurpose fighter armed with pulse lasers, beam
lasers and particle beams have a two tons cargo and the version
with a sandcaster (and 20 rounds of ammunition) has one ton
cargo. These cost MCr 31.76, MCr32.26, MCr 35.26 and MCr31.51

but it can be much larger or smaller; the tender is a much larger
but lightly armed ship with enough cargo capacity to hold one or
more battle riders. The tender jumps into the disputed system
and deploys its riders. Without the need to allocate a considerable
percentage of its tonnage to jump fuel, the rider is capable of
engaging and destroying much larger vessels, but it is vulnerable if
fighting against overwhelming forces and being unable to retreat.

Sylea class Battleship
The Sylea class represents a modern battleship of the Imperial
Navy, with the largest possible meson spinal mount, the heaviest
protection available and large secondary and tertiary batteries. Whilst
it does not have the strategic deployability of the more specialized
Plankwell class, the Sylea class is fully capable of fulfilling all the key
tactical and strategic roles required, including the provision of flag
facilities.

It lacks the very large troop capacity (A Sylea class ‘only’ carries
a marine battalion) and fighter screen of older battleships and
dreadnoughts such as the Tigress class, but recent Imperial doctrine
is for more specialist vessels with troops carried on troop transports,
fighters on carriers with smaller more cost–effective battleships for
duties in the line of battle.

The term ‘capital ship’ is something of a misnomer – it should be
used only to describe those vessels that are so large and powerful
that they are the center of a whole squadron, such as battleships
and dreadnoughts. However, small–ship pilots tend to apply the
phrase to any gargantuan super–ship massing tens of thousands
of tons. Most capital ships are in the hands of governments or
megacorporations – for a private individual to own such a ship
is almost unthinkable, although there are a few wealthy nobles
or supremely successful mercenary commanders with personal
warships.

#### BATTLESHIP

The power of the Imperial Navy is concentrated in its battleships.
The definition of a battleship is a ship which, due to its armament
and protection, is capable of standing in the line of battle. When
a battleship meets any lesser type of ship, its victory is almost
guaranteed. When battleships on two sides meet, victory goes to
the better armed, better armored and better directed ship.

Considered part of the battle line, battle riders and battle tenders
are the latest development in warship technology. The battle rider is
a combat craft without a jump engine, typically about 30,000–tons

#### PLANETOID MONITOR

Planetary defence forces do not always require jump capable vessels and employ non–jump capable vessels known as monitors. These can
be little different from the Imperial Navy’s battleriders, but many navies protecting systems with asteroid belts can build highly effective
combat units, at a much cheaper cost, using planetoids for their hulls. Each such monitor is almost inevitably unique, but this one is
representative.

#### CRUISER

Cruisers are more lightly armored and less heavily armed than battleships. To unarmed, unarmored ships, this difference is negligible
since a cruiser can easily attack and destroy any non–combat ships. Cruisers are assigned to support battleships and carry combat to areas
where a battleship is not considered necessary.

Planet class Heavy Cruiser
The Planet class heavy cruiser is typical for such ships in the Imperial Navy: a long cone structure studded with weaponry using the most
advanced (TL15) technology available. Well armed and well armored, it fulfils the basic design requirement of meeting the enemy and
winning in battle. The Planet class is the latest design of heavy cruiser in Imperial service and will gradually replace the existing main heavy
cruiser, the Atlantic class, which is fast approaching obsolescence due to shortfalls in its defences and operational limitations from its 5G
acceleration.

This class of cruiser will also prove useful for independent operations, especially beyond the Imperial borders with 2 companies of Imperial
Marines available for “goodwill” operations. Used alone, the ships are capable of a range of diplomatic and scientific operations. Used in
squadrons, they provide a useful show of force or reinforcement for friendly client states.

#### CARRIER

Carriers are designed to carry large numbers of small combat craft, which in turn attack the enemy’s combatants or installations.

Light Carrier
A thirty–thousand–ton Light carrier is the centrepiece of many planetary navies. The carrier is capable of acting as an orbital fighter base, and
by using atmosphere–capable fighters, the navy can exert control over both sky and local space. Light carriers are relatively lightly armed,
as they are not expected to engage another capital ship. This design is TL 13, but more advanced light carriers are also used by the Imperial
Navy. Note that 20–ton fighters may be exchanged for 40–ton fighters on a 2:1 basis, resulting in a wing of up to 80 40–ton fighters.

#### ESCORT

Escort vessels are intended to protect and assist larger vessels.
They are capable of independent action, but are usually assigned to
support battleships and cruisers.

P.F. Sloan class Fleet Escort
Fleet escorts are designed for routine fleet security and support
and to mop up damaged enemy vessels, or to deal with smaller
hostile ships. They are not made to take on other capital ships. Fleet
escorts are assigned in quantity for local or system defence any time
that several squadrons or a fleet are present. If it is remembered
that _Sloans_ are lightly armed and armored, then their performance
can be seen as admirable, although they cannot withstand major
engagements. It should be noted that apart from the TL15 sensor
suite, the ship can be built at TL12–13, increasing the number of
yards capable of building and supporting this vessel.

#### OTHER VESSELS

Superfreighter
This vessel is more than 2,000 tons, but is not a capital ship. The megacorporations use massive cargo ships like this one to conduct
interstellar trade. Capturing a superfreighter is the ultimate goal of many pirate gangs. All but 3,563 tons of its cargo is carried in 2,000 ton
modules which can be used as cargo containers, fuel tanks, space habitats and so on. The ship’s integral fuel tanks only have enough fuel
for Jump–3, although it can use containerised fuel (10,000 tons) to make Jump–4.

The traditional Traveller campaign starts after the characters have
left their previous careers and are now wandering adventurers and
free traders. In such a campaign, a character’s time in the navy is
just prologue, a backstory that might contribute a few skills and plot
hooks. It is also possible – with a few necessary changes – to run
a Traveller campaign where the characters are still on active service
in the navy.

Rank and the chain of command become much more important in
a naval campaign. Discuss with the players before the game starts
about how to handle characters of different ranks, as disobeying
orders and arguments over commands can turn a game into a series
of court–martials and shouting matches. Often, it is easier to have
all the characters at roughly the same rank, and have a non–player
character in overall charge. Roleplaying games tend to work best
when the characters have a great deal of freedom to accomplish their
goals, which clashes with the limitations of the chain of command.
Often, the best approach is to put the characters on detached duty,
or in situations where they cannot rely on being told what to do by
their commanding officers.

Remember that the lack of faster–than–light communication in
the default Traveller setting means that a captain is very much on
his own. It will take weeks or months for orders to arrive from his
superiors, so he must use his own judgement when executing his
missions.

Naval Campaign Structures
High Guard: High Guard: The simplest structure is to just generate the characters
normally, but instead of mustering out at the end of character
creation, it is assumed that their final career is also their current
position (obviously, all characters should end in a naval career,
and should have roughly the same number of terms and rank).
The characters should all be assigned to the same ship or base.
For example, they could be the officers of a small escort vessel,
or a team of special forces on a battleship, or a trusted team who
regularly get sent on shore missions.

Rising Through The Ranks:Rising Through The Ranks: In this option, start with the characters
at the naval academy or on their first tour of duty. The campaign is
played episodically, jumping ahead months or years between game
sessions. Each game session revolves around a significant episode
in the characters’ careers, chronicling their rise from lowly recruits
to captains and heroes. This episodic campaign lets you cover a
long period of time; interstellar wars can rage across the galaxy and
empires rise and fall, and the characters happen to be present for
every major event and turning point in history.

These Are The Voyages...: These Are The Voyages...: Another option is to make a single ship
the focus of the whole campaign. You could even have each player
play three different characters – one lowly crewman each, one mid–
ranking officer, and one of the command staff. This ‘troupe–style

play’ puts the decisions in the hands of the characters, but also
ensures that they can get up close and personal with the action. As
the ship is the center of the game, characters can leave, be replaced
or even killed without the campaign coming to a halt.

In Time Of War: In Time Of War: While there is plenty for a naval ship to do during
peacetime (see Naval Missions, below), it is in the crucible of war
that heroes are forged. One classic trope is to put the characters’
ship in a difficult and isolated situation, such as being lost behind
enemy lines or suffer a hit to the bridge, killing the command crew
and forcing the comparatively inexperienced player characters to
take charge.

Shipboard Intrigue: Shipboard Intrigue: Characters who have served four or five terms in
the navy will likely have reached a high rank, and might be involved
in shipboard intrigue against other officers, jockeying for another
promotion or even their own command. Play up the archaic aspects
of the Imperial Navy, and fill the game with swashbuckling duels
and noble titles mixed with far–future technology. In this game, the
dangers faced on the ship’s missions are very much secondary to
outmanoeuvring and outwitting rival ships and officers.

Squadron: Squadron: For a really high–powered naval game, put the characters
in command of one warship each as part of a squadron. This lets
you run party–style adventurers in space (‘ emerging from jumpspace,
you see a flotilla of bandits. Roll for initiative’ ) and gives each player
the maximum amount of individual agency. Squadron–level games
work best in time of war, when the characters will be up against
worthy opponents regularly.

#### NAVAL MISSIONS

For a randomly generated mission for a naval vessel, pick a mission
type and roll on the tables below. Each table gives the initial outline
of the mission, and suggestions for the next table to roll on.

Locations are random locations and worlds where the mission takes
place.

Complications are problems or issues that make it more difficult to
complete the mission.

Opposition is the hostile force that opposes the characters. If the
Opposition is too tough for the characters, and the navy has good
intelligence about the mission, then the characters may be escorted
by extra friendly forces. (Of course, if naval intelligence has no
information about the enemy, then the characters may jump into
the maw of hell.)

Finally, twists are developments that completely recast the initial
mission briefing in a new light.

1 Not what it seems – some element of the mission is different to what the navy believes. A civilian ship might be
a secret enemy vessel, or refugees might be religious fanatics.
2 Ulterior motive – the officer who issued the mission has his own motive for doing so.
3 Cover mission – this mission is actually a cover for another mission being undertaken by another vessel. The
Player Characters are to be as blatant about their activities as possible.
4 Betrayal – someone involved in the mission is an enemy agent.
5 Secret Mission – this mission must be undertaken covertly, and no support will be available.
6 Suicide Mission – this mission is secretly a distraction for the enemy, meant to draw out their forces.
