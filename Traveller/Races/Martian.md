### Martian

The people widely known as Martians, or sometimes Marzians, call themselves by a number of words all of which translate as 'us', 'we' 'the intelligent people of the forests' or other typical self-names. Since most of these are difficult for outsiders to pronounce, the nickname is widely used instead. It seems that the Martians do not really have a concept of themselves as a species, instead referring to their home group as 'us' and everyone else of any species as 'others'.

Physically, the Martians are lightly built humanoids with long arms, reflecting their evolution in the warm, spindly forests where most still make their homes. Traditional villages consist of a handful of extended families, creating a polity whose various names translate as 'us' or 'my village' with no attempt to identify which one it is to an outsider. Martians are quite happy to travel beyond their 'us' but everywhere that is not the home village is foreign – they make no distinction between being in a village a few kilometers from home or on a distant moon a thousand light-years away. Anywhere that is not home, is not home; there really is nothing more to it for a Martian.

#### Creating Martian Travellers
Martians are humanoid and can carry out any task a human can with roughly equal efficiency once they have been shown how. Their language is very difficult to pronounce and hard to follow for non-Martians, so they tend to use Anglic or other local languages, which they have no apparent difficulty in learning.

Characteristics Martian Travellers have the following modifiers applied to their characteristics: STR-1, END-
1, DEX+1. EDU is rolled on 1D and cannot be increased beyond 7.

Traits Martian Travellers all possess the following traits:
Adaptability: All Martians have an instinctive ability to figure out what a tool or item can be used for –
which may not be its intended purpose – or to find, make or wrangle something with which to complete a given task. An INT check (difficulty depends on the nature of the task and the resources at hand)
allows the Martian to come up with an off-the-wall solution to a problem using whatever is to hand.

Telepathic Confusion: Attempts to use telepathy on a Martian invariably fail, leaving the telepath baffled and uneasy.

Careers Most careers from the Traveller Core Rulebook are suitable for Martians, although they gravitate towards 'frontiersman' careers or hands-on jobs like infantry soldiers. A Martian Scholar would be a curious individual, with an alarming and very strange approach to science.

Traditional society uses a curious mix of what are essentially stone-age techniques and materials, mid-tech tools and occasional imported equipment. A Martian will happily use a power tool to knap a stone axe head so he can work on a building project. Thus a traditional village is TL0-1 but the people will make adept use of literally any device or tool they can lay their hands on. Those Martians who live in the cities make use of whatever technology is available but would probably revert to their traditional way of life if others did not provide the technology.

Martians are supremely adaptable to new tools and technologies but have not become dependent upon them. As a result, they are sometimes recruited for colony proving expeditions, coping well with setbacks that might drive more conventional thinkers to despair.  Some even join high-technology services such as merchant lines or the Imperial Navy. Their overall philosophy is curious, in that they have no real interest in 'why'. So long as a Martian knows that action A produces result B, he does not care how or why this happens.

It is possible that everything a Martian ever learns is stored as a separate experience, with few underlying connections and no framework of understanding. Thus a Martian knows that he will fall if he lets go of the ladder but trying to explain gravity or the idea that there is a science called physics to him will result in a shrug and polite incomprehension. There are those who have postulated this indicates a very different form of sentience, which may be worth intense study, although no major research project has been launched.
