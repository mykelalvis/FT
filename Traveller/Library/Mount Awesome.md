# Mount Awesome

Mount Awesome is one the tallest mountains (other than seamounts) found on any world with a breathable atmosphere. It stands over 13,000 metres high, making it about 80% taller than Mount Everest on Terra. What makes Mount Awesome even more spectacular is that it is an isolated peak rising from fairly modest foothills. Mount Awesome is not part of a chain as such, but there are several other mountains within 50 km. None of these stands more than 10,000 metres high. They would be spectacularly large on most worlds but are dwarfed by the majesty of Mount Awesome – hence its name.

The mountains form a rough ring, creating an area which is more or less entirely enclosed by their foothills. This area has a distinct weather pattern and a localised climate with glaciers and meltwater lakes interspersed with rugged open areas and taiga forests. It is a forbidding region which is quite difficult to get into by any means – even flying in with a spacecraft can be a problem since good landing sites are rare and hard to identify from above. Entry at ground level means slogging through the badlands following icy rivers after climbing over the foothills.

This region presents serious challenges for settlement and the creation of a technological society, but is habitable by frontiersmen or primitive people living on a subsistence basis. It is known that small numbers of people have settled within ‘the ring’ as it is known, and a few of their communities are close enough to the outside to receive the odd visitor. Little is known about conditions deeper in, at least by outsiders.

Mount Awesome itself, and presumably at least some of the other great mountains of the region, was formed by a combination of extreme mountain-building and long- ago volcanic events. One of these caused a wide section of the mountain’s side to fall in, creating an enormous crater lake about halfway up. This is surrounded by a high lip whose average altitude is around 9,000 metres - well above the height humans can operate for any length of time without oxygen supplies. The inside of the crater is much lower, and could be explored by humans without artificial equipment so long as they could get into the crater somehow.

This has been done, on more than one occasion. Not all the expeditions went well, but there are records of ships landing in the crater lake rather than trying to spot a good site around its shores. From there, the isolated environment of the crater has been at least cursorily explored and some of its features documented. Since the crater is effectively cut off from the rest of the planet by a barrier that cannot be crossed without an air supply, it has developed its own ecosystem based around a few species that got in somehow.

The crater lake is quite deep in places, and is home to several species of aquatic creatures, whilst on land the dominant life takes the form of fungi, with a few insect- like species that feed upon it. These are found nowhere else, and are of interest to scientists – though the difficulty of studying them is considerable.

There are old fissures and lava tubes under the crater, some going very deep into the mountain. It is possible to ascend over 1,000 metres – possibly more – above the crater lip by means of the lava tubes, and it may

be that some of the lower ones have exit points much further down the mountainside. There are streams running through some of these lower fissures and one major watercourse which bursts from the mountainside at a point where it is nearly vertical. This causes one of the longest waterfalls in the known universe, though wind conditions can cause the fall to disperse into near- constant rainfall in the region below.

According to one of the more successful expeditions, it is possible to transit into the heart of Mount Awesome through the lava tubes, into an ancient magma chamber of immense size. Tubes and fissures run outward and downward from there, but have not been explored. It has been suggested that Mount Awesome or one of the other mountains nearby may be dormant rather than extinct, and that the area described by the ring of foothills might be some kind of supervolcano. There is no strong evidence of recent volcanic activity, however.

The peak of Mount Awesome stands thousands of metres above the crater lake. Anyone attempting to scale it would require high-tech protective equipment at the very least; it is not known if anyone has ever tried, let alone succeeded. It is possible that parties might have landed close to the peak from spacecraft and ascended from there, but even this would be a hazardous undertaking serving no practical purpose beyond the challenge posed by this awesome mountain.
