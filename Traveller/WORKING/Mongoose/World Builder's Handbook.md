# I NTRODUCTION

In all its many iterations since its introduction in 1977,
Traveller has had the distinguishing characteristic
of being both very simple and very extensible. The
simple string of digits, D867974-8, specifies the
Universal World Profile (UWP) of the mainworld of
a system and can represent the entire system, or
be expanded upon in additional publications and
versions, the details of a single world can occupy an
entire book. This book provides the tools to develop
a world’s physical and social characteristics in great
detail but does not require the Referee to expand
details for any particular world. Those star systems
that are nothing but a stopover to refuel and perhaps
pick up some passengers and cargo need no further
work than a string of digits. Those worlds that become
the focus of an adventure can benefit from some or all
of the material in this book.

This book is a descendent of advanced star system
generating procedures first introduced in Classic
Traveller Book 6 Scouts, published in 1983. Further
details of system and world development were
introduced in the Grand Survey and Grand Census
supplements of Digest Group Publications (DGP)
and were then revised and compiled into the World
Builder’s Handbook published for MegaTraveller by
DGP in 1989. Other versions of Traveller have included
detailed star system and world generation materials but
those two publications are the basis in form, although
not necessarily in content, of this book, which bears the
same name as the latter. But at the time these books
were written, no planets outside the solar system had
been discovered.

As this updated World Builder’s Handbook is being
written, more than 5,000 exoplanets are known to
exist. Earlier versions of Traveller assumed, as did
most astronomers of the time, that other solar systems
would look much like ours. This turned out not to be the
case. At least as of the early 2020s, our solar system
appears to be an outlier, not a standard. Forty years
further into the future, much of what follows, at least
on the physical proprieties of star systems and worlds,
will likely be proven incorrect, or at least incomplete,
but this book will attempt to bring the process of star
system generation and physical world development in
line with current knowledge. It will include formulas and
approximations based on physics that are unlikely to

change, regardless of what properties worlds around
distant suns will actually become known to have. The
social characteristics of a world are likely to better
stand the test of time but they suffer, like the original
books’ physical world characteristics assumptions, from
the limitation of being based on a limited exemplar of
past and present human society.

This book allows a Referee to expand on the basic
world characteristics generated and detailed in the
World and Universe Creation chapter of the Traveller
Core Rulebook. Rules for detailing the rest of the
star system – beyond determining the presence of
a gas giant – are not provided in that book but they
were explored in Book 4: Deep Space Exploration
Handbook of the Great Rift box set. This World
Builder’s Handbook takes a different tack than the
DSE, focusing on a methodology more structured and
compatible with formulas and automation (although
any automation of the math and programming
are outside the scope of this book). Both physical
and social aspects of a world’s development are
compatible with the procedures in the Sector
Construction Guide but the focus of this book is on
detailing a single system and its worlds at a point
in time, not on a larger interstellar region and its
historical development.

This book includes star system generation procedures
for determining the type and location of a system’s
significant stars and worlds, an expansion of mainworld
generation – both physical and social – and the
specifics for applying these rules to determine the
physical and (if inhabited) social characteristics of the
star system’s other worlds.

It is not necessary or advisable to detail every world in
every system or even every world in any one system.
These worldbuilding procedures exist to support the
game, not the other way around. Traveller is built
upon a principle of Map Only As Really Necessary (MOARN). The Referee can determine the level of
detail necessary for the enjoyment of all involved.
Referees who want to develop detail beyond what is
necessary are free to do so but it is usually not needed
for the completion of an adventure or campaign. When
information is a prerequisite for developing a specific
point of detail, it will be noted in the text.

While the book provides formulas and tables
compatible with known states of sciences, physical,
social, economic and technological, they do not
represent a comprehensive review of any discipline.
They are designed to be workable rules for developing
details in the Traveller universe. Some of these tables
and formulas have been changed from those provided
in earlier books and supplements as better information
has become available. However just as 5,000 new
worlds have been discovered since Book 6: Scouts
publication and 40+ years of ‘future’ has occurred
since 1983, even our understanding of the past has
changed and will continue to change. While these
guidelines should be ‘good enough’ to simulate many
aspects of a world’s details, they are not conclusive or
limiting and may even be proven incorrect. Referees
are free to adapt or ignore any rolled results if doing so
fits the world they are creating. They are encouraged
to do so. Changing results is not cheating, it is using
the procedures in this book as guidelines to building a
world that meets the needs of the Referee in creating
an enjoyable background for all involved.

The procedures, tables, formulas and forms are meant
to be game aids: a tool set, not a straitjacket. The
chapters provide a great deal of detail and background
but procedures and asides of varying complexity allow
the Referee to tailor the amount of rigour to any one
aspect of creation.

To provide background and context, each chapter will
also detail Imperial Interstellar Scout Service (IISS)
exploration, survey procedures and techniques and
how they apply to the material presented in the chapter.
Whilst none of the procedures in the book require the
setting to be Charted Space during the Golden Age of
the Third Imperium, that is the lens through which the
procedurals are viewed. Three examples at the end of
each chapter will illustrate the procedures:

1. A newly generated example, the Zed system –
    this intentionally overly complex system serves
    as an in-line example of the procedures outlined
    in the handbook.
2. Corella (0314/The Beyond) – a published
    system from the Spinward Extents with data on
    Travellermap.com for the entire system to show
    how to present existing data and expand upon it.
3. Terra and the Solar System of the 2020s – a
    familiar world and solar system that relates the
    information intoa (literally) real world example.

As details develop for a system and mainworld, the
book provides profile shorthand to record information
and a set of standardised forms to display this

information – although they do not need to be
completely filled out for any world or star system.
The Special Circumstances chapter covers ‘empty’
hexes and unusual systems, including those in very
early development and those whose stars have
passed into a long afterlife as white dwarfs, neutron
stars or black holes. Also included are a few new
tools (equipment, vehicles, robots and spacecraft)
used by the IISS to accomplish their exploration and
survey tasks. To summarise the information provided,
the book has appendixes including a glossary to
provide a handy reference to the terms used in this
handbook and a set of checklists to summarise the
creation procedures. These checklists summarise the
material in this book based on creation method and
characteristics to be detailed.

CREATION METHODS


The chapters in the World Builder’s Handbook provide
procedures for a Referee to record and generate a
system in multiple ways, either as an unknown system (as illustrated in Example #1) – this is known as the
expanded method – or as a system with some known
properties (as illustrated in Example #2) – this is known
as the continuation method – or as a way to codify
existing information into Traveller-specific characteristics (as illustrated in Example #3) – this is not so much a
procedure as it is a categorisation method.

EXPANDED METHOD


The expanded method begins with a hex with no
information except that a system exists. This method
is most appropriate for newly created or previously
uncharted systems. While methodical and focused
on creating a naturally occurring star system, it also
demands the most work. Unlike the continuation

USING WORLD BUILDER’S HANDBOOK
This book goes into great detail about the
processes of world generation, including how
to fully create atmospheres, the creation of
weather systems and calculating all socio-economic factors required for a functioning
world. The Referee is free to use as much or
as little information as they like and it may be
beneficial to only use what is truly necessary to
begin with, in order to familiarise yourself with
the systems herein.

introduction



method, every world and significant moon has a chance
of becoming the mainworld and should at least undergo
a cursory determination of their physical characteristics

- or at least Size.

After determining the worlds in the system, the Referee
should choose one world to be the mainworld and
generate whatever detail is necessary. If the system
is uninhabited, then choosing a mainworld is less
important but each system should have a world
designated to give the system its UWP.

CONTINUATION METHOD


The continuation method assumes a mainworld
exists. In every version of Traveller, a mainworld UWP
exists. In some alternate role playing game systems
that have supported Traveller over the decades the
equivalent information may be in a different format but
it can be converted into the information contained in
the UWP: Starport, Size, Atmosphere, Hydrographics,
Population, Government, Law Level and Tech Level.
Other information such as the presence of a gas giant,
various bases and a Travel Zone categorisation are
usually present. In some versions, and for many of
the systems presented on existing maps, additional
information including a more precise population digit
and the quantity of planetoid belts and gas giants may
also exist, as well as information about star classes
and types, system importance, economy, culture,
nobility and the total number worlds. Special remarks
may also define temperature, whether the world
is tidally locked to its sun or whether it is a moon,
amongst other information.

The continuation method can accept this existing
information and structure more detail around it. The
amount of detail is still entirely up to the Referee and
does not all have to be created at once, or at all. With
the mainworld already defined, information about other
worlds in the system or even the nature of the system’s
stars can wait until, or if, it is needed. If the Referee is
only interested in a deeper look at a world’s culture or
economy, those sections can be examined with only
minimal reference to the rest of the book.

CATEGORISATION METHOD


If all or most of the information about a system already
exists from other sources or previous Referee notes,
the categorisation method is really an extreme example
of the continuation method. The profile formats and
forms provided allow the Referee to record existing
information in a standardised structure. Any missing
information can be left blank or developed using the
continuation method as warranted.

DICE


Traveller is based on standard six-sided dice but some
procedures in this book require a linear result of 0–9 or
1–10. The obvious method to achieve this result is to
use 10-sided dice but if those are unavailable or if the
Referee wants to stick with six-sided dice, the following
2D method (among others) with D2 as 1–3 = 1 and 4–
= 2, provides the same result:

D10 Emulation
D26 Result D26 Result
11 1 21 6
12 2 22 7
13 3 23 8
14 4 24 9
15 5 25 0 or 10
16 Roll again 26 Roll again

Different coloured dice aid this process. To indicate
that either actual 10-sided dice or an emulated method
is possible, this book will use a lower case ‘d10’ to
indicate that either method will work. If a percentage
number or greater precision is necessary, then two or
three real or simulated d10 rolls will use the notation
d100 or d1000. In most cases a d10 is intended to
create results in the range of 0–9, but exceptions will
be noted when intended.

introduction

UNITS


This handbook uses units based on standard planet
and star physical properties and the Kelvin (K) absolute
temperature scale. Planetary properties are based
on Terra, or Earth. Star properties are based on Sol,
Terra’s sun. Other properties based on these two
objects include distance between Sol and Terra, and
the length of a year, day and gravity amongst others.

The Kelvin (K) temperature scale uses units of the
same relative value as degrees Celsius but based
on a 0 value of absolute zero, not the melting point
of water. To determine the temperature in Celsius,
simply subtract 273 from the Kelvin value (273.
if precision is desired). Atmospheric pressure is
normally expressed in bar, a non-standard unit equal
to 100,000 Pascals; while not exactly equal to [[Terra|Terran]]
atmospheric pressure at sea level, it is close enough
for comparison purposes.

Certain formulas may use the value and symbol ⊕
for units of Terra or  for units of Sol, relating to the
above units.

**ROUNDING NUMBERS**
The use of formulae and dice with divisors allows
for arbitrary levels of accuracy. For most purposes,
rounding numbers to two or three significant digits or to
hundreds or thousands is sufficient to create detailed
star systems. Unless stated otherwise, rounding is
to the nearest significant digit. The Referee is free to
retain further precision if desired but should consider
that rounding intermediate values before doing a
further calculation may result in slightly divergent final
answers. In most cases, such differences are not
consequential to a usable result.

EXPANDED HEX CODE


Various versions of Traveller have long used the
Expanded Hex Code (eHex) to allow the single-digit
presentation of numbers larger than 9. This code uses
traditional Arabic numbers from 0–9, then hexadecimal (base 16) digits to represent numbers from 10–15 as
A–F. To represent additional numbers, the eHex code
expands this alphabetic enumeration, excluding I and O
for clarity, to reach the number 33 with Z. The Traveller
Core Rulebook incorporates the hexadecimal range
of 0–F for 0–15 and some procedures and examples
in this book can take advantage of the entire eHex
character set to represent numbers 0–33.

introduction



In most instances, this book will use eHex as the
primary format for numbers 10 and greater used in
UWP or additional characteristics. The exception is
Tech Level, when written as TL#, which will use two
digit numbers, e.g., TL11, for consistency and to match
existing Mongoose Traveller publication usage.

RECOMMENDED MATERIALS



AND OTHER RESOURCES


To use this book, the Referee only requires the
Traveller Core Rulebook. References to page numbers
in that book are based on the 2022 update but the
material is present in the previous version as well.
While not required, the Traveller Companion and the
Sector Construction Guide both provide ancillary details
that can be used in conjunction with this book. The
design rules in this World Builders Handbook diverge
greatly from those presented in the Great Rift box
set’s Deep Space Exploration Handbook (Book 4) or
DSE, but some survey techniques and all equipment
and ships in that book are useful additions to any
exploration-focused campaign.

Another useful optional resource is the Central
Supply Catalogue, which provides an extensive list
of equipment, tools and weapons, as well as rules for
the availability and legality of certain items. Design
rules and item lists from the Vehicle Handbook,
High Guard and the Robot Handbook are good
references but, to reiterate, nothing but the Traveller
Core Rulebook is required, although a calculator,
spreadsheet or equivalent app is practically required
to handle some formulas.

Traveller has existed in one form or another since 1977.
During that time, many enthusiasts have provided
resources outside the officially published material to
support Traveller and Charted Space. Among the best
is Travellermap (Travellermap.com) which provides
an interactive view of most of Charted Space in not
only the timeline of this edition (year 1105 of the
Third Imperium) but in periods before and after that
time. Travellermap also provides tools for entering
data and mapping custom sectors for any Traveller

campaign. It can also act as convenient gateway to two
other valuable on-line tools, the Traveller Wiki (wiki.
travellerrpg.com) and Traveller Worlds (members.
ozemail.com.au/~jonoreita/TravellerWorlds).

The Traveller Wiki is a fan-maintained repository of
information for all versions of Traveller. As with any
wiki, content is always evolving, but some entries will
provide detailed information on worlds and systems
in Charted Space. Traveller Worlds is a tool that not
only creates random maps of worlds based on existing
Charted Space information but allows import of custom
information and the creation of random or deliberate
systems compatible with the Traveller 5 ruleset.

Traveller 5, or T5 is a set of rules maintained by
Traveller’s creator Marc Miller. Its mechanics and
design rules are its own but formats for much of the
data in Travellermap and other resources are based on
the format produced by T5 rules. As much as possible,
procedures in this book will try to maintain some
compatibility with T5 formats with regards to system
and world features and statistics, although the methods
to generate these results may vary greatly.

RULE ZERO


The procedures in this World Builder’s Handbook are
meant as a guide to a enhance Referee’s creativity, not
to enforce arbitrary procedures or results. If any roll of
the dice contradicts the Referee’s vision of a system
or world, the Referee is free to change the outcome,
no matter how unlikely. Whatever is not impossible
is permissible, and even those things technically
impossible under the procedures in this book may still
be possible if the Referee wishes it so. It might require
a little extra handwaving to explain the result but that is
still the Referee’s prerogative.

Also, while certain procedures may have prerequisites
beyond what is minimally necessary to describe a
world, for most part, the Referee does not need to
spend the entire day creating just one world if only one
detailed aspect is useful or interesting for running an
adventure. The World Builder’s Handbook allows for
completeness but it does not require it.

introduction

The Imperial Interstellar Scout Service (IISS) is one
of the major services within the Third Imperium, equal
to the Imperial Navy and Army but with a different,
mostly non-military purpose. Its three main functions
are exploration beyond Imperial borders, ongoing
mapping and surveying of Imperial territory and
maintenance of interstellar communications through
its express boat network and subsidiary routes. Scout
bases and express boat maintenance waystations
are scattered across the Imperium and occasionally
outside its official borders.

The Scout Service is based on a long tradition of
interstellar exploration and surveying, and is known for
its lack of hierarchy and the exotic and dangerous nature
of its operations. As with any broad generalisation, this is
both absolutely true and entirely false, depending on the
branch of service and particular assignment.

HISTORY


Of the three Major Races of Humaniti, the Vilani were
first to the stars. The Vilani ventured into space 10,
years before the foundation of the Third Imperium,
exploring their own solar system and then expanding
gradually using large slower-than-light spacecraft. In
-9235, the Vilani discovered jump drive technology
and accelerated their expansion, discovering, mapping
and settling worlds in thousands of systems. Six
thousand years of expansion followed before the Ziru
Sirka, the Grand Empire of Stars or the First Imperium,
ceased expansion and turned inward but the tasks
of surveying and updating of records of the 15,
systems within the Ziru Sirka continued until the fall of
this First Imperium to the upstart Solomani of the [[Terra|Terran]]
Confederation in -2204.

The next four centuries encompassed the Rule of Man,
a Second Imperium sometimes called the Ramshackle
Empire. [[Terra|Terran]] explorers and cartographers applied
their own standards to convert Vilani records,
eventually settling on an amalgam of formats and units
which persist to the current era. [[Terra|Terran]] explorers added
new systems to existing records but unified formats and
consolidated databases remained more an aspiration
than a reality. More than just political and financial
systems began to fail after the Solomani seized control

# I ISS OVERVIEW

of the stultified imperial edifice. By -1776 the dark
age known as the Long Night had begun. Exploration
essentially ceased, except that conducted by private
expeditions or the efforts of individual worlds.

In the latter centuries of the Long Night, the Sylean
Federation was one of many pocket empires –
scattered small states which retained the ability to
travel between the stars. Exploration began as the work
of freelancers, reports from speculative merchants and
occasional patrol vessels travelling beyond the growing
Sylean frontier. Records were spotty in their accuracy,
completeness and format. The goals of explorers,
diplomats, merchants and the military were often at
odds and certainly had different priorities. By -
de facto standards for data collection had begun to
emerge but a formal bureaucracy and standard modes
of operations did not coalesce until the establishment
in -29 of the Sylean Federation Scout Service (SFSS)
by then President and future Emperor Cleon Zhunastu.
The conflict between exploratory and mercantile
factions of the SFSS continued until the establishment
of the IISS in year 0, which removed the mercantile
purview and focused the IISS strictly on exploration and
supporting activities.

The IISS was a major contributor to the rise of the
Third Imperium, recontacting many isolated worlds
and providing demonstrations of the value of joining
this new expanding empire. Within its first century,
scouts had crossed the treacherous Corridor sector,
recontacted the few inhabited worlds in Deneb and
reached the Spinward Marches. In 62, Emperor
Artemsus established an order of knighthood
exclusive to exemplary members of the Scout Service,
the Order of the Arrow.

As the Imperium expanded, IISS records remained
incomplete and often not updated beyond initial
surveys conducted in past centuries. By 298, the lack
of a solid foundation of data and haphazard updates
led Empress Porfiria to incorporate the previously
separate Imperial Grand Survey organisation into the
IISS and instruct the Scout Service to conduct a Grand
Survey of Imperial space and beyond, performing
detailed analysis of not only physical data but also of
demographic and cultural data to help provide a basis
for increasing the cohesiveness of the Third Imperium.



The effort began in 300 and took more than a century
to conduct, with what is now known as the First Grand
Survey completing in 420.

Two decades earlier in 399, on the world then named
Aadkhien (Core/0140), scouts had discovered an
intact complete copy of the Vilani AAB (Argushiigi
Admegulasha Bilanidin) database – literally the ‘Vilani
Repository of All Knowledge’. During the next two
decades, the IISS essentially took over the planet,
which they renamed Reference, and whose system
was coincidently located nearly exactly on the galactic
plane at what was then the centre of the Imperium,
turning it into the repository of Grand Survey
information. They expanded Reference’s subterranean
vaults to store the information collated from across the
Imperium and beyond.

During the latter 40 years of the Grand Survey,
Emperor Martin III expanded its scope to include
surveying the territories of all the Major Races.
This effort continued beyond the completion of the
Grand Survey and slowly petered out into military
confrontations with Vargr states, the Julian Protectorate
and xenophobic reactions from the K’kree and some
Aslan clans. In the early more ambitious days of the
IISS, long duration deep missions sometimes lasting
decades had blazed narrow trails up to 1,000 parsecs
beyond Imperial territory but the focus towards
completing the survey and the expense of travelling
ever further reduced the emphasis and funding for
these career-long expeditions after 500.

Conflicts with the Zhodani in the first two Frontier Wars,
spanning 589–620 with a brief respite in between, and
the chaotic Civil War of 606–622 strained budgets
all-around. The IISS was neutral for much of the civil
war period, supporting only Emperor Cleon V and then
Arbellatra when she proclaimed her Regency in 622,
but the impetus for exploration was much diminished
and surveying had become routine.

In 624 Arbellatra gave the IISS a new responsibility:
that of maintaining a communications web of jump-vessels, the Express Boat or x-boat, network. This
network led to a proliferation of x-boat waystations
and expansion of scout bases. It also led to a move to
control expenses by standardising common designs
for many of the IISS vessels, including the now iconic
Suleiman-class scout/courier.

The creation of the Communications Office and
supporting infrastructure brought the IISS to its
modern structure and established it as a stabilising

force within the Imperium. Exploration continued
to occur, and the occasional expedition would still
venture far into the unknown, but the IISS’s focus was
closer to home where it was more visible to those who
approved its funding.

By 990 the newly installed Emperor Gavin had two
major issues to confront. The first was the looming
Solomani Rim War which would begin in that year
and drag on until 1002. The second was the state
of survey data, some stagnated for more than five
centuries despite efforts to continue incremental
updates. Emperor Gavin commissioned the IISS to
begin the Second Survey in 990. Given the constraints
of communication lag and war funding, the survey
itself did not begin until 995. This effort was even more
extensive than the First Survey. It covered a larger
Imperium and surrounding sectors and added a focus
on collecting real and facsimile artifacts of the cultures
of more than 11,000 worlds. The survey itself was
completed in 1065 but it took until 1068 for all the data
and artefacts to reach Reference, where they were
displayed in massive edifices dedicated to each of the
Imperium’s 27 sectors and many regions beyond.

The Imperial Interstellar Scout Service continues to
play a major role in Imperial affairs. X-boats and scout/
couriers are omnipresent, survey ships update data
across thousands of systems and news reports of
discoveries of wonders far from Imperial space are
still commonplace. The Scout Service is the nervous
system of the Third Imperium, carrying signals
throughout its body and peering both internally and
externally to keep it healthy.

ORGANISATION


As with any large organisation, the IISS also
requires a large support establishment. The Scout
Service is divided into two main groups of offices,
the bureaucracy, which encompasses most of these
functions, and the field, which includes the operational
purposes of the service: exploration, survey and
communications offices.

FIELD OFFICES


The exploration office is the oldest field office of the Scout
Service, descending directly from the non-commercial half
of the Sylean Federation Scout Service. It is tasked with
exploring areas not yet visited or thoroughly charted and
holds responsibility for the study of the Imperium’s diverse
cultures. These two halves are the exploration branch and
the contact and liaison branch.

IISS Overview

The exploration branch is responsible for actual
exploration of star systems and of other space
phenomena. Its members compile basic data on stars
and their worlds, including planetological features and
local life forms. The exploration branch investigates
and reports on hazards to navigation or other dangers
beyond Imperial borders. As the Third Imperium’s
expansion slowed and abutted against other interstellar
states, the exploration branch’s missions lost their
primacy but it is still active, especially beyond
the Spinward and Trailing frontiers, and conducts
occasional multi-year or multi-decade expeditions deep
into uncharted sectors of space.

The contact and liaison branch was originally charged
with first contact of alien sophonts or long-isolated
human colonies. As the Imperium matured and
distant exploration slowed, it gained responsibility for
cultural relations between the many different sophonts
and cultures of the Imperium. This branch also has
responsibility for disseminating technology to less
advanced worlds in a way that minimises damage to
their civilisations. Some interdicted Red Zones within
the Imperium are under the oversight of the contact
and liaison branch.

The survey office has been officially designated by this
name since 298 but it still prefers its original title, the
Imperial Grand Survey (IGS), and often uses this older
name instead of its official designation. Regardless of
name, it has two branches: the internal mapping branch
and the external mapping branch. Both branches are
responsible for producing and updating charts and
information about star systems and individual worlds.

The internal mapping branch operates within Imperial
borders, ensuring the accuracy of internal charts and
databases and performing mapping duties on planetary
surfaces as necessary. It updates census information
and reports on inhabited worlds' current political
institutions and practices.

The external mapping branch is responsible for areas
outside the Third Imperium’s borders, usually surveying
systems already explored by the exploration branch,
but occasionally visiting systems left behind as ‘less
interesting’. The external branch’s maps are used for
astrogation, settlement or planning and are often vital
for intelligence purposes in times of conflict.

The communications office is the youngest of the field
offices. It is responsible for interstellar messaging and
data flow within the Imperium. With communications
limited to the speed of jump, the communications

office acts as the data network of the Imperium. Its
two branches are the express boat service and the
Imperial courier service.

The express boat service operates the jump-x-boats that are the spine of this Imperium-wide
network. The service provides crews for express
boats and their tenders. Some x-boat routes cross
Imperial borders and continue into neighbouring
client states and neutral territory.

The Imperial courier service operates on feeder
routes off the x-boat network, providing final delivery
of messages and small packages to many of the
Imperium’s worlds. Courier vessels also undertake
special missions to ensure communications and items
reach vital destinations in a timely manner. When scout
vessels are not available or suitable for final delivery,
the Imperial courier service will sometimes contract out
mail delivery to responsible commercial providers.

Most people associate the Scout Service with those
three field offices. These offices are organised to support
a variety of missions and personality types. As such, little
formal structure exists. Individuals form teams based on
the needs of a mission and while experience certainly
matters, mission assignments are based on specialised
skills and an individual’s suitability and experience
required for a successful mission. The field offices
actively recruit from non-human species and more
primitive worlds to garner a broad collection of skills,
knowledge and perspective. Special skills, peer reviews
and personnel availability determine roles within field
offices, not rank or strict seniority.

However, no organisation can exist without some
structure and control. Even in the case of the field
offices, the bureaucracy’s operations office provides
control and direction for field operations.

BUREAUCRACY OFFICES


The bureaucracy is composed of four main offices:
administration, detached duty, technical services
and operations.

The administration office is the back office of the
IISS. Its three branches are personnel, finance and
procurement. These branches are no different than
those found in any large organisation and cover the
activities of active duty scouts, budgets, payments
and the acquisition of everything from office supplies
to starships.

The detached duty office keeps records of all ex-scout personnel. Scouts do not retire but switch to
detached duty status, allowing them to be recalled to

service until the age of 66 and sometimes beyond,
if warranted by special situations. These range from
a general mobilisation in wartime to missions that
require a specific skillset. The detached duty office
is also responsible for the allocation of surplus
IISS craft (usually standard Suleiman-Class scout/
couriers) to ex-scouts to help the IISS achieve its
overall goals. The detached duty office has two
branches: records and intelligence.

The records branch maintains contact information and
other documentation on ex-scouts. They passively
store contact and skillset information for those who
might require recall, and actively monitor those scouts
who are assigned surplus craft.

The intelligence branch is responsible for debriefing
ex-scouts with assigned starships and gathering
information about conditions and events outside
Imperial borders and in backwaters not frequently
visited by commercial vessels. Intelligence also runs
covert agents – sometimes these same detached
scouts on special assignment, but also active duty
intelligence branch agents – to gather information
and perform covert operations in support of Imperial
interests beyond the Third Imperium’s borders.

The technical services office is responsible for scientific
and technical activities within the service. Its two
branches are the education branch and the research
and development branch.

The education branch, also called ‘the school’,
provides training materials and courses and is
responsible for the dissemination of data between
scout bases and Reference. It provides standardised
tests for scout personnel to ensure their skillsets are
up to date and verifiable. Field personnel are able
to take courses on any topic during their downtime
between missions or while in jump space travelling
between systems. Bureaucracy staff also have access
to these courses but in a more rigid and limited
fashion pertaining to their job descriptions.

The research and development branch is responsible
for analysing data gathered by field operations and
for development of specialised equipment, programs
and procedures required for scientific missions.
This branch also designs specialised scout vessels
required to operate under unusual field conditions
and environments. Research work at the frontiers of
science is often conducted by its personnel, who are
sometimes recruited from field office scouts. Some
Imperial research stations are under the authority of the
research and development branch.

The operations office is responsible for keeping the
Scout Service running. Its branches are maintenance,
security, base and scout fleet.

The maintenance branch is responsible for repairs
and preventive maintenance of all IISS equipment.
Maintenance branch personnel are also trained
to maintain Imperial Navy assets if necessary,
especially in times of war. Detached-duty scouts in
possession of scout ships may use maintenance
facilities and crews at cost.

The security branch provides security and law
enforcement for the Scout Service. This branch conducts
base security, internal police and investigative duties.
The security branch also provides shipboard troops and
commandos for certain scout operations and maintains
agents for covert and special operations. Security
branch agents have the authority to enforce Imperial
law, giving them broad authorisation to arrest, detain or
interrogate individuals and conduct investigations into
possible violations of Imperial laws. They can demand
cooperation from local authorities as needed. The
security branch is responsible for the active enforcement
of IISS-initiated Red Zone interdictions.

A small elite group with the branch, the special security
service, or S3, is responsible for the recovery of scout
personnel and equipment captured or lost to hostile
control. An even more elite group is the Scout Service
Imperial Protection Detail, whose sole function is to
prevent the assassination of the Emperor.

The base branch is responsible for the operation of
all scout bases, waystations and other installations,
supervising personnel from other bureaucracy and field
offices as needed. Often staffed locally, this branch can
act as an entry point into the Scout Service for natives
of the host world of the scout facility.

The scout fleet has authority over all of the active-duty
spacecraft operated by the Scout Service. These ships
are all theoretically assigned to numbered scout fleets
and loaned to other offices. The ships assigned to
field offices are assigned by the scout fleet, even if not
crewed by fleet personnel, although some ships have
fleet operators as part of their crew.

Whether part of the bureaucracy or the field, the many
offices and branches of the Imperial Interstellar Scout
Service work together across Imperial Space and
beyond to conduct many missions and operations
important to the functioning and growth of the Third
Imperium. The Scout Service remains the eyes, ears,
nerves and memory of the Imperium.

IISS Overview



SURVEY OPERATIONS


Despite the name, both the exploration and survey
office perform survey operations. The exploration
branch has a motto of ‘First In’ and usually conducts
the initial in-system study of a previously unexplored
star system. The depth of knowledge gained by these
explorers is often focused on certain aspects of a
system, such as the lifeforms – intelligent or otherwise

- of habitable or inhabited worlds and any unusually
or interesting phenomena, whether within a system or
the depths of interstellar space. The end result of these
investigations may be very deep in certain aspects but
might consist of only summary data for some regions
or features of the star system’s overall composition.
Larger exploration missions often have personnel
with broad enough expertise to cover a system to
an acceptable level of detail, but smaller expeditions
leave many bits of data for others to fill in. Likewise,
an uninteresting and uninhabited star system may only
receive a cursory remote scan if it is merely a refuelling
waypoint on the way to the mission objective.

It is the responsibility of the survey office and its
external and internal mapping branches to ensure
these blanks are filled in and that initial data is later
checked for changes or errors. The survey office is
more methodical – explorers would say stodgy – in their
approach, making sure checklists are complete and
every world receives at least the proper minimum level
of scrutiny. While the exploration office often receives
notice for exciting discoveries, it is survey office charts
that pave the way for the Imperium to follow.

Survey missions have procedural checklists and
specific data requirements. These have long been
grouped into standardised survey classifications as
described on the Survey Classes table.

The two Grand Surveys conducted between 300–
and 995–1065 compiled Class IV surveys of all
Imperial systems and many beyond its borders.
Most Imperial-visited systems across Charted Space
have been subject to at least one Class III survey
over the course of Imperial history. Class V surveys
are normally only conducted on systems with local
sophont inhabitants, or which are targeted for
colonisation or other development. Chapters within
this book will detail procedures and outcomes for
surveys of various classes.

One general outcome of surveys is an increase in
standardised survey information referred to as the
Survey Index. A summary of data available at each
survey index value and the survey class required
to collect that data is described in the Survey Index
table. Note that a preliminary Class 0 survey contains
information often gathered at a considerable distance
by remote observation, using large telescopes and
techniques such as interstellar-scale baseline arrays
and sophisticated data analysis. This data provides
information for astronomical data for many distant
systems never visited by the Scout Service.

The IISS provides standardised forms for gathering
survey data. Class 0 and I surveys utilise a very
simple format, Class II and III surveys use a form
which superficially covers all of the bodies in a
system. A Class IV survey form is a deeper analysis
of all aspects of one world. A Class V form is a table
of contents for a report that often runs thousands
of pages and contains exabytes of supplementary
material. The book provides blanks and examples of
the Class 0, I, II/III and IV survey forms.

IISS Overview

A parsec-sized hex on a Traveller sector or subsector
map can contain at most one star system. The
probability of a hex containing a star system is
determined by the world occurrence procedure from
page 246 of the Traveller Core Rulebook, with a default
50% chance of a system being present, subject to
density modifiers discussed on that page and in more
detail in the Sector Construction Guide on pages
9-12. Determining the stellar density of a region is
outside the scope of this book, which focuses on the
detailing of the resultant system within the hex itself.
However, non-standard occurrences of objects such as
star clusters and what actually occupies those empty
hexes is covered in detail in the Special Circumstances
chapter of this book.

STAR CLASSIFICATION


Astronomers categorise stars by their spectral type, in
categories which generally correspond to their spectra,
temperatures and luminosity class, which generally
relates to their brightness.

Spectral types for most stars, from hottest to coolest
are O, B, A, F, G, K, and M. Each of these types has a
numeric subtype ranging hottest to coolest from 0 to 9.
Various additional spectral type modifiers, from fractional
numeric to special alphabetic codes are sometimes
appended to stars but for Traveller purposes these
seven spectral letter types followed by a single-digit
numeric subtype are sufficient. Brown dwarfs, bodies
not large enough to fuse standard hydrogen, expand
spectral codes to L, T, and Y, and some large, young
brown dwarfs actually cross into the M spectral class,
but unless the Referee wishes to teach an astronomy
symposium, such technicalities are beyond the scope
of this generation system. For the purposes of standard
Traveller data formats, all brown dwarfs are treated as
the special class BD with no luminosity class listed.

Luminosity classes are expressed as Roman numerals,
with the brightest class, I, appending a Latin letter
extension of ‘a’ or ‘b’. With the exception of some
hypergiants too rare to consider in this process which
are class 0 or Ia+ (but again, this is not an astronomy
symposium) the brightest supergiant stars are Class
Ia, with Class Ib being the dimmer class of supergiant.
Class II are bright giant stars, Class III are normal giant

# S TARS

stars, Class IV are subgiant stars and Class V are main
sequence stars, the most common variety of stars, also
referred to as ‘dwarf’ stars. Class VI is a subdwarf – less
bright than a regular dwarf. A Class VII designation is
reserved for white dwarf stars but these are generally
referred to as spectral class D with various follow-on
capital letters denoting spectral anomalies based on their
composition. Again, for the purpose of Traveller, all white
dwarfs are treated as class D with no additional letters or
luminosity class listed.

Most stars similar in size to Sol are Class V main
sequence stars. Towards the end of their lives as they
exhaust their reserves of hydrogen to provide fusion,
these stars will leave the main sequence, brightening to
become subgiants (IV) and then becoming giants (III)
as they begin to fuse helium into carbon. After a period
of time as giants – with various subphases and periods
of variability and massive expulsions of gas – those
stars with less than eight times Sol’s mass remaining
will shed their outer layers, briefly hosting a planetary
nebula (which is not a planet at all) and then settle into
eternity as a white dwarf, slowly cooling for billions of
years. A star’s lifespan in the main sequence can be as
short as a few million years for the massive and bright
O-type stars or it can be trillions of years for the low
mass and dim M-types.

More massive stars – those with more than eight
times Sol’s mass at the end of their giant phase – will
end their lives in massive supernova explosions,
leaving behind either a neutron star, a black hole, or
sometimes nothing at all.

PRIMARY STAR


A star system has one or more stars. For the
generation of a new system, the first step is the
determination of the system’s primary star. More than
half of all star systems contain more than one star and
of these, the primary star is considered the one that is
the most massive. In most cases it is also the brightest
star in the system.

Most stars will be small main sequence stars with
straightforward generation procedures. The special
cases requiring extra detail are the rare bright stars,
giants and unusual objects.

PRIMARY STAR TYPES


To determine the type of the primary star roll 2D on the Star Type Determination table and consult the Type column.

In reality, brown dwarfs may be as or more common
than all hydrogen-fusing stars and white dwarfs may
account for 1/6 or more of all primary stars in systems
but in Charted Space they are not present in many
detailed sectors and underrepresented in the others. If
the Referee chooses to include these as primary stars
in some systems, they should choose the Unusual
column, if not, the Special column does not include
these stars as primary but it does not preclude them
from being present as additional stars within a system.

Brighter, more massive stars (A-type+) are rarer than
the smaller M-types. On a roll of 12, roll 2D again and
consult the Hot column to determine the star’s type.

A roll of 2 indicates a special system. This includes all
systems whose primary stars are not main sequence
stars. Referees should decide for their universe
whether to include brown dwarfs and white dwarfs as
primary stars, as opposed to relegating these objects

- not truly stars as they do not fuse hydrogen – to
secondary (or tertiary, etc.) members of a star system.



Any result starting with Class requires a second roll on
the Type column with DM+1. Additionally, Class IV and
VI stars are limited in their range of types:
•	 Class IV is limited to types B0 to K4. Add 5 to any
rolled result ofM (3-6) on the Type roll and change
any result of O to B on an Hot roll.
•	 Class VI is comprised of two separate populations,
but neither include type F or A. Treat results of F as
G and A as B.

A result of Class III+ requires a roll in the giants column
to determine the final luminosity class of the star,
followed by a roll on the type column with DM+1.

OPTIONAL VARIANT


This process skews more towards traditional Traveller
star type frequencies than nature provides. A more
realistic type column would have 3-8=M, 9=K, 10=G,
11=F. Or, just as Traveller presents the universe as
a two-dimensional space of quantised parsecs, the
Referee can keep the tables as presented and assume
many colder M-type systems are underrepresented.

PECULIAR STAR TYPES


A result of 2 on the Unusual column requires more work
on the part of the Referee. This is an unlikely result
and often only suitable for the expanded method of
system generation, as it does not lend itself to standard
mainworld generation. These results are treated in
greater depth in the Special Circumstances chapter
starting on page 219.

If this result occurs for a primary star, the Referee may
choose to ignore the result and roll again or instead
resolve the unusual result with 1D, with a result of 1–
meaning neutron star and 6 resulting in black hole.

A nebula is a dense region of interstellar gas. It could
be a planetary nebula around a recently formed white
dwarf, or a black cloud contracting to form a new star. A
nebula may span multiple hexes.

A protostar is an early phase of star formation, a star
just beginning to burn, subject to chaotic fluctuations
in radiation and temperatures, surrounded by rings
of protoplanetary debris. Protostars could be entirely
enshrouded in a nebula or exposed to the universe as
T Tauri or Herbig Ae/Be stars – ostensibly similar to
a main sequence star but with varying characteristics
and no fully formed planets. Roll again on the column
of the Star Type table Determination with DM+1 to
determine protostar type. Change any result of O-type
to B-type to avoid large protostars – these rare and

massive stars pass into the main sequence too quickly
to pass through a protostar phase. If a primary star is a
protostar, then any other stars in the same system are
also protostars. If the primary star is not a protostar,
then no subsequently determined stars in the system
can be protostars.

A star cluster is a dense nursery of stars and may
include nebula, protostars, main sequence stars, giant
stars and brown dwarfs. The members of a star cluster
may number in the dozens or hundreds, all within one
parsec or a multi-parsec region of space.

A result of anomaly can be anything the Referee
decides: hypothetical exotic stars (quark, strange,
electroweak, dark matter, and so on), alien
megastructures, wormholes, star gods and so forth.

SUBTYPES


The subtype, or numeric value of the star type can be
determined one of two ways:

1. As a straight 0–9 value
2. Using the Star Subtype table and choosing the
    Numeric or M-type column as appropriate (but if
    also optionally using rolls of 3–9 for M-types use a
    straight 0–9 for M subtypes). The M-type column is
    appropriate for Primary M-type stars, but additional
    M-types in a system should use the Numeric
    column or a straight 0–9 for subtype.

Star Subtype
2D Numeric M-type (Primary only)
2 0 8
3 1 6
4 3 5
5 5 4
6 7 0
7 9 2
8 8 1
9 6 3
10 4 5
11 2 7
12 0 9

For a K-type Class IV star, subtract5 (make lower) any
subtype result above 4.

Here we begin a running in-line example of a star
system named ‘Zed’ in the distant Storr sector. To begin
this example, the roll for primary star is a 9, resulting in
a type G-type main sequence, Class V star. A 2D roll of

stars

6 on the Star Subtype table using the Numeric column
for a non-M-type star results in a subtype 7, making the
primary star a G7 V. (Had it been a type-M-type star,
the same 2D roll of 6 on the M-type column would have
resulted in a M0 V star.)

STAR MASS AND TEMPERATURE


The Star Mass and Temperature by Class table
provides approximate values for a star’s mass in units
of Sol’s mass, , and associated surface temperature.
This table lists the values for numeric 0 and5 (and
9 for M-type) subtypes, but masses between these
entries can be extrapolated or estimated. The values
presented are not absolute limits or precise; the
specific trace element composition of a star can vary
in the mass of a particular type, as can its variation
from a standard luminosity class. A variance of
20% from the listed or extrapolated values for any
particular star’s mass is not unreasonable; for giant
stars the variance from the standard could exceed
50%. The upper limit for the most massive supergiant
stars could be as high as 300 or more; the lower
limit for hydrogen fusion is normally around 0.08 but
could dip lower, depending on composition.

The major determinant for the subtype of a star is
its temperature. Actual temperature values can be
extrapolated from the table below but should not
be varied outside the range for that stellar subtype,
although linear variability within that range is possible.

Zed, the example type G7 V star, falls between G
and K0 or a mass range of 0.9 to 0.8, a difference
of 0.1. By treating a K0 V as a ‘G10 V’ the math
becomes clearer: a G7 is 2/5 of the difference
between the larger and smaller value or .04 less
than 0.9, giving it a base mass of 0.86. To add an
optional 20% variance, roll 2D-7. A roll of 9–7 results
in a +2 out of a possible range of +5. So, it is 40% of
the variance of 20% of 0.86. This is 0.4 times 0.
(which is 0.2 × 0.86) or 0.0688, which is then added to
0.86 to become 0.9288, rounded to 0.929.

Zed’s temperature is also possible to interpolate as
the difference between a G5 V and a K0 V star but a
broad variance should not be applied to this value. The
difference between 5,600 and 5,200 is 400, and Zed
is 40% of 400K cooler than a G5 V or 5,440K. If the
Referee should decide to add a variance, it should be
no more than half of the difference between a G7 and a
G6 or a G8, so 5,440 +40, with a linear variance being
more appropriate.

UNUSUAL AND PECULIAR OBJECT MASS


If a star is defined as a hydrogen fusing object (standard hydrogen composed of one proton and
no neutrons), then objects such as brown dwarfs,
white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes are not
technically stars. All of these items are covered in
greater detail in the Special Circumstances chapter
starting on page 219. If these objects are the primary or
only star, the procedures in that chapter should govern

Companion stars, consult the Special Circumstances
chapter for mass and temperature specifics.

STAR DIAMETER


The diameter of a star affects its luminosity, as a larger
surface area at the same temperature puts out more
energy. The same variances optionally applied to star
mass can apply to the values in the Star Diameter by
Class table page 19.

Note that most of this book’s text will refer to diameter
instead of radius. Diameter is used to ease calculation
of jump distances but radius is more often used
in physics-based formulas. As the base values for
these are 1 in either case, the actual usage is
often equivalent (in the text, not in actual distance).
However, a measure that can become important
for large stars and/or closely orbiting planets is the
radius of the star itself. In most cases, no planet can
survive inside the surface of a star. The radius of Sol
is 695,700km or 0.00465AU.

The G7 V star Zed might be a little more massive
than normal but its diameter is independently based
on its class. It is again 2/5 of the way between a G
V diameter of 0.95 and a K0 V diameter of 0.9. This
results in a base diameter calculation of 0.93 for Zed.
Adding a 20% variance roll of (2D-7) results in +1 and
adds 1/5 of 20% of 0.93 to the diameter to bring it to
0.9672 or 0.967.

UNUSUAL AND PECULIAR OBJECT DIAMETER


Non-stellar objects have diameters that do not necessarily
follow a clear relationship between mass and diameter.
Detailed information on these object’s properties is
included in the Special Circumstances chapter.

STAR LUMINOSITY


A star’s luminosity is its brightness and energy output.
For the purpose of determining the habitable zone, this
includes all wavelengths of light. O-type and B-type
stars radiate much of their energy in the ultraviolet and
M-type much of their energy in the infrared. At these
extremes much of the energy will not be visible to a
human observer. The total, or bolometric, luminosity
is what will determine the energy output of a star and
therefore the location of the habitable zone where the
environment is comfortable for human life.

STELLAR 100D JUMP LIMITS
Traditionally in Traveller, the jump shadow of a star is
based on its diameter, however while this works well
from most main sequence stars, it can produce odd
results at the extremes, as when considering stars
such as white dwarfs heavier than Sol but smaller in
size than Luna, not to mention black holes only a few
kilometres across with a mass of two or more suns.
At the other end of the spectrum are giant (Class III)
stars that are often little more massive than Sol but
have diameters as much as 100 times greater. At
certain late stages in these star’s lives, they become
variable, with widely fluctuating diameters.

The Referee can choose to deal with such
situations in one of three methods:

1. Use stellar diameters exclusively, regardless
    of mass. This will make 100D jumps available
    very close to black holes, white dwarfs and
    other such objects and very far away from all
    giant class stars.
2. Use mass instead of diameter as the ‘100D’
    jump shadow with value for a one Sol mass
    star equal to 0.93 Astronomical Units (AU) or
    about 139 million kilometres. This will result
    in a consistent jump shadow over the life of a
    star (mass loss at the end of its giant phase will
    cause some contraction).
3. As some instances of method two may result
    in the 100D limit being near or inside the
    photosphere of a swollen red giant, instead the
    surface of a giant star could be considered to
    be the start of the jump shadow. In this case,
    the shadow can be computed as Star Mass
    distance (from method two) + Star Diameter
    for just giant stars or for all stars (the latter
    will push the 100D limit out by 0.5D or about
    700,000 kilometres for a Sol-massed main
    sequence star).

The Star Luminosity by Class table provides luminosity
values typical for a star of the indicated type and class.
Actual luminosity values can have a variance of 30%
or more. For Class III giant stars, luminosity can vary
by even greater amounts late in its giant phase, with
an upper bound nearly 100 times the table’s value with
considerable variability.

LUMINOSITY FORMULA


A more accurate method of determining luminosity that
is directly related to a star’s diameter and temperature
is to use the formula:

The value for diameter in this formula is in solar units.
The temperature (T) of Sol is 5,772K, but can be
rounded to 5,800. This formula results directly from
underlying physics and pre-determined values, so it is
neither necessary or appropriate to apply a variance to
the formula-derived value.

For this example, Zed’s luminosity can be determined
two ways, by formula or by chart. By formula, Zed’s
diameter is 0.967 and Zed’s temperature of 5,440
divided by the Sol standard of 5,772 results in:

Luminosity = (0.967 ÷ 1)^2 × (5440 ÷ 5772)^4 = 0.7378

This rounds to 0.74 or 0.738. Notice the advantage of
using Sol-based units for diameter in this calculation;
in future examples a denominator of 1 will be omitted
for brevity.

Using the table instead, Zed falls between 0.78 and
0.52. Its interpolated value is 0.52 + (0.78 - 0.52) ×
0.6 or 0.676 rounded to 0.68. This is a smaller value
than the computed value but the table allows for a 30%
variance, allowing the luminosity to be computed as
high as 0.88. However, the computed value considers
the established diameter, temperature variance and is
more consistent, so it will be used in the example.

UNUSUAL AND PECULIAR OBJECT LUMINOSITY


As with regular stars, the luminosity of an unusual
object is related to its diameter and temperature.
Protostars should determine luminosity based on their
temperature and diameter using the luminosity formula
in the same manner as normal stars. For other objects
the formula remains the same but information such as
the object’s age and the brightness of other objects in
orbit can influence the object’s temperature effect on
surrounding bodies. See the Special Circumstances
chapter for specific details.

SYSTEM AGE


In most cases, the Primary star determines the
system’s age, the exception being when subsequent
stars created in the same system are determined to be
post-stellar objects such as white dwarfs, neutron stars
or black holes. In that exception, post-stellar objects set
the parameters for the minimum age of the system.

MAIN SEQUENCE LIFESPAN


Technically only Class V stars are main sequence
stars but the ‘normal’ phase of a star’s life is
similarly determined for Class Ia, Ib, II, V and VI
stars. The major determination for main sequence
lifespan is mass. A star of one solar mass will spend
approximately 10 billion years on the main sequence.
Going forward, for brevity, the term billion years may
be abbreviated as Gyrs or Gyr for giga-year. The
relationship between mass and lifespan on the main
sequence is approximately:

This means a star with a mass of 20 will spend only
six million years in the main sequence while one of
mass 0.1 will last for more than three trillion years. As
the universe is only 13.8 billion years old and the oldest
stars are perhaps 13.5, even the first stars of less than
about 0.89 – essentially G6 V or cooler – have not
yet left the main sequence.

Different galaxies experience star formation at different
rates at different times but for Traveller purposes, star
formation rates are considered flat or constant, and
stars in their main sequence phase are considered to be
randomly aged within that timespan in a linear fashion.
The Referee can modify these assumptions as they see
fit. The galaxy is thought to be 13 billion years old. Any
normal star of mass less than 0.9 – which is by far the
majority of stars in the galaxy, have been in the main
sequence for between 0.1 and 12 billion years.

To randomly determine this age, roll 1D and multiply
by 2. Then roll D3-1 and add that value to the first
roll. This sum is the star’s age in billions of years. Roll
d10 to add additional digits the age number if greater
detail is desired but if doing so, also subtract one
billion years from the result:

### ( ) ( )

Diameter
Diameter

Temperature
Temperature

2 4

**_Main Sequence Lifespan_** **=** Gyr

10
Mass 2.5

Adding additional digits of accuracy requires additional
d10 rolls. Most star system ages will not be known to
an accuracy of better than millions of years or three
significant digits, whichever is more accurate. A remote
Class 0 or I survey from outside the system will rarely
achieve more than two digit accuracy.

Larger stars, those of mass above 0.9, cannot use
this formula directly, although for stars of moderately
larger mass the Referee may choose to use it and
discard values outside the lifespan bounds. Instead,
directly determine the portion of main sequence
lifespan experienced by the star using linear variance:

Using multiple d10 to emulate d100 or even d1000 will
allow for greater detail, if desired.

Any star with a mass of less than 4.7 should use 0.01
Gyr as a minimum age value; anything younger would
be a protostar. Stars of mass 4.7 or larger effectively
skip the protostar stage, going straight into their
Primordial system stage.

For all stars, a result of less than 0.1 Gyr results in a
primordial system. See the Special Circumstances
Primordial Systems section beginning on page 225 for
primordial system effects.

**ALTERNATE AGING**
Alternatively, the Referee may wish to determine age
by considering any variation in luminosity from the
main sequence standard tables to be an approximate
age indicator, with the standard value defining lifespan
midpoint and brighter stars indicating older stars in
accordance with the variance range and dimmer stars
similarly indicating younger stars. This book does not

dwell on detailed calculations of changes to luminosity
from age, stellar metal content or other factors, but the
Referee can implement this to the degree desired.

Additionally, if a system developed by the
continuation method is known to host a native
sophont species, the Referee may choose to make
the system at least two (possibly three) billion years
old to give the biosphere of the mainworld enough
time to evolve the necessary complexity.

The example star Zed with a mass of 0.929 is just large
enough to have had a chance to become a subgiant
during the lifespan of the universe. Zed’s computed
lifespan is 10 ÷ 0.9292.5 or 12.022 billion years. This
is long enough that the Referee can determine Zed’s
actual age using the method for slightly smaller stars
and ignoring a result of 6 on the 1D roll. Rolling a 3,
and then rolling D3-1 for a result of 1 makes Zed about
3 × 2 +1 or 7 billion years old. To achieve another digit
of accuracy a d10 roll results in a 3 but this added
accuracy also involves subtracting one from the initial
result, giving Zed a final age of 6.3 billion years.
Additional accuracy requires in-system sampling as
part of a Class II survey but rather than revisiting age
at a later date the Referee rolls d10 twice to add 36
million years to the systems age, making it 6.336 billion
years old – although this accuracy would only show up
on a Class II or more detailed survey form.

SUBGIANT (CLASS IV) LIFESPAN
Class IV stars have completed their main sequence
lifespan and are on their way towards becoming a true
giant star. There is no easy method to determine the
lifespan of a star as a subgiant, although more massive
stars spend increasingly shorter periods of time in this
phase. For simplicity, apply the following approximate
formula for total time a star spends as a subgiant:

Next determine the star’s fraction of time spent in the
subgiant phase. This linear variation can be determined
by dividing the subgiant lifespan by 1D, 1D-1+1D÷6,
d10, or d100 as desired.

Alternatively, the Referee could rule that any
predetermined variation from standard subgiant
luminosity influences the age, with brighter stars being
older. In either case, the total age for the Class IV star is:

GIANT (CLASS III) LIFESPAN
Main sequence stars end their fusing era years as Class
III giant stars. The giant phase of a star’s life is actually
quite dramatic, with luminosity generally brightening over
age but being subject to large variations. For simplicity,
treat the star’s giant lifespan as:

The elapsed fractional period of the star’s giant phase
is determined in a linear fashion as above but stronger
consideration should be given to the star’s luminosity,
with significant brightening occurring late in the giant
phase. Extra complications such a mass loss late in the
giant phase are beyond the scope of this description. A
giant’s total age can be computed as:

FINAL AGE


Stars that have evolved into white dwarfs or more
exotic dead star objects should consider the total age
prior to the death of a star. The mass of these remnant
objects is between one-third and one-fifth of the mass
of their progenitor star, so to determine a previous
lifetime, multiply the mass of these dead stars by 2
+ D3 before computing lifespans for input into the
following formula:

Or, more concisely:

The value of (D3+2) × dead star mass is used for post-stellar objects to account for the mass loss associated
with their death. However, the progenitor star must
have begun life with at least enough mass to create
the proper type of object. For a neutron star, this mass
value must be at least 8 and for a black hole it should
be at least 20. In all cases, objects should be less
than 13.8 billion years old. Unless the Referee wants to
create an anomaly.

UNUSUAL AND PECULIAR OBJECT AGE


Sub-stellar objects such as brown dwarfs can be as old
as the universe. As such, the small star age formula can
determine age. Post stellar objects should consider two
ages: the final age of the progenitor star and the age of
the post-stellar object. The former is only really relevant
in systems with multiple stars where smaller members
are still in early phases of their existence. For post stellar
objects, pulsars usually last for less than about 100
million years before becoming ‘normal’ neutron stars.
Other post-stellar objects can be almost as old as the
oldest stars and so can use the small star range.

SYSTEMS WITH MULTIPLE STARS


Most stars exist as part of a system with more
than one star. Binary stars are very common but
astronomers have discovered systems of up to seven
stars. This book’s methodology allows for up to eight
stars to exist in a single system. In reality, multiple
star systems exist in a hierarchy or tree-like structure,
usually with single or pairs of stars orbiting each other
and their common centre of mass – their barycentre –
possibly in turn orbiting around another single or pair
of stars’ barycentre. More massive stars orbit near the
centre of this configuration, with less massive stars or
star pairs further out.

While this representation is technically correct, it
introduces unnecessary complications without adding
much to the system creation processes except more
maths, which after considerably more effort will provide
similar results. A Referee is free to modify this book’s
processes to build a barycentre-based system but
for the purposes of this generation methodology and
to maintain some compatibility with earlier Traveller
versions and T5, the primary star will represent the
centre of the system and define its core orbital structure
and all other stars or star pairs will orbit it.

**NUMBER OF STARS**
More massive stars are more likely to be members
of a multiple star system but a system can include a
variety of objects. The basic simplifying assumption
of the star system generation is that the primary
star is the most massive in the system. For logical
simplification, additional stars may circle this primary
star in orbits characterised as Close, Near and Far.
Each star – including the primary – may have a
companion star in very close orbit to it. The presence
of a star at these locations is determined by the
Multiple Stars Presence table. The chance of a star
occupying any of these positions is only modified by
the properties of the primary star.

Roll for a companion star presence for the primary
and for any star determined to be present in the
Close, Near or Far orbit classes. Those stars that are
not the primary star or companions of other stars will
sometimes be referred to as the secondary stars of
the system.

The G7 V star Zed has no modifications to the multiple
star presence rolls. The Referee first rolls to see if there
are any secondary stars, with the first 2D roll resulting
in a 4, which indicates no Close star, then rolling a 10
which indicates a Near star, and finally an 11, indicating
a Far secondary star.

For each of these three existing stars, the Referee rolls
again for companion stars. The results of these rolls are
11, which indicates the primary star has a companion,
then a roll of 9 indicates no companion for the Near
star and finally, a roll of 10 indicates the Far star has a
companion. Zed is a quintuple star system.

LOCATION OF STARS IN EXISTING SYSTEMS (CONTINUATION METHOD ONLY)
Some existing systems will have multiple stars already
indicated but no information on their relative location. This
is true for most systems published on Travellermap.com.
A further investigation of the system on the Traveller Wiki
may indicate pre-existing locations for these stars but
most entries do not include this information. To determine
the orbit class of the second star in a binary system, roll
1D and consult the following table:

Existing Star Locations (Binaries)
1D Orbit Class
1 Companion (of primary)
2 Close*
3 Near
4 Far
5 Roll again or companion if same Class and Type
6 Roll again
* Stars of class Ia, Ib, II and III cannot have Close
secondary stars

The term ‘same Class and Type’ means that the listed
non-primary star has the same Class and Type (but not
necessarily subtype number) as the primary star.

Systems with three or more stars need additional rolls
for tertiary, quaternary or even quinary or later stars.
Roll again with a slightly modified table:

Existing Star Locations (Three or more Stars)
1D Orbit Class
1 Companion (of Primary)
2 Close
3 Near
4 Far
5 Roll again or Companion of same Class and Type
6 Far

If the orbit class is already occupied, make the star
a companion of that orbit class’s star. If a companion
class is already present, move out one orbit class (Close to Near to Far) until an open orbit class is
available. For instance, a duplicate companion of the
primary would become a Close star; if Close were
occupied, it would become a companion of the Close
star and if that were occupied it would become a Near
star, and so on. A result of 5 will result in the star
being a companion of any previously determined star
of the same Class and Type, assuming it does not
already have a companion. If this procedure causes a
star to be ‘pushed’ beyond the ‘slot’ for a companion
of the Far star, then start again at the closest open
slot from the primary and move outward until a vacant
position is available.

ORBIT# OVERVIEW
A star’s initial location within the system is based
on Traveller Orbit Numbers – hereafter referred
to as Orbit#s. These arbitrary locations originally
corresponded roughly to locations of planets in the
Solar System and to an 18th century mathematical
relationship known as the Titus-Bode law, which was
no law at all but a mathematical formula which roughly
corresponded to most solar system planetary orbits.
While these Orbit numbers do not work well for actual
planetary orbits in other solar systems (or even Sol’s),
they continue to be useful for placement of stars.
Fractional versions of these Orbit#s are still useful
for describing planetary orbital relationships. With a
considerable Traveller history and lore associated
with Orbit#s, they form a basis for describing star

stars


DEFAULT STAR DESIGNATIONS


In multiple star systems, the stars are designated
alphabetically. For a binary star system, the
primary star is always star A and the secondary,
regardless of its status is star B. For systems
with three or more stars (trinary, quaternary,
quinary, and so on), designation becomes more
complex. Companion stars are relegated to lower
case b designations appended to their direct
primary’s designation, while their primary gets an
upper case followed by a lower case a. Close,
Near or Far stars are given an appended lower
case a designation if they have a companion
or keep their upper case designation if they are
‘alone’. The combined stars with companions
are indicated by an upper case letter followed
by an ab designation. Planetary orbits that
encompass multiple stars use a combination of
all of the stars inside their orbit. The following
table provides an illustration of a sextuple system
with a primary and its companion, a Close star, a
Near star with a companion and a Far star.

In the primary-centric procedures of this book,
when a companion exists unless the stars are
very dim, neither the companion or its parent
star normally have orbits associated with them
individually, so in the example Aa, Ab, Ca,
and Cb are not typically used alone but only
in the combinations: Aab and Cab. Likewise,
depending on spacing, a combination such as
CabD (abbreviated to CD) could theoretically
exist but such a situation is not covered by these
system generation rules. If the Referee chooses
to introduce such possible orbits, a secondary
multi-star orbit designation procedure would
need to be inserted into the process.

kilometres. The relationship between these values is

The Difference (AU) column provides the difference
between the current Orbit# and the next, allowing
easier computation of fractional, or decimal orbits,
e.g., Orbit# 0.1 would be 0.4 × 0.1 or 0.04AU. The
Million Km column indicates the distance in millions of
kilometres of the orbit from the centre of the star.

FRACTIONAL ORBIT#S
To determine fractional Orbit#s, the whole number
Orbit# (Orbit #.00) is considered the start of an
Orbit#. For Orbit# 1 and above a linear variance can
be simulated with d10 (with 0 = 10) by dividing the
result by 10 and adding this value to Orbit# – 1 + 0.5.
For instance, Orbit#2 with fractional variance would
become Orbit#1.5 + d10 ÷ 10.

Orbit# 0 is treated differently as 0 is the minimum value.
For an Orbit# 0 fractional range, the roll is 0 + d10 ÷
20, giving a range of Orbit # 0.00 to 0.50. Some tightly
packed star systems may have all of the worlds in the
Orbit# zero range, so this Orbit# can be divided into
100 ths. Any Orbit# can have add an extra d10 ÷ 100 to
the result to provide a two digit fractional value.

FRACTIONAL ORBIT# CONVERSION TO AU
As Orbit#s are of unequal sizes, determining the
distance of a fractional Orbit# from a star in AUs
requires interpolation between two Orbit#s. The
distance in AU is equal to the whole number Orbit#
plus the difference between the whole number Orbit#
and the next highest Orbit# (this is the Difference (AU)
value on the Orbit# table) times the fractional portion
of the Orbit#:

For instance, an Orbit# of 4.3 is equal to 1.6 (Orbit
#4) + 1.2 (Orbit#4’s Difference(AU) column value)
× 0.3 or 1.96AU. To determine the orbital distance
in kilometres, multiply by 150 million or by the more
precise AU to kilometre value given in the Base Units
table on page 5.

stars

AU = Distance (AU) column for whole Orbit# +
Difference (AU) column x Fractional value

**AU CONVERSION TO FRACTIONAL ORBIT#**
To convert an AU value back to an Orbit# requires
a check of the Orbit# table to find the greatest full
Orbit# that the AU value exceeds, e.g., 3.4 AU would
exceed Orbit# 5. The remainder AU value above that
full Orbit# divided by the Difference (AU) column value
for that Orbit# is the fractional part of Orbit# value. For
instance, 3.4 - 2.8 (the AU value of Orbit# 5) = 0.6 and
0.6 ÷ 2.4 = 0.25, therefore 3.4AU would have an Orbit#
value of 5.25. To summarise, with ‘Full Orbit#’ defined
as the largest full Orbit# exceeded:

ECCENTRICITY


The star orbit generation method assumes roughly
circular orbits. Real star orbits are often far from circular.
Eccentricity is a measure of variation in an orbit, from
0 (circular) to1 (no longer an orbit but a parabolic
approach fading off to infinity – values greater than 1.0
indicate a hyperbolic orbit of an unbound interstellar
object). Adding orbital eccentricity is optional; it adds
realism but also complicates systems dramatically.

Simulating the range and distribution of possible
eccentricity for orbits of any object in a system requires
a first and second roll on the Eccentricity Values table.
The first 2D determines a base value and has various
DMs based on the characteristics of the orbit or type of
body. The second 1D or 2D roll determines the added
value to compute the actual eccentricity. The Referee is
free to avoid over-precision and treat all eccentricities
derived from a first 2D roll result of 5 or less as an
eccentricity of exactly 0. The Referee could also
choose to apply a linear variance achieve up to three
digits of accuracy for eccentricity results. Values should
never exceed 0.999 and can never be below 0.

**STELLAR ORBIT#S**
For system generation purposes, all stellar Orbit#s in
a multi-star system are assumed to circle the primary
star, except companion stars, whose Orbit#s are based
on their parents, whether the primary, Close, Near or
Far. This is a schematic of convenience, not a strict
representation of the system itself. Non-primary star
Orbit#s are determined as:

Stellar Orbit# Ranges

Close 1D-1* 0.5–5 0.2–4.0
Near 1D+5 6–11 4.0–231

Companion† 1D÷10 +
(2D-7)÷100

0.05–0.65 0.02–0.26

*A result of 0 = Orbit# 0.5 or 0.2AU
†Companions of giants (Ia, Ib, II or III) have Orbit# equal
to 1D x MAO of the Primary star (see page 39)

A companion star has a fractional Orbit# variance built
into its determination. Adding a fractional Orbit# variance
of up to 0.5 Orbit# is optional for non-companion stars
but is recommended to allow greater system variation.

_To begin fleshing out the Zed quintuple system, the 1D_
and 2D-7 rolls for the companion star’s (Ab) Orbit# are 1
and -1, which results in an Orbit# of 0.09. The roll for the
Near star (B) is 1 for a result of 1 + 5 or Orbit# 6, and for
the Far star (Ca), another 1 for 1 + 11 = Orbit# 12. The
rolls for the Far star’s companion (Cb) are 2 and 1 or
Orbit# 0.21 from the Far star. Adding single digit fractional
variance values to each of the other stars results in: 6.1
and 12.2. The equivalent AU values for all four stars are
Ab: 0.036, B: 5.68, Ca: 338.7, and Cb: 0.084 (from Ca).

Minimum separation = AU × (1 – Eccentricity)
Maximum separation = AU × (1 + Eccentricity)

**_Orbit# (with fractional value)_** = Full Orbit# +

AU - Distance(AU) of Full Orbit#
Difference(AU) of Full Orbit#



In some cases, adding these factors will cause stellar
orbits to cross. If this occurs, the Referee can assume
that inclinations, orientations, or timing prevent stellar
collisions, or add one full Orbit# to the outer crossing
star’s Orbit# and recompute until the issue resolves.

For the Zed system, rolling for eccentricity and adding
fractional values results in 0.11 for the companion, 0.08
for the Near star, a large 0.47 for the Far star and 0.27
for its companion. A table can help keep track of the
orbits of multiple stars of varying distances. The stars are
parenthetically named using standard multi-star protocols.

TRUE ORBITAL CHARACTERISTICS


In this book, orbits are simplified. Real orbits have
six properties, which can be expressed as semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination, longitude of the
ascending node, argument of periapsis and true
anomaly. For simplification, only two of these are
considered: the eccentricity and semi-major axis (AU) properties. This produces a simplified two-dimensional view of a star system and does not
consider position of objects in their orbits.

For the purposes of determining plausible orbits
and temperature variations over time, the two
orbital properties of eccentricity and semi-major
axis (whether in Orbit#s, AU, kilometres or
planetary diameters) provide sufficient information
but for the purist, the other four orbital properties
could be calculated and recorded.

Inclination
This is the value in degrees of an orbit’s inclination
to the plane of the star system – usually defined
by the equator of the central star but sometimes by
an average inclination of the system’s worlds. In

a system with multiple stars there may be multiple
definitions of this plane, or they may all use a
single value based on the primary star. Inclinations
range in value from 0 to 180 degrees. To determine
an object’s inclination:

2D Inclination severity Degrees
2–6 Very Low 1D ÷ 2
7 Low 1D
8 Moderate 2D
9 High (2D × 3) + 1D
10 Very High (1D + 1) × 5 + 1D
11 Extreme (3D x 5) - 1D
12 Retrograde roll again and subtract
the result from 180
Anomalous planetary orbits can determine
inclination as indicated on page 50.

Longitude of Ascending Node: This is the point at
which an inclined orbit crosses its plane of reference
in an upward direction. It is essentially a random
value expressed in degrees from a defined reference
point. Any method of creating a linear random value
between 0 and 1 and multiplying by 360 will work
for creating this value. It is most often expressed as
a range of -180 to +180 degrees and requires the
establishment of the system’s reference point.

Argument of Periapsis: This is the angle from
the ascending node to the point in the orbit where
the object is closest to its primary (where distance
= semi-major axis × (1 – eccentricity)). It is also
a linear random value between 0 and 360, which
may be expressed as -180 to +180. Alternatively,
the longitude of periapsis is sometime used,
determining this point from the same reference
point as used for the ascending node.

True Anomaly: This is the position of the body
in its orbit at a certain time (or epoch). It is
measured from the point of periapsis. It is also
measured in degrees, usually from 0–360 but it is
not strictly linearly determined, as the degree of
eccentricity influences the speed of an object at
various points in its orbit. A linear approximation
can be used, especially for not very eccentric
orbits or, instead the Referee can record the
object’s position as a fraction of its ‘year’ elapsed
since periapsis at the time of the epoch.

**STELLAR CLASSES AND**

**TYPES FOR MULTI-STAR SYSTEMS**
The key premise of generating multi-star systems is
that the primary star is the most massive and likely
the most luminous star in the system. Likewise, the
companion of any Close, Near or Far star is assumed
to be less massive than its parent. To determine the
Type and Class of other stars in the system, consult
the Non-Primary Star Determination table. Use the
secondary column for all Close, Near and Far stars.
Use the companion column for all companions but
treat its direct secondary parent as the ‘primary’ for
typing purposes. White dwarfs, pulsars, neutron
stars and black holes use the post-stellar column.
Brown dwarfs and protostar primary stars may only
have additional ‘stars’ of the same type; all brown
dwarfs use the sibling result and protostars use the
secondary or companion columns to determine the
nature of the non-primary protostars.

Class III or IV primary stars DM-1 for all columns

The table’s results indicate next steps in star type
determination:

Random: Roll on the regular Star Type
Determination table on page 15. If the new star result
is a hotter type/subtype than the primary, treat the
result as lesser instead.

Lesser: Treat the new star as the same class and one
type cooler than the primary or parent , e.g., F becomes
G, K becomes M, and reroll the new subtype. The

lesser of a M-type star is another M-type star, but if this
second star has a higher subtype than its parent, it is a
brown dwarf instead. For post-stellar objects, a lesser
result for a black hole becomes a neutron star, a lesser
neutron star or pulsar becomes a white dwarf, and a
lesser white dwarf becomes a brown dwarf. If a Class
IV star has a lesser which is too cool to be a Class IV,
convert the lesser to a Class V lesser type star instead.

Sibling: The new star is slightly smaller than the
parent. Subtract 1D from the subtype. If this becomes
a negative number, use a cooler type and subtract 10,
e.g., a sibling result for a G8 V with a roll of 3 becomes
a K1 V, not a G 11 V. Post-stellar sibling objects remain
in the same class, but less massive by 1D × 10% of
the mass of the parent, but do not reduce size past
minimums for that type of object.

Twin: The new star is essentially the same size and
type as its parent. Use the same class, type and
subtype. Optional subtract 1D-1% from the mass and
diameter of the new star to allow for some variation.

Other: Roll again on the other column.

SYSTEM AGE ADJUSTMENT


If a new star is a post stellar object but the primary
is a fusing star, the age of the entire stellar system
could be reset. Use the final age (see page 22) of
the post-stellar object, remembering to multiply its
post-stellar mass by an appropriate amount, and
add the elapsed age of the object’s post stellar life to
determine system age.

If this new age exceeds the main sequence lifespan
of a main sequence primary star, the Referee can
arbitrarily increase the mass of the post-stellar object
to the point where its elapsed age would be less
than the main sequence lifespan of the primary star.
Using this reverse engineering method, rare starting
combinations, such as a blue supergiant and a
white dwarf, will result in the mass of the post-stellar
object becoming large enough to change its class,
forcing it to be a neutron star or black hole. This is an
acceptable result.

For the continuation method, if the results of system
age determination are too young to account for known
details, such as the existence of complex or native
sophont life, the system age can be adjusted upward
but only within the natural lifespans of the system’s
stars. Accounting for anomalies – such as native
sophonts around Deneb – will require the Referee
to create an alternative explanation. In Charted
Space, the fallback explanation is that the Ancients

stars



have something to do with it; more generically such
interference in the natural order of things can be
attributed to ‘Alien Space Bats’.

Rolling for Zed’s other four stars, first, the companion
is 8: sibling; a further 1D roll of 1 makes its subtype just
one dimmer than the primary, so Zed Ab is a G8 V star.

For the near star, rolling on the secondary column
and getting an 8 means the near star is lesser, so it
is a K-type star and rolling for subtype (using the Star
Subtype table on page 16) makes it a K8 V.

The Far star is also considered a secondary and the
roll of 6 indicates random, so going back to the Star
Type Determination table, a roll of 6 indicates an
M-type and rolling on the M column of the Star Subtype
chart results in a 0, so the Far star is an M0 V.

The Far star’s companion treats the Far star (M0 V) as
its primary and rolls on the companion column but rolls
a 2, indicating other. Rolling again on the other column
results in a 7, which is a white dwarf, or D.

These four additional stars require their own
determination of mass, diameter and luminosity but
rather than work through the same type of examples
again, the results for the first three are just indicated
in the IIS Class 0 Survey Form (0421B-0) at the end
of this chapter. Note that the Referee might optionally
choose to carry forward a variance result for the first
star and apply it to the others to account for similar
evolutionary conditions and compositions for all the
stars but as with variance determination itself, this is
an optional and potentially tedious procedure from a
record-keeping standpoint. However, it was done for
this example system.

The fourth new star, the white dwarf companion to the
Far star requires more work as it might affect the age
of the entire system. It also requires referencing the
Special Circumstances chapter’s White Dwarfs section
on page 227 to determine its mass. A roll for mass
using 2D-1 ÷ 10 + d10 ÷ 100 results in 0.49.

To determine the age of this white dwarf, multiply
its mass by 2+D3 – a 3 – is 1.47 and plug it into the
formula: Star Final Age = 10 ÷ Mass2.5 × (1 + 1 ÷ (4 +
Mass) + 1 ÷ (10 × Mass^3 )) to get 4.635 billion years. As
this is considerably less than the previously generated
Zed system age of 6.336, nothing needs to be done
to adjust the system’s age and the white dwarf’s age

- meaning how long it has been a white dwarf – is the

difference between the system’s age and its final age,
or 6.336 - 4.635 equals 1.701 billion years old. Looking
at the White Dwarf aging table on page 227, this
places it between the 1.5 and 2.5 billion year columns
and a linear estimation of the temperature difference (-.201 x 1,500 +7,000) is 6,699 K or 6,700 K, which,
when plugged into the luminosity equation assuming a
diameter of 0.017 equals 0.000525.

STAR ORBIT PERIOD


The time period (in standard years) required for two
large masses to orbit each other is equal to the square
root of the value of their separation (in AU) cubed,
divided by their combined (solar) masses or:

With the mass of one star being M and the other
m. When considering multiple stars orbiting each
other, this equation holds for two bodies but when,
for example, Zed’s third star orbits the primary and
its companion, the mass of both the primary and
companion is considered as M and the third star is m.
For short periods, it may be more meaningful to convert
years (y) to standard days (d) by multiplying the result
by 365.25, or even to hours (h) by multiplying by 8,766.

With the masses of all the stars in the Zed system
known, we can compute their various orbital periods.
The mass of each star in the table below is the
equivalent of m in the formula. The value of M is the
sum of the stars indicated in the orbits around column:

STAR SYSTEM PROFILE


The IISS shorthand profile for a star system has two
formats, one for a single star and one for a multi-star
system. The single star format is:

`#-T# C-M-D-L-A`

Where:
# = # of stars (1 in this case and often omitted),
T# = Type and subtype,
C = Class,
M = Mass,
D = Diameter,
L = Luminosity,
A = System Age in Gyr.

If Zed’s system has been a single star system, its
profile would be 1-G7 V-0.929-0.967-0.738-6.336.

The multi-star variant appends additional stars after the
primary star:

`#-T# C-M-D-L-A:D-O-E-T# C-M-D-L:D-O-E-T# C-M-D-L...`

Where each star beyond the primary is indicated by:
D = Designation (e.g., B or Ab),
O = Orbit in Orbit#,
E = Eccentricity,
and the rest follows the same pattern as the primary.

A simpler profile strictly lists the T# C parameters of the
star(s) separated by a colon.

_The profile for the entire Zed system is the long string:_
5-G7 V-0.929-0.967-0.738-6.336:Ab-0.09-0.11-G8
V-0.907-0.957-0.681:B-6.1-0.08-K8 V-0.626-0.777-0.136:Ca-12.1-0.47-M0 V-0.510-0.728-0.0895:Cb-0.21-0.24-D-0.490-0.017-0.000525
Or, in simpler format just: G7 V:G8 V:K7 V:M0 V:D.

IISS PROCEDURAL


The Imperial Interstellar Scout Service is responsible
for maintaining star charts and information on stellar
systems for all of Charted Space and many places
beyond. Much of this work requires travel to these
star systems and detailed surveys by personnel and
machines in the system itself. Details on stellar-class
objects, however, are data the IISS can gather remotely.

The survey branch, or Imperial Grand Survey,
is responsible for creating and maintaining this
information. In most cases, stellar-level data is evident

from potentially hundreds of parsecs distance. Long
observation from multiple locations within the Third
Imperium have determined the coordinates of most
stars within 3,000 parsecs of the Imperial borders and
of many stars across the entire span of the galaxy
and its surrounding satellite galaxies. The presence
of non-stellar objects is much less complete. Brown
dwarfs are likely more plentiful than stars but as they
age they emit less heat, becoming indistinguishable
from large gas giants except in terms of gravitational
influence. Most white dwarfs, young pulsars and
neutron stars are visible, sometimes across even
vaster distances, as are black holes that are feeding
off accretion disks. However, a quiescent black hole
or aging neutron star, while more massive than most
stars, is only visible if it has a direct gravitational effect
on another body or passes in front of a luminous
source, creating a temporary gravitational lens effect.
The former method of identification is accurate over
vast differences, the latter, while visible at perhaps
even further distances, provides only a single data
point and at best a provisional one-time marking on an
external mapping branch chart.

The Scout Service categorises surveys in five Classes,
from Class I to Class V. Remote observation from
established scout bases and reference to thousands

stars



of years of charts provides something else, a Class 0
survey by professional astronomers within the survey
branch who never travel aboard starships except
as passengers when transferring between posts or
attending conferences on other worlds. Class 0 data
gathered by remote observation from distances beyond
30 parsecs corresponds to a Survey Index (SI) of 3.

CLASS 0 SURVEY
Class 0 Surveys, also called ‘armchair surveys’ are
conducted at great distance, using arrays of telescopes
and referencing historical star charts, some nearly
10,000 years old. At the world of Reference (Core 0140)
the IISS maintains a ‘golden copy’ of verified stellar
records for 80% of the stars in the galaxy and 60% of
the stars in 80% of the globular clusters and satellite
galaxies surrounding it. More than 10% of the stars in
the Andromeda galaxy and other members of the Local
Group are compiled in these records. Updates can take
years to arrive, and errors can take centuries to correct,
but records exist for nearly every star system in Charted
Space and within 3,000 parsecs of Reference. This
database is available to all active duty and recalled scout
personnel, although some information is redacted for
unspecified reasons. This database is referred to as the
Reference Star Chart or RSC.

A general public version of this database is freely
available from every scout base and contains
information for all Charted Space sectors within
four sectors or 160 parsecs of Reference and many
regions up to 200 parsecs distant. This database
has a considerably greater number of redactions,
often excluding even basic information on Red Zone
systems. This public version is called the Reference
Public Star Chart or RPSC. The RPSC has an official
date stamp of 360-1068, after the date of a complete
data validating and reformatting effort following the
Second Survey. Updates are published annually but
these provide only incremental data on a small fraction
of surveyed systems.

The RSC includes many distant systems never visited
by the IISS or its predecessors but some of these
systems still have partial information related to some
planetary-sized bodies. These include some gas
giants and many smaller bodies discovered by remote
techniques. As this information is sparse, spotty and
unverified, it is not generally included as part of the
Class 0 Survey information. The end result of a Class 0
survey data review is an increase of the SI of a system
to 4. Some records in the RSC include only SI 1, 2, or 3
data for distant unvisited stars.

The format for Class 0 and Class I surveys, complete
or incomplete, is identical and has not changed since
the end of the First Survey.

For very distant systems, especially when precise
stellar orbits are unknown, records are often kept in a
tabular Class 0 survey form covering an entire sector
or subsector. These forms are not widely distributed
but are usually not restricted and may be available to
reputable inquirers on request. These forms contain
a single line for each system allowing for up to eight
stars with fields for general location of primary,
secondary and companions, usually filled in with
stellar Type, Subtype and Class and any detected gas
giants or other remarks.

CLASS I SURVEY


Determining the orbital characteristics of stars and
planetary objects requires a closer survey. A Class I
survey can be conducted by a massive observatory-equipped scout survey cruiser from within 30 parsecs
or by a smaller Armstrong- or Donosev-class survey
vessel from one or two parsecs distant. These surveys
will detect any substellar objects down to the mass of
large gas giants and require only 2D hours to conduct
with the Science skill specialities of astronomy, physics
and/or planetology. The end result of a Class I survey
scan is an increase of the SI of a system to 5, which
confirms some partial information about a system’s
large to medium gas giants and probable orbital planes.

Only systems with complete and verified Class I survey
data are included in the RPSC. All records in the RPSC
have at least a completed Class 0/I survey form. This is
a SI 4 record allowing for an arbitrary number of stellar-like objects with a comments field for each which may
include additional information.

EXAMPLES


These examples use a partially complete filled-out
Class 0/I survey record from the RSC database
emulating the data available in a full Class 0 survey.
Certain information, such as gas giant details and
HZCO – the Habitable Zone Centre Orbit are blank, to
parallel information established in this chapter and the
system age lacks specificity. The completed Class I
Survey version of this form – what would be available
to the RPSC database – is visible in the Class II/III
survey form as shown at the end of the Systems and
World chapter examples starting on page 61. This is
possible because the Class II/III form’s upper portion is
identical to a Class 0/I survey form.

than repeat the steps provided in text, this section
includes the completed Class 0/I Survey Form. Note

the separate entries for composite components (Aab,
AB, Cab and ABC). This allows the computation of
orbits and temperatures of planets that circle more than
one star. By convention, the primary star (Aa) is defined
as being at Orbit# 0, although in fact Aa and Ab orbit
each other around a common barycentre.

CORELLA


The Corella system is home to Corella, the capital
world of the Corellan League. It has a designated
mainworld and stellar statistics from Travellermap.com
indicating two stars: a G2 V and a G8 V. Text from the
Spinward Extents (page 113) indicates that Corella is
‘orbiting two suns’, so rather than using the Existing
Star Locations (Binaries) table in the Existing Systems (Continuation) section, the Referee can specify that the
G8 V is a companion star and determine characteristics
of the orbit on that basis.

Values for the stars’ mass, diameter and other
parameters were determined with variances and by
formulas for both stars. System age was computed
from the larger of the two stars as a range of up to
8.9 billion years (Gyrs). Using two d10 for a d100
percentage of lifespan, resulted in a 56, which can be
multiplied as a percent against the 8.9 to become 4.984
Gyrs. As the world has already been determined to host
native life, results of less than two billion years would
have been rerolled or adjusted by the Referee.

Besides stars and stellar-like objects detailed in the
previous chapter, a star system is occupied by planets,
moons and asteroids, as well as comets, dust and
other detritus not generally considered by Traveller
system generation rules. The Traveller Core Rulebook
concerns itself with just two properties of a system:
the mainworld and the presence of one or more gas
giants. The World Builder’s Handbook concerns itself
with all of the significant bodies in a system. In addition
to the mainworld, these objects include any and all
gas giants, substantial planetoid or asteroid belts, and
all other significant worlds present in a system. This
chapter deals with the initial enumeration, placement
and sizing of these bodies.

WORLD TYPES AND QUANTITIES


All systems have a designated mainworld. For a pre-existing system, this world is already detailed using the
basic system generation procedures in the Traveller
Core Rulebook or is available from some other pre-existing source. If generating a new ‘clean’ system
strictly by the expanded method, this mainworld is not
yet designated but will be determined by the Referee
as system generation proceeds.

PRE-EXISTING MAINWORLDS (CONTINUATION METHOD ONLY)
Any existing system created using the Traveller Core
Rulebook or defined by many Traveller supplements
and/or the Travellermap.com web site will have a pre-existing mainworld. In many cases, this will just be the
basic UWP data from the mainworld and an indication
of whether a gas giant is present within the system. In
other cases, it may include additional information on
stars, other worlds and planetoid belts. This data may
have been generated by different methods, including
those in Book 6 Scouts, the DGP’s World Builder’s
Handbook or T5.

When scouts survey a new system, a mainworld is not
automatically generated. If native sophonts or some
other local population exists, the world with the most
people on it will generally become the mainworld.
In the many systems without local or transplanted
sophonts, the mainworld becomes whichever world
the Referee designates.

# S WORLDS AND ORBITS

## YSTEM

For pre-existing mainworlds, most of the procedures
that follow still apply. This chapter will add further
details to both world and star system but the process is
designed to accommodate whatever information exists,
not to supplant it. In cases where certain data about
the world and system already exists, it can be inserted
in the procedure with little modification. For instance, if
a system is known to have three gas giants, this fact is
substituted for the random determination of the presence
and number of gas giants. Also, the count of planetoid
belts and terrestrial planets may be altered if an existing
mainworld affects the ‘raw’ count of such objects.

KNOWN WORLDS IN EXISTING SYSTEMS (CONTINUATION METHOD ONLY)
In addition to the presence of the mainworld and
possibly a gas giant, many systems have additional
information published about them. Much of this
information comes from any PBG (Population, Belts,
Giants) data previously published and the W or world
number for the system, which includes the mainworld,
planetoid belts, gas giants and additional planets.
Additional planets are displayed as ‘other worlds’ on
Travellermap.com but can also be computed from
some Traveller data files by subtracting first one (for the
mainworld), the planetoid belt number (B) and then gas
giant number (G) from the W code. If these values are
known, the process of creating a system can move to
on to the Available Orbits section on page 38.

GAS GIANTS


A gas giant is defined as any world with a thick
atmosphere primarily consisting of hydrogen, generally
of at least twice Terra’s diameter and ranging in mass
from 10⊕ up to the lower limit of brown dwarfs at
13 Jupiter masses (MJ) or about 4,000 mass⊕. As
determined by the Traveller Core Rulebook on page
246, gas giants are absent in a system on a 2D roll
of 10+; this is the equivalent of gas giants not being
present in one system out of six. An alternative method
to determine if a gas giant exists is roll 1D and indicate
existence on a 2+. The Referee can pick the method
that works best for them and stick with it:

There are no DMs to the gas giant existence roll
unless the primary star is subject to rules covered
in the Special Circumstances chapter. If a gas giant
is present, roll on the Gas Giant Quantity table to
determine the number of gas giants present.

**PLANETOID BELTS**
All systems have a few random rocks in orbit around
their stars but many have substantial zones of small
bodies, usually the result of failed planetary formation
or of some catastrophic collision in the system’s
past. If a mainworld is Size 0, this normally means
that a planetoid belt exists and the mainworld is
defined as one or more of its members. This is not
necessarily the case; the mainworld could potentially
be a lone rock, a planetary ring, or even an artificial
station. The number of planetary belts recorded for
an existing system does not consider the home belt
of a Size 0 mainworld (if any) as a planetoid belt.
The distinction of asteroid belt, for the mainworld and
planetoid belt for other defined regions of many small
bodies, is arbitrary but this distinction allows for Size 0
mainworlds of varying types.

Regardless of the nature of the mainworld, a planetoid
belt is present on a roll of 8+.

There are no DMs to the planetoid belt existence roll
unless the primary star is subject to rules covered in
the Special Circumstances chapter. If a planetoid belt
is present, roll on the Planetoid Belt Quantity table to
determine the number.

Continuation Method Only: If a mainworld already
exists and is known to be an asteroid belt (not some
other Size 0 body like an artificial station, moonlet, or
ring) the Referee should add one planetoid belt to the
total or add one if none exists. This is important for
allocating worlds, especially in multi-star systems but this
extra belt must be subtracted when importing planetoid
belt data (but not total world data) into Travellermap.

TERRESTRIAL PLANETS


Besides the mainworld and any gas giants or planetoid
belts, a system may have additional planets. These
worlds can range in Size from 1 toF (15). They are
termed terrestrial planets, because like Terra they are

mostly solid bodies in orbit around their sun. Some, but
not most, of these worlds may be habitable planets.
These worlds could also include bodies orbiting within
planetoid belts (think of the ‘dwarf planets’ of Ceres,
Pluto and Eris).

All systems will have a quantity of terrestrial planets:

Reroll as D3+2

If the resultant terrestrial
planets are 3 or more

Add D3-1

Continuation Method: If a mainworld already exists
and is not an asteroid belt or moon of a gas giant, the
Referee should consider this world to be one of the
resultant terrestrial planets.

TOTAL WORLDS


A system’s value of total worlds is simply the sum of
planetoid belts, gas giants and terrestrial planets, with
any mainworld that is not a moon counted as one of
the terrestrial planets. If it is Size 0, then it is counted
as one of the planetoid belts, unless it is determined to
be something else: a ring, artificial body or lone small
system object. However, in general:

Total Worlds = Planetoid Belts + Gas Giants +
Terrestrial Planets

Continuing with the example, Zed’s mainworld is not
defined, so this system will be entirely created using
the expanded method. Rolling 2D for gas giants, a 7
indicates that they exist and a further roll on the Gas
Giant Quantity table with DM-1 for the post-stellar
object (the white dwarf) and DM-1 for four or more stars
results in 11-2 = 9, which is four gas giants.

Rolling for planetoid belts, a 9 indicates they are
present and a Planetoid Belt Quantity table roll of 7 with
DMs for gas giants, the white dwarf, and having two or
more stars results in a 10, or two planetoid belts.

A 2D-2 roll for terrestrial planets is 12-2 -1(for the post-stellar object) = 9, and the Referee adds a DM+D3-1
resulting in 2, totalling 11 terrestrial planets. The Zed
system has 4+2+11 = 17 worlds.

AVAILABLE ORBITS


The location of additional stars and worlds within a
system is expressed in Orbit#s as described earlier, on
page 24. Planets can only occupy certain orbits around
one or more star depending on the configuration of the
stars and their size.

SINGLE STAR SYSTEMS


For a single star system, determining available orbits
is a straightforward process, with the only restrictions
being based on the diameter of very large giant stars,
which may expand far beyond Orbit# 0 to Orbit# 6 or
more in extreme cases, and on the tidal effects of the
star which may shred objects orbiting too closely. This
tidal effect, the Roche limit, depends on a number of
factors but for simplicity, this process assumes the
limit is about 0.01 AU (or 1.5 million kilometres) times
the listed stellar diameter. Converting this distance to
Orbit#s and assuming a minimum fractional Orbit# of
0.01 provides the results of the Minimum Allowable
Orbit# table next page.

MULTI-STAR SYSTEM ALLOWABLE ORBITS
Star systems with multiple stars add complexity to
which Orbit#s are available. The actual mechanics
of such calculations, especially in trinary or more
complex systems with varying eccentricities,
involves a considerable amount of math followed
by approximation assumptions about multi-body
gravitational interactions over time. This physics-based
approach, called the n-body problem, does not actually
have a general solution. Instead of attempting to
solve this problem or develop numerous approximate
formulas for special cases a set of simplifying
assumptions can approximate feasibly stable planetary
orbits in multi-star systems. For this procedure,
available Orbit# ranges around the primary star and
any other stars in the system follow these rules:

1. Each star Minimum Allowable Orbit# or MAO is
    indicated on the Minimal Allowable Orbit# table.
2. If a star has a companion, all available Orbit#s
    around a star and its companion are considered
    circumbinary – they orbit both stars, and any Orbit#
    less than 0.50 plus the companion’ eccentricity are
    not available. For stars with an MAO of greater
    than 0.2 add the MAO of the larger star to the
    range of unavailable orbits. Optionally, if the star
    and/or its companion are dimmer than M5 V or M5
    VI stars or are brown dwarfs and if the habitable
    zone centre (determined in the following section)
    lies within Orbit# 0.13, then the maximum allowable
    Orbit# for that star, individually, is one-quarter the
    minimum distance between these stars, i.e., 0.25 ×
    (1 – eccentricity) × Companion Orbit#.

system worlds and orbits

**_Terrestrial Planets =_** 2D-2 +DMs

3. The primary star (and its possible companion) can
    have Orbit# up to 20 available.
4. For each star in Close, Near or Far orbits, note the
    Orbit# of the star and consider any companions
    to occupy the same Orbit# as their parent. For
    optional orbits between them, these star pairs
    follow the same rule as the primary and any
    companion as above. For the following steps
    companions are ignored.
5. For the Close, Near or Far Orbit occupied by a
    secondary star, consider the Orbits# +1.00 from
    that secondary star to be the nearest available
    to the primary star, e.g., if a Near star occupied
    Orbit# 6.10, then the range of Orbit#s from 5.10
    and below and from 7.10 and above would be
    available to the primary star but from 5.11 to 7.09
    would be unavailable. If a secondary star has an
    MAO of greater 0.2, add its MAO to the exclusion
    zone around the primary star.
6. If the eccentricity of any Close, Near or Far secondary
    star is greater than 0.2, add one more Orbit# on either
    side of the star’s Orbit# to the primary’s unavailability
    zone, e.g., in the same example, if the Near star’s
    eccentricity was more than 0.2, then the range of
    Orbit#s greater than 4.10 and less than 8.10 would be
    unavailable to the primary star.
7. If any Close or Near secondary star has an
    eccentricity of greater than 0.5, add another
    Orbit# on either side of the primary star’s orbit to
    the unavailability zone, e.g., if the Near star had

an eccentricity of more than 0.5, the primary star
could not use Orbit#s between 3.10 and 9.10.
Note that this additional condition does not apply
to Far secondary stars.

8. Close, Near or Far secondary stars have their own
    centred orbits. These can extend up to an Orbit#
    equal to their Orbit# minus 3, e.g., the Near star in
    Orbit# 6.10 is allowed its own Orbit#s, centred on
    itself, up to Orbit# 3.10.
9. Reduce the allowed Orbit#s for each Close, Near
    or Far secondary star by one Orbit# if the system
    has stars in the adjacent zone, e.g., stars in Close
    and Near, or in Near and Far, but not stars in
    Close and Far only, so if the Near secondary star
    mentioned above was in a system that also had a
    Far star, it would only be able to use Orbit#s up to
    2.10 from its centre. Note that the primary star does
    not trigger this condition for any stars and that the
    condition only triggers once, even if a Near star had
    both Close and Far neighbours.
10. Reduce the allowed Orbit#s for each Close, Near
    or Far secondary star by one Orbit# if they or any
    adjacent zone star has an eccentricity greater than
    0.2, e.g., for the Near star if either it or the Far star
    (or both) had an eccentricity of more than 0.2, then
    the available orbits would be reduced to 1.10 for
    the Near star and the Far star would also have its
    available Orbit#s reduced by 1.00. As above, this
    condition can only be triggered once per star.

system worlds and orbits



11. If any Close, Near or Far star has an eccentricity
    of greater than 0.5, reduce the available Orbit#s of
    that star by another Orbit#, e.g., if the Near star’s
    eccentricity was greater than 0.5, then its available
    Orbit#s would be reduced again to 0.10. Again, this
    condition can only be triggered once per star.

Consider the following for the example Zed star system:

Star Orbit# Ecc MAO
Primary (Aa) 0 — —
Companion (Ab) 0.09 0.11 —
Near (B) 6.10 0.08 0.02
Far (Ca) 12.01 0.47 —
Far Companion (Cb) 0.21 0.24 —

In this example, the Minimum Allowable Orbit# (MAO)
was determined by the table (and ignored for now for
the white dwarf) and neither of the companions nor
their direct primaries are allowed to have direct Orbit#s.
The orbital configurations to consider are that of the
primary and companion (here referred to as plain A),
the Near star (B) and the Far star and companion (C).

For A, the companion’s orbit with eccentricity 0.11
prevents Orbit#s less than 0.50 + 0.11 or 0.61 from
being available. The presence of B at Orbit 6.10 blocks
one full Orbit# on either side (but no more, as its
eccentricity is below 0.2), so Orbit#s within 5.10 to 7.10
are excluded. The presence of Cab at Orbit# 12.10
with eccentricity 0.47 blocks two full Orbit#s on either
side, leaving those within 10.10 to 14.10 unavailable.
Orbits 14.10 and above out to 20 are still available.
The ‘middle range’ allowed between 7.10 and 10.10
would cause any existing planets to be circumtrinary,
or orbiting three stars Aa, Ab and B. Orbits at or above
14.10 would orbit all five stars. The final allowable
range is an interrupted pattern of 0.61 – 5.10, 7.10

- 10.10, and 14.10 – 20.00. The actual ‘amount’ of
Orbit#s is the sum of these numbers, 13.39 , which will
become important later.

For star B, it would normally have Orbit#s 0.02 to 3.10 (6.10 - 3) available but the ‘adjacent’ Far star, reduces
the outer bound to 2.10 and the Far star’s eccentricity
of 0.47 reduce it again to Orbit 1.10, so B’s final
available range is 0.02 to 1.10 or a total of 1.08 Orbit#s.

The pair of stars at C cannot have Orbit#s less than
0.5 + 0.24 or 0.74 available. The pair start with Orbit#s
out to 9.10 (12.10 - 3) available but this is modified by
the presence of star B and by the eccentricity of their

ALTERNATE MULTI-STAR
ORBIT DETERMINATION


The method above requires only minimal math
to determine available Orbit#s in a multi-star
system. A more realistic physics-based approach
requires converting distances from Orbit# to AUs
and back again, with calculations in between.
A table to track the results will be handy. This
method determines the region of gravitational
influence for each star – known as the Hill
sphere – and the edge of the stable region within
that region where planets are likely to form and
remain in place. For this process:

Step 1: Convert all Orbit# to AU. For this iteration,
assume that companions and their ‘parent’ star
have no Orbit#s but this process can also be used
to determine stable orbits around each of these
stars as well.

Step 2: Determine the Hill sphere for each star,
starting with the primary star and working outward.
The formula is:

**_Hill Sphere_** _= AUx (1 - ecc) x_

Step 2a: For the primary star, AU = AU distance of
closest secondary star and for each of these stars
that has a companion, subtract the companion’s
orbit in AU × (1 + companion’s eccentricity) from
this AU value. In the Hill sphere equation ecc =
eccentricity of that secondary star’s orbit, m =
mass of the primary star + mass of its companion
if it has one, and M = mass of the secondary star
+ its companion if it has one.

Step 2b: For each secondary star, AU distance
from the primary for that star and for each of
these stars that has a companion, subtract
the companion orbit in AU × (1 + companion’s
eccentricity) from the AU value, ecc = eccentricity
of that secondary star’s orbit, m = mass of
secondary star + mass of its companion if it
has one, and M = mass of the primary star + its
companion if it has one.

m
3 x M

3

Step 2c: If more than one secondary star exists,
also check each against the other(s). For the AU
value, subtract AU × (1 + ecc) of the inner star
from AU × (1 - ecc) of the outer star, plus any
adjustments as above for companion orbits in a
manner that shrinks the distance (subtract ecc
from outer, add ecc for inner).

Step 2d: For stars which have multiple Hill
sphere results from intra-star calculations, record
the smallest Hill sphere result as the star’s
effective Hill sphere.

Step 3: Divide each Hill sphere result by 3. This
is the AU distance of the outer stable orbit, the
‘stability sphere’ of the star – allow any variance
of orbits to exceed this value but do not allow any
orbits larger than half the Hill sphere.

Step 4: Convert the AU value of the stability
sphere to Orbit#. Use this value for Orbit# limits
around each star – or star and companion,
including the primary.

Step 5: To determine stable orbits around multiple
stars (including the companion) multiply the
outermost star’s Hill sphere AU value by2 (if an
orbit was around A and B, this would be B’s Hill
sphere) and add this value to the outermost star’s
AU × (1 + ecc). Convert to Orbit#s. This is the
start of the stable zone for this set of stars.

Step 6: If additional outer stars exist beyond the
distance determined in step 5, the end of the
stable zone is equal to this limiting star’s AU × (1 -
ecc) minus the inner star’s AU × (1 + ecc), minus
this outer star’s Hill sphere. Convert to Orbit#s.
Repeat steps 5 and 6 as necessary.

Step 7: For all stars, the range of Available
Orbit#s still begins with the MAO of the star or of
the star and companion, although 3 × Orbit# × (1+
ecc) can be used to substitute for the standard
MAO of a star and companion, if desired.

orbit around the primary by a total of -2.00 leaving only
Orbit#s 0.74 - 7.10 available. While this outer bound
seems high, Orbit# 7.10 is only 11 AU and the pair
never come even as close as 179 AU to any inner star.
The total range for the C pair is equal to 6.36 Orbit#s.

DETERMINING HABITABLE ZONE



CENTRE ORBIT# (HZCO)
An important factor to consider when placing planets
is the location of the habitable zone around a system’s
stars. Many factors can determine whether a world’s
surface temperature is actually amicable to life but from
an Orbit# standpoint, it is possible to determine a base
ideal habitable zone orbit. This is the location where
a planet similar to Terra will have conditions similar
to Terra, namely an average surface temperature of
about 15°C or 288K. Working backwards, by definition
this corresponds to an orbit of 1 AU around a star with
1  luminosity. The relationship between temperature,
distance and luminosity is:

or HZCO – is equal to the square root of the star’s
luminosity. Plugging this into the Star Luminosity by
Class table gives the following values in AU in the
table above.

This table only applies to single stars. For circumbinary
worlds of a star with a companion, the total luminosity of
the two components can be added together to determine
the effective location of the HZCO. Multiple stars in other

orbits, especially if those orbits are outside the location
of the world in question, become more complex but such
effects will be considered in detail later. As a first pass
for determining the habitable zone centre, all stars with a
lower Orbit# number than the planet, i.e., all of the stars
the planet effectively orbits, are simply added together
to arrive at a combined luminosity value to use in the
distance equation.

Converting the above AU values into Orbit#s results in
the following:

system worlds and orbits

For the Zed system, determining the habitable zone
of a star and its companion involves adding their
luminosity together. The combined luminosity of
the Aab pair is 1.419 – treat it as 1.4 for simplicity,
because then the centre of the habitable zone should
correspond that of a G0 V star, namely Orbit# 3.3. A
calculated approach would lead to 1.191 AU which
converts to Orbit# 3.3166, rounded to 3.3, validating
the ‘close enough’ approach in this case.

For the K8 V Star B, the centre of the habitable zone
can be determined as interpolation from the above
table as 2/5 between 0.72(M0) and 1.2(K5) equalling
Orbit# 0.91, or it can be determined by formula and
AU to Orbit conversion: it has a luminosity of 0.136,
so the distance should be the square root of 0.136
AUs or 0.369 AU, which is Orbit# 0.9225 or 0.92 –
_not much of a difference for the extra work but as it is_
supposed to be brighter the Zed example will use the
_more difficult calculation. In theory, the HZCO for the_
triple stars of Aa, Ab and B could be calculated using
their combined luminosity of 1.555, but this results in
a HZCO value of 1.25AU, or about Orbit# 3.4, which
is essentially the same as that for the A pair alone
and also not particularly valid, as star B is further
than this orbit location.

For the M0 V Star Ca and its dim white dwarf
companion, with a total luminosity of 0.0896, which is
also brighter than standard; a calculated habitable zone
centre is 0.299 AU or Orbit# 0.75.

**HABITABLE ZONE BREADTH**
The entire habitable breadth zone of a star (or
combination of stars) stretches across two full
Orbit#s or +1.0 Orbit#s from the HZCO. This means
that a world’s deviation from the HZCO can be
computed as simply:

**_HZCO Deviation =_** Orbit# - HZCO

A negative number implies the orbit is closer to the
sun and therefore hotter, and a positive number is
further and therefore colder. This provides a value
for all calculations of habitable zone and basic
temperature above Orbit#1.

If either the HZCO or the Orbit# of the world lies
below Orbit#1, the calculation becomes more
complicated. The same basic subtraction occurs but
the result is modified by dividing by the smaller of the
HZCO or the worlds’ Orbit number and will result in a
greater effective deviation.

This calculation is not perfect but provides a good
estimation of deviation from the HZCO to use in the
Basic Temperature section’s table on page 109. For
more accurate temperature, the Referee should use the
Mean Temperature Determination process that starts
immediately after the Basic Temperature section. The
effective HZCO Deviation equation does not provide
simple values for habitable zone breadth determination
but the Referee can plug values into the equation
based on various orbits to determine the bounds
of temperature regions for use in the Step 3d when
placing existing mainworlds in the following section.

PLACEMENT OF WORLDS


With the ranges of available Orbit#s determined
and the location of the HZCO computed, the
Referee can place the worlds within a system. The
placement process assigns orbit slots to stars and star
combinations and determines the Orbit# of each orbit
slot, then places worlds within those slots.

Disclaimer: The placement of worlds is a multistep
process. It is straightforward in single star systems but
possibly complex in multiple star systems, especially
one as complex as the Zed example. In most cases
the results of following this process are workable but
in certain edge cases, both processes and results may
become difficult to implement. As none of the values
determined below for baseline number or spread are
based on underlying physics, and although the process
requires these variables to proceed, the Referee is free
to ignore the dice and impose different values for these
factors if it makes any system easier to develop or better
matches a pre-existing vision of how to distribute worlds
or how the orbits should line up. Likewise, this process
places planets and planetoid belts arbitrarily. To make a
star system match a pre-existing description or a design
the Referee envisions, any planets can be placed as
desired rather than as the dice fall and any available
orbit around any star can be used as an orbit slot.

STEP 1: ALLOCATIONS BY STAR IN SYSTEMS (MULTIPLE STARS ONLY)
Single star systems skip this step. In systems with
multiple stars, planets could orbit different stars. To
determine how many worlds are in orbit around each
star: for every star (or star pair) total the available
potential Orbit#s – determined in the Available Orbits
section on page 38 – and if that star does not have a

**_Effective HZCO Deviation =_**

system worlds and orbits

Orbit# - HZCO
smaller of Orbit# or HZCO



companion but has at least some non-zero number of
allowable orbits, add 1. Once all of a star’s Available
Orbits are added (possibly plus 1), round down any
fractional remainder to determine each star’s Total
Star Orbits.

Total Star(X) Orbits = ∑ Star(X)'s Allowable Orbits (with
fractions) + 1 if no Companion*

*Only if the star had more than zero previously computed Allowable
Orbits

Round down resulting Total Star Orbits to nearest whole number

See the example for clarification. Next, add up the Total
Star Orbits to compute the Total System Orbits.

Total System Orbits = Total Star(1) Orbits + Total
Star(2) Orbits + ... + Total Star(Last) Orbits

Next to determine how many worlds are assigned per
star, multiply the Total Worlds by that star’s Total Star
Orbits and divide by the Total System Orbits.

**_Star(N)Worlds =_**

round up for Star(1), down for Star(2) to (Last–1), assign all
remaining worlds to Star(Last)

Calculate this value for each star starting with the
primary star and working ‘outward’ to stars in their
ascending Orbit#. For the system’s primary star, round
this value up, for intermediate stars, round down, and
for the outermost star, assign all remaining worlds.
The example below walks through this process for a
fairly complex system:

For the Zed system’s total worlds of 17, the allocation
would proceed in this manner:
The total Orbit#s for each star (or pair) was established
when determining multi-star available orbits. Those
values where Star Aab, 13.39, Star B 1.08, Star Cab,
6.36. Star B does not have a companion, so it adds 1 to
its total to get 2.08. This rounds down to 13, 2 and 6 so
Total System Orbits is 13 + 2 + 6 equals 21.

Next, the number of worlds per star is determined for
each star (or pair). Star Aab receives 17 × 13 ÷ 21
= 10.52, rounded up to 11, Star B receives 17 × 2 ÷
21 = 1.62, rounded down to 1, and Star Cab gets the
remainder, which is 17 - 11 - 1 = 5.

STEP 2: DETERMINE SYSTEM BASELINE NUMBER
Although the number of worlds is already determined,
the location and spread of their orbits is not. Some
systems will be compact, with many worlds inside the
habitable zone, while others might be sparce, with
just a few scattered worlds. The baseline number is
the sequence number of the planetary object closest
to the HZCO. In the Sol system, this world is Terra,
and the baseline number is 3. A low baseline number
creates a sparce planetary system with many worlds
in the cold outer zone. A high baseline number
creates a compact system with many worlds inside
the habitable zone entirely. It is possible the entire
planetary system lies inside the habitable zone or that
all the worlds lie outside it.

In some instances, specifically in multi-star systems
with one or more close stars, the HZCO is unavailable
for placement of an orbit. These systems can have two
configurations. In the simplest case, there are no orbits
available to the primary star(s) until beyond the close
stars(s). In this case, the baseline number is set to 0
and the first orbit occurs beyond the orbits not allowed
by the close star(s). This system is considered ‘cold’.

In the second case, some orbits are available to the
primary star(s) prior to the unallowed zone. In this
case, a random number of orbits are available to the
primary stars in this space between their MAO and
the region blocked by the next star(s). This number
may be between 0 and the total number of orbits
allocated to the primary star(s) as determined randomly
or deliberately by the Referee but orbits should be
separated by a minimum of 0.01 Orbits. For these ‘split’
systems, the baseline number is one more than the
number of orbits placed in this inner region.

If the HZCO is available to the primary star(s), to
determine baseline number for the primary star, roll 2D
and apply the listed DMs:

**_Baseline Number =_** 2D + DMs

system worlds and orbits

Total worlds x Total Star(N) orbits
Total System Orbits


Primary star has a companion DM-2
Primary star is Class Ia, Ib, or II DM+3
Primary star is Class III DM+2
Primary star is Class IV DM+1
Primary star is Class VI DM-1
Primary star is a post-stellar object DM-2
Total worlds less than 6 DM-4
Total worlds 6–9 DM-3
Total worlds 10–12 DM-2
Total worlds 13–15 DM-1
Total worlds 18–20 DM+1
Total worlds more than 20 DM+2
For each secondary star DM-1

If the baseline number is greater than the total worlds,
all of the star’s worlds orbit closer than the HZCO; if a
pre-existing mainworld’s characteristics contradict this,
it retains its position but becomes the outermost world
of the system, if possible. If the baseline number is 0 or
less, then all of the worlds have orbits outside the HZCO,
with the same caveat for pre-existing mainworlds, which
would then become the innermost world.

Since the baseline number determines the entire
structure of the system, the Referee should feel free
to modify this result if it creates a system different
from what the Referee envisions. In some multi-star
systems, the Referee may decide to treat each star
separately and determine a baseline number for each
based on their allocation of planets.

For the Zed system, with 17 worlds, the DMs are -2
for the companion and -2 for the secondary stars. A
roll of 9 - 4 equals a baseline number of 5, indicating
_the Orbit# of the fifth world is located nearest the_
primary star’s HZCO.

**STEP 3: DETERMINE SYSTEM BASELINE ORBIT#**
The baseline Orbit# is the actual orbital location of the
world in the baseline number slot. For the continuation
method and when a mainworld is known to be within
the habitable zone, this is the Orbit# of the mainworld.
Determination of the baseline Orbit# can proceed by
one of four methods based on the conditions below:

1. The baseline number is between 1 and the
    system’s total worlds,
2. The baseline number is less than 1,
3. The baseline number is greater than the system’s
    total worlds,
4. An existing mainworld occupies a habitable zone of
    the system. (Continuation Method Only)

If the results of any of these processes place the
baseline Orbit# in an unavailable Orbit#, the Referee
should place the baseline orbit at the nearest available
Orbit# with 2D-7 ÷ 10 Orbit# variance always moving
the orbit ‘into’ the allowable zone regardless of the
sign of the result. In the continuation method, if that
placement is unacceptable because of a known
mainworld environment, the Referee may need to move
stars to different Orbits#.

STEP 3A: BASELINE NUMBER IS BETWEEN 1 AND THE
SYSTEM’S TOTAL WORLDS
If the baseline number meets this condition, then it
should correspond to a world lying well inside the
habitable zone. Determine the exact location of this
baseline Orbit# by rolling 2D-7 and dividing by 10 (or by
100 if the HZCO is less than 1.0) to determine the +0.5 (or 0.05) Orbit# variance.

If HZCO greater than or equal to 1.0:

**_Baseline Orbit# =_** HZCO +

Or, if HZCO less than 1.0:

**_Baseline Orbit# =_** HZCO +

Zed’s baseline number of 5 meets condition a) above
and places the fifth world’s orbit within the habitable
zone. The combined luminosity of Zed’s Aab pair is
1.419 which corresponds to the HZCO being Orbit 3.3.
Rolling 2D-7 to scatter the actual orbit of the fifth world
by +0.5 Orbits results in a -2, making the baseline
Orbit equal to 3.3 + (-2 ÷ 10) = 3.1. Therefore, of the
11 worlds whose orbits are based on the Aab primary,
four worlds are within Orbit# 3.1 and six are further
away from the stars.

STEP 3B: BASELINE NUMBER IS LESS THAN 1
If the baseline number is less than 1, all of the system’s
worlds are further than the primary star’s HZCO. This
is a cold system. The first orbit is beyond a point either
based on the primary star(s) minimum Orbit#, its
HZCO or MAO, whichever is greater. To determine the
baseline Orbit#, subtract this negative (or zero) number (i.e., add the absolute value) - or a tenth of the baseline
Orbit# if the HZCO is less than 1.0 – from the value of
the HZCO and add a variance:

(2D - 7)
100

(2D - 7)
10

system worlds and orbits



If minimum Orbit# greater than or equal to 1.0:

Baseline Orbit# =
HZCO-Baseline Number + Total Worlds +

Or, if minimum Orbit# less than 1.0:

Baseline Orbit# =
Minimum Orbit# -

STEP 3C: THE BASELINE NUMBER IS GREATER
THAN TOTAL WORLDS


If the baseline number is greater than the total worlds,
all of the primary star’s worlds are closer than its
HZCO. This is a hot system. The baseline Orbit#
becomes the Orbit# of the outermost planet circling the
primary star. This Orbit# is equal to the HZCO minus
the baseline number plus the total worlds. If either the
HZCO or the result of this calculation is less than 1.0,
then compute it as the HZCO minus baseline number
divided by 10 plus the total worlds divided by 10. A
variance can be added to the result.

If HZCO – baseline number + total worlds is greater
than or equal to 1.0 then:

Baseline Orbit# =
HZCO - Baseline Number + Total Worlds +

Or, if HZCO – Baseline Number + total worlds is less
than 1.0 then:

**_Baseline Orbit# =_**

HZCO -

If the latter formula still results in a negative number,
then treat the baseline Orbit as the HZCO – 0.1 but no
lower than the primary star’s MAO + the primary star’s
total worlds x 0.01.

STEP 3D: PLACING EXISTING MAINWORLD AT THE
BASELINE ORBIT (CONTINUATION METHOD ONLY)
This step only applies if the pre-existing mainworld
lies somewhere within the habitable zone. If this is
the case, then the mainworld’s Orbit# becomes the
baseline Orbit#.

_+_

When the pre-existing mainworld is not in the habitable
zone, determination of the baseline Orbit# uses one
of the three previous methods based on the baseline
number, however, placing the mainworld is still
necessary. Worlds known as frozen or boiling can
be assumed to have Orbit# values higher (frozen) or
lower (boiling) than any Orbit#s within the breadth of
the entire habitable zone. This matters for mainworld
placement but does not impact the baseline Orbit#
value. If such pre-existing worlds should not exist
because of baseline number values, they are placed in
Orbit#s appropriate to their temperature regardless of
baseline numbers or Orbit#s, if possible.

For a habitable zone mainworld, determining an
unknown baseline Orbit# involves reverse-engineering
the Traveller Core Rulebook’s page 251 Temperature
table to match a range of Orbit#s that constitute
the habitable zone around a star. This allows the
placement of mainworlds of known temperature into
different regions of the habitable zone. The Traveller
Core Rulebook’s temperature determination procedure
takes a 2D roll and applies atmosphere code-related
DMs to the roll to determine the mainworld’s ‘average
temperature’. The unmodified 2D roll can therefore
stand in as a proxy for the relative location of the world
within the habitable zone.

The Habitable Zones Regions table provides the initial
orbital locations for varying baseline climatic conditions,
although Atmosphere-related DMs could modify these

results. Raw roll refers to the 2D roll on the Traveller
Core Rulebook’s page 251 Temperature table without
any of the atmosphere or ‘edge’ DMs applied. The
HZCO Deviation column refers to the difference
between the actual Orbit# and the HZCO.

In cases where both HZCO and the mainworld’s
Orbit# are greater than Orbit# 1.0, the mainworld’s
orbit is simply:

**_Mainworld Orbit =_** HZCO + Deviation

If the HZCO is less than 1.0 and the deviation is
positive:

**_Mainworld Orbit =_** HZCO × (1 + Deviation)

If the deviation is negative:

**_Mainworld Orbit =_**

Average temperature is just that – but a number of
factors can result in large variations from average as will
be detailed in the World Physical Characteristics chapter.

This method assumes the mainworld is in the
habitable zone, meaning its raw roll would resolve
to between 3 and 11. The location of the HZCO
corresponds to a raw roll of 7 on the Traveller Core
Rulebook Temperature table. Different roll results will

change the world’s placement within the range of the
habitable zone, for instance, a raw roll of 8 would
result in a ‘hotter’ or closer orbit with a deviation of
-0.10 Orbit#s from the HZCO.

A temperate atmosphere location does not necessarily
result in temperate conditions on the world’s surface.
The DMs from the atmosphere code can skew the
actual surface temperature significantly. Those DMs are
listed below for easier reference:

Atmosphere 0 or 1 No modifiers but temperature
swings from roasting during
the day to frozen at night
Atmosphere 2 or 3 DM-2
Atmosphere 4, 5 or E DM-1
Atmosphere 6 or 7 DM+0
Atmosphere 8 or 9 DM+1
Atmosphere A, D or F DM+2
Atmosphere B or C DM+6

To determine the raw roll with limited information,
assume the modified roll for a world known to be cold
is 4, temperate is 7 and hot is 10. Many worlds have
no temperature description. They can be assumed to
be temperate unless some other information or the
Referee’s wishes contradict that assumption. With at
least partial information known about the mainworld’s
temperature range and atmosphere, the raw roll can be
reverse engineered by removing the DMs applied to the
atmosphere and estimating the original dice roll.

system worlds and orbits

HZCO


1 - Deviation



The reverse-engineered raw roll is used below to
determine the actual Orbit# of the mainworld, which
is also the system’s baseline Orbit#. For instance,
a hot world with a dense (8 or 9) atmosphere would
have resulted from the assumed result of 10, which
is a raw roll of 9 after reversing the DM+1 for dense
atmospheres. If the HZCO was 3.0 then, from the
Habitable Zones Regions table, the mainworld’s Orbit#
would be 3.0 - 0.2 = 2.8. The Referee can add a linear
variance or an additional fractional digit if desired.

If the mainworld is known to be a moon of another
body – usually a gas giant but possibly any larger Size
world – then place the mainworld’s parent planet in
the baseline Orbit# and designate the mainworld as a
moon of that planet.

If the Orbit#s of multiple stars make appropriate
mainworld placement impossible, e.g., none of the
stars in the system has an Orbit# which corresponds to
the temperature profile of the existing mainworld, the
Referee should consider changing one or more star
Orbit#s to make an appropriate Orbit# available around
at least one star in the system – it does not need to be
the primary star. This will require rework and should
be avoided if possible. Mainworlds whose atmosphere
are outside the range of 4–9 and do not have an
established temperature could be located anywhere
in the system and the Referee can choose where to
place them – locations either near the habitable zone or
outside any star’s 100D jump shadow are more likely,
but not necessary, choices.

STEP 4: EMPTY ORBITS
In some systems the relatively neat progression of
orbits is disrupted by an empty orbit not occupied by a
planet or planetoid belt. Rolls for these orbital slots is
assumed to be performed for the entire system but a
Referee may choose to add more variance to a multi-star system by rolling for empty and anomalous orbits
for each star in the system, rather than for the system
as a whole. For each system (or star) check for the
presence of an empty orbit with a 2D roll on the Empty
Orbits table to determine the quantity.

Empty Orbits
2D Empty Orbits
9- 0
10 1
11 2
12 3

Empty orbits first increase the number of orbital slots
available to a star – to make room for the gap without
removing planets. Each empty orbit adds an orbital
slot to its star(s)’s total orbits. Only stars with some
available orbits can have an empty orbit allocated.
In multi-star systems, if rolling for the entire system,
empty orbits are placed (if possible) in Close, then
Near, then Far star orbits, with the remainder allocated
to the primary star.

For the Zed system, empty orbits are rolled for the
system as a whole. The roll is a 10, indicating one
empty orbit. Since the Near star (B) has a non-zero
number of orbits allocated, it receives the extra orbital
slot – note that this does not necessarily mean the
empty orbit will be placed around the Near star, just that
the extra slot goes to Zed B increasing its allocation
from 1 to 2.

STEP 5: DETERMINE SYSTEM SPREAD
The spread is the average separation between Orbit#s
for the system’s planets and planetoid belts. If the
baseline number is less than 1, treat baseline number
as 1 for spread calculations.

Determine the spread by subtracting the baseline
Orbit# by the Minimum Allowable Orbit# (MAO, see
page 39) for the parent star or the MAO by a parent
star and its companion (see page 38) then divide the
result by the baseline number. This value is the default
fractional Orbit# separating worlds within the system:

**_Spread =_**

In some cases, especially where the baseline number
is 1 or less and planets are plentiful, or if many Orbit#s
are unavailable, the spread can become so large that
the outermost planet in a system would be placed
beyond Orbit# 20. If so, adjust the spread such that:

**_Maximum Spread =_**

For orbits around secondary stars, the spread value for
these stars defaults to the system’s spread value but
if the star (or star and companion pair) range of orbits,
from MAO to the outermost allowed Orbit#, divided by
the number of worlds is more than the system spread,
system worlds and orbits then the spread can be changed to:

(Baseline Orbit# - MAO)
Baseline Number

(Primary star(s) Available Orbits)
Primary's Allocated Orbits + Total Stars

In rare cases, large spread and baseline values and a
series of random rolls may still place orbital slots beyond
Orbit# 20 or a secondary star’s allowed orbits. If so,
the Referee can adjust the spread to a smaller value.
The spread is designed to allow variations of orbital
configurations but cannot account for all variables.

Optional Rule: In addition to the above spread
limitation, for multi-star systems, each star or pair of
stars can have their own baseline numbers, baseline
Orbit#s and spreads, allowing for more compact
planetary orbits around dimmer stars, if desired. Each
spread would apply only to the worlds in direct orbit
around that star or a star and companion pair. The total
worlds DM would then be based on each star’s (or star
and companion) allocated worlds.

The Zed system will not use this optional rule. For Zed,
the baseline Orbit# is 3.1 and the MAO for Aab is 0.61.
Dividing (3.1 - 0.61) by the baseline number of 5 results
in 0.498 which rounds to 0.50.

**STEP 6: PLACING ORBIT#S**
For Orbit#s inside the baseline, add the spread to
the star’s MAO value to determine the slot for the
innermost world’s Orbit#. If the Referee desires
additional variation in Orbit# placement, a 2D-7 roll
times one-tenth of the spread can provide that variety:

**_Inner Slot Orbit# =_**

(MAO + Spread) +

Using an optional variance provides variety at the cost
of complexity. Add the spread to this innermost slot to
determine the distance to the next orbit slot’s Orbit#,
and so on:

**_Next Slot Orbit# =_**

(Previous Slot Orbit#+Spread) +

If using a variance, the Referee should decide
whether to use the un-varied Orbit# value of the slot
as a starting point for the next spread addition. Using

**_Maximum Secondary Spread =_**

cumulative varied values with many inner Orbit#s risks
the chance the Orbit# slot just prior to the Baseline
Orbit# becomes very close to, or possibly even larger
than, the baseline Orbit#. With the expanded method,
the Referee can choose to consider the baseline Orbit#
as only a convention to establish spread, and let all
orbital slots fall as the dice indicate.

Optional Rule: In very compact systems, the Referee
may choose to separate each orbital slot by a minimum
of 10–20% of the distance from the previous slot. Within
an Orbit#, the 10% difference is approximately a 10:11
orbital period resonance; 20% is a 5:6 resonance.
Existing exoplanet orbital resonances of 6:7, (16⅔%)
have been discovered. Beyond Orbit#3, distances
between whole Orbit# start to increase, so this limitation
only applies within the same whole Orbit#. Alternatively,
the Referee may choose to compare orbital slots using
their AU values to determine true separation and orbital
period relationships. The easiest method is to add 10%
to the Orbit# (or AU) if the current orbital slot is within
10% of the previous.

Orbits# slots outside the baseline number slot are
determined by continuing to add the spread to
slots above the baseline Orbit#. If multi-star system
considerations cause an Orbit# result to be unavailable,
then add the width of that exclusion zone to the spread
value to place the next slot.

With Zed Aab’s MAO of 0.61, the Orbit# for the
innermost orbital slot is determined as the MAO plus
the spread of 0.5 and a variance, which in this case is
a 2D roll of 5, so the first Orbit# becomes 0.62 + 0.5 =
1.11 +((5-7) x 0.5) ÷ 10, which is 1.01. This rounds to
1.0 for the fractional orbit, as the Referee has chosen
to stick with a single digit fractional above 1.0. Next,
the second slot is based off this 1.0 to become 1.5 with
a roll of 9 on 2D creating a variance of 0.1 or Orbit#
1.6 for a final value. The third orbit ends up with no
variance and is just 1.6 + the 0.5 spread, or Orbit# 2.1.
The fourth becomes 2.1 +0.5 +a variance of 0.1 or
Orbit# 2.7, and the fifth is the baseline number world
with the predetermined baseline Orbit# 3.1.

For orbital slots outside the baseline, continue to add
the spread and variance, if any: slot six is at Orbit# 3.5,
seven at Orbit# 4.1, eight at Orbit# 4.6.

The ninth slot should be at Orbit# 5.2 but that Orbit#
is excluded by the presence of star B. This exclusion
range is from Orbit#s 5.11 to 7.09 a difference of
essentially 2.0, so adding that difference to 5.2 gives
Orbit# 7.2 as the location for the nineth orbit of Zed
Aab, which is actually the first circumtrinary orbit
around AB. The tenth orbit then proceeds to Orbit#

system worlds and orbits (2D - 7) x Spread

(2D - 7) x Spread

Secondary's Allocated Orbits + 1



7.8 and finally the eleventh is at Orbit# 8.3, which is
still below the star of the next exclusionary zone which
begins after Orbit# 10.1.

For star B now with two slots, its Orbit# will be the MAO
+ Spread. A K8 V star has a MOA of 0.02, therefore the
orbital slot of B’s world is at Orbit# 0.52 and the variance
roll is a 7, so it does not change. The second orbit is
placed at Orbit #1.02, which the Referee rounds to Orbit
#1.0. As this Orbit is below the maximum allowed Orbit#
of 1.1 there is no reason to adjust the spread.

For the star Cab pair, with five orbits to place in the
potential range of Orbit#s 0.74 – 7.1, there is likewise
no need to adjust the 0.5 Orbit# Spread. The pair’s
MAO is 0.74, adding the spread and a variance (rolling
a 10) results in: 0.74 + 0.5 + 0.15 or 1.39, which rounds
to Orbit# 1.4. The second orbit has a variance of -0.1,
so it becomes Orbit# 1.8. The third of Cab’s orbital
locations is 1.8 + 0.5 - 0.05, which rounds up to Orbit#
2.3. The fourth orbit is 2.3 + 0.5 + 0.1 = Orbit# 2.9 and
the fifth 2.9 + 0.5 – 0.15 rounded up to orbit #3.3.

STEP 7: ADD ANOMALOUS PLANETS
An anomalous orbit is one that does not follow the
system’s regular orbit pattern. The planet occupying
this orbit may be a captured body, or just a world in an
unusual orbit, such as one that is inclined, retrograde
or highly elliptical. It could even be a trojan world co-orbiting with another planet either 60° ahead or behind
it in orbit. Roll 2D on the Anomalous Orbits table.

Anomalous Orbits
2D Anomalous Orbits
9- 0
10 1
11 2
12 3

If anomalous orbits exist, the count of terrestrial
planets (and total worlds) is increased by one for each
anomalous orbit. Consult the Anomalous Orbit Type
table for details on this planet’s orbital slot.

Anomalous Orbit Type
2D Description
7- Random orbit
8 Eccentric orbit
9 Inclined orbit
10–11 Retrograde orbit
12 Trojan orbit

The maximum number of terrestrial planets in any
system is 13. If adding anomalous orbit increases this
amount beyond 13, then any additional anomalous
orbits add planetoid belts to the system instead and
increase the total worlds accordingly.

Random orbit: The location of the orbit does not
correspond to the spread pattern. In a multi-star
system, randomly assign the orbit to a star or star pair
that has a non-zero number of allowable orbits. For
the assigned star(s), roll 2D-2 to determine the Orbit#
value and add d10 to determine the fractional value.
If the random roll results in an unavailable orbit, the
Referee can allow some leeway to account for the
orbit’s anomalous nature or can add or subtract 1D to
the Orbit# result; this can be repeated as necessary but
no Orbit# value should be less than the MAO or exceed
20.0. In compact systems, the Referee may choose to
use spread as a multiplier to the 2D-2 roll rather than
Orbit# but should avoid multipliers below 0.5 in systems
with many worlds. A random orbit has a DM+2 when
rolling on the Eccentricity Values table.

Eccentric orbit: Assign the orbit using the random
orbit procedure above but apply DM+5 when rolling on
the Eccentricity Values table.

Inclined orbit: Assign the orbit using a random orbit
procedure above and apply DM+2 when rolling for
eccentricity. Determine inclination by rolling 1D+2 ×
10° and possibly adding d10 for additional variance. In
notes on IISS forms, indicate the orbit as ‘Inclined XX°’
with XX as the number of degrees. As inclination is not
normally considered for Traveller orbits, this may be
more for flavour than for effect.

Retrograde orbit: Assign the orbit using the random
orbit procedure above and apply DM+2 when rolling
for eccentricity. On IISS forms, mark the Orbit# as
within an ‘R’ postscript or a place leading negative
sign in its period field or indicate ‘retrograde’ in the
notes field. If desired, the Referee may also wish to
declare the orbit as inclined and determine inclination
by using the Inclined orbit procedure above and
adding 90° to the result.

Trojan orbit: The planet occupying this Orbit# is either
leading (on a 1D result of 1–3) or trailing (4–6) another
world with the same Orbit# by 60°. Pick the Orbit# the
planet will occupy using the placing worlds procedure
prior to placing any worlds but after placing any other
anomalous orbits. This Orbit# cannot be empty, so
any subsequent roll of empty for the slot with a trojan
orbital companion should be placed in an available
system worlds and orbits unassigned slot using the following precedence:

3. Earth

8. Neptune
9. Pluto

immediately inward, next available outward, random
reroll until an available slot is found. A planet in a trojan
orbit will share the orbital characteristics of Orbit#
and eccentricity, and of inclination, if indicated, as
the other occupant of the slot. The world in the trojan
orbit is considered the least massive of the worlds in
that orbital slot. It is possible, although rare, to have a
planet at both the leading (or L4) and trailing (or L5)
trojan locations of another planet.

For Zed a roll of 10 for anomalous orbits adds an orbit
and a terrestrial world, bringing the total count up to 12
terrestrials and total worlds to 18 and now it needs to
be typed and assigned:

Rolling on the Anomalous Orbit Type table results in
a 10, or a retrograde orbit, which is also random. To
determine the star(s) which the anomalous world will be
orbiting, the Referee considers the three ‘parent’ orbital
groupings of primary(Aab), Near(B) and Far(Cab) and
rolls D3, receiving a 1 and assigning the extra world
to the Aab set of stars. Rolling 2D-2 for Orbit# results
in a 5 with a d10 adding a 2, so 5.2 for the anomalous
retrograde Orbit. This is technically outside the allowed
orbit range because of the nearby star B in orbit 6.10
but as it is close (within 10%) to the allowable limit, the
Referee allows it, rationalising that this orbit could be
in some sort of resonance keep-away from the star or
could be unstable over long periods.

The random orbit from the anomalous world has
been inserted in the primary and companion stars’
Aab Orbit sequence as ‘A1’ to give that pair of stars a
total of twelve orbits.

STEP 8: PLACING WORLDS
After determining all the orbit slots in the system,
worlds are placed into those slots in the following
order: mainworld (if pre-existing), empty orbits, gas
giants, planetoid belts, then terrestrial planets. To
initiate the process, the Referee should list the orbital
slots, starting with the primary star(s)’s slots, then
moving on to any other stars in an outward order.
In complex multi-star environments, Orbit#s around
the primary and other stars, i.e., those with Orbit#
numbers based on the primary star, should be listed
prior to those for the other stars themselves, although
this is not required.

After compiling the list, determine a method to randomly
select an orbital slot. One method to accomplish this is
to assign each slot a number from 1 to 6, repeating as
necessary if more than six worlds exist. Then for each
set of 1–6, assign a prefix number beginning with 1, so
the first orbit will be 1:1 and the seventh 2:1 and so on.
In most systems this prefix number will range from 1 to
2 or 3, although systems with more than 18 worlds will
require a 4. The prefix number can be treated as a D2 or
D3 or even 1D in the case of those very dense systems.
With a 1D prefix, rolls above the top prefix number (6
and likely 5) are rerolled. See the Zed example for a
walkthrough of this process.

Mainworlds with no climate-based pre-existing
information determined could be in any orbital slot but
those with atmospheres 4–9 will almost always be in
the baseline slot or adjacent to it as informed by the
Habitable Zone Regions table on page 42. Boiling
worlds should be placed at least 1.0 full Orbit#s inside

system worlds and orbits



the HZCO (or 0.1 if dealing with Orbit#s less than 1.0),
frozen worlds at least 1.0 (or 0.1) full Orbit#s outside
the HZCO. If the mainworld is known to be a moon,
then both the mainworld and its parent planet should
occupy the proper slot.

If a mainworld is not known to be a moon, but being
a moon is not excluded, this world placement method
may randomly determine a parent planet for it if that
orbit subsequently houses a gas giant. If this occurs,
the system gains one more terrestrial planet to place
in an orbit. If the mainworld is Size 1 and a planetoid
belt is placed in its orbit, the Referee could choose
to roll again or could consider the mainworld to be
inside this planetoid belt as a significant body – in
that case the system would also gain one more
terrestrial planet to place.

For each world (or empty orbit) in the order indicated
above, roll the dice and place the world in the slot
indicated. If a world already occupies the slot, add one
to the result (if it is the last slot in the system, go back
to the first empty slot). The exceptions to this rule are
noted above: mainworlds that could randomly have a
gas giant parent or Size 1 mainworlds that could be
within a planetoid belt. In those cases, the gas giant or
belt becomes the primary ‘world’ of that orbit and the
mainworld becomes a subordinate world in that orbit
and an additional terrestrial world can be placed in the
left-over orbit. Additionally, anomalous orbital slots are
exempt from placement of empty orbits; if this occurs,
roll again.

Once all the empty orbits, gas giants and planetoid
belts are placed, fill the remaining orbits with
terrestrial planets.

For the Zed star system, consider the orbit table opposite.
The ‘empty’ additional orbit slot has been placed in order
as ‘B+’ in the sequence to give B two orbits to allocate.
The random orbit from the anomalous world has been
inserted in the primary and companion stars’ Aab Orbit
sequence as ‘A+’ to give that pair of stars a total of 12
orbits. With 19 orbits, the prefix is 1D with only 1–4 as
valid results and with a following 1D, which on a prefix of
4, anything but a 1 would require a reroll

Since there is no mainworld established, the empty
orbit is determined first as: 3:3 or orbit slot C1. This
is the orbit closest to the Cab pair, so the Referee
decides, for no other reason than it is the Referee’s
discretion to change or alter any of these rolls to create
the desired vision of the system, to modify this result
and use orbit slot C2 (the 3:4 result) instead.

Next, the Referee places the four gas giants and
then two planetoid belts randomly. Ignoring a slew of
rerolls, the results are gas giants at 3:5 (C3), then 1:5 (A5). The next roll is also 1:5 – this already exists, so
1 is added to the second dice to get 1:6 (Aab6) and
finally 2:6 (A11).

Next, the two planetoid belts will be at 3:3 – the one
orbit the Referee did not want empty – this time the roll
stands and it becomes a belt. The second planetoid
belt is at 1:4 (A4).

Next, the remaining orbits (not the one marked as
empty) will be filled with terrestrial planets. The
completed picture of worlds in orbit around the five
stars of Zed look like this:

Orbit
Slot 1D:1D Star Orbit# World
A1 1:1 Aab 1.0 Terrestrial Planet
A2 1:2 Aab 1.6 Terrestrial Planet
A3 1:3 Aab 2.1 Terrestrial Planet
A4 1:4 Aab 2.7 Planetoid Belt
A5 1:5 Aab 3.1 Gas Giant
A6 1:6 Aab 3.5 Gas Giant
A7 2:1 Aab 4.1 Terrestrial Planet
A8 2:2 Aab 4.6 Terrestrial Planet
A+ 2:3 Aab 5.2R Terrestrial Planet
A9 2:4 AB 7.2 Terrestrial Planet
A10 2:5 AB 7.8 Terrestrial Planet
A11 2:6 AB 8.3 Gas Giant
B1 3:1 B 0.52 Terrestrial Planet
B+ 3:2 B 1.0 Terrestrial Planet
C1 3:3 Cab 1.4 Planetoid Belt-C2 3:4 Cab 1.8 Empty
C3 3:5 Cab 2.3 Gas Giant
C4 3:6 Cab 2.9 Terrestrial Planet
C5 4:1 Cab 3.3 Terrestrial Planet

**STEP 9: DETERMINING ECCENTRICITY**
Like stars, planets can – and most often do – have
orbits that are not exactly circular but exhibit some
eccentricity. Planetoid belts do not have intrinsic
eccentricities, but individual planetoids do, and these
can be determined later if desired. For each world,
determine the eccentricity of its orbit around its star(s)
using the Eccentricity Values table on page 27,
adding any DMs listed with the table or received from
system worlds and orbits anomalous orbit types.

Determining a planet’s eccentricity is not required but it
will add realism to a system and may have significant
effects on temperature variability in the course of
a world’s orbit. In some cases, eccentric orbits of
planets may result in crossing conditions. These do not
necessarily raise the risk of collisions, other factors,
such as orbital inclinations and periodicity likely prevent
collisions in these systems, or else at least one of the
crossing planets would not exist – at least not for long.
For example, in the Solar System, the orbits of Neptune
and Pluto cross but the two worlds never come closer
than 17 AU from each other. If the Referee has chosen
to use all six orbital characteristics for all stars and
planets, these factors need to be explicitly explored but
as this is not recommended, they can be assumed to
be in effect for planetary orbits which appear to cross.

DEFAULT PLANET DESIGNATIONS


Planetary designations begin with the star
designation of their component parent or parent
stars. Single star systems will forgo the ‘A’
designation and record planetary designation
directly after the system name. Planets within
a system are designated by Roman numerals,
starting with the closest planet to the parent
star or set of stars. Each new set of ‘parents’
resets the planetary enumeration to ‘I’. A space
separates the roman numeral from the Star(s)
designation. Planetoid belts are not enumerated
as planets – planet enumeration skips a belt
location and continues uninterrupted with the
next planet. A planetoid belt is designated by
the capital letter P followed by a roman numeral
indicating its position among other planetoid belts
of the same parent. For example, a system with a
parent that has, in ascending order from the star,
two planets followed by a planetoid belt, then two
planets and then another belt would enumerate
these as I, II, PI, III, IV, PII. The gas giant that in
the Zed example is located in Orbit#3.1, the fifth
orbit of the Aab pair would be designated Zed
Aab IV as the orbital slot before it is occupied by
a planetoid belt. Planets orbiting multiple stars
should collapse the enumeration to deal with only
the pair lettering, for instance the Zed system
planet in the Orbit# 7.2 is the first to orbit three
stars: Aa, Ab, and B; it would be designated Zed
AB I not Zed AabB I.

PLANETARY ORBITAL PERIODS



(LENGTH OF ‘YEARS’)
A basic value to determine is the time a planet takes
to orbit its sun(s). This is usually straightforward for a
planet orbiting a single star, slightly more complicated
if orbiting multiple stars and even more complicated if
the two bodies orbiting each other have comparable
masses. Regardless of the situation, the first step in
this computation is to convert a body’s Orbit# value into
an AU distance using the fractional Orbit# conversion
to AU formula on page 26. Then determine the orbital
period based on one of these three scenarios:

PLANET ORBITING A SINGLE STAR


Assuming the mass of the star is much larger than the
mass of the planet, the simple formula for determining
orbital period is the square root of the distance cubed (AU) divided by the star’s mass in Solar units (M) or:

**_P =_**

This formula provides an answer in years. Multiply by
365.25 to determine days or 8766 to determine hours.

For the case of the Zed system, the planet Zed B I orbits
a single star. The planet’s Orbit# is 0.52 and the star’s
mass is 0.626. Converting the Orbit# into AU yields 0
+ 0.4 × 0.52 = 0.208 AU. Using the above formula, the
period or year length for this planet is the square root of (0.208^3 ÷ 0.626) = 0.1199 years or 43.79 days.

PLANETS ORBITING MULTIPLE STARS


If a planet orbits a primary and its companion or any
two stars, or even three or more stars, the total mass
of all the stars it orbits around is considered. The
formula then becomes:

**_P =_**

In this case Σ M  is the sum of the masses of all the
stars interior to the planet’s orbit.

The Planet Zed AB I actually orbits three stars, the
primary, its companion, and the Near star, Aa, Ab, B,
at an Orbit# of 7.2. The AU distance = 10 + 10 × 0.2 =

system worlds and orbits

AU^3 (M  )

AU^3 (Σ M  )



12 AU. The total of the three solar masses is 0.929 +
0.907 + 0.626 = 2.462. This results in a period of (12^3 ÷
2.462)1/2 = 26.493 years or, using just the fractional part
for days, 26 years and 180 days.

LARGE PLANETS ORBITING STARS


The formula for orbital periods contains a simplification
as the value M is actual (M + m) with the smaller
case m indicating the mass of the orbiting body. In
most cases, the star will be orders of magnitude
larger than the orbiting body and the smaller mass is
ignored. The below formula is the same used for stars
orbiting another star but can be useful for a massive
superjovian planet orbiting a star. In this case the
m⊕ value uses planetary masses converted to solar
masses by multiplying by 0.000003.

**_P =_**

BASIC WORLD SIZING


If a mainworld is to emerge from the extended
system generation process, the system’s planets and
significant moons need at least basic Size information
to begin determining which worlds may be suitable for
mainworld generation.

TERRESTRIAL WORLD SIZE


The category of terrestrial worlds covers anything
that is not a planetoid belt or gas giant, meaning any
world large enough to be round and yet small enough
to not automatically retain a thick hydrogen-helium
atmosphere. These worlds are often referred to as
terrestrial, meaning not that they have a Terra-like
environment but that they are primarily composed of
metal, rock, and/or ice, less than twice the diameter of
Terra, and in most cases less than 10 [[Terra|Terran]] masses.

Categorising these worlds requires some Size codes
for worlds both smaller and larger than those provided
for in the Traveller Core Rulebook system generation
method. The Basic Terrestrial World Size table provides
the full range of these Size codes.

Basic Terrestrial World Size
Size Basic Diameter Size Basic Diameter
00 (planetoid) 7 11,200km
R0 (ring) 8 12,800km
S 600km 9 14,400km
1 1,600km A 16,000km
2 3,200km B 17,600km
3 4,800km C 19,200km
4 6,400km D 20,800km
5 8,000km E 22,400km
6 9,600km F 24,000km

The Sizes of terrestrial worlds have more diversity than
mainworlds typically exhibit. To determine the size of
these worlds first roll 1D and then make a second roll
as indicated in the Terrestrial World Sizing table.

Terrestrial World Sizing
1D Second Roll Size Ranges
1–2 1D 1–6
3–4 2D 2–C (12)
5–6 2D+3 5–F (15)

Other physical characteristics of these terrestrial
planets will be determined World Physical
Characteristics chapter, if or when necessary.

ORBITAL RESONANCES


Gravitational interactions between worlds and
stars may result in orbits which are multiples of
each other. For instance, in the Solar System,
the orbital periods of Neptune and Pluto have a
2:3 relationship and three of the major moons of
Jupiter have a 1:2:4 relationship in their periods. In
various exoplanetary systems, some known worlds
have orbital periods with resonance relationships,
sometimes maintained in chains across up to
five worlds or in intervals as close to each other
as 6:7. Additional systems have near-resonance
orbits in chains up to seven planets long but most
known systems do not have perfect or even near
resonance relationships between known planets.
Depending upon other bodies in the system, a
resonance relationship can be either stabilising or
destabilising. As this book will make no attempt
to even approximate solutions for what in orbital
mechanics is known as an n-body problem, orbital
resonances are not considered at all. However, the
Referee may choose to alter Orbit#s of worlds or
even stars so that their periods have an exact or
near exact resonant relationship.

system worlds and orbits

AU^3 (Σ M + m⊕^ x 0.000003)

**GAS GIANT SIZE**
Gas giants themselves are never mainworlds but
their moons or rings could be. The size of a gas giant
influences the number and Size of its moons, so to
fully populate the system to determine the mainworld
candidates, gas giants should be at least roughly sized.
If the mainworld is already determined and is not a gas
giant moon, then sizing of gas giants is optional.

Most gas giants range in size from 2–18 times Terra’s
diameter but they do not follow a simple sizing curve.
Instead, they require a 1D and up to two subsequent
rolls on the Gas Giant Sizing table.

The first 1D roll determines the general size category (Small, Medium or Large) of the gas giant. If precision
is not needed, the Referee can stop there. The second
roll based on the initial sizing result row determines
the actual diameter as a factor of [[Terra|Terran]] diameter (1
gas giant diameter unit is equivalent to Size 8). A third
roll based on the initial sizing result determines actual
mass as a multiple of [[Terra|Terran]] mass.

Gas giant information can be recorded using
a modification of the SAH (Size, Atmosphere,
Hydrographics) codes of the UWP. All gas giants
can use the G Size code, with the second UWP
digit indicating gas giant size category instead of
Atmosphere: GS, GM, GL. The third SAH digit for gas
giants corresponds to its diameter in [[Terra|Terran]] diameters
and can use eHex notation as necessary to record the
gas giant diameter from 2 toJ (18). Gas giant mass
can be recorded in the notes field in the IISS Class III
form (see the end of the chapter). The Referee can add
a variance to the mass value for variety but gas giants
should remain within the mass range of 10–4,000⊕.

Rolls and results for determining Size for the example
Zed star system’s worlds are shown on page 56 with
Size codes indicated.

SIGNIFICANT MOONS


A planet may have many moons; some gas giants may
have over 100, not counting large clumps within their
rings. This process determines only significant moons,
those of size S or above and also indicates whether a
planet has significant rings.

QUANTITY OF SIGNIFICANT MOONS


The possible number of significant moons depends
on the Size and Orbit# of the planet. The Significant
Moon Quantity table specifies the quantity rolls for
various planet Sizes, with DMs applying to location
within a system. A negative number result indicates no
significant moons. A result of exactly 0 indicates the
presence of a planetary ring (Size code R).

Significant Moon Quantity
Planet Size Quantity
Planet Size 1–2 1D-5
Planet Size 3–9 2D-8
Planet Size A–F 2D-6
Small Gas Giant (GS#) 3D-7
Medium or Large Gas Giant (GM# or GL#) 4D-6

If any of the below conditions apply: DM-1 per dice
•	 Planet’s Orbit# is less than 1.0
•	 Planet is an orbital slot adjacent to a companion
•	 Planet’s orbital slot around a primary star (or pair) is
adjacent to a Close or Near star unavailability range
•	 Planet is in the adjacent orbital slot to the
outermost Orbit# range of a Close, Near or Far star

A DM per dice is a DM-1 for 1D rolls, DM-2 for 2D rolls,
etc. Only one DM can apply regardless of the number
of conditions applying to a planet. The term adjacent
means the orbital slot lies within the spread distance of
the unavailability zone condition indicated.

system worlds and orbits

_The results call for 32 total significant moons (and_
two rings) across 16 planets. The principle of MOARN
applies strongly here. The Referee is free to detail all
of these worlds but may choose to examine just some
or none of them.

To determine a mainworld using the extended
method, the Referee should determine the
other physical characteristics (atmosphere and
hydrographics) for worlds within the system’s
habitable zone(s). This can be accomplished
by using the procedures in the Traveller Core
Rulebook on pages 250 and 251. Developing these
characteristics further and applying them to worlds
outside the habitable zone will be subjects covered in
the World Physical Characteristics chapter.

The Zed example will continue with the complete
_detailing of the system and its significant planets and_
moons but this is only necessary because it provides
examples of the process. Unless the Referee really
enjoys creating systems or has an automated method
for doing so, it is not recommended or expected for
this level of detail to be developed for even one system
unless it is necessary for the game.

**SIGNIFICANT MOON SIZE**
After determining the number of significant moons,
they can be sized. Moons may range in size from S
to the Size of the parent planet. A result of 0 indicates
a significant ring (R). A planet can have multiple
significant rings, whose properties will be detailed in the
Significant Rings section on page 77. All of these rings
are indicated by a single modified SAH notation of R0#,
where # is the number of significant rings, e.g., Saturn’s
rings are noted as R03.

Gas giants can (rarely) have gas giant-sized moons.
These monstrous moons must be smaller in size
category and diameter than their parent, for example a
Large gas giant with a Size of 12 times Terra’s diameter
can have a moon as large as a Medium gas giant with
a Size of 11 times Terra’s diameter.

Sizing requires a 1D roll to determine the Size range
and a subsequent roll for final Size. An initial 1D result of
1–3 indicates a Size S significant moon of 400–800km
diameter. A 1D result of 4–5 indicates a moderate sized
moon, with a result of zero indicating a ring (R) instead.
On a 1D roll of 6, for a terrestrial planet, roll 1D and
subtract the result from the planet’s Size-1; a negative
result indicates a Size S moon, a 0 indicates a ring.
For a gas giant, a roll of 6 indicates a larger moon and
requires a 1D roll on the Gas Giant Special Moon Sizing
table, followed by a final roll for Size.

Significant Moon Sizing
1D Second Roll Size Ranges
1–3 none S
4–5 D3-10 (R) – 2
6 Terrestrial: Size-1 -1D
Gas Giant: Special

0 (R) – F

If a planet is Size 1, then any moon less than its Size
is Size S. If any terrestrial world’s moon has a Size of
exactly 2 less than its parent body, roll 2D and on a
result of 2 the moon is just 1 Size less than the parent
and on a 12, the moon is a twin world of identical Size
to its primary world, otherwise it retains its current size.

The Gas Giant Special Sizing table allows for larger
moons to exist.

1–3 1D 1 – 6
4–5 2D-20 (R) –A (10)
6 2D+4 6 –G (16)*
*A second roll result of 16 or Size G indicates
that the moon is a Small gas giant. On this result,
determine the characteristics of the moon using
the Small gas giant row on the Gas Giant Sizing
table on page 55. If the moon’s parent gas giant is
a Large gas giant, roll another 2D and on a result of
12, determine the characteristics of the moon as a
Medium gas giant instead.

system worlds and orbits



Completing this process for all of Zed’s planets and
significant moons is a repetitive but straightforward
exercise, below are the results of moon sizing with
each planet’s moon’s size separated by comma in the
order they were generated.

The moon results end up converting four of the moons
to rings, providing rather significant double ring systems
for planets Aab VI and Cab I. A total of 13 moons are
size S, of the remaining 15 moons only three, are larger
than size 2, although one of these is a monstrous
Size A. By chance all three of these large(ish) moons
are theoretically within the habitable zone of the Aab
system, whose HZCO of 3.3 stretches from 2.3 to 4.3.
These three moons of Size 3, 5 and A are among the
best candidates for Mainworld.

INSIGNIFICANT MOONS


The Referee is free to specify insignificant moons by fiat.
These moons are generally considered to be at least
one kilometre in diameter but can approach 400km.
They are often captured planetoids orbiting in inclined,
eccentric, retrograde or chaotic orbits. As a rule of
thumb, a planet can have as many of these moons as its
Size, multiplying Size by eight for gas giants.

The Zed system could have more than 400
insignificant moons, not to mention the denizens of the
two planetoid belts and some other random flotsam
such as cometary bodies. The Referee can toss these
in as plot points if desired.

PLANETARY SYSTEM PROFILE


A star system’s planetary system profile does not
contain much information about the distribution of
worlds or their significant moons but serves as an
overall summary. The profile has a short and a long
form. The short profile follows the format:

G-P-T-N-S

Where G = gas giant quantity, P = planetoid belt
quantity, T = terrestrial planet quantity, N = baseline
number, S = spread. If a baseline number is less than
zero it is recorded as 0.

The longer profile indicates relative position of these
worlds, in the format:

St-N-W-W-W...-S:-N-St-W-W...-S:...

Where St = star designation (A, B, Ab, etc.), N =
baseline number, W = planet type, a G, P, T orM (for
mainworld, if designated – a moon of a gas giant, or
asteroid belt mainworld is indicated as GM or PM,
respectively), and S = spread. For all stars, the N

DEFAULT MOON DESIGNATIONS


A significant moon is designated by an alphabetic
character appended after the name of its parent
world. These moons are ordered from the closet
to the farthest from the planet. A space separates
the planet and moon designation. For instance,
the Size 5 moon in the example Zed system’s
habitable zone would be initially designated as
Aab IV d; the Size A and Size 3 moons would be
Aab V b and Aab V d.

Insignificant moons are often not initially
discovered and occasionally transitory.
Insignificant moons have a numeric designation,
starting with a number one higher than the
number of significant moons and are incremented
in order of discovery, with identical discovery
times ordered by the closeness to the planet. For
instance, the first insignificant moon discovered
around Aab IV would be Aab IV 6. As that gas
giant could have 112 (14 × 8) insignificant moons,
they could range up to Aab IV 117.

system worlds and orbits

is the placement in the string of the world closest
to the HZCO, which might be different than the
earlier determined baseline number, considering the
possibility of empty or anomalous orbits. If all the
worlds are outside the HZCO then N=0, and if all are
inside then N= X.

_The short profile for the Zed system is: 4-2-C-5-0.5. The
long profile for the Zed System (without Mainworld) is:_

Aab-5-T-T-T-P-G-G-T-T-T-0.5:B-2-T-T-0.5:AB-0-T-T-G-0.5:Cab-0-P-G-T-T-0.5

MAINWORLD CANDIDATE


If a mainworld is not designated, a system’s habitable
zones are the best places to initially search for a likely
candidate. The habitable zone is generally considered
to be +/ 1.0 Orbit#s from the HZCO, with results of
Orbit#s less than 1.0 treated as one-tenth as large. For
any likely candidate worlds in this region, the Referee
should roll for additional physical characteristics of
atmosphere and hydrographics with the temperature
raw roll (see page 108) assigned by deviations
from the HZCO changing based on the Habitable
Zones Regions table. For instance, an Orbit# of 3.3
in a system with a HZCO of 3.5 would add 2 to the
simulated raw temperature roll of 7 to make it 9.

This process may provide the Referee with enough
information to pick a mainworld. If not, the Referee can
continue to develop the system’s worlds until finding
a suitable candidate or can randomly pick a world.
The mainworld does not need to be the ‘nicest’ planet
or moon in the system. It could be the one with most
resources, a convenient location for a starport or the
home of the descendants of a shipwreck. The Referee
can choose any world in the system to be the mainworld.
After choosing a mainworld, the Referee may begin to
delve deeper into the physical aspects of the world.

For the Zed system, the HZCO is 3.3 for the Aab
pair of stars, which provides a habitable zone of
Orbits 2.3–4.3, covering both large gas giants, all the
system’s satellites larger than Size 2, and also the
Size A world Aab VI.

For Aab IV d, the Size 5 moon of Aab IV, its
atmosphere and hydrographics can be rolled with a
predetermined Temperature result of9 (Orbit# 3.1
is 0.2 Orbit#s closer than the HZCO and therefore
warmer by +2). Rolling 8 for atmosphere results in
a Standard (6) Atmosphere (2D-7 + Size(5)), which
provides no DM on the temperature table. A roll of 7

for hydrographics results in6 (2D-7 + Atmosphere(6)),
giving the world a temperate environment and
physical characteristics of 566, a little too small to be
classified as a garden world but it could potentially
become a rich and/or agricultural world.

Other worlds in the habitable zone with some potential
for atmosphere or liquid water include the Size 2
moon of Aab IV – this is a stretch as we shall see
later – the Size A and 3 moons of Aab V and the Size
A world of Aab VI. All other moons are Size 1 or S
and therefore have atmosphere and hydrographics
codes of 0. The two moons of Aab V are at Orbit#
3.5, which makes the simulated temperature raw roll
a 5. The planet Aab VI is at Orbit# 4.1 which gets a
raw roll of 3. The results for these four worlds are
200 (temperate), AA6 (temperate), 340 (cold), AB6 (temperate). The 340 cold desert moon of Aab V is at
least survivable with a filter mask but not pleasant as
it has an automatic trade code of poor.

For Star B the HZCO is 0.92, leaving a range of
0.82–1.02 – but since this outer limit crosses 1.0, the
upper limit is 1.2 instead. Planet B II is a possibility
being 0.08 Orbit#s colder than the HZCO, which the
Referee decides is a raw roll of 3 on the temperature
table. Rolling 9 for atmosphere results in an Exotic (A)
Atmosphere (2D-7 + Size(8)), which provides DM+2
on the temperature table, adjusting the result to be 5,
more temperate, but still unbreathable. A roll of 7 for
hydrographics results in6 (2D-7 + Atmosphere(A) -4),
noted for a final SAH of 8A6.

Stars Cab have a HZCO of 0.75, which creates the
range of 0.65 to 0.85, excluding all of its worlds.

Based on these results, the Referee designates Aab
IVd (SAH = 566) as the mainworld candidate and
names it Zed Prime.

IISS PROCEDURAL


The initial survey within a star system is a Class II
survey. Both the exploration and survey branches
of the IISS perform Class II surveys, with the
exploration branch generally limiting their surveys to
‘potentially interesting’ systems far beyond borders of
the Third Imperium, and the survey branch filling in
the gaps, moving outward to cover every ‘mundane’
system. In reality, many ‘potentially interesting’
systems turn out to be rather mundane and some
assumed mundane systems are actually very
interesting. Class II surveys are sometimes conducted
ad hoc, during a refuelling operation enroute to visit a
system thought to be more interesting.

system worlds and orbits



Class II survey information is recorded in RSC
databases using a partial Class III data format. As
much of the data is incomplete and preliminary, it is
not available to the RPSC until the completion of a
Class III survey.

CLASS II SURVEY


After jumping into a system, a Class II survey
establishes the location of all planetary-sized bodies,
major planetoid belts and moons of significant size. The
surveyors note other ‘interesting’ phenomena, such
as obvious signs of civilisation – radio transmissions,
artificial lights on the dark side of a world or actual
spacecraft within the system. The survey does not
detail planets other than to determine Size, and
sometimes Atmosphere, but scans will indicate the
obvious presence of abundant life by detecting certain
combinations of atmospheric gases or clear biological
spectra anomalies from surface vegetation.

A Class II survey requires 2D days to conduct. It does
not generally involve the deployment of probes, except
for triangulation purposes and to detect worlds blocked
by large bodies such as stars or parent planets.
Landing parties are never deployed and contact with
any local sophonts is not attempted. The only physical
contact with a world might be for refuelling at a gas
giant, waterworld or icy body.

At the end of the survey, the SI of the system is 6,
providing a reasonably accurate estimate of the orbits
and Sizes of all planets, planetoid belts and significant
moons. Detailed information is rarely gathered, except
by serendipitous proximity, although the survey does
do a more thorough scan of the habitable zone(s) of a
system and rough information about atmosphere and
hydrographics codes of worlds in that region are noted
for future verification. Any detection of local sophont
inhabitants is also usually serendipitous and distant. It
is noted for future reference and even if the natives are
piloting spacecraft in the vicinity of the scout craft, any
contact and potential detection of the scout vessel and
probes by the locals is actively avoided.

Class II surveys are preliminary and usually followed-up
by a Class III survey of the entire system. The Class II
survey does not have a unique format but uses a Class
II/III Survey data format with a flag marking the data as
provisional and incomplete.

‘Sub’ is an abbreviation for subordinate bodies – in this
case significant moons but it may also include dwarf
planets within planetoid belts. These will be developed
in later chapters. The notes field can include any
relevant profile information or miscellaneous remarks.

EXAMPLES


The information for the Class II/III survey form is
incomplete after a Class II survey but is provided here
as provisional non-public information following a Class
II survey. The completed Class III from will be provided
at the end of the following chapter.

ZED SYSTEM (PAGE 63)
For Zed, partial information has been developed in
the course of the running example and is provided in
this Class II/III form. Eccentricities for the planets were
not done as part of the inline example but have been
added. Moons with a potential for mainworld status are
detailed as separate objects.

CORELLA (PAGE 65)
The Corella system has a known number and type of
worlds in Travellermap.com data. In addition to the
mainworld, there are four gas giants, three planetoid
belts and three other (terrestrial) worlds for 11 total
worlds. It will be detailed using the continuation method.

The two stars have a combined luminosity of 1.74
which computes to a habitable zone centred at the
square root of that value in AU or 1.32AU, which
is Orbit 3.5# – the HZCO value. All 11 worlds orbit
these two stars, so a 2D roll of 6 minus2 (DM-2 for
the companion) for the progression of the habitable
zone world results in a baseline number of 4. Corella,
the habitable zone world is the fourth world in the
system. It is known to be neither too hot nor too cold,
so a variance of -0.2 is acceptable, shifting its Orbit#
from the HZCO of 3.5 to 3.3. The MAO is based

on the primary and companion – Orbit# 0.5 as the
companion’s orbit has no eccentricity. The spread is
then 3.3–0.5 = 2.8 ÷ 4 = 0.7 Orbit#s. The base Orbit#
codes for the first four planets is 0.5+0.7 × planet
number or 1.2, 1.9, 2.6, 3.3. Rolls for empty Orbit#s
indicates one exists and rolls for anomalous Orbit#s
indicates zero. Since the number of worlds is fixed, the
Referee adds one orbit but not another world. There
are now 12 orbits for 11 worlds. This allows a prefix of
D2 followed by a D6 to assign all worlds to orbits.

Corella is pre-placed in the fourth orbital position. The
seventh orbit is determined to be empty and the rest of
the worlds are placed, gas giants followed by planetoid
belts followed by the three terrestrial worlds.

Corella is known to have two ‘medium-sized moons’, so
no roll for moon quantity is necessary. Rolling for size
indicates two Size S moons, which fits acceptably with
the given information.

Consistent with a Class II survey, the other worlds and
their moons have been added but a full SAH has only
been done for those in the HZ. Note the second planet
is barely within the hot edge of the habitable zone and
its large moon is suffering from very hot conditions with
a raw temperature roll of 11.

TERRA/SOL (PAGE 67)
The Solar System is a known quantity but to simulate
the level of detail created for the Zed system, here is a
partially completed form for comparison. The trickiest
part is dealing with dwarf planets. As these reside
within planetoid belts (either the main asteroid belt or
the Kuiper Belt) they can be considered later.

SOL SYSTEM OVERVIEW




The procedures for system creation in the Traveller
Core Rulebook are focused on creating the system’s
mainworld, usually but not always located in a
system’s habitable zone. Procedures in this chapter
allow a Referee to validate the choice of a mainworld
from likely candidates for the extended method and
to detail its physical characteristics if it already exists
as part of the continuation method. These processes
also allow for the creation of the SAH (Size,
Atmosphere, Hydrographics) characteristics of other
worlds within the system.

While the procedures in this section include the
process for creating a world from scratch, in the case of
the continuation method where a whole UWP is known
and in the case of an expanded method where at least
the Size of a world is known, these established values
can be carried forward and act as the starting point for
additional details specific to a world.

These procedures assume a ‘middle-aged’ star system
and are baseline procedures. Modifications to these
procedures for protostar systems (most systems under
10 million years old with planets still under formation
and constant bombardment) and primordial systems (those under 100 million years old with atmospheres
retaining primordial gases and with still chaotic orbits
of minor and possibly major bodies causing frequent
impacts) are covered in more depth in the Special
Circumstances chapter.

This chapter’s procedures will expand the generic
Size, Atmosphere and Hydrographics characteristics
into additional detail and add other information to
make the world unique. A major examination of
conditions and calculation effort will help determine
a world’s surface temperature, with regards to new
factors such as axial tilt, day length, greenhouse
effects and seismic stress. As with all of the
procedures in this book, they build upon basics
introduced in the Traveller Core Rulebook and need
only be taken as far as the Referee desires.

SIZE


The Size characteristic of a world determines much
about its nature but it is a generic value, with a fairly
broad range and no details as to the world’s density,

# W CHARACTERISTICS

## ORLD PHYSICAL

which determines its gravity. Other basic physical details
emerge from a world’s Size and density, including
its mass and escape velocity. World Size is either
determined during system generation in the Basic World
Sizing section on page 54 or is determined by 2D-2
during normal Traveller Core Rulebook world generation.
Each Size corresponds to a range of diameters indicated
on the World Size table overleaf.

If the Referee wishes to introduce world Sizes larger
thanA (10) without the procedures for creating an
entire system using the System Worlds and Orbits
chapter, worlds rolled with 2D-2 that result in Size A
can be rerolled to allow for larger Sizes up toF (15).
This can be done by rolling 1D+9 for Size in these
cases, or, to create a less linear distribution: first roll
1D for a Size A world and on a 4+ increase its Size to
B, then roll 1D again and on a result of 4+, increase
the Size to C, and so on, up to Size F. Beyond Size F,
gas giants almost always form.

If a world is Size 0 and is an asteroid or planetoid belt,
as opposed to a single natural or artificial body, the
following steps are not necessary, and, if applicable,
the detailing of Size-related properties for belts can
proceed in the Planetoid Belt Characteristics section
beginning on page 72.

DIAMETER


The World Size table (page 70) provides conversion
from a world’s Size characteristic to its diameter in
kilometres. The diameter of a world is based on a
span of 1,600 kilometres, or just 400 kilometres in
the special case of a Size S world. The midpoint or
average of the range is an acceptable value to use,
but for greater detail any variance is assumed to be
linear. A roll of two dice can simulate this variance,
with a D3 and a 1D roll to indicate the increase in
diameter from the minimum diameter value of a
particular Size. Add the results from the D3 and 1D
rolls. If the total is 1,600 or more, roll both dice again.

D3 Increase from Minimum
1 +0
2 +600km
3 +1,200km



1D Increase D3 Result
1 +0
2 +100km
3 +200km
4 +300km
5 +400km*
6 +500km*
*Reroll both dice if the D3 result was 3

To achieve even more detail, down to the kilometre
level, roll d10 twice as a d100 to get a number from 00
to 99 and add that number to the determined diameter.

For a Size S world, simply roll on the second table,
rerolling a 5 or 6, and then add that number to 400
kilometres to get the dwarf planet’s diameter. As with
larger worlds, a d100 linear variance can be added to
the result.

COMPOSITION AND DENSITY


The density of a world depends greatly on its
composition. Iron has a density of 7.8 times that of
water and may be even more dense when compressed

by the extreme pressures near the core of a world.
Most ‘rocks’ have a density of about 2.5–3.0 – granite
averages 2.7, basalt 2.9. At very cold temperatures
ammonia, methane and nitrogen form ices lighter than
water, and at the far extremes of cold, ices of hydrogen
are even less dense. Small bodies may be ‘rubble
piles’ half or more composed of empty space and
although rocky, they are overall less dense than water.
In general, the worlds that are larger and hotter will be
denser, but exceptions will always occur.

The formulas based on density are also based on
other Terra-centric units, so the value of 5.514g/
cm<sup>3</sup> is defined as 1.0 or standard density. On this
scale, regular water or ice has a density of 0.181 and
hydrogen ice has a density of 0.0126.

To determine the density of a world, first determine its
basic structure on the Terrestrial Composition table,
then determine its actual density on the Terrestrial
Density table. These tables are suitable for terrestrial
worlds from Size S to Size F – gas giant density could
be reverse-engineered from their diameter and mass if
the Referee wishes.

This table has no DMs but the Referee can choose to add a
linear density between the values on the Terrestrial Density
chart for variability.

**GRAVITY AND MASS**
Gravity is density multiplied by Size. Size in this
case can be determined in two ways, either as world
UWP Size ÷8 (Size of Terra) or as world diameter
in kilometres divided by 12,742 (diameter of Terra).
Either way the formula is:

**_Gravity =_**

For later calculations of factors such as escape
velocity and moon orbital periods, the mass of the
world is important. Mass is proportional to the volume
of a world times its density. Volume is proportional to
the cube of diameter. To determine mass, use one of
the same methods as above to calculate diameter and
use the formula:

**_Mass =_** Density x

Mass allows for the computation of additional
parameters of interest to Referees and Travellers
such as the orbital and escape velocities of the
world. Escape velocity from the surface of a world is
proportional to the square root of the value of its mass
divided by its diameter. To determine a velocity in
metres per second:

**_Escape Velocity (EscV) =_** × 11,186

Divide by 1,000 to determine the velocity in
kilometres per second. To determine the orbital
velocity at the equivalent surface of the planet, divide
this result by the square root of 2:

**_Orbital Velocity (surface) =_** EscV ÷ √2

This number is the velocity required to reach orbit,
ignoring any additional thrust needed to overcome
atmosphere and to gain altitude. To determine actual
orbital velocity (in metres per second) at an arbitrary
height (h in kilometres) above a world’s surface, a little
juggling of formulas provides:

**_Orbital Velocity(h) =_** 11,186 x

In this latter case, use kilometres for the radius (half the

SIZE PROFILE


A Size profile is a concise information summary of
related material, expressing:

S-Dkm-D-G-M

Where S=Size, Dkm = Diameter in kilometres, D =
Density, G = Gravity, M = Mass.

For the Zed system’s proposed mainworld of Size 5,
rather than use the standard 8,000km diameter, actual
diameter is determined by rolls of D3, 1D and d100
as 7,200 + 600 + 300 + 63 = 8,163km. As a fraction of
Terra’s diameter, this equals a diameter of 0.64. Density
is determined by a 2D roll with DM+1 for being closer
than the HZCO (Orbit 3.1 is within 3.3) resulting in 10
+ 1 = 11 or rock and metal. Rolling on the Terrestrial
Density table in the rock and metal column results in
a 9, giving a density of 1.03 (about 5.68g/cm<sup>3</sup> ). With
these values, gravity can be computed as 1.03 × 0.64
= 0.66G, and mass as 1.03 × 0.64^3 = 0.27⊕.. Further
calculations indicate an escape velocity from this world
of 7,262 metres per second and orbital velocity of 5,135
metres per second at the surface and, for example,
4,847 at 500km orbital altitude. This world’s Size profile
is 5-8163-1.03-0.66-0.27.

PLANETOID BELT CHARACTERISTICS


A Size 0 world is a special case. It is not a world at all,
but either a belt of planetoids, a single small body or an
artificial body such as a space station. A Size 0 mainworld
could even be a tiny moon or a ring around another world.
This section will consider the general case, an asteroid/
planetoid belt, whether mainworld or not. The term ‘belt’
will be used below as a generic designation.

Major considerations for a belt are the breadth or span,
its overall population or bulk, the composition of its
bodies and the size and number of its largest bodies.
Size distributions universally favour increasing numbers
of smaller bodies down to countless pebble-sized
rocks but often the majority of a belt’s overall mass is
distributed in just a few large bodies.

BELT SPAN


A belt’s Orbit# is the orbit of the middle of the belt,
halfway between its inner and outer established
boundaries. Individual planetoids, sometimes quite
large, may orbit outside the boundaries of this region
but the majority (80% is the IISS figure) of the belt’s
population have orbits which are centred within this
region. To determine the belt’s span, first consider the
system’s spread value, if it exists. This determines
the adjacent inner and outer orbit slots and forms a
barrier to the spread of the belt – even if one of these
‘next’ orbit slots contains another belt. A belt’s span is
determined by the formula:

**_Belt Span =_**

If the ‘next’ inner or outer orbital slot
contains a gas giant:

DM-1

If the belt occupies the outermost orbital
slot of a system:

DM+3

If a spread has not been determined for a system, use
the value of 2D × 0.1 Orbit# as the spread value in the
belt span determination. A span is the total width of the
belt, meaning the Orbit#s of most of its bodies are plus
or minus half of this value from the belt’s overall Orbit#.

BELT COMPOSITION


Most belts have a varied composition consisting of
metallic (m), stony (s) and icy or carbonaceous (c)
bodies. Other types exist, including peculiar bodies
specific to one or more of a belt’s significant bodies
or the remnants of a destroyed significant body.
The prevalence of one type or another is generally
based on the belt’s location but it can be based on
other factors, such as gravitational scattering or
collisions. A belt inside a star’s habitable zone has
very few c-type bodies, as they are sensitive to
sublimation (evaporating) under the heat of the star.
In outer zones, these c-type bodies predominate
since it is easier for them to form. A 2D roll on the
Belt Composition Percentages table determines the
percentages of each type of body.

If the total of m-, s-, and t-types exceed 100%, remove
any excess % first from m-type, then from s-type. If the
total is less than 100%, then all the remaining % are
allocated as ‘other’ composition.

BELT BULK


A belt’s bulk is an overall factor of the volume of the
bodies comprising the belt. It considers the mass and
density of all the bodies within the belt’s span. A belt
with less dense objects has more bulk and a tendency
to form larger bodies. A belt’s bulk tends to decrease
over time: gravitational interactions tend to eject bodies
and the smallest bodies are subject to interactions with
solar radiation which tends to pull them towards the
sun and eventual oblivion. Subsequent collisions cause
more small bodies and the trend continues. The belt’s
bulk is a relative factor determined by:

**_Belt Bulk =_** 2D2+DMs

System Age DM-System Age (Gyr) ÷2 (round down)
Composition DM+(c-type%) ÷ 10 (round down)

If the belt bulk is less than 1, treat it as 1. For example,
a belt in a system aged 4.5 Gyrs composed of
33% c-type bodies has DM-2 for age and DM+3 for
composition for a total DM+1.

BELT RESOURCE RATING


An asteroid belt does not use the same procedures as a
large world for determining resource rating but instead:

**_Resource Rating =_** 2D-7 + DMs

Bulk DM+bulk
Composition DM+(m-type% ÷ 10) (round down)
Composition DM-(c-type% ÷ 10) (round down)

For example, a belt with a bulk of 4 and composed of
22% m-type bodies, and 18% c-type bodies has DM+4
for bulk and both +2 and -2 (since -1.8 rounds down to
-2) for composition, or DM+4 in total.

If the belt is in an inhabited system with an industrial
trade code and at least TL8, reduce the resource rating
by 1D to reflect previous exploitation. The Referee may
rule that long-exploited belts, regardless of current
trade codes and population levels, have the equivalent
or greater reductions in their resource rating.

As belts always have some resources available, even
if it is only ice for fuel or just salvage of abandoned
facilities, resource rating results of less than 2 are still

world physical characteristics



treated as 2. Ratings above 12 should be reduced to
12, although any industrial depletion can be subtracted
prior to setting this upper limit.

BELT SIGNIFICANT BODIES


A belt may contain significant bodies or worlds of Size
1 or S. These bodies are large enough to be mostly
round and may have complex differentiated interiors.
The Referee may choose to just enumerate the number
of Size 1 and Size S bodies or may choose to develop
Orbit#s or additional details for them. The number of
Size S bodies increases rapidly with bulk and even
more so in the outer system, where the majority of the
bodies are icy. A roll resulting in zero or less significant
bodies of a certain size indicates a lack of such objects.

**_Belt Size 1 Bodies =_** 2D-12 + Bulk + DMs

Belt Orbit# beyond HZCO+3 DM+2
Belt span less than 0.1 DM-4

**_Belt Size S Bodies =_** 2D-10 + (DM +1) × (Bulk + 1)

Belt Orbit# between HZCO+2 and +3 DM+1
Belt Orbit# beyond HZCO+3 DM+3
Belt span greater than 1.0 DM+1

If belt span is less than 0.1 divide the number of Size S
bodies (if any) by 2, (round up).

Optional Variance: If more than 50 Size S bodies exist
and the belt occupies the outermost orbit of a system,
multiply the total by 1D/D3 and add 1D.

To determine the Orbit#: of a significant body:

Belt Significant Body Orbit# =
Belt Orbit# +

Additional 10% variance to the span may be
appropriate to add. To determine the orbital eccentricity
of the body, roll on the Eccentricity Values table on
page 27 with relevant DMs.

Belt Size 1 significant bodies are treated as moons for
the purpose of default naming, using a letter suffix, but
Size S objects, often discovered in a haphazard and

incomplete manner especially in the outer system, are
named in order of discovery with a numeral designation
similar to that of insignificant moons.

The physical characteristics of significant bodies are
based on the general population of the belt. Each
significant body has the same percentage of being
metal, stony or icy as the percentage composition
of m-type, s-type, or c-type bodies. To generate
physical characteristics, the density of each type of
body is determined from the Terrestrial Density table
on page 71 as follows:

m-type Use the Mostly Metal column
s-type Use the Mostly Rock column
c-type Use the Mostly Ice column
other type Roll on the Terrestrial Composition table (page 71) to determine the column

With density established, the Referee can determine
additional physical characteristics as if they were a
normal world. Also, Size 1 significant bodies have
the same chance of having a significant moon as a
terrestrial planet.

BELT PROFILE


A specialised Class IV form exists for belt information
recording but for a Class III survey, a shorthand in the
notes field can record relevant belt information as:

S-CC.CC.CC.CC-B-R-#-s

Where S = Span, C = Composition divided into four
dotted separated fields, as demonstrated in the
examples below, B = Bulk, R = Resource Rating, # =
number of Size 1 significant bodies, s = number of Size
S significant bodies.

The Zed system has two planetoid belts: Aab PI, which
occupies Orbit# 2.7, which is inside the HZCO of that

CHARACTERISTICS OF



SIGNIFICANT MOONS AND RINGS



During expanded method system creation, the
Significant Moons procedures starting on page 55
determined the number of significant moons and
substantial rings of a world and their Size information
but little additional detail.

For a world being developed with the continuation
method whose moons and/or rings are not already
established, the Significant Moons procedure of
checking for moons and rings and determining moon
size can proceed for the mainworld and any other
worlds the Referee deems it necessary.

A moon is no different than a planet in its world
SAH characteristics and moons follow most of the
procedures relevant to planet detailing, but since they
orbit a planet and not one or more stars directly, their
orbits are defined differently. This section will detail how
to determine these characteristics.

**MOON ORBIT LIMITS**
Moon orbits can be expressed in two manners: either
as the distance from the centre of a planet to the
centre of the moon in planetary diameters (PD), or
as that same distance in kilometres. The latter is a
universal fixed scale, but the former is a flexible scale
which helps with the placement of moon orbits around
planets of varying sizes.

A moon can only exist in regions of space where a
planet’s gravitational influence is greater than that of
its star(s) and where the force of the planet’s gravity
is not so strong as to rend the moon apart into a
ring. These bounds are known as the Hill sphere and
Roche limit respectively.

For a planet in orbit around a star (or multiple stars) the
radius of the Hill sphere depends on respective masses
of star(s) and planet and their nearest separation
distance – a value based on both semi-major axis (AU) and eccentricity (ecc). In this equation, the mass
of the planet (m) must be converted to solar units by
multiplying by 0.000003 and M is the total of the mass
of all of the stars that the planet orbits – but not any
orbiting beyond the planet’s Orbit#.

**_Hill Sphere =_** AUx (1 - ecc) x

The result of this equation is the approximate
Hill sphere radius of the planet expressed in AU.
Multiplying by 150,000,000 (or 149,597,870.9) will
provide the Hill sphere radius in kilometres and
dividing that result by the planetary diameter in
kilometres provides the Hill sphere limit for the planet
in planetary diameters (PD):

Hill Sphere (PD) =
Hill sphere(AU) ×

The gas giant Aab IV in the Zed system has an
eccentricity of 0.10. This gas giant, with 14 times the
diameter of a Size 8 world, orbits stars with a combined
mass of 1.836 at a distance of 1.06AU. The gas giant
mass of 1,200⊕ converts to 0.0036 to yield a Hill
sphere radius of 1.06 × (1 - 0.10) × (0.0036 ÷ (3 ×
1.836))1/3 = 0.083AU or about 12,430,000km, which is
69.37 planetary diameters.

While the surface of the Hill sphere is the point where
the gravity of planet and sun(s) balance, it is not the
practical outer limit of an orbiting moon. That distance
is closer to one-half or one-third of the Hill sphere
radius. The one-third number applies to ‘prograde’
moons – those who orbit in the same direction as their
primary, and the one-half number applies to ‘retrograde’
moons – those who orbit in the opposite direction and
which are often captured bodies, not those that formed
in orbit of the planet during initial accretion. Still, for
system generation purposes, the Hill sphere moon
limit can be determined to be one-half the planetary
diameter value of the Hill sphere radius, rounded down.

**_Hill Sphere Moon Limit =_**

For Zed Aab IV, the Hill Sphere Moon Limit is 69.37 ÷ 2
= 34.685 Planetary Diameters.

While the Hill sphere determines the outer limit for
moons, the Roche limit determines the inner boundary.
The Roche limit is based on tidal forces and the
cohesion or density of respective bodies and the
Size of the larger body. Inside the Roche limit, rings
might exist, outside the Roche limit, moons can exist.
This is a simplification and other factors may blur
these distinctions. There are numerous methods and
factors for calculating the Roche limit, but for Traveller,
the formula for a ‘liquid body’, one that considers
deformation of a moon is most likely to accurately model
the borderline between rings and moons. To determine
the Roche limit, the physics requires knowledge of the
primary body’s diameter, the density of the primary (M)
and the density of the secondary body (m).

Roche Limit ≈
1.22 x Planetary Diameter x

As the Roche limit around any one body varies with
the density of the smaller body in question, there is no
single Roche limit formula to apply to any one primary
object. Instead, this book will rely on a major simplifying
assumption: the density of the primary is about twice
that of a reasonable secondary object. The logic for
this relies on rocky worlds being more prevalent in
the inner solar system and their moons being likewise
rocky, but not as massive and therefore on average
less compressed and less dense. In the outer system,
where icy bodies predominate, so do icy moons. For a
gas giant with a metal moon, this assumption provides
a more pessimistic result than reality but for the
purposes of generalised planets and moons, it works
well enough. Using this value, the Roche limit becomes
1.22 × Diameter × (2)1/3 or 1.537 times the diameter of
the planet as measured from its centre. Essentially, this
limit stretches one full planetary diameter above the
surface of a planet.

MOON REMOVAL


If a computed Hill Sphere Moon Limit is less than 1.5
PD, then it is below the Roche limit and no significant
moons can exist around that planet. If moons were

indicated during the creation process, the first of
these adds one significant ring or creates a ring
around the planet if none exists. Any additional moons
are assumed to be long gone, impacted, ejected or
absorbed by the system’s sun(s). If the Hill Sphere
Moon Limit is less than 0.5 PD, then it extends all the
way to the surface of the planet and no rings can exist
either. In practice, any limit of less than 0.55 probably
precludes the existence of rings. Note that these limits
only apply to significant moons. Smaller moons may
exceed these limits, at least temporarily.

MOON ORBIT DETERMINATION


Moons can be formed by accretion processes,
collisions or capture of errant bodies. Regardless of
origin, if they persist, they will be within the bounds
imposed by the Hill sphere and Roche limit. Moon
Orbits are assigned by Planetary Diameters (PD) from
the primary body. Determine the Moon Orbit Range (MOR) by subtracting the Roche limit (rounded to up to
2) from the Hill Sphere Moon Limit (rounded down):

Moon Orbit Range (MOR) = Hill Sphere Moon
Limit(round down) – 2

if MOR is greater than 200, treat MOR as 200 +
number of moons (or actual MOR, if less)

This overall range determines the boundaries of a
planet’s Inner, Middle and Outer moon orbit ranges.
The inner sixth is the planet’s Inner moon range, the
middle third is the Middle orbit range and the outer half
is the Outer range. Next, determine the orbit for each
of the planet’s moons by rolling 1D to determine the
range. If the MOR is less than 60 apply DM+1 to the
this first roll. Roll a second time to determine the orbit
of the moon in planetary diameters (PD).

The result in PD can be rounded to the nearest full
number, or to add detail, a linear variance of 0.5 PD
can be added to each orbital result – to either the
indicated or rounded value. There is a small chance
that this procedure could result in an outer moon
exceeding the Hill Moon Sphere Limit but this is a soft
limit – such moons can exist but receive an additional
DM+2 to checks for retrograde orbits.

Significant moons have been generated and
designated in order, from closest to furthest from the
planet. To maintain this order, roll for the PD of all the
significant moons and then reorder the results from
smallest to largest and apply them to each moon.
Alternatively, if desired, each moon could instead
have its orbit determined in turn and its designation
changed to reflect the new ascending orbital location.
If two moons occupy exactly the same orbit, or if they
orbit close enough for their diameters to overlap, either
move one moon out a further1 (or 1+0.5) PD, or treat
the smaller moon as a trojan moon, giving it the same
orbital characteristics as the larger.

_Zed Aab IV has an MOR of 34 - 2 = 32. It has five_
moons to allocate and gets a DM+1 on the initial 1D roll
to determine location as its MOR is less than 60. For
_the five moons the results are 6.26, 4.13, 21.6, 13.6_
and 28.0, rounded and reordered as 4, 6, 14, 22 and

28. Adding a variance produces 4.5, 6.1, 14.0, 22.0 and
27.9. The habitable moon Zed Aab IV d, or Zed Prime,
is at PD 22, or 22 × 14 × 12,800 = 3,942,400km from its
gas giant primary.

**ECCENTRICITY AND ORBITAL DIRECTION**
To optionally add eccentricity values to moon orbits,
use the Eccentricity Values table on page 27 and apply
DM-1 for Inner orbit moons, DM+1 for Middle moons,
DM+4 for Outer moons and DM+6 for any moons
exceeding the MOR.

To optionally determine the direction of a moon’s orbit,
roll 2D and apply the same DMs as above. An orbit is
retrograde on a result of 10+. A retrograde orbit can be
indicated either by treating an orbital period as negative
or adding a ‘R’ notation after the period.

For Zed Prime, a moon in the Outer range, rolling 2D+4
for eccentricity results in 6+4 = 10, followed by 5÷20 +
0.05 = 0.25 eccentricity. A check for retrograde results
in 7+4 = 11, indicating that the moon is in retrograde
orbit around the gas giant – quite possibly a former
planet captured to become a moon.

Optional Anomalous Moons Procedure: If the
Referee desires additional variation, any planet with
existing significant moons may have one or more

that is anomalous. On a roll of 12 on 2D – either
once for the planet or for each moon – a moon’s orbit
follows the Anomalous Orbit procedures on page 50,
however a random orbit for an anomalous moon is
determined by MOR ÷ (2D-1) PD plus a variance and
must be at least 2 PD.

PERIOD OF A MOON’S ORBIT
The period of the orbit of a moon relies on the same
physical laws as that of planets but the equations are
easier using different units. There are two methods to
compute orbital period, either just the planetary mass
or using the combined masses of planet and moon.
Moons tend to be smaller than their planets in a ratio
similar to that of stars to planets, so for most instances
the equations use the [[Terra|Terran]] mass of the planet as Mp.
If greater precision is required, the moon’s mass must
be computed and the Mp value instead becomes (Mp +
Mm) where Mm is the mass of the moon.

To compute the period of the moon’s orbit using the
planet’s Size and the moon’s PD orbital value:

**_Period (hours) =_** 0.176927 x

Alternatively, using kilometres for the moon’s orbital
distance from the planet in (Orbit(km)):

**_Period (hours) =_** ÷ 361730

Zed Prime orbits its parent planet in 0.17693 × (22 ×
14 × 8)^3 ÷ 1,200)1/2 = 624.69 hours or 26.03 days. Or (3,942,400)^3 ÷ 1,200)1/2 ÷ 361,730 = 624.69, calculated
by the second method, is essential the same answer. If
the mass of the moon was added to either equation, the
result would be 624.62 hours, or about four minutes less.

SIGNIFICANT RINGS


A world’s rings generally occur inside its Roche limit.
Temporary rings may form further out, either early in
a planet’s life or after a collision, but over time these
may coalesce into new moons. As with moons, the
enumeration of rings assumes ‘significant rings’. In
the Solar System, all four gas giants have rings but
Neptune’s are barely dense enough to form coherent
rings and Jupiter’s are only visible under certain lighting
conditions. Saturn has obvious bright rings and Uranus

has rings somewhat more complex than the simple
systems of Jupiter and Neptune but considerably less
massive and wide than Saturn’s. To be considered
a significant ring, this book assumes the ring has
substantial mass, optical depth (ability to block light)
and width – exact values depend upon the size of the
parent body but even Saturn’s relatively faint C ring is
tens of times more massive than all of Uranus’s rings
combined. Brightness is not a factor in significance, as
different material of the same size and mass may vary
in brightness by a factor of 10 or more. By this arbitrary
definition, across the entire Solar System, only three of
Saturn’s rings count as significant and none of the other
planets’ rings are considered such.

Rings have two properties: location and span.
The initial placement of a significant ring uses the
following formula:

**_Ring Centre Location (PD) =_** 0.4 +

To determine each significant ring’s span:

**_Ring Span (PD) =_** + 0.07

If this result causes overlap in the case of a planet
with two rings, move the outer ring further outward
until its inner edge matches the inner ring’s outer
edge. The outer ring's new centre location is
determined adding half of the span of both rings to the
inner ring’s centre location.

If three or more rings exist, the third and subsequent
rings must be moved to be either adjacent to or
separated from the previous rings. If modifying a ring’s
centre location causes that ring’s span to intersect the
planet’s surface (at 0.5 PD), narrow the ring’s span
until the innermost part of the ring is 0.55 PD from the
surface. If an outer ring span stretches beyond the
Roche limit, the ring span remains unchanged and if
this causes the ring to overlap with the orbit of a moon,
then that moon will create a gap in the ring of size in
kilometres of at least three times (roll as 1D+2) the
moon’s diameter in kilometres.

RING PROFILE


Often, the only information recorded about a ring
system is the number of rings, e.g., R01, or R03. A
more detailed ring profile is:

R0#:C-S,C-S, ...

Where R0# = Number of Rings, C = Ring Centre
Location, S = Ring Span, repeated for each ring.

ATMOSPHERE


A world’s Atmosphere code is determined by a roll
of 2D–7 plus the world’s Size. Worlds of Size 0 or
1, or S, do not have significant atmospheres and
automatically have an Atmosphere code of 0. Results
of less than 0 equal 0. A resultant atmosphere code
in the range of 2-9, or D, or E is a gas mix composed
of primarily nitrogen and oxygen – most often as
a by-product of carbon-based lifeforms. These
atmosphere codes are usually only present within or
near the edges of the system’s habitable zone but for
the purpose of mainworld generation, the standard
procedures for atmosphere typing apply. A later
section of this chapter will deal with atmosphere code
generation and classification on worlds far beyond the
edges of the habitable zone.

Variants: While not stated in the Traveller Core
Rulebook, much of mapped and previously developed
Charted Space assumes that worlds of Size 4 or
smaller do not have substantial atmospheres. A variant
of the atmosphere generation procedure can allow a
DM-2 to the atmosphere roll of worlds of Size 2–4. For
extra flavour, the Referee may alternatively choose to
use gravity rather than Size as the governing factor
for the DM, if gravity has already been determined in
the previous section, and instead apply a DM-2 if the
world’s gravity is below 0.4G or DM-1 if it is between
0.4 and 0.5G. This variant can be retroactively applied
during the expanded method, perhaps altering the
candidate choices for mainworld.

Atmospheric composition based on the Atmosphere
code is listed in the Atmosphere Codes table.

Some large terrestrial worlds may be closer to gas
giants in atmospheric composition, Atmosphere code
F is a broad classification of rare and unusual results
and includes some worlds with significant helium and/or
hydrogen gas composition but a code G atmosphere is
one dominated by a thick envelope of primordial helium
and may contain a significant proportion of hydrogen.
A code H atmosphere is nearly indistinguishable from
the atmosphere of a small gas giant and are often
called gas dwarfs. The major component of a gas dwarf
world’s atmosphere is hydrogen; it may have a solid
surface underneath its crushing pressure but while
some armoured vehicles might survive on that surface,
even at TL15 no commercially available suit will protect
a person. In any case, at such extreme pressures
the atmosphere’s tiny hydrogen molecules will soon

penetrate anything less than bonded superdense
armour and will cause havoc with equipment and
personnel. For compatibility, the Referee can choose
to record atmosphere codes G and H as code F with a
subtype of G or F if choosing a world with one of these
atmospheres as a mainworld.

Most mainworlds with an atmosphere code of 4–9
reside within the habitable zone, or they have
atmospheres that allow them to remain survivable just
beyond the zone’s edges, e.g., thin (4 or 5) on the hot
side of the zone or dense (8 or 9) on the cold size. For
the generation of atmospheres of worlds further beyond
the edges of the habitable zone, the procedures in the
Non-Habitable Zone Atmospheres section will produce
more realistic results.

**OPTIONAL RULE: RUNAWAY GREENHOUSE**
An additional consideration is the eventual evaporation
rate of the oceans of hotter worlds and the accelerating
effect of this process caused by further rising
temperatures. This process is suspected of contributing
to Venus’s current incarnation as a roasting hot world
under an extremely dense atmosphere. To simulate
this, the Referee can examine any world within the
habitable zone that has an Atmosphere code of 2–F
and is boiling (adjusted temperature roll of 12+) or hot

(10 or 11) as a result of basic generation – this can
result from a combination of the real roll or Orbit# –
simulated raw roll for temperature and the DMs applied
for Atmosphere code as shown on page 47. For these

world physical characteristics



worlds with a base temperature result of hot or boiling
the Referee can determine if a runaway greenhouse
occurred by rolling 2D:

**_Runaway Greenhouse occurred on 12+:_** roll 2D +DMs

System Age DM+1 per Gyr (round up)
Boiling Temperature (12+) DM+4

If desired, this roll can also be performed on any world
closer than the HZCO, with DM-2 for a world with
Temperate conditions.

Finally, this runaway greenhouse check can also be
performed after detailed temperature determination for
any world where the mean temperature exceeds 303K (30°C). For such worlds, use DM+1 for every full 10°
above 303K instead of the boiling temperature DM.

If the world already has an Atmosphere code of A, B,
C or F+, then the only effect of a runway greenhouse
is to consider the world to be boiling if it was only
considered hot. This can reduce the hydrographics roll
by DM-6 instead of DM-2. For all other worlds, namely
those with atmosphere codes 2–9, D, or E, a runaway
greenhouse converts their atmosphere code to A, B or
C, based on a 1D roll:

The temperature of any runaway greenhouse world
is assumed to be boiling for Hydrographics code
generation purposes, although further detailed
atmosphere and temperature determination may alter
this categorisation. All worlds suffering a runaway
greenhouse receive a DM+4 on Atmosphere code
subtypes determination rolls.

HABITABLE ZONE ATMOSPHERES


While the atmosphere codes are descriptive enough
for most purposes, the Referee may choose to develop
more precise values for both total atmospheric pressure
and the partial pressure of oxygen for a world.

TOTAL ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE


The value that determines an atmosphere’s
classification as thin, standard or dense is its pressure
measured in bar at a defined point, the world’s mean
baseline altitude. For worlds with a globally consistent
major ocean level (most worlds with a Hydrographics
code of 6 or above), the mean baseline altitude is
usually defined as mean sea level. For more land-dominated worlds with multiple ocean or sea levels or
with none at all, an average value of sea levels or often
just the world’s mean diameter is used instead.

To determine a more precise atmospheric pressure of
a world, use a linear variance across the atmosphere
code’s span as indicated in the Atmosphere Codes
table. The first formula that follows assumes a linear
approach with two standard six-sided dice but the
requirement is to provide a linear result between 0 and
1 to multiply by the span, so a real or emulated roll of
d100 ÷ 100 is just as valid:

Total Atmospheric Pressure (bar) =
Minimum Pressure Range + Span x

or

Total Atmospheric Pressure (bar) =
Minimum Pressure Range + Span x

Round results to two or three digits. This procedure is
valid for determining the Atmospheric pressures for any
Atmosphere code with a value listed in span column of
the Atmosphere Codes table.

OXYGEN PARTIAL PRESSURE


The factor that most makes a world habitable, to
humans at least, is the partial pressure of oxygen
in the atmosphere. This value is computed from the
percentage of oxygen in the atmosphere. For most
habitable worlds, this oxygen fraction will range
between 10 and 30%. Values higher than this range
make a world prone to widespread fires which tend to
destroy enough flora to reduce the oxygen production
and values lower than the range indicate an immature
or dying ecosystem, neither of which will likely remain
stable over long periods.

The partial pressure of oxygen of Terra is 20.95% of
its atmosphere, or 0.212 bar of the 1.013 bar average
atmospheric pressure at sea level. Without use of
compressors or filters, unmodified humans can adapt
to long term survival under oxygen partial pressures
world physical characteristics

(1D - 1) x 5 + 1D - 1

d100
100

between 0.08 and 0.60 bar, although anything beyond the
range of 0.1 to 0.5 bar will be difficult for an unacclimated
human. Worlds whose pressure range is within the
bounds of thin, standard or dense atmospheres (0.43–
2.49 atmospheres) where the oxygen partial pressure is
outside this narrower 0.1–0.5 bar range are considered
tainted with a low or high oxygen trait (see below).

To determine the fraction of oxygen in the atmosphere
of worlds with Atmospheres 2–9, D or E:

**_Oxygen Fraction = + +_**

**_or +_**

System age greater than 4 Gyr DM+1 to 1D roll

*If using d10, treat it as a range of 1-10

The Referee may add a linear variance of 0.005 for
finer detail.

Optional DMs: For greater realism, the oxygen fraction
roll can also have a negative DM for younger planets.
The below DMs may be reasonable, but they will
generate more ‘immature’ worlds with low oxygen than
the Referee might want in a universe. These DMs are
only recommended for use with the extended method
of system generation.

System Age 3-3.5 Gyr DM-1
System Age 2-3 Gyr DM-2
System Age less than 2 Gyr DM-4

This results in a value from 0–0.4. If the value is0 (or
less with the optional DMs method), then determine it
instead as 1D × 0.01, plus a variance, if desired.

Multiplying this fraction by the total atmospheric pressure
will give the partial pressure of oxygen (ppo) in bar:

**_Partial Pressure of Oxygen (ppo) bar =_**

Oxygen Fraction x Total Atmospheric Pressure

If a breathable Atmosphere code of 5, 6 or 8 is
already established and the partial pressure of oxygen
determined by this procedure is outside the range of
0.1 and 0.50 bar, the Referee may choose to alter the
computed values for either ppo or total pressure or both
to bring the ppo back into the ‘safer’ 0.1–0.5 human
range. Otherwise, the Referee may choose to alter the

Atmosphere code of the world to its tainted equivalent (4, 7 or 9) and use high or low oxygen as at least the
first factor in its taint (see taint type on page 82). This
latter method works well for newly created systems
using the extended system generation method but it is
not a practical choice for existing defined mainworlds
during in the continuation method.

If a Referee wants to specify the concentration of other
gases in the atmosphere, then for nitrogen-oxygen
atmospheres (2–9, D, E) most of the remaining gas
will be nitrogen. The Referee can use 1D ÷ 3% or
some other method to generate a random number of
about 0.3–2.0% for other gases such as argon, carbon
dioxide or neon. Concentrations of carbon dioxide
above 0.015 bar will result in a gas mix taint type.

Alternatively, on worlds which can retain significant
helium, (see the exotic atmosphere gases section
starting on page 86) helium may be a major non-oxygen component in addition to nitrogen, especially
for dense and very dense atmospheres.

SCALE HEIGHT


Another factor to consider for worlds is the rate at
which atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude.
This is the scale height of the atmosphere, a number
corresponding to the altitude at which the pressure
drops by a factor ofe (the base of natural logarithms,
approximately 2.718). Each multiple of the scale height
decreases the atmosphere by another factor of e, and
interpolation of values can approximate atmospheric
pressures at different altitudes. The formula for
determining scale height (H) is proportional to the
world’s temperature (T in Kelvin) divided by its mean
atmospheric composition (M – the mean mass of one
mol of atmospheric particles) and its gravity (g):

**_Scale Height(H) ≈_**

The scale height value for Terra is approximately 8.5
kilometres. Assuming near-[[Terra|Terran]] temperature and
atmospheric gas mix, scale height can be assumed
to be roughly 8.5 kilometres divided by the world’s
gravity. Worlds with lower gravity will have ‘higher’
atmospheres, all other things being equal. A similar
effect will influence the height of terrain features, with
worlds of lower gravity being able to support taller
mountains – again with all other things being equal.
This book will use the approximation:

**_Scale Height(H) ≈_**

This should be roughly valid for worlds with Atmospheres
of 2–9, D and E and temperate climates. For greater
precision, scale height will be less as temperatures
become colder (use the Kelvin scale for the magnitude
of comparison, assuming 288K as the value for Terra)
and increase as temperatures become warmer:

**_Scale Height(H) ≈_**

Another result based on scale height that can be
of interest to any Traveller climbing a mountain or
descending into a chasm – and even more important
in the case of Atmosphere D and E worlds – is the
pressure at an arbitrary height (a). This is equal to the
mean pressure (m) divided by e raised to the power of
the arbitrary height(a) divided by the scale height (H) or:

**_Pressure(a) =_** Pressure(m) ÷

This equation requires both H and height(a) to be
expressed in the same units (usually kilometres).

ATMOSPHERE PROFILE


For worlds with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere, a
minimal shorthand record of the atmosphere needs to
consider most of all the oxygen partial pressure of the
world. The profile is written as:

**_A-bar-ppo_**

Where A = Atmosphere code, bar = atmospheric pressure
in bar and ppo = partial pressure of oxygen in bar. For
instance, for Terra it would be 6-1.013-0.212. The exotic
atmosphere profile (see page 88) and any taint profiles (see page 84) can accompany this information after a
colon, e.g., 6-1.013-0.212:N 2 -78:O 2 -21:Ar-01.

Zed Prime’s Atmosphere is 6, meaning standard with
no taint. To determine its actual atmospheric pressure,
take the lower range value standard (0.7) and add
a variable portion of the span (0.79). Using the six-side dice only method: rolling 1D-1 for 2,which gets
multiplied by 5 to 10 and adding 1D-1 for 3 results in
13, so the pressure is 0.7 + 0.79 × 13 ÷ 30 = 1.0423,
rounded to 1.042 bar.

Oxygen partial pressure benefits from the age of the
system (DM+1) so it is rolled as (1D+1 ÷ 20) + (2D-7
÷ 100) with 1D = 5 and 2D = 5, the result is (5+1) ÷

20 + (5-7 ÷ 100) = 0.28 or 28%. Multiplied by the total
atmospheric pressure, this results in an oxygen partial
pressure of 0.292 bar. This is a little rich for the uninitiated
but perfectly breathable. Fire risk is rather high at a
29% mix but within an acceptable range. Assuming
all other factors being equal, scale height is computed
as proportional to 1 ÷ G or 8.5 ÷ 0.66 = 12.88km. The
pressure at an arbitrary height of 5km above the mean
baseline altitude would be 0.707 bar, with oxygen partial
pressure at that altitude of 0.206 bar. A basic atmosphere
profile for Zed Prime would be 6-1.042-0.292.

SUBTYPES: TAINT
Some worlds have nitrogen-oxygen atmospheres
that would be perfectly breathable but for some small
component or an odd ratio of gases. Humans consider
these worlds to have tainted atmospheres, although
their native life and perhaps other starfaring sophonts
might find the atmosphere perfectly acceptable.
Likewise, other species may find issue with worlds
humans consider pleasant. The determination of taint
is human-centric. Taint applies to Atmosphere codes
2, 4, 7, and 9. Taints have a subtype, a severity and a
persistence. To determine the cause of this taint, roll 2D
and consult the Taint Subtype table.

even another result of 10, requiring a roll for a third
subtype of taint. A world should have no more than
three taint conditions.

If a world of Atmosphere 4, 7, or 9 has already been
determined to have a low or high oxygen taint, this
condition is the first taint subtype for that world. A roll
is still required to check for a result of 10. On a result
of 10, particulates become the second taint subtype
for the world. Another roll is now necessary but only
on a 10 does a third taint condition occur and this third
subtype is determined by one final roll.

If the resultant taint subtype becomes low or high oxygen
as an outcome of a roll on the Taint Subtype table, adjust
oxygen partial pressure to be less than 0.1 or greater
than 0.5 by -1D/100 or +1D/10, respectively, lowering
the oxygen percentage and replacing it with nitrogen
or some other gas, keeping the atmospheric pressure
constant. When rolling on the Taint Subtype table to
determine taints or irritants of any atmosphere of a code
outside the range of 4–9, results of low or high oxygen
are treated as a gas mix (G) irritant instead, as do any
second or third taints resulting in oxygen level taints.

Biologic (B): A biologic taint results from airborne
or surface microbes. These could be virus, bacteria,
fungi or some other microscopic organism causing
harm if inhaled or touched. A result of a biologic taint
or irritant forces the world to have a Biomass rating (see page 127) of at least 1.

Gas Mix (G): The composition or percentage mixture
of various atmospheric components is harmful to
humans. This could be trace gases such as carbon
monoxide, or an irritant such as low levels of chlorine
or fluorine. It could also be excess percentages
of carbon dioxide (more than 0.015 bar can be
hazardous) or certain mixtures of nitrogen and oxygen
that lead to nitric acids or ‘acid rain’ under certain
conditions. Excessive ozone or very high fractions of
oxygen (usually, but not always, more than 30%) can
also cause this taint. Nitrogen partial pressures above
2 bar can also cause a gas mix taint.

High Oxygen (H): The partial pressure of oxygen is
above 0.5 bar. Some levels above this may be tolerable
for short periods. Up to 0.6 may be tolerable with
acclimation but higher levels will cause oxygen toxicity
after longer term exposure.

Low Oxygen (L): The partial pressure of oxygen
is below 0.1 bar. Ranges near this level might be
survivable with acclimation but levels below 0.06

bar will always cause cell damage and eventual
death unless significant medical interventions such
as genetic manipulation or lung modifications are
employed. Unlike other taints, a filter mask will not
counter the effect of low oxygen; a respirator is
required just as if the Atmosphere code was very
thin (2 or 3). If the atmosphere was already very thin,
tainted (2), then a more powerful respirator at twice
the cost of a standard unit is necessary.

Particulates (P): The atmosphere contains airborne
particulates such as dust, smoke or industrial
pollutants. These particulates often cause haze,
smog or other visibility impairments and are
hazardous to inhale.

Radioactivity (R): Radioactive gases such as radon
may be present in harmful concentrations. This taint
may also arise from a world lacking a strong protective
magnetic field to block cosmic radiation. It may result
from a magnetic field that interacts with the surface,
or it may occur from external conditions such as solar
activity or the magnetic fields from nearby gas giants
or neutron stars.

Sulphur Compounds (S): Sulphur compounds are
present in the atmosphere. These gases may be
volcanic or biologic in origin. On worlds that are cold
or frozen (with mean temperatures below 273K)
treat sulphur compound (S) results as particulates (P), instead.

TAINT SEVERITY AND PERSISTENCE


The effects and severity of taints vary greatly. In some
instances, acclimation or inoculation can alleviate the
consequences for residents even if the taint remains
a factor for short-term or unprepared visitors. In other
cases, the taint requires filters or other equipment for
all inhabitants. Genetic or surgical alterations may
overcome the effects of some taints. The detrimental
impact of taints varies from irritant to potentially lethal
levels. This can be established at the discretion of the
Referee or randomly by rolling on the Taint Severity
and Taint Persistence tables. If a world has multiple
taints, the severity and persistence of each can be
rolled separately.

Taint Severity and Persistence is an optional property.
It can be ignored, or the Referee can use the tables for
inspiration without making a roll. These tables are also
used for determining the Severity of irritants in exotic,
corrosive and insidious atmospheres.

12+ 9 Rapidly lethal: death within 1D minutes Filter masks and protective clothing required

High and Low Oxygen taints DM+4*
Insidious Atmosphere (C) DM+6

*Optionally, for these taints, set severity to levels
specific to ppo: for low oxygen, Severity = 2 if ppo is at
least 0.09, 3 if ppo is at least 0.08 and 8 or 9 if ppo is
lower. For high oxygen, Severity = 2 if ppo is less than
0.6, 7 if ppo is less than 0.7 and 8 or 9 if ppo is higher.

Some individuals may overcome a minor irritant. This
could come from immunity, acclimation, the will to
ignore an uncomfortable environment or some genetic
advantage. A person may attempt to surmount this
taint twice: once on first exposure and again after
1D months of acclimation. This acclimation does
not need to be continuous but only full months of
exposure – with filter masks and daily exposure to the
environment, count towards this acclimation period.
Filter masks and/or TL10+ medical intervention is also
always effective against minor, surmountable and
trivial taints. A medical procedure involves surgery

or genetic manipulations and costs 1D × Cr1000 ×
minimum TL, though some worlds may offer free or
reduced cost procedures to entice colonists.

Occasional taints that occur periodically can be
triggered by seasonal effects, lifecycles of native
organisms, the proximity of external objects, such as
a secondary star or an eccentric planet, or some other
regular event determined by the Referee.

TAINT PROFILE


An atmosphere’s taint(s) or irritant can be written as:

**_T.S.P_**

Where T = Taint type, S = Severity and P = Persistence.
For instance, a biologic major irritant of fluctuating
persistence can be recorded as B.4.5. Multiple taints
are listed separated by a comma

The mainworld of the Zed system does not have a
taint but the fourth moon of Aab V, with a SAH of 340,
does. Prior to checking for taint, the Referee performs

some detailed generation on this moon to ensure that it
_does not automatically suffer from the low oxygen taint._
A quick generation of Size-related stats for Aab V d
yields a 5,225km mostly rocky world with 0.65 density,
resulting in a gravity of 0.27 for a 0.045⊕ mass body.
Moving on to atmosphere, its pressure is thin, 0.544
bar, of which 21% or 0.114 bar is oxygen – enough to
avoid an automatic low oxygen taint.

_But the atmosphere is definitely tainted, so rolling_
for taint subtype (with DM-2 for Atmosphere 4) and
getting a 12-2 = 10, results in particulates and another
roll, which is a 5-2 = 3:radioactivity. This poor moon
has both a particulate and a radioactive taint. The
Referee decides that the result of particulates comes
from windblow dust and sand on the desert world
and radioactivity comes from radiation belts around
the gas giant. Rolling for the particulates results in a
severity of 6:hazardous – so a dangerous combination
of particles – and persistence of 3:occasional and
lingering – so that supports the interpretation of the
taint as periodic dust storms. The radioactivity taint is
5:serious and 4:irregular, likely meaning that the moon
resides near the edge of the radiation belt and only
occasional changes in solar activity or other factors
causes the radiation belt to penetrate the atmosphere.
So, visitors to this moon could occasionally be
safe from all taints but sudden dust or radiation
storms could cause one or both conditions to occur.

Protective equipment of a filter mask and a very good
sunscreen (or protective clothing) prevents long-term
damage to visitors and inhabitants. An inhabitant
wishing to use medical procedures to become immune
to both taints would require two procedures but even
then, skin damage from sharp particulates driven by
dust storms likely requires at least some protection
and radiation protection likely requires an expensive
treatment – if available at all. The subtype codes for
this world’s taints are P.6.3 and R.5.4.

SUBTYPES: EXOTIC (A)
An exotic Atmosphere code (A) is unbreathable but
otherwise not overly hazardous. This can result from
a simple lack of oxygen in a pure or nearly pure
nitrogen atmosphere, such as on a world with an
absent or very immature ecosystem, or it can result
from a variety of gases not compatible to human
life, such as carbon dioxide, methane or ammonia.
The category of exotic can range widely in pressure
and may contain a number of irritants. This variety
of atmospheres is optionally further detailed by the
Exotic Atmosphere Subtype table.

Irritant is the exotic equivalent of a taint. This could
require the donning of protective equipment in
addition to oxygen tanks to survive. The Referee
can use the Taint Subtype, Severity and Persistence
tables from the preceding Subtype: Taint section

to determine the nature and dangers of the irritant.
Irritant gases can include ammonia and various
compounds of nitrogen and sulphur.

Occasional corrosive atmospheres contain components
such as chlorine or fluorine or other compounds
which at some times and some locations make the
atmosphere dangerous enough to qualify as corrosive (B). Treat such atmospheres as having a gas mix (G)
irritant with a roll of 1D+9 on the Taint Severity table
and a roll of 1D+1 on the Taint Persistence table.

More detailed atmospheric pressures for exotic
atmospheres can be determined from pressure range (bars) and span using either of the total atmospheric
pressure (bar) equations on page 80.

EXOTIC ATMOSPHERE GASES


The actual composition of an exotic atmosphere can
vary widely and include more than one gas. In most
cases these atmospheres will include inert gases
such as argon or krypton, and on young or more
massive worlds, neon and possibly helium gas may be
present in substantial quantities. The major factors in

determining possible gas mixes are the world’s mass,
temperature, age and the relative natural abundance of
different elements or molecules.

For Referees who just want a quick answer to gas
compositions, the Atmosphere Gas Mix Tables section
starting on page 85 provides a quick reference based
on atmosphere type and temperature. For those who
wish to explore possibilities with greater realism, the
following section provides this detail.

Caution: In most cases, detailed interactions
between gas types and other chemistry-related
factors are not considered in this section. Such
interactions may cause some gas combinations
to be unstable over geological periods. This is not
intended to be a chemistry textbook.

Over time – a billion or more years – lighter gases will
gradually migrate to the top of a world’s atmosphere
and statistically reach escape velocity, especially
at higher temperatures and lower gravities. The
Atmospheric Gas Composition table provides
possible gases that can exist in exotic, or really,
any, atmospheres. A gas is possibly retained in the
atmosphere over long periods (more than a Gyr) if
its retention value is less than the mass of the world
divided by its diameter and temperature and if the
gas in question remains gaseous at the temperatures
on the world. Each gas listed has an escape value
based on its molecular weight, with heavier molecules
receiving a lower value. Heavy molecules such as
carbon dioxide and chlorine are more likely to be
present on smaller planets than light gases such as
methane and ammonia but these heavy gases may
be liquid or solid on the worlds that are too cold. An
assumption for this book is that only those worlds
capable of retaining hydrogen ions are considered
likely to remain gas giants or dwarfs over their multi-billion-year lifespans.

Gas Can Exist if its Escape Value on the Atmosphere
Composition meets the criteria:

< 1,000 ×

In the above formula, M and D are the world’s mass
and diameter in terms of units of Terra and K is the
temperature in kelvin. The temperature can be a rough
estimate, with an assumption of about 290 for the HZCO
and 340 and 240 as the habitable zone extremes.

*Carbon monoxide (CO) is only stable over long periods in the absence of liquid or gaseous water (H 2 O). Over time CO
will react with H 2 O to create CO 2 and H 2 or, under higher pressure, formic acid (CH 2 O 2 ). At most temperatures CH 4 or
CO 2 will be more common but at temperatures above 900K CO will be more dominant that CH 4 in most atmospheres.
This note exhausts the book’s (author’s) chemistry knowledge; other gases could have similar restrictions.

The Referee is free to include gases which fail the
retention value test in a world’s atmosphere but
such gases would then usually need a source of
replenishment, such as underground reservoirs
released by volcanism or artificial supplementation
by technological means. For worlds younger than
one Gyr, the Referee may also choose to divide the
retention value for a gas by two or more. This table
can be used to examine the possible atmospheric
composition of a world’s taint as well. The code
or chemical formula is an optional subtype value
used to describe the major gas or gases in any
atmosphere. The taint column indicates whether the
gas is automatically considered a taint or irritant.

However, any gas, including oxygen and nitrogen,
could potentially be considered a taint at certain
concentrations and under certain conditions.

If the temperature of the world is greater than the
Boiling Point (K) of the gas, that gas can potentially
be a component of the atmosphere. If the temperature
is only above the Melting Point (K), the gas could be
a component of the world’s seas or might even fall as
rain. Both Boiling and Melting Points can vary based
on atmospheric pressure. These values are based
on standard atmosphere and pressure. The relative
abundance value is an arbitrary and rough value
proportional the molecule’s likely abundance, although

world physical characteristics



this can vary widely across different worlds and
systems. In the Atmospheric Gas Composition table
the abundance of oxygen gas is relatively lowered,
as it can readily combine with other elements such
as carbon and sulphur. Likewise, the prevalence of
relatively inert gases such as helium, neon, argon and
even nitrogen are slightly elevated. The Referee can
use the abundance to estimate the probability of a
gas being present in an exotic atmosphere and/or its
relative abundance in that atmosphere.

EXOTIC ATMOSPHERE PROFILE


An exotic atmosphere’s subtype is simply recorded
as A–St# with A as the atmosphere code and the #
indicating the subtype code. Irritants are recorded in
the same manner as taints. If desired, the Referee
can append a colon and the codes for the 1–3 most
prominent gases as XX:YY:ZZ, or if using percentages
as XX-##:YY-##:ZZ-##, with ## equal to the two-digit
whole number percentage of the gas. If desired and
computed, the bar value of the total atmospheric
pressure can precede the gas mix. For example, an
exotic subtype 4 atmosphere of 0.55 bar composed of
75% nitrogen, 20% carbon dioxide and 4% argon, with
a serious(5), irregular(4), particulate(P) irritant, may
be recorded as A-St4 P.5.4, or A-St4:N 2 :CO 2 :Ar P.5.4,
or A-St4:N 2 -75:CO 2 -20:Ar-04 P.5.4, or A-St4:0.55:N 2 -
75:CO 2 -20:Ar-04 P.5.4 depending on the detail a
Referee chooses to include. The full profile is of the
form:

A-St#:bar:XX-##:YY-##:ZZ-## I.S.P

I = irritant type – equivalent to taint type, followed by
the taint profile components

As an example, this section can also allow a Referee to
examine if the desert moon Aab V d should really retain
a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere. Its values are mass =
0.045, diameter = 0.41 and first guess temperature =

240. This results in an escape value of 0.457. Checking
the table, this is only good enough to retain sulphur
dioxide and heavier gases. The retention value would
need to be 0.75 or 0.86, to retain oxygen or nitrogen,
respectively, and higher still to retain water. As the
system is 6.3 billion years old, some other factor
such as terraforming by the Ancients or continued
outgasing from deep reservoirs of nitrogen and oxygen-rich materials must be replenishing the atmosphere.
A moon in orbit around a gas giant, especially
accompanied by another large moon (see the Seismic

Stress section on page 125) might experience enough
tidal activity to remain geologically active even late
into middle age and could still be spewing gases into
the atmosphere. But it is little wonder this desert moon
has lost all surface water, as water vapor has an even
higher escape value than oxygen and nitrogen.

To examine a world with an actual exotic atmosphere
in the Zed system, look to another moon of Aab V. The
second moon has an SAH of AA6. First, back up and
determine the moon’s actual diameter, density, gravity,
and mass, rolling to get 15,992km (1.255⊕), 0.94,
1.18G and 1.86⊕, respectively.

Next, a 2D roll on the Exotic Atmosphere Subtype
table results in 9:dense, irritant. Actual atmospheric
pressure is rolled as 2.09 bar. Using the Taint Type
table to check for irritant results in 9+2 (for the
dense atmosphere) = 11:radioactivity, probably from
radiation belts as this is a gas giant moon. Rolling for
severity and persistence results in 2:surmountable
and 9:constant – indicating a low level of radiation
reaching the surface that can be countered with
supplements and/or minor medical interventions. Now,
with information on mass and diameter and using
a 290K value for temperature (a concession for the
dense atmosphere, although greenhouse factors will
be covered in depth later) for this super-earth-sized
moon, the resulting escape value is 5.1, enough to
retain everything except hydrogen and helium. The
gases with boiling points above 300 are all of the rest
except water (good, since it would be best to stay
liquid) and hydrochloric acid.

To determine the actual atmospheric composition of
Aab V b, the Referee can look at the remainder of the
gases and their abundance. Of these, the prevalent are
gases based on carbon: methane, ethane and carbon
dioxide. Oxygen is the next prevalent but as the world
has an exotic atmosphere, the Referee rules that free
oxygen does not exist, although it may be combined
with another element to produce a gas such as carbon
dioxide. The Referee chooses to have this world’s
atmosphere dominated by nitrogen, carbon dioxide
and methane. Its subtype code could be written as:
A-St9:2.09:N 2 :CO 2 :CH 4 with an irritant of R.2.9. The
Referee can assign % values to these gases if desired,
based upon their relative abundance and some
randomisation. This atmosphere may cause a greater
greenhouse effect (again, something which could be
examined later) but recomputing the escape value limit
even at 373K results in a value more than twice that
required to retain methane.

**SUBTYPES: CORROSIVE (B) AND INSIDIOUS (C)**
Atmosphere codes B and C are corrosive and
insidious. Insidious is like corrosive, only more so.
Proper protective equipment and countermeasures can
counteract a corrosive atmosphere almost indefinitely
but an insidious atmosphere will defeat even the
best protective equipment in a manner of hours or, at
best, days. These atmosphere types might have the
same component gases as exotic atmospheres but in
concentrations, pressures or temperatures which make
them continually hazardous.

For both corrosive and insidious atmospheres roll on
the Corrosive and Insidious Atmosphere Subtype table
with the DMs indicated.

Size 2–4 DM-3
Size 8+ DM+2
Orbit less than HZCO-1 DM+4
Orbit greater than HZCO+2 DM-2

*If the atmosphere became Exotic because of a runaway
greenhouse check

More detailed atmospheric pressures for these
atmospheres can be determined from pressure range (bars) and span using either of the total atmospheric
pressure (bar) equations on page 80.

Consult the Possible Gas Composition table on
page 87 or the Atmosphere Gas Mix tables section
beginning on page 95 to determine likely corrosive
and insidious components. At extreme pressures
and temperatures, even relatively benign gases such
as nitrogen or carbon dioxide can be considered
corrosive as the atmosphere will require special
protection against the crushing heat. The planet
Venus is an example of a world with a corrosive
atmosphere of this type (subtype D). Only insidious
extremely dense atmospheres should have pressures
exceeding 1,000 bar.

A corrosive or insidious atmosphere may include an
irritant if indicated by type. The Referee can use the
Taint Subtype, Severity and Persistence tables from
the preceding Subtype: Taint section to determine the
nature and dangers of the irritant.

In addition to a possible irritant, an insidious
atmosphere always has an inherently hazardous
component. This could be a particular gas, a
combination of gases, or even a factor such as high
levels of radiation that is not necessarily directly an
atmospheric concern, although it could manifest in
radioactive gas isotopes or secondary effects from
radioactive reactions with existing gases. Unlike
an irritant effect, these hazards are considered
automatically lethal and constant, and their hazard
code is added directly to their subtype. To determine
the type of insidious atmosphere hazard roll on the
Insidious Atmosphere Hazard table.

Atmosphere is extremely dense DM+2

Biologic (B): A lifeform, possibly of exotic biochemistry,
or even an organism based on plasma is a virulent
danger to equipment and possibly to carbon-based
lifeforms. A result of a Biologic hazard forces the world
to have at Biomass Rating (see page 127) of at least 1.

Gas Mix (G): Consult the Atmospheric Gas
Composition table and select appropriate hazardous
atmospheric components. Some surprising situations
can lead to insidious effects. For instance, an
atmosphere composed of high pressure high
temperature water vapour can be extremely damaging
to materials. Another potentially insidious effect is
hydrogen gas which will infiltrate all but the highest
technology armour (TL15+), and cause an explosive
reaction when mixed with oxygen.

Radioactivity (R): Either as an effect of radiation
belts, natural deposits or radioactive isotopes in the air
itself, exposure outside of extremely heavily sheltered
environments is often rapidly fatal. Radiation levels
are 1D × 100 rads per exposure – compare radiation
absorbed with protective suit Rad ratings and apply
surplus radiation for every hour of exposure. Exposed
equipment will degrade even with decontamination.
Treat non-hardened equipment as under the constant
effect of an EMP weapon of TL6 +1D.

Temperature (T): Most often this is an issue of very
high temperatures, either caused by solar radiation,
atmospheric pressure or volcanic activity – some
worlds may be inundated by oceans of magma. In
rare cases, extremely cold temperatures – below 5K

- may cause damage to equipment and overwhelm a

suit’s heating capabilities. At 4 K, helium becomes a
superfluid, flowing up walls, acting as a superconductor
and causing other unexpected effects. Insidious
subtype D or E always has a temperature hazard.

CORROSIVE AND INSIDIOUS ATMOSPHERE PROFILE


Profiles for these atmospheres are similar to those for
exotic atmospheres. For a corrosive atmosphere it is:

**_B-St#:bar:XX-##:YY-##:ZZ-## I.S.P_**

For an insidious atmosphere it includes the hazard
code in the form:

**_C-St#.H:bar:XX-##:YY-##:ZZ-## I.S.P_**

With H = hazard code and I = irritant, followed by the
taint profile components. Insidious atmospheres of
subtype D and E inherently include hazard T and only
their additional hazard is normally indicated after the
subtype. As with exotic atmosphere profiles, bar:XX-
##:YY-##:ZZ-## are optional profile components.

In the Zed system, the world AaB VI has a SAH of
AB6 and resides in the outer regions of the system’s
habitable zone. The size profile determined for this
world is A-16134-1.03-1.30G-2.09. Rolling on the
Corrosive and Insidious Atmosphere Type table
results in a 4 with DM+2 for Size = 6:standard. Total
atmospheric pressure is rolled as 1.21 bar.

Next, determine the gas mix that makes this world
corrosive: although in the outer part of the habitable
zone, the slightly higher pressure makes a temperature
of about 290K feasible for the escape value calculation
which then becomes 1,000 x 2.09 ÷ 1.266(diameter)
÷ 290 = 5.87, which allows everything but hydrogen
and helium as major components. Since neither
temperature nor pressure makes the atmosphere
corrosive, some nasty gases must be the cause.
Ammonia may have the highest probability of causing
issues, especially in high quantities. Rather than mix
ammonia with nitrogen, of which it is a component,
perhaps it would be better to make the other major
component carbon dioxide, which makes for a nice
corrosive world recorded as B-St6:1.21:NH 3 :CO 2.

TYPE: VERY DENSE (D)
A very dense atmosphere is a nitrogen-oxygen
atmosphere whose pressure is too high to support
human life at its mean baseline altitude. A human can
experience oxygen toxicity from prolonged exposure
of over 0.50 bar and will experience nitrogen narcosis

world physical characteristics

- a degradation in function similar to euphoria or
intoxication – at partial pressures of nitrogen above 2.0
bar. Other gases that are normally non-toxic will cause
narcosis in high enough concentrations, with helium
perhaps being the least dangerous, with tolerance of
pressure of up to 40 or more bar. In most instances it
will be the levels of nitrogen and oxygen that cause a
very dense atmosphere to become unbreathable.

Nitrogen narcosis becomes a very severe impairment
at levels above 5.0 bar. Treat all tasks occurring in a
high nitrogen environment as having a negative DM
equal to the nitrogen partial pressure minus 1 bar.
Round this DM in the check’s favour, e.g., the partial
pressure of nitrogen must be at least 2.0 bar for a DM-1
and becomes DM-2 only at 3.0 bar.

There is no acclimation process to eliminate nitrogen
narcosis but medical procedures, similar to those for
overcoming taint factors, are possible. For oxygen
toxicity, beyond 0.6 bar, there is no treatment – the high
levels of oxidation cause damage to tissues that can
only be overcome by protective filters and/or clothing.

A very dense atmosphere ranges in pressure
between 2.5 and 10 bar. Thicker atmospheres
of nitrogen-oxygen are possible but these are
considered extremely dense and are a subtype of
unusual (F) atmospheres, as they have very limited
altitudes where they are survivable. On worlds with
considerable terrain height variation, especially those
at the lower ranges of very dense atmospheres,
certain uplands might have low enough pressures
to support human life. Computing the density of
nitrogen and oxygen at different heights above mean
baseline altitude can determine where the atmosphere
is breathable. A very dense atmosphere follows the
same procedures as Atmospheres 2–9 to determine
the oxygen partial pressure (see page 80) and
determines the nitrogen partial pressure based on the
guidelines provided in that section.

Scale height (see page 81) is the major determinant of
this pressure and is inversely proportional to the world’s
gravity. As worlds with very dense atmospheres tend
to be large and likely have higher gravity, their scale
heights will tend to be lower than Terra’s 8.5 kilometres.
On Terra, only four mountain peaks exceed this height.
Higher gravity and weathering from the effects of the
very dense atmosphere may eliminate any suitable
land on many worlds with these atmospheres, leaving
only the skies available for a comfortable existence. At
TL10 and above, this can lead to grav-supported flying
cities. At lower Tech Levels, cities held aloft by balloons
of lighter or heated gas might support sky settlements.

Habitable locations are defined by the minimum safe
altitude for long-term survival and occur at altitudes
which meet both of the following criteria:
•	 Nitrogen partial pressure < 2.0 bar (though < 3.0
might be acceptable)
•	 Oxygen partial pressure < 0.5 bar (though < 0.6
might be acceptable)

A derivative of the scale height formula – with help
from a computer or calculator – can help determine the
required altitude by taking the worst violation of these
two criteria and comparing it to the safe level of that gas:

First, determine the ‘bad ratio’, or the ratio the worst
offender must be reduced to be safe:

**_Bad Ratio =_**

Next, determine the minimum safe altitude as a
multiple of the scale height. The natural log (ln) of the
bad ratio times the world’s scale height is equal to the
minimum safe altitude:

**_Minimum Safe Altitude =_** ln(Bad Ratio) x Scale Height

world physical characteristics

Pressure of 'bad' gas at mean baseline altitude
Safe Pressure of bad gas



If the minimum safe altitude for nitrogen causes
oxygen levels to be below 0.1 bar, then a compressor
would still be required to thrive and no level of
the world’s atmosphere would be compatible with
unprotected human existence.

At the Referee’s discretion, very dense atmospheres
may also have a taint on a 1D roll of 4+. If a taint
is present, the Referee can use the Taint Subtype,
Severity and Persistence tables from the Subtype: Taint
section on page 83 to determine the type(s), Severity,
and Persistence of the taint. The format of the profile of
a very dense atmosphere is similar to that of standard
atmospheres but the leading character is a D.

TYPE: LOW (E)
A low atmosphere is in some ways the opposite of a
very dense atmosphere. At mean baseline altitude,
the low atmosphere is undisguisable from a very thin
atmosphere but because it occurs on a massive planet

- usually Size 9 or above, the world has a low scale
height, and deep valleys or other natural depressions
may retain an atmosphere thick enough to be
breathable. In some cases, worlds with low atmosphere
levels may have artificial depressions created to
support habitable regions.

Scale height equations apply to negative altitudes. To
determine the altitude below mean baseline altitude
required to support life, first determine the oxygen
partial pressure (ppo) using the same procedures as for
Atmospheres 2–9 and then divide 0.1 (or 0.08 for the
extreme limit of human tolerance) by that number. This
should result in a value greater than 1.0. This number
is the ‘low bad ratio’:

Low Bad Ratio =

Next, compute the natural log (ln) of the low bad
ratio and multiply it by the scale height. The result is
the altitude below mean baseline altitude required to
support human life:

Safe Altitude Below Mean Baseline Altitude =
ln(Low Bad Ratio) x Scale Height

Nitrogen will increase in density in proportion to oxygen.
If the low bad ratio times the nitrogen partial pressure
increases nitrogen levels beyond 2.0 bar, it is possible
nitrogen narcosis may begin to affect unprotected
humans and as a result, no safe altitude exists on
the world. As with very dense atmosphere worlds,
the Referee may choose to impose a taint on low
atmosphere worlds on a 1D roll of 4+. The format of the
profile of a low atmosphere is similar to that of standard
atmospheres but the leading character is an E.

SUBTYPE: UNUSUAL (F)
An unusual atmosphere is a category best described by
what it is not: it is not habitable without protection and
it is neither entirely corrosive nor insidious in nature. It
may be composed of an unlikely or rare combination
of gases, or it may have a varying composition based
on seasonal or other factors. Its density could be
anything from very thin to beyond very dense. It could
be a steamy world where an atmosphere of mostly
water vapour blends nearly seamlessly into a boiling
ocean as atmospheric pressures increase. It could
also be a variation of the low atmosphere with different
gases segregated by altitude: perhaps benign at some
layers and corrosive or worse at others. The Unusual
Atmosphere Subtypes table lists some of these
possibilities. It is intended as a prompt for the Referee
but could be used to randomly create an unusual
atmosphere, subject to the conditions listed. A random
occurrence of Atmosphere type F normally only occurs
on worlds of Size A or greater. Note that three of these
atmosphere types have prerequisites and should be
rerolled if the world does not meet the requirements.
Alternatively, the world’s other properties could be
altered to meet the prerequisites.

UNUSUAL ATMOSPHERE PROFILE


An unusual atmosphere can use the same format
as an exotic atmosphere, with subtype listed. If the
atmosphere has more than one subtype, they can be
listed one after another, separated by a period. The
minimal format for an unusual atmosphere with two
conditions would be:

**_F-St#.#_**

Where # = each subtype.

**WHAT COLOUR IS THE SKY?**
It depends. Many different factors can account for
the colour of the sky on a particular world. On Terra,
the sky is blue because of Raleigh scattering, which
preferentially scatters sunlight’s shorter wavelengths

- those wavelengths towards the violet end of the
spectrum. The sky is actually violet but human eyes
are not optimised for violet, so they see it as blue.
That is the first problem with this question: the answer
depends on who is viewing. Aliens could see the
sky very differently. Their eyes may be optimised for
different wavelengths of light, or they might not be
able to see colour at all.

However, the rest of this answer will just discuss what a
human would see. The sun puts out light in a broad band
of wavelengths – colours – and absent an atmosphere
it would look white to human eyes (until they burn out
from staring at the sun). If the sun were a laser putting
out only one wavelength it would likely look green but
no stars look green. Hotter stars will put out more of
their light at shorter wavelengths, shifting the default sky
colour further into the violet and ultraviolet but human
eyes are likely to perceive this more as a darker blue –
indigo, perhaps, rather than violet.

Starting from the bluest blue a human can perceive,
the sky can only get redder. The amount of reddening

depends on the star – a red dwarf may actually look
rather yellow-orange in space but it puts out very little
blue light to scatter. The other factor in reddening
is atmospheric density. In a vacuum, there is no
scattering of light and the sky is black. Once enough
scattering occurs, the sky takes on a colour and
the more atmosphere that sunlight needs to pass
through, the redder the sky will tend to look. That is
why the horizon is not as blue as the zenith and why
the sun and sky appear redder near sunset. Dense
atmospheres will redden the sky. All other things being
equal, the sky of a world with a dense atmosphere
orbiting a red dwarf will look rather yellow, fading to
orange and red near the horizon.

But all other things are not necessarily equal. Any
atmosphere with a taint, especially if the taint is
particulates or sulphur compounds, will take on a haze
and likely turn redder. This is likely but not necessarily
so. It depends on the size of the particles and how
they scatter light. Dust on Mars makes the sunset blue.
Atmospheres outside the 2–9 (and D and E) range
have their own rules. Depending on their composition,
different molecules and different particles will absorb
and scatter light differently. There are no fast and easy
rules except for this: a wavelength of light has to be
present to be visible. The skies of a world around a red
dwarf will not have very much violet or blue to scatter in
the first place and may actually look a little green.

world physical characteristics



NON-HABITABLE ZONE ATMOSPHERES
Mainworld generation procedures heavily favour
worlds within the habitable zone, or +1 Orbit# from
the habitable zone centre. Atmosphere codes 2–9,
D and E, all assume a nitrogen-oxygen mix, which
brings with it the secondary assumption of familiar
carbon-based lifeforms and liquid water. Nitrogen
might be a common component of many atmospheres

- it is fairly common, stable and gaseous down to
very cold temperatures but oxygen is associated – at
least in the Solar System – with biological activity.
As a common gas and component of water, ice and
many minerals, oxygen is even more prevalent than
nitrogen as an element but its reactivity seems to
limit its existence as a plentiful atmospheric gas
outside of living worlds. Temperature variations from
the greenhouse effect (see a further development of
temperatures, beginning on page 110) or from very
thin or very dense atmospheres may push the limits
of the habitable zone further sunward (for very thin
or low) and outward (for very dense) but in general,
worlds beyond even these more generous habitable
zone boundaries will not possess standard 2–9, D or
E Atmospheres.

On the hot side of the habitable zone, the temperature
component of the escape value equation for the
Atmospheric Gas Composition table (see page 87)
implies that many worlds, especially smaller ones, will
simply lack an atmosphere. Those which retain an
atmosphere will tend towards trace, exotic, corrosive,
and insidious types. On the cold side of the habitable
zone, smaller worlds may retain an atmosphere, but
only within certain temperature ranges. The colder the
world, the more likely its ‘heavy’ retained gases will
have turned into solids or liquids, though few liquids
will remain liquid under very low pressures.

To create atmospheres for worlds outside the
habitable zones, roll 2D-7 plus Size on either the
Hot Atmospheres or Cold Atmospheres tables in the
column appropriate for the world orbit’s deviation
from the HZCO. Divide by 10 for a HZCO below 1.0
and change the increment back to normal once past
Orbit# 1.0.

An example of a hot world is the innermost planet of
the Zed system’s central stars: Zed Aab I, a SizeB (11)
world in Orbit# 1.0, a full 2.3 Orbit#s inside the HZCO.
It determines its Atmosphere type from the HZCO
-2.01 or less column of the Hot Atmospheres table. A
2D roll of 5 results in 5-7 + 11 = 9, which is corrosive (B). Despite that result satisfying the Class III survey
form for the world’s SAH, further generation on the
corrosive and Insidious Atmosphere Type table is a 2D
roll of 7 to which DM+2 for being Size 8+ and DM+4 for
being sunward of the HZCO results in a 13 for subtype
code D:‘extremely dense, temperature 500K+’ which is
perhaps not surprising for a world so close to its sun;
Zed Aab I might be termed a ‘Super-Venus’ world.

As examples of cold worlds and the concept of HZCO
increase across 1.0, the two outer worlds of Zed’s Cab
stars are useful. The HZCO value for Zed Cab is Orbit#
_0.75. The first 0.25 Orbit# values count as 2.5 Orbit#s_
on the Orbit# 0.x scale, then Orbit# increments begin to
accrue normally. The World Zed Cab II is at Orbit# 2.9;
_its effective orbit beyond the HZCO is 2.5 plus (2.9-1.0_
= 1.9) or 4.4, which means it uses the HZCO +3.01 or
more column on the Cold Atmosphere table. With a Size
4 world, a 2D roll of 10 results in 10-7 + 4 = 7, which is
exotic (A), standard, irritant – looking back at the Exotic
Atmosphere Subtype table, this is subtype 7. Only an
A need be added as the SAH atmosphere code, but to
continue further, rolling within the standard atmsphere
range results in a pressure of 0.98 bar. No roll for partial
oxygen pressure is required for an exotic atmosphere.
For irritant, rolling on the Taint table results in 8:sulphur
compounds, but as this is a cold world, it is treated as
a more generic result of particulates instead. Roll for
severity gets 4:major and for persistence 7:varying.

Looking also at Zed Cab III, a Size A world which is
further out at orbit 3.3, no math is necessary, since it
is further out than II, so already in the colder column

of the Cold Atmosphere table. A 2D roll of 10 results
in 10-7 + 10 = 13 or gas, helium (G) – this world has a
thick helium atmosphere and might even have some
free hydrogen for those who wish to do the extra
work to attempt to skim it but landing is likely to be
impossible for a normal spacecraft.

ATMOSPHERE GAS MIX TABLES


Although the Referee can customise atmospheric gas
types for exotic, corrosive and insidious atmosphere
types based on the Atmospheric Gas Composition table
on page 87, a quicker method to determine random
atmospheric mixes uses the tables and guidelines in this
section. Each of the following tables provides random
results based on the temperature range and atmosphere
type. The Referee should roll at least twice for gas mixes,
with either the first roll or most common (closest to 7 on
each table) determining the primary gas component. If
desiring a percentage mix determination, the primary gas
can be (1D+4) × 10% (with variance, but only up to 100%)
of the mix, and the other(s) the majority, or (1D+4) × 10%,
of the remainder but allowing multiple results of the same
gas to add to an existing percentage until 95% or more of
the atmosphere is determined. To ensure no gas receives
100%, the Referee can instead choose to use (1D+3) ×
10% for each roll.

Caution: Other than the notes on carbon monoxide,
these tables do not take chemical interactions into
account and may also result in rarer gases (krypton,
argon, or neon) becoming a dominate portion of the
atmosphere. Referees should remain free to alter the
results and/or the percentages of results from these
tables. The tables are for simplicity and inspiration
and need not be followed slavishly.

For the Zed system examples, Aab I has a corrosive
Atmosphere, with a subtype of D: ‘extremely dense,
temperature 500K+’. Rolling on the Boiling Atmosphere
Gas Mix (HZCO -2.01-) table and using the corrosive
column with DM+1 for Size results in 11:ammonia
as the major component. To determine how much
ammonia, a 1D roll of 1 results in 50%, with a d10
roll of 2 for variance, or 47% ammonia (NH 3 ). Rolling
again on the same column for the next gas results in
a 5:carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), which is then determined
from the remaining 53% to be 65% of that amount or
about 34.5%, leaving 18.5% for a third roll of 7:carbon
dioxide – again but that is a feature, not an issue

- being 73% of that remainder or 13.5%. Now, the
atmosphere stands at 48% CO 2 and 47% NH 3 , with
5% unaccounted for. The Referee can leave this as
‘other gases’ but interested in seeing if the next roll
changes the dominant gas rolls 8:water vapour at 60%

world physical characteristics

of the remainder, or 3% of the total. Leaving the world
as 48% CO 2 , 47% NH 3 , 3% H 2 O and 2% other gases,
_the Referee notes the profile as B-StD:CO_ 2 -48:NH 3 -
47:H 2 O-03 and moves on.

The world of Zed Cab II has a frozen (HZCO +3.00+)
exotic Atmosphere (A), subtype 7. Temperature
determination has not been performed on this
_world, and likely never will, but as it is effectively 4.4_
Orbits beyond the HZCO with a standard density
atmosphere, the Referee rules that it deserves the
DM+3 for a mean temperature between 70 and 100K.
A DM-3 for Size 4 nets DM+0 on the table rolls. The
_first roll is 7:nitrogen (N_ 2 ) for 64% of the atmosphere.
The next roll is also a 7, adding another 89% of 36%
or 32% nitrogen to make the total 96%. The Referee
could stop but rolls again for a 3, adding argon at 95%
of the remainder or 3.8%. The world’s atmosphere
is 96% nitrogen 3.8% argon, 0.2% other gases or
A-St7:0.98:N 2 -96:Ar-04 P.4.7.

HYDROGRAPHICS


The hydrographics percentage is fairly
straightforward to generate and comprehend for a
world in the habitable zone with water as its liquid
surface cover component. It is the rounded value of
the tenth of the planet covered with water as shown
on the Hydrographics Ranges table. Generation is
based on atmosphere, rolling 2D-7 and adding the
Atmosphere code, with certain modifications. Size 0
and 1 world have a Hydrographics code of 0; those
with Atmospheres code 0,1, A or greater have a
DM-4 to the roll.

Temperature can also influence the Hydrographics
code. Even in the Traveller Core Rulebook, applying
the modifications of DM-2 for hot and DM-6 for
boiling temperature worlds requires an aside into
temperature determination. As described in Step 3d
of the Placement of Worlds section on page 43, the
Referee can substitute the world’s location within the
habitable zone as a proxy for the ‘temperature roll’
and add the DMs noted in that section to determine
a provisional temperature range for the world. This
provisional temperature range can determine DMs for
the hydrographics roll.

Hydrographics Ranges
Hydrographics Percentage Range
0 0%–5%
1 6%–15%
2 16%–25%
3 26%–35%
4 36%–45%
5 46%–55%
6 56%–65%
7 66%–75%
8 76%–85%
9 86%–95%
A (10) 96%–100%

Hot temperature DM-2
Boiling temperature DM-6

Note that these temperature-related DMs are ignored
for very dense (D) or the panthalassic subtype (7) of
unusual (F) atmospheres.

To determine a more precise value for hydrographics,
use a linear variation. For most ranges, this involves
adding a d10 roll to the lowest value of the range.
For the extreme ranges, to simulate the greater
chances of results of ‘all’ or ‘nothing’ the Referee
should still use a d10, with Hydrographics 0 rolled
as -4 + d10 and results below 0 treated as 0%. For
Hydrographics A, the Referee can use as 96 + d10
with results above 100% treated as 100%, with
worlds above Size code 9 with Hydrographics code A
always treated as 100% liquid.

Precision beyond 1% or at most 0.1% is not necessary,
as temporary conditions may cause variation in surface
coverage. By convention, for worlds with environmental
conditions suitable for liquid water on at least some
of the surface, permanently ice-covered land is
not considered part of the Hydrographics code or
percent statistic but permanently ice-covered water is
considered in these numbers.

world physical characteristics



OUTER SYSTEM HYDROGRAPHICS


On worlds where liquid water is not supported by
atmospheric conditions (or lack of atmosphere)
the Hydrographics code is considered to be the
fraction of the surface covered with ice. Still,
for worlds with vacuum or trace atmospheres,
beginning with only Atmosphere code 0 or 1,
adding 2D-7 and then applying a DM-4 to this roll
rarely creates any ice capped worlds and results
in very little ice on those few that manage a
non-zero Hydrographics code. Depending on the
definition of ‘ice capped’ and the composition of
outer system worlds – which might be half ice by
mass – this number can seem arbitrary. This can
be addressed in one of two ways:

Method 1: No change. Leave the hydrographics
generation process alone and consider the result (at most 1 or 2) as fields of pure or near pure
water ice, as opposed to mixtures of water ice
and other frozen gases or rocks.

Method 2: Treat the Hydrographics code as
more representative of the make-up of the
surface. In this method, remove the DM-4
for Atmospheres 0 and 1 and even allow
hydrographics rolls for worlds of Size 1 or even S
in regions beyond HZCO+3. On worlds in the 2.1

- 3.0 range beyond the HZCO, just use a DM-2
instead of DM-4 and still allow rolls for Size 1.

SURFACE FEATURE DISTRIBUTION


Worlds with Hydrographics codes of 6 or more tend
to be dominated by oceans, often an interconnected
‘world ocean’ as on Terra, and have individual
continents and islands separated by water. Worlds
with Hydrographics codes of 4 or less tend to be
dominated by land, often an interconnected world-spanning landmass, with isolated oceans and seas
with perhaps differing ‘sea levels’ despite them
being connected by river systems. A world with
a Hydrographics code of 5 could trend in either
direction, depending on the concentration and
morphology of continents.

These are not absolutes. A world with many water-filled
craters or depressions could have a Hydrographics
code of 6 or 7 and yet still have a single landmass and
many unconnected sea or ocean basins. To determine
the extent to which the dominant surface feature (land or water) is distributed, roll 2D-2 on the Surface
Distribution table. The definition of ‘body’ depends on
the Hydrographics code of the world.

If Hydrographics is 6+, the foundational geography is a
world ocean and the bodies are continents (major and
minor) and islands (small).

If Hydrographics is 4-, the foundational geography is
land or a world continent and the bodies are oceans (major and minor) and seas (small).

If the world’s Hydrographics code is an unrefined 5 and/
or the percentage of hydrographics is exactly 50%, roll
1D and assume the fundamental geography is ocean
on a 1–3, or land on a 4–6.

Surface Distribution
2D-2 Description Effect
0 Extremely Dispersed Many minor and small bodies: no major bodies
1 Very Dispersed Mostly minor bodies: 5–10% of the surface coverage is in major bodies
2 Dispersed Mostly minor bodies: 10–20% of the surface coverage is in major bodies
3 Scattered Roughly 20–30% or less of the surface coverage is in major bodies
4 Slightly Scattered Roughly 30–40% or less of the surface coverage is in major bodies
5 Mixed Mix of major and minor bodies: roughly 40–60% of body coverage is major
6 Slightly Skewed Roughly 60–70% of surface coverage is in major bodies
7 Skewed Roughly 70–80% of surface coverage is in major bodies
8 Concentrated Mostly major bodies: 80–90% of the surface coverage is in major bodies
9 Very Concentrated Single very large major body: 90–95% of body coverage is in one body
A Extremely
Concentrated

Single very large major body: 95% or more of body coverage is in one body

world physical characteristics

Optionally, the Referee could choose to allow
unexpected distributions (land versus water) by
allowing this roll when the Hydrographics code is not
5 and applying DMs based on the deviation from 5,
e.g., for a Hydrographics 4 world, the fundamental
geography is ocean on a result of 1–2 and land on 3–6.

A major body covers 5% or more of the planet’s
surface, a minor body 1–5% and a small body less
than 1%. The actual number of bodies depends on
the overall Hydrographics code. In cases where
a high or low Hydrographics code prevents the
formation of any major bodies, treat references to
major as minor and minor as small in the Surface
Distribution table effect column.

Actual numbers of continents should be determined
by the Referee based on the results of the Surface
Distribution table and the Hydrographics code or
percentage and the size parameters for various bodies
as illustrated in the following example:

Zed Prime has a Hydrographics code of 6. Adding a
d10 roll of 6 to the bottom of the range results in 62%
of the surface covered by water. This world likely has
oceans with continents in them but the Referee wants
to explore the chance that a contiguous landmass
covers the world. The Referee rolls 1D with a DM-1
since the Hydrographics is 6, and gets a 4-1 = 3, which
still leaves oceans as dominant.

WHAT IS A CONTINENT?
On Terra, land is split into sometimes arbitrarily
divided continents; most people would say
seven, some as few as four. A world’s total
surface area is proportional to the square root
of its diameter – in fact it is pi (π) times the
diameter in kilometres squared. For Terra this
value is about 510 million square kilometres.
The largest conglomeration of land masses,
Africa-Asia-Europe, is about 85 million square
kilometres or 16.6% (one sixth) of the world’s
surface. The smallest continent, Australia, is
7.7 million square kilometres or 1.5% of the
world’s surface. Greenland, Terra’s largest
non-continental landmass is 2.17 million square
kilometres or about 0.42% of the surface area.
The purpose of this diversion is to illustrate that
a ‘continent’ can exist perhaps even on a world
with a Hydrographics code ofA (10) if even just
1–2% of the surface is concentrated in a single
landmass. Since Size affects surface area,
determination of ‘continent’ status will depend
on the percentage of surface area covered, not
actual square kilometres. For this purpose, any
landmass covering 5% or more of the surface
is a major continent and anything covering
between 1% and 5% is a minor continent. A
similar distinction applies to major and minor
oceans. Bodies of land or water of less than 1%
size are considered islands or seas. On a Size
3 world, a 5% coverage major continent would
only be one-ninth the surface area of a 5% major
continent on a Size 9 world and it would not even
be considered a continent by area measurement
on the larger world, but for its world, it is still
considered a major continent.

If using a standard world map 35 hexes
across, about five hexes equals 1% of a
world’s surface area.

Next, a roll of 5 on the Surface Distribution table
indicates a mix of continent sizes. With 100-62 =
38% of the surface covered by land, half, or about
19%, of that land is tied up in major continents and a
similar percent in minor ones. With a minimum major
continent size defined as 5%, there cannot be more
than three major continents, so arbitrarily rolling D3
results in two major continents. The number of minor
continents could number from as low as four, if they

world physical characteristics



were all just below the major threshold (unlikely),
to 19, if they were all just above the threshold (also
unlikely). If they were about 3%, there would be about
6.3 minor continents. Given this distribution, the
Referee decides to roll 3D-3 for the number of minor
continents, conceding that a low result might require a
re-roll and receives 12-3 = 9 minor continents.

OPTIONAL RULE: EXOTIC LIQUIDS
The standard procedure for determining hydrographics
percentage for Hydrographics codes of exotic,
corrosive, or insidious Atmospheres (A–C) is to apply
a DM-4 to the roll. Instead, the Referee could choose
to use the equivalent density atmosphere of the
subtype (pages 92 to 93) as a baseline for the 2D-7 +
Atmosphere roll (for example a standard density exotic
atmosphere would use 6, not 10 for the atmosphere
factor to add). In such instances, the Referee can keep
the DM-4 for A+ types and a DM for hot (-2) or boiling (-6) temperatures, if appropriate. This will statistically
lead to less liquids on Atmosphere A–C worlds.

Even on worlds with exotic atmospheres, water is a
possible source of the world’s liquid surface area if
temperatures allow for it. For much of Terra’s early
history, it would have been considered Atmosphere A
but its liquid surface would still be composed of water.

On worlds with corrosive or insidious atmosphere
types, the liquid is less likely to be water but its
composition depends greatly on the final surface
temperature of the world. Consult the Atmospheric Gas
Composition table on page 87 and select from those
‘gases’ in between their melting point and boiling point
at the mean temperature at the world’s surface.

If using the surface temperature calculations beginning
on page 108, the results of those calculations could
influence the choice of liquid material. The listed
melting and boiling points assume an environment with
a standard atmospheric pressure (1.013 bar) and may
vary greatly under different conditions but checking
on the properties of each gas under varying pressure
conditions is an exercise for an ambitious world
designer or chemist and outside the scope of this book.

If the surface temperature exceeds 1,000K, it is
possible that the liquid on a surface is actually magma,
or liquid rock.

The best candidates for surface liquids are molecules
with a broader range of temperatures between their
melting and boiling points. The molecules with at least
20° difference are listed in the Possible Exotic Liquids (Fluidic Worlds) table in order of their boiling point.

world physical characteristics

The actual fluid for a particular Atmosphere code and
subtype should bear some resemblance to the gas mix,
with sulphur, fluorine and chlorine compounds potentially
present in atmospheres also containing these elements
as part of the atmosphere or as a taint or irritant
component. The other liquids, based on hydrogen,
carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, have elements likely to
be present in a variety of atmospheres. For worlds in
the proper temperature range, water remains the most
likely hydrographic liquid, although other exotic liquids
may be present as well. Under some conditions, such
as higher pressures or briny conditions, water’s range of
liquid temperatures could exceed those listed in either
direction. The same could be true for other liquids; this is
something for a chemist to explore.

Near the boiling point of a liquid, it may be present as
both an atmospheric gas and as a liquid. Titan is an
example of such a world, although the actual percentage
of its liquid surface that is methane is not well
determined. Even Terra has a varying percentage (over
1% in many cases) of water vapour in its atmosphere.

**HYDROGRAPHICS PROFILE**
Whether the liquid filling a world’s seas is water or
nitrogen, or possibly a combination of liquids, the
fluid(s) and amount(s) can be written in the format:

**_H-D:%%:XX-##:YY-##_**

Where H = Hydrographics Code, D = the surface
distribution, %% is the actual hydrographic
percentage, XX and YY is the chemical formula for
the liquid and ## is a percentage of a mixture (if
needed or determined). For instance, Terra would be
7:4:71:H 2 O, with no numbers since it is all water and
Titan would be 0:8:02:CH 4 :C 2 H 6 , with a distribution of
8 to account for the polar-only nature of its lakes and
with no numbers as the mixture is not known and may
vary. If the only significant liquid component is water,
the notation H 2 O is often omitted.

The two examples from the Zed system Aab I, a very
hot (above 500K) corrosive atmosphere world and
Cab II, a very cold (70-100K) exotic atmosphere are
candidates for non-water liquids, if they have any.

Aab I’s hydrographics roll is 7-7 + 11(for Atmosphere
code B – as it is ‘extremely dense, the subtype will
not change its code factor) - 10(-4 for Atmosphere
_code B and -6 for boiling) equals 1. The fluid needs_
to have a boiling point of more than 500K and that
makes sulphuric acid (H 2 SO 4 ) the likely choice,
ajthough the Referee may want to allow for ‘polar’

or high altitude seas of formamide (CH 3 NO) instead,
given the CO 2 and NH 3 atmosphere.

Cab II hydrographics roll is 6-7 +7 (for Atmosphere
code A but using subtype 7 as the base) – 4(for
Atmosphere A) equals 2. The fluid needs to be liquid
between 70 and 100K on a world with a predominantly
nitrogen atmosphere. The choices are fluorine,
oxygen, methane and ethane. The Referee could
roll, assigning some probability to each (a low one
for fluorine) but instead decides to make the seas full
of liquid oxygen – just add heat and the world could
become habitable (if tainted).

ROTATION PERIOD (DAY LENGTH)
The length of a world’s day is an important detail, not
just for flavour but for temperature and climate reasons.
The rotation period of a world can vary greatly, from
just a few hours to years-long, with possible tidal
factors (see page 105) contributing to prolonged or
even permanent daylight. There are no easy formulas
for determining this latter condition, known as tidal
lock, where one face of the world permanently faces
its primary. None of the planets in the Solar System
experiences actual tidal lock – although Mercury and
Venus have day lengths that are certainly influenced
heavily by the sun’s tidal forces. All of the significant
moons of the Solar System experience tidal lock – the
largest moon to avoid lock is Saturn’s moon Phoebe, a
likely captured outer system object orbiting more than
100 planetary diameters from its parent body.

BASIC DAY LENGTH


If no external factors, such as stars, planets or moons
have significant impact on a world’s spin rate, the
rotation period in hours is determined as:

Basic Rotation Rate (hours) =
(2D-2) x 4* +2 +1D + DMs
*For gas giant or small body (Size 0 or S) rotation,
multiply by 2 instead

System age DM+1 per 2 Gyrs (round down)

This yields a range of 3–48+ hours. If the result of
this roll is 40 or greater, then roll 1D: on a 5+, add the
results of another determination of basic rotation rate
and then roll 1D again: on a further roll of 5+, roll for
another addition of the basic rotation rate and so on.

To add greater precision to the length of the day,
consider the hour value as a base value and add
0–59 minutes and 0–59 seconds. This can be

world physical characteristics



emulated by rolling 1D-1 for the ‘tens’ digit and d10
for the ‘ones’ digit.

For Zed Prime, a roll for base rotation rate with DM+3
for system age results in (11-2) × 4 + 2 + 1 + 3= 42
hours, which requires a second roll, a 4, so no addition
is required. For extra accuracy, additional rolls result
in 42 hours, 22 minutes and 15 seconds, or in decimal
form, 42.37 hours.

DAYS IN A YEAR AND SOLAR DAYS


A day as determined above is one rotation, the period
of time required for a world to spin once on its axis.
This is called its sidereal day. While the world rotates,
it also revolves around its parent body. If it is a planet,
the time between ‘noons’, with the parent star(s) in
the same location in the sky, is called a solar day. For
Terra, a solar day is exactly 24 hours (on average) but
a sidereal day is slightly shorter: 23 hours, 56 minutes
and 4 seconds. This is not much of a difference but on
a world with a very slow rotation or one that is locked
with one face to its primary, the difference becomes
much larger. In the case of the locked planet, its
sidereal day is equal to the length of its year but its
solar day is infinite: the sun never moves (well, maybe
a little, but not all the way across the sky).

The number of solar days in a year is equal to the
length of the local year (in hours – use 8,766 hours for
one standard year) divided by the length of the sidereal
day (in hours) minus 1 and the length of the solar day is
equal to the number of hours in the year divided by the
number of solar days in the local year.

**_Solar Days in a local year =_** - 1

**_Solar Days (hours) =_**

Notice that if the length of the year and sidereal day are
the same, there are zero solar days in a year and the
length of the solar day is undefined or infinite (divide by 0
error). For slowly rotating worlds, the disparity in sidereal
and solar day lengths can be rather large and for worlds
with an axial tilt of greater than 90°, they rotate retrograde,
or ‘backwards’, and their sidereal day should be treated
as a negative number, leading to even greater disparities.
It is the length of the solar day that matters for determining
the climatic effects from temperature swings but it is the
length of the sidereal day that impacts such things as the
Coriolis effect of weather patterns.

For Zed Prime, the extra level of complexity is
that it is a moon. Its sidereal day is 42.37 hours
but since the sun is the source of heat, not its gas
giant primary, the length of the gas giant’s year is
considered instead. This is not necessarily a perfect
calculation but close enough: Using 0.805 years ×
8,766 = 7,056.63 hours for the year, divided by 42.37
minus 1 equals 165.548 days in a year and the solar
day becomes 7,056.63 ÷ 165.548 = 42.626 hours or
42 hours, 37 minutes and 33 seconds.

AXIAL TILTS


The axial tilt of a world, also known as its obliquity, is
the angle between its rotational axis and its orbital axis
or the plane in which it orbits its sun or parent body.
The axial tilt of a world influences the severity of a
world’s seasons and its resistance to becoming tidally
locked to its parent body. To determine axial tilt:

Axial Tilt
2D Tilt Range
2–4 (1D-1) ÷ 50 0.00–0.10°
5 (1D) ÷ 5 0.2–1.2°
6 1D 1–6°
7 6 + 1D 7–12°
8–9 5 + 1D × 5 10–35°
10+ Roll on the Extreme Axial Tilt
table

Extreme Axial Tilt
1D Tilt Range Remarks
1–2 10 + 1D × 10 20–70° High axial tilt
3 30 + 1D × 10 40–90° Extreme axial tilt
4 90 + 1D × 1D 91–126° Retrograde
rotation
5 180 - 1D × 1D 144–180° Extreme
retrograde
6 120 +1D × 10 130–180° Extreme
retrograde with
high variance

Linear variance for axial tilt values is appropriate and
should be additive (using the result as a base) on the
Extreme Axial Tilt table. Since sub-divisions of degrees
are expressed as minutes and seconds, they can be
added using the same procedures as day length variation.

Retrograde rotation is any rotation between 90°
and 180°. It means the planet spins in the direction
opposite to that of its revolution around its primary – by

world physical characteristics

Years(hours)
Sideral Day(hours)

Years(hours)
Solar Days in a local year

convention a counter-clockwise or ‘right-hand’ direction
is the default. Tilts of greater than 90° can also be
expressed as 180° minus its tilt with the day considered
negative. An axial tilt can never exceed 180°; any
excess created by adding variation or multiple extreme
rolls should be subtracted from 180 instead. An axial tilt
of 90° places a world on its side, with the pole facing its
parent body; from a climatic impact, such an orientation
effectively leads to one whole hemisphere experiencing
sunlight for half a year, just as at Terra’s poles.

A world’s axial tilt is a provisional value. A tidal lock (see
below) could change the tilt if that is indicated.

For Zed Prime, a roll of 10 leads to the Extreme Axial
Tilt table. A 1D roll on that table is a 3, resulting in an
_axial tilt of 70° further refined to 73° 39’ (the ‘ notation_
denotes minutes of arc, a ” would denote seconds) or
73.65°. Note this tilt is in relation to the primary, a gas
giant, which may also have a tilt (and Zed Prime’s orbit
could have an inclination, further complicating things).
In this case, the tilt of the gas giant is 3° 45’ (3.75°) and
the moon’s orbit is assumed to be in the plane of the
gas giant’s equator.

**DETERMINING TIDAL IMPACTS**
Tides are differential forces applied to the planet
across the breadth of its diameter by potentially both
parent and child objects. They can impact the length

of day and even cause a tidal lock where the same
face of a world always faces the body. Tidal forces
also impact the magnitude of tides on a world’s
shorelines and can cause seismic stress, increasing
volcanic and other geologic activity. The tidal force
relationship can be explained thus: tidal force is
directly related to the mass of the other body and the
diameter of the affected body and inversely related to
the cube of the distance between them.

**_Tidal Force ~_**

The following sections will use this basic relationship (without as much mathematics) to determine how a
world is affected by tidal force.

TIDAL LOCK EFFECT


A strong tidal force can cause a world to stop
independent rotation and keep one face toward that
body, rotating once per revolution. This can lock a
planet to a star, a moon to its planet, or even a planet
to its moon. Other factors may prevent a lock from
occurring, such as a high axial tilt, a large orbital
eccentricity, the presence and movements of other
gravitational sources, or even a thick atmosphere. To

*Even on a result of a 1:1 lock, a random condition such as an impact or nearby passage of a large object may have
broken the tidal lock. Roll 2D, on a natural 12, roll again on the Tidal Lock Status table with no DMs. For the case of a
moon locked to a planet only, if the resultant day length for a moon is greater than the period of its orbit around its parent
planet, it remains in a 1:1 tidal lock.

†On either a 3:2 or 1:1 tidal lock, If a world’s axial tilt is more than 3°, reroll the world’s axial tilt as (2D-2) ÷ 10 degrees.
For a 1:1 lock only, if the world’s eccentricity is more than 0.1, reroll the world’s eccentricity with DM-2 and use the lower
of the original or new values.

account for these many factors, the tidal lock status of
a world is the result of one or more rolls on the Tidal
Lock Status table.

This table determines tidal locks for three cases: the
lock of a planet to a sun, the lock of a moon to a planet
and the lock of a planet to a moon. Where multiple
checks are possible for the same body or pair of
bodies, such as a world with a Close moon and a Near
star, only roll for the case with the highest DM. In the
case of a tie, roll for a lock to a moon first (the closest
moon if there are more than one) and if a lock condition
does not occur, roll for a lock to the star (or the next
moon and then the star if there are multiple possible
moons with the same DM) and apply the effect of
highest adjusted roll to the world.

This table has many DMs, some common to all cases,
some to the specific case. All relevant DMs, common
and specific apply to roll for the relevant case. The
result applies to the world’s sidereal day and assumes
that this value was determined using the procedure in
the Basic Day Length section on page 103.

TIDAL LOCK DMS


The following DMs apply to the Tidal Lock Status table (each case has a Base DM). In ‘edge’ conditions where
a value corresponds to more than one DM or falls

If total DMs for any case are -10 or less, there is no
need to roll on the Tidal Lock Status table for that case.
If the total DMs for case are +10 or more, then a 1:1
lock is automatic (except on a further roll of 12 on 2D).

**EFFECTS OF TIDAL LOCK:**
A world that is tidally locked to a star has no defined
solar day and has a rotation rate (sidereal day) equal
to its period or year length. It is also referred to as a
twilight zone world, with one side in constant sunlight,
the other in constant dark, separated by a narrow
region called the twilight zone.

If a moon is locked to a planet, or a planet to its moon,
it is still tidally locked but it is not a twilight zone world:
the length of the sidereal day of the locked body is equal
to the period of the moon, which may considerably
lengthen the day but the solar day is still computed,
based on this new sidereal day length, as normal.

An additional effect of a tidal lock is a change or
reduction of the locked body’s axial tilt. This tilt is
often close to the plane of its orbit, meaning in a
simplified two-dimensional system representation
with no orbital inclination considered, it is close to
zero with regards to the sun(s).

A full lock can also reduce eccentricity as indicated above.

To summarise, a tidal lock has the following effects:

1. For planets locked to stars, sidereal day equals period
    (year), solar day is undefined (twilight zone world).
       2. For moons locked to a planet, or a planet to its
          moon, sidereal day equals moon’s period.
       3. For a 1:1 lock, recompute the axial tilt by rolling 1D
          on the Axial Tilt table (page 104) to determine the
          new axial tilt.
       4. For a 1:1 lock, recompute the world’s eccentricity
          with DM-2 if it is greater than 0.1 and use the lower
          of the original or new values.

Zed Prime is a moon in orbit around a gas giant. The
gas giant has a mass of 1,200 and Zed Prime is a Size 5
world that orbits retrograde at 22 PD with an eccentricity
of 0.25. The system age is 6.3 billion years. The
resultant DM for all cases is +2 (Size), -2 (eccentricity),
-2 (tilt greater than 30°), -4 (tilt between 60° and 120°),
and +2 (system age) or a global -4 DM for all cases.
DMs for a moon locked to a planet are +6 (Base), -1 (planetary diameters), -2 (retrograde), +8 (planet mass),
or DM+11 in this case. Adding all DMs together results
in a total DM of +7. Rolling 2D gets a 6 + 7 = 13, which
is a 1:1 lock. Buta (fudged by Referee) further roll of 12
results in a ‘DM free’ roll on the Tidal Lock Status table
and that result is a 4 which doubles the sidereal day
length to 84 hours, 44 minutes and 30 seconds, or in
decimal form, 84.74 hours. The number of days in a year
becomes 82.2739 and the solar day is now 85.77 hours,
or 85 hours, 46 minutes and 12 seconds.

SURFACE TIDAL EFFECTS


One ironic effect of a tidal lock is that the daily effects
associated with ‘tides’ between the two bodies no
longer directly affects the locked world. A world locked
to its sun does not experience the daily changes in
sea level associated with tides on Terra but it is the
long-time consequence of those daily tides that slowed
the world’s rotation and locked it so one hemisphere
always faces its primary. The same is true for a planet
locked to its moon, although a third body can still
raise tides on both. The tidal force experienced by
a world from a body to which it is not locked can be
determined, although it will require translating Orbit#s
into AU for planets and planetary diameters into
kilometres for moons but planet sizes remains as the
Size, not kilometres. A star’s influence in metres of tidal
amplitude on the average ocean tides of a planet is:

**_Star Tidal Effect =_**

For comparison, Sol causes a tidal amplitude effect
of 0.25 metres on Terra’s oceans. The force of a
star’s tides also applies to the moons of a planet

world physical characteristics

Star Mass x Planet Size
32 x AU^3



even when those moons are tidally locked to their
parent planet – substitute the moon’s Size for the
planet’s Size in the equation above.

The tidal effect of a moon, locked or not, on a planet
which is not locked to that moon is computed using the
moon’s distance from the planet in millions of kilometres:

**_Moon Tidal Effect =_**

For comparison, Luna causes a tidal effect of 0.54
metres on Terra’s oceans.

In cases where a moon is not tidally locked to its
parent, the parent planet causes tides on the moon:

**_Planet Tidal Effect =_**

Finally, around planets with multiple large moons, these
moons can apply tidal pressures on each other. This
force affects moons even when both are tidally locked.
The force varies as moons orbit the planet, being
strongest when the moon separation is equal to the
differences between their orbital distances to the planet
and weakest when the moon separation is equal to the
total of their orbit distances from the planet:

**_Moon to Moon Tidal Effect =_**

This effect will wax and wane as the separation between
the two bodies varies. Technically, this calculation could
be done between all moon pairs but it should only be
done at all if the Referee thinks it is important.

For all of these cases, the tidal effect in metres
represents a near minimum amplitude value, what
could be expected in the open ocean. On Terra,
coastal features often channel tidal effects, causing

a rise in tides of as much as 16 times the value
computed in the above equations. On worlds with
multiple tidal effects interacting, tides can become
chaotic as the interaction between different forces
and delays caused by terrain features scramble
timetables from the expected two high and two low
tides a day from each tide-producing body into what
seems like a random fluctuation that might on rare
occasions all combine to create extremely high or
low ‘rogue tides’.

With a little fudging, Zed Prime manages without a
tidal lock but is still subject to the tides of its primary
planet, a large gas giant (mass 1,200⊕). Its orbital
distance is 3.9424 million kilometres, resulting in a
tidal force of 1,200 × 5 ÷ (3.2 × 3.9424^3 ) or 30.599
rounded to 30.6 metres minimum effect. Tides of
100 metres or more may impact the shores of this
world at long intervals during its slow day. With this
monstrous tidal effect in play, there is little need to
worry about effects from other moons. The effect
from the two relatively distant suns is only 1.836 ×
5 ÷( 32 × 1.06^3 ) or 0.24 metres, which is about the
same as the effect of Sol and Terra and hardly worth
mentioning for this world. Note that had Zed Prime
been locked to its primary, only this solar force, plus
any minor force from the only other substantially-sized moon would be in effect – but tidal heating (to
be covered later) from its eccentric orbit could remain
a large factor.

MEAN TEMPERATURE


Warning: This section is the most mathematics-heavy
of the book, though there will be tables to bypass
the need to calculate everything. A Referee could
spend an inordinate amount of time accounting for
complicated but essentially insignificant temperature
profiles. In most cases, the only temperature needed
for describing a world is the basic temperature, which
can be used as the mean temperature.

BASIC TEMPERATURE


The Referee does not need to do any temperature
calculations if all that is necessary is a vague idea of
the world’s general temperature: Is it hotter or colder
than Terra? For that determination, the modified
temperature roll from page 251 of the Traveller Core
Rulebook is sufficient. A modified value of 7 can be
assumed to be a mean temperature of 15°C or 288K.
The Basic Mean Temperature table provides a value
based on this modified roll.

the results.

**ADVANCED TEMPERATURE RULES OF THUMB**
If the Referee wishes to delve into temperature
calculations, several rules of thumb apply. Determining
global high and low temperatures and temperatures at
specific locations or times of the day could be interesting
in the course of an adventure, in many cases they can
be improvised values based on the base temperature
and certain straightforward rules of thumb:

Thumb rule one: The temperature of a world is
ultimately based on how much energy it receives from
its star(s), how much gets reflected and how much is
trapped. Sometimes inherent heat is generated by the
planet itself and added to other values.

Thumb rule two: Many of the conditions and equations
in this section lead to modifications of the Luminosity
factor in the temperature equation. The base or mean (not necessarily an arithmetical mean but a ‘normal’
value) for the world as a whole should always use a
factor of luminosity × 1.0. A high temperature should
never use a factor of more than luminosity × 1.999 and
a low no less than luminosity × 0.001. Atmospheric
conditions may compress these extreme limits closer
to 1.0 but never beyond those limits. Local factors can
exceed the high and low temperatures list under certain
conditions but not over the course of a full year.

Thumb rule three: The basic temperature equation
determines temperature in degrees Kelvin (K) and is
of the form:

**_Temperature (K) =_**

279 x

Thumb rule four: If a temperature factor is independent
from solar radiation (luminosity) and other variables
associated with the above temperature equation, it is
added to the resultant temperature(s) as a separate and
independent temperature using the fourth root of the
total of the fourth power of each factor:

**_Temperature Addtion Equation:Ttotal =_**

Rule five : All of the equations below except the
mean temperature are probably wrong, at least
under certain conditions. Climate scientists with
supercomputers do not always agree on models for
temperature effects and even when their models
agree, the results can be indeterminate.

With more thumbs than hands, the temperature
section commences:

MEAN TEMPERATURE DETERMINATION


Computing the mean temperature of a world by formula
requires four values:

1. The luminosity of its sun(s) (in Solar units)
2. The distance from its sun(s) (in AU)
3. The fraction of solar energy it reflects back into
    space (albedo)
4. The fraction of energy that the world’s atmosphere
    prevents from escaping (greenhouse factor)

world physical characteristics

Luminosityx (1 - Albedo)x (1 + Greenhouse Factor)

4 4



The first and second values are determined in previous
chapters. For the mean temperature, if a world orbits
multiple suns, the luminosity of all of those ‘interior’ stars
is added to determine luminosity and any ‘exterior’ stars
are initially ignored. If a world is a moon, use the Orbit# of
the world’s parent planet to determine the AU distance.

ALBEDO


The third value is the world’s albedo. More specifically
for temperature generation, these formulas consider
the Bond or bolometric albedo, which covers all
wavelengths of light. A world’s albedo can vary from
as little as 0.04 for the dark dusty surfaces of some
asteroids and cometary cores, to nearly 1.0 for bright
ice and clouds. An accepted value for Terra’s albedo
is about 0.3, for Luna about 0.11 and Mars 0.25 but
for brighter cloud-covered worlds, the numbers can be
higher: Venus is 0.75 and gas giants range between
0.3 and 0.5. Icy outer system bodies often have high
albedos, such as Enceladus at 0.81 and Eris at 0.96.

The Albedo Range table provides guidance for
determining the albedo of different types of worlds.
Select the proper type of world, then if the world has
atmosphere or hydrographics values add the results
from the appropriate modifier rows. On the table, a rocky
terrestrial world is considered any world with a density
greater than 0.4. The potential exception is a snowball
world with extreme glaciation, which should be treated
instead as an icy terrestrial beyond HZCO+2.

In the unlikely event of generating a result greater than
0.98 or less than 0.02, treat the albedo results as 0.02
and 0.98 respectively.

GREENHOUSE FACTOR


The fourth value for determining the base temperature
is the greenhouse factor. Vacuum worlds have a
greenhouse factor of 0 by definition. For worlds
with an atmosphere, many gases contribute to the
greenhouse factor, including atmospheric composition
and thickness. These do not always contribute in
a consistent manner, or at least they cannot be
considered in isolation. For instance, methane
is a greenhouse gas that is 40 times as potent
as carbon dioxide per molecule, but on Titan the
nitrogen-methane atmosphere actually has a reverse
greenhouse effect on the surface temperature. Rather
than attempting to model various gas interactions at
differing pressures and temperatures, the greenhouse
factor can be emulated using the following guidelines:

The initial greenhouse factor is equal to 0.5 times the
square root of the world’s atmospheric pressure in bar:

**_Initial Greenhouse Factor =_** 0.5 x

Next, apply the following modifiers to the factor:

Greenhouse Modifiers
Condition Modifier
Atmosphere 1–9 or D or E + 3D × 0.01
Atmosphere A or F × 1D-1 (minimum 0.5)
Atmosphere B, C, G, or H 1D: on 1–5, × the result (of 1–5); on 6, × 3D

Albedo Range
World Types Albedo Range Midpoint
Rocky terrestrial (Density above 0.5) 0.04 + (2D-2) × 0.02 0.04–0.22 0.14
Icy terrestrial, up to HZCO+2 0.2 + (2D-3) × 0.05 0.15–0.65 0.40
Icy terrestrial, beyond HZCO+2 0.25 + (2D-2) × 0.07* 0.25–0.95 0.73

*Icy worlds beyond two orbits from the habitable zone centre are likely to have significantly brighter surfaces but this can

world physical characteristicsvary widely. On any result of 0.4 or less, subtract 1D-1 × 0.05 from the albedo to lower the limit of 0.02.

bar

After modifications, this value is the world’s effective
greenhouse factor at mean baseline altitude. It
can be helpful to keep note of this modifier to the
initial factor for use in determining altitude-based
temperatures, although the modifier can also be
recomputed from a known final value and the initial
greenhouse factor formula.

With all four factors determined, the mean temperature
of a world in Kelvin (K) is:

**_Mean Temperature (K) =_**

279 x

This value can be rounded to the nearest whole
number. The Celsius equivalent is

**_Temperature Celsius (°C) =_** Temperature (K)-273

In many cases, this is the only temperature calculation
required for a world but it is a generic world-wide, year-long average number.

If Referees have a particular temperature range in
mind for their vision of the world, altering the values of
albedo or greenhouse factors is the best way to ‘fine-tune’ a world’s climate to meet those expectations.

**OPTIONAL RUNAWAY GREENHOUSE CHECK**
If using the optional runaway greenhouse check
procedure on page 79, the Referee should check for this
effect on any world with an initial Atmosphere of 2–F with
a mean temperature above 303K (30°C).

Zed Prime is a moon of a gas giant which orbits Zed Aa
and Ab. Those two stars have a combined luminosity
of 1.419 and the distance of Zed Prime’s gas giant
primary from those stars is 1.06 AU.

To determine Zed Prime’s albedo, it is a rocky terrestrial
with Atmosphere 6 and Hydrographics 6, resulting in
0.04 + 2D-2 × 0.02 + 2D × 0.01 + 2D-3 × 0.03 rolled as
0.04 + (8-2) × 0.02 + 8 × 0.01 + (6-3) × 0.03 = 0.33.

For greenhouse factor, Zed’s Atmosphere code 6
has a pressure of 1.04 bar. This yields a greenhouse
factor of 0.5 × 1.041/2+3D × 0.01 which, with a 3D roll
of 8 results in 0.59.

TEMPERATURE AND MOARN


The most important temperature value for a world
is its mean temperature – not necessarily an
arithmetic mean but an expected average-like
temperature over the period of a local year at
45° latitude at the world’s mean baseline altitude.
This can be computed using the Basic Mean
Temperature table or the temperature equation.

Additional temperature calculations can
become very complex, especially if dealing
with a situation as convoluted as Zed Prime: a
slowly rotating moon revolving in an eccentric
retrograde orbit around a gas giant in a quintuple
star system. Even the examples in the text will
not try to figure out all possible combinations
of temperature effects – that would require a
computer program or convoluted spreadsheet,
and some variations may not repeat over the
course of years or even decades.

Each of this section’s temperature-varying
calculations assumes different factors and if
needing anything beyond the mean temperature
to describe or further develop a world, the Referee
should focus on those most likely to have the
biggest impact: for seasonal effects, it would
normally be axial tilt.

Short term effects are less important for global
values. For instance, the 44-hour orbit at a
separation of 0.036AU for Zed Prime’s two
interior stars would yield varying results of +3K to
mean temperature just by computing each star’s
temperature contribution separately and treating
the orbit of the smaller star as varying by 0.036AU
distant from Zed Prime. While it may have some
impact, the effect is likely drowned out by random
weather conditions or other factors. An increase of
just three degrees might have profound impacts if
it is a long-term increase but in the short term it is
merely noise, unless relevant to how Travellers or
locals behave.

These four values entered into the mean temperature
equation results in: 279 × (1.419 × (1 - 0.33) × (1 +
0.59) ÷ 1.06^2 )1/4 = 300K. This is 12° warmer than Terra,
although averages will not give a complete picture.

HIGH AND LOW TEMPERATURES


A single mean temperature value does not describe the
ranges of temperatures experienced on a daily basis
across a world’s surface. Various scenarios can cover
deviations from the mean temperature. The first of these
will consider the values to record as High and Low
temperatures for the world. These are not the world’s
most extreme temperatures but are bounds on expected
temperature values under most circumstances.

A major factor in determining temperature variations
on many worlds is axial tilt. The effects of axial tilt
are moderated and exacerbated by other factors,
such as the length of days and years, the world’s
atmosphere and even its general geography. These
factors can modify the effective luminosity value of
the temperature equation over varying time periods
across the course of a planet’s year. The world’s
orbital eccentricity can also influence temperatures as
the world moves close and further from its suns. This
section will build these factors in steps to compute the
high and low temperature values.

STEP 1: AXIAL TILT FACTOR
The major influence on Terra’s annual temperature
variation at a particular time of year comes from axial
tilt, which causes the variation in temperature between
summer and winter. In simple terms, the tilt of the
world as it orbits its star is such that one hemisphere
receives more energy than another – it has a longer
day and the sun strikes at less of an angle. Locations

above the arctic circle, those of higher latitude than
90 degrees minus axial tilt degrees, will experience at
least some days of perpetual daylight in the summer
and night in the winter and the actual poles will
experience sunlight for half the year and night for the
rest. The following procedure will determine the axial
tilt factor for the world. The basic axial tilt factor is
equal to the sine of the axial tilt:

**_Basic Axial Tilt Factor =_** sin(axial tilt)

For the purposes of this calculation the axial tilt should
be considered to be in the range of 0–90°. If the
axial tilt is beyond this range, then treat it as positive
if negative and/or if it is more than 90°, subtract its
positive value from 180°.

Determining this factor can be done mathematically or
from a table. If computing tilt factors mathematically
there are some extra considerations:
•	 If the axial tilt is negative, this will result in a
negative number – take the absolute value of this
number instead.
•	 If using a calculator or spreadsheet, the function
SIN() assumes generally radians not degrees.
In these cases, first convert any arcminute or
arcsecond values to their decimal equivalent
and then multiply the tilt value by, which might
be easier to render as ‘π÷180’, or use the
RADIANS() function.
world physical characteristics

Rather than struggling with equations, the following
table provides the basic axial tilt factor in 5°
increments from 5° to 90°. Extrapolate to the nearest
degree if desired.

Basic Axial Tilt Factor

Axial Tilt Modifier Axial Tilt Modifier
5° 0.09 50° 0.77
10° 0.17 55° 0.82
15° 0.26 60° 0.87
20° 0.34 65° 0.91
25° 0.42 70° 0.94
30° 0.50 75° 0.97
35° 0.57 80° 0.98
40° 0.64 85° 1.00
45° 0.71 90° 1.00

Very short or long orbital periods can alter the
magnitude of this factor:
•	 If the length of a world’s year is less than 0.1
standard years (876.6 hours or 36.525 days) then
divide the axial tilt factor by two to represent the
dampening effect of short seasons.
•	 If the length of a world’s year is greater than 2.0
standard years, increase the axial tilt factor by 0.01
times the length of the year (in standard years) to a
maximum increase of 0.25 or to a maximum value
of 1.00, whichever is less.

Zed Prime sits nearly on its side. It has an axial tilt of
73.65°, which the Referee can ‘eyeball’ as an axial tilt
factor of 0.96 from the table or compute as 0.95956.
Since this tilt is around its gas giant planet and the
length of that revolution is only 26 days, the axial tilt
factor is halved to become 0.48 – note the axial tilt of
the parent planet could also be a contributor but as
_it is less than 4° in this case and could influence the_
tilt factor either positively or negatively, the Referee
decides not to worry about trying to add that extra
wheel of detail.

**STEP 2: ROTATION FACTOR**
Longer days and nights can contribute to greater
variation in temperature. While somewhat related to the
axial tilt, this factor can be considered independently. In
most cases the rotation factor is the square root of the
length of the absolute value of the solar day (see page
104) in hours, divided by 50:

**_Rotation Factor =_**

Two exceptions to this exist, both based on the
principle that no temperature modification factor to
luminosity can be greater than 1.0:
•	 Any solar day of greater than 2,500 hours results in
a rotation factor of 1.0
•	 All worlds in a 1:1 tidal lock to their sun(s) have a
rotation factor of 1.0

Zed Prime’s solar day is 85.77 hours long, so the
resulting rotation factor is determined by taking the
square root of that number and then dividing by 50
to get 0.185.

STEP 3: GEOGRAPHIC FACTOR
Liquid water has a moderating effect on temperature.
Conversely, locations far from large bodies of water
can experience greater extremes in temperature. To
account for this, apply a Geographic Factor based on
the world’s Hydrographics code (HYD) and results of
the Surface Distribution table on page 100:

**_Geographic Factor =_** + Modifier

If the world’s Hydrographics code is between 2–8, then
geography can modify the factor:

Surface Distribution is ‘Very Concentrated’ (9 +) +0.1
Surface Distribution is ‘Very Distributed’ (1-) -0.1

A modified result can result in a negative number.

STEP 4: VARIANCE FACTOR ADDITION
At different times and locations, the factors above
can combine in different ways to vary from the mean
temperature of a world. However, the initial use of
these factors is to help determine global high and
low temperature values. These are not the extremes
possible across a world’s surface but overall values
to determine expected variation. For this purpose, the
factors determined above can be added together:

Variance Factors = Axial Tilt Factor + Rotation Factor +
Geographic Factor

If this result is greater than 1.0, it must be reduced to
1.0; if it is less than 0, it becomes 0.

The variance factors for Zed Prime add up to 0.865.

STEP 5: ATMOSPHERIC FACTOR
Atmospheric circulation can dampen temperature
variations across a surface, even to the point of
eliminating any significant variances. The Atmospheric
Factor for a world is equal to 1 plus its atmospheric
pressure in bar:

**_Atmospheric Factor =_** 1 + Atmosphere in bar

Zed Prime has an atmospheric pressure of 1.04 bar, so
its atmospheric factor is 2.04

STEP 6: LUMINOSITY MODIFIER
The Luminosity Modifier is equal to the variance factors
divided by the atmospheric factor. It will be a number
somewhere between 1 and 0:

**_Luminosity Modifier =_**

If the variance factors remain within the bounds of 0
and 1, the luminosity modifier can never be more than
1 or less than 0.

Zed Prime’s luminosity modifier = 0.865 ÷ 2.04 = 0.424

STEP 7: HIGH AND LOW LUMINOSITY
A major element in the temperature equation used to
compute the world’s overall high and low temperatures
is set by applying the luminosity modifier to determine
the effective luminosity experienced by the world under
differing conditions. These modified values are:

High Luminosity =
Luminosity × (1 + Luminosity Modifier)
Low Luminosity =
Luminosity × (1 – Luminosity Modifier)

With total luminosity from Stars Aab at 1.419, Zed Prime’s
high and low luminosity values are 2.021 and 0.817.

STEP 8: ECCENTRICITY MODIFIERS: NEAR AND FAR AU
The final factor to consider in determining high and
low temperature values is the world’s eccentricity.
For a planet, the eccentricity of its orbit is the value
to consider and for a moon, it is the eccentricity of
the parent planet. The Referee could also compute

the difference in orbital location based on the moon’s
orbit for extra complexity but in the interest of sanity,
that is optional.

For the high temperature, the AU value of an orbit
should be multiplied by 1 – eccentricity to set a Near
AU value. For a low temperature by 1 + eccentricity to
set a Far AU value:

Near AU = AU × (1 - eccentricity)
Far AU = AU × (1 + eccentricity)

For Zed Prime, its parent planet’s orbit (of 1.06AU) is
what matters for eccentricity. Its eccentricity is 0.10,
so the Near AU value is 1.06 × (1 - 0.10) or 0.954 and
the Far AU value is 1.06 × (1 + 0.10) or 1.166. Zed
Prime’s orbit around its gas giant could add +3.9 million
kilometres to this value but that is less than the variance
of the planet’s eccentricity and the Referee feels no need
to try to determine any difference this could cause.

STEP 9: HIGH AND LOW TEMPERATURE CALCULATION
From the combination of the above luminosity
and distance modifiers, the world’s high and low
temperatures are:

**_High Temperature (K) =_**

279 x

**_Low Temperature (K) =_**

279 x

Using albedo = 0.33 and greenhouse factor = 0.59, with
the above computed factor values, Zed prime’s high
and low temperatures are 346K and 250K, respectively (73°C and -24°C). For comparison, the [[Terra|Terran]] values for
these two temperatures computed in the same manner
are 312K and 261K (38°C and -12°C).

ADDITIONAL TEMPERATURE SCENARIOS


The mean, high and low temperatures are planetwide
values valid at mean baseline altitude and temperate-zone regions. Changes to the luminosity modifier’s
components can provide different temperatures and
ranges for differing latitudes and times of year or day.

Differing altitudes are addressed by modifying the
greenhouse factor based on the varying atmospheric
pressures at different altitudes. These calculations can
become rather complex and rely on the interactions
between various factors that can both increase and
decrease the temperature values. If a Referee wants to
work out various scenarios and determine temperature
profiles for certain locations at different times, these
procedures and equations will provide some guidance.
They are intended to be tools to apply as necessary,
not requirements for any or every situation.

**TEMPERATURE SCENARIO:**

**TEMPERATURE BY SEASON**
The axial tilt factor sets bounds for global seasonal
variation but actual variance depends on the latitude
and the time of the year. If the axial tilt factor is

TEMPERATURE VARIANCES


If the Referee just wants to estimate worst
case temperatures for a world, they can set the
variance factors of a world equal to 1.0 and use
only half of a world’s atmospheric pressure to set
the atmospheric factor:

**_Worst Case Luminosity Modfier =_**

For Zed Prime, the worst case luminosity modifier
is 0.657. This results in worst case high and
low temperatures of 359K and 230K. To check
the model, for Terra the worst case luminosity
modifier is 0.67, resulting in temperatures of 330K
and 219K – this is not exactly the hottest and
coldest ever actually recorded of 330 and 184
but it is a perfect fit for the hot value. Terra’s cold
value occurred at an altitude of 3,400 metres in
the Antarctic winter – although even throwing in
an altitude temperature factor (see page 122)
to reduce the greenhouse effect at that altitude
only changes the low value to 211, so this model
is still not perfect. It will, however, provide some
direction to describing the extremes of a world.
To force a worst case cold model to match Terra’s
conditions, the worst case low temperature value
determined by the formula could be multiplied by
0.84 or 0.85 for simplicity.

significant (meaning the axial tilt factor divided by the
atmospheric factor is more than 0.05) the Referee
may wish to determine temperatures for the current
season or the current day of the year in the ‘warmer’
or ‘colder’ hemisphere.

The temperature for each season changes the axial
tilt factor from its maximum value in local summer, to
zero at the equinoxes and to the negative in winter,
but the change is not linear and it will lag as the
ground slowly heats and cools.

To model this effect, begin by calculating an adjusted
fractional year by assigning a time to the beginning
of the last local summer – the summer solstice (pick
the relevant hemisphere). Determine the passage of
time from that event then subtract the lesser of 0.1
standard years or 0.1 local years to account for lag in
temperature effects, then divide that value by the length
of the local year. The below calculation uses local solar
days throughout and is not relevant for solar tidally
locked or very slowly rotating worlds:

**_Adjusted Fractional Year =_**

Assuming a basically circular orbit around the star,
multiply this interval by 360 and use the cosine of that
value to determine the fraction of the axial tilt factor to
apply. This will result in a number between +1 and -1
to multiply by the axial tilt factor to use as a substitute
for the axial tilt factor when determining the luminosity
modifier (which, regardless of all factor values, must
still be between 0 and 1).

Seasonal Axial Tilt Factor =
cos(Adjusted Fractional Year x 360) x Axial Tilt Factor

TEMPERATURE SCENARIO:
MEAN TEMPERATURE BY LATITUDE


Another modification to the axial tilt factor can help
determine a temperature specific to a latitude between
0°–90°. For these procedures, convert an axial tilt that
is negative or above 90° to an appropriate equivalent
by treating negative tilts as positive and/or if it is more
than 90°, subtracting its positive value or equivalent
from 180°. The world’s axial tilt determines the borders
of three basic seasonal zone types:

1. The tropical zone, defined as a region of a world
    with a latitude of less than or equal to the axial
    tilt or equivalent. In this region, the sun is directly
    overhead at least part of the year.
2. At the other extreme are the two arctic zones,
    defined as the regions with a latitude of more
    than 90° minus the axial tilt or equivalent. In these
    regions, for at least part of the year, the sun is
    below the horizon for the length of the day.
3. The regions in between are the two temperate
    zones, where neither of the prior conditions exist.
    However, if the axial tilt is between 45° and 90°,
    there is no temperate zone and regions that are
    tropical during one time in the year are arctic at
    another time. Note tropical, arctic and temperate do
    not imply particular temperature ranges, just zones
    of relative variations of sunlight. For clarity, in the
    processes below, the term middle zone will be used
    instead of temperate zone.

Part A: Worlds with Axial Tilts of less than 45°
The mean temperature of a world is defined as the
mean temperature of the world at 45° latitudes. For
worlds with an axial tilt of less than 45°, average
temperatures over the course of the year can be
divided into two zones by latitude, the tropical zone
and everything else, both the middles and the arctics.
For each of these cases a latitude adjustment applies,
determined for each as:

CASE 1, TROPICAL ZONE: In the tropical zone,
an axial tilt is not a significant factor for differences
in temperature during the course of varying seasons;
tropical temperatures have little seasonal variation (from axial tilt, although a large eccentricity could
provide season-like effects). Year-long temperatures
remain essentially constant in the tropic zone
and calculations regarding them can ignore
any temperature by season calculation, instead
experiencing temperatures warmer than the world’s
mean all year long. This increase is related to the
difference between 45° and the axial tilt.

**_Tropical Zone Latitude Adjustment =_** sin(45°- axial tilt)

This provides the temperature adjustment for
a location in this zone. If estimating varying
temperatures during the course of the year in the
tropical zone, an axial tilt factor modifier is not applied
to the temperature equation.

CASE 2, MIDDLE AND ARCTIC ZONES: The
following provides a roughly accurate match of
temperatures above the tropical zone:

Middle and Arctic Zone Luminosity Adjustment =
sin(45°- latitiude)

This adjustment is independent of tilt but during
different seasons, the axial tilt factor will also apply to
daily temperature variance factors in this zone.

BOTH CASES: After determining a zone luminosity
adjustment, it is applied to the luminosity modifier:

**_Luminosity Modifier =_**

This luminosity modifier is used to determine the
mean annual temperature for a specific latitude. In the
tropical zone, this modifier replaces any axial tilt factor
to modify luminosity when calculating any temperature
for a specific latitude. For the rest of the world, it also
replaces the axial tilt factor when computing a mean
annual temperature for the latitude but to determine
temperatures at a specific time of the year, the zone’s
latitude adjustment it is added to the axial tilt factor for
that time period and any other factors before dividing
by the atmospheric factor to determine the mean
temperature at that time of the year.

The luminosity multiplier for latitude to use in
the temperature equation is equal to 1 plus the
luminosity modifier:

Latitude Luminosity =
Luminosity×(1+Luminosity Modifier)

This is then added to the temperature equation to
determine the mean temperature of a specific latitude (or latitude temperature):

**_Latitude Temperature (K) =_**

Part B: Worlds with Axial Tilts of 45° or more
If a world has an axial tilt of 45°or more, it has no
middle zones, and the tropical and arctic zones
meet or overlap. For these worlds, use the following
alternate procedure:

- Apply the middle and arctic zone case (Case 2) for
    the entire arctic zone (90° - axial tilt)
- The latitude luminosity adjustment for the
    remaining equatorial tropical zone is equal to the
    result of middle and arctic zone case calculation at
    the edge of the arctic zone (90° - axial tilt)

Determine the latitude luminosity and the latitude
temperature as above.

**TEMPERATURE SCENARIO:**

**TEMPERATURE BY TIME OF DAY**
Especially when a world has a long rotation period or
solar day, temperature can vary greatly between day
and night. If the rotation factor is significant (meaning
the rotation factor divided by the atmospheric
factor is more than 0.05), the Referee may wish
to determine temperatures for the time of day. For
worlds that are locked to their primary star(s), see
the Temperature Scenario: Twilight Zone Worlds
section beginning on page 120.

Outside the extreme case of a twilight zone world, the
Referee can determine the actual magnitude of the daily
variation during the course of the day by one of two
methods. The first, suitable for worlds with moderate or
low axial tilts, is to assume that day and night lengths are
fairly even, whereas the second adds the complexity for
varying day and night fractions by season.

METHOD 1, EVEN LENGTH DAYS: Much like a
seasonal variation, a temperature variation lags the
sun. It is coldest near dawn and does not reach full heat
until the afternoon. The actual lag in heating can vary in
both absolute and relative terms but for simplicity this
procedure assumes symmetry between day and night
temperature lags. This method assumes a starting point
of the day, using local dawn as hour zero. If there was no
lag in hot and cold temperatures, it would be coldest at
midnight and warmest at noon. Instead, estimate the lag
by adding 15% of the solar day length to the hours since
dawn time of day, then divide the sum by the total hours
in a solar day to determine the adjusted fractional day:

Adjusted Fractional Day = + 0.15

Multiply the interval by 360 and use the sine of that
value to determine the fraction of the rotation factor to
apply to the temperature equation. This will result in a
number between +1 and -1 to multiply by the previously
computed rotation factor to be used as a substitute
rotation factor when determining the luminosity modifier.

Hourly Rotation Factor =
sin(Adjusted Fractional Day x 360) x Rotation Factor

METHOD 2, UNEVEN LENGTH DAYS: When day
and night have unequal lengths, the calculation becomes
rather more complex. First, determine the fraction of the
whole solar day that is daytime (see Calculating Sunlight
Portion and Hours, page 118). During daylight, use the
following formula for adjusted fractional day:

**_Adjusted Fractional Day =_**

During the night, use the following formula for adjusted
fractional day:

**_Adjusted Fractional Day =_**

Both day and night will then use the same hourly
rotation factor equation as method 1.

CALCULATING SUNLIGHT PORTION AND HOURS


The length of a day at a certain time of the year
at a certain latitude requires math and a few
simplifying assumptions. This calculation assumes
no atmospheric refraction and no solar disk size –
for guidance on the effects of those factors see the
procedures for twilight zone worlds.

STEP 1: Calculate the solar declination, the angle
between a sun’s rays and the plane of the world’s
equator. This angle is equal to the axial tilt times the
cosine of 360 times the solar days since the winter
solstice (for the appropriate hemisphere), referred to
as the date, divided by solar days in the year:

**_Solar Declination =_** Axial Tilt x cos

STEP 2: Determine the solution to the sunrise
equation, the angular span of time between noon
and sunrise, by multiplying the tangent of the current
latitude by the tangent of the solar declination. The
solution is the cosine of the sunrise value:

**_cos(Sunrise) =_** tan(Latitude) x tan(Solar Declination)

•	 If the cos(sunrise) is greater than 1.0, that latitude
has no sunrise and zero sunlight hours.
•	 If it is less than -1.0, that latitude experiences
constant daylight and the entire day is sunlit.

•	 If it is between -1 and 1, determine the actual
angle by taking the arccosine of the cosine of
sunrise:

**_Sunrise Angle =_** arccos(cos(Sunrise) )

This is the angle from 0° degrees (the location of
the sun at noon) of the actual sunrise. A value of 90°
means day and night are of equal length, while a
larger number means a long day, until reaching 180°,
which means sunset also stretches backwards to
180° degrees from 0° and that daylight is constant.

STEP 3: For days with sunrises, the sunlight portion
of the day is:

**_Sunlight Portion =_**

And the actual number of hours of sunlight is:

**_Sunlight Hours =_**

STEP 4: Putting everything together, this sunlight
portion equation is valid on days when the sun rises
and sets:

**_Sunlight Portion =_**

HOW BIG IS THAT THING IN THE SKY?
As a descriptive tool, it can be useful to know how
large an object, a sun, moon or even another planet
looks to the Travellers. On Terra, both Sol and Luna
are about a half degree wide in the sky. Their similar
size is why eclipses happen and look as they do,and
it provides a baseline for comparison with objects
in the skies of other worlds. The angular size of an
object from the surface of the world is equal to the
diameter of object star divided by its distance. To
determine this, first covert all values into kilometres:

1 Stellar Diameter = 1.39 million kilometres
1 AU = 150 million kilometres
1 Planetary Diameter = Actual planetary
diameter in kilometres, or
its Size × 1,600 kilometres

From there, assuming the object is at the local
zenith or straight overhead:

**_Angual Size (degrees) =_**

For Sol from Terra’s surface, the angular size is
0.009267 radians, multiplied by = 0.53 degrees
or 31.858 arcminutes. The size will vary slightly
at different times of the year because of Terra’s
eccentricity. For an object at the horizon – and
this is important for twilight zone calculations – the
world diameter is treated as 0. This shows an
object is actually slightly smaller (more distant)
on the horizon than overhead, despite what
atmospheric distortions and brains might imply. For
Sol on the horizon, the difference would result in an
angular size of 31.856 arcminutes, so at AU-scale
distance, the diameter of the world is unimportant
to the calculation. It matters more for closer objects
such as a moon or a station or ship in low orbit.

Luna’s angular size is 0.00919 radians from
Terra’s surface, also 0.53 degrees but more
precisely 31.592 arcminutes, slightly smaller
than the solar average size. Other factors, not
only eccentricity of both Luna and Terra’s orbits
but also where on the surface of the world the
Travellers are standing, are what make Luna’s
eclipses of Sol both possible and rare.

HOW BRIGHT IS THAT THING IN THE SKY?
A world’s sun, possibly other stars in the system,
moons and maybe planets, might be visible in
the daytime or night-time sky. This brightness is
usually expressed in terms of apparent magnitude.
Common reference points include:

Apparent Magnitude
Reference Point Magnitude
Sol from Terra -26.74
Object painful (and dangerous) to
look at

-25.00

Luna from Terra (full moon,
average distance)

-12.74

Venus from Terra at brightest -4.92
Limit of visible object in daylight (on Terra)

-4.00

Sirius (brightest star) from Sol -1.47
Limit of normal human vision +6.00
Limit of perfect human eyes in
perfect conditions

+6.50

To determine the brightness of a star in the sky (ignoring any atmospheric dimness) the formula is:

**_Star Apparent Magnitude =_**

- 26.74-2.5 x log 10 ( )

Where the luminosity of the star is expressed
in solar units and AU is the distance in AUs
between the observer and the star.

Planets and moons shine by reflected light and
are more complicated. The procedure below
will estimate the maximum brightness for a ‘full’
planet or moon under the illumination of a single
star. More complicated calculations are left as an
exercise for the Referee.

First, determine the intrinsic brightness of the
object. This assumes all the luminosity of a star
encompasses a sphere the size of the object’s
orbit – or its distance from the star – and the
object is a two-dimensional disk on that sphere.

TEMPERATURE SCENARIO: TWILIGHT ZONE WORLDS
In the extreme case of a world locked to its primary
star(s), which has an infinite solar day, the rotation
factor calculation is rather straightforward at the
edge cases:

Bright Side Rotation Factor = +1.0
Dark Side Rotation Factor = -1.0

The twilight zone has a Rotation Factor of about 0.0.
However, the twilight zone is a ‘zone’, not just a terminator
line separating light from dark, especially on worlds with
atmospheres. If the Referee wishes to determine variable
effects based on world-specific factors, the Referee can
determine how far from this terminator centreline the
extreme rotation factors take hold.

TWILIGHT ZONES VARIABILITY FACTORS


A number of factors impact the breadth and
characteristics of a twilight zone, including terrain,
libration, solar disk size, atmospheric refraction and the
effects of a twilit sky itself.

(Continued)
Here, the radius is that of the object in kilometres

- either half the objects’ diameter, or the object’s
Size × 800, and the distance is also in kilometres (AU × 150,000,000). Albedo is the object’s
albedo as determined from page 110.

With that object’s luminosity determined, the
actual apparent magnitude can use the star
apparent magnitude equation above, with any
distance in kilometres (usually for moons) first
converted to AU.

Actual brightness will be somewhat dimmer than
the computed magnitude number, depending
on object phase – which would affect the cross
sectional ‘area’ of the object in the object
luminosity equation – and other more esoteric
factors. If multiple stars shine on the object, each
contributes to the object’s overall luminosity,
also potentially subject to varying phases. And,
as an exercise for the Referee, an object may
be visible from ‘planet-shine’, e.g., a new moon
under ‘Earthshine’ is magnitude -3.69 (but really
not visible at that point, since it would be near
the sun, during the day).

Terrain: An effect on all worlds is the actual terrain
and altitude of intervening geography. This can both
block and extend sunlight at the twilight zone. Many
factors can influence the ‘contours’ of the terminator
but the simplest case to consider is that of the distance
to the horizon, as taller objects can see ‘further’ into
the day side and likewise are able to receive sunlight
when lower terrain is still in the dark. The distance to
the horizon, which can be used as a proxy for how far
‘beyond’ the terminator line terrain remains lit, is based
on the world’s diameter and the altitude of the location.
The distance to the horizon in kilometres is:

**_Distance(km) ≈_** (Height(km) x World's diameter(km))

For compatibility with the following equations, which are
based on degrees on the world surface, the distance in
degrees is:

**_Distance(°) =_**

Libration: A world can experience a wobble as it
revolves around its sun. An eccentric orbit results in
libration around a world’s equatorial regions. Axial
tilt results in libration around a world’s polar regions.
These effects take place over the course of a local
year, essentially ‘rocking’ the world along its equator
and poles. Unless the year is very short this is a slow
process but it might allow certain regions near the
terminator to experience periods of ‘summer’ and
‘winter’ as sunlight periodically strikes the surface.

During the course of an eccentric orbit, a locked world’s
rotation rate stays constant (one rotation per orbit) but
its orbital velocity varies, creating a year-long ‘wobble’.
For example, Luna, with an eccentricity of about
0.055, has a libration amplitude of nearly 8°. Accurate
formulation and additional factors not considered here
make this calculation very complex. For simplicity,
assume eccentricity has a linear relationship with the
amplitude of the libration and estimate the span of the
libration in longitude on the equator is equal to 145
times the eccentricity:

Eccentricity Longitudinal Libration (degrees) =
145 x eccentricity

This effect will ‘yaw’ the world back and forth, exposing
the region near the terminator, especially near the
equator to periods of sunlight and sunset. This formula
world physical characteristics

360 x Distance(km)
� x World's Diameter(km)

is likely to be less realistic for very eccentric orbits. For
eccentricities above 0.3 the Referee should consider
reducing this multiplier in stages from 145 towards 90.

For a world with an axial tilt, during the course of a local
year, the axial tilt of the world will expose an additional
slice of the world’s surface to sunlight equal to its axial
tilt times the sine of the latitude:

**_Tilt Latitudinal Libration (degrees) =_**

Axial Tilt x sin(latitude)

This effect will ‘pitch’ the world forward and back,
exposing more of one polar zone to sunlight and then
the other. Most worlds locked to their primary do not
experience much axial tilt, so this effect is often not
very pronounced.

Solar Disk Size: Another factor in the breadth of a twilight
zone is the actual size of the disk of the sun: the sun of
a world close enough to be tidally locked is liable to be
larger than a point, perhaps as much as two or three
degrees wide. Therefore, along a region of the twilight
zone, all or part of the sun may hang above the horizon.

The size of the disk of a world’s sun determines how
much is visible. At the terminator, the sun is assumed to
be half set but will still be visible in part across a stretch
of longitude equal to half its angular size. The angular
size of a star is determined from the procedure in ‘How
Big is That Thing in the Sky?’ on page 119. The width of
the band between where the sun is completely visible on
the horizon to where it is completely set is equal to the
sun’s angular size on the surface of the world, or half of
this size on either side of the terminator:

**_Solar Disk Visibility Band (°)_**

Only on the ‘bright’ side of this band is the full sun visible
in the sky (assuming a flat horizon and ignoring the
curvature of the planet), so sunward of this point, the full
bright side rotation factor of 1.0 could be applied.

Multiple Stars Separation: When a locked world orbits
multiple stars, those stars also orbit each other and at
various points one or more stars may appear above the
horizon. To determine how far, use the separation of
the stars in AU plus their diameters (converted to AU)
to determine their angular separation as the angular
size for use in the equation. The period of the stars’

= ± Angular Size(°)
2

orbit determines the rise and fall of the (assumed for
these purposes) smaller of the two stars above the
terminator. This calculation assumes the plane of the
stars’ orbit and those of the planet are the same.

Atmospheric Refraction: Atmospheric refraction can
cause a sun to appear to be on the horizon or above
it, even after the sun has set. This will extend the
twilight zone into the dark side. It will also increase
the span of the bright side. Atmospheric refraction is
highly variable but on average can be assumed to be
about 0.5° on Terra. Assume it increases in proportion
to pressure and decreases 1% for every 3 degrees in
temperature or roughly:

**_Refraction (°) =_** 0.5 x

For extra complexity, the atmospheric pressure
would be lower at higher altitudes but so would the
temperature and the distance to the horizon. These
factors could also be considered.

Atmospheric Scale Height, Horizon and Twilight:
Light persists after the full setting of the sun or before
sunrise because the sun is still shining on the visible sky
or upper atmosphere (see the discuss on terrain, above).
On Terra, the resultant phenomena have many names
but of note are the different definitions of twilight:
•	 Civil twilight occurs when the sun is less than 6°
below the horizon and artificial light is not needed.
•	 Nautical twilight occurs when the sun is between
6° and 12° below the horizon and the horizon and
vague shapes are discernible
•	 Astronomical twilight occurs when the sun is
between 12° and 18° degrees below the horizon
and most astronomical objects are visible but fainter
objects at sixth magnitude or dimmer are not visible.

The dark edge of each of these periods is considered
to be their ‘dusk’ at night or ‘dawn’ in the morning. Many
factors can influence the persistence and magnitude of
twilight – just as many can influence the colour of a sky.
In general, the scale height of the world’s atmosphere
and the curvature of the world determine the distance
beyond the horizon that the light of a sun can influence
the visible sky. Obviously, a world with no atmosphere
has no scale height and no ability to experience these
forms of twilight but for all other atmospheres, trace and
above, for simplicity, twilight will extend in proportion to
scale height and the world’s Size:

The previous equation determines the spread of each
type of twilight zone (civil, nautical and astronomical)
for various worlds in degrees along their longitude
surface. Each could indicate a stepwise or gradual
decrease of the rotational factor until -1.0 is reached at
the dark edge of astronomical twilight.

SIMPLIFIED METHOD FOR


MAPPING TWILIGHT ZONE WORLDS


All factors above can lead to special situations and
unexpected effects but the level of detail provided is
not necessary in most cases. To map a tidally locked
twilight zone world, the following principles can apply:

1. Turn the world map sideways: Treat the bright side
    as the top, the dark side as the bottom and the
    terminator as the ‘equator’. The north pole is now
    at the centre of the map and the south pole is on
    the far edges. In this situation the 10 triangles that
    form the centre row of hexes, or half the map area,
    represent the region + 30 o from the terminator line
    and the upper and lower triangles represent the
    next 60° to the bright or dark centre of the world.
2. Assume that a Sol-sized star will shine 1° (from
    both disk size and refraction) into the dark side of
    the world at 1 AU. To determine the actual number
    of degrees simply multiply 1° by the star’s actual
    diameter and divide by the AU distance of the orbit.
    From the terminator into the dark side, this is the
    twilight zone area where the sun is visible. In this
    region, the rotation factor = 0.0.
       3. On the dark side, use 6° as a default measure of
          each zone of twilight (this can be adjusted by scale
          height and size). The start of civil twilight begins
          when the sun fully sets. Reduce the rotation factor
          gradually or in steps, with the dark edge of civil
          twilight = -0.3, the dark edge of nautical twilight
          being -0.6 and the dark edge of astronomical
          twilight reaching -1.0. From there (about 19° into
          the dark side) to the other side of the dark side
          where astronomical twilight begins, the rotation
          factor remains -1.0.
       4. The temperature begins increasing at the
          terminator. For each 3° into the bright side increase
          the rotation factor by 0.2 until it reaches 1.0 at
          15% into the bright side. This is about half of the
          distance between the terminator and the end of the
          central triangles.

TEMPERATURE SCENARIO:
ALTITUDE TEMPERATURE FACTOR


Rather than delving into possible atmospheric layers,
inversion effects, cloud levels and other minutia,
this book will simply assume that on worlds with an
atmosphere the temperature will tend to drop as
altitude increases. The basic simplifying assumption
for altitude-related temperature changes is that the
initial greenhouse factor is related to the atmospheric
pressure, but the world’s atmospheric factor
modifying the luminosity effects is a global value
unchanged by altitude, as it distributes heat across
the entire atmospheric layer.

world physical characteristics

Determination of the effects of altitude can come from
two previously introduced equations. The first is derived
from the scale height and the pressure at altitude
equation on page 81. To review, this equation provides
the atmospheric pressure at an altitude above mean
baseline altitude as:

**_Pressure(a) =_** Pressure(m) ÷

Pressure(m) is the mean base altitude pressure in bar,
H is the world’s scale height in kilometres and height(a)
is the current altitude above mean baseline altitude,
also in kilometres. The Referee can use the pressure
at the current altitude to recompute a new ‘initial’
greenhouse factor based on Pressure(a) as:

**_New 'initial' Greenhouse Factor =_**

0.5 x Pressure(a)

Determine the adjusted Greenhouse Factor(a) by adding
or multiplying the original greenhouse modifier (if
this has not been retained, the Referee may need to
perform some reverse engineering to determine it).

This new value, Greenhouse Factor(a), based on
Pressure(a) is now used to compute the temperature with
whatever basic or modified Luminosity(x) is appropriate:

**_Temperature(a)(K) =_**

279 x

**TEMPERATURE SCENARIO: STELLAR FACTORS:**

**MULTIPLE STARS (WITH ECCENTRICITY)**
Multiple stars within a system can add temperature to
a world. As stars and planets orbit the system, varying
proximity will change the luminosity effect of each
star. For the case of binaries in companion orbits, this
variance is often minor or results in only short-term
variation, as noted in previous examples. If the effect
is minor, the Referee can use a combined luminosity
value and an average distance to compute the
temperature – computing the temperature by using this
combined luminosity value should result in the same

value as computing them separately for each star at
the same AU then combining the temperatures with the
temperature addition equation.

Each star except the primary has an Orbit# and
an eccentricity value, as does the world (or parent
planetary body for moon worlds). For temperature
calculations, Orbit# must be translated to equivalent
AU values. These can be plotted in a table and, if
helpful for visualisation, with a basic diagram. In this
handbook, orbits are simplified, defining only two
parameters: the eccentricity and semi-major axis (AU)
property. To calculate the temperature extremes and
a mean value, the following procedure assumes that
these orbits line up with each other.

For each star, the high temperature contribution for a
star is the temperature when the star is closest, the
low when it furthest away and the mean is determined
by not considering the eccentricity of the various
orbits at all. For a system with a single star, or with a
pair of stars treated as one, these assumptions have
already been accounted for by the Near AU and Far AU
calculations for determining high and low temperatures.
For multiple stars or detailed effects of a pair of stars
previously considered as one, the Referee can create
a table of high, mean and low temperature influences
from each star in the system.

The simplest approach computes each star’s high
contribution distance from nearest by subtracting the
planet’s AU orbit from the star’s AU orbit (0 in the
case of the primary). Note that distance values will be
squared so the sign is unimportant. Compute mean
contribution distance from the average distance, or the
square root of the squares of the planet’s AU orbit plus
the star’s AU orbit. Low is the furthest distance or the
sum of the planet’s AU orbit and the star’s AU orbit.

When considering adding eccentricity to these AU
values, the Referee can assume an average effect
and ignore the eccentricities altogether, or take a worst
case approach, where eccentricity will make the orbits
as close as possible for the high temperature and as
far as possible for the low temperature. Mean distance
remains unchanged but high (nearest) distance
becomes the difference between the planet’s AU × (1 -
eccentricity) and the star’s AU × (1 + eccentricity) if the
star is interior to the planet or the difference between
the planet’s AU × (1 + eccentricity) and the star’s AU
× (1 - eccentricity) if the star is exterior. Low (furthest)
distance becomes the planet’s AU × (1 + eccentricity)
plus the star’s AU × (1 + eccentricity), regardless of
whether the star is interior or exterior.

The Referee could potentially incorporate other factors,
such as axial tilt, rotation and geography to further
modify luminosities to push high and low temperatures
to further extremes, but such factors should never be
added to a mean temperature determination. These
further complications are rarely necessary; the Referee
could consider how the eccentricity and axial tilt effects
apply, which depends on where in each orbit they occur
and when they apply to a specific hemisphere. These
effects might not be felt evenly on both hemispheres
of the planet. For instance, one may be closer to its
star during winter months and further during summer,
mediating these effects in one hemisphere and only
reaching the extremes computed in the other, or the
closest approach could occur in spring or fall, meaning
axial tilt values should perhaps not be considered at all.

The Referee may choose what is appropriate for
luminosity values for these equations. For multiple star
systems, it can be complex to even make a detailed
approximation of high, mean and low temperatures. If
desiring precision and to understand the benefit and
effort trade-off for making approximations of ‘reality’,
consider the Zed Prime example:

This example is purely based on the orbit of Aab
IV, Zed Prime’s gas giant primary and ignores any
seasonal axial tilt variation – they would potentially
need to be applied to both the planet and the moon.
A strict calculation should also account for the nearly
four million kilometre orbit of the moon around the
planet, but this will also be ignored here. A table is
needed to determine the combined effects of different
stars at differing distances:

The MaxS and MinS column values represent the
maximum (AU × (1 + eccentricity)) and minimum (AU ×
(1 - eccentricity)) separation from the primary star. The
pair Cab stars are treated as one star for simplicity.

The MaxP AveP, and MinP column values represent
the furthest, mean and nearest distance a star comes
to the planet in this simplified representation. For

the primary star (Aa), this the same as the planet’s
MaxS, AU and MinS values. For the other values are
determined as described in the section’s text.

Next, for each star, calculate the temperature
contribution for each low, mean and high values
using the temperature formula with albedo = 0.33 and
greenhouse factor = 0.59. Finally add these columns
together using the temperature addition equation.

Star Temperature Contributions
Body Luminosity Low Mean High
Star Aa 0.738 243.30 255.17 268.98
Star Ab 0.681 234.47 250.02 269.32
Star B 0.136 63.71 71.61 85.43
Star Cab 0.896 12.36 15.00 20.67
Total — 284.41 300.68 320.48

This provides the following temperature ranges for
Zed Prime, rounded to the nearest degree: low =
284K, mean = 301K, high = 320K. One thing to note
before being overwhelmed by the maths is that had
these calculations been performed strictly with the
pair Aa and Ab, the temperatures would have been a
fraction of one degree cooler and if they were treated
as a single sun and, ignoring the rest with just the
planet’s orbital differences, the results would have
been 287, 300 and 317, which is a difference of three
degrees at the margins – a value earlier discounted as
too short term to be relevant, so the Referee should
decide how much precision is necessary.

None of this accounts for axial tilt, geographic or
rotation effects. The Referee in this case will choose to
ignore all of the above complexity – negating the value
of this exercise other than to show how it is possible –
and use the values of 346, 300, and 262 – a broader
range already established using the effects computed
for the single star ‘approximation’ of high, mean and
low already determined.

world physical characteristics

_A complete and accurate temperature profile of this_
one world of Zed Prime orbiting a gas giant would
require pages of calculations and charts, an advanced
computer program or a custom made Antikythera-like
mechanism and still add little to the game.

Given the potential for both exacerbating and
moderating interactions between temperature effects,
the Referee can choose which to apply and how
much detail is necessary to develop. As stated in
the beginning of the temperature section, the only
temperature needed for describing a world is the
mean temperature. Still, a high and low temperature,
if expected to have an impact on habitability should be
considered but beyond these three global numbers, the
Referee should have some justification for spending
the amount of time required to investigate complex
variances that have no effect on the gaming session.

**TEMPERATURE SCENARIO:**

**INHERENT TEMPERATURE EFFECTS**
An inherent temperature effect is a background global
effect which persists over long periods. An example is
internal heat from planetary creation or ongoing seismic
or tidal stresses. This effect can uniformly alter all
temperature values for a world by adding to all of them
and so should be computed last.

Such temperature effects can be added to modify each
temperature results using the temperature addition
equation:

**_New Temperature =_**

(Old Temperature^4 + Added Temperature^4 )

Other temperature effects, such as the reflected light
or internal radiance of a parent body or a large moon
can add to overall temperature (or sometimes just to
the temperature of the ‘bright’ hemisphere of a moon
locked to a parent planet) but in most situations are too
minor to be worth the calculation.

**GAS GIANT RESIDUAL HEAT**
Occasionally, residual heating effects of a young and/
or massive gas giant may increase the temperature of
the body and contribute to its overall temperature. For
a gas giant, a useful estimated formula for its inherent
temperature is:

**_Temperature (K) =_** 80 x √ Mass⊕ ÷ Age (Gyr)

This effect would be added to the temperature of the
gas giant from the luminosity of its sun(s) using the
temperature addition equation. The Referee could
then consider the gas giant a dim ‘star’ and use the
luminosity formula to determine its heating effect on
nearby moons.

For Zed Prime’s gas giant at 1,200⊕, its size could be
a factor in heating even after 6.336 billion years. Its
inherent temperature by the above formula is 187K. Its
cloud top temperature based on its suns and an albedo
of 0.40 is 235K. Adding these temperatures yields an
effective temperature of 256K. An extremely diligent
Referee may choose to use this number to determine if
the gas giant’s heat adds to Zed Prime’s temperature in
any significant way but it seems unlikely at a distance
of 3.92 million kilometres (it actually adds 0.0055K to
the planet-facing temperature).

SEISMOLOGY


Some worlds are geologically dead, others in a state
of constant eruption, bursting with rivers of magma.
Several factors, internal and external, contribute to
seismic stress.

RESIDUAL SEISMIC STRESS AND HEATING


Residual heat is based on the cooling rate of a world
from its formation and from the decay of radioactive
elements. It is most directly related to a world’s Size
and age. By default, a world is effectively seismically
dead after it is older than its Size in billions of years.
Having a moon or being a moon and the associated
tidal stresses can modify the time it takes for the
residual heat to dissipate, as can the quantity of heavier
elements in the world’s interior.

**_Residual Seismic Stress =_** (Size – Age(Gyrs) + DMs)^2

World is a moon DM+1
World has Size 1 or
larger moons

DM+1 for each Size (1 or
greater) of each moon,
up to a maximum DM+12
Density greater than 1.0 DM+2
Density less than 0.5 DM-1

Round down the value prior to squaring.
Values of less than 1 prior to squaring are treated as 0.

For instance, Terra (density exactly 1), a Size 8 world
with a Size 2 moon is 4.568 billion years old: 8 -
4.568 + 2 = 5.4322 rounded down to 5 and squared,

world physical characteristics

so its residual seismic stress is 25. Luna (density
0.6) is: 2 – 4.568 + 1 = -1.5, which is less than 1 and
therefore 0 residual stress.

Zed Prime is a Size 5 moon with density 1.03 and is 6.3
billion years old: residual seismic stress is: 5 - 6.3 +1 (for being a moon) +1 (for density) = 0.7, rounded down
to 0 prior to squaring.

TIDAL STRESS FACTOR


To determine overall stress on a world from tides,
add together all tidal effects in metres from page 126
and divide this number by 10 to determine a tidal
stress factor:

**_Tidal Stress Factor =_**

Round down the result. In most cases, except planets
orbiting close to stars and moons orbiting large planets,
this result will be less than 1.

For Zed Prime, the resultant effect of its parent planet (30.6) and stars (0.24) and other minor factors from
the other moons is relatively low, so ~30÷10 is 3
stress from tides.

TIDAL HEATING EFFECTS


Another effect of tidal forces is tidal heating. Even
if a world is locked to its primary, if its orbit retains
any eccentricity, the changing forces on the world
as it completes a revolution around the parent body
causes tidal movement across the entire body. In the
Solar System, this is what contributes to volcanic
activity on moons such as Io and Enceladus. Io’s
crust flexes as much as 100 metres from tidal
forces. Most tidally locked worlds have a near zero
eccentricity, as over time this tidal energy forces
a circularisation (less eccentricity) of the orbit, but
in cases with an orbital resonance, as with both Io
and Enceladus, the eccentricity can persist. The
factors involved in tidal heating are complex and the
Referee can ignore them by setting a tidally locked
world’s orbital eccentricity to 0, but for those wanting
the extra realism, tidal heating on a world from its
primary can be approximated from this relationship:

**_Tidal Heating~_**

For a moon in orbit around a planet, use standard days
for the value of period and millions of kilometres for
distance. For Io, this formula results in a value of about
303,000. Plugging in the same numbers in for Enceladus
results in 33,000. For Luna it is 52, a relatively
inconsequential result. To address seismic and heating
factors, divide by 3,000 to treat a result equivalent to
Io’s condition as a tidal heating factor of 101 (Enceladus
would be 11) and ignore numbers less than 1.

**_Tidal Heating Factor=_**

Zed Prime is also subject to tidal heating forces in
its rather eccentric orbit around its primary. Plugging
values into the equation results in a Tidal Heating
Factor of 14, more in line with Enceladus than Io but
still substantial.

TOTAL SEISMIC STRESS


Total seismic stress is the sum of the residual seismic
stress, ongoing tidal stress and tidal heating factors:

Total Seismic Stress = Residual Seismic Stress + Tidal
Stress Factor +Tidal Heating Factor

The value for total seismic stress determines the
chances of both earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
A world with a total seismic stress level of more than
100 has at least one ongoing volcanic eruption at
any given time and near constant earthquake activity.
A world with a total seismic stress level of less than
1 is essentially geologically dead. Total seismic
stress can also globally influence a world’s climate
by adding an inherent temperature factor to all high,
low, mean, local or periodic temperature values to
determine the actual temperature:

New Temperature =
Old Temperature^4 + Total Seismic Stress^4 )

For Terra, this adds only 0.004K to its temperature,
which is inconsequential, drowned out by its external
heating. Howver if Terra’s base temperature had been
25K instead of 288K, seismic stress factors would
have added 4.7K to temperature and if Terra had been

a rogue world in deep space with a base temperature
of 10K, the seismic stress heating value would be the
primary factor in its surface temperature. For most
worlds in the habitable zone, the seismic heating factor
can be ignored for temperature purposes but it can still
play a significant role in determining seismic activity.

Zed Prime has a total seismic stress of 0+3+14=17.
The new temperature equation using values of 300K
and 17K alters the mean temperature from 300K to
300.00077, rounded back to 300K. Inconsequential
for temperature but enough to allow for some
ongoing geologic activity.

**TECTONIC PLATES**
Worlds with a total seismic stress value of more than 0
and a liquid water-based Hydrographics code of at least
1 can have a crust divided into a number of tectonic
plates. Only if both these conditions are true do moving
tectonic plates exist and the number of plates is:

**_Number of Major Tectonic Plates =_**

Size + Hydrographics – 2D + DMs

Total seismic stress between 10 and 100: DM+1
Total seismic stress greater than 100: DM+2

If the result of this check is 1 or less, then no tectonic
plate activity exists on the world. Without tectonic plate
activity, mountain building only occurs from isolated
volcanoes or in regions of rising crust. These regions
can become continents if they were once under
an ocean, or if already on land they may result in
continent-sized highlands.

The actual odds of volcanic or earthquake activity
occurring vary greatly by location. The total seismic
stress factor provides a global frequency but can also
be a multiplier for likely activity in a particular region.
The factor is a modifier for the Referee to consider in
planning both the frequency and severity of activity. It
may influence settlement patterns on a world or even
architectural styles. Worlds with widespread activity and
a total seismic stress factor of more than 100 may not
even have long-term permanent settlements but mobile
populations or even housing that can be relocated if
local conditions become unbearable.

See the Determining World Surface Features
section on page 134 to apply tectonic plate details
to world mapping.

Zed Prime has a total seismic stress factor of 17 and
so has some tectonic activity. The total number of
major tectonic plates is 5 + 6 - 2D + 1. A 2D roll of 8
results in 4 major plates.

NATIVE LIFEFORMS


A world’s native life is life that has evolved with or
completely acclimated to a world’s environment.
These rules make no distinction based on the
ultimate origin of the life; it may have originated on
a world, have arrived via panspermia from another
world in the same or a nearby system, or have been
introduced as part of a terraforming effort thousands
of years earlier. Native life is an integral part of the
planet’s biosphere, which helps regulate its present
atmosphere and temperature.

By this definition nearly all worlds with Atmosphere
codes 4–9 or D, and most with Atmosphere codes 2, 3
and E have native life. Some worlds with Atmospheres
A, B, C, F+, or even those with a Trace (1) or Vacuum (0) Atmosphere codes may have native life but these
biospheres might be very different from ‘normal’
carbon-based lifeforms.

Suggested Usage: The Referee does not need
to check every significant world in the system for
lifeforms but should do so for the mainworld and
consider doing so for other worlds in the habitable
zone. Checking every vacuum world for a minute
chance of biomass will undoubtably result in too many
worlds with life. If the Referee wishes to check for life
in unlikely and inhospitable places, a single 2D roll for
all the inhospitable worlds of a system, with perhaps
a natural 12 as a target number might be more
appropriate, with placement of the actual life-bearing
world determined by choice or chance.

BIOMASS RATING


Biomass is a descriptive indicator of the amount of
native life present on a world. Only systems older
than 0.1 Gyrs have natively evolved recognisable
life. To determine the presence and amount of native
life present on a world roll 2D with a large number of
possible DMs:

Biomass Rating = 2D + DMs*

world, assume a temperate world receives a temperature-related of DM+2, a cold world receives DM-2 and a boiling
or frozen world receives DM-6.

A biomass rating of 0 or less indicates no native life
exists. A healthy garden world has a biomass rating of
A (10) or more. The biomass rating is an exponential
indicator of the amount of life present in an average
square kilometre on or near the surface. A Size 4 and a
Size 8 world with the same biomass rating would have
a similar ‘density’ of life, but across the entire surface
area of the two worlds, the larger world would have
more total life – absolute world-wide biomass scales by
a factor of the square of world Size.

Special Case 1: If a world has an atmospheric taint
or irritant of type ‘biologic’ but rolls a biomass rating of
0, its biomass rating becomes 1 and its biocomplexity
rating is automatically set to 1.

Special Case 2: A rolled biomass rating of 1 or
more on a world with Atmospheres 0, 1, A, B, C or
F+ represents life not likely to be compatible with
[[Terra|Terran]] life. If it exists, it could be well-developed within
this environment. Add one less than the negative
Atmosphere DM to the biomass rating for such worlds,
e.g., for Atmosphere B, add 4.

Optional Rule: The Referee may rule that any
world with oxygen in the atmosphere (Atmosphere
codes 2–9, D and E), has at least a biomass rating
of 1. This may not be appropriate, as some non-biological processes may result in atmospheric
oxygen. The Referee could choose to apply this rule
only to Atmosphere codes 4–9 and D, instead. The
Referee could also apply a ‘rare earth’ variant of this
rule and change the Atmosphere code of any world (with codes 2–9, D, and E) with a biomass rating
of 0 to Atmosphere code A and retain the previous
atmospheric code as this exotic atmosphere’s subtype.

world physical characteristics

Zed Prime has an Atmosphere of 6 and a
Hydrographics of 6. Its mean temperature is 300K, and
its high temperature is 346K. System age is 6.3 billion
years, It receives DM+4 (+1 for Hydrographics, +2 for
temperature and +1 for age) on its 2D roll for 6 + 4 =
10, or biomass rating A.

**BIOCOMPLEXITY RATING**
Biocomplexity is a descriptive indicator of the nature
of lifeforms, ranging from simple microbes to highly
evolved multicellular organisms. If a world has
Biomass 0, it has Biocomplexity 0. If a world has a
positive biomass rating:

**_Biocomplexity Rating =_**

2D-7 + Biomass Rating* + DMs
*Biomass ratings above 9 are treated as 9 for this roll

Atmosphere not 4-9 DM-2
Low oxygen taint DM-2
System age between 3 and 4 Gyrs DM-2
System age between 2 and 3 Gyrs DM-4
System age between 1 and 2 Gyrs DM-8
System age less than 1 Gyr DM-10

If the system age is exactly at a limit between two DMs,
use the worst DM. A result of less than 1 becomes

1. The Biocomplexity Rating table indicates the most
advanced organisms possible at various ratings.

At any rating on the biocomplexity scale, more primitive
organisms persist and may be the dominant type in
biomass or in numbers of species. A biocomplexity
rating of 8+ does not necessarily mean that native

Biocomplexity Rating

Biocomplexity Description Examples
1 Primitive single-cell organisms Procaryotes such as bacteria and archaea
2 Advanced cellular organisms Eucaryotes such as algae and amoebae
3 Primitive multicellular organisms Lichen, sponges, some fungi
4 Differentiated multicellular organisms Ediacaran and early Cambrian age creatures
5 Complex multicellular organisms Insects, ferns, fish
6 Advanced multicellular organisms Reptiles, birds, mammals, flowering plants
7 Socially advanced organisms Ants, bees, primates, elephants
8 Mentally advanced organisms Sophont intelligence, psionics
9 Extant or extinct sophonts At some point, this world had sophont lifeforms
A (10)+ Ecosystem-wide superorganisms Cooperative sophont-like behaviour

sophonts exist, but that forms exist that could easily
evolve or qualify as sophonts. This is likely to include
many ‘borderline’ species such as cetaceans and
primates. Additionally, at biocomplexity 8, some
lifeforms may have evolved psionic abilities; this need
not be associated with intelligence but may be just a
form of psionic lure or camouflage.

At biocomplexity 9 a sophont species either currently
exists or has existed in the past, although it may
not have been technological nor left any trace. If
the species has left obvious signs of its existence, it
may have permanently altered a world’s biosphere
through degradation or enhancement. Additionally,
at biocomplexity 9 in universes where psionics is
prevalent, psionics become a major element of the
ecosystem, with multiple organisms evolving to take
advantage of various psionic abilities. At biocomplexity
A (10) or above, cross-species links may cause the
entire world’s ecosystem to behave as a Gaia-like
organism; this behaviour might not be immediately
obvious to an observer, or could take an overt
form at the Referee’s option, potentially including
recognisable consciousness.

Biocomplexity does not necessarily follow [[Terra|Terran]]
patterns or look anything like the examples provided
but on most worlds, life consists of specialised
‘kingdoms’ of autotrophs or primary producers who
generate energy from non-living sources (e.g., most
plants and some procaryotes) which are generically
referred to as ‘flora’, and heterotrophs, or secondary
producers, which are generally referred to as ‘fauna’.
Even these distinctions are less than clearcut and other
very broad characterisations such as motile versus
sessile also fail to capture the overall nature of a
continuum of organisms or provide easy categorisation.
Detailed generation of lifeforms is beyond the
parameters of this book.

world physical characteristics



Zed Prime has a biomass rating of A, treated as 9
for the biocomplexity roll, and a system age above 4
billion. The roll is 2D-7 + 9 and a roll of 3, results in
only 5, so the life is complex, but not overly complex:
simple plants and animals, perhaps similar to the
Devonian age on Terra.

Rare Earth Universe Variant: In some universes,
advanced life will be rare, occurring only after an
unlikely series of events. In these settings, the
Referee can impose a DM-2 on all biocomplexity rolls
and only allow a positive modifier of biomass rating
÷2 (with no limit). In these universes, and perhaps
even in those without a negative DM to complexity,
the Referee should consider changing the Atmosphere
codes for all worlds of Atmosphere codes 4–9 with a
biocomplexity rating of 1 to exotic atmospheres (code
A) to reflect a lack of free oxygen and impose the low
oxygen taint, if not already present, on any worlds of
biocomplexity rating 2 and 3.

NATIVE SOPHONTS


If the world’s biocomplexity rating is 8 or above, determine
if a native sophont currently exists or once existed:

Current Native Sophont Exists on 13+:
roll 2D + Biocomplexity* – 7
*Biocomplexity ratings above 9 are treated as 9 for
this roll

To determine if evidence exists of an extinct native
sophont on the world:

Extinct Native Sophont Existed on 13+:
roll 2D + Biocomplexity* - 7 + DMs
*Biocomplexity ratings above 9 are treated as 9 for
this roll

If system age is greater
than 5 Gyrs

DM+1 (for the extinct
sophont check only)

Even if the biocomplexity rating is 9 or more, an
extinct sophont, especially a primitive race that died
of million or billions of years earlier may have left no
trace; this roll only accounts for those which have
left noticeable artefacts or other indications of their
existence. Detailed generation of native sophonts is
covered in The Sector Construction Guide’s Sophont
Design chapter (page 50).

Zed Prime’s life is not advanced enough to warrant a
check for native sophonts.

BIODIVERSITY RATING


A world’s biodiversity rating is an indicator of the
number of species present on a world. In some cases,
it represents the health and resilience of its biomass
but on some worlds, a few dominant species are able
to provide a stable environment through feedback
mechanisms. Biodiversity tends to increase with
complexity but again, exceptions exist. On some worlds
a hive species and its specialised food sources may
completely dominate a region or even an entire planet,
or sophonts could have devasted the ecosphere.
Only worlds with a biomass rating of 1 or more have
a biodiversity rating of more than 0. To determine a
world’s biodiversity rating:

**_Biodiversity Rating =_**

2D - 7 +

Results are rounded up and if the result is less than 1, it
becomes 1. A biodiversity ofA (10) or greater indicates
complexity equivalent to pre-human Terra. Biodiversity
of less than 3 indicates a very uniform biosphere with
limited species dominating most environments.

Zed Prime’s biomass rating isA (10) and its
biocomplexity rating is 5, so on 2D-7 + (10+5)÷2, a roll
of 6 equals 6.5 rounded up to a biodiversity rating of 7,
not particularly diverse, but probably not a problem for
the ecosphere’s stability and resilience.

COMPATIBILITY RATING


Another important attribute of native life is its
compatibility, or how well the native life’s biochemistry
meshes with other biochemistries. The compatibility
rating is defined in relation to its compatibility to [[Terra|Terran]]
life. While this works well for Terragen species, it
does not necessarily indicate compatibility for other
sophonts. A world’s compatibility rating should be
independently determined for commonality with each
interested sophont species.

A high compatibility rating is a two-edged sword. It
means that [[Terra|Terran]] organisms are able to survive on the
world and that many native forms of life may be edible
food substances but it also indicates native diseases
can potentially infect Terragen hosts, and native
predators and parasites may find Terragens tasty. Only

world physical characteristics

Biomass Rating + Biocomplexity Rating^
2

worlds with a biomass rating of more than 0 can have
a compatibility rating of other than 0. To determine the
compatibility rating:

**_Compatibility Rating =_**

2D - + DMs

Atmosphere 0, 1, B, G, or H DM-8
Atmosphere 2,4,7,9 or otherwise tainted DM-2
Atmosphere 3,5 or 8 DM+1
Atmosphere 6 DM+2
Atmosphere A or F DM-6
Atmosphere C DM-10
Atmosphere D or E DM-1
System age greater than 8 Gyrs DM-2

Round results down. If the compatibility rating is 0
or less, all native life is incompatible and the rating
is set to 0. This means that the life’s biochemistry is
too different to provide any nutrition. This does not
necessarily mean the life is otherwise safe; a predator
may still attempt to eat a Traveller and some biologic
taints could still be hazardous, potentially behaving
more like particulates than lifeforms but still be
dangerous or at least irritating.

A compatibility rating ofA (10) is equivalent to full
[[Terra|Terran]] compatibility and greater values are possible.
If the world’s life has a compatibility rating of at least
1, any particular biological material’s compatibility
rating is equal to its world’s compatibility rating plus
2D-7. The material does not benefit from receiving
a rating of more than 10 (except, at the Referee’s
option, being especially tasty or providing some
other beneficial biologic effect) but if the rating is less
than 10, then its nutritional value is its compatibility
rating times 10% and any deficit in nutrition must
be supplemented by an equivalent amount of fully
compatible food or supplements.

Zed Prime has a biocomplexity rating of 5 and DM+2
for Atmosphere. A roll of 7 becomes a result of 7 + 3

- 2.5 + 2 = 9.5. rounded to 9, so the grubs and ferns
found on the world are relatively edible, very similar to
what could be expected on Terra itself.

**NATIVE LIFEFORM PROFILE**
On IISS forms, native lifeform information can be coded
as a string of four eHex digits:

MXDC



Where M = Biomass, X = Biocomplexity,
D = Biodiversity, and C= Compatibility.

Zed Prime’s lifeform profile is A579.

RESOURCE RATING


Prerequisite: For worlds with native life, determine all
native lifeforms rating characteristics.

A world may have a variety of natural resources,
including recoverable minerals, liquids, gases of
economic value and possibly biological resources
if life is present. Asteroid (or planetoid) belts use
a separate method for determining their resource
rating, detailed on page 73. For all other worlds, the
Size of the world is the main determinant in how
many resources are available and for worlds with life,
various lifeform ratings apply:

**_Resource Rating =_** 2D-7 + Size + DMs

Density greater than 1.12 DM+2
Density less than 0.5 DM-2
Biomass rating 3+ DM+2
Biodiversity rating 8-A DM+1
Biodiversity rating B+ DM+2
Compatibility rating 0-3 DM-1 (only if biomass
rating is at least 1)
Compatibility rating 8+ DM+2

If a world’s resource rating is less than 2, treat it as
2, if it greater thanC (12), treat it as C. A resource
rating determines the value and likelihood of resource
extraction enterprises:

Resource
Rating Remarks
2 No economically extractable resources
3–5 Marginal at best; avoided by most
corporations and prospectors
6–8 Worthwhile with considerable effort;
prospectors or speciality firms may be
able to turn a profit on worlds ignored by
major corporations
9–A Priority targets for both corporations and
individual prospectors
B–C Liable to experience a resource ‘rush’
when first opened up for exploitation

world physical characteristics

Biocomplexity Rating^

A world’s resource rating can decline over time. Every
century of unfettered exploitation may change a
world’s resource rating by D3-3 but a well-managed
world may be able to alleviate or limit this decline
and/or convert resources into sustainable industry.
In no case should this exploitation reduce a world’s
resource rating below 2.

Zed Prime is a Size 5 world. DM+3 results from its
biomass rating ofA (+1), and compatibility rating of 9 (+2). Rolling 10 on 2D, its resource rating is 10-7 + 5 +3
= 11 or B, meaning it likely experienced a resource rush

Size 0–4† DM-1 Limited surface area

Atmosphere 3 or D DM-3 Very thin or very dense atmosphere
Atmosphere 4 or 9 DM-2 Tainted thin or dense atmospheres
Atmosphere 5, 7 or 8 DM-1 Thin, taint (standard), or dense Atmospheres
Atmosphere B DM-10 Hostile Atmosphere

Mean temperature less than 273K* DM-2 Too cold most of the time
Low temperature less than 200K* DM-2 Much too cold some of the time
Gravity less than 0.2† DM-4 Unhealthy low gravity levels
Gravity 0.2–0.7† DM-2 Very low gravity

Gravity greater than 2.0† DM-6 Gravity too high for acclimation

*For applying temperature DMs, if, and only if, detailed temperature calculation were not determined for the world,
assume a hot or cold world receives DM-2 and a boiling or frozen world receives DM-6.
†Assume the worst DM for gravity at the edges of a DM criteria. If gravity is not computed, use the Undefined gravity DM
instead.

and may continue to be a profitable place to extract
resources, including biological products.

HABITABILITY RATING


A world may be perfectly suited to its native lifeforms
but partly or wholly unsuitable to settlers from another
world. A world’s habitability rating is particular to one
species or to related species originating on the same
world, such as Terragens. The habitability rating
described in this section applies to Terragens. Other
sophonts might require separate ratings.

**_Habitability Rating =_** 10 + DMs

world physical characteristics

The base natural (pre-human) habitability rating of
Terra is considered A or 10. A world’s rating depends on (usually) negative DMs from this value.

Theoretically, a habitability rating ofC (12) is possible
but very unlikely. A habitability rating of less than 0 is
treated as 0. Surveyors also include a miscellaneous
scoring category which can raise or lower a world’s
habitability rating based on unique factors that
mitigate or worsen some conditions or result from a
unique factor. This category can be simulated with
D3-1, or the Referee can examine certain features,
such as the type and severity of taint in a world’s
atmosphere and deliberately apply a +1 miscellaneous
habitability rating adjustment.

Habitability
Rating Remarks
0 Actively hostile world: not survivable
without specialised equipment
1-2 Barely habitable world: full protective
equipment often needed
3-5 Marginally survivable world with proper
equipment
6-7 Regionally habitable world: may
require acclimation
8-9 Suitable for human habitation with
minimal equipment or acclimation
A+ Terra-equivalent garden world

A rating applies to an entire world. There may well
be hostile regions on a world with a rating of A and
survivable regions on a world with a rating of 0, but
these are not large or permanent enough to warrant a
change in the scoring.

Zed Prime does not have direct Size, Atmosphere
_or Hydrographics modifiers to habitability. Its high_
temperature of 346 exceeds 323 for a DM-2 but mean
temperature is within bounds, as is low temperature.
Gravity is only 0.66, so that warrants a DM-1, making
Zed Prime’s habitability rating equal 7. The Referee
could choose to roll D3-1 for an adjustment but
instead considers that the gravity is close to where it
would actually give a DM+1, a net change of +2 and
notes the rather warm mean temperature is close to
where it would give a DM-2, and so decides that these
two factors balance and keeps the habitability rating
at 7. Zed Prime is only regionally habitable, mainly
because of the heat, so it is likely some areas would
experience more temperate conditions, although

with such a high axial tilt, it may take the Referee
some time and effort to determine the best locations,
especially since coastal areas suffer from very high (if
slow) tides from the parent planet.

FINAL MAINWORLD DETERMINATION


If a mainworld has yet to be determined, the Referee
must pick a mainworld prior to moving on to developing
this world’s social characteristics in the following
chapter. Criteria for choosing a mainworld include:
•	 Highest habitability rating
•	 Native sophonts are present
•	 Highest resource rating
•	 Best refuelling location

Still, the Referee is free to ignore these
recommendations and pick another world, based on
any factor including the Referee’s whims.

For the Zed system, the Referee could perhaps choose
the barely habitable (SAH = 340) moon of the next
gas giant as the mainworld. However, in this case, the
selection of Zed Prime (SAH = 566) will be used going
forward. However, the other moon, hereby dubbed Zed
Secundus, will be used as an example of secondary
world characteristics in the following chapter.

world physical characteristics



MAINWORLD MAPPING


A mainworld is most often an entire planet, with a large
variety of terrain, ecosystems and local conditions. The
effort a Referee puts into developing this depends on
how Travellers will experience the world. If they are
simply passing through a starport, especially a highport
or an environmentally controlled downport and startown
area, then no map is necessary and a world’s social
and derived characteristics – particularly Law Level
and Tech Level are more worthy of the effort to develop
further than geography.

If a map is needed, it could be a world map for
reference, or local maps specific to the region(s) where
the Travellers will adventure. Here MOARN – Map Only
As Really Necessary – comes to the forefront.

WORLD MAPS


Traveller world maps are based on a 20-triangle
regular icosahedron (a D20) approximation of a
sphere. Each triangle is subdivided into hexagons.
When mapping a world, a Referee may choose one
of two methods to determine the size and number of
these hexagons:

METHOD 1: Standard map, variable hex size.
The standard world map template method assumes
seven hexagons across the base of each triangle or
35 hexagons across the undivided middle section of
a map. This map has the equivalent of 490 hexagons
total (there are 12 mapped 5/6 hexagons, so for
sticklers treating these as ‘whole’ makes 492). For
most purposes, such as sizing continents or oceans,
five hexagons can be considered 1% of the world’s
surface area. The circumference of a world – π times
diameter – is 35 hexes across, so the width of a world
hex is Size × 1,600 × π ÷ 35. For a Size 1 world this
would be 143 kilometres per hex. Therefore, Size ×143
kilometres would set the hex scale for any Size world.
For a Size 7 world this is about 1,000 kilometres.

METHOD 2: Standard scale, variable hex number.
Another paradigm for creating world maps assumes
a standard hexagon size of 1,000 kilometres across.
In this case, the number of hexagons in a triangle is
equal to the Size of the world. A Size 7 world matches
the standard world map template but separate map
templates with differing numbers of hexagons per
triangle would be necessary for each world Size.

The advantage of using a standard scale is presenting
a more-or-less constant distance across each hex size (close, not completely accurate if using exact kilometre

diameters for worlds). A disadvantage, besides the
need for 10 or more different map templates, is that
their total hex count will vary, making continent or
ocean sizing less consistent. Still, a consistent number
of triangles (20) allows for the assumption that a full
triangle is 5% of a world’s surface area.

Standard scale, variable hex number maps allow for
the extension of standard scale sub-maps within each
hexagon. If a world hex is considered a 10-subhex-wide
region, with the sub-hexes each 100 kilometres across,
then each of those can be divided into 10 kilometres and
one kilometre sub-hex maps. If instead using a standard
map with a variable hex size, the first ‘level’ of sub-hexes

- if set to 100 kilometres – would be a variable and not
necessarily easily divisible number of sub-hexes, as the
number of these sub-hexes per world hex would need to
be equal to the world hex scale (143km × Size) divided
by 100, or else the sub-hex would need to continue the
paradigm of standard map, variable hex size.

DETERMINING WORLD SURFACE FEATURES


For worlds with continents and oceans, the
Hydrographics code and surface feature distribution (see page 100) can inform the size, quantity and
distribution of land and water. On a standard
490-hexagon world map, five hexes equal about 1%
of the surface area, so major bodies should occupy
at least 25 hexes and each minor body at least five.
A scattering of small bodies can also help reach the
proper number of land and water hexes for the world’s
Hydrographics code.

For placing terrain features, one consideration is
temperature. On a world with liquid water, if a Referee
wants to make a rough latitude-based temperature
profile for a world, the following general regional
guidelines can apply:
•	 Permanent icecaps or glaciers exist where the high
temperature never exceeds 273K
•	 Agriculture and unprotected settlements require
a high temperature above 278K and a mean
above 273K
•	 Unprotected settlements require a high temperature
below 323K or a mean below 318K

Unprotected settlements’ assume humans. Other
species might have other restrictions. Detailed climatic
classifications and weather patterns are beyond the scope
of this book but temperature can inform local conditions.

The seismology of a world has an impact on terrain
features such as mountain ranges and volcanoes.
A total seismic stress level above 1 implies at least

world physical characteristics

some periodic seismic activity, which can include
mountain-building from volcanic activity or plate
tectonics, if present. On worlds with tectonic plates,
their interaction becomes a possible guide for surface
features. Each of the world’s plates has a relationship
to its neighbouring plate. The Referee can place and
size the world’s plates as desired, perhaps traced
lightly on a world map. For each interacting pair, the
Referee can determine the interaction by rolling 2D on
the Plate Interaction table above.

The mountain ranges and volcanic features of a world
whose seismic activity has stopped will eventually
erode but this rate of erosion is tied to weathering
effects and can be assumed to correlate roughly with
atmospheric pressure. Estimating the passage of time
since residual seismic stress reached zero (see page
125) and multiplying that time period by atmospheric
pressure could provide guidance on the current state of
eroding mountains on a seismically dead world.

Tidally locked worlds are a special case to consider
in mapping. As mentioned on page 104, for ease of
representation the Referee can choose to rotate the
world map 90 degrees, so the middle of the world
map (normally the equatorial zone) is the terminator
line or the middle of the twilight zone, with the bright
side to the top, or ‘north’ and the dark side to the
bottom or ‘south’.

IISS PROCEDURAL


One basic objective of the Scout Service is to ensure
that any system within or near the Imperial border is
subject to at least a Class III survey, detailing all of the
system’s significant bodies, identifying and providing a
basic classification of life-bearing worlds and noting any
large-scale features or anomalies.

While exploration office teams may conduct a Class
II survey of some intermediary system on their way
to a targeted objective system, survey office teams
rarely stop at a Class II survey at a targeted system.
If an internal or external mapping team embarks into
a system, a Class III survey with a completed report is
normally the minimum effort of an expedition.

Plate Interaction

2D Interaction Effect
2-5 Converging The plates are colliding, causing mountain building at their intersection
6-8 Transversing The plates are sliding past each other forming faults or terrain discontinuities
9-12 Diverging The plates are moving apart, causing trenches or rift valleys

A statutory, but often partially unfulfilled, objective of
the IISS is to verify the data in a Class III survey every
20 years within the Imperium and every century in
regions within 40 parsecs beyond its borders. Staffing,
prioritisation and diplomatic issues may curtail these
ongoing efforts. Systems rarely change significantly
during intervals between Class III surveys and the
main justification for the repetitive surveys – other
than the budget of the internal and external mapping
branches – is for this effort to act as a tripwire to
detect non-physical changes in the systems, such
as the arrival of new settlers or the establishment
of outposts and commercial stations at different
locations within a system. This detection can result in
a thorough follow-up investigation.

CLASS III SURVEY


The purpose of a Class III survey is to accurately
record the physical characteristics of all the significant
bodies within a system. This involves the deployment
of probes to at least fly by the system’s planets and
significant moons. On worlds of particular interest, such
as those within the habitable zone or with evidence of
native life, landing teams are often deployed to conduct
sample gathering and assess environmental conditions,
although this may be limited to probe landings and
analysis instead if resource limitations or hazards
make landings unpractical. A Class III survey makes no
effort to establish contact with sophont native residents
but if local populations belong to a contacted culture,
communications are not prohibited and may occur at
the discretion of the scout team leaders.

The time required for completing a Class III survey is
usually about 10 weeks. Some of this period involves
flight time between various worlds. If the system
is fairly compact, a Class III survey could take as
little as 30 days but if it consists of widely separate
worlds or subsidiary stars in far orbits, short-range
jumps might be used to complete the survey and its
duration may exceed 100 days.

At the end of the survey, the SI of the system is 8,
providing a reasonably accurate estimate of the
Size, Atmosphere and Hydrographics of all planets
and significant moons. Habitable zone worlds often
receive the most attention but no attempt is made to

An outcome of a completed Class III survey is a filled
out and verified Class III survey form. In most cases
this data is then released in the RPSC database and
freely available to all Imperial-registered starships.
The scout team usually begins work on a Class IV
Planetary Profile Form for interesting worlds or the
recognised mainworld but the data is tagged as
preliminary, for internal use only, and not released into
the RPSC database.

**CLASS IV PART P SURVEY**
For worlds with no known population, a targeted
physical-only Class IV survey of a world might be
undertaken as an adjunct to a Class III survey of a
system. This survey is often referred to as a Class
IV Part P or Class IV-P world survey. While a full
Class IV survey may require more than half a year

to complete, a physical survey of even a complex
life-bearing world usually requires no more than 30
days. This survey almost always includes at least one
landing but standard procedures call for at least three
sample-gathering expeditions to separate locations on
the world’s surface. Usually these are conducted by
the crew but in some instances such as on worlds with
highly corrosive atmospheres, the surveyors will only
conduct one-way probe missions and gather nothing
more than data and images from the surface with no
expectation of probe recovery.

Most Class IV-P surveys are investigations of
unexplored worlds beyond the Imperial border. The
Scout Service does not consider these deep targeted
surveys as necessary for confirmation of details of
previously explored worlds, although this level of
study was conducted on many worlds, inhabited
and otherwise, during both grand surveys. Both the
exploration branch and the external mapping branch
conduct these surveys, with the exploration branch
normally targeting ‘interesting’ worlds for initial
examination and flagging ‘notable’ worlds for the survey
office to follow up on during a subsequent expedition.

Class IV physical surveys of planetoid belts use a specialised version of the form:

world physical characteristics


Inhabited worlds, mainworlds or others, have codes not
only for their population, government and Law Level (PGL) but also for their Tech Level and starport class,
though only the mainworld is considered to have an
official starport – the rest are classified as ‘spaceports’
and use a different rating. These UWP ratings are
broad categories with many potential subtypes and
idiosyncrasies. This chapter will explore these factors.
Additionally, beyond the scope of the PGL, a world
will have a particular culture or multiple cultures, an
economy and other characteristics of its people and
society that makes the world unique. The procedures
in this chapter assume the Referee has designated
a mainworld for a system or that a mainworld and its
UWP already exists.

PREREQUISITE: INITIAL UWP AND

TRADE CODE COMPLETION


Prior to adding detail to a world’s social characteristics,
the Referee should complete the basic rolls for
population, government, Law Level, starport type and
Tech Level using the process, DMs and tables in the
Traveller Core Rulebook pages 147-218 to create
a full UWP for worlds which do not have one. All of
these characteristics (and more) will be covered in
considerably greater detail in their own sections, but
having these initial values established allows for a
smoother flow through the processes in this chapter.

Some DMs also require knowledge of trade
codes which are based on the UWP. Trade codes (agricultural, et. al.) can be determined from the table
on page 260 of the Traveller Core Rulebook or from
page 186 of this book.

For Zed Prime the physical UWP or the SAH portion
of the world is already computed. To complete the
remaining characteristics, the population roll is 2D-2 =
9-2 =7, government is 2D-7 + 7 =7-7 + 7 = 7, Law Level
is 2D-7 + 7 = 6-7 + 7 = 6. The starport has no DMs for
population and a 2D roll of 8 makes it Class C. Finally,
a 1D roll for Tech Level with DM+2 for government and
DM+2 for the starport is a 4, making the Tech Level

8. Zed Prime’s complete UWP is C566776-8. These
characteristics give the world the trade codes of Ag (Agricultural) and Ri (Rich).

NATIVE SOPHONT MODIFICATIONS


A world with a native sophont population, especially a
newly contacted population, should use modified UWP
generation procedures appropriate to that species.

Population: In most cases, native sophont
populations will number in the millions or greater.
The Referee can certainly choose to have sophont
species with only a few or perhaps even one
member: either a lone survivor of a dying race, the
hivemind of a globe-spanning super-organism or
something in between but these should be special
cases. The following methods are suitable for native
sophont populations:
•	 Rolling 2D-2 but rerolling any result below 6
•	 Rolling 2D-2 but changing any roll below 6 to
either 6 or 7
•	 Rolling 2D3+4

An alternate way creating rare ‘odd’ or low population
native sophont worlds could be to roll 1D and add 4 for
most worlds but if the 1D result is a 1, then instead roll
2D-7. If the result of the 2D-7 roll is negative, treat it as
positive. Subtract the result of this roll from 6 to get a
population of 1–5.

Beyond the mainworld, at least during a sophont
species’ initial expansion, populations of other worlds
they might settle are generally dependent on the
mainworld’s population or at least overshadowed
by it and should not exceed its value unless some
disaster forced an exodus.

Government and Law Level: In most cases
determination of government and Law Level for native
sophonts can use the procedures in this book, although
the Referee may choose to implement special cases for
unique sophonts, either creating different government
types or enforcing certain governments and legal
systems specific to the sophont.

Starport: The Referee may choose to impose a
negative DM on starport class for native sophonts
to simulate a higher chance of encountering a more
primitive native species. In most cases a DM-2 would
be appropriate. If the Referee does not want a species
to be starfaring, at least not by jump drive, a starport of

class A should be unavailable, likewise, if the Referee
does not want the species to be capable of spaceflight,
class D or worse is most appropriate.

Tech Level: Native sophonts are assumed to be
adapted to their homeworld. They do not receive any
Tech Level DMs for SAH characteristics of their native
world, nor are they bound by any Tech Level minimums
for their homeworld’s environment.

POPULATION


Determination of population for a mainworld depends
on the origin of the population. For most worlds, the
general population procedure is sufficient but worlds
with a native sophont population warrant a modified
procedure (see above), especially if they are the only
intelligent inhabitants of the world.

The population digit of the UWP is generated with a roll
of 2D-2 for a system’s mainworld. The population code
indicates the number of people to the power of 10 living
on a world, e.g., Population 6 indicates 1–9 million
people. A Population of 0 generally means zero people,
although it could refer to any number less than 10.

Population Code Values
Population Range
0 0
1 1 – 99
2 100 – 999
3 1,000 – 9999
4 10,000 – 99,999
5 100,000 – 999,999
6 1,000,000 – 9,999,999
7 10,000,000 – 99,999,999
8 100,000,000 – 999,999,999
9 1,000,000,000 – 9,999,999,999

B (11) 100,000,000,000 – 999,999,999,999
C (12) 1,000,000,000,000 – 9,999,999,999,999

MegaTraveller introduced the PBG numbers to
extended system information, with the P standing for
population and giving a numeric value (1–9) to the
population code: A Population code 6 world with a P
of 3 would have a total population of about 3,000,000.
This information exists for many Charted Space
systems but for a newly generated system, it can
be created with two D3 rolls, the first equalling 0, 3,

or 6, and the second adding 1–3 to that number, as
indicated in the Population P Value table. The end
result will be referred to in the follow sections as the
total world population.

Population P Value
First D3 + Second D3 = P Value
1 = 0 1 1
1 = 0 2 2
1 = 0 3 3
2 = 3 1 4
2 = 3 2 5
2 = 3 3 6
3 = 6 1 7
3 = 6 2 8
3 = 6 3 9

Instead of the above, a Referee could roll d10 and
reroll a 0. Adding a population P value allows for
documentation of a world’s population to at least one
significant number. It does however pose a question
about how the Referee should deal with the extreme
population codes of 0 andA (10) or how to indicate
greater population precision.

POPULATION 0
For most purposes, this population code should be
treated as no population, with a 0 for the P value as
well. This allows consistent use of the barren (Ba) trade
code and makes it clear at a glance that a world has
no known or permanent inhabitants. There may be
an undocumented population or temporary residents
but officially, the world is unoccupied. The population
code of 1 would cover the range of 1–99 recognised
residents, with a P value of 1 covering the range of
1–19 inhabitants.

**POPULATION A**
Populations in the tens of billions would be rare but
a flat distribution of 10 to 90 billion residents may
not be appropriate in all circumstances. First, even
with a continued high natural increase and heavy
immigration, it would likely take 1,000 years or longer
to reach as many as 90 billion. Projections for 21st
century Terra suggest the population will peak at
barely more than 10 billion and never even approach
20 billion. But Traveller is based on science fiction
settings. Charted Space has had human interstellar
travel for 10 millennia and other methods than natural
reproduction such as cloning can account for large
populations in shorter timeframes. Alien sophonts may
world social characteristics

have differing rates of natural increase and extreme
longevity may drive populations ever upward, even
with a low birth rate.

Population A Variants: The Referee can choose to
stay with a default linear distribution on populations
in the tens of billions or may choose to decrease the
odds of larger P numbers for these worlds. A method
that still allows the same theoretical range is to begin
with a value of 1 for P and roll 1D: on a result of 5 or 6,
increase the P value to 2 and rolling again with each
subsequent 5 or 6 increasing it by 1 and repeating
the process until rolling a 4 or less or until reaching

9. Variation on the ‘P extinction rate’ could require a 6
for a P increase, or 4–6 for a P increase, or a varying
requirement as P values increase.

**ADDITIONAL SIGNIFICANT DIGITS**
While an inhabited world will have a P value of 1-9,
any additional significant digits for the population could
have any value from 0 to 9. A d10 can provide digits for
arbitrary precision – though not to the level of fractional
people. To keep with the intent of certain values as
a cut-off for purposes of trade classifications, these
additional digits should always be added to the previous
value, even if they would cause the population to round
up to a greater value if the precision were removed; a
Population code of 6 implies 1,000,000 – 9,999,999
people. A Population code 6 world with a P value of 9
and a subsequent d10 roll of 9 would have 9,900,000
people, but its Population code would still be 6.

REGIONAL POPULATION DIFFERENCES


Recently settled regions are less likely to abide by the
standard 2D-2 population roll. The Sector Construction
Guide provides suggestions for developing frontier
populations profiles on pages 17–20, but as a simple
expedient a Referee could apply a DM to the population
roll: a negative DM for frontier regions. A positive
DM for long-settled regions is possible, although
the standard 2D-2 provides a good range for settled
sectors where backwaters may still exist, although it
could be appropriate to add a small positive DM to
worlds along established trade routes, in important
system clusters, or on major interstellar jump-1 mains.

Adding a positive DM to the population roll allows
for the possibility of worlds with populations in the
hundreds of billions (B) or trillions (C). The Referee
may choose to allow this but such worlds are likely
to dominate the relative population and economy
of a region to such an extent as to overshadow
everywhere else. If that is the type of setting the
Referee wishes to create it should be a conscious
choice, not the result of a random roll. If using
population values so large, a variant method for
generating diminishing P values should be considered,
at least for the largest population code.

For Zed Prime, the Population code is 7, or tens of
millions. Rolling for the P number results in a D3:D3 roll
of 1:1 or 1, and the Referee chooses to add one more
digit with a d10 roll of 8, giving the Zed Prime a total
world population of 18,000,000.

world social characteristics



DEMOGRAPHICS


The population value and P digit make no distinction
as to what sort of ‘people’ inhabit a world. They could
all be human, a combination of sophonts and in some
universes (not generally in Charted Space) they could
even be robots.

From a sophont perspective, noting variance from
the ‘normal’ population is more important than listing
the normal population – normal is something to
emphasise at the polity, subsector or sector level.
While it can be recorded on a survey form or data
sheet for completeness or to display in isolation, a
world’s demographics information should focus on
any significant deviations from a normal population.
This is especially relevant for a sophont species’
homeworld or worlds with unusual immigrant or
secondary population groups.

Travellermap maintains a list of four-character sophont
codes for Charted Space and uses these on the map
information on that site. This list is located in the
remarks section of the Second Survey data description
at https://travellermap.com/doc/secondsurvey#remarks.
The standard method to display such data is by adding
these to a world’s remarks (the trade code section),
appended by a digit representing the 10s of percent
of the population consisting of that sophont, with 0
representing less than 10% and an appended W
indicating that the sophont represents the bulk, or close
to 100% of the planet’s population.

POPULATION CONCENTRATION


While no pattern is absolute, as technology begins to
advance, worlds tend towards greater urbanisation.
Two factors govern this: the first is the decrease in
relative population needed to produce food. While
a TL1 society might have more than 90% of the
population dedicated to food production, by TL8
the requirement drops to 2%. The second factor is
efficiency of service delivery. A concentration of people
requires less infrastructure in transportation and power
transmission networks, hospitals and other facilities
required for a higher technology civilisation. Beyond
TL8, in wealthier or free societies, this concentration
may reverse, as wireless transmission of data and
power, and services such as telerobotic medicine and
fast ad hoc transport allow for dispersion of services
with less associated cost. Governments may wish to
concentrate population for environmental or for control
reasons but options become greater at higher Tech
Levels; by TL10 whole cities may float in the sky or be
composed of sub-units that could disperse or cluster

as desired. Cities may even exist in orbit, either hosting
a world’s highport, providing exclusive domains for
industry or for a world’s coddled elites.

Other factors, such as general habitability or the
available habitable area, limited to the twilight zone of
a tidally locked world or the equatorial regions of a cold
world, may also affect concentration and urbanisation
levels. The size of the population is also a factor in
global dispersion of that population.

A world’s urbanisation ratio depends upon the
concentration of its population to specific regions of a
world’s surface (or orbital space). On a world with a
Population code below6 (less than 1,000,000 people)
roll 1D. If the roll is greater than the population value,
then the entire population resides in one settlement area.

On most worlds, a settlement area is defined as a
single 1,000km hex on a world map. For a Size 0 world,
this implies all settlement is on a single asteroid or
space station. Concentration into one region gives a
world a population concentration rating (PCR) of 9.

If 1D roll is greater than Population code , PCR = 9,
otherwise

Roll 1D + DMs on the Population Concentration
Rating (PCR) table

If the roll is less than the population value or if the
population value is 6 or more, roll 1D on the on the
population concentration rating (PCR) table with DMs
for a world’s specific conditions:

The minimal sustainable TL is determined by the
Tech Level and Environment table on page 175.
Worlds with a Population code of 9 or more have
a minimum PCR of 1; otherwise, the minimum is

0. The maximum PCR value is 9. A PCR is also
useful for mapping settled regions on worlds with
a moderate (Population code 6–8) amount of
people. For these worlds, each value of the rating
corresponds to about 10% of usable surface area
without significant settlement. For instance, a world
with a PCR of 3 would have 30% of usable hexes
without significant settlement and 70% with at least
some settlement. Worlds with populations in the
billions have populations spread across most of the
world regardless of PCR, but the PCR indicates the
clumping of major urban areas.

A world’s total urbanisation level is influenced by
its PCR and other factors. To determine a world’s
urbanisation level, roll 2D on the urbanisation
percentage table with DMs for relevant conditions.
Some of these DMs have a minimum or maximum
listed. If range rolled based on the table results
violates a percentage listed with a DM, roll based
on the maximum or minimum as indicated for that
DM instead. A minimum value will supersede a
conflicting maximum value.

A world’s total urban population can be computed from
population and urbanisation values:

Urbanisation %

People are considered part of the urban population
if they reside in a town or city of more than 10,000
people or in a settlement that includes 50% or more

world social characteristics



of the world’s total population. On a balkanised (government code 7) world the definition includes
any settlement with 50% or more of the nation’s total
population. On worlds of Tech Levels greater than 9,
‘virtual cities’ may exist as cultural or demographic
units but in most cases a threshold density of 100
people per square kilometre and geographic continuity
are considered the minimum requirements for a true
urban area. In some arcologies, the population density
may be in the millions per square kilometre and such
giant edifices often measure their population density
in people per cubic kilometre instead.

Zed Prime’s UWP is C566776-8 and its trade codes
are agricultural and rich. To determine the PCR, the
1D roll has DM+1 (Tech Level), DM-2 (government),
DM-2 (agricultural), and DM+1 (rich) for a net DM of
-2. Rolling a 5 - 2 = PCR 3 or partially dispersed, with
settlement areas possible over 70% of the world’s
land or coastal surface – the extreme tides make
the Referee rule out the coastal waters and limit
settlements anywhere near the coast.

For Zed Prime’s urbanisation %, the Referee rolls 2D
with DM-1 (minimum sustainable TL is 0-3) and DM+2 (Tech Level), DM-2 (agricultural) for net DM-1, rolling a
7 - 1 = 6, which requires a 1D and D2 roll on the range
table resulting in 34 + 2 × 2 + 1 = 39%. Checking that
against maximum and minimum restrictions from Tech
Level (90% maximum) and agricultural (same) requires
no changes. Total world population × 39% gives Zed
Prime a total urban population of 7,020,000, which the
Referee chooses to round to 7,000,000.

NUMBER OF MAJOR CITIES


Major city population is the combined population of its
major cities – if the world only has major cities, then
this is the entire urban population. As populations
increase and disperse, the population of major cities
becomes a subset of the urban population. Determining
the number of major cities or urban concentrations
depends on the world’s population code and PCR.
Varying cases have varying procedures:

Case 1: Any world with a PCR of 0. For worlds with a
PCR of 0, no large cities exist, although a multitude of
smaller urban areas may dot the planet.

**_Major Cities =_** 0

**_Major City Population =_** 0

Case 2: Population code is 5 or less and PCR is 9. In
this situation:

**_Major Cities =_** 1

**_Major City Population =_** Total Urban Population

Case 3: Population code is 5 or less and PCR is
1 – 8. The world cannot have more major cities than its
population code. Any city is a major city.

**_Major Cities =_** Lesser of 9 - PCR or Population Code

**_Major City Population =_** Total Urban Population

Case 4: Population code is 6 or greater and PCR is 9:

**_Major Cities =_** Greater of Population code – 2D or 1

**_Major City Population =_** Total Urban Population

The result is the number of major cities present on
the world. If the result is 1 then as with the previous
case, the world has only one concentrated city with
the world’s entire urban population. On a Population A
world, this could be a continent-spanning urban region
but is considered one contiguous city. For results
of multiple cities, follow the procedure for major city
populations below to determine actual populations.

Case 5: For all other concentration values:

**_Major Cities =_** 2D - PCR +

**_Total Major City Population =_**

Round results up. Results of less than 1 are equal to

1. This will result in 1–31 major cities on a world. If the
world’s Population code is less than 6, then the major
city quantity for that world is limited the value of its
Population code. The actual population of each major
city can be determined by the methods described in

x Total Urban Population

the next section. In the interests of sanity and time, the
Referee may wish to limit the described major cities to
the largest 10, regardless of the results of this case.

Zed Prime has a PCR of 3 and a 39% Urbanisation
Rating with a Total Urban Population of 7,000,000.The
world’s major city count is 2D - 3 + 0.39 × 20 ÷ 3 or rolling
7 - 3 + 0.39 × 20 ÷ 3 = 6.6, rounded to 7 major cities.

**MAJOR CITY POPULATION**
Major city is a relative term. It refers to the largest
population centres on a planet, whether they are
continent-wide arcology clusters or a few hamlets.
These cities account for the bulk of a world’s total
urban population. The population of a city is subject to
interpretation. A city may have its population defined
by its official borders, its metropolitan area or by its
built-up urban area. The IISS standard is to attempt
to estimate the latter figure to give a true picture
of the urban environment and relate it back to the
urbanisation rate, regardless of how a local government
might define a city’s boundaries and population.

If the Referee desires to determine the population of
individual major cities, there are several separate cases
to consider with increasing complexity:

Case 1: Worlds with a PCR of 0. No major cities
exist. The largest city is equal in size to the world’s
total urban population divided by 100, or 1D +2 ×
10,000 people, whichever is less. If the result is less
than 100 people, then the largest city population
becomes the larger of the world’s total urban
population divided by 10 or just 1D+1 people.

Case 2: Worlds with one major city. For these:

**_Single Major City Population =_** Total Major City

Population

Case 3: Worlds with a PCR of 1-8 and 2–3 major city:

This population is spread among major cities, with each
accounting for at least 1% of the major city population.
If only two or three major cities exist, the population can
be determined using a method similar to that used to
determine atmospheric gases:

**_First Major City Population =_**
((1D + 3) x 10% ± variance) x Total Major City Population

Repeat this procedure for the second and third major
city using the remaining unallocated total major city
population, ensuring that each city receives at least
1%, and assigning any remainder to the first city.

Case 4: Worlds with a PCR of 1–8 and four or more
major cities. All major cities should have at least 1%
of the Major City Population. To ensure that each city
receives at least 1% of this population, create a simple
table and follow this process:

1. Make one table entry per major city and assign it
    1% of the total major city population.
2. Subtract the number of major cities from 100
    (100 - major cities) to determine the remaining
    pool to spread among the cities. If detailing no
    more than 10 major cities on worlds where the
    results are greater, reserve at least 1% for all
    the major cities rolled, not just the ones being
    detailed in this process.
3. Create population percentage ‘chunks’. Use the
    PCR as the maximum size in percent of each
    chunk to allocate. As the minimum chunk size,
    make sure the number of chunks is at least twice
    the number of major cities. Use whole numbers for
    chunk size. For instance, if there were nine major
    cities, there should be at least 18 chunks, so of the
    remaining (100-9 = 91) percent, there should be at
    least 18 chunks or chunks equal to 91÷18 or 5%
    in size, regardless of PCR. If the PCR was only 3,
    there could be 91÷3 or 30 total chunks.
4. Divide (100 - major cities) by the PCR to determine
    the whole number of chunks available, holding
    back any remaining population percentage.
5. For each major city roll 1D and allocate that many
    chunks to the city, continuing until all major cities
    have received 1D chunks, or until there are no
    more chunks to allocate.
6. If chunks remain, return to the first city and
    continue adding 1D chunks at a time to cities until
    no chunks remain.
7. Assign the remaining population percentage to the
    city that would have received one more chunk after
    the last whole chunk is gone.
8. Total the percentages for each city.
9. For each city, multiply the percentage by the
    amount of people represented by 1% of the total
    major city population.
10. Reorder cities from largest to smallest, if desired.
11. For identically sized cities, or any city, if desired,
    add some variance of an appropriate amount or
    transfer some people from one city to another to
    vary city population but ensure every major city has
    at least 1% of the total major city population.

world social characteristics



See the Zed Prime example below for a demonstration (with table) of Case 4:

For Zed Prime (PCR 3)the total major city population is
3 ÷ (1D+7) × 7,000,000 rolled as 3 ÷ (3+7) × 7,000,000
= 2,100,000 people. To allocate these people:

1. Each of the 7 cities has at least 1% of this population.
2. The total number of major cities is 7. 100 - 7 = 93
3. The chunk % maximum is based on the PCR of 3.
    There must be at least 14 chunks for 7 cities.
4. The number of chunks is 93 ÷ 3 or 31 chunks,
    with no remainder.
5. The Referee rolls 1D for each city, allocating 2, 4,
    2, 3, 1, 2, 6 or a total of 20 chunks
6. With 11 chunks to go, the Referee rolls 3, 4, 3 and
    4, but the last roll is reduced to from 4 to 1 as that
    city gets the last of the 31 chunks.
7. There are no partial chunks to allocate – the last
    city would have gotten the partial as well.
8. For the seven cities, the percentages of major city
    population are 1+(2+3)×3, 1+(4+4)×3, 1+(2+3)×3,
    1+(3+1)×3, 1+1×3, 1+2×3 and 1+6×3, or 16%,

medium sized cities should be larger than 1% of the
major city population and small cities should be no
larger than 0.1% of the major city population but the
Referee is otherwise free to allocate the remaining
urban population as desired.

An unusual city of any type is more expensive to build
and maintain than a normal city. These cities exist for a
few reasons: as protection from a hostile environment
or populace or as a prestigious residence or symbol
for a world’s elites. In some cases, specific industrial
processes such as gas, ocean mining or space
manufacturing may also warrant an unusual city type.
Prototech versions of cities are also possible, although
extremely expensive – a steam-punk city on rails is
certainly a possibility. This list of types is not meant to
be entirely comprehensive; a city inside a giant nuclear-powered gyro-stabilised mono-wheel could certainly
exist, coded as Mx, but the Referee should invent a
backstory for its existence.

If Referees wish to randomly determine if a city is
of an unusual type, they can roll 2D for 12+ with the
following DMs:

Starport A with highport DM+1
Starport E or X DM-2
Atmosphere 0, 1, or A DM+2
Atmosphere B DM+3
Atmosphere C DM+4
TL9–12 DM+1
TL13–15 DM+2
TL16+ DM+3
Industrial DM+1
Non-Industrial DM-1
Rich DM+1
Poor DM-1

The type of unusual city still requires Referee
choice based on circumstances or whim. In certain
environments cities might be arcologies, underground
or underwater by default because of the world’s
surface conditions.

Zed Prime, a rich world at TL8, has a DM+1 and would
only randomly have an unusual city on a roll of 11+, or
_1:12 per city. The Referee, seeing little justification for_
an unusual city, forgoes the roll.

**OTHER CITY DESIGNATIONS**
The Referee may choose to provide additional
designations to a city based on its status as a capital or
its faction, or nation membership (see the Government
section starting on page 156) or as host of a starport or
spaceport. As with any unusual city types, the Referee
can list these codes after the city’s name.

BALKANISED WORLD POPULATION DISTRIBUTION


In addition to a world population and city populations, a
balkanised world has its population allocated to various
factions and/or nations as indicated by procedures
in the Government section on page 156. Depending
on the number of nations or faction and the detail the
Referee desires to create, the Referee can allocate
population based on the method for distributing
population for cities above, or the Referee can adapt
the less formal method for determining the number of
major geographical bodies continents described on
page 152, or any other method, arbitrary or otherwise.
The number and distribution of both major geographical
bodies and cities may give the Referee some ideas
about how to distribute the population.

POPULATION PROFILE


A population profile is a compressed version of some of
the information determined in the section. The format is:

P-p.pp-C-%%-M

Where P = population code, p.pp = P value with
optional additional fractional digits, C = PCR , %% =
urbanisation%, and M = number of major cities.

Major cities may have standard profiles in the form:

Name (Codes): Population: Port

Where codes can include any city designation and
possibly faction or nation information and port is any
associated starport or spaceport class.

The population profile for Zed Prime would be 7-1.8-3-39-7. Each city would receive at least a faction
code, to be developed in the Government section
and these are presented in the Zed example form at
the end of this chapter.

SECONDARY WORLD POPULATIONS


Other worlds besides the mainworld may have a
population, either affiliated with the mainworld or
independent. These worlds will almost always have

world social characteristics



a smaller population than the mainworld and if
inhospitable are subject to Tech Level restrictions on
habitation (see page 173). Depending on the world’s
government, these secondary world populations could
be included in the total for the mainworld or be treated
as additional populations.

It is possible a secondary world population exists in a
city in space with no associated world but most often
these populations are considered to belong to some
significant body within the system. Except in rare
circumstances, the maximum population of a secondary
world is one less than mainworld’s Population code.

Rather than check every significant body in the system,
the Referee may choose to set the maximum offworld
population as mainworld population - 1D and if this
number is zero or less, it becomes unnecessary to
check any other worlds. The Referee may also choose
to assign a Population code to specific secondary
worlds. The secondary world’s population digit, or P
value, can remain random in any case.

At Zed Prime’s TL8, the prospect of worlds with
secondary populations is rather low but with a
balkanised government, it could be more likely than in
some cases. A roll of Zed’s Population code (7) minus
1D (a 2) indicates that secondary worlds of Population
code 5 or less could exist.

The Referee decides that the only secondary
populations of note would reside on other moons of
Zed Prime’s parent planet or on Zed Secundus the
barely habitable moon of the gas giant in the orbit
beyond (Aab V d). Assigning a Population code of 5 to
this desert moon and randomly generating a P value
of 1, then using d10 to add further precision gives this
moon a population of 140,000. Additional work provides
a population profile of 5-1.4-8-90-2.

For the other four significant moons of Aab IV, the
Referee arbitrarily chooses to roll 1D for the population
value, with a result of 5 or 6 meaning no population.
These rolls result in 6, 5, 6, 4, and 2, meaning that only
the two outer Size S moons have a population, the first
numbering (P digit randomly assigned) 30,000 people
and the other 700.

GOVERNMENT


A world’s Government code is determined by a roll
of 2D-7 plus the world’s Population code, resulting
in a number between 0 and 15 as indicated on the
Government Types table.

A government’s code may not correspond to its ‘official’
name or structure. A government claiming to be a
representative democracy could be anything from a
corporate government to a totalitarian oligarchy in
effective function. Likewise, an official monarchy could
be a representative democracy, charismatic dictatorship
or even a balkanised world in reality. The Government
code is the effective government. In Charted Space it
is what an IISS survey team has determined it to be.
In general Traveller terms, it is how the Referee should
treat the government and how the government will
treat the Travellers, regardless of whatever label the
government places upon itself.

BALKANISATION


If a world’s Government code is 7, then there
is no recognised central government that has
effective control over the entire world. As with other
governments, there may be a recognised union of
subordinate states but on a balkanised world, the
subordinate states have effective sovereignty or
localised dominant control over their territories and
people. Each of these subordinate governments could
be rolled for separately.

If the Referee chooses, these subordinate
governments may be represented by a total of D3+1
factions (see the Factions section on page 160), with
all members of a faction treated as having the same
government, Law Level and culture, or the Referee
can choose to subdivide these factions into individual
governments or nations.

If choosing to portray individual nations, roll 1D for each
faction to determine the number of nations within that
faction. On a roll of 5, the Referee may choose to multiply
the result by 10 minus the world’s PCR, and on a roll
of 6, also multiply the result by the world’s Population
code minus D3 (but at least by 2). For rolls of 5 or 6, the
Referee may also add some variance factors to spread
the results across differing ranges. Note this could
theoretically lead to hundreds of national governments,
which might be realistic but should be considered as
flavour, not as a prelude to developing the details of
hundreds of nations. With extreme balkanisation, the
Referee may wish to stick to overall factions or pick a
particular nation relevant to the adventure at hand to
develop. When in doubt, the Referee can choose the
faction or nation surrounding or adjacent to the world’s
starport as the government to further develop.

Balkanised world factions each roll for a Government
code using the same Population code as the world
as a whole, regardless of the strength of the faction.

for determining the sizes of each nation on a
balkanised world but the Referee can use similar

methods and results as for determining major city
populations on page 153 or even the guidelines and
results for determining major bodies on the world’s
surface on page 134 as guides.

GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE


Developing the internal workings of a government is
definitely an optional procedure. It may be important to
a specific adventure or be an interesting background
flavour for a world but in many cases it is entirely
unimportant to the Travellers if the ruling body of a
world happens to be a group of senators chosen by an
electorate of property owners and a group of random
citizens chosen by a lottery.

A world with a Government code of 0 has no
functioning government and the procedures that
follow are unnecessary. Otherwise, to be called a
government, the ruling authority must perform three
basic government functions:

Legislative: This function makes the laws. It tells the
people of the world what is legal and what is not, how to
behave and maybe even the required colour of footwear.

Executive: This function enforces the law. It ensures
the people follow the law and backs it up with whatever
force is necessary or legal, as determined by the
legislative function and evaluated by the judicial branch.

Judicial: This function interprets the law. It determines
whether the executive function is carrying out the laws
correctly and it may have the authority to consider
some laws created by the legislative function illegal
because of some pre-existing or pre-emptive law, such
as a constitution or a holy book.

These functions may all be performed by a single
drunken half-mad dictator or by multiple meritoriously
selected councils of experts but they must be
performed in some manner for a government to be
effective. A world’s government profile development
uses the following steps:

Step 1: Degree of Centralisation
Governments range in structure from a unitary or
monolithic centralised state to a confederation of
sovereign states bound by a weak authority. In between
are varying degrees of unity, of which the middle
ground is a federal government, where the central

government and component states share or divide
powers in a roughly balanced manner. This procedure
will consider centralisation characteristic of one of these
three forms as determined on the Centralisation table:

Government 2–5 DM-1
Government 6, 8-B DM+1
Government 7 DM+1 (within each sovereign
government or faction)
Government C+ DM+2
PCR 0–3 DM-1
PCR 7–8 DM+1
PCR 9 DM+3

Centralisation rolls for the governments and factions
of balkanised worlds receive both the DM+1 for
balkanisation and any DM for their specific government.

Step 2: Authority
A government’s structural components may take a
variety of names but the structure is dependent on
whether one aspect is the authoritative or dominant
function or whether a balance exists between the three
functions of legislative, executive and judicial power.

In some systems, the legislature may be authoritative,
choosing an executive and ministers from within its
ranks and appointing judicial officials. In another system
a dictator or executive council may have complete
authority to override or conduct both legislative and
judicial functions. Less frequently, a supreme group
of judicial experts may have veto authority over all
decisions by the legislative or executive functions or may
perform those functions directly, guided by a set of laws
or traditions. Finally, some systems may balance these
three functions, allowing each to limit the power of the
others. Many governments may be officially structured
in this balanced manner but this procedure is more
concerned with the functional authoritative structure
rather than any legal fictions which do not actually
describe the functioning of the governmental system.

The Authority table determines the operational
functioning and authority of the government.

Government 3, 5, C DM-2
Government B, F DM+4
Confederal government DM-2
Unitary government DM+2

Step 3: Government Structure
Each function or branch of the government has a basic
structure, ranging from a single individual to a group, to
the entire community. The structure of the authoritative
function is most important but even when one function
is all-powerful, the secondary functions still require
people and organisation to operate. The types of
composition are:

Demos (D): The entire citizenry (which may be a
subset of the population or the entire population,
perhaps with proxy rights for minors) has direct input
into the operation and decisions of the function.
Single Council (S): A single group controls the
decision-making and actions of the function.
Ruler (R): A single powerful individual with direct
subordinate officials control the function.
Multiple Councils (M): Multiple groups control some
aspect of the function, either by division of labour,
hierarchy, or checks and balances upon the other
groups within the function.

Determine the composition of each function with the
following procedures:
•	 For Government 2, the result is always Demos
for the authoritative function or for the legislative
function in a balanced authority.
•	 For Governments 8 and 9, the result is always
Multiple Councils.

•	 For Governments 3, C or F, roll 1D: 1–4 = Single
Council, 5–6 = Multiple Councils.
•	 For Governments A, B, D and E, for the
authoritative function roll 1D: 1–5 = Ruler. 6 =
Single Council; for any other function DM+2 on the
Functional Structure table.
•	 For all other governments with a legislative
authoritative function, roll 2D: 2–3 = Demos, 4–8 =
Multiple Councils 9+ = Single Council.
•	 When a Ruler or Single Council is authoritative for
the dominant function in a unitary government, that
same leadership is authoritative throughout the
government and there is no need to determine the
composition of the other functions.
•	 Except as indicated above, for each functional roll
2D on the Functional Structure table:

Functional Structure
2D+DM Code Structure
3- D Demos
4 S Single Council
5 M Multiple Councils
6 M Multiple Councils
7 R Ruler
8 R Ruler
9 M Multiple Councils
10 S Single Council
11 M Multiple Councils
12+ S Single Council

GOVERNMENT PROFILE


Subtyping for Government codes include entries for
centralisation, authority, structure, with a balanced
authority including the structure for all branches. The
basic format of a government profile is:

G-CAS

Where G = Government code, C = centralisation
code, A = primary authority code , S = structure code
of that primary authority. For instance, a federal
representative democracy with a dominate executive
council would be 4-FES. Optionally, all three branches
could be described, with the other two functions
appended; if that same government had multiple
legislative councils and a single council of judges, the
profile would be 4-FES-LM-JS.

world social characteristics



In the case of a balanced primary authority, the profile
needs to include all branches of government:

G-CBB-LS-ES-JS

Where BB = balance branches, L = legislative, S =
structure (of each function individually), E = executive
and J = judicial.

As Zed Prime is a balkanised world, its governmental
structure will be determined by faction.

FACTIONS


Even an effectively united government may have
factions of various strengths as separate centres of
power and influence. These could be a minority political
party, a particular sophont race or distinct culture, a
religious sect, a band of rebels, or some other group
opposed to the policies or structure of the current
government. To determine the number of factions:

**_Number of Factions_** = D3 +DMs

Government 0 or 7 DM+1
Government A+ DM-1

A result of 0 or 1 indicates there are no significant
factions on the world outside the official power
structure. For each faction (beyond the first), roll again
for a Government code using the same Population
code as the world, regardless of the strength of the
faction. Except for balkanised (7) worlds, if a faction
has the same Government code as the first faction, the
faction represents a splinter or rival group within the
same government. If the faction is radically different
than the government, it represents a dissident or rebel
group. If the resulting faction Government code is 7 or
balkanisation, this spawns D3+1 factions – this could
spiral into dozens of factions with repeated rolls of 7.

For worlds with Government code 0, factions represent
the unofficial political and social powers of a world, a
code of 0 indicates a familial grouping, whether just an
extended family or a larger band, clan or tribe.

Roll 2D for each faction (beyond the first) on the
Faction Strength table to indicate its relative influence.

Faction Strength
2D Code Relative Strength
2–3 O Obscure group – few have heard of
them
4–5 F Fringe group
6–7 M Minor group
8–9 N Notable group
10–11 S Significant – nearly as powerful as
government
12 P Overwhelming popular support –
more powerful than government
— G Code reserved for official government

On a balkanised world, the size of each external
faction or nation should be determined as indicated
in the Balkanisation section on page 156. But each of
these factions or nations might have internal factions
to consider.

Each faction also has a level of animosity towards
the ruling faction and possibly other factions. Roll
1D on the Faction Relationships table to determine
mutual antagonism between each pair of factions.
The Referee may choose to apply a global or specific
DM to any relationship or might set the relationship as
desired and forego the roll.

Between the ruling faction and all external
factions

DM+1

Factions have the same Government code DM-1

On a balkanised world, the Referee can impose any
DM desired between nations or factions. Those with
strongly divergent governments or cultures could
receive a positive (more hostile) DM, those more
aligned, a negative DM. The relationship column need
not be taken literally but is an indication of the level of
hostility and violence between factions. Higher hostility
is likely to have an effect on a world’s economy and the
actions and attitudes of the world’s law enforcement
and military personnel. Hostile factions may lead to
both risk and opportunities for adventurous Travellers.

**FACTION PROFILE**
The Referee should consider giving each faction,
or at least the ones not associated with the official
government, a name. Each faction, including the
governing faction can also have an assigned
designation and profile of the form:

I-G-S

Where I = a Roman numeral indicating the faction
‘number’ – this can either be replaced with a name or
combined, as in Name (I). G = Government code for
the faction. If a faction has multiple Government codes,
they can be separated by a slash character in the form
of G/G. S = faction strength, using the code from the
Faction Strength table (page 160). For instance, the
governing faction of an impersonal bureaucracy would
be I-9-G, while an obscure movement for a democratic
revolution might be II-4-O.

Each relationship between factions can be expressed
by their Roman numerals (or their names, or both)
separated by a plus character ‘+’, then an equal sign ‘=‘
and their relationship:

I + II = #

Where # = the faction relationship code. For example,
resistance between the governing faction and faction II
would be I+II=4.

This format can be used on balkanised worlds as
well, with internal factions represented by a fractional
additional Roman numerals, e.g., I.I-9-G and I.II-4-O
for the above example of government and faction.
Likewise, relations between them would be I.I+I.II=4.
Nothing but the Referee’s time and sanity prevents
the documentation of relationships between factions
or even different nations. Again, the Referee may also
choose to use names instead of Roman numerals,
especially on worlds with many nations.

Zed Prime is a balkanised world. A D3+1 roll indicates
two factions and the Referee decides to subdivide
these with additional 1D rolls of 3 and 4, resulting in
one faction of three nations and another faction of four.
Since this happens to line up with the number of major
cities, each faction can correspond to one major city and
surrounding territory. For the first group of three nations,
a roll of 2D-7+7 = 11(B) indicates that they are ruled by
non-charismatic dictatorships, while the second group
of four get a roll of 2D-7 + 7 = 3, or self-perpetuating
oligarchies. These two global factions can be expressed
as two blocks of nations: I-B-G and II-3-G. The Referee
decides to randomly allocate major cities to each of
these two blocks and to divide the world’s population in
proportions based on each city’s population.

world social characteristics



The Referee can roll to determine relationships
between the two blocks (or between all seven
nations but decides against dealing with all these
interrelationships – at least for now) and rolls 1D,
choosing to apply no worldwide DMs and receives
a 6: uprising, recordable as I+II=6. This is about as
bad as it can get without a DM. The Referee chooses
to treat this uprising result as a condition of disputed
borders on a world with a relatively low and disperse
population, meaning incursions and raids on mining or
logging camps in sparsely occupied regions.

Determining government particulars by faction, for the
first group of nations, centralisation is rolled as 2D
+1 (government B) +1 (government 7 also applies)
-1 (PCR 3)= 9 or a unitary government. Authority is
2D +4 (government B) +2 (unitary) = 13 or executive.
Structure for government B is determined on a 1D roll
resulting in 4 = Ruler. As it is a unitary government,
this ruler is authoritative throughout the government.
This government type applies to all three independent
states within the world faction. The Referee decides
that the first group of nations is led by now-hereditary
‘governors’ from the days of the world’s original
colonisation (hereafter faction I is referred to as the
‘governorship faction’), each coded as UER.

For the second group, centralisation is 2D
-1(government 3) +1(government 7) -1(PCR3) = 5 or a
confederal government. Authority is 2D -3(government
3) -2(confederal) = 2, legislative. Structure for
government 3 is rolled on 1D = 2, single council. As
a confederal government, the Referee checks for
structure for the executive and judicial functions, which
are also rolled on 1D for government 3 and, as both
result in single council the Referee rules it is the same
council in charge of all three factions. The Referee
decides the second faction is led by wealthy agricultural
landowners (and faction II is hereafter referred to as
the ‘oligarch faction’) who rule as senators. The four
oligarchies are coded as CLS-ES-JS.

Each of these seven governments might have
individual factions within them. This can get tedious,
so the Referee decides to concentrate on the largest
of the governorships. Rolling for factions within this
government – without a DM+1 since it is effectively
government B, not 7 – results in two factions. One
faction is the ruling government (already established
as I-B-G, but as this is the first ‘nation’ in the world
faction, it can be I.I.I-B-G). The other faction rolls 9 for
government – an impersonal bureaucracy. A roll of 8
determines that this faction’s strength is notable, so
it can be recorded as I.I.II-9-N. A roll of 4 +2 = 6 for

uprising, indicating ongoing low-level assassinations
and active hostility between the governor and the
bureaucracy or I.I.I+I.I.II=6.

Given these data points, the Referee considers a
scenario akin to the latter period of many dynasties,
where the bureaucracy has taken over the reins of
government, in this case against a governor who
has chosen to assert authority. Subtle but deadly
power plays absorb the governor’s retainers and
the ministerial offices are only ostensibly under the
governor’s direct authority, and none of it benefits the
people of the small realm.

The Referee could choose to apply this same factional
result to the other governorships, or to roll separately for
each, but deems it only necessary if the Travellers are
likely to get involved in the politics of a specific realm.

SECONDARY WORLD GOVERNMENTS


If other worlds within a system have a population, they
also have a government, or at least Government code.
The Referee is free to decide whether the secondary
world is subject to an authority on the mainworld or
is independent. This decision determines the method
for assigning a Government code. If a mainworld is
balkanised, at the Referee’s discretion the secondary
worlds can either belong to a nation or faction of the
mainworld or be independent. If they belong to a
government on the mainworld, they are treated as a
secondary government using the table for Case 1 with
modifiers based on their owner’s government.

Case 1: Secondary worlds under the authority
of the mainworld or a nation or faction on the
mainworld, roll 1D:

Secondary World Government Codes
Result Government Code
1 0
2 1
3 2
4 3
5+ 6

Mainworld Government 0 DM-2
Mainworld Government 6 DM + Mainworld Population

Case 2: If the secondary world is independent,
either as a ‘nation’ on a balkanised world or as a
freeport. The world’s government is independently

world social characteristics rolled using the secondary world’s population. If the

result is Government 6, the Referee can choose to
reroll or change the status of the secondary world to a
dependency of the mainworld.

**SECONDARY WORLD CLASSIFICATIONS**
A secondary world may have a specific reason for its
existence. One or more of the following classifications
may apply to any inhabited secondary world:

Since the Zed system is balkanised, the Referee
decrees a separate government for the desert moon of
Aab V d – Zed Secundus – and based on its Population
of 5, rolls 7 on 2D-7 + 5 to give it 5: feudal technocracy
as a government. This government has two factions...
which the Referee decides to leave for another day.

_As for classifications, Zed Secundus does not qualify_
as a colony, nor farming, mining, military base or penal
colony. A roll of 10 makes it a freeport (but the Referee
has already arbitrarily declared it so regardless of the
roll) and a roll of 5 indicates it is not a research base.

LAW LEVEL


A world’s Law Level is determined by rolling 2D-7 and
adding the world’s Government code. This Law Level is
an overall categorisation of the extent and enthusiasm
applied by the government to restricting the activities of
its citizens and any Travellers who might visit. The main
application of Law Level – in the minds of Travellers –
is its restrictions on weapons and armour and on the
chances of being stopped, searched, arrested and
detained. But Law Level is more than just restrictions
on weapons and prevalence of law enforcement. It

also influences personal freedoms such as speech and
assembly, and determines the amount of regulation
in economic matters such as trade and contracts.
Another consideration is the law’s applicability; in some
societies the law applies equally to all, in others, either
by statute or by custom, the law applies unequally.

On balkanised worlds, the Law Level presented in the
UWP might not apply to the entire world but only to the
government hosting or adjacent to the starport. The
Referee is free to decide how to approach varying Law
Levels, including which apply inside the starport itself.
In the Charted Space universe, starports in the Third
Imperium are subject to the Imperial law imposed by
the starport authority. The actual Law Level is 1 but
restrictions on disruptive behaviour and open display of
weapons and armour is usually stricter.

JUDICIAL SYSTEM


Different worlds have different judicial systems. They
are most commonly based on an inquisitorial or an
adversarial system but may also be based on religious
doctrine, traditional beliefs or other cultural-specific
factors. Some systems presume innocence, others
presume guilt and in a few the applicability of law may
depend on who committed it, who was victimised by it
and where or when the crime took place.

Worlds with no established governments (code 0)
may still have an associated Law Level but it is based
on community standards and informal and often
arbitrary proceedings. Such worlds have a judicial
system categorised as none (N). Other worlds with
an established government may have an overall

world social characteristics



Law Level of 0 but still have a judicial system and
subcategories of Law Level may still apply to different
aspects of the law.

Government D or E DM+4
Law Level A+* DM-4
TL0 DM+4
TL1–2 DM+2
Judicial authoritative government DM-2
*This DM does not apply to Government D or E

Inquisitorial: Also called civil law or an administrative
legal system. Statutes and procedures take precedent.
A judge or group of officials investigate and determine
if a crime has occurred. The proceedings are based
on evidence collected and decisions of guilt are
determined by the court officers.

Adversarial: Also called common law. Precedents
and interpretations of the law are paramount. The
judicial court acts as referee for a prosecutor and
defendant who present evidence to determine guilt.
Final determination may be by judicial court officials, a
jury or some other method.

Traditional: Often religious or tribal law but potentially
any other cultural practices or the idiosyncrasies of
a dictator’s whims. Guilt is determined by an expert
in the tradition or a local official. Guilt depends on
interpretations of texts, local customs or potentially
other practices including divination, trial by ordeal or
even trial by combat.

Secondary system: Even if a world’s justice system
is adversarial or traditional in criminal and private
matters, it may be inquisitional for strictly economic or
regulatory offenses. For those worlds with adversarial
or traditional systems, on a roll of 12+, DM+ Law Level,
economic infractions are handled by an administrative
court using an inquisitional procedure instead of the
general judicial system.

UNIFORMITY OF LAW


Laws do not always apply equally to all people, nor do
they apply equally in all local jurisdictions. Laws can be
personal, territorial or universal.

Personal: Laws vary based on a person’s status. This
may refer to social status, profession, caste, religion,
race or another factor. In such systems, distinct Law
Levels may apply to different parts of society, some
laws may not apply at all to some people, others only
to certain groups. Some groups may receive a DM to
determination of guilt and/or sentencing.

Territorial: Within the world or nation’s government,
subdivisions or local governments are able to set
specific laws that may not apply to the government
as a whole. Often, such differing restrictions apply
to only one or two subcategories of Law Level or
may result in complications such as non-transferable
contracts, licenses or permits.

Universal: The same laws apply equally to all.
Certain government structures have a tendency
towards uniformity:
•	 If a government structure is confederal, uniformity
is always territorial (T)
•	 If a government structure is federal, uniformity is
territorial (T) on a 1D roll of 1–5 and personal (P)
on a 6

For a unitary government and for any territory within
a confederal or federal government which has overall
territorial uniformity, roll 1D on the Law Uniformity table:

Law Uniformity
1D+DM Code Uniformity
2- P Personal
3 T Territorial
4+ U Universal

Government 3, 5 or A+ DM-1
Government 2 DM+1

The specific effects of personal and territorial law
are left to the discretion of the Referee but may
be related to cultural details of that world. In some
cases, the entire judicial system may be different for
varying groups or territories.

PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE


The basic legal tenet of whether a suspect is assumed
to be innocent until proven guilty, as opposed to being

world social characteristics assumed guilty unless the judicial system is otherwise

convinced, has a major impact on the outcome of
legal proceedings. To determine if the principle of a
presumption of innocence principle exists in criminal
proceedings, rule 2D and subtract the world’s Law
Level, with a DM+2 if the judicial system is adversarial:

**_Presumption of innocence exists on 0+: r_** oll 2D +DMs

Law Level DM-Law Level
Adversarial system DM+2

Any result of zero or more indicates that the defendant
is presumed innocent in the eyes of the law.

**DEATH PENALTY**
Some legal systems have a strict prohibition against
the death penalty. Others may demand it for the most
trivial offense. The Referee may unilaterally decide
whether a society accepts the death penalty for certain
crimes, or may determine it randomly:

**_Death penalty exists on 8+: roll 2D +DMs_**

Government 0* DM-4
Law Level 9+ DM+4

*This applies to formal legal processes, which may
be non-existent on such worlds. Actual extra-judicial
actions may result in death for the accused, whether
proven guilty or not.

The Referee is free to impose culture-wide modifications
to this roll or to change the result to a mind-wipe or
‘death of personality’ at higher Tech Levels.

**JUDICIAL SYSTEM PROFILE**
A world, faction or nation’s judicial system can be
recorded as:

**PSU-I-D**

Where P = primary judicial system code (I, A or T), S
= secondary judicial system code (whether different or
not) for economic and private matters, U = uniformity
of law (P, T or U), I = presumption of innocence as a
simple (Y)es or (N)o and D = death penalty, also (Y)es
or (N)o. For instance, an adversarial system using an
inquisitorial process for economic and private matters,
with presumption of innocence, no death penalty and
territorial variation can be recorded as AIT-Y-N, while

as a unitary system, traditional in nature, with no
presumption of innocence and subject to the death
penalty would be TTU-N-Y.

LAW LEVEL SUBCLASSIFICATIONS


The UWP Law Level code provides the basis for
the severity of a world’s laws. Subcategories of Law
Level include restrictions on weapons, economic
law, criminal law, private law and personal freedoms.
Each subcategory is based on a variance from this
overall Law Level. Results of less than zero are
treated as 0 and those aboveJ (18) may be treated
as J. Beyond Law LevelC (12), law enforcement is
broadly oppressive and its qualities are covered by
the universal characteristics of the Law Level Effects:
Criminal, Private and Personal table (page 168).

WEAPONS AND ARMOUR


This subcategory is not typically a distinct body of
law but it covers a specific topic of great interest to
Travellers. The weapons and armour banned at each
listed Law Level are generally banned for civilian
possession. Just because a weapon is not banned this
does not mean it is freely available and public displays
of even legally obtained weapons and armour are often
restricted or frowned upon, and can draw unwelcome
law enforcement scrutiny. The Central Supply
Catalogue provides additional guidance on permitting
and restrictions of categories of weaponry, these
are abbreviated as (C#) in the weapons and armour
banned column in the Law Level Effects: Weapons and
Economics table at the Law Level at which they are
completely banned for non-governmental purchase and
use. The Referee may choose to keep the Law Level
regarding weapons equal to the overall Law Level for
clarity and to account for pre-existing expectations, or
may choose to vary it as with other subcategories:

Weapons and Armour Law Level = Overall Law Level
+ 2D3-4 + DMs

PCR 0-3 DM-1
PCR 8+ DM+1

ECONOMIC LAW


Economic laws are often more regulatory than
actual criminal law and may be adjudicated by an
administrative or inquisitional process regardless of
general legal system. This category includes not only
financial crimes such as fraud and tax evasion but
also business regulation and reporting requirements,
permitting, zoning and licensing of commercial

world social characteristics



activities. At lower Law Levels, many activities
are unregulated or lightly regulated and financial
transactions are not audited unless they are large or
suspected of violating tax codes or being involved in
criminal activity. At higher Law Levels, the bureaucratic
requirements for performing any economic activity may
include prior approval, supervision, real-time auditing
and issuing of multiple licenses and permits.

**_Economic Law Level =_** Overall Law Level + 2D3-4 + DMs

CRIMINAL LAW


When someone commits what the government
considers a crime, they are subject to criminal law. This
law determines not only the extent of what is illegal but

the enforcement and legal proceedings that accompany
any violation of criminal law. The Crime Categories
section on page 169 provides examples of activities
that qualify for each level of crime. Violations of any
category could result in criminal law proceedings. At
Law Levels aboveC (12) nearly all legal proceedings
occur under the jurisdiction of the often arbitrary and
severe criminal legal system.

**_Criminal Law Level =_** Overall Law Level + 2D3-4 + DMs

Inquisitorial legal system DM+1

PRIVATE LAW


Some legal action is not initiated by the government
but by one individual against another. In this instance,
the legal action is covered by private law (sometimes
also called civil law). On some low Law Level worlds,
duelling or payment of blood money is an acceptable
way to settle a dispute – even over something that
would be considered a crime on more restrictive

world social characteristics

worlds. Private law covers agreements between two
parties, including contracts, dispute resolution, tort law
and private or government arbitration regulations. At
the highest Law Levels, the government takes over
these private or regulatory proceedings, treating them
no differently than criminal law or arbitrarily imposing
settlements or penalties upon the two feuding parties.

**_Private Law Level =_** Overall Law Level + 2D3-4 + DMs

Government 3, 5 or C DM-1

**PERSONAL RIGHTS**
This subcategory covers freedoms enjoyed by the
individual. These can vary based on government and
culture but generally cover the rights of expression,
association and privacy. This can include the right to
dissent, to membership in a political association, to
travel freely or worship a particular religion. As Law
Levels in this category become oppressive, even rights
to think freely or exist may be restricted or eliminated.

**_Personal Rights Law Level =_** Overall Law Level + 2D3-4

LAW LEVEL PROFILE


A detailed Law Level is recorded as follows:

**O-WECPR**

Where O = overall Law Level, W = weapons and
armour, E = economic law , C = criminal law, P =
private law, R = personal rights.

If Law Level is personal or territorial, differing groups
and differing territorial jurisdictions may have differing
Law Levels or differing laws and penalties noted.

CRIMINAL CONVICTION


In some cases, determination of guilt can depend
nearly as much on the legal system as to whether a
person is actually guilty of a crime. In addition to actual
evidence against the accused, factors such as legal
protections and procedures, potential corruption and
the skills of an advocate or prosecutor can factor into
conviction. The higher the Law Level, the less likely
the guilty will escape justice but also the more likely an
‘innocent’ – either someone who actually did not do it,
or someone that did not know watering flowers on a
Thursday was a crime – will be found guilty.

world social characteristics advocate is allowed

Additional DMs based on bribes or other interference in
the judicial system may also influence the conviction roll.

If a defendant is convicted, an appeal is possible on
a successful Difficult (10+) Advocate (1 week, EDU)
check. But in an inquisitorial judicial system, if the
Criminal Law Level is 7+, the government is able
to appeal an acquittal on an opposed Difficult (10+)
Advocate (1 hour, EDU) check. At the Referee’s
discretion, other types of legal systems may allow
the prosecution to appeal an acquittal, especially at
higher Law Levels. An appeal has the same chance
of conviction as the original roll but DMs may change
if an advocate manages to have evidence included or
excluded or additional external factors apply.

An admission of guilt or a plea bargain may allow a
negative DM on the sentencing roll.

**CRIME CATEGORIES**
Governments may disagree on what constitutes a
crime and how serious it is. The culture section will
delve into some of these peculiarities but in general
certain activities constitute a categorisation of crimes
ranging from atrocities to the trivial. On some worlds,
trivial or insignificant crimes may not even be codified,
on others they may be an excuse to confine a person
indefinitely. The enforcement column of the crime
severity is the Law Level at which punishment for
a crime is always pursued. At lower Law Levels,
a perpetrator may escape with a warning on a
successful Advocate or Persuasion check.

The severity of the crime influences the penalty
imposed. Where applicable, if the law broken generally
relates to a specific restriction on a column of the
Law Level Effects tables, the difference between the
Law Level under which the item or activity in question
is prohibited and the world’s applicable Law Level
determines the DM on the Legal Penalty table for the
crime, e.g., possession of a weapon that is banned at
Law Level 2 on a Law Level 6 world results in a DM of
6 - 2 = +4 on sentencing.

For general criminal activity crimes, the sentencing DM
is related to the crime’s severity as indicated on the
Crime Severity table. For instance, an armed robbery
on a world with Law Level 4 for criminal law would be
a moderate crime with a DM of the criminal Law Level
minus 2 or DM = 4 - 2 = +2. If, on that same world, the
economic Law Level was only 2, a moderate economic
crime such as major tax evasion would have a DM of
the economic Law Level minus 2 or DM = 2 - 2 = +0.

CRIMINAL LAW PENALTIES


Conviction of a crime, whether by trial or government
fiat, will lead to sentencing. Depending on the judicial
system, the convict may attempt to use Advocate
skill or another skill such as Persuade to influence
the result, although an attempt to bribe or otherwise
influence a judge by a non-judicial means should
involve an adventure and not just be a roll of the
dice. Any negative DMs the convict can acquire, plus
those from the severity of the crime or particulars of
the judicial system, are applied to the 2D roll on the
Criminal Penalty table.

Crime Severity

ECONOMIC LAW PENALTIES


Violations of economic laws are often handled by
administrative or specialised courts. Criminal violations
such as fraud or theft are considered under the criminal
justice system but many regulatory violations such
as improper permitting, licensing, failure to declare
profits or file paperwork are usually not handled in the
same manner as more serious crimes against people
or property. Only on worlds of extreme Law Levels
will these regulatory violations be considered by the
same methods as criminal law, although the Referee
should exercise some discretion: failure to comply with
zoning laws is one thing, illegal dumping of dangerous
chemicals is another matter, most likely criminal.

Economic Penalty
2D+DM Penalty
0- Dismissed or trivial
1–2 Fine of 1D × Cr1000 (per offense or ton of contraband)
3–4 Fine of 2D × Cr5000 (per offense or ton of contraband)
5–6 Fine of 1D × Cr10000 (per offense or ton of contraband)
7–8 Fine of 2D × Cr20000 (per offense or ton of contraband)
9–10 Imprisonment for 1D months or exile and a fine of 2D × Cr50000 (per offense or ton of contraband)
11–12 Imprisonment for 1D years or exile and a fine of 2D × Cr100000 (per offense or ton of contraband)
13–14 Imprisonment for 2D years or exile and a fine of 2D × Cr500000 (per offense or ton of contraband)
15+ Imprisonment for 4D years or exile and a fine of 2D × MCr1 (per offense or ton of contraband)*
*If the world’s Law Level is 9+ or above and allows the death penalty, it could be imposed on economic crimes at the
Referee’s discretion.

As with conviction, additional DMs based on bribes
or other interference in the judicial system may also
influence the conviction roll.

A result of exile is usually only applicable to Travellers
not native to the world and generally results in an
immediate and permanent expulsion from the world,
although the Referee may limit the period to a set
duration such as 10 years or allow the Traveller to
reapply for entry after such a time has passed.

Some legal systems may allow an automatic appeal of
a death sentence; others will carry it out the same day
as the conviction.

world social characteristics

The process for determining guilt is identical to that for
criminal law but fines are possibly more prevalent and
extensive than for criminal matters. Using the same
DMs (including the differences between economic Law
Level proscription and the actual offense) roll 2D on the
Economic Penalty table.

As with criminal proceedings, appeals may be possible,
although the state may usually only appeal in an
inquisitorial system.

**PRIVATE LAW PENALTIES**
Private law involves disputes between two parties. On
most worlds the government’s legal system acts as a
Referee in these matters but on the extremes of low and
high Law Level, the parties are either on their own or are
subject to the whims of the judicial system. Between the
extremes of duelling and government fiat, private law,
even in an administrative or traditional system, comes
down to a contest between two advocates. The offended
party or plaintiff must make an opposed Average (8+)
Advocate (INT or EDU) check, with DMs imposed by
the Referee based on any applicable conditions. If
punitive damages apply, the government may limit any
amount above actual damages caused, especially at
Law Level 7 or more. In generally, the higher the Effect
of a successful challenge, the greater the chances for,
and amount of, punitive damages that may apply. The
Economic Penalty table can act as guidance.

If an offended party fails to prove a case and
sometimes even if they do, they may be countersued
and will suffer a DM equal to the Effect of the failure (or
success) in such a case.

Zed Prime is a balkanised world. Its largest factions
have a Government code of B but the world’s overall
Law Level was determined to be 6 prior to delving
into the details of these factional governments. On a
balkanised world, the UWP Law Level is considered
to be that of the government nearest to or hosting the
starport. In this case, despite a Government code of B
generating a Law Level of6 (by rolling a 2) it is more
likely that one of the nations of the oligarch faction (Faction II), with a Government code of 3 has a Law
Level of6 (rolling a 10 is three times as likely as rolling
a 2), so the Referee arbitrarily assumes one of these
oligarch governments, the largest, is host to the world’s
downport (if any highports exist, they will be determined
later, in the starport section).

Moving through the process with an oligarch
government of CLS-ES-JS, the roll for system
of justice has no DM and rolling 6 results in an

adversarial justice system. A roll of 12 makes the
secondary justice system for economic and private
law inquisitional. A confederal system is always
territorial with regards to law but within each territory,
the roll for uniformity of law on 1D results in a 3 with
DM-1 for Government code of 3 equals 2, which is
personal: the law does not apply equally to everyone.
In a self-perpetuating oligarchy, it takes very limited
imagination to wonder who benefits from this. For
presumption of innocence, a 2D roll of 10 – the Law
Level(6) + 2 for adversarial = 6, a positive result, so
the justice system assumes a defendant is innocent.
The death penalty roll of 3 has no relevant DMs,
so there is no death penalty. The oligarch judicial
system is AIP-Y-N.

But moving on for Law Level subclassifications, the
Referee rolls 2D3-4 from an overall Law Level of 6
for each subcategory and adds any relevant DMs,
resulting in 6, 8, 8, 4, 6 – stricter laws for economic
and criminal malfeasance but looser restrictions on
private law. The Referee arbitrarily determines that
the oligarchs and their families get better breaks on
all of these by two Law Levels and offworlders (e.g.,
Travellers) operate at a two Law Level disadvantage in
all categories, with regular citizens subject to the rules
as written. The oligarch government with jurisdiction
of the startown of Zed Prime’s downport has a Law
Level of 6-68846 but for Travellers, it is 8-8AA68. For
the wealthy elite it is 4-46624 even before their highly
skilled hired advocates get involved and many of the
oligarchs’ private matters are handled outside the
courts, including infractions that might be treated as
criminal if they had been committed by others.

Repeating the process for the governorships results
in a separate overall Law Level rolled asA (10), an
adversarial law system, also with an inquisitorial
secondary system and a personal uniformity – by
chance exactly the same as the oligarchies. The
system also has a presumption of innocence but
does have a death penalty: AIP-Y-Y. While likely
based on the same original underlying principles,
this faction’s laws are stricter, profiled as A-989B9,
with relatively lenient economic rules equivalent to
those of the oligarchies – perhaps as the result of
some trade agreements. The Referee decides that as
with the oligarchies, the governorships have a Law
Level two levels more lenient for elites (in this case
government officials) and two levels more severe
for Travellers – at an adjusted base Law Level of C,
outsiders are not welcome at all – no wonder it is one
of the oligarchies that hosts the downport.

world social characteristics



SECONDARY WORLD LAW LEVELS


Secondary world Law Levels are based on Government
code and allegiance.

Case 1: Captive Governments
If the secondary world has a captive Government (6),
it will tend to have a Law Level equal to the owning
government or even higher. Roll 1D:

Captive Secondary World Law Levels
1D Result
1–2 Law Level is rerolled for a Government 6 world (2D-7 + 6)
3–4 Law Level is equal to the owning mainworld
government’s Law Level
5 Law Level is equal to the owning mainworld
government’s Law Level +1
6+ Law Level is equal to the owning mainworld
government’s Law Level + 1D

If the secondary world is a penal colony or
military base:

DM+1

Case 2: Government codes 1-3 under
Mainworld authority
If the secondary world is under the authority of a
mainworld government and has a Government code
1–3, the world may be subject to the same laws or its
own. Roll 2D minus the mainworld Government code:
•	 If the result is zero or negative, the Law Level of
the mainworld applies.
•	 If the result is positive, Roll 1D: on 1–3 the Law
Level of the world is equal to this 1D result; on
a 4–6, the Law Level is rolled again with the
secondary world’s Government code as the DM.

Case 3: Other
For all other Government codes, roll normally for
the Law Level based on the Government code. The
Referee may choose to apply a DM-1 to Law Level rolls
for worlds that host a freeport.

Zed Secundus has a Government code of 5 and is
entirely independent of Zed Prime. For case 3, a 2D
roll of 5 with a DM-1 for the freeport results in 5-7 + 5

- 1 = 2 for an overall Law Level of 2. The Referee can
proceed through details of the justice system if a trip to
Zed Secundus is in the Travellers’ future.

TECHNOLOGY


A world’s Tech Level represents the technology that is
commonly available and representative of the world’s
infrastructure. Depending on local population and
capabilities, it may represent what can be produced on
the world, or it might, especially on lower population
worlds, be more indicative of what technology is
imported and what locals can expect to purchase and
get repaired or replaced if it breaks down.

**DETERMINING UWP TECH LEVEL**
The UWP or overall Tech Level of a world is determined
by rolling 1D and adding DMs from the Tech Level
Modifiers table.

The overall Tech Level is a value typical of the area
around the starport and major cities. Some worlds may
have less developed regions, especially if balkanised.
Certain types of technology may be supported better
or worse on a particular world. A detailed Tech Level

world social characteristics



profile of a world covers subcategories relating to
quality of life, transportation, military and novelty
technologies, the latter being items not common but
occasionally present through imports, prototypes or
artefacts from a different era.

These subcategories have upper and lower
bounds based on the general UWP Tech Level.
Interdependencies prevent too broad a divergence, with
modifiers to the actual Tech Level subcategory value
based on a number of factors, including chance. A
Referee should not feel compelled to create Tech Level
subcategories for every world the Travellers might visit
but it is a useful tool to provide specific detail, allow for
anomalies in local product availability or to explain why
desert nomads are leading their pack animals across a
street crowded with autonomous vehicles and robots.
In the sections below, all fractional Tech Level values
are rounded down.

Common devices and their capabilities (except novelty)
are listed in the tables.

Prototype and early prototype items may be available
up to two Tech Levels lower than listed in the
tables but such objects should be rare, expensive
and unreliable. See page 10 of the Central Supply
Catalogue for prototech rules.

MINIMAL SUSTAINABLE TECH LEVELS


Many worlds are hostile enough to require
technology to survive. In general, a world cannot
sustain a population unless it meets minimum Tech
Level limits based on environment. In some cases,
the world can survive at one or two Tech Levels
lower than the limits indicated in the Tech Level
and Environment table but use of such prototype or

jury-rigged equipment makes most of these worlds
economically unviable and prone to the dangers
of life support failures. These Tech Level limits
apply more strictly to both the high common and
environment Tech Level subcategories but the low
common Tech Level should be no more than two
below this minimum as well for the world to prosper.

Tech Level and Environment

Environment Minimum Tech Level
Atmosphere 0, 1 or A 8
Atmosphere 2, 3, D or E 5
Atmosphere 4, 7 or 9 3
Atmosphere B 9
Atmosphere C 10
Atmosphere G or H 14
Habitability rating 3–7 3
Habitability rating 1–2 5
Habitability rating 0 8

Atmosphere F has a minimum requirement of at least
TL8, possibly TL10 or more depending on specific
conditions. If multiple factors apply to a world, the
highest minimum Tech Level applies.

**TECH LEVEL MODIFIERS (TLM)**
A Tech Level modifier (TLM) 2D roll applies to each
subcategory, randomising differences between the
subcategories. When a Tech Level formula specifies
adding a modifier with the notation TLM, determine
the modifier using the following table:

**Tech Level Modifier (TLM)**

2 -3
3 -2

4 -1

5 0

7 0
8 0

TECH LEVEL BOUNDS


Each of the various Tech Level subcategories has
defined upper and lower bounds. If any subcategory
result is outside these bounds, the subcategory is
instead equal to the bound it violated. All bounds are
rounded down.

HIGH AND LOW COMMON TECH LEVELS


For most items, the highest technology generally
available on a world is its high common Tech Level.
This is always the same as the overall Tech Level
specified in the world’s UWP. Unless specified
otherwise, is always the Tech Level used as a basis
for Tech Level DMs.

**_High Common TL =_** UWP TL

The low common Tech Level is the floor Tech Level
of current capabilities and equipment. It does not
preclude the continued operation of lower tech
items but anything newly purchased or assembled
would be built at no less than the low common Tech
Level standard, unless it was an attempt to make an
authentically-produced copy of an antique. The low
common Tech Level is equal to:

**_Low Common TL =_** High Common TL + TLM + DMs

Upper bound: High Common TL
Lower bound: High Common TL ÷ 2

Population 1–5 DM+1
Population 9+ DM-1
Government 0, 6, D or E DM-1
Government 5 DM+1
Government 7 DM-2
PCR 0-2 DM-1
PCR 7+ DM+1

BALKANISED GOVERNMENT TECH LEVELS


If a world has a balkanised government, any particular
government on the world could have a high common
TL equal to a value between the world’s high and low
common values. For all nations except the one hosting
or adjacent to the starport:

Non-starport hosting nation High Common TL =
World High Common TL - 2 + TLM + DMs

world social characteristics



UPPER AND LOWER TECH LEVELS


Many procedures for determining the upper
bounds of Tech Levels for various subcategories
of technology allow for these Tech Levels to
increase above the listed UWP Tech Level and
potentially above the local polity maximums
established within a certain universe. For
instance, TL15 is the Charted Space maximum
for the Third Imperium in 1105. The Imperial-wide upper bounds limit for any Tech Level
subcategory is one greater than the overall
maximum for that polity, e.g., in the Third
Imperium in the year 1105, the global upper
bounds would be TL16. This Tech Level limit
does not apply to the novelty TL upper bounds
but the Referee should have some rationale
for the existence of rare very high technology
items. In Charted Space, these are often Ancient
artifacts and subject to government confiscation
if discovered, whether they still function or not.

In some universes, certain governments or regions
may have a lower bound for Tech Level. This could
result from a close-knit community with a broad or
long-standing distribution of technology or from a
milieu where settlements are mostly new outposts
established and supported by a homeworld. In
these cases, high technology may be supported
by fabricators even on low population or isolated
worlds. In general, as a region matures and
expands, some societies will fall behind or regress
in technology, either by circumstance or choice.
Regardless of the DMs for determining Tech
Levels, Referees may set and/or override these
limits as they see fit.

Upper bound: world High Common TL
Lower bound: world Low Common TL

Government 5 DM+2
Government 0, 6, D or E DM-2

Non-starport hosting nation Low Common TL =

QUALITY OF LIFE TECH LEVEL SUBCATEGORIES


The five quality of life Tech Level subcategories cover
the basics of civilisation on a world. The subcategories
are energy, electronics, manufacturing, medical and
environmental. These are determined separately with
the following formulas:

Energy Tech Level
This subcategory determines the devices available on a
world to produce or store energy.

**_Energy TL =_** High Common TL + TLM + DMs

Upper bound: High Common TL × 1.2
Lower bound: High Common TL ÷ 2

Population 9+ DM +1
Industrial DM +1

Electronics Tech Level
This broad subcategory covers available electronic
equipment ranging from computers (mechanical at
lower Tech Levels), to sensors, to communications
devices and robots.

**_Electronics TL =_** High Common TL + TLM + DMs

Upper bound: Energy TL + 1
Lower bound: Energy TL - 3

Population 1–5 DM+1
Population 9+ DM-1
Industrial DM+1

Manufacturing Tech Level
The industrial and production capabilities of a world are
based on this subcategory.

**_Manufacturing TL =_** High Common TL + TLM + DMs

Upper bound: greater of Energy TL or Electronics TL
Lower bound: Electronics TL - 2

world social characteristics


Population 1-6 DM-1
Population 8+ DM+1
Industrial DM+1

Medical Tech Level
A world’s medical practices can vary greatly based on the
knowledge of biology and access to enabling technology.

**_Medical TL =_** Electronics TL + TLM + DMs

Upper bound: Electronics TL
Lower bound: The higher of 0 or the system’s starport
class Tech Level DM: 6 for A, 4 for B and 2 for C.

Rich DM+1
Poor DM-1

Environmental Tech Level
The environmental subcategory covers the living
conditions and construction capabilities of a world. The
minimal sustainable Tech Level is tied to this subcategory,
as are the Unusual City types on page 154. If the world’s
habitability rating is not computed, this subcategory can
be set to the minimum sustainable level.

**_Environmental TL =_** Manufacturing TL + TLM + DMs

Upper bound: Energy TL
Lower bound: Energy TL - 5

Habitability rating is less
than 8

DM = 8-Habitability Rating

**TRANSPORTATION TECH LEVEL SUBCATEGORIES**
Transportation can occur by land, sea, air or
space. Obviously, a world with no water has no
sea transportation and one without a substantial
atmosphere will not develop air transportation until
the advent of rockets or grav vehicles. Eventually,
land, sea and air transportation merges as grav
technology becomes ubiquitous at TL10 or 11.
Although grav vehicles are technically able to reach
orbit, they are rarely capable of interplanetary flight
and definitely incapable of interstellar flight, so a
distinction between air and space travels persists
even at higher Tech Levels.

Land Transport Tech Level
Travel over land begins with foot and animal power
and continues over roads, rails and terrain until
supplanted by grav lifter technology. Even worlds with
no land surface may have short-ranged vehicles that
travel within their cities.

**_Land Transport TL =_** Energy TL + TLM + DMs

Upper bound: Energy TL
Lower bound: Electronics TL - 5

HydrographicsA (10) DM-1
PCR 0–2 DM+1

Water Transport Tech Level
Water transport is reliant on a navigable liquid
somewhere on the world’s surface or in some exotic
location such as subterranean oceans under ice or rock.

**_Water Transport TL =_** Energy TL + TLM + DMs

Upper bound: Energy TL
Lower bound: Electronics TL - 5, or 0 if
Hydrographics = 0

Hydrographics 0 DM-2
Hydrographics 8 DM+1
Hydrographics 9+ DM+2
PCR 0–2 DM+1

Air Transport TL
At lower Tech Levels air transport is impossible or
impractical. Grav vehicles begin to be possible at TL8
and become dominant by TL10 or 11 regardless of
atmosphere, although special circumstances such
as a highly corrosive atmosphere which requires
subterranean rail links between cities may contradict
this. The upper bound for air travel is normally the
world’s energy TL, although a Referee may allow
worlds with dense or very dense atmospheres to use
energy TL+1 as an upper bound. The lower bound
is generally energy TL - 5, although worlds without
a viable atmosphere can only use land or space
transportation prior to TL8. For those worlds, the lower
bound and actual air transport TL are both 0.

Air Transport TL* = Energy TL + TLM + DMs
*Automatically 0 if Atmosphere 0 and TL 5-

world social characteristics



Upper bound: Energy TL but see text above
Lower bound: Electronics TL - 5, but see text above

Atmosphere 0–3, or E and TL0–7 DM-2
Atmosphere 4 or 5, and TL0–7 DM-1
Atmosphere 4 or 5, and TL0–7 DM+1

Space Transport Tech Level
Spaceflight covers surface to orbit, interplanetary and
interstellar capabilities. Regardless of Tech Level, at
the Referee’s discretion, the world has no access to
jump drive technology if its starport is not Class A; this
is more likely to be true in more isolated regions. In
regions closer to civilisation, a world with TL9+ and
a Class B starport (or possibly worse) may be able
to build starships at a government or military-owned
shipyard not associated with the starport but such ships
would not be available for commercial purchase.

**_Space Transport TL =_** Manufacturing TL + TLM + DMs

Upper bound: lesser of Energy TL or Manufacturing TL
Lower bound: lesser of Energy TL - 3 or
Manufacturing TL - 3

Size 0, S, or 1 DM+2
Population 1–5 DM-1
Population 9+ DM+1
Starport Class A DM+2
Starport Class B DM+1

In isolated regions, the Referee may wish to set a
minimum space transport TL requirement for a world
to have a Class A or Class B starport and to keep
associated DMs for its UWP TL. In such a situation,
a Class A should have at least TL9 and a Class B at
least TL8 or two lower (7 and 6, respectively) if allowing
for early prototype designs. If the world cannot meet
those limits, the ports can be downgraded and the Tech
Levels all recomputed – this may result in a downward
spiral with a world’s population relegated to a primitive
existence or extinction. For more suggestion on
isolation limits, the Referee can reference page 21 of
the Sector Construction Guide.

MILITARY TECH LEVEL SUBCATEGORIES


Military technology is a subset of technologies
presented in the quality of life and transportation
sections but as with the weapon limitations in the
Law Level subcategories, they are worth detailing
separately as they may impact a Traveller campaign in
more significant ways than the workings of solar farms
and industrial facilities. military technology has two
subcategories: personal military and heavy military.

Personal Military Tech Level
Weapons and armour that can be carried or worn,
from knives and discreet cloth armour to fusion
guns and battle dress are all covered by personal
military technology. These are the items capable of
being manufactured or supported locally. Even if the
Travellers cannot purchase such things, they may
encounter those so equipped.

**_Personal Military TL =_** Manufacturing TL + TLM + DMs

Upper bound: Electronics TL
Lower bound: 0, or Manufacturing TL if the weapons
and armour Law Level = 0

Government 0 or 7 DM+2
Law Level 0 or D+ DM+2
Law Level 1-4, or 9–C DM+1

world social characteristics

On a world with Government code of 7, the DM+2 applies
to all nations, regardless of their local government, but
any Population or Law Level DMs are specific to nations.

Heavy Military Tech Level
The equipment in the category of heavy military
includes armoured vehicles and any weapons mounted
upon them and larger weapons including artillery,
missiles, heavy energy weapons and weapons of mass
destruction. These are most likely only available to the
armed forces of a world or licensed mercenary units.

**_Heavy Military TL =_** Manufacturing TL + TLM +DMs

Upper bound: Manufacturing TL
Lower bound: 0

Population 1-6 DM-1
Population 8+ DM+1
Government 7, A, B or F DM+2
Law Level D+ DM+2
Industrial DM+1

On a world with Government code 7, this government
DM applies regardless of individual Government codes
but all other DMs including any additional Government
code DM are specific to nations.

Novelty Tech Level Subcategory
Higher Tech Level novelty items sometimes exist on
a world, often as a result of imports, local prototyping
or some unique circumstances such as the previous
existence of a local higher Tech Level culture. Novelty
items do not have bounds in a normal sense. They
may have availability DM, but since they are not locally
manufactured, at least not in bulk, they do not have set
limits. Several factors control the setting of the novelty
Tech Level including:
•	 For worlds that do not have a Class X starport and
are in or near interstellar civilisations, the Tech Level
of novelty items is at least equal to the highest Tech
Level of any industrial or rich worlds with Class A
starports within the same subsector or six parsecs.
•	 Local industry often creates prototypes or early
prototypes of ‘cutting edge’ items not available in
commercial qualities. The novelty Tech Level for
these locally produced items of any subcategory can
be equal to the Tech Level of the highest subcategory
TL. These items are usually only available at
exorbitant prices, are often of questionable reliability
and only available up to two Tech Levels above any
regional maximum upper bound.

•	 A previous fallen culture, either recent or ancient,
may have relic technology. These items will become
increasingly rare with age and usually do not include
an instruction or repair manual, so reliability and
usage can become an adventure for the Traveller.
•	 A world that otherwise does not have a Tech Level
high enough to reach the minimal sustainable
Tech Level should have relic technology at least
advanced enough to explain its survival, even if it
is a prototype developed at two Tech Levels less
than normally required. For instance, a vacuum
world, which would normally require TL8, should
have at least some access to TL6 early prototypes
of TL8 equipment, even if their high common
Tech Level was only TL2 and the world had no
access to imports; the locals might have only rote
or ritual understanding of how to keep the ‘Great
Machine of the Tunnels’ operating and no method
to duplicate it but it would still exist.

To summarise:
Novelty Tech Level = Highest of nearby rich or
industrial Class A port world, or Highest subcategory
Tech Level, or Previous culture Tech Level, or
Survivable early prototype tech required to meeting
environmental limits

TECH LEVEL PROFILE


The full technology profile of a world is a string of eHex
Tech Level values arranged as the common high and
low Tech Levels, followed by subcategories for quality of
life, transportation, military and the novelty Tech Level:

**_Tech Level Profile =_** H-L-QQQQQ-TTTT-MM-N

Zed Prime has a UWP TL of 8. Its habitability rating
of 7 imposes a requirement of TL3 for its minimum
sustainable Tech Level; this is not an issue. The UWP
TL becomes the high common TL. The low common
TL is bound between 8 and 8 ÷ 2 = 4. The Government
code of 7 provides a DM-2 to this roll, which applies to
the world as a whole. A 2D roll of 7 on the TLM chart
provides no DM, so the low common TL for the world
is 8 + 0 - 2 = 6. The various nations of Zed Prime could
have a high common TL of 6–8, but the low common is
no lower than 6. The rest of this example will proceed
using the oligarch nation closest to the starport (faction
II, nation I or II.I – it should have a name – the Referee
picks ‘Zenobia’ to stick with the ‘Z’ theme), which has
a PGL of 636 – but for population Tech Level DMs, it
uses world’s Population Code of 7.

world social characteristics



Rolling for Zenobia’s quality of life TL subcategories,
energy TL can be as high as 8 × 1.2 = 9.6, rounded
down to 9 or as low as 8 ÷ 2 = 4. With no DMs but the
TLM (a 5 rolled for no random DM), the energy TL is
equal to TL8. electronics TL is limited to the energy TL
of 8 + 1 and can be as low as 8 - 3 = 5; only the TLM
applies (a roll of 10 results in a +1): this makes the
electronics TL9. Next, manufacturing TL is bound by 9
and 7 and has only a TLM (6 = 0 ) DM; it is therefore
the same as the high common TL of 8. Medical is
bound by electronics (TL9) and the starport-derived
minimum (Class C = 2). Also, the world is categorised
as rich, providing a DM+1 in addition to the TLM roll (10 = +1) the result would be TL10, but it is limited
to TL9, because it is bound by the electronics TL.
Environmental TL is bound to 8 and 3, with the DM for
habitability rating being 8 - 7 = DM+1 but the TLM roll is
a 3 for DM-2, so environmental TL is only TL7.

For transportation TLs, Land transport TL is bound at 8
and 4 with just the TLM, a 4, providing a DM-1, so land
transport TL is also only TL7. Sea transport TL can be
between 8 and 4 with a TLM roll of 10 giving +1, but it
is still limited by energy to TL8. Air transport TL has no
atmosphere-related DMs, so it has a TL just equivalent
to its energy TL value with a possible TLM (none)
and becomes TL8 – so at least air/rafts are present,
even if boats and cars stick to the world’s roads and
waterways. Space transport TL is bound by 8 and 5
and is rolled as TL8.

Personal military TL is bound by 9 and 0. The local
government benefits from the balkanised status of the
world, a DM+2, and a TLM gives it +1, which would be
TL11 but it is bound to TL9 maximum. Heavy military
gains DM+2 but it is bound by 8 and 0, after the TLM
roll of 7, it remains TL8.

Finally, the novelty TL. The Referee rules that a TL12
world exists nearby, and imports do occur. If that world
had not been present, the multiple local subcategories
of TL9 could produce some TL9 prototypes of other
subcategory items. The Referee rules no previous
local culture has left functioning higher tech relics for
recovery. So, the novelty TL stands at TL12 or C. The
Tech Level profile for Zed Prime is 8-6-89897-7888-98-C. This applies to Zenobia, the nation nearest the
starport. Other nations may have a slightly different,
often lower, TL profile, although none would have a
high common or low common TL outside the range of
6 – 8. When determined, the profile of the governorship
faction’s largest nation – the Referee calls it ‘Zeno’ – is
7-6-77765-7777-77-C, or 7 overall.

SECONDARY WORLD TECH LEVELS


The Tech Level of secondary worlds depends on their
ownership and purpose. Those owned by a mainworld
or a nation or organisation on a mainworld have Tech
Levels associated with the owner. An independent
secondary world can have an entirely different Tech
Level but an overall guideline for all secondary
worlds is that they should have at least high enough
technology to be survivable. Use of prototype or relic
technology may keep a mainworld alive but it will rarely
keep a secondary world outpost functional, unless the
Referee explicitly allows for it. The Secondary World
Tech Level Guidelines table provides parameters for
different types of secondary world settlements.

If a secondary world requires a minimal sustainable
Tech Level that is greater than the higher of the
mainworld’s Tech Level or its environmental TL
subcategory, then the secondary world should probably
be considered uninhabited, or perhaps the site of a
failed or relic outpost ruin. If desired, the Referee can
create detailed TL subcategories for any secondary
world. Except in the case of freeports, the upper
bound for all subcategories should be the mainworld’s
subcategory TL value.

Secondary World Tech Level Guidelines
Secondary World Tech Level Guidelines
Colony Higher of mainworld TL-1 or minimal sustainable Tech Level
Farming Higher of mainworld TL-1 or minimal sustainable Tech Level
Freeport Determined independently from mainworld but at least minimal sustainable Tech Level
Military Base Mainworld TL
Mining Facility Higher of mainworld TL or minimal sustainable Tech Level
Penal Colony Higher of mainworld TL-1 or minimal sustainable Tech Level
Research Base Mainworld TL
All others Higher of mainworld TL-1 or minimal sustainable Tech Level
world social characteristics

Zed Secundus is a freeport with a UWP of C340552-

9. Its habitability rating is 1 so its minimal sustainable
Tech Level is 5. It can follow the standard procedures
for determining TL subcategories independently of
the mainworld. With bounds and DMs, completing the
procedures in the above sections results in a Tech
_Level profile of 9-9-99879-9797-97-C. The world is_
relatively lacking in local medical and space transport
technology and, not surprisingly, water transport and
has a weak industrial base.

CULTURE


In even the most integrated interstellar polity, space
travel is an expensive opportunity for the few and
information delays between just the nearest stars are
measured in weeks. Settlers of a world often come
from a subset of a homeworld’s population, whether a
specific cultural group or just those predisposed to new
challenges. Any world’s culture begins to acquire unique
traits, sometimes almost immediately but certainly
within decades, both internally and in the way its people
interact with outsiders. Unsurprisingly, the homeworlds
of different sophont species will have their own unique
and sometimes inexplicable cultures but the same
can happen among human colonies within just a few
generations. The Cultural Differences table on page 254
of the Traveller Core Rulebook provides an overview of
ways a culture can become unique and its descriptions
are broad enough to allow for countless variations.

The procedures in this section do not supplant or
minimise the value of this table but are meant to
categorise the culture of a world in a manner suitable
to the collection and organisation of social data from
a large number of worlds in a manner that bridges a
simple description with specific values. Where relevant,
the values of cultural traits in this section will cross-reference potentially relevant cultural characteristics
from the Cultural Differences table. The Referee can
choose to alter a roll on a trait to match pre-existing
cultural attributes, or to use the descriptions provided in
the table to portray the culture of a world.

All of the traits below are recorded as eHex- values.
Worlds with no population have values of 0 for all
cultural traits but inhabited worlds will have a minimum
value of 1 for each trait.

**USING CULTURE FOR DMS**
The values of the cultural characteristics can be the
basis of DMs for certain social interactions, although
whether a positive or negative DM applies depends
greatly on the situation. When using cultural traits,
appropriate DMs are:

Potential Cultural Trait DMs
Trait value Possible + DM
1–2 2
3–5 1
6–8 0
9–B (11) 1
C–E (12–14) 2
F–H (15–17) 3
J+ (18+) 4

The following sections describe each cultural trait in
greater detail.

Diversity
Some worlds have a single culture or set of beliefs;
others value diversity or have come to be diverse
through social or physical separation. Regardless of
the reason, the diversity trait is a measurement of the
degree of diversity, from low to high. To determine a
world’s diversity cultural trait:

**_Diversity =_** 2D + DMs

Population 1–5 DM-2
Population 9+ DM+2
Government 0–2 DM+1
Government 7 DM+4
Government D–F DM-4
Law Level 0–4 DM+1
Law Level A+ DM-1
PCR 0–3 DM+1
PCR 7–9 DM-2

Diversity values of 3 or less indicate a monolithic
culture while those ofC (12) or more indicate diversity
to the point where no culture is considered dominant or
representative of the whole world.

On balkanised worlds, a result ofC (12) or greater
indicates divergence among nations and the Referee
may decide to develop completely different cultural
profiles for each faction or nation based on their
individual PGL values. In this case, the Referee
should reroll a diversity value for each nation without
the modifier for Government code 7. If a single set of
cultural values is recorded for a balkanised world, it
is assumed to apply to the nation hosting or adjacent
to the starport.

Potentially Relevant Cultural Differences: Any result
may be relevant. Roll diversity÷4 number of times (rounding as desired) for various Cultural Differences of
diverse subpopulations.

Xenophilia
Some worlds are open to offworld visitors and
influences, others are opposed to contact with
foreign ideas or people. Acceptance ranges from low (xenophobic) to high (xenophilic) and can vary based
on numerous cultural factors, although contact with
other worlds through interstellar trade and travel tends
to limit the extremes of xenophobia, assuming those
relationships are not hostile or disruptive. To determine
a world’s xenophilia trait:

**_Xenophilia =_** 2D + DMs

Population 1–5 DM-1
Population 9+ DM+2
Government D or E DM-2
Law Level A+ DM-2
Starport A DM+2
Starport B DM+1
Starport D DM-1
Starport E DM-2
Starport X DM-4
Diversity 1–3 DM-2
Diversity C+ DM+1

A value of 9+ equals a welcoming attitude to outside
visitors and ideas. A result of 3 or less indicates
active xenophobia.

Potentially Relevant Cultural Differences: 16:
Xenophobic and 23: Liberal map fairly directly to
xenophilia. Other related cultural characteristics
include 15: Conservative, 25: Influenced, 36:
Nexus, 41: Tourist Attraction, 51: Unusual Custom:
Offworlders, 52: Unusual Custom: Starport and 65:
Unusual Custom: Travel.

Uniqueness
As a world’s culture evolves, it may vary from interstellar
norms in peculiar ways. A culture with low uniqueness
may be almost indistinguishable from other worlds
in terms of language, dress, behaviour, coffee shops
or other cultural touchpoints. A highly unique culture
may diverge from neighbouring worlds or from an

encompassing interstellar polity to the point where a
visitor will have no cultural touchpoints and has a high
probability of being misunderstood or inadvertently
violating some tradition or law. To determine uniqueness:

**_Uniqueness =_** 2D + DMs

Starport A DM-2
Starport B DM-1
Starport D DM+1
Starport E DM+2
Starport X DM+4
Diversity 1–3 DM+2
Xenophilia 9–B DM-1
Xenophilia C+ DM-2

Potentially Relevant Cultural Differences: Any
custom especially if caried to extremes can apply to
uniqueness with a special emphasis on 21: Taboo and
the 51–66 Unusual Customs series.

Symbology
Certain symbols may hold cultural importance for a
society. These can range from the concrete: statues,
flags, colours, clothing, architectural styles, to the
abstract: religions, numerology, social groups, secret
societies. A low symbology trait value indicates an
emphasis on easily discernible concrete symbols of a
world’s culture. A high symbology score indicates more
abstract and less apparent – although no less important
to the cultural adherent – symbols. The symbology trait
does not necessarily correlate to the strength of belief
or adherence to a symbol but to its appearance. The
traits of uniqueness, xenophilia and diversity, in that
order, apply to how important these symbols are to a
culture and potentially what reaction will result from
intentional or inadvertent desecration of such symbols.
To determine symbology:

**_Symbology =_** 2D + DMs

Government D or E DM+2
TL 0–1 DM-3
TL 2–3 DM-1
TL 9–11 DM+2
TL12+ DM+4

**Potentially Relevant Cultural Differences:** Any
custom could apply to symbology but especially
relevant characteristics include 12: Religious, 14:
Ritualised, 21: Taboo, 32: Remnant, 44: Obsessed, 45:
Fashion And The 51–66 Unusual Customs Series.

Cohesion
Some cultures focus on the individual, others on the
group. A culture with low cohesion is an individualistic
society, where the person is more important than the
group. A culture with high cohesion is a collectivist or
communal society, putting the wellbeing of groups,
whether familial, social, caste or ethnic ahead of the
needs of the individual. To determine cohesion:

**_Cohesion =_** 2D + DMs

Government 3 or C DM+2
Government 5, 6 or 9 DM+1
Law Level 0–2 DM-2
Law Level A+ DM+2
PCR 0–3 DM-2
PCR 7+ DM+2
Diversity 1–2 DM+4
Diversity 3–5 DM+2
Diversity 9–B DM-2
Diversity C+ DM-4

**Potentially Relevant Cultural Differences:** Any
custom could relate to cohesion, depending on its
value. a low cohesion is particularly applicable to
23: Liberal. A high cohesion can be compatible with
14: Ritualised, 15: Conservative and 56: Unusual
Customs: Social Standings.

Progressiveness
Some cultures are set in their ways or even decaying,
while others are obsessed with forward-looking
objectives, looking to improve their societies,
economies and technologies. Progressiveness is a
measure of this cultural trait. Worlds of progressiveness
3 or less are in moribund decay, those of less than 6
are rather conservative and those of 9 or above are
moving forward. A progressiveness value ofC (12) or
more indicates a society that values change for its own
sake and is willing to experiment with new ideas and
technology with little concern for what came before. To
determine progressiveness:

**_Progressiveness =_** 2D + DMs

Population 6–8 DM-1
Population 9+ DM-2
Government 5 DM+1
Government B DM-2
Government D or E DM-6

Xenophilia 1–5 DM-1
Xenophilia 9+ DM+2
Cohesion 1–5 DM+2

Potentially Relevant Cultural Differences: 14:
Ritualised, 15: Conservative, 21: Taboo, 23: Liberal,
32: Remnant, 33: Degenerate, 34: Progressive, 36:
Nexus, 54: Unusual Custom: Technology, 56: Unusual
Custom: Social Standing are most relevant, although
others can apply.

Expansionism
A culture’s desire to expand itself is expressed in the
expansionism trait. This may be a desire to spread
a political philosophy or a religion or the aspiration
of conquest to grow an empire. A culture with low
expansionism values is more likely to be one with
high xenophilia that does not have a vested interest
in maintaining its current culture, even within its own
society. An expansionism value of 9 or more actively
promotes its culture through diplomats, missionaries
and teachers. An expansionism value of C+ indicates
a willingness to use coercion to convert others to their
culture. To determine expansionism:

**_Expansionism =_** 2D + DMs

Government A or C+ DM+2
Diversity 1–3 DM+3
Diversity C+ DM-3
Xenophilia 1–5 DM+1
Xenophilia 9+ DM-2

Potentially Relevant Cultural Differences: 16:
Xenophobic, 25: Influenced, 26: Fusion, 34: Progressive,
35: Recovering, 36: Nexus and 44: Obsessed, along
with any other aspect of a world’s culture.

world social characteristics



Militancy
The militancy of a culture as a whole can express
itself in different ways. It may relate to a propensity for
criminal violence and/or police response in the society,
a chauvinism towards the culture and against those
who oppose it or in literal militancy, both in the form
of defensive military preparation and in expansionist
behaviour. A combination of high expansionism and
high militancy can result in a culture bent on conquest
but aggression can express itself internally and
defensively as well. To determine militancy:

**_Militancy =_** 2D + DMs

Government A+ DM+3
Law Level 9–B DM+1
Law Level C+ DM+2
Xenophilia 1–5 DM+1
Xenophilia 9+ DM-2
Expansionism 1–5 DM-1
Expansionism 9–B DM+1
Expansionism C+ DM+2

Potentially Relevant Cultural Differences: 14:
Ritualised, 31: Barbaric, 33: Degenerate, 42: Violent,
43: Peaceful and 46: At War are the most relevant
cultural characteristics of an especially aggressive or
passive culture.

CULTURAL PROFILE


The full cultural profile of a world is a string of eHex trait
values arranged in the order presented in this section as:

DXUS-CPEM

Where D = diversity, X = xenophilia, U = uniqueness, S
= symbology, C = cohesion, P = progressiveness, E =
expansionism and M = militancy.

T5 CULTURAL EXTENSION CONVERSION
The first four cultural values functionally correspond
to the T5 Cultural Extension or Cx codes of HASS (Heterogeneity, Acceptance, Strangeness and
Symbols) which are displayed on Travellermap. Note
that differing procedures will result in different bounds
for some of these values. To convert the values created
in this book to T5 equivalents:
•	 Diversity equals Heterogeneity but is bound by
the Population code ±5; values exceeding these
bounds should be converted to Population-5 or
Population+5, respectively.

•	 Xenophilia equals Acceptance but Acceptance is
bound by Importance + Population code ±5; values
exceeding these bounds should be converted to
Importance + Population ±5 accordingly.
•	 Uniqueness translates into a Strangeness value
between 0 andA (10); multiply the uniqueness
value by ⅔ and round up to the nearest number.
•	 Symbology equals Symbols but is bounded by
TL ±5; values exceeding these bounds should be
converted to TL-5 or TL+5, respectively.

In all cases, worlds with Population code 0 have T5
Cultural values of 0 and populated worlds have a value
of at least 1.

CULTURAL SUMMARY


The terms and coding of values for cultural traits can
be slightly obscure, partially in a response to trying
to be consistent with other cultural rating systems.
To help a Referee or Traveller looking at a cultural
profile the Cultural Summary Trait Summary table can
provide a quick reference to what the low and high
values of each trait represent.

Cultural Trait Summary
Trait Code Low Value High Value
Diversity D Monolithic Multicultural
Xenophilia X Xenophobic Xenophilic
Uniqueness U Normal Obscure
Symbology S Concrete Abstract
Cohesion C Individualistic Collective
Progressiveness P Reactionary Radical
Expansionism E Passive Expansionistic
Militancy M Peaceful Militant

As Zed Prime is a balkanised world, its culture can be
considered as a whole or by faction or nation. A quick
way to determine which approach is most appropriate
is to roll for the first cultural trait of diversity. Using the
population and government of the whole planet and its
PCR of 3 results in a +5 DM to the 2D roll of 7, which
indicates 12, a very diverse value. Still, the Referee
chooses to base the cultures on the two factions:
governorships and oligarchies, and since the starport
is located adjacent to an oligarch nation, that is the
example detailed here.

The oligarchy PGL is 636. Rolling again for diversity –
and by choice ignoring the PCR – with a DM of -1 for
population, the result is a 6. Next, xenophilia has no
DMs for this factional or national culture and the 2D roll
is a 9, indicating a fairly welcoming society. Uniqueness
world social characteristics

_has DM-1 for xenophilia and is rolled as a 10 modified_
to 9, so the culture is distinct from that of interstellar
society but not incomprehensible. Symbology receives
a DM+1 from uniqueness modifying a roll of 8 to 9, so
symbols are more abstract than concrete: not so much
colourful local costumes as colourful local customs.

Cohesion has no DMs but a roll of 11 indicates a
culture that places most of its emphasis on the group.
Progressiveness has a net DM-1 for a 2D roll of
7-1 = 6, indicating a slightly conservative outlook.
Expansionism has a DM-2 from xenophilia, resulting in
a score of 5, meaning locals are more likely to accept
someone’s culture than to try to impose it on outsiders
_and finally, militancy has a total DM-3, so the 2D roll
of 9 becomes a 6. The cultural profile for Zed Primes_
oligarchies is 6999-B656. The Referee can pick or roll
on the Traveller Core Rulebook’s _Cultural Differences_
table but instead both chooses 56: Unusual Customs:
Social Standings as a basis of the culture and randomly
rolls 15: Conservative, but decides this is inappropriate (or at least slightly redundant) and instead rolls again
for 24: Honourable.

Repeating the process for faction I, the non-charismatic
dictator governorships of PGL 6BA, the result is
7 57A-B65C, resulting in a rather cliquish police state
with the same underlying collectivist culture. The
Referee decides to use the 15: Conservative roll from
the other government for this culture and rather than
roll, also picks 33: Degenerate to indicate a society
ready to challenge its leadership held at bay by
increasingly harsh measures.

**RELIGION IN TRAVELLER**
The section on culture does not deal directly with
religion. Religion exists in Traveller – two entire
government codes are explicitly religious. However
religions themselves are not necessarily tied to a
specific world. They may be a world religion or a
variation of a broader faith and multiple faiths may exist
on a world, harmoniously or not. Just as this book does
not concern itself directly with star-spanning polities,
it does not concern itself directly with star-spanning
religions nor with vast interstellar megacorporations.
Other books may cover the creation and classification
of religions and corporations in detail. The Sector
Construction Guide has some coverage of larger
polities and sophont species and more detail may
follow in some other future publication.

In the meantime, the cultural descriptions and
tendencies are literally agnostic to religion. Any cultural
value can be the result of a religious belief or practice
and the Referee is free to treat them as such if desired.

SECONDARY WORLD CULTURES


The culture of a secondary world may correspond
to that of the mainworld or diverge in one or more
aspects. Referees wishing to create separate cultures
for secondary worlds should consider the purpose
of the settlement. If it is independent, it deserves its
own cultural profile. If it is owned and operated by the
mainworld it is less likely to be divergent, although a
military base by definition may be more aggressive in
culture than the civilisation as a whole and a research
base may have staff with rather radical ideas that are
only tolerated in exceptional people in an isolated
environment. The Referee could choose to tweak just
one aspect of the culture or roll randomly for all or as
many of them as the needs of an adventure require.

As Zed Secundus is entirely independent it gets its own
culture based on its UWP of C340552-9. The result
of the rolls is 159D-5A97, a monolithic, rather insular,
difficult to decipher but individualistic forward-looking
culture – perhaps one that plans on expanding to other
moons and worlds in the system, someday challenging
the status of Zed Prime as the mainworld.

ECONOMICS


A world’s influence and importance are tied directly or
indirectly to its wealth. Many factors determine not only
a world’s total wealth but how it is distributed among
its population and how efficiently all the resources

world social characteristics



of a world contribute to its status. Some of the
characteristics described in this section are directly tied
to T5 system description values: Importance, Resource
units and the underlying T5 economic extension factors
of resources, Labour, Infrastructure and Efficiency,
although the derivation of these values differs from T5
methods. Other characteristics such as gross world
product, per capita income and inequality rating are
basic economic evaluation values to guide a Referee in
both describing a world and determining its capabilities.

TRADE CODES


A world’s trade codes are shorthand for the combination
of characteristics that describe a world’s basic nature
and are often the basis of factors related to the world’s
economic capabilities and general importance. The
Trade Codes table is essentially a copy of that found in
the Traveller Core Rulebook on page 260, with further
description on page 156 but it is included below for
reference. A world must match all of the conditions across
the classification row to qualify for a specific trade code.

IMPORTANCE


Trade codes, starport class and base presence from
the Starport Facilities table on page 194 are necessary
for some importance factors. Some worlds have

characteristics which make them more important than
others. Importance is a relative value that can act as a
DM or an indicator for economic or political activities.
In general, it can range from +5 to -3. To determine
importance, add the following values:

Importance Modifiers
Condition Value
Starport A or B +1
Starport D, E or X -1
Population 0–6 -1
Population 9+ +1
Tech Level 0–8 -1
Tech Level A–F +1
Tech Level G+ +2
Agricultural +1
Industrial +1
Rich +1
Two or more bases present* +1
X-Boat waystation present +1
*The presence of a corsair base does not count as a
basis for importance calculations.

**RESOURCE FACTOR**
The raw resource rating is determined on page

131. For worlds with native life, this also requires
determination of life-related rating characteristics
for life. If this determination is not conducted, use
an unmodified 2D roll for the initial resource rating.
The natural endowment of a world with resources,
including minerals, energy sources and biological
materials has a direct effect on its potential wealth.
However, these resources need to be both extracted
and conserved to provide short and long term value to
a world’s economy.

The resource rating value determined on page 131
indicates a world’s inherent resource capacity. Worlds
that are industrial or agricultural should subtract 1D-1
from their resource rating (to a minimum rating of 2)
to account for resource depletion over time. Once a
world reaches TL8, space-based resources become
available, either through outpost or robotic mining
operations. Such worlds add 1 to their resource factor
value for each non-mainworld planetoid belt or gas
giant in the star system.

**_Resource Factor =_** Resource Rating + DMs

TL8+ DM+Each of the system’s planetoid
belts and gas giants
Industrial DM+1-1D
Agricultural Agricultural

If resource depletion reduces the resource factor below
2, treat the value as 2 plus the number of planetoid
belts and gas giants.

**LABOUR FACTOR**
Resources do not add much value sitting in the
ground. Even resources left untouched as ecotourist
destinations generate no income without tour guides.
A world’s labour force provides the ability to use the
resources available. Not every person contributes to
directly adding value. A world’s population includes
dependents, retired workers, the idle rich and people
in necessary support roles that enable others to
create wealth. As a baseline value, 10% of the world’s
population directly contributes to the world’s wealth.

**_Labour Factor =_** Population code - 1

This rough number does not correspond to the
realities of many disparate situations but varying

factors are considered in the efficiency factor of a
world’s economy. A world with a Population code of 1
or 0 has a labour factor of 0.

Infrastructure Factor
To allow a pool of labour to access the world’s
resources and create wealth, it needs sufficient
infrastructure. This includes a transportation network,
energy production, housing, industry, utilities, hospitals
and all the trappings of civilisation. The core level
of infrastructure is related to a world’s importance,
representing the outside investment or initial
colonisation effort expended in supporting a world’s
growth. As the population increases, its infrastructure
needs and capabilities increase as well, generated by
both internal and external investment and development.

**_Infrastructure Factor =_** Importance + DMs

Population 4–6 DM+1D
Population 7+ DM+2D

If a world has no population or if the world’s infrastructure
factor is less than 0, it has no infrastructure.

EFFICIENCY FACTOR


Regardless of a world’s wealth, people and
infrastructure, their effectiveness depends on a
number of factors including how well the infrastructure
is maintained, how much wealth is wasted through
corruption and poor governance, and factors beyond
anyone’s control, such as topography and weather.

Variance in efficiency factors depends on population
values and various other modifiers:

Efficiency Factor (Population 0) = -5
Efficiency Factor (Population 1–6) = 2D-7 + DMs
Efficiency Factor (Population 7+) = 2D3-4 + DMs

Government 0, 3, 6, 9, B, C or F DM-1
Government 1, 2, 4, 5 or 8 DM+1
Law Level 0–4 DM+1
Law Level A+ DM-1
PCR 0–3 DM-1
PCR 8+ DM+1
Progressiveness 1–3 DM-1
Progressiveness 9+ DM+1
Expansionism 1–3 DM-1
Expansionism 9+ DM+1

world social characteristics



A world’s efficiency factor is limited to a range of +5 to
-5 but a factor of 0 is always treated as +1 instead. The
world’s efficiency factor can be used as a DM when
determining the degree of efficiency in the government
or private industry providing services, or in the
likelihood of bribery or influence being a more effective
method of achieving results than official channels.

RESOURCE UNITS


Resource units (RU) are a measure of a system’s
net contribution to an interstellar polity. Resource
unit values, especially when negative, are not useful
measures of economic strength for single systems
or smaller polities, but for a region larger than a
subsector or some 30 or more systems, it is a useful
shorthand for determining the economic impact
and value of a particular system within the overall
economy of the polity or region.

RU = Resource Factor × Labour Factor × Infrastructure
Factor × Efficiency Factor

If any of these factors is has a value of 0, for the
purposes of the RU calculation their value is treated as

1. Only the efficiency factor can be negative. A negative
RU is an indication of systems requiring investment or
a transfer of payments from a larger polity to maintain
the world as a functioning member of an interstellar
state. Depending on the nature of the polity, more
direct intervention to improve a world’s efficiency factor
may be a viable alternative to continually transferring
resources to a moribund system.

GROSS WORLD PRODUCT


The most direct measure of a world’s wealth is its
gross world product (GWP), the total value of the
output of the world’s economy over the course of
a standard year. The GWP is computed from the
average economic contribution of each member of
the world’s population, or the per capita GWP. A base
value for the world is modified by a number of factors
to arrive at this global value. For balkanised worlds,
this value can be computed for each nation, faction, or
for the world as a whole.

Base Value: The base value of a world’s GWP is a per
capita (per person) value related to its infrastructure
factor plus the value of its resource factor but only up to
the infrastructure factor value. For the purposes of this

calculation, if the world has a population greater than
0 each factor is assumed to have a value of at least 1.
For instance, if a world had an infrastructure factor of 6
and a resource factor of 7, the base value would be 6
+ 6 = 12. If a world had an infrastructure factor of 0 and
a resource factor of 2, the base value would still be 1
+ 1 = 2, as the resource factor would be limited by the
‘adjusted’ infrastructure factor of 1.

**_Base Value =_** Infrastructure Factor + Resource Factor

Upper Bound: 2 × Infrastructure Factor
Lower Bound: 2

GWP Modifiers: The base value of the per capita GWP
is modified by a number of factors including the world’s (or nation or faction) ports, Tech Level, Government
code, and trade classifications.

Tech Level Modifier: A world’s Tech Level modifier is
simply the world’s UWP Tech Level divided by 10. For
TL0 worlds, the modifier is 0.05.

**_Tech Level Modifier =_** TL ÷ 10

Lower Bound: 0.05

Port Modifier: The world’s starport or spaceport
has a modifier based on the type listed in the Port
Modifier table:

Port Modifier
Port Modifier
A 1.5
B 1.2
C 1.0
D 0.8
E 0.5
F 0.9
G 0.7
H 0.4
Y 0.2
X 0.2

Government Modifier: Each Government code has a
modifier listed in the Government Modifier table.

1 1.5
2 1.2

*For the world as a whole. The Referee may consider
computing each faction or nation’s contribution to the
GWP separately.

**Trade Code Modifier:** Certain trade codes can act as
GWP modifiers, as indicated in the following table:

**Trade Code Modifier**

Trade Code Modifier
Agricultural 0.9
Asteroid 1.2
Garden 1.2
Industrial 1.1
Non-Agricultural 0.9
Non-Industrial 0.9
Poor 0.8
Rich 1.2
default modifier 1.0

Every trade code relevant to the world is applied as A
separate modifier. If no trade code modifiers apply, the
default trade code modifier value is 1.0

**Total Modifiers:** All GWP modifiers are multiplied
together to determine the total modifiers:

**_Total Modifiers =_** TL Modifier x Port Modifier x

Government Modifier x Trade Code Modifiers

Efficiency Factor: Efficiency has the greatest impact
on GWP. It matters whether the world’s efficiency is
positive or negative (it cannot be zero):

Case 1: Positive Efficiency Factor. Efficiency is a
multiplier to GWP:

GWP per capita = Cr1000 × Base Value × Total
Modifiers × Efficiency Factor

Case 2: Negative Efficiency Factor. Efficiency acts as
a divisor to GWP. The efficiency factor minus 1 is used
as a negative divisor. For instance, if a world’s efficiency
factor was -1, the divisor would be -(-1 - 1) = 2.

**_GWP per Capita =_**

Cr1000 X

Total GWP: The world’s total GWP is simply the
GWP per capita multiplied by the world’s total world
population, which should at least be known to one digit
as P × 10Population Code. If total world population has been
determined to a greater degree of accuracy, then that
value should be used.

**_Total GWP =_** GWP per capita x Total World Population

On balkanised worlds, the actual population of the
faction or nation may be the ‘total population’ value used
for determining that region’s contribution to the GWP.

Optional Balkanised World Procedure: Factions or
nations (subunits) of balkanised worlds can potentially
have different modifiers for government and Tech
Level. If the Referee so chooses, the GWP per capita
calculation for these subunits could be computed
separately and added up for a world-wide total GWP
value. Trade code and starport modifiers should
apply world-wide for all subunits and the four factors
determining RUs (resource, labour, infrastructure and
efficiency) should retain global values. On some worlds
and in some campaigns, the Referee could choose to
compute all economic factors, including the four that
determine RU at a subunit level, but unless it serves
a specific need, it is not practical – it would be time-consuming and may not easily create a result similar
to that of the world as a whole (e.g., if no nation had a
population over one billion, the world could never be
high population or industrial, despite at a world-wide
level the population exceeded one billion).

WORLD TRADE NUMBER


Another statistical rating used to determine a world’s
economic and propensity for trade is the world trade
number (WTN), based on a world’s Tech Level,
population and starport class. First, calculate the
world’s base WTN:

**_Base WTN =_** Population code + DMs

TL0–1 DM-1
TL5–8 DM+1
TL9–14 DM+2
TL15+ DM+3

Then, determine the WTN starport modifier:

WTN Starport Modifier
Base WTN Class A Class B Class C Class D Class E Class X
0–1 +3 +2 +2 +1 +1 0
2–3 +2 +2 +1 +1 0 0
4–5 +2 +1 +1 0 0 -5
6–7 +1 +1 0 0 -1 -6
8–9 +1 0 0 -1 -2 -7
A-B (10–11) 0 0 -1 -2 -3 -8
C-D (12–13) 0 -1 -2 -3 -4 -9
E+ (14+) 0 -2 -3 -4 -5 -10

These values add to determine the world trade number:

**_WTN =_** Base WTN + WTN Starport Modifier

If the result is less than 0, it is recorded as 0. The
WTN is an eHex index number recorded by the
IISS and useful for determining trade routes and
volumes of trade between systems. (Note: This
WTN is exactly twice the WTN determined using the
GURPs Traveller Far Trader supplement). A WTN
value influences the level of traffic to starports and
can be used as a modifier for obtaining cargos and
passengers based on its value as a characteristic,
similar to the cultural traits DMs on the Potential
Cultural Traits DMs table on page 181.

INEQUALITY RATING


A world’s per capita GWP does not mean that each of
its people has a standard of living comparable to that
amount. All societies have some level of inequality,
some more or less than others. A common measure of
inequality is to envision a world where everyone has
an equal share of wealth; this results in an inequality
rating of 0. If instead, all of the world’s wealth is in the
hands of one person, the inequality rating is 100. No
society is likely to approach either absolute limit with
most falling in the range of 25–75, but different factors
can influence the rating. To determine a world’s
inequality rating begin with a value of 50. The rating
is decreased (more equality) by positive efficiency
ratings and increased (less equality) by negative
values and then modified by a variety of factors:

Inequality Rating = 50 – Efficiency Rating × 5 + (2D-7)
× 2 + DMs

Optional Balkanised World Procedure: Factions with
differing governments may have differing inequality
ratings based on both structural and chance factors.
To arrive at a global total inequality rating based on
factional or national ratings, each of these values
should be combined in proportion to the population of
each faction or nation to arrive at a world-wide score.
Variations to per capita GWP and inequality rating also
allow for a separate development score (see below)
for each world subunit. The development score for the
world should be determined either from world-wide
values, or a population-weighted average from each
component faction or nation.

**DEVELOPMENT SCORE**
The IISS Survey Office began computing a relative
development score for use with the second survey. This
score correlates somewhat to the perceived wellbeing
of people in a technological civilisation but has been
criticised as useless or misleading in societies which
intentionally eschew higher technology or materialism.
The formula for the development score is:

**_Development Score =_**

**TARIFFS**
Most worlds make some effort to protect local industry
or raise revenue by imposing tariffs on incoming
goods. These costs are normally borne by the seller
or importer. Tariffs may apply broadly to all imported
goods, to goods from certain worlds, and/or to certain
categories of trade goods. These apply directly to the
gross sale price of speculative goods on a destination
world. The Referee can record permanent tariffs to the
detail desired, roll for tariffs each time goods are sold,
or ignore tariffs entirely, declaring the region a free
trade zone. A trader with any Admin or Broker skill is
likely to know the tariff rate at a destination world prior
to departure, although the Referee may impose a skill
check or decide to alter the tariffs literally in flight.

A result of 4, meaning a tariff only on foreign polity
goods, applies to goods crossing interstellar borders,
e.g., between the Darrian Confederation and the
Sword Worlds. They could apply to independent worlds
outside the polity as well.

The Third Imperium was founded on the principles of
free trade and frowns on any tariffs imposed between
member worlds, although in response to unfair market
conditions or to develop a strategic industry, a world
may appeal to Imperial authorities through their noble
representative for permission from the minister of
commerce to impose a temporary tariff on certain
goods. In these cases, the tariff is most often 1D% of
the sale value. Trade goods originating from outside the
Imperium are not subject to free trade restrictions and
tariffs have a standard chance of applying.

TAXES


Taxes may be inevitable but taking them into account
in Traveller is something Referees should consider
ignoring for game purposes. The Referee can assume
that most worlds raise revenue by a value added tax (VAT) built into the cost of goods. Where starports are
extraterritorial, this may result in ‘duty-free’ stores within
the starport itself which sell certain items at a discount (or the starport authority may be collecting a VAT for their
own operating budgets), or the Referee can assume list
prices are the duty-free prices and add a percentage
cost to all items purchased on a particular world outside
the starport’s boundaries. VATs could range from 1–50%
and could be different for different classes of items or
buyers; the Referee insisting on this level of detail could
use the Tariff Rates table for inspiration.

ECONOMIC PROFILE


The economic aspects of a world are complex and
varying. To maintain consistency with other formats, an
economic profile record is as follows:

Tc, Im, RL+E, RU, pcGWP, WTN, IR, DR

Where Tc = Trade codes alphabetically and separated
by spaces, Im = importance, R = resource factor, L =
labour factor, I = infrastructure factor, +E = + efficiency
factor, RU = resource units, pcGWP = per capita
GWP, WTN = WTN, IR = inequality rating, and DR =
development rating.

Zed Prime is a balkanised world. For illustrative
purposes, this example will consider the economics
of the world as a whole where necessary but will treat
each faction separately for per capita GWP, inequality
rating and development score. Zed Prime’s trade codes
are agricultural and rich. Each of these adds one to
the world’s importance but its Tech Level of 8 causes
a decrease of one, so its final importance is +1. Its
resource factor is initially its resource ratingB (11). For
agricultural resource depletion it receives +1 minus 1D
rolling a 3 for a net loss of 2, but as the world is TL8, it
also gets +4 and +2 for gas giants and planetoid belts,
respectively, for a final resource factor = 15 or F. Its
labour factor is simply population -1 or 7 - 1 = 6 for the
entire world. The infrastructure factor is equal to its
importance (+1) plus 2D (a 12!) for a population of 7+,
which equals 13 or D.

Zed Prime’s efficiency factor should not normally
receive a penalty for Government 7, despite both
faction Government codes 3 and B receiving a DM-1 –
the Referee decides to stick with no penalty to simulate

competition between the various factions and nations.
The PCR of 3 does cause DM-1, the progressiveness
and expansionism ratings for both factions is identical
and neither warrants another DM, so with a Population
of 7, the roll for efficiency factor is 2D3 -4 -1, resulting
in a -2 efficiency factor. Not good.

RU is always a world-wide computation. The RU
value for Zed Prime is negative because of its
efficiency rating, so its expensive infrastructure and
vast resources are actually a big drain on any larger
interstellar state’s budget with RU = 15 × 6 × 13 × -2
= -2,340. The Referee has decided that the world is in
an independent system in a border region, so this RU
does not matter much – the world is on its own to keep
things running (and may be failing in that regard).

The Referee decides to compute the economic
might of Zed Prime by faction, first determining that
the share of population is 54% or 9.72 million for
governorships (I) and 46% or 8.28 million for oligarchs (II). First, both factions receive a base value from the
infrastructure factorD (13) + resource factorF (15),
bounded by the infrastructure factor to 2 × 13 = 26.
To this value, various modifiers apply: Tech Level is
8 ÷ 10 = 0.8, the port modifier for a Class C port is
just 1.0. Trade codes are agricultural 0.9 and rich 1.2.
Tech Level and Government codes differ between
factions: I: TL7, Government:B, II: TL8 Government:3.
Their respective modifiers are I: 0.7, 0.9, and II: 0.8,
0.8. For each, using the separate modifiers, are
governorships (I) 0.7 × 1 × 0.9 × 0.9 × 1.2 = 0.6804,
oligarchs 0.8 × 1 × 0.8 × 0.9 × 1.2 = 0.6912.

Since Zed Prime has a negative efficiency factor, its
GWP per capita for governorships is 1,000 × 26 ×
0.6804 ÷ (-(-2-1)) = Cr5896.8 and for oligarchs 1000
× 26 × 0.6804 ÷ (-(-2-1)) = Cr5990.4. As a weighted
average, this is Cr5940 per capita for the world and to
the nearest billion, MCr107000 total world GWP.

WTN is always computed for the entire world. It is 7 for
population, +1 for Tech Level and +0 from the table for
a final value of 8.

Zed Prime’s inequality rating is also determined by faction.
_The common factors are +10 for Efficiency ( minus a_
negative value of 2 times 5) +3 for PCR and -13 for
infrastructure, leaving a net DM+0. For the governorships,
DMs are +10 for government code and +2 for Law Level,
or net DM+12. Rolling 8 for (2D-7) × 2 adds another
_+2, for a final inequality rating of 50 + 14 = 64. For the_
oligarchs, DMs net +5 and the 2D roll is a 5, resulting in
-4, for a net DM+1 or inequality rating of 51. The world
population-weighted average score rounds to 58.
world social characteristics

The development score for governorships is 5,896.8 ÷
_1,000 × (1 - 64 ÷ 100) = 2.12 to two significant digits,_
for the oligarchs it is 5,990.4 ÷ 1,000 × (1 - 51 ÷ 100) =
2.94, and using world-wide numbers, the world’s score
is 5,940 ÷ 1,000 × (1 - 58 ÷ 100) = 2.49.

_Being an independent system, tariffs are determined_
on a 2D roll, with the Referee deciding to use global
government and Law Level values, which provide no
_DMs, and the roll is a 9, resulting in varying tariffs of_
1D × 1D%, which the Referee doesn’t want to become
overly prescriptive about and decides it should be a
global value based on two 1D rolls multiplied together,
or 4 × 3 = 12% across the board for all imported goods.

_The economic profile for Zed Prime is Ag Ri, +1, F6D-2,_
-2,340, 5,940, 8, 58, 2.49.

**SECONDARY WORLDS**
The economy of secondary worlds follows the same
procedures as mainworlds, except for three factors:

1. A secondary world can never have a higher
    importance than the mainworld – if this occurs,
    lower the importance of the secondary world to
    that of the mainworld. Or possibly reconsider the
    choice of mainworld.
2. A dependent secondary world should not add the
    resources of the system’s planetoid belts and
    gas giants to its own. An independent secondary
    world may add some or all of the resource
    values from planetoid belts and gas giants at the
    Referee’s discretion.
3. A secondary world receives an additional decrease
    of one to its importance for the purposes of
    determining ship traffic. This does not apply to a
    designated freeport.

Zed Secundus has desert, non-industrial and poor as
_its trade codes. Its importance does not suffer from_
the low Tech Level but losses a point of importance
_because of its low population and gains no benefit from
any other modifiers giving it importance = -1 (which is_
two less than Zed Prime, so it needs no adjustment).
Its base resource rating is 6, and the Referee decides
to give it +1 for its gas giant primary planet (yes, this
double-counts the gas giant by giving its bonus to both
Prime and Secundus, but the Referee is not bothered
by this) but nothing for the rest of the system, so its
_final resource rating is 7. The labour rating is simply_

_4. Infrastructure is -1 + 1D = 3. Efficiency factor can_
vary greatly at lower population levels, so the 2D-7
roll with DM+5 (for government, Law Level, PCR,
progressiveness, and expansionism) is 9-7 + 5 = 7, but
_the efficiency rating maxes out at +5._

Computing base value, infrastructure is the limiting
factor, so it is 2 × 3 = 6. TL modifier is 0.9, Port is 1.0,
government is 1.3 and trade codes are 0.9 and 0.8 for
a total modifier of 0.8424. With a positive efficiency
factor, Zed Secundus has a GWP per capita of 1,000
× 6 × 0.8424 × 5 = Cr25272. So, despite being a
poor desert moon with limited infrastructure, its good
governance and progressive, expansionist outlook
gives it a per capita wealth of more than three times
its rich, agricultural, but rather overindulgent and
backwards neighbour.

Zed Secundus has an inequality rating of 50 - 5 × 5
+ 2D-7 × 2 + 8 - 3 = 28. That helps its development
score equal 18.20. The freeport’s RU is 7 × 4 × 3 × 5
= 420, respectable but not enough to offset the drain
of the ‘rich’ moon of the neighbouring world. The WTN
for Zed Secundus is 5 + 2 = 7 + 0 = 7. As a freeport,
the DM-7 to the tariff roll results in a negative value,
indicating no tariffs.

STARPORTS


A world’s starport is its gateway to the larger universe.
It may be anything from a vast city in space capable of
producing massive warships and mega-freighters to an
open field with an intermittently powered beacon. It may
be nothing more than some painted lines in the dirt. On
a high technology, high population world, there could be
many places where a starship can land, be repaired or
even built. By convention in Charted Space, only one
facility on the mainworld’s surface and one facility (if any)
in orbit is considered the starport of the system.

Within the Third Imperium, a designated starport facility
is considered extraterritorial and under the jurisdiction
of the Imperial Starport Authority (SPA), originally part
of the IISS, but since 422 a part of the Imperial Ministry
of Commerce. Regardless of whose authority the
facility is under or whether any facility actually exists,
a starport classification is recorded for every charted
mainworld. To determine the class of starport serving a
system, roll 2D with the listed modifiers:

Starport Class
2D+DM Starport Class

2- X

3–4 E
5–6 D

7–8 C

9–10 B
11+ A

world social characteristics



Population 0–2 DM-2

Population 3–4 DM-1
Population 8–9 DM+1

Population A+ DM+2

Additionally, if the Population code is 0,
a starport is usually no better than Class
E, or in unsettled regions it is usually
considered Class X. Frontier or backwater
regions may have a DM-1 to starport
class. Well-travelled main routes or core
regions may have a DM+1 to starport
class but a roll of 2 might still result in a
Class X starport, as it is the indication of a
prohibited or interdicted system.

A starport classification implies the existence
or the possible existence of certain types of
facilities and services.

Base?

Scout

A 6+ Refined Overhaul Starship 8+ 10+ 8+ —

D 12+ Unrefined Minor — — 8+ — 12+
E — — — — — — — 10+
X — — — — — — — 10+
*An Imperial Scout base on a major trade route associated with an express boat route has a 1D = 6 chance of being a
waystation instead.

To determine whether a highport is present use
these DMs:
Population 9+ DM+1

TL9–11 DM+1
TL12+ DM+2

To determine whether a corsair base is present:
Law Level 0 DM+2
Law Level 2+ DM-2

The nearby civilisations and naval presence may alter
the odds of a corsair base. Well-patrolled regions receive
an additional negative DM of 1 or 2, while frontier or
wilderness regions may receive a DM+1. Rarely will a
scout and corsair base occupy the same port, although
they may both be present within a system.

In addition to the facilities and services available at
different starport classifications, the SPA has certain
minimum qualifications relating to the specific capabilities
and regulated costs for berthing for each class.

Sizing for docking space, commercial and residential
zones are applicable for highports but downport-only
facilities must have equivalently sized areas dedicated
to each function or zone. Shipyard tonnage refers to the
total size of downport and highport (if any) shipyards.
Actual build capacity is at best half of this level, as
some of the shipyard bays are often repurposed for
repair and overhaul duties. As a rule of thumb, the
largest vessel a starport shipyard can construct is 10%
of its listed shipyard tonnage.

In Charted Space, a Class X starport in an inhabited
system usually implies the world is under some sort of
interdiction. This may be imposed by an external force,
such the Imperial Navy or Scout Service, or it may be a
choice of the inhabitants, prohibiting interstellar visitors.
These worlds are usually marked as Red Zones.

Beyond Imperial borders, unsettled systems may
have either a starport class of E or X assigned. Class
E implies the world has been charted and some area
cleared or designated as a landing zone capable of
supporting the footprint of a starship of at least 400
tons. If the world has a vibrant biosphere and lacks
visitors for more than a few years or decades, this
designated landing spot may become unsuitable and
the E classification more a notation in a database than
a fact on the ground.

These rules apply in regions where interstellar contact
is common. Even worlds without the Tech Level to
support the construction of starships might have a
Class A port and the imported tools and technicians to
build and maintain such ships. In unexplored space,
a world of TL7 is unlikely to have a Class A port
regardless of the roll, although the Referee could have
fun with a prototech ‘clockwork starship’ if desired.

SPACEPORTS


Every facility in a system capable of handling
spacecraft that is not the starport is a spaceport. This is
the official policy of the Third Imperium but it does not
hold outside its borders and is often more a policy than
a reality even within Imperial borders.

Spaceports exist on secondary worlds with a permanent
population or at least regular visitors. They may also
exist in or near major cities or industrial centres on
a mainworld. Spaceports in orbit or free space are
considered space stations that may have characteristics
which qualify them as spaceports. In general, a port
designated as a spaceport is considered a recognised
facility with public access. This differentiates them from
private ports and freeports. To determine if a secondary
world or inhabited space station has a spaceport, roll 1D
with the listed modifiers:

Spaceport Class and Facilities

1D+DM Class Fuel Repair Remarks Equivalent Starport Class
2- Y — — No spaceport X
3 H — — Primitive installation E
4–5 G Unrefined — Basic facility D
6 F Unrefined Minor Good facility C
7 F Refined Overhaul Possible spacecraft shipyard B
8 F Refined Overhaul Possible starship shipyard A

Population 6+ DM+2
Population 1 DM-1
Population 0 DM-3

world social characteristics



Spaceport classifications indicate the minimum
requirements for the facility. Nations on balkanised
worlds and cities on any world may have public
spaceports. Referees can use the previous table and
DMs to randomly check for a spaceport in a particular
mainworld location, if desired.

On the mainworld, many facilities listed as Class F
may even approach Class A or B standards, despite
the F designator requiring little better than Class D
equivalency. If the Referee so elects or if a world is not
subject to the SPA, any spaceport can be considered
a starport, with its class as indicated in the equivalent
starport class column of the table page 195, although
these secondary ports are usually of no better Class
than the first or official starport.

A Class G facility is not much better than a pad,
minimal and possibly automated traffic control and a
fuel pump. On some privately owned worlds, those
with corporate governments especially, this may be
the ‘public’ port but a private corporate port might be
substantially better.

A Class H spaceport is the spaceport equivalent of
a class E starport, a cleared landing area deemed
safe enough for landing a starship without crashing or
causing the ground to collapse.

Class Y is the equivalent of a class X starport without
the stigma or restriction. No safe landing zone is
identified and anyone setting down on this world is
on their own.

PRIVATE PORTS


A private port is a spaceport that is not open to general
traffic. It may be a corporate-owned facility at a mining
outpost, transportation hub or shipyard facility or it
may be limited to government-operated spacecraft for
military, customs control or research purposes. Some
wealthy individuals and nobles may own a private port,
accessible to outsiders only by invitation.

The Referee may assign a private port as desired
or use the Spaceport Class and Facilities table
to determine its class. A private port could be the
equivalent of a starport of better quality than the
official starport but as it is not a public facility, it does
not supersede the world or system’s general starport
or spaceport rating. Although this superior port may
influence effective Tech Levels within its controlling
enclave, it does not provide any bonuses to a world’s
Tech Level roll.

FREEPORTS


A freeport is a public or quasi-public port not officially
recognised by the SPA or by the local system
government. Usually situated outside the effective
jurisdiction of the local world’s control, often in orbit
around a remote gas giant or above or upon some
other distant world, the freeport can be either a
spaceport or a starport, corporately run or independent.

The Referee can choose to roll on the Starport Class
or the Spaceport Class and Facilities table with DMs
for the world’s population to determines the class of
starport or spaceport for the freeport. For independent
secondary worlds, the any Tech Level DM associated
with the classification does potentially provide a bonus
to the freeport’s Tech Level roll.

Any spaceport randomly generated on a secondary
world that is independent of the mainworld, meaning it
is not Government code 6 or subject to the mainworld’s
Law Level or worse, may be designated a freeport.
Any spaceport generated on a secondary world with
a Government code 1 can be a corporate freeport.
These categorisations are at the Referee’s decision,
independent of the random roll for freeport on the
Secondary World Categorisation table on page 163.

Corporate freeports tend to be tightly run ports.
They can range from austere to luxurious but their
main purpose is to earn a profit. Prices will be high
and security will at least be good enough to prevent
disruption to economic activities.

In general, a freeport will have no affiliation with the
local government at all, as in the GeDeCo port at
Oghma or the independent freeport at Blue, both in
the Trojan Reach.

If a Referee so desires, a freeport does not need to
be linked with any world. If treated as a starport and a
roll to check for a highport indicates that the freeport
is a highport, then no surface installation needs to
exist. The Referee could decide to place a downport
on a body but the freeport does not need to be near
a natural body in the solar system. It may be just a
space station in its own orbit around the sun(s). For
world recording purposes, the port itself would be
considered a Size 0 object.

**PORT CAPACITY**
The economics section provides the values for
importance, WTN and efficiency required below.
The amount of ship traffic a port receives has direct
influence on the size of a starport. While some
world social characteristics

starports might be overbuilt as part of a prestige project
and others might be bursting at the seams with ships
waiting for days or weeks for an open berth, most
starports will tend to gravitate towards a supportable
size. Ships tend to stay in port for about a week, maybe
two if conducting maintenance, but longer stays mean
higher costs and port operators do not want idle ships
preventing their more active counterparts from moving
people and goods through the port facilities.

A starport should be built at least large enough to
handle its average weekly traffic and perhaps some
multiple of daily maximum traffic. The latter is especially
true for lower volume ports – having only one landing
pad is inconvenient and possibly embarrassing when a
second ship arrives. A world’s importance is a factor not
only in the number of ships that arrive but in their size.
A more important and higher population world is much
more likely to see a 10,000+ ton megafreighter arrive
than an outpost of a few hundred people which could
be supplied by a single free trader.

**STARPORT TRAFFIC**
A world’s importance, combined with its location and
trading status, is the major factor in the quantity and
frequency of starship traffic. To determine the quantity
and/or frequency of starship arrivals at a world’s
starport consult the Expected Ship Traffic table.

In systems that are major trade hubs (WTN = A+),
the effective importance of a world for ship traffic
purposes is increased by one. This increase is for
traffic, not capacity, as it does not necessarily bring in

**Expected Ship Traffic**

Importance Definition Daily Traffic Daily Maximum Expected Weekly

+ Exceptional Trade Hub 3D × 20 + 2D-7 365 2,000
5 Very Important 3D × 10 + 2D-7 185 1,000

4 Important 2D+10 22 150

3 Ordinary 2D-5 7 30
2 Ordinary 1D-2 4 20

1 Ordinary 1D-3 3 10
0 Unimportant 1D-4 2 5

-1 Unimportant 1D-5 1 3

-2 Very Unimportant 2D-11 1 2
-3 Very Unimportant 2D-11 1 1

— Uncharted 3D-17 1 0

— Unexplored 4D-23 1 0

the massive freighters required by a world of greater
inherent importance. For worlds on or beyond a frontier (but not at a border with another interstellar state with
which there is trade), or for worlds with a WTN of 4 or
less, the effective importance of a world for ship traffic
purposes is decreased by one. The expected weekly
column is based on a rounded number from daily traffic
and a reasonable variance to cover surges.

A result of 0 or less on the daily traffic roll equals no
traffic arriving that day. If the safe jump diameter is far
from the starport, as for worlds far inside their star(s)
100D limit, the Referee may wish to determine traffic
based on ships exiting jump space rather than when
they arrive at port. Ship encounters can be resolved
using the Space Encounter table on page 155 of the
Traveller Core Rulebook, or some other encounter
table relevant to a region such as the Prey Encounter
table from page 14 of The Pirates of Drinax Book 1.
Values for uncharted and unexplored are included as
reference for explorers of barren worlds beyond the
bounds of civilised space.

Starports also have minimum size requirements for
various features as detailed in the Minimum Starport
Capabilities and Costs table on page 195. This
represents a floor for starport certification but many
ports far exceed these values or may have multiple
port installations to cover all system traffic. A world with
an efficient economy has a port generally in line with
traffic requirements, while those with lower efficiencies
may have ports less aligned to market conditions.
To determine the size and capacity of a port, use the
following formulas for each type of port.

These equations assume the following:
•	 If the effective importance was adjusted by a high
WTN for the purpose of increasing expected traffic,
the actual importance is used in these calculations,
but if a world’s importance is less than +1, treat it
as +1 in these calculations.
•	 Expected weekly is determined from the Expected
Ship Traffic table on page 197.
•	 Population refers to the population code of the world.
•	 Round results up to the nearest 100.

Highport internal docking capacity (which requires three
times the displacement of the ships it can accommodate)
varies greatly, sometimes using spare shipyard capacity
to accommodate ships. For most highports, internal
docking capacity will be no more than 10% of total
docking capacity; a Class D highport rarely has any
internal capacity and may be little more than a converted
hull with airlocks marked as docking ports.

Repairs, annual maintenance and any other overhaul
work requires an internal bay. A highport will generally
have one internal bay equal to 10% of its total internal
bay capacity (or 1% of its total docking capacity)
but most will be sized to accommodate the most
common sizes of ships serviced by the starport. A
world of importance 0 or less rarely has any bays
accommodating ships larger than 600–800 tons and
most bays will be sized for ships of 400 tons or less.

DOWNPORT TOTAL DOCKING CAPACITY


A downport’s capacity depends on the existence of a
highport. On many worlds, a downport supporting a
major highport is little more than a transit terminal for
passenger and cargo shuttles. On worlds without a
highport, the downport must have enough pad capacity
to qualify for a starport classification and uses the same
calculation as for highport capacity. A Class E downport
has the following size calculation:

**_E=_** 400 + Importance × Expected Weekly ×100 ×

Populationx ( 1 + )

This is barely different than a Class D but a Class
E has no internal bays and no facilities beyond
a (possibly) functional beacon and maybe some
lighting and a control tower.

Also important for downports is their pad sizes. Few
ships larger than 5,000 tons are capable of planetary
landing, so only the rare port that expects larger ships
has any downport pads exceeding 5,000 tons capacity.
The maximum pad size at most downports is 2,000 or
1,000 tons. Most pads intended for starship landings
are sized to support ships up to 400 tons but large
ports will also have pads dedicated to 200 and 100 ton
ships for more efficient space usage. A 1,000 ton pad is
normally the largest available at Class C ports.

As with highports, most downports will only have
enclosed and pressurised pads available to support
10% of capacity but on inclement worlds, especially
those with corrosive or insidious atmospheres, all or at
least most pads will be environmentally sealed. This
is rarely true for worlds which are only dangerous to
people but not to ships; on worlds with vacuum or trace
atmospheres a terminal with docking arm extensions
serves most vessels in a manner similar to highports’
external docking terminals.

If a highport exists, the Referee may decide to limit
the size of the downport to 1D × 10% of the highport
capacity or split the capacity that was determined for
the highport into downport and highport portions.

**SHIPYARD BUILD CAPACITY**
Class A starports and associated facilities have the
capacity to build starships. Class B starports have
shipyards that can build interplanetary spacecraft.
Class C starports can build small craft of 100 tons or
less but few ports of this class focus on shipbuilding,
except perhaps to support a local mining community.

For certification, a Class A starport must have a
shipyard of 25,000 tons but a shipyard requires two
tons for every ton of ship built. Minimum yard build
capacity for Class A certification is therefore 12,500
tons. For Class B minimum yard build capacity is 5,000
tons. Class C starports are not required to have any
yards at all, although they may support the construction
of small craft. Actual capacity depends upon the total
world population (TWP) and a number of factors:

**_Class A Yard Build Capacity =_** (Efficiency +

Infrastructure + 1D + DMs) x

**_Class B Yard Build Capacity =_** (Efficiency +

Infrastructure + 1D + DMs) x

**_Class C Yard Build Capacity =_** (Efficiency +

Infrastructure + 1D-3 + DMs) x

TL0–8 DM-4
TL12–14 DM+2
TL15+ DM+4
Non-Industrial DM-2
Industrial DM+2

Round the result up to the nearest 100. If the Class
A result is less than 10,000 tons, change the result to
9,000 tons + 1D × 500 tons. This may still represent
a shortfall from Class A requirements but indicates a
portion of the yard is not available for any number of
reasons. Class A shipyards on a world of TL8 or less
are either building prototype vessels or using imported
jump drive components and tooling to complete its
starships. In either case, ships built at these yards will
cost at least twice the standard starship price.

If the Class B result is less than 5,000 tons, change
the result to 4000 + 2D × 100 tons. At the Referee’s
discretion Class B shipyards may be able to complete
starships built with imported jump drives, although such
drives should cost double, and the local Tech Level
must be high enough to support the drive components,
i.e., a TL11 Class B port could only use imported jump
drives of TL11 or less. As with Class A yards, a Class
B yard may be able to build higher TL ships but such
ships will cost twice or more standard prices.

If the Class C result is less than 0, then no functional
Class C shipyard exists. Even where such yards
exist, they may be detached or unaffiliated spacecraft

builders. The Referee can rule that no shipyards exist
for any particular Class C port. On worlds of less than
TL8, such Class C yards rarely exist.

Maximum construction bay size of any shipyard
does not normally exceed 10% of total shipyard
capacity. Larger ships may be built in segments to
be assembled later but this is only possible for orbital
shipyards. If no highport exists, this option is limited
to Size 0 worlds. Where highports exist, the Referee
is free to allocate the total shipyard capacity between
the highport and downport.

The construction of some ships, especially larger
ships, may tie down yard capacity for years or possibly
decades, so a shipyard’s annual output is normally
some fraction of its total capacity. For shipyards
specialising in smaller starships or small craft, annual
output may actually exceed the shipyard’s capacity but
for most yards annual output as a percentage of yard
capacity will actually decrease as yard size increases.
This depends to a large extent on the importance of a
world, since more important worlds require larger ships.
To determine annual output:

**_Annual Shipyard Output (for Importance 1+) =_**

Annual Shipyard Output (for Importance 0-) =
Shipyard Build Capacityx (1 - Importance)

This factor does not apply to Class C shipyards. As
they only produce small craft, their shipyard output is
always equal to 10 times their shipyard build capacity.

Zed Prime has a previously rolled Class C starport.
Delving into details, with a Population of 7 and TL8,
there is no DM for a highport and a 2D roll of 6
indicates none exists. Class C starports have no naval
bases; the roll for scout base is a 12 – one definitely
exists and for military base, 9, none. The Referee
makes no roll for a waystation.

The Class C starport designation corresponds
to one of the nations in the oligarch faction. For
other nations, the Referee decides against rolling
for all seven but does roll for the biggest of the
governorship faction, which has a population of at
least 6. A roll of 4 + 2 = 6 and indicates a Class F
spaceport, which is potentially effectively a Class
C equivalent, or would be if an outside authority
recognised it as the primary starport.

Zed Prime has an importance of +1 and a WTN of 8, so
there is no reason to change the effective importance
of the system with regards to ship traffic. Zed Prime can
expect to see 1D-3 ships per day, or up to 10 per week
as an average. That is also the likely number of ships
at the Class C downport at any one time. The capacity
of the downport (since there is no highport) is 20,000
+ 1 × 10 × 200 × 7 × (1 + (1D + -2) ÷ 5), resulting in
34,000 – enough to qualify for a class C. Note that
world population is always used for starport capacity,
as this port at least theoretically provides access to the
stars for the entire world.

The Referee determines that the largest pad is 1,000
tons (and decides there are two) and only 3,400 tons
of enclosed landing facility (seven bays supporting
400 tons each and one 600 ton bay) are available.
This facility is actually rather overbuilt for the amount
of expected traffic, so likely one of the large pads and
a large portion of the standard 600 and 400 ton pads (there are a dozen of the larger and three dozen of
the smaller, the rest of the space is for small craft) are
leased to the scout base for its use. On most weeks,
the starport would require less than 4,000 tons of pad
space, a fraction of capacity, to operate. Zed Prime’s
infrastructure is definitely overbuilt. Berthing fees are
rolled as 2 × Cr100 or Cr200 for a standard six day
berthing but the Referee decides to make it Cr500
instead, to cover the inefficiency.

Zed Prime does not require any shipyard facility
but for illustrative purposes, the roll for yard build
capacity is (-2 + 13 + 1D-3 - 4) × 18,000,000 ÷
100,000, resulting in 1,500 tons, Zed Prime’s
overbuilt infrastructure provides for a local small
craft building industry despite the low tech level. As

a Class C shipyard, the annual shipyard output is
10 times the same as its yard capacity. The starport
profile for Zed Prime is C-HN:DY:+1.

Moving to Zed Secundus, the Referee has previously
decided to make this world’s port an independent
starport-class freeport, rolled as if it were an
independent world and resulting in a Class C starport.
The Referee decides the freeport is a downport by
default and checks for a highport with DM+1 for TL9-11, rolling a 7 +1 = no, and getting no for scout and
military bases as well.

The freeport of Zed Secundus has an Importance of -1
and a WTN of 7. Since it is a freeport, its importance is
not lowered with regards to ship traffic, so it can expect
to see 1D-5 starships arrive per day, meaning only
on 1 in 6 days does anyone from outside the system
actually avail themselves of the port and three ships
is the most it will statistically see in port in any week.
The Referee assumes interplanetary traffic keeps the
port afloat. Still, it is a Class C downport-only facility, so
its capacity becomes 20,000 + 1 × 3 × 200 × 5 × (1 +
(1D + 5) ÷ 5), resulting in 27,200 tons of capacity. The
Referee decides to make the port rather similar to the
one on Zed Prime but allows for 4,000 tons of enclosed
bays (two of 600 tons, five of 400 tons, and four of 200
tons) and only two 1,000 ton pads. The rest is a mix of
600, 400, and 200 ton pads and small craft facilities.
Berthing is rolled as Cr300, less expensive than the
port at Zed Prime and with a lower Law Level and lack
of tariffs – all things to entice more traffic.

At TL9, Zed Secundus is more likely to have a shipyard
than its less advanced neighbour with a capacity of
5 + 3 + 1D-3 + -2) × 140,000 ÷ 100,000 resulting in
9.8 rounded up to 100 tons. Low population size has
a major effect on the ability to support a shipbuilding
industry but since the ‘minimum’ shipyard for a Class C
is 200 tons, the Referee decides to increase capacity to
that level. Annual output of the Class C shipyard is 10
times greater, or 2,000 tons. The starport profile for Zed
Secundus is C-HN:DY:-1.

MILITARY


The economics section provides the values for
efficiency and the culture section provides many of the
modifiers for branch existence. Detailed Tech Level
subcategories can optionally be used to determine
modifiers. Most worlds spend a portion of their GWP on
a military, or at least on a law enforcement contingent
able to act as an armed defence force. The amount of
budget spent on armed forces and the nature of those

world social characteristics forces can vary greatly among different governments

and societies and it will change over time in response
to prolonged peace or the threat, or actuality, of war.

The Referee can develop a detailed view of a world’s
military capabilities. This is only necessary if a large
scale naval or mercenary adventure or campaign
requires it. Simply determining whether a branch exists
and estimating the effective military expenditures is
enough work for nearly any other situation. Additional
detail on military force strengths and composition is a
topic for another sourcebook.

**BRANCH OVERVIEW**
Each function performed by the armed forces
of a world has specific capabilities and basic
requirements. Depending on Tech Level, a world can
have various branches.

Each branch represents a capability, not necessarily
a completely different organisational or command
structure. What follows are guidelines for a high level
overview of a world’s military capabilities. How they
are implemented is left to the discretion of the Referee.
For modifiers based on Tech Level, the Referee can
choose to apply Tech Level subcategories both for
military equipment and for transportation associated
with different functions (land, sea, air, space) if desired.

If a branch exists, the Referee should record the
Effect of the existence check as part of the world’s
military summary to determine its relative size or
budget. When a branch exists, an Effect of 0 is treated
as a 1 and Effects above +18 are treated as 18 (J).
For all branches, a nation or faction on a world with
Government code 7 receives both its own government
DMs (if any) and any for Government code 7.

Militancy DMs apply to all branches:

Militancy 1–2 DM-4
Militancy 3–5 DM-1
Militancy 6–8 DM+1
Militancy 9–B DM+2
Militancy C+ DM+4

In addition to militancy and the DMs listed for each
branch below, the following DMs exist when the branch
is involved in active or potential warfare:

Heightened Tensions DM+1
Insurgency DM+2
War DM+4
Total War DM+8

Military Branch Descriptions

Military Branch Category TL Description

Enforcement Surface 0+ Armed law enforcement, including paramilitary internal security
Militia Surface 0+ Defensive light armed forces, often semi-professional or reservists

Army Surface 0+ Professional army
Wet Navy Surface 0+ Professional wet navy

Air Force Close Support 4+ Professional air or close orbit forces

System Defence System Support 7+ Defensive spacecraft and space weapon platforms
Navy Space Combat 8+ Professional system or interstellar space combat forces

Marines Space Assault 8+ Professional offworld assault troops

world social characteristics



These conditions can be drawn from the Faction
Relationship table on page 161. Insurgency assumes
ongoing guerrilla warfare, with some regions possibly
under rebel control. War assumes active combat (ground
warfare, missile strikes, space battles, and so forth)
between belligerents. Total war assumes the continued
existence of the government is at risk or weapons of
mass destruction are in use or are at high risk of being
used. These DMs only apply when relevant to the
function of the branch. For instance, a wet navy might
receive a DM+4 while its government is involved with
a conflict with a neighbouring government with which it
shares a water border or if both governments are fighting
in a world’s seas or oceans, but it would not normally
receive that DM if its government was fighting a foe in a
different star system or if two governments faced off over
a desert border region.

Some branches have a DM for risk. By default risk is
defined as potentially hostile systems within 10 parsecs,
but the Referee may choose to redefine risk to adhere to
local conditions

ENFORCEMENT BRANCH


Nearly every world will have some form of law
enforcement branch, even if it is a Law Level 0 world with
a posse raised as necessary. Organisation and equipment
can range anywhere from unarmed first responders on
foot to paramilitary tactical units in armoured vehicles,
depending on the world’s government and/or Law Level.

**_Enforcement Exists by Default_**

Its relative Effect is abstracted as: 3 + DMs:

Government 0 DM-5
Government B DM+2
Law Level 0 DM-4
Law Level 1 DM-2
Law Level 2 DM-1
Law Level 9–B DM+2
Law Level C+ DM+4
PCR 0-4 DM+2
Factional Uprisings DM+2

Any Effect of less than 1 is treated a 1 unless the
Referee purposely wishes to create a world without any
law enforcement.

MILITIA BRANCH


Not all worlds have militias. These units are often part-time, retired personnel subject to recall or lightly armed

defenders of property with tenuous at best connection
to the local government structure. Militias most often
exist on low Law Level and generally rural worlds. The
militia branch is rarely anything but infantry soldiers
with unarmoured or lightly armoured transportation. A
Referee may decide whether a world has militia forces
or determine it randomly:

**_Militia Exists on 4+:_** roll 2D +DMs

Government 1 DM-4
Government 2 DM+2
Government 6 DM-6
Law Level DM-Law Level
PCR 0–2 DM+2
PCR 3–4 DM+1
PCR 6+ DM-1

ARMY BRANCH


A professional army exists on most balkanised worlds,
those with military bases, some where external or
internal conflict is potentially likely and others that have
treaty obligations to maintain permanent armed forces.
An army may not always be called an army, it may be a
‘self-defence force’, ‘protectors of the faith’ or whatever
name is politically acceptable but a professional
organisation of armed individuals whose mandate
is applying lethal or destructive force to solve the
government’s problems qualifies functionally as an army.

At TL10 and above, as grav vehicles become dominant,
the army often absorbs some or all of the functions
of the wet navy and air force. A Referee may decide
whether a world has an army or determine it randomly:

**_Army Exists on 4+:_** roll 2D +DMs

Militia exists DM-2
Government 0 DM-6
Government 7 DM+4
Government A+ DM+4
TL0-7 DM+4
TL8+ DM-2
Military Base DM+6
Risk DM+2
Factional Uprisings DM+2

A world with Government code 6 uses the DMs of its
owning world and DM+8 if it is, or hosts, a military base
or penal colony or is under direct military rule.

world social characteristics

**WET NAVY BRANCH**
A wet navy only exists on worlds with Hydrographics 1
or above. At TL10+ most duties of a wet navy merge
with those of grav-equipped army units. At these
higher Tech Levels, the remaining wet navy assets
are often deep diving submarines, mostly acting as
missile platforms, although these units are sometimes
assigned to the system defence branch instead.

Even when theoretically needed, a wet navy only
exists on worlds where conflicts fought on water
or amphibious operations are likely. This can be
true on low and mid-tech balkanised worlds, or
high hydrographics worlds with internal unrest. The
Referee should consider local conditions when
determining the existence or size of the wet navy, but
if determined randomly:

**_Wet Navy Exists on 4+:_** roll 2D +DMs

Hydrographics 0 DM-20
Hydrographics 1–3 DM-5
Hydrographics 8 DM+2
Hydrographics 9 DM+4
Hydrographics A DM+8
Government 7 DM+4
TL0 DM-8
TL8–9 DM-2
TL10+ DM-TL

**AIR FORCE BRANCH**
In a traditional sense, an air force requires ‘air’. This is
true for everything from balloons to hypersonic aircraft
but with the advent of grav or lifter technology, flight no
longer requires lift, ‘lighter than air’ gases or combustion
engines. At TL10+ the distinction between ground and
air forces is often little more than a matter of emphasis,
with grav vehicles capable of covering all surfaces of a
world and reaching orbit. At higher Tech Levels, if the air
force remains independent from both army and system
defence forces, it is often referred to as the close orbit
and airspace control command or COACC.

An air force can theoretically exist as early as
TL3, although early balloons and dirigibles are
often operated by other branches of the military.
With the advent of the first fixed wing aircraft at
TL4, independent air forces become a practical
consideration. Past TL10 their functions are often
split between ground and system defence forces. To
determine randomly if an air force exists:

**_Air Force Exists on 4+:_** roll 2D +DMs

Atmosphere 0 or 1 and TL0–8 DM-20
Atmosphere 2, 3 or E and TL0–8 DM-8
Atmosphere 4 or 5 and TL0–8 DM-2
Government 7 DM+4
TL0–2 DM-20
TL3 DM-10
TL10–12 DM-4
TL13+ DM-6

SYSTEM DEFENCE BRANCH


System defence covers a variety of capabilities, from
surface emplacements to multi-thousand ton asteroid-hull monitors armed with spinal weapons. The key
feature of a system defence force is its ability to
fight an opponent in space. This includes planetary
defence missiles, advanced guns, laser installations
and deeply buried meson emplacements. Defence
systems at naval bases are effectively system defence
assets, as are fighters, system defence boats and
larger spacecraft often termed monitors. Monitors
range in size from thousands of tons to multi-hundred
thousand ton asteroid or battle-rider class ships
whose mission is to defend the homeworld.

A system defence branch can theoretically exist as early
as TL6, providing missile defence to a world’s key surface
installations and orbital space. At TL8 and above, practical
warfighting spacecraft and orbital defence stations can
add to system defence capability. Most worlds with this
capability have some sort of system defence branch, at
least for protection of starports and key facilities but all of
these systems are expensive. To randomly determine if a
system defence branch exists:

NAVY BRANCH


In this context a naval branch is a military force capable
of interstellar travel. Not every ship in the naval fleet
need be a starship: support vessels, fighters and even
battle riders might be part of the navy’s complement of
vessels but to differentiate itself from a system defence
force, a navy is jump-capable. This requires TL9 or
greater technology, although in theory early prototypes
at TL7 could function as a crude and expensive jump
drive. A single world only requires an interstellar navy
if it intends to project force outside its star system, or
perhaps to distant corners of its own system where
a jump is the most efficient means of travel. For
functional purposes, a world with its own exploration
service, whether separate or joint, armed or not, is
considered part of the navy. To randomly determine if a
navy branch exists:

**_Navy Exists on 4+:_** roll 2D +DMs

Expansionism 1–5 DM-2
Expansionism 9–B DM+2
Expansionism C+ DM+4
Risk DM+2

MARINE BRANCH


A marine branch is defined as a fighting force equipped
for space combat. Marines may be called ‘security
officers’ or ‘naval infantry’ and might be part of a naval
force structure but their function is to fight battles
aboard ships or on worlds not their own. Army troops
might occupy other worlds but marines are equipped

to establish beachheads, conduct raids and act as the
vanguard of any spaceborne military force. A marine
unit may be attached to either a system defence branch
or a navy branch but if neither is present marines can
in theory still exist, acting as commando troops and
ferried by hired transport or acting as guards on a
world’s merchant shipping or foreign embassies. In
such cases, the size of the marine branch is likely to
be very small, regardless of the Effect. To randomly
determine if a marine branch exists:

**_Marines Exists on 4+:_** roll 2D +DMs

No System Defence DM-6
Expansionism 1–5 DM-4
Expansionism 9–B DM+1
Expansionism C+ DM+2
Risk DM+2

MILITARY BUDGET


Before allocating funds to various military functions, a
world must acquire those funds, either through taxation
or transfer of payments from an outside party. The basic
military budget is equal to 2% of a world’s GWP. On
balkanised worlds, the military budget is almost always
determined independently for each faction or nation
but for expediency a Referee may choose to blend
various DMs to determine an overall world budget.
The amount computed does not necessarily need to
conform to the total percent of GWP spent on military
budget items. On some worlds the allocated money is
not effectively allocated or may be lost to corruption or
other factors. The percent of GWP normally available to
a world, faction or nation to spend on useful equipment,
personnel, facilities and services is:

**_Basic Military Budget% =_**

2% × (1 + )x (1 + )*

*Minimum value of (2D-7+DMs) is -9

A world with Government code 6 uses the DMs of its

The formula assumes a period of general peace for a
world that believes defence is a good investment. If a
world becomes complacent, either through generations
of peace, membership in a large and powerful interstellar
polity whose borders extend 10 or more parsecs
beyond the world or some other complacency factor,
then effective military spending tends to decline. War or
the threat of war has the opposite effect. The following
multipliers apply to the basic military budget:

**State of Readiness Modifiers**

State of Readiness Modifier
Complacent peace ×0.5
Low threat level ×0.75
Normal readiness ×1.0
Heightened tensions, threat of war or
internal uprisings

×1.2

War or internal insurgency ×2.0
Total war: full mobilisation ×5.0

A Referee may adjust or apply other modifiers as
desired. The budget modifiers apply to the current
standard year’s conditions. If determining a capital
budget for existing capital asset composition, the
Referee should adjust the budget to reflect an
average over the course of the assets’ construction
and operational lives.

**_Total Military Budget =_** GWP x Basic Military Budget%

x State of Readiness Modifier

The number determined as the total military budget
is the total pool of money for personnel, equipment
and bases and serves as a comparison value to other
worlds. Half or more of this amount is likely allocated
to personnel costs and overhead, while the remainder
may be available for equipment. If a world’s armed
forces are primarily robotic, the portion spent on
equipment may be higher.

MILITARY PROFILE


The eight functions of a military can be summarised in
an eHex string of the format:

EMAWF-SNM

Where the latter three digits (SNM) represent the
forces available outside the world’s atmosphere:
system defence, navy and marine. This represents
a world’s relative ability to fight in these realms of
operation but it is a relative strength profile which
does not consider actual funding or Tech Level. An
optional addition to the profile is the military budget
percentage added as :#.##%.

BASES


A world may have various associated bases including
navy, scout and military bases. Their existence is
established during the starport determination process
based on the Starport Facilities table on page 194 and
any associated DMs.

If bases exist, they may be associated with the
world itself or a larger interstellar polity. In the latter
case, the world has little influence on the sizing or
capabilities of the base, although it may prove to be
a boon to the local economy. These ‘foreign’ bases
may be co-located with the starport or might not even
be located near the mainworld but elsewhere in the
system. Based on the particulars of the system and
region, the Referee determines whether a base facility
is associated with a larger polity or the mainworld.

The following base profiling sections concern those
bases under the control of the system’s mainworld.
In some cases, these may even share facilities or
support services with an interstellar polity’s bases.
These procedures are only relevant if a base is
already indicated for the system and the base is
owned and operated by the mainworld.

world social characteristics



NAVAL BASE


A naval base is most often a space-based facility:

Existing Naval Base is Space-based on 4+:
Roll 2D + DMs

No Highport DM-2
TL0–7 DM-8
TL8 DM-4

A space-based facility can be constructed as a space
station using High Guard or can be abstracted based
on total tonnage. Abstracted requirements for a naval
base typically include:
•	 Pressurised internal docking tonnage is equal to
three times the size of the largest naval ship in
the fleet.
•	 Additional internal docking tonnage equal to 15% of
total fleet tonnage (including the largest ship).
•	 Multiplier for the station’s required functions = 2 ×
total internal docking space.
•	 Additional tonnage for any weapons systems
specified = 2 × weapon size (turrets, bays and so on).
•	 Enough external docking capacity for 25% of the
fleet based in or out of the base – this is normally
accounted for by the tonnage already allocated, as
a base can accommodate 200% of its total tonnage
in externally docked ships.

Note that for ease of calculation ‘docking tonnage’
means space devoted to internal docking facilities, not
actual internal docking capacity, which would be one-third of this value.

SCOUT BASE


An independent scout base is uncommon, especially
as a separate installation. When present, they are
often referred to as an exploration base instead. For
simplicity, an individual world does not have a separate
scout branch but may allocate a portion of its navy
or even system defence branch (for in-system-only
scouts) spacecraft to a scout base.

As with a naval base, a scout base is likely to be
space-based if a highport exists:

Existing Scout Base is Space-based on 4+:
Roll 2D + DMs

No Highport DM-4
TL0–8 DM-4

An IISS waystation is always space-based. A scout
base has similar requirements to a naval base but
tends to be a leaner facility and is often armed with only
a few defensive weapons. This base can be designed
using High Guard or abstracted. The abstracted
requirements for a scout base are:
•	 Pressurised internal docking tonnage is equal to
three times the size of the largest scout ship in
the fleet.
•	 Additional internal docking tonnage is equal to 10%
of total fleet tonnage (including the largest ship).
•	 Multiplier for the station’s required functions = 2 ×
total internal docking space.
•	 Additional tonnage for any weapons systems
specified = 2 × weapon size (turrets, bays and so on).
•	 Enough external docking capacity for 20% of the
fleet based in or out of the base.

For scout bases, docking tonnage means space
devoted to internal docking facilities, not actual internal
docking capacity, at a third of this value.

MILITARY BASE


A military base is most often a facility owned and
operated by the mainworld. Many worlds will have more
than one military base, perhaps hundreds or thousands
of facilities to support their land, sea and air combat
branches. System defence forces can use an existing
local navy base for support.

Corsair Base
Costs for a corsair base are normally only borne by
a government which is sponsoring the corsair base –
pirates who occupy an uninhabited region and set up
camp are responsible for their own costs. However, the
Referee may rule that the mainworld government is
being extorted into paying for the corsair base upkeep
as ‘protection money’.

There are no standards for corsair bases. The Referee
is free to use any of the base sizing procedures above
or parts of the procedures as desired.

Zed Prime is a balkanised world and its military
budget should be independently determined for its
two factions, if not its seven nations. In the interest
of simplicity, this example will split the population into
the governorship (I) and oligarch (II) factions. The
PGLs, TL and militancy for governorships is 6BA,
TL7 and C, and for oligarchies, 636, TL8 and 6. The
Referee decides to determine what services exist for
_each faction, recording the Effect scores to document
their profile and then calculate the effective military_
budget percentage.
world social characteristics

Starting with the governorships, militancy of C grants
_an overall DM+4. Despite simmering conflicts, the DMs
for insurgency are not in effect but the Referee will
allow specific branch DMs for ‘factional uprisings’._

First, an enforcement branch automatically exists, with
a DM+8 plus the global DM+4 added to the baseline
_Effect of 3, to be 15 – or F – for enforcement effect._

For militia branch existence, the DMs are -10 for Law
Level, +1 for PCR 3 and the standing DM+4 for a
total DM-5. A roll of 11 on 2D is adjusted to 6, which
_is more than 4, so a militia branch exists with Effect 2_ (6-4=2). It is up to the Referee to determine if these
are reserves, self-defence forces, death squads or
potential insurrectionists.

For the army branch, the DMs are -2 for the militia,
+4 for government 7 and +4 for government B, +2 for
factional uprisings, for a total DM of +12. A 2D roll of 4
_still results in an Effect of 12 or C._

For the wet navy, the DM+4 for government 7 applies
for a total DM+8. The roll of 5 means a navy exists with
_Effect9 (5+8-4 = 9), although the Referee decides this_
is more a coast guard and riverine patrol force than a
_‘blue water’ offensive branch._

For an air force branch only the DM +4 for militancy
_applies and a roll of 6 results in an Effect of 6, less_
than both army and navy. The Referee considers this
also an inward and border-focused force and decides
to consolidate both the navy and air force into the
army command structure.

A system defence branch is unlikely at TL7. The faction
does not control the starport so the DM+1 for Class
C does not apply. A DM-6 applies for Tech Level and
applying another DM-4 for the unnecessariness of the
branch (cancelling out militancy), leaves a DM of -6. On a
roll of 9 - 6 = 3, the system defence force does not exist.

A navy is even more unnecessary than a system
defence branch but sometimes dictators and generals
buy prestige items, so examining the DMs, population
6 causes DM-3, TL7 causes DM-8, low expansionism
causes DM-2 and internal heightened tensions are
ignored. This creates a net DM-9, which would never
result in a navy, so no space toys for the governor.

_Finally, a marine branch seems completely superfluous_
and the Referee could just ignore the roll but instead,
examining the DMs, Tech Level causes DM-6, no
navy DM-6, low expansionism DM-4 and the Referee
allows heightened tensions to provide DM+2 because

dropping marines from the sky could help put down an
insurrection. With net DM-10 even after militancy, a roll
can still not succeed, so no marines exist either.

For the aggressive, repressive governorships, the basic
military budget percentage is = 2% × (1 – 2 ÷ 10) × (1
+ (9-7+2+12-5+4-4) ÷ 10) or 3.36% but with internal
unrest present, this becomes 3.04 × 1.2 = 4.032% of
the faction’s share of GWP.

The final results for the governorships are a strong
enforcement branch, a possibly dodgy militia and a
strong army with integral sea and air but no space
defence capabilities. The string of F2C96-000:4.03%
is more than enough to describe the military of
this faction. Going into further detail would only be
necessary to run a mercenary campaign or wargame.

For the less aggressive (6 for a global DM+1), more
peaceful (no heightened tensions) oligarchs, the
enforcement branch is enlarged because of the
disperse population but still only DM+2 and therefore
Effect 5. Going on, the results of several rolls are an
army (6), navy (3), air force (3) and system defence
force (3).The effective military budget percentage is
1.76%. for a string of 50633-300:1.76%. In this case,
as with the other faction, the army is the controlling
force but the system defence force, having jurisdiction
over starport defence, has a few armed cutters for
customs and patrols and a squadron of light fighters to
patrol the gas giant. The budget likely does not allow
for system defence boats.

# Travel Zones
See [[Travel Zones]].  Default is [[Green Zone]], and is rarely indicated as-such.

## Amber Zone

If random determination is desired, the Referee can apply [[Amber Zone]]s with the following results:
  


Amber Zone Exists on 12+:
roll 2D +DMs

Roll 2D +DMs.  [[Amber Zone]] exists on 12+.

|Attribute|DM|
|--|:-:|
| Primordial System | +2 |
| Atmosphere B, C, F+ | +2 |
| Mean temperature above 373K | +2 |
| Mean atmospheric pressure above 50 bar | +2 |
| Seismic stress 100+ | +2 |
| Government 0 | +4 |
| Government 7 | +2 |
| Law Level 0 | +2 |
| Government + Law Level > 20 | +(Government + Law Level - 16) |
| Xenophilia 0–5 | +(6-Xenophilia) |
| Militancy 9+ | +(Militancy-8) |
| Factional uprisings | +2 |
| Ongoing war | +4 |

> Zed Prime has little reason for an [[Amber Zone]] in the oligarchies but the governorships might be an issue. Still, as an off-world reference would be focused on the starport, the Referee chooses to use the DMs for government 7 and factional uprisings, a total DM+4, but not those that would apply only to the governorships, namely the DMs for government + Law Level (+5) or xenophilia (+4) and militancy (+4). A roll of 3 +4 = 7, so no world-wide Amber Zone is randomly indicated. The additional DM+13 for the governorships would result in an automatic Amber Zone for that region. See the [[#Red Zone]] example to see why this makes the Referee change this decision and impose a worldwide Amber Zone after all.

## Red Zone

The placement of a [[Red Zone]] should be a deliberate choice by the Referee but as guide, the following procedure can provide insight as to situations which warrant Red Zone placement:

Roll 2D +DMs.  [[Red Zone]] exists on 12+.

|Attribute|DM|
|--|:-:|
| Magnetar system | +10 |
| Pulsar system | +8 |
| Protostar system | +6 |
| Seismic stress 200+ | +2 |
| Native sophonts of TL0–3 | +4 |
| Xenophilia 1–2 | +6-Xenophilia |
| Militancy C+ | +Militancy-8 |
| Factional uprisings | +2 |
| Ongoing war | +4 |
| Threat or use of WMDs | +8 |

The Referee should never feel bound by these results.

> Zed Prime is provisionally not designated an [[Amber Zone]] but the militancy and unrest of the governorships actually provides a combined DM+6 to the Red Zone roll. The Referee decides to roll to see what travel conditions to this faction would be and rolls a 5. Since 5 + 6 = only 11, a Red Zone does not apply. Still, it is enough for the Referee to reconsider the world’s status and they decide to make the world an [[Amber Zone]] after all, since such a designation is an indication of a third- party’s perception of risk and news stories out of the governorships might be rather grim.

# IISS PROCEDURAL
The detailing of a world’s social attributes requires
more effort and different skills than those necessary to
determine its physical characteristics. For most worlds,
the procedures to gather this data are part of a Class
IV survey. The Second Survey performed full Class
IV surveys on all Imperial and many neighbouring
systems. A survey team gathers their data into a Class
IV Part C data set, sometimes called the census data
set but the teams and methodologies for gathering
this data vary according to three different operational
procedures. These three specific procedures are for
surveys of member worlds of the Third Imperium,
surveys of contacted worlds outside Imperial borders
and surveys of uncontacted worlds.

**INTERNAL BRANCH SURVEYS**
The survey office’s internal mapping branch is
responsible for surveys of worlds within the Third
Imperium. Performing a social survey or a census
of an Imperial world is theoretically straightforward.
The Scout Service has clear authority to conduct
the survey and the world is obligated to provide the
required information. However, the IISS cannot simply
gather a set of data from the local authorities and
move onto the next system. There are a number of
reasons for this: the data may be of poor quality, out-of-date, too low Tech Level format to be easily usable (a TL1 world may have records on scrolls or stone
tablets) and it may be intentionally misleading.

To ensure the census data is accurate, the survey
team has access to local Imperial authorities such as
nobles and starport authority personnel, as well as any
detached duty scouts residing on or visiting the world.
Even properly formatted up-to-date data is checked
by random sampling, interviews and orbital scans. If
the data is found to be statistically accurate, that helps
with demographic information but does not necessarily
establish more subtle cultural information. The Scout
Service relies on observation, questionnaires and
scoring procedures to determine such things as cultural
diversity, progressiveness and militancy.

A potential complication specific to internal surveys
is the appeals process. After gathering and analysing
the census data, the operational team presents it to
both the Scout Service Operations Office and to the
local government. If the local government finds the
data ‘objectionable’, it can, and often will, appeal the
findings through their noble representative and ask for
an arbitration by the nobility. These appeals are rarely
successful on more concrete factors such as population
and GWP statistics but on subtler cultural descriptions,
the local nobility sometimes asks the Scout Service to
temper some ‘objectionable’ findings of more qualitative
measurements. The introduction of the development
score during the Second Survey resulted in many
appeals but the simplicity of the measure and its tie
back to statistically valid efficiency factors from a
database of more than 11,000 systems made most of
these appeals doomed to failure.

The Second Survey ensured census data was
statistically correct as of the time period 995–1065,
but that in itself was a 70 year span. More concrete
data such as population and GWP is regularly updated
but the cultural data for many systems even within
the Imperium has not been verified since the Second
Survey teams departed the system.

EXTERNAL BRANCH SURVEYS


Systems near the Imperial borders that have already
been contacted and are aware of interstellar society are
surveyed by the survey office’s external mapping branch.
The level of contact varies from Imperial client states with
strong ties to the Third Imperium to systems that have not
been officially contacted by the Imperium in centuries. Such
distant systems may have regular contact with Imperial
citizens – traders, explorers, adventurers, renegades – but
the further from the Imperial border and the less significant
the system, the less likely the Imperium is to maintain
any sort of diplomatic contact. Still, all of the worlds under
external mapping branch purview are at least aware that
the Third Imperium exists, although they may have little
idea of its actual scope and powers.

world social characteristics



The job of an external mapping branch census
gatherer is theoretically more difficult than that of those
who conduct surveys inside the Imperium but the
procedures employed are actually more standardised.
No data is trusted, so it is more a process of
determining the data from direct observation. Statistical
sampling methods can determine population and
economic output. Outreach teams conduct direct
and indirect observation of the local culture and
derive information from conditions on the ground.
When the local population is friendly, this is generally
straightforward but scout teams are careful to look past
the view of the world as orchestrated by ‘handlers’ or
local officials. If a world’s authorities or population are
overtly hostile to the census team, direct contact is
limited and the accuracy of the information gathered
is ‘best effort’ backed up by statistical models derived
from thousands of systems and years of cultural data.
If detached duty scouts are in system or have visited
recently, their experiences are mined for information.
The census team also interviews other Imperial citizens
or friendly outsiders to corroborate or correct data
gathered by indirect means.

One advantage of an external survey is that it is not
subject to appeal. While a client state might attempt
to influence findings through diplomatic or economic
means, such attempts rarely gain traction and at best
allow the objecting system to host and attempt to
influence a second scout team usually backed by an
Imperial diplomatic representative. Worlds far from the
Imperium in distance and influence may never even see
the results of the survey, much less contest the data.

CONTACT AND LIAISON BRANCH SURVEYS


Contact procedures for a new sophont species are the
same as those for an existing sophont species that
has been long isolated, whether a minor human race
or lost colony. It is a cautious process carried out by
the exploration office’s contact and liaison branch. As
the Imperium grew, it absorbed most regions isolated
by the Long Night. The exploration cruiser expeditions
sent far beyond Imperial borders were common in the
first few centuries of the exploration office’s existence
but became infrequent after the civil war. New first
contact situations became uncommon and when the
Second Survey began, the major focus of the contact
and liaison branch had shifted to internal relations
between the various species and cultures inside the
Imperium. Still, a cadre of dedicated first contact teams
operate far beyond Imperial borders and in unexplored
rifts and backwaters, making first contact with people
who have never heard of the Third Imperium and might
not even know they live on a sphere and not on the
back of a cosmic turtle.

Whenever possible, first contact begins with covert
operations. If the inhabitants of a newly explored
system are not spacefaring, this is simply a matter
of remaining in space at far orbit and observing. A
civilisation of TL5 and below has little capability to
detect a ship in distant orbit, much less to react with
effective hostility. If the uncontacted natives have space
travel observation is even more careful, with detection
and tracking of local system traffic a priority for active
concealment and avoidance procedures.

If the natives are advanced enough to broadcast radio
or television signals, the contact team can attempt to
learn the local language and some customs through
remote reconnaissance. Lower Tech Level worlds
require landings in remote regions and surreptitious
recon operations on the ground to gather data. The
team leaders use this data to determine if an attempt
at first contact is warranted or safe, both for the contact
team and the local civilisation. For a strictly survey
operation, especially on a world of TL5 or less, contact
is not usually recommended. For more advanced
locals, the team must gauge the level of hostility and
probable reaction to first contact.

In the early days of the Imperium, the emphasis was
on making this first contact, introducing the Imperium to
the locals and making a case for Imperial membership.
This emphasis had ended by the time of the civil war.
By the seventh century, the Imperium was no longer
expanding. Contacts with other cultures still occurred,
especially where political consideration favoured
gaining friendly local allies. However such contact
decisions usually occurred after a Class IV covert
survey report arrived on an Imperial administrator’s
desk and a contact mission received approval.

The initial scout contact team retains great latitude in
making decisions far from Imperial borders and may
proceed with contact after deliberation but as they
are far from Imperial support, they must weigh the
benefits and risks of their actions. If the local natives
have had any known previous interstellar contacts that
had good outcomes, the team is likely to recommend
proceeding with contact. If known previous contacts
ended in hostilities, the team is likely to report back to
base without establishing contact and to return only if
adequately supported.

Class IV Part C Form
The standard display form for a Class IV social or
census survey assumes the completion of a physical
survey and may or may not display the header
information related to the Part P form. Some balkanised
worlds may have a worldwide Part C, followed by
separate Part C forms for each faction or government.

CORELLA


Corella’s census details can be worked out with this
chapter’s processes. From Spinward Extents, little more
is known than the UWP – A864855-D – and that great

houses are a dominant power in some sort of senatorial
government. The results of the creation process for the
social details are noted in Corella, IV Part-C form.

Comments


The star system creation rules work well for main
sequence stars in the middle of their life, the most
common hosts to habitable worlds. Stars in their
infancy, stars technically ‘dead’ and objects with
pretensions but not the mass to become stars
require specialised rules. Sections in this chapter will
detail procedural changes required for these types
of objects. These rules are especially important if
the special object is the primary or only ‘star’ in the
system and others still may appear in hexes otherwise
described as ‘empty’.

EMPTY HEXES


Systems listed on Travellermap are almost all hosted
by at least one star, very few have brown dwarf or
white dwarf primary stars, despite the former being
possibly as numerous as stars and the latter account
for perhaps one sixth of all stars. These systems of
failed or dead stars and their attendants are present
in systems not noted on standard charts. On a
commercial subsector or sector map, they occupy
‘empty’ hexes. Even in hexes empty of star-like
objects such as these, other large bodies – rogue
planets tossed from their systems in their youth
by unruly neighbouring worlds – are at least as
common as planets within a system. Untold billions
of planetoids and comet-like objects pepper the
darkness. However a hex is a parsec across, more
than 30 cubic light-years and even with a billion rocks,
a handful of planets and maybe a failed or dead star
or two, any random point in the darkness is effectively
empty. The Scout Service has sensors to probe these
depths and charts of some of these objects but most
remain unexplored and many are undiscovered.

The Scout Service has mapped all of the empty hexes
within the Third Imperium to a level of SI 8, detecting
most objects down to gas giant size. Their databases
of nearby regions are mostly complete to SI 4,
detecting all brown dwarfs and some very large or
young gas giants. In those neighbouring regions, the
coverage from exploration and survey expeditions and
from surreptitious finds of smaller objects is variable
and not always reliable.

# S CIRCUMSTANCES

## PECIAL

OBJECT TYPES


A variety of objects can be present in ‘empty’ hexes.
The smaller the object the higher the probability and/or
quantity of its potential existence.

Rogue Neutron Stars and Black Holes
While neutron stars spinning as pulsars and black holes
in binary systems are easy to detect from thousands
of parsecs away, lone dead stars are a tougher find.
A black hole that is not feeding is at best a blank spot
on a star field but at only a few kilometres or maybe
tens of kilometres across, it is as hard to detect visually
as a random rogue planetoid. A neutron star is easier
to detect, since it still emits light very brightly in the
ultraviolet spectrum to start with but it cools over time
and is no larger than tens of kilometres across, making
it a difficult object to find. These objects are more
prevalent than most people imagine: consider, for every
supergiant star currently shining, more than 1,000
neutron star remnants of previous generations of these
massive stars are roaming the galaxy. Black holes may
be less common by a factor of 19 or more but they too
exist in the darkness. See the Dead Stars section for
detailed neutron star and black hole generation.

White Dwarf Primaries
An otherwise empty hex may be host to a white dwarf
primary star system. This is defined as either a lone
white dwarf or a system where the other ‘stars’ are only
white dwarfs and/or brown dwarfs. Sometimes white
dwarfs may exist in the centre of a planetary nebula but
most are slowly cooling objects, sometimes surrounded
by the debris or survivors of their former planetary
systems. See the Dead Stars section (pages 227-228)
for detailed white dwarf generation.

Brown Dwarf Primaries
A brown dwarf has the same probability of occupying
an empty hex as a system has of existing in that
region. A single roll at the region’s system density
level will determine the existence of a brown dwarf.
A brown dwarf primary may be part of a multi-brown
dwarf system and/or may host a small planetary
system. See the Brown Dwarf section (page 227) for
detailed brown dwarf generation.



Rogue Gas Giants
A rogue gas giant (or several) may exist within a
hex but might be difficult to find without equipment,
patience and luck. Each size of gas giant is a separate
roll or set of rolls based on stellar density. These
worlds can be generated as standard gas giants using
the gas giant sizing rules on page 55. Rogue gas
giants have a DM-1 per dice on the Significant Moon
Count table on page 55.

Rogue Terrestrial Worlds
An empty hex very likely has rogue planet-sized
objects floating about. However, finding them can be
a challenge. These may be generated as terrestrial
planets, with large terrestrials determining size with
1D+9, and small terrestrials determining size by
2D-2, but with 0 treated as 1 andA (10) treated as 9.
Their position of origin in a star system is somewhat
random, so they have a negative DM of 1D-1 on the
Terrestrial Composition table on page 71. Terrestrial
worlds larger than Size 2 have a fixed DM-2 on the
Significant Moon Count table.

Rogue Small Bodies
Empty space is littered with small bodies. One could
be discovered every time their detection threshold for
the hex is reached. For each object, roll 1D: on a 6, it is
size S, otherwise it is a single Size 0 rock. A further roll
of 1D indicates likely composition: on 1–2 it is mostly
icy, on 3–5 it has some water content but it requires
mining to extract, on a 6 it is bone dry and useless as
a fuel source. This composition determination cannot
be made remotely with any degree of certainty. Once
a ship jumps to this distant spec, on a roll of 9+, the
actual composition must be rolled again.

PROBABILITIES


The likelihood of the presence of objects in empty
hexes depends on the star density of the region of
space. In standard density regions of space, a system
exists in a hex on a roll of 4+ on 1D. When checking
for rarer objects in empty hexes, a roll for the possibility
of the object’s existence precedes any roll based on
the region’s system existence check. For instance, a
hex has a one-in-six chance of possibly containing a
white dwarf. If this first roll is successful, a second roll
for the actual existence of the object follows, based on
the density of the region. Brighter and larger objects
are easier to detect but finding dimmer objects, such
as gas giants or smaller planets requires specialised
equipment, time and luck.

For simplicity, except in dense star clusters, an empty
hex will have only one system with star-like objects:
black holes, neutron stars, white dwarfs or brown
dwarfs. For any one hex, the Referee should first roll
for neutron stars and black holes, then for white dwarfs
and then for brown dwarfs. Rogue planets are more
common and can coexist in any hex. If desired, the
Referee could even place such rogue planets in hexes
already occupied by star systems.

For each ‘empty’ hex, the process is:

1. Determine if a neutron star or black hole might
    exist. Roll 3D: possible existence on an 18.
a. If yes, check if a neutron star or black hole actually
exists. Roll the region’s system existence check.
2. If yes, roll 2D: on an 11 or 12 the object is a black
    hole, otherwise it is a neutron star.
a. If the hex is still empty, determine if a white dwarf
might exist. Roll 1D: possible existence on a 6.
3. If yes, check if a white dwarf exists. Roll the region’s
    system existence check to place a white dwarf.
a. If the hex is still empty, determine if a brown
dwarf exists. Roll the region’s system existence
check to place a brown dwarf system.
4. Even if one of the above star-like objects exists,
    for any hex:
a. Determine if a rogue large gas giant exists: roll
the region’s system existence check.
b. Determine if rogue medium gas giants exist: roll
the region’s system existence check two times.
c. Determine if rogue small gas giants exist: roll the
region’s system existence check three times.
d. Determine if large terrestrial worlds exist: roll the
region’s system existence check four times.
e. Determine if small terrestrial worlds exist: roll
the regions system existence check 10 times.

A hex will have an effectively unlimited number of
smaller objects floating about. The Referee need
only check for the existence of one of these objects
in a search area immediately prior to the Traveller’s
detection check roll. These checks are only necessary
if the Travellers are planning to search an empty hex
for objects or if they become aware that a certain class
of object exists in that hex.

On the Empty Hex Objects Table, the SI column
indicates the completeness of surveying and charting
necessary to detect these objects. A commercial
map will not necessarily chart any of these objects; a
scout service publicly available dataset for sectors in
Imperial space will include almost all objects to SI 4.
Some objects may be redacted for security reasons.
special circumstances


A scout service-only map will include all detected
and charted objects down to SI 12 but this is not a
complete survey of every rogue planet and small
body in the Imperium. It is merely a catalogue of all
charted objects with known and verified coordinates
and vectors. Some of this information may be decades
or centuries old, and a slight error in either location
or vector could result in the object being lost until
rediscovered. Astrogators know not to trust charts if
risking a jump to a rogue in empty space, as even a
small error could leave the ship fatally stranded.

DETECTION


The Empty Hex Objects table’s Detection column
indicates the number of detection points required to
make a detection roll in a single hex for the object
type using sensors or observatories from one parsec
distant. Once the indicated number of points is
accumulated, a sensor operator or astronomer may
make a detection check, and if successful the Referee
can check the Existence Probability column to see
if an object was actually detected. Either sensors of
military grade or better or an observatory is necessary
to accumulate hourly detection points.

Detectors

Detector TL Detection Points per hour Notes
Military Grade Sensors 10 0

Improved Sensors 12 1

Advanced Sensors 15 2
Superior Sensors 16 3

Observatories 7–13 1–3 × Effect Multiplier Depends on size and TL, see DSE p.24



Sensors require the Electronics (sensors) skill
to operate and observatories require Science (astronomy), though a person with either skill can
operate the opposite technology at skill level -1. An
automated search requires a computer running Intellect
and an Expert/2 software package for the appropriate
skill. Options and distance will affect the capabilities of
these detectors with applicable DMs applied to each
hour’s detection points.

Once a sensor scan has accumulated enough
detection points, the sensor operator may attempt an
Average (8+) Electronics (sensor) check (1 hour, INT or
EDU) to detect the object – if it exists – and determine
its coordinates. For observatories, the relevant check
uses Science (astronomy) skill instead but as with
accumulating detection points, these Electronics
and Science specialties can be used on ‘opposite’
equipment with a DM-1 to the check.

Ideally, the Referee should make this check hidden
from the Traveller and should not tell the Traveller
whether an object actually exists, only that the check
succeeded for an existing object. If the Traveller has
access to charts indicating something should be there,
Travellers can make the roll themselves – unless the
Referee determines the chart is wrong.

An Effect of 2+ is needed to initially determine a
detected object’s vector, without which a jump to its
location suffers a DM-8 if it occurs within one month
of detection, a further DM-1 for every month thereafter

and a further DM-4 for every parsec distant. Since
the object in question is likely at least a large fraction
of a parsec distant, the detection of its location is
months or years in the past. If the sensor operator
wishes to determine the detected object’s vector with
greater certainty, a second roll at least one week after
initial detection can provide that information and any
success, meaning both first and second detection rolls
have an Effect of at least 0, indicating a high probability
of capturing the correct data.

Detection points are accumulated for all objects in a
particular hex. A general scan of a parsec hex will allow
the sensor operator to attempt to detect one object of
each type once the sensors have accumulated enough
points to detect that type of body. For instance, a roll
for brown dwarfs occurs after 20 detection points are
accumulated. If the detection fails, it will require another
20 points to attempt another detection check for a
brown dwarf (assuming one exists). Once 60 points
are accumulated, a single attempt at detecting a large
gas giant can occur and by that point a third attempt
to find the brown dwarf can also occur. If the Referee
makes these rolls in secret, it allows the Traveller to
hold out dwindling hope that a brown dwarf might exist.
At 80 points, the first attempt to detect a medium gas
giant can occur – as well as a rare neutron star or black
hole. This is also the point of the fourth try to find brown
dwarf, if one exists. At 120 points, a second attempt to
find a large gas giant occurs and if by this sixth attempt
to find a brown dwarf, the Traveller will likely assume
that none are present in the hex. Still, detection is

entirely independent of existence: the Referee makes
the existence rolls first and no amount of detection can
find something that is not there.

**JUMPING TO ‘EMPTY’ HEXES**
Jumping to hexes not marked as containing star
systems is risky. Even if a large gravitational anchor
such as a white or brown dwarf is present, a jump
is more hazardous than normal. Some jump-space
theorists believe this is an effect from the paucity of
neutrino emissions from ‘stars’ not fusing hydrogen but
regardless of cause, such jumps are inherently riskier.

Jumps to smaller mass targets such as gas giants
or terrestrial planets become increasingly risky
and less precise as mass decreases. Jumps to the
smallest targets add another factor of risk: far from
a gravitational anchor, manoeuvre drive thrusters do
not have a local gravity well to interact with and will
operate at less than 1% efficiency, relying only on their
interaction with the galaxy’s overall gravity gradient.
Ships designed to operate far from normal stars are
either equipped with fuel-hungry reaction drives or a
power-hungry deep space manoeuvre system (DSMS

- see Deepnight Revelation Campaign Guide (Book 2),
page 33) capable of creating a local field to ‘bootstrap’
a standard manoeuvre drive.

If just jumping to deep space to cross a rift or gap in a
multi-jump transit, for instance when making two single
parsec jumps in a free trader to cross a two-parsec
gap, using extra fuel tanks to initiate a second jump
from deep space to the destination, the accuracy of the
intermediate jump is less important and the additional
step below is not necessary.

An accurate jump to an empty hex adds an additional
step to the jump task chain. As usual, the process
begins with the initial Easy (4+) Astrogation check (1D × 10 minutes, EDU) with DM-1 for each parsec
to the destination. The astrogator is aware of the
success or failure of this check and may try again on
a failure. Once successful, this check provides a task

chain modifier to the Easy (4+) Engineer (j-drive)
check (1D × 10 minutes, EDU) with normal DMs and
chances for misjump.

The extra step for a jump to a specific location in
the ‘empty hex’ requires the astrogator to make an
additional instantaneous Astrogation check. This check
is normally Easy (4+) but if the astrogator made the first
check hurried or carefully, this task becomes Routine (6+) or Simple (2+) respectively. This check uses the
same modifiers as the earlier check, but the target
destination adds a further DM to this second check:

White dwarf, brown dwarf DM-2
Neutron star, black hole, gas giant DM-3
Terrestrial planet (Size 1+) DM-4
Asteroid, comet, station, deep space DM-6
Effect of a misjump DM-Effect × 2
Use of prepared jump template DM+4

This Astrogation check can also benefit from any task
chain DM from the initial Astrogation check. A prepared
jump template solution to a known deep space location
such as a jump bridge, fuel depot or other station may
be available for purchase (usually 1D × Cr100) at a
Class A or B starport in an adjacent hex. Such solutions
‘degrade’ every full week after generation by DM-1. A
ship can generate its own template – only if it knows
the precise current coordinates of the target – by
running its Jump/x program with 10 extra Bandwidth for
2D hours. The precision required to run this program
requires input of astrogation data from a ship that has
visited the target within the last month.

The Effect of the Astrogation check determines the
precision of arrival at the destination. A destination
location is computed as ‘diameters’ if the target is a
Size S dwarf planet or larger object. Otherwise, the
‘planned location’ is a point in space near an asteroid,
comet or artificial body and distance is in kilometres.

STAR TYPE AND MASS


A protostar primary star has its star type
determined with a roll on the Star Type
table with DM+1. If the primary star is a
protostar, any other stars in the system are
also protostars. The variance for protostar
mass is +50%. The characteristics of the
protostar era of a star’s evolution varies
with mass. Smaller T Tauri-type stars
continue to collapse for about 10 million
years. Larger stars massing 2-8 are
known as Herbig Ae/Be stars and burn
brighter, generally sweeping away their
gas disks earlier. Even more massive
stars do not undergo a protostar period at

When emerging in an empty hex far from the benefits
of a stellar or planetary gravity well, a ship’s m-drive
will only achieve a small percentage of its rated thrust
as indicated in the table below. Once it reaches the
threshold distance of a closer limit column, performance
improves as indicated on the nearer column.

For reference, 1D from an object is measured from
the centre of an object and extends to half a diameter
above the body’s surface. 1,000D from Sol is about
9.3AU, nearly the orbit of Saturn and 1,000,000D
from Sol is about 0.0475 or 1/21 parsecs. Beyond this
distance, the galactic background efficiency of 0.1% or
one-thousandth of normal thrust applies throughout all
empty hexes. In intergalactic space, drive efficiency is
theoretically even smaller but still not zero.

PROTOSTAR SYSTEMS


A protostar is a star still in the process of formation. It
burns brightly and erratically but its energy is mostly
generated from the gravitational collapse. Planets are
still in the process of formation, voraciously accreting
gas, dust and larger clumps of materials. Protostar
systems are hazardous to enter with random changes
in stellar luminosity and a high chance of collision
with debris. Smaller worlds are subject to shattering
collisions and larger worlds are covered in oceans of
magma or surrounded by blistering gas.

all, quickly burning away their gas disks and entering
their short main sequence lives almost immediately.
For simplicity, this book will assume a duration of 10
million years for the protostar era of all stars of less
than 8 mass.

DIAMETER AND LUMINOSITY


To simulate the random behaviour of protostars, treat
their type and subtype as similar Class V stars but
multiply the diameter of the protostar star by 1 + (2D-2) ÷ 10. Changes in diameter will affect luminosity
by a factor of the square of the change in diameter.
These changes can occur as often as 1D months
from a previous change and are not predictable from
interstellar distances.

JUMP RESTRICTIONS


A jump into a protostar system suffers from
considerable risks. The star is inherently unstable,
with diameter and luminosity randomly shifting. The
quantity of protoplanetary debris can cause numerous
random jump shadows and blind spots. Any jump into
a protostar system follows the procedures for jumping
into an empty hex but with a DM-6 and an additional
DM-1D to the Astrogation check. Additionally, jumps
both into and out of a protostar system receive DM-4
on the Engineer (j-drive) skill check.

**PLANETARY SYSTEM**
The planetary system of a protostar is still forming.
Determine the actual age of the system using the
Special and Unusual Object Age by Type table on
page 22. Then generate a system of orbits and
worlds using standard procedures modified by the
following conditions:
•	 All rolls for eccentricity receive a DM+2.
•	 All orbital slots with a gas giant or terrestrial planet
also receive a planetoid belt in the same orbital slot.
•	 If the system is less than two million years old,
only large gas giants have fully formed. Medium
gas giants are considered small gas giants. All
other orbits are occupied by vast planetoid belts
with hundreds of Size S and Size 1 bodies. No
significant moons have formed and all existing
gas giants have their own vast ring systems.
These rings can be treated as extending out to 2D
planetary diameters.
•	 If the system is a least two million years old,
most gas giants have formed, although they are
still in the process of accretion. Medium gas
giants have grown to their full size and small gas
giants exist. All gas giants are still surrounded by
disks of material but moons have started to form
inside these disks.
•	 The maximum size of a terrestrial planet or moon
in a protostar system is equal to the system’s age
in million years. If a terrestrial planet of greater
size is indicated, additional protoplanetary chunks
still exist within the surrounding planetoid belt. For
every difference between final size and the current
size as indicated by age, roll another planet of
Size 1D-1 smaller than the current maximum size
and place it in the same orbital slot with spread
variance and DM+2 eccentricity.
•	 Planetary atmospheres are rolled with DM+4 but
any result of 2–5 becomes A and any roll of 6–C
becomes C. A roll of D–F becomes F, and a roll of
G or H becomes H.
•	 Planetary surfaces begin as covered in magma

- liquid rock. This is technically Hydrographics A
but could be treated as 0. For planets of Size 2 or
greater, the surface cools at a rate where a solid
crust can form after (Size - 2)^2 + 2 million years.
•	 The surface temperature of a world with liquid
magma oceans is more than 1,500K.
•	 None of these worlds have recognisable native life.

PRIMORDIAL SYSTEMS


A primordial system is a star system younger than 100
million years but beyond its protostar stage (if any).
In these systems, planets have formed but debris is
still widespread and larger bodies are still covered

in molten magma oceans heated by radioactivity,
gravitational contraction and the occasional massive
impact. Stars of greater than 8 mass immediately
enter the primordial system stage and spend their
entire main sequence lives in this primordial state.
Stars of less than this mass enter this state after they
exit the protostar phase at an age of 10 million years.

All stars of Class Ia, Ib and II and all O-type stars (except O subdwarf stars) are automatically hosts to
primordial systems.

JUMP RESTRICTIONS


A star system in the primordial state is still filled
with debris but constant output from stellar fusion
of hydrogen stabilises the star’s energy output and
diameter, making the jump safer. A jump into a
primordial system imposes a DM-2 to both Astrogation
and Engineer (j-drive) checks.

PLANETARY SYSTEM


By the time a system reaches the age of 10 million
years, the stars have ‘cleared’ gas and dust from the
system, leaving behind larger particles of debris and
still-cooling worlds. Determine the actual age of the
system using the Special and Unusual Object Age by
Type table on page 22. Then generate a system of
orbital slots and worlds using standard procedures
modified by the following conditions:
•	 All rolls for eccentricity receive a DM+1.
•	 The roll for planetoid belt existence (see page 37)
receives a DM+4.
•	 All planetoid belt spans (see page 72) are double
and may overlap other planetary or planetoid belt
orbits.
•	 The maximum size of a terrestrial planet or moon
in a primordial system is equal to the system’s age
in million years. If a terrestrial planet of greater
size is indicated, then additional protoplanetary
chunks still exist within the planet’s orbital space.
For every difference between final size and the
current size as indicated by age, roll another
planet of Size 1D smaller than the current
maximum size and place it in the same orbital slot
with spread variance and DM+2 eccentricity.
•	 All orbital slots with planets (gas giant or
terrestrial) may have an additional planet. Roll 1D
and on a 6, a planet of Size 1D exists within the
same basic orbit. Roll for the actual Orbit# using
a spread variance and add DM+3 to this new
planet’s eccentricity roll.
•	 Planetary atmospheres are rolled with DM+2
but any result of 2–7 becomes A, results of 8–C
become C, D–F become F, and G or H become H.

special circumstances



•	 Planetary surfaces of large worlds may still be
covered by an ocean of magma. Treat magma
oceans as Hydrographics A or 0. For planets of Size
2 or greater, the surface cools at a rate where a solid
crust can form after (Size - 2)^2 + 2 million years.
•	 The surface temperature of a world with liquid
magma oceans is more than 1,500K.
•	 None of these worlds have recognisable native life.

BROWN DWARFS


Brown dwarfs are sometimes called failed stars. They
are not massive enough to fuse regular hydrogen
in their cores but can fuse deuterium, a heavier and
much rarer form of hydrogen. The mass limits for
brown dwarfs are based on this characteristic ability
but varying composition can blur both upper and lower
mass limits and so the distinction between star, brown
dwarf and planet is occasionally one of convenience
and consistency rather than dependency on the
actual physical processes occurring in the core of
these intermediate bodies. Likewise, temperature and
luminosity can exceed the parameters indicated below,
especially for massive young brown dwarfs which
technically glow as hot and bright as some late M-type
stars. For clarity these brown dwarfs are treated in this
book as L-type brown dwarfs. The default Traveller
designation for all brown dwarfs is ‘BD’, but the Referee
may choose to record them by their specific types: L,
T, and Y, followed by a numeric subtype but without a
Class Roman numeral.

DENEB AND OTHER ALTERED SYSTEMS


In Charted Space, the A2 Ia star Deneb
is clearly too young to support an evolved
planetary system, especially one that
hosts a semi-habitable world with a ‘native’
sophont species. Systems such as Deneb
are ‘impossible’ via known natural processes
but that does not make them impossible in a
particular universe. These must be assumed
to have been modified by the Ancients or
some other powerful long-vanished species for
inscrutable reasons. The Referee can as always
override ‘natural’ system formation rules and
insert, move or remove planets to fit the setting
but should have at least a vague idea of what
intervention created the situation.

BROWN DWARF CHARACTERISTICS


Brown dwarf masses generally range between
0.013 and 0.085 but composition details can
blur these distinctions, especially at the margins. To
determine mass:

**_Brown Dwarf Mass(_** **ʘ** **_) =_** +

Most brown dwarfs have the same diameter as large
gas giant (0.1) but may decrease in diameter by
about 20% near 0.06 mass. The Referee can use the
same diameter roll as for large gas giants on the Gas
Giant Sizing table (2D+6⊕) with DM-2 for brown dwarfs
between 0.05 and 0.07 mass.

The largest brown dwarfs begin life as L-type objects.
Brown dwarfs of smaller mass begin or pass through
types T and Y, with the smallest and oldest Y-type
brown dwarfs being cool enough to host liquid
water. The Brown Dwarf Types table summarises
brown dwarfs based on mass and temperature at an
approximate age of one billion years.

Brown Dwarf Types
Type Temperature Mass Diameter Luminosity
L0 2,400K 0.080 0.10 0.00029
L5 1,850K 0.060 0.08 0.000066
T0 1,300K 0.050 0.09 0.000020
T5 900K 0.040 0.11 0.0000070
Y0 550K 0.025 0.10 0.00000081
Y5 300K 0.013 0.10 0.000000072

Over the course of the lifespan of the universe, a
0.08 mass brown dwarf would cool from L0 to about
L9, but smaller mass brown dwarfs would cool faster.
More precise luminosity determination can use the
Luminosity Formula from page 20. The Referee may
model aging brown dwarfs by three different methods,
depending on accuracy desired:
a. Use the table as-is based on the approximate mass
of the brown dwarf.
b. Interpolate a more precise subtype and
temperature based on the mass.
c. Adjust down one or more rows for the temperature
and luminosity of an aging brown dwarf.
d. Reduce the effective subclass and therefore
temperature of the brown dwarf by one subtype per
billion years for brown dwarfs above 0.05 mass
and by two subtypes for smaller brown dwarfs.

**JUMP RESTRICTIONS**
If a system hosts no ‘normal’ stars, the Empty Hex
Jump DMs table affects jumps to brown dwarf systems.
If the brown dwarf is a member of a star system that
contains at least one normal hydrogen-burning star, no
such restrictions apply.

**PLANETARY SYSTEM**
A brown dwarf planetary system is determined using
standard procedures in the Systems and Worlds
chapter, with these exceptions:
•	 The check to see if a gas giant is absent is 8+
instead of the standard 10+. Alternatively, a gas
giant is only present on a roll of 7 or less.
•	 The minimum available Orbit# (MAO) around a
brown dwarf is 0.005.

DEAD STARS


After spending the majority of their lives in the main
sequence, most stars swell to become giant stars and
then expel their outer layers and, after a brief moment
of existence at the core of a planetary nebula, settle
into a boring existence as a slowly cooling white
dwarf stellar remanent. Stars of more than 8 mass
end their lives in a supernova explosion, leaving
behind either a neutron star, black hole or nothing at
all. Despite the scorching giant phase and possibly
explosive end of life event, planets can exist around
these dead stars. In fact, the very first exoplanets
discovered orbit around a pulsar star, a young neutron
star which rotates extremely fast, casting intense radio
waves from its magnetic fields.

Dead stars fall into three categories, white dwarfs,
neutron stars (including pulsars and magnetars) and
black holes.

WHITE DWARFS


Stars that mass less than eight times Sol at the end
of their giant star phase end their lives by shedding
outer layers, briefly forming a planetary nebula around
their scorching hot cores and slowly cooling over time.

Different spectral lines indicating surface composition
are used to determine subtypes of white dwarfs, usually
expressed in additional letters after the ‘D’ designation.
Traveller uses a simple D designation for all white
dwarfs. A white dwarf star can have a maximum mass
of about 1.44. Above this limit, they will detonate in a
Type Ia supernova explosion. To determine actual mass:

**_White Dwarf Mass(_** ʘ **_) = +_**

White dwarf diameters follow an inverse mass
distribution and have diameters similar to those of
terrestrial planets:

**_White Dwarf Diameter(_** ʘ **_) =_** x 0.01 

White dwarf temperatures decrease as they age,
cooling from over 100,000K to about 4,000K. Most
observed white dwarf temperatures range from
40,000K to 8,000K, but these are the brightest.
A median mass white dwarf (0.6) may cool to
7,000K after 1.5 billion years and to 6,000K after
another 0.7 billion but requires another billion
to cool another 500 degrees. Larger mass white
dwarfs will take longer to cool.

The White Dwarf Aging table provides very rough
temperature guidelines to allow for interpolation of
white dwarf temperatures and resultant luminosity by
billions of years since the white dwarf formed. This
table is based on a white dwarf of mass 0.6. To
determine the temperature value for different masses
multiple the resultant temperature by Mass ÷ 0.6.

NEUTRON STARS


Stars massive enough to die in a supernova explosion
but not big enough to form a resultant black hole
become neutron stars. While most neutron stars are
aging and quiescent, newly formed neutron stars may
be pulsars or magnetars. The Traveller designation for
a neutron star is NS.

PULSAR


A pulsar is a fast-rotating neutron star emitting strong
radio pulses with each sub-second rotation. Most
known neutron stars are pulsars, but most pulsars (not
all) will slow down and lose theirradio wave emissions
after 100 million years, making them harder to detect.
Of all the neutron stars in existence since the origin
of the universe, likely only one in 100 is a pulsar. The
Traveller designation for a pulsar is PSR.

MAGNETAR


A magnetar is a sub-class of neutron star with an
extremely strong magnetic field; it may or may not
also be a pulsar. Magnetars are rare. Although 10% of
neutron stars may begin life as a magnetar, they are
usually only active for about 10,000 years and so over
the course of the galaxy’s age, all but one in a million
have already shut down to become a more common
pulsar or neutron star.

NEUTRON STAR CHARACTERISTICS


A neutron star’s mass is generally greater than a white
dwarf and less than a black hole. Neutron stars more
massive than 2.16 will continue to collapse, becoming
black holes. To determine mass:

**_Neutron Star Mass (_** ʘ **_) =_** 1 + ,

on a roll of 6 add

Regardless of mass, all neutron stars have a similar
diameter of 20–25 kilometres. This can be generated
as 19 +1D kilometres, if necessary.

Neutron stars cool not so much from radiating
photons (heat) as more normal objects might but, at
least initially, primarily by neutrino emissions. From
a starting temperature of one million degrees, a
neutron star cools very rapidly at first but over time
its small radiative surface will slow its rate of cooling.
Nevertheless, its very small diameter means that even
a very hot neutron star does not provide much heat.
For pulsars, radiation and magnetic fields are likely
greater hazards to be concerned with, and habitability
of any worlds is not an issue for consideration. A
neutron star’s temperature profile can be approximated
using the White Dwarf Aging table, with appropriate
modification to temperature based on the neutron star’s
mass. If computing luminosity, a diameter value of
0.000015 corresponds to about 20.87 kilometres.

BLACK HOLES


A black hole occurs when a massive star explodes
in a supernova and its core retains enough mass
to continue to contract until its gravity becomes so
extreme that light cannot escape. The barrier where
this occurs is referred to as the event horizon and is
considered the surface of a black hole.

BLACK HOLE CHARACTERISTICS


Black holes have no theoretical maximum mass,
although most heavier than 100 are likely to have
formed through mergers or other methods, not stellar
collapse. To determine a black hole’s mass:

**_Black Hole Mass (_** ʘ **_) =_** 2.1 + 1D† - 1 +

†For a 6 and each additional 1D roll of 6, continue to
add 1D to mass.

Black holes smaller than 2.17 may exist but would
have formed through some process other than stellar
evolution; they may be primordial or artificially created.
Primordial black holes with a mass of less than 200
million tons will likely have already evaporated through
a process known as Hawking radiation.

Black hole diameter is directly related to mass:

**_Black Hole Diameter =_** 5.9km x Mass (ʘ)

A black hole by definition does not radiate heat. The
accretion disk around it, if any, may generate a great
deal of electromagnetic radiation but as with neutron
stars temperature is the smallest worry in such a
potentially dangerous environment. The Referee is
free to set whatever luminosity value is required for the
situation, ranging from zero to a torrent of light from the
shredded remains of giant stars.

DEAD STAR SYSTEM CHARACTERISTICS


A dead star generally disrupts its system and the
local environment during the process of dying. This
affects both travel into the system and what remains
after the star’s death.

JUMP RESTRICTIONS


If a system hosts no ‘normal’ stars, the Empty Hex Jump
DMs table affects jumps to these systems. If the dead
star is a member of a star system that contains normal

special circumstances

hydrogen-burning stars, no such restrictions apply.
However, pulsars and black holes cast unusual jump
shadows, the former because of its high spin rate and a
relativistic phenomenon known as frame dragging, the
latter because of its central singularity. All Astrogation
and Engineer (j-drive) checks to and from any systems
containing a pulsar or black hole suffer DM-4.

**PLANETARY SYSTEM**
Planetary systems around dead stars can be of two
different origins. They could be survivors of a star’s
earlier life, far enough away from the star to avoid being
consumed during the star’s giant phase or vaporized in
a supernova explosion, or they could be worlds formed
in the aftermath of the star’s death, accreted from the
remains of a previous generation of planets pulverised
as the star expanded and died. In either case, these
worlds exist and at least around white dwarfs, could
host familiar forms of life.

Most dead stars do not have a planetary system. The
death throes of a star either burn up planets or the
star’s mass loss from the end of its giant phase loosens
the bonds of gravity, causing worlds to spiral outward,
possibly interacting with other objects to become expelled
from the planetary system. To check for a planetary
system when the primary star is a dead star roll 2D:

**_Dead Star Planetary System Exists on 8+:_** 2D + DMs

Multiple ‘dead star’ system DM-2
Neutron star (or pulsar, magnetar) present DM-2
Black hole present DM-4

Regardless of DMs, a planetary system always exists
on a roll of natural 12. If a planetary system exists, the
following modifications apply to system:
•	 The check to see if a gas giant is absent is 6+
instead of the standard 10+. Alternatively, a gas
giant is only present on a roll of 9+. The roll to
determine the number of gas giants has post-stellar object DMs.
•	 The check to see if a planetoid belt is present is 6+
instead of the standard 8+. The roll to determine the
number of planetoid belts has post-stellar object DMs.

•	 The check to determine the number of terrestrial
planets is 1D-2 instead of the standard 2D-2.
•	 The minimum available Orbit# (MAO) around a
dead star is 0.001.
•	 All planets in orbit around a pulsar or magnetar
have the radioactive taint or irritant at severity and
persistence 9 in addition to any other taints or irritants.

NEBULAE


The term nebula is a broad characterisation of a
diffuse interstellar cloud composed of gases, ions and/
or dust. A nebula may be associated with star birth
or death. Protostar systems are often enshrouded in
nebulae or have partially burned them away, creating
glowing wisps and tendrils of ionized gas. A giant star
of moderate size ends its life by expelling layers of gas,
creating a short-lived planetary nebula as it settles into
slow decline as a white dwarf. Larger stars explode in
supernova, often lighting up previously expelled gas
or casting off new layers as they collapse into neutron
stars or black holes. Vast stretches of space may be
filled with dark clouds of dust, waiting for compression
or some other disturbance to set them on their way to
star creation or for some nearby bright star to slowly
evaporate them into nothingness. One thing all nebulae
have in common is their relative density; although they
appear solid or at least translucent to the eye, they are
mostly vacuum with the volume of a planet containing
only a few kilograms of diffuse material. Only their vast
size makes them appear solid.

For Traveller purposes, nebulae can occur in two ways:
they could be the result of a system generation roll or
may be a structure placed on a map by the Referee.
The former is generally a parsec or less in size and
may hold some unknown objects within its borders, the
latter is subject to the whims of the Referee and could
span whole sectors.

RANDOM NEBULA GENERATION


A Referee assigning random characteristics to a nebula
can use the Random Nebula Type table as a guide.

A planetary nebula should have an associated white
dwarf. Planetary nebulae do not last more than a few
thousand or tens of thousands of years before fading.

Random Nebula Type

1D Type Comments
1 Planetary nebula Roll 1D: on a 1 it is a single hex with a new white dwarf, on 2–6 a ring of six
hexes surrounding a young white dwarf.
2 Dark nebula Hex of cold dark gas and dust.
3–4 Ionised hydrogen nebula Hex of glowing gas ionised by nearby star formation.
5–6 Supernova remnant Hex of diffuse plasma generated by supernova debris.

special circumstances



The central white dwarf uses the 0.000 column on the
White Dwarf Aging table on page 227 to determine
initial temperature and luminosity. The Referee can
adjust a subsector or sector map to create a ring of
nebula around the central star or declare the nebula to
be a single hex with a white dwarf at the centre.

A dark nebula is opaque to visual light but infrared light
can pass through it. It may span multiple hexes at the
Referee’s discretion.

An ionised hydrogen nebula or H II Nebula is generally
associated with star formation. Examples of these
nebulae include the Orion Nebula and Eagle Nebula.
These nebulae may span large regions and are usually
ionised by a nearby supergiant star or star cluster. A
Referee may choose to place such nebulae near these
bright stars or add a bright star to an otherwise empty
hex adjacent to such a nebula.

A supernova remnant is the wispy remains of matter
expelled by a dying star. Depending on the age of the
remnant, it can be quite large. Such remnants may be
placed similarly to a planetary nebula or might span
whole subsectors as a full or broken ring. The centre of
this ring may contain a neutron star, a black hole or the
remnant object could have been ejected by an uneven
explosion, leaving a missing or off-centre object.

If the Referee wishes to randomly expand the size of
any nebula other than a planetary nebula, assign a
probability such as 1 in 6 to surrounding hexes and add

a hex of the nebula to any hex with a positive result.
Continuing this process around each new hex can
create a random multi-hex nebula. Certain directions
from the nebular hex can be granted additional modifiers
to simulate directionality in the nebula’s expanse, or
the Referee may decide, especially in the case of a
supernova remanent, to draw a circle around the central
remnant and assign a probability of nebula existence to
each hex in that circle.

OBJECTS WITHIN A NEBULA


A one hex nebula can contain any of the objects possible
to find in an empty hex as indicated on the Empty Hex
Objects table on page 221, with two differences:

First, any nebula except a planetary nebula may contain
protostars in early formation. Replace the white dwarf
row on the table with the following protostar entry:

Protostar 6 on 1D, then equal to
system density

3 Automatic

Second, multiply the table’s detection column value by
four for all smaller objects.

A multi-hex nebula may engulf incidental systems.
The Referee may choose to roll normally for system
occurrence and generation for such hexes. The
system in question is ‘just passing through’ the region
of nebula and while views of the night sky will be

special circumstances

affected, the sparse nature of most nebulae are such
that little additional effects occur, although the Referee
could decide that an especially dark nebula lowers the
temperature of worlds by 1D degrees as an inherent
temperature modification. Jump restrictions apply to
these incidental nebula occupants.

**JUMP RESTRICTIONS**
Jumps into or across nebulae are difficult. Despite the
low density, they create an overall diffused and lumpy
gravitational environment. All jump checks for Astrogation
and Engineer (j-drive), including the second Astrogation
check, receive a DM-1D. This DM is rolled once and
applied to all checks for that particular jump and applies
both when the destination is inside the nebula or if the
jump crosses or exits the hex containing the nebula. The
DM varies over time,and a ship experiencing a DM-1 for a
jump on one day may experience a DM-6 on exactly the
same jump at a later date or when returning across the
same path. Ships jumping from the same source to the
same destination in a 24-hour period will experience the
same DM but they cannot communicate the severity of
the penalty to one another.

STAR CLUSTERS


A star cluster is a dense conglomeration of stars. These
may be open star clusters resulting from recent star
formation, with all the stars in a tight grouping recently
born out of the same nebula, or they may be older
globular clusters bound by gravity for billions of years.
In either case, a general characteristic of a star cluster
is that the stars within the cluster tend to have the same
age. One or more interlopers may have wandered into
the cluster through random motion but for all systems (except one if the Referee places an interloper) in any
given hex, they will be identical in age.

For settings in the galactic spiral arms, star clusters are
almost always open star clusters. If a Referee wishes to
limit the cluster to a single hex, it may have 2D+5 star
systems associated with it. If a cluster is larger than
a single hex, it should be generally circular in shape,
1D+1 hexes across, with each hex from the centre
having an additional DM-2 to the roll for number of star
systems. The age of these open clusters is normally
less than one billion years. The Referee may determine
the age as 1D × 1D × 50 million years. If the cluster
is less than 200 million years old, a DM+1 applies to
the Star Type Determination table on page 15 but treat
results of 2 as unusual. If the unusual column indicates
another star cluster, treat it as a BD (brown dwarf)
result instead. A Referee can also choose to treat
anomaly results as brown dwarfs.

GENERATING CLUSTER SYSTEMS


As noted above, all systems in a star cluster have
the same age. If a massive star should have aged
out of the main sequence by the age of the cluster it
is instead considered a merged star created by the
collision of two less massive stars. The planetary
system of any merged star should have a DM-2 to
all rolls for the existence and quantity of planets (this
would technically be a DM+2 for the default method
of determining gas giant presence) and all orbits will
have DM+2 on the eccentricity table.

For each hex within a cluster (except the hex rolled
as the cluster hex, if it was a random consequence
of star determination) there is a chance equal to
the normal stellar density probability of a regular
system appearing – in other words, if it ‘spills’ into a
mapped region the existing systems can still exist,
surrounded by cluster stars.

JUMP RESTRICTIONS


Jumping into a dense star cluster poses challenges.
Unless the jump is to a directly adjacent star within the
cluster (Referee’s discretion) or from the outside to a
star on the outer edge of the cluster, all jumps suffer
a DM-1D to all Astrogation and Engineer (j-drive)
checks. Like the nebula modifier above, this DM
changes on a daily basis.

ARTIFICIAL WORLDS


Artificial structures in space range in size from single
module space stations to Dyson spheres. The former
is possible at TL6, the latter at perhaps TL29. For the
simplest of these structures and across their evolution
into larger highports and habitats, the existing paradigm
of Size 0 is a workable descriptive world format, covering
everything from the smallest station to habitats carved
out of asteroids. For truly world-sized or larger structures
a Referee can use a Size code of X to describe the
objects at very high Tech Levels. The objects in the
Artificial World Types table are representative of what
exists and what may be possible. Some, such as tent
worlds, ring moons and tiered worlds have as their basis
a naturally created planet and use the host world’s Size
code. Others, such as orbitals, ringworlds and Dyson
spheres are entirely constructed.

Objects from full-sized orbitals and larger have surface
areas that are greater than a full-sized planet. Many
variations of these object are possible. A Dyson sphere,
or a large set of independently orbiting stations utilising
most of the energy of the system’s central star could

special circumstances



be possible as early as TL8, given enough industrial
capacity and time to completely mine and transform an
asteroid belt or disassemble a small planet or moon.

IISS PROCEDURAL


Systems or objects that do not show up on
commercial maps are the subject of many of the
exploration office’s expeditions, some of which
take place in long settled sectors. An ‘empty hex’
that is home to a brown or a white dwarf may
have marginally habitable planets. In other empty
locations, rogue worlds can act as refuelling points or
convenient gravity wells on journeys otherwise too far
or dangerous to cross in a single jump.

Expeditions to these publicly uncharted locations
begin with remote observation, often over the course
of months. Ships jumping to locations with uncertain
refuelling prospects usually carry enough fuel to
ensure a return jump if wilderness refuelling proves
impossible. In some instances when one ship cannot
carry enough fuel for the return jump, a pair of ships will
jump with enough return fuel for one of them, allowing
the crews to consolidate onto a single ship and return
without becoming stranded. Drop tanks and external
fuel bladders wrapped in jump nets are also options

to extend the range of vehicles beyond their rated
maximum, especially when crossing rift areas.

The communications office is often involved in
provisioning and operating deep space jump bridges,
whether fully staffed stations or mere fuel dumps.
These ‘shortcuts’ can provide expedited passage
around small rifts to isolated worlds, enabling data and
package delivery to systems that would otherwise be
considerably delayed or not possible by normal means.
Such bridge stations rarely have commercial service, a
major reason for their absence on the RPSC charts.

Protostar systems are rare and almost always
interdicted by the IISS for safety reasons. This
interdiction is not enforced but those who violate Red
Zone restrictions should not expect rescue and if by
happenstance a scout crew encounters a stranded
ship, the recovered crew from the stricken vessel can
expect fines at best and at worst the confiscation of a
salvagable ship and any goods carried. Primordial star
systems are more common, accounting for several
stars in every sector. Some of these are home to belter
communities but most are too hazardous for settlement.
The Scout Service may place a base on a protected or

special circumstances distant planetesimal in such systems.

Neutron stars and black holes are rare. Most known
exemplars of such objects in Charted Space are either
in a star system with at least one ‘regular’ star and may
be distant enough for a civilisation to thrive in a far
corner of the system. The exploration or survey office
may place a base in such systems or visit with survey
or larger science vessels. The IISS posts an exclusion
zone to mark the closest safe approach to these
objects but as with protostar systems, the penalties
for violation are more the risks of the endeavour and
not any active enforcement. Pulsar and magnetar
systems, the latter absent from Charted Space, are too
hazardous to approach and are Red Zoned by default.
As for the known quiescent neutron stars and black
holes in ‘empty’ hexes, these are not listed on RPSC
charts unless they lie on a direct path between two
systems and pose a direct hazard to jump travel. The
space within an empty hex is vast and the odds of this
occurring are negligible.

Large artificial structures exist in Charted Space.
Lower tech objects such as massive space habitats
are common. More unusually artefacts, such as a small
ring moon, exists at Hliyh in the Trojan Reach and

Antra in Deneb has its Worldroof, as do many smaller
‘tented’ Selenite worlds in the Solomani Confederation.
Kaskii in Core is a tiered world.

The Ancients attempted to create greater wonders such
as the rosette of seven worlds at Tireen in Knaeleng, the
half-competed ringworld at Leenitakot in the Hinterworlds
and the rumoured Dyson sphere on the far side of Hiver
space. Whether the exploration branch has discovered
other such wonders is not public knowledge, although
rumours of these finds are as old as starflight. As such
massive artefacts would be interdicted, the Scout
Service is not inclined to publicise any such finds.

TOOLS


Survey scouts carry a large variety of specialised
equipment. The examples below are among those less
commonly available as surplus or civilian models.

PLANETOLOGY SENSOR PACK


This backpack is equipped with a suite of instruments
intended to analyse the characteristics of a planetary
environment, providing a full workup of atmosphere
and surface composition, climatic conditions and
rough internal planetary structure. The set includes
an atmospheric sensor with an advanced chemical
sniffer capable of identifying trace gases, organic
compounds and other airborne contaminants, a wide-angle PRIS EM-spectrum detector, a densitometer and
high-bandwidth interfaces to a DD/R display or neural
comm. It provides a DM+2 to any Science (planetology,
life sciences or chemistry) checks in addition to any
bonuses from a relevant science toolkit.

ENVIRONMENT SPIKE


An environment spike, sometimes called a survey
stick, is a miniaturised sensor array the size of a fist
atop a metre-long pole. The pole ends in a retractable
tripod of sharpened crystaliron legs. When placed on
the ground, an operator can release the legs, which
telescope into place with enough force to penetrate
rock, enabling a sturdy perch for the sensors. A 500
kilometre range transceiver allows multidirectional
transmission able to be detected by orbiting craft. The
sensor array includes a miniature weather station,
atmospheric sensor, broad spectrum auditory sensor
and fisheye-lens light-intensifier/thermal-image camera
to measure local conditions. Onboard data storage will
maintain one week of continuous sensor readings, full
audio and video, and up to two years of 15-minute data

# E QUIPMENT

reads and sample audio/video captures. The spike’s
surface is covered in solar cells and the weather
station’s wind sensors can be used to generate minimal
power to recharge onboard batteries that will last for
years in a standard atmosphere environment. Without
sunlight or atmosphere, the spike’s batteries allow
six months of operation if limited to data bursts of
15-minute samples. If used as a weapon, the spiked
legs have AP 6 and cause 2D damage, penetrating up
to 10 centimetres into the target.

Environment spikes are weighted and configured to
land upright and deploy into the ground if dropped from
a moving vehicle or can be hand-placed by landing
parties. A switch on the side of the pole retracts the
barbed tips of the spike legs for easy retrieval.

VEHICLES


The IISS uses a variety of vehicles in field operations, ranging from g-carrier-sized survey vehicles to grav
belts. The procurement branch has made a major effort to standardise on a few basic models of vehicles,
allowing interoperability and ease of maintenance and training. The survey pod line of vehicles is an attempt to
build flexibility into a single frame of small vehicles. First introduced in the latter years of the Second Survey,
adoption of pod variants has been slow, hampered by a surprisingly conservative attitude within the field
offices to accept something new.

IISS SURVEY POD



A survey pod is a pressurised spherical grav vehicle
designed for up to two people surveying a large area.
It is not equipped with an airlock and requires complete
depressurisation to exit in the field but the rear iris
valve will mate to the exterior of a standard airlock.
Fast and long range, it is not spacious but enables two
explorers and 250 kilograms of equipment to cover
a vast surface area, potentially circumnavigating a
Size 6 or smaller world without refuelling. Two survey
pods often replace a single air/raft in a scout/courier
or survey vessel, allowing teams to cover a broader
area. The survey pod is protected against vacuum and
exotic atmospheres but was not designed to withstand
extreme temperatures or other dangerous local
environmental conditions. The forward hemispherical
hull is entirely transparent, giving the driver and
passenger a wide field of view but the vehicle is
not armoured, making it vulnerable to damage from
meteoritic activity or hostile natives.

The survey pod’s life support system can sustain its
occupants for up to 90 days and will support a third
occupant if seated in the storage area behind the side-by-side forward seats. It is capable of reaching orbit and
descending safely to the surface of a world, making it an
excellent lifeboat in emergency circumstances.

IISS COVERT OPERATIONS POD



The covert operations pod or COP is a modified
survey pod developed for use in hostile environments.
It has superior protection from both environmental
and sophont-initiated hazards. Heavily armoured and
covered in active multi-chromatic camouflage and
stealth materials, the pod has little room for equipment
beyond its two occupants. The cramped interior
requires tandem seating, with the rear seat folding into
the floor to give access to the forward driver’s seat.
Often, only a single operator flies the pod and carries
equipment in the area cleared by the folded seat. From
the interior, the forward half appears transparent but
this is from the holographic image repeaters coating
the interior walls, fed by hundreds of camera sensors
embedded in the armoured hull.

The COP’s frame is identical to the survey pod’s
hull dimensions allowing the two pods to be used
interchangeably. Able to withstand high pressures
and temperatures and insidious atmospheres, it is
often preferred over the survey pod because of this
operational flexibility but its high cost and limited
internal volume makes it considerably more difficult to
requisition. As with the survey pod, it has long-term life
support capability but can only act as a lifeboat for two
adult human-size occupants.

ROBOTS


The scout service’s field offices pride themselves on their independent spirit and endurance in difficult
environments but at times the environment is either too hazardous or the staff too thinly stretched to accomplish the
mission. At these times, survey and exploration teams can employ a variety of robots to help them complete their
tasks. These tireless servants receive none of the acclaim for their discoveries and much distain from their users
but without them many missions would not achieve success.

SURVEY HELPER


A survey helper looks like a flying drum with two arms
and 20 eyes scattered atop its rounded head. Designed
to accompany survey teams as an extra pair of hands (and many pairs of eyes), the survey helper can act as
a field investigator and data acquirer in conjunction with
a survey team, or can operate alone in environments
too hazardous to sophont life. Although unarmoured,
it can withstand high radiation and insidious
environments and report back to a ship in orbit or a
team awaiting data in a safe location.

**MICROSPY**
The microspy is a covert surveillance tool
designed to be invisible, inaudible and
undetectable by smell. It is a disk three
millimetres in diameter that can hover for
four days or lay dormant for months. While
able to perform standard survey duties, it
is very expensive for its size and is usually
deployed to closely survey potentially
hostile or sociologically fragile sophonts.

**REMOTE ENVIRONMENT SENTINEL**
The remote environment sentinel or RES is a
smart version of an environment spike, with greatly
improved sensors and a rather basic brain. A major
innovation is the addition of a gecko gripper surface,
allowing it to be placed on vertical or fragile surfaces.
Capable of functioning for more than 10 weeks in
the dark and able to recharge batteries in even
dim lighting, it can operate indefinitely, collecting
information about its surroundings and storing it for
years or passing it on to an orbital satellite.

POD DROID


The pod droid is a robot in the body of a IISS
covert survey pod. Designed to operate in
environments too hazardous for crews, this
totally autonomous robot with a self-aware
brain is still experimental. It is highly skilled
in all relevant sciences and will often remind
its human compatriots of its competence.
Two retractable human-sized arms allow
the pod to interact with its environment and
a hazardous material storage compartment
permits it transport samples back to its
mothership. The survey office considers
this robot ‘too smart’ for its duties and has
requisitioned a version with a less advanced
brain for cost-containment reasons.

SOFTWARE



**CENSUS ESTIMATOR**
Initially developed for the First Survey, but still in use
in modified form, is the census estimator, a limited
artificially intelligent software package adept at
identifying patterns from patchy multi-dimensional data
and creating a highly accurate summary scoring a
world’s population, culture and economy. The census
estimator can complete the Class IV Part C survey
form with just two days of person (or machine) input
per Population code of a world with a high
degree of accuracy. After two days times the
world’s Population code, the census estimator
completes its task with a Routine (6+) check
with no modifiers. On a failure, the check can
be repeated after a number of days equal to the
world’s Population code.

Software Bandwidth TL Cost
Census Estimator 3 13 Cr10000

SYSTEM SURVEYOR


This software package performs the basic task of
surveying a star system, using whatever sensors are
available and data from any deployed probe. A system
surveyor package can complete a Class II Survey
without operator guidance after one week of information
gathering with an Average Electronics (sensors) check
using the DMs for a ship’s sensors and its Bandwidth
-2. Use of at least two probe drones provides DM+1,
or DM+2 if they are advanced probe drones. A failed
check allows a second attempt after a number of days
equal to the negative Effect.

**DEEP SPACE SURVEYOR**
This software package integrates with sensors
to detect distant objects in ‘empty’ hexes.
When operating on a ship or station with
sensors of at least military grade (DM+0)
acuity, the deep space surveyor can control
scans and analyse data to search for the faint
signatures of interstellar objects. Intended to
operate autonomously, this limited intellect
package provides a DM+1 on both detection
points (see page 221) gathered and the
Electronics (sensors) check to identify these
objects. The improved version of this software
grants DM+2 to both instead.


HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENT


EXPLORATION BOAT



The IISS has spent centuries attempting to
standardise on just a few basic ship types but
niche needs require niche craft. These include
the hazard environment exploration boat and
the surveyor cutter module. Both craft were
developed for use during the Second Survey. Very
few of the specialised boats exist and a requisition
for a pair can often require a year or more of lead
time but the cutter modules are plentiful, many
mothballed after the completion of the Second
Survey or repurposed as additional living quarters
adjacent to scout bases.

Designed to penetrate the most hostile environments,
the hazardous exploration environment boat (HEEB),
is a blunt 24-ton craft designed to fit two to a cutter
bay. The boat’s hull is protected against extremes
of pressure, radiation and heat, making it ideal for
exploration of the most challenging environment,
including the depths of hot gas giants and brown
dwarf atmospheres. These vehicles are only
assigned to expeditions dedicated to studying such
extreme environments, a pair substituting for one
cutter. Standard operating procedure has one boat
performing deep exploration with a second boat
operating in a more benign environment and standing
by as a rescue vessel as necessary.

Accretion Disk: A broad ring-like structure formed
by diffuse material in orbital motion around a massive
central body, such as a black hole, star or protoplanet.
Albedo: The fraction of solar energy a world reflects
back into space. For temperature determination, the
Bond albedo, which covers all wavelengths of radiation
reflected, is used.
Asteroid Belt: A planetoid belt which is the mainworld
of a system.
Astronomical Unit: See AU.
AU: Astronomical Unit. A unit of measure in star
systems. Equal to the average distance (semi-major
axis) between Sol and Terra, approximately 150 million
kilometres or exactly 149,597,870.9 kilometres.
Bar: A unit of used for describing atmospheric pressure
equal to 100,000 Pascals. Terra’s sea level (mean
baseline altitude) pressure is 1.013 bar.
Circumbinary: An orbit that circles around two stars.
Circumtrinary: An orbit around three stars.
Dwarf Planet: A small terrestrial body in independent
orbit around one or more stars (not a moon). All Size
S planets are dwarf planets. Size 1 planets within
asteroid or planetoid belts are generally considered
dwarf planets.
Eccentricity: A measure of the deviation of an orbit from
circular. With a value from 0 to near 1, an eccentric orbit
around a primary body varies from its average value by a
factor of (1 - eccentricity) to (1 + eccentricity).
Gas Dwarf: A terrestrial world (Size F or smaller)
with an atmosphere code of H, indicating a thick
atmosphere predominately composed of hydrogen. A
gas dwarf is less than twice the diameter of Terra and
less than 10 [[Terra|Terran]] masses.
Gas Giant: A massive world whose atmosphere is
mostly hydrogen and whose surface is unreachable
by most technology. Generally, a planet of at least 10
[[Terra|Terran]] masses and at least twice the diameter of Terra.
GWP: Gross world product. The total value of the
output of a world’s economy in a standard year. The
‘per capita GWP’ measures the GWP divided by the
total population of a world.

Gyr: Giga-year. Short for one billion years. The
plural is ‘Gyrs’.
HZCO: Habitable Zone Centre Orbit#. The ideal orbital
location around a star or group of stars for habitability,
based on the orbital position of Terra around Sol at
Orbit# 3.0 or 1AU.
IISS: Imperial Interstellar Scout Service. The
exploration, survey and communications service of the
Third Imperium.
Kelvin: An absolute temperature scale. The
temperature 0K is absolute zero. Celsius temperatures
are equal to their Kelvin value minus 273.15, usually
rounded to -273.
LaGrange Points: Also known as the L1, L2, L3,
L4 and L5 points. Locations of gravitational stability
between two objects. L1 is the point of balance
between the two objects, L2 is beyond the orbit of the
lower massed object and L3 is on the far side (180°)
of the smaller mass’s orbit around the larger body.
L4, sometimes called the leading trojan point, is in the
same orbit as the smaller body but 60° ahead of it. L5,
or the trailing trojan point, is 60° behind it. Only L4 and
L5 orbits are stable over long periods.
Luminosity: The total or ‘bolometric’ brightness (energy output) of a star, expressed in values relative
to Sol (1.0).
Main Sequence Star: Most stars during the majority of
their lifespans. Also known as ‘Class V’ or ‘dwarf’ stars.
Mainworld: The most important world in a system.
This is the world detailed in the system’s UWP
characteristics. This world is usually the most populous
but does not necessarily need to be a planet; it could
be a moon or even an artificial habitat.
Mean Baseline Altitude: The altitude defined as a
world’s ‘zero’ or base altitude. For ocean-dominated
worlds, this is normally the mean sea level. For other
worlds, it may be the world’s terrain average altitude or
some other agreed-upon level.
Mean Temperature: A default temperature value for a
world. This temperature corresponds to the year-long
average temperature of a region of 45° latitude at the
world’s mean baseline altitude.

# G LOSSARY

Minimum Allowable Orbit#: The closest a world can
orbit a star or number of stars. Abbreviated as MAO.

Orbit#: The term Orbit# refers to the value of a planet
or planetoid belt’s orbital location as listed in the Orbit#
table on page 26.

PD: See planetary diameter.

PGL: An abbreviation for Population, Government and
Law Level. PGL is shorthand for the social description
portion of the Universal World Profile.

Planetary Diameter: A measurement distance equal to
the diameter of the planet; used to determine distance
of a moon from its planet. Abbreviated as PD.

Planetoid Belt: A region of multiple small objects in
orbit around a star. Any belt of asteroids that is not the
mainworld is referred to as a planetoid belt.

Prograde: A rotation or revolution of a body in line with
most other bodies in the system, generally defined as
‘right-handed’ or counter-clockwise.

Retrograde: A rotation or revolution of a body opposite
that of most bodies in the system, generally defined as
‘left-handed’ or clockwise.

Roche Limit: The limit inside of which an orbiting
body will be torn apart by tidal forces of its parent
body. Within this limit only rings or very small bodies
can exist; beyond this limit, solid objects such as
moons in orbit around planets or planets in orbit
around a star can exist.

RPSC: Reference public star chart. An IISS-produced
and maintained public database freely available from
every scout base, containing Second Survey or more
recent information for all Charted Space sectors within
four sectors or 160 parsecs of Reference and for many
regions up to 200 parsecs from Reference.

RSC: Reference star chart. An IISS-produced and
maintained database containing all but redacted or highly
restricted survey data available to the Scout Service.
Generally, only accessible by active duty scout personnel
or detached duty scouts issued a scout/courier.

RU: Resource unit. A measure of a system’s net
contribution to the economy of a larger interstellar state.

SAH: An abbreviation for Size, Atmosphere and
Hydrographics. SAH is shorthand for the physical
description portion of the Universal World Profile.

Scale Height: The rate at which an atmosphere
decreases in pressure. By definition this value is the
height above mean baseline altitude required for the
atmospheric pressure to be reduced by a factor of e
or 2.718.

Semi-Major Axis: The average orbital distance of a
body around its primary, measured centre to centre.
Sidereal Day: The amount of time required for an
object to rotate once on its axis. Contrast to solar day.
Significant Body: Any world that is the focus of the
system generation process. Generally, this is a natural
object of at least 400 kilometres diameter (Size S or
larger). Depending on its location in the system it may
also be called a significant planet or moon, or more
generically ‘body’ or ‘world’.
Solar Day: The amount of time required for a planet
to rotate to the point where its parent star is in the
same location in the sky – the time between two solar
‘noons’. Contrast to sidereal day.
Star Class: The luminosity (brightness) class of a star,
(Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, V, VI) ranging from brightest to dimmest.
Star Type: The spectral type of a star with an
alphabetic value (O, B, A, F, G, K, M) followed by
a numeric subtype (0–9). These values range from
the hottest and generally most massive (O0) to the
dimmest and generally least massive (M9).
Terrestrial Planet (or World): Any world that is not a
gas giant or planetoid belt and has a Size 1–F (15).
Terragens: Terragens are lifeforms whose ancestors
originated on Terra. In a generic sense, this includes all
humans and species from Terra. In Charted Space, it
includes Vargr, Dolphins, Apes and any other uplifted or
genetically modified lifeforms from [[Terra|Terran]] stock.
Trojan World: A co-orbiting planet or moon, orbiting
60 degrees before or behind another world in the same
orbit. The world may either be leading (L4) or trailing (L5) the larger world in the same orbit.
Twilight Zone World: A world tidally locked to its
primary star(s) so that one side is in perpetual daylight,
another in perpetual night, with a narrow twilight zone
in between.
UWP: Universal World Profile. The alphanumeric string
that describes a world. Composed of the starport class,
SAH, PGL and Tech Level.
World: Any object, natural or otherwise that is the focus
of the system generation process. The mainworld can
be a world, even if it is an artificial object but in general
a world is an object with a UWP, usually a planet,
significant moon or planetoid belt.

QUICK SURVEY GUIDE FOR



EXPLORATION ADVENTURES


A sane Referee is unlikely to take the time to fully
develop dozens or hundreds of systems for an
adventure or campaign focused on exploring unknown
or partially charted systems. Using just a few dice rolls,
unknown systems can be categorised on a Class 0
Survey form with little preparation. Assuming system
locations have been placed on a subsector or larger
map – consider this ‘Step 0’ – then enough information
for a rough Class 0 survey can proceed using just the
‘meaty’ part of the Class 0 form:

The first three steps can be done in one Yahtzee-like
toss, using two identical dice for step one and five
differently coloured dice for steps 2 and 3.

Step 1: Primary star: For each hex with a system,
roll 2D on the Star Type Determination table (page
15) and record the primary star’s type and class –
subtype is not necessary.

Step 2: Other stars: Use a modified version of the
Multiple Stars Presence table (page 23). A roll of 10+
on 2D is equivalent to a roll of 6 on 1D. Therefore, roll
four dice (of different colours): Every 6 is another star
in the Close, Near, Far or companion (of the primary)
slot. For primary stars with a DM-1 for multiple stars,
ignore every other roll of 6 – picking the one that falls
closest and furthest from the Referee or any other
method that varies the result – for stars with a DM+1.
Count every other 5 as a 6 by some similar method.

Step 3: Gas giants: Roll 1D and on a 1 there is no
gas giant present in the system.

Step 4: If any Close, Near or Far stars are present,
roll 1D for each, assigning a companion on a roll of 6.

Location Primary + Close + Near + Far + GG? Notes

Step 5: Determine the types of other stars from the
Non-Primary Star Determination table (page 29).
Results of sibling can be provisional noted with a
-1D notation (or roll), going back to subtype stars
later, if necessary.

If the Travellers decide to jump to the star system, the
Referee can take further measures to complete the
Class I survey by:
•	 Subtyping the stars (d10 or Star Subtype table,
page 16)
•	 Determine system age (section begins on page
20 – for anything dimmer than G6 use the small
star age)

While in jump transit, the Referee can prep a Class
II survey:
•	 Assign Orbit#s to stars (multiple star systems only

- use the Stellar Orbit# Ranges table on page 27)
•	 Determine world types and quantities (page
36 – remember, gas giant existence is already
checked)

If the adventure does not call for a survey of the
system, the only worlds that likely matter are gas
giants – for refuelling, and any habitable zone worlds.
In this case:
•	 Determine the HZCO for the star(s) from the
Habitable Zone Centre Orbit#s (HZCO) table (page 41)
•	 Determine the baseline number from placement
of worlds. If it is between 1 and the system’s total
worlds, randomly assign a world to that location.
•	 Determine basic world sizing (page 54) for that
world and SAH or moon info if appropriate. If
the baseline number calls for a compact (or
hot) or sparce ( or cold) system, determine how
much effort is necessary for the session or use
it to ‘fake it’.
•	 Determine a Spread value for the system.
•	 Place and roughly size any gas giants to aid a
wilderness refuelling operation.
•	 Make do with an appropriate level of effort,
completely detailing a system only if necessary.

Traveller has existed since 1977 and its advanced
star system generation system appeared in 1983. As
mentioned in the introduction, the initial attempts in
Book 6: Scouts and the World Builder’s Handbook to
create whole star systems for Traveller were hampered
by a single data point: the solar system. By 2022, it is
clear that our solar system is not a typical star system.
It lacks any planets closely orbiting the central star or
any superearth-sized worlds, amongst other things.
Still, a full picture of a typical star system or even
accurate inventories of extrasolar planets are limited
by the tools currently available: mostly orbital doppler
effects and transits, both of which favour the detection
of closely orbiting and/or massive worlds. Those few
worlds directly imaged are mostly large young (and
therefore hot) super-jovian planets. These attempts to
create a model from current information will probably
look naïve or just plain wrong in a few decades time
when better information becomes available. To repeat
an adage: all models are wrong; some models are
useful. Hopefully these are useful.

Still, a goal of this effort has been to try to bridge
existing Traveller material and decades of accumulated
Traveller lore (much of which has a home on the wiki)
with what is currently known about star systems and
planets. To that end, this book keeps a modified form
of the Orbit# system, despite it being originally based
on the Titus-Bode relationship, a formula that has no
scientific basis and does not exactly work, even for
Neptune. The major modification to the Orbit# system
was to set the base of Orbit# 0 at 0.0AU, not 0.2AU as
in those previous versions and to focus on fractional
Orbit# values. This allows for the many tightly packed
systems such as TRAPPIST-1 (whose seventh known
planet is only 0.06AU from its star) to be modelled.
Retaining Orbit#s also has the advantage of providing
a simple method to continue to widen the gap between
planets in a way that keeps the ratio of their periods
more or less intact. It also works well enough for initially
determining distances between stars in a multi-star
system using the T5 Close, Near, Far star paradigm.
Adding fractional Orbit#s is something that has already
crept into other Traveller publications and its extensive
use here just expands upon it.

The principle (a generic statement which may turn out
to be incorrect) that planets are as densely packed as
possible led to the concept of spread, which allows

for both densely and sparsely packed systems while
still keeping some sort of period-based ratio – a very
modified Titus-Bode.

Rules for available Orbits# in multi-star systems are
simplified and based on these arbitrary Orbit#s, not
actual orbital mechanics. An initial attempt to model
this based on stellar mass, orbits and eccentricity was
quickly abandoned once I realised that I was trying to
solve a three (or more) body with spreadsheet math.
Astronomers and physicists may cringe at the result
but it is close enough for game use, and a Referee is
always free to move an offending Orbit# to another
location. Likewise, the true hierarchical view of a multi-star system with barycentres and such was abandoned
for a primary-centric Orbit# view. Again, good enough
for game use and a large number of calculations will in
most cases likely result in outcomes similar to the rules
of thumb presented here.

Temperatures, for all the complexity presented here
are much more complex than modelled in this book.
An often cited dozen-page paper on ‘simplified’
determination of temperature by latitude would have
resulted in a full page of explanation and calculation,
followed by frustration. The approximations in the book
at least provide plausible results.

Still, it is possible that I have made some fundamental
mistakes and that reviewers and editors will not catch
them. For that, I apologise in advance.

Finally, as mentioned in the introduction, this book
is intended as a guide, not a straitjacket. The rules
could allow a Referee to create a programmatic
method to generate star systems. I have done so
by other methods in the past and tested the results
of this book’s procedures in an overly complex yet
inadequate spreadsheet form and while that might be
suitable for an exploration campaign such as Deepnight
Revelation, it is not as suitable for the continuation
method, especially in an existing campaign. Worse,
it removes Referee creativity from the process. While
rules for determining the length of a year or the basic
temperature are physics-based, the Referee could and
should move worlds around, adjust greenhouse and
albedo values or change atmospheric gas mixes if that
is what makes a world match their vision.

The game belongs to the players, not the dice.
