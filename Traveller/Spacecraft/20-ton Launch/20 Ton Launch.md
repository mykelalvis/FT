# 20-Ton Launch

by Loren K. Wiseman 

The 20-ton launch is among the smallest general utility craft in common use, manufactured in many configurations throughout known  space.  This  publication  deals  with nine common variants (including an armed version normally called a gig to distinguish it from the others). The vehicle’s low price and simple construction make it a very popular basis  for  conversions  and  add-ons.  Modifications can be carried out at any starport.

Launches are normally used for trips of 12- 18 hours. Longer durations are possible, but most  do  not  make  provision  for  overnight trips.  On-board  life  support  is  good  for considerably  longer  than  that,  but  no provision is made for extra crew or the long- term comfort of the crew or passengers. 

The deck plans presented in this booklet are numbered rather than labeled, to allow referees to change the coding and show the plans  to  their  players  without  giving  away any  secrets  (such  as  the  locations  of  the emergency  exits),  and  to  make  such adjustments  as  their  individual  campaigns may require.

## Standard 20-ton Launch

![](20tonlaunch.png)
The standard variant of the launch can be used as a small craft on a larger vessel or on its own. Planetary entrepreneurs some- times  operate  them  as  local  transports, similar to intercity bus or railroad lines.  

The standard configuration incorporates a two-seat flight deck with positions for a pilot and a flight engineer, a fresher for use by the  crew  and  any  passengers,  an  airlock, standard avionics and control packages, fuel tanks,  a  combined  passenger/cargo  bay (with 6 tons of cargo space and spacious  accommodations for six passengers), and a maneuver drive rated for 2 Gs.  

The  engineering  section  is  not  normally manned while in flight – the flight engineer monitors its operation from the FE station in the cockpit. 

In  most  variants,  the  cockpit  and  engineering  sections  are  identical,  and  their descriptions are not repeated unless some- thing changes significantly. 

Emergency exit panels are located on the boat’s dorsal and ventral surfaces, every two meters – these are explained in more detail in the engineering section. 

### Cockpit

The cockpit consists of the area forward of the  airlock  and  fresher,  and  is  separated from the remainder of the vessel by a pressure tight sliding door which can be locked for security purposes.  There is an [[#emergency exit]] (`14`) here. 

#### Avionics

`1` - A standard avionics package is  fitted  to  all  models  (passive  and  active sensors, commo, and navigation systems). 

#### Pilot’s Station
`2` - The pilot occupies this station during flight. 

#### Flight  Engineer’s  Station
`3` - The  flight engineer  monitors  all  systems  from  this station during flight. 

#### Supply Locker
`4` - The two supply lockers, both port and starboard)  in  the  cockpit  contain  standard emergency gear, including tools and spares, two  rescue  balls,  and  basic  first  aid  and survival  supplies.  Crew  are  expected  to provide  their  own  [[Vacc Suit]]s (but  see [[#Engineering Section]])*. 

### Passenger/Cargo Section

The  passenger  section  and  cargo  sections  can  be  reconfigured  by  adding  or deleting passenger seating as need dictates (folding them into the floor or bringing them up) and moving the bulkhead accordingly. 

#### Airlock
`5` - The airlock can hold up to six normal-sized  humans  at  one  cycle  (albeit rather crammed in). 

#### Fresher
`6` - A standard fresher containing a shower, toilet, and washbasin (which folds into the wall above the toilet). 

#### Passenger Seating
`7` - Each seat incorporates a standard rescue ball for use by the occupant in an emergency. Seats are also adjustable (within limits) to accommodate a wide variety of human and non-human body types,  including  allowance  for  tails  and  a variety of dorsal protuberances.  There is an [[#emergency exit]] (`14`) here.

#### Cargo  Bay
`8` - Cargo  is  limited  to  that which can fit through the airlock and down the  corridor  between  seats,  unless  an optional  cargo  (non-airlock)  hatch  is  fitted leading  directly  into  the  cargo  section. Vessels with this fitting normally load while inside a larger bay or add an additional bulk- head  and  sliding  door  between  the  passenger and cargo compartments. There is an [[#Emergency Exit]] (`14`) here.

### Fuel Section

#### Fuel Tanks (P/S)
`9` - The boat’s fuel tanks are  conventional `Lhyd `tanks,  normally refilled through standard fittings on the part, starboard, dorsal, and ventral sides. Some variants of the 30-ton ship’s boat have a fuel skimmer installed at the expense of part of the passenger/cargo sections. 

#### Access Hallway
`10` - This passage connects  the  cargo  and  engineering  sections, and has pressure-tight doors at both ends. Both  of  these  doors  can  be  locked  for security purposes.  It generally has an [[#Emergency Exit]] (`14`).

### Engineering Section

Engineering  contains  standard  tools  and spares  for  the  life  support  and  drive machinery,  extra  air  tanks  and  a  OSFA (one-size-fits-all)  vacc  suit  for  emergency EVAs (in case none of the crews’ suits are functional), and two more rescue balls. 

#### Crew  Access
`11` - This  space  allows maintenance  access  to  life  support  machinery and maneuver drive monitoring instruments. It is used for in-flight monitoring and maintenance by the flight engineer.  

#### Life Support
`12` - Life support systems are automated, and require only periodic mon- itoring during normal operations. 

#### Maneuver  Drives
`13` - The  vessel’s maneuver drives are rated at 2 Gs. They are not normally accessed during flight, but are monitored  from  the  cockpit  at  the  pilot’s station. 

#### Emergency Exit
`14` - These are located at  intervals  on  the  dorsal  and  ventral  sur- faces. These are not airlocks, so they are for use  only  in  breathable  atmospheres,  or when  all  occupants  are  in  [[Vacc Suit]]s  or [[rescue ball]]s. Emergency exits have variable shapes  (some  are  square,  some  rectangular, circular or oval), but all are large enough  to  permit  a  rescue  ball  to  pass through  readily.  The  exits  are  (usually) clearly marked, and labeled with instructions and warnings in several languages. In some vessels,  the  emergency  exits  cannot  be opened  unless  an  activation  switch  in  the cockpit  is  thrown  (to  prevent  them  from being opened accidentally). 

In  some  cases,  the  emergency  exit  may not be readily discernable. The ones in the floor  of  the  passenger  compartment,  for example,  are  normally  concealed  under carpeting and are intended to be operated only by members of the crew. 


## 20-ton Lifeboat
![](20tonlifeboat.png)
Some  free  traders  and  merchantmen specializing in passenger service carry the 24-passenger lifeboat version of the launch at the expense of some cargo space.  

The  cockpit  and  engineering  sections  of the lifeboat are identical to those of the standard  configuration,  although  the  details  of the avionics systems and controls differ. 

Because of the possibility they may have to  travel  great  distances,  lifeboats  are normally  equipped  with  many  emergency [[low berth]]s, in order to cut down on life support  requirements  during  what  may  be  a long journey. The idea is for the crew to help the  passengers  into  the  low  berths,  set  a course for safety, and either pilot the lifeboat there  manually,  or  set  the  automatic  pilot and then enter the ELBs themselves (which can be set to awaken them shortly before arrival). In some cases, the crew may simply set the lifeboat in a stable orbit and enter the ELBs to await rescue. The computer can be programmed to broadcast distress warnings, monitor the low berths, and react to contact in a wide variety of ways. 

The [[#fuel section]] and [[#engineering section]]s of the lifeboat configuration are identical to those of the standard configuration. 

### Passenger/Cargo Section

The [[#passenger section]] of the lifeboat has been  heavily  modified.  ELBs  for  24 passengers, and cramped seating for up to four additional persons have been installed, allowing  the  craft  to  carry  28  passengers plus two flight crew.  The [[#airlock]] and [[#fresher]] are still present.

#### Cramped  Seats 
`7` - These  are  normally occupied  by  non-flight  crew  during  short flights.  During  long  duration  emergency flights, the crew occupy [[#Emergency Low Berths|ELBs]] as well. 
#### Emergency  Low  Berths
`8` - Emergency low berths (ELBs) are used on lifeboats because it is  not  feasible  for  a  small  craft  to  carry enough life support for an extended journey should  an  emergency  occur  in  an  un- inhabited system or in the outermost regions of an inhabited system. 

## 20-ton Liaison Launch
![](20tonliaisonlaunch.png)
This  version  of  the  launch  is  used  as  a long-distance  transport  for  military  officers, public officials, business magnates, etc. 

The cockpit, fuel, and engineering sections are identical to those of the standard configuration launch. 

### Passenger/Cargo Section

This section is equipped to serve as a mobile  office/headquarters,  with  communications equipment, a conference table and seats for four passengers.  

#### Passenger Seating
`7` - Four roomy passenger seats are installed, folding into the floor if necessary. A conference table can be stowed  during  transit,  and  erected  as needed.  Holographic  technology  allows  a wide variety of maps and other information to be displayed, in two or three dimensions as necessary. 

#### Cargo
`8` - Cargo consists of consumables and the passengers’ luggage. 

## 20-ton Survey Launch 

![](20tonsurveylaunch.png)
This variant is assigned to research  stations,  bases,  and  other  ships  and  installations  requiring  a  specialized  survey  and research craft. Specialized equipment varies with the individual mission and the type of information to be gathered. 

The cockpit, fuel and engineering sections are  identical  to  those  of  the  standard configuration. 

### Passenger/Cargo Section

The passenger section has been fitted with workstations  and  a  sensor  package  that varies with the overall mission of the vessel. 
#### Workstations
`7` - The  nature  of  the vessel’s workstations depends on the nature of the research required. 

## 20-ton S & R Launch 
![](20tonsearchandrescue.png)
The search and rescue version incorporates medical and rescue gear and carries a four-person rescue team in addition to the crew.  Floodlights  have  been  fitted  to  the  exterior  to  illuminate  the  scene  of  any rescue.  S&R  launches  are  assigned  to starports,  bases  (both  deep  space  and planetary),  and  anywhere  else  where  they  may be needed.
### Cockpit Section
Cockpit Section The main modification to the cockpit section is on the outside: a rescue hoist with a capacity of 250 kilograms has been fitted over the [[#airlock]], with controls both at the outer airlock door and in the cockpit at the [[#Flight Engineer’s Station]]. Sensor sweeps are managed from the [[#Flight Engineer’s Station]], and are focused on locating victims by finding crash sites, heat signatures, or distress beacons.
### Passenger/Cargo Section 

Four roomy passenger seats are retained for the search and rescue team assigned to the  vessel.  The  remaining  cargo  space  is taken  up  by  rescue  and  medical  supplies and  a  single  emergency  low  berth  for extreme casualties.  

Supplies  include  24  [[rescue  balls]],  [[vacc suits]] and [[grav belts]] for the rescue team, two grav  stretchers  for  recovery  of  injured (usable  in  vacuum  or  hazardous  atmospheres),  rope,  cable,  rescue  harnesses, food and water, blankets, portable heaters, plus first aid kits and other medical supplies. 

When the victims have been located, the rescue team deploys, equipped in keeping with the situation and environment. Victims are  assessed,  prioritized,  and  returned  to the vessel as rapidly as possible given con- ditions, where they will be given treatment to stabilize  their  condition  (or  put  into  the [[#Emergency Low Berths]]) and transported back to the base.  
#### Modified Passenger Seating
`7`a- An [[#emergency low berth]] has been installed at the expense of two of the four passenger seats. 

The [[#Cargo Bay]] is entirely taken up by survival,  rescue and medical supplies and equipment. 
## 20-ton Hunting Launch 

![](20tonhuntinglaunch.png)
Designed  for  use  with  safari  ships  and yachts,  this  variant  comes  equipped  with   gun  racks,  cargo  space  for  trophies,  and optional provision for hunting dogs or other animals.  

The cockpit, fuel and engineering sections identical  to  those  of  the  standard  are  identical  to  those  of  the  standard configuration.  configuration. 

**Cockpit Section  Passenger/Cargo Section** 

 **7. Passenger Seating:** Seats are provided for up to four passengers. 

#### Specific Cargo Modifications

This includes weapons racks and other hunting paraphernalia. Space may be allocated to carriers hunting dogs or similar lifeforms `8a`, and provision for trophy preservation and storage (for the return trip).
## 20-ton Retail Launch 
![](20tonretaillaunch.png)
This variant is fitted out as a traveling retail store,  and  is  used  in  sparsely  populated areas to carry goods to remote farms and small villages. This variant incorporates the optional  loading  leading  directly  into  the passenger cargo bay. 

The  merchandise  carried  varies,  but usually consists of items in high demand in backwater  areas  –  simple,  high  value/low bulk consumer goods, clothing, electronics, and so on. The vessel lands in a suitable location, and the entrepreneur sets up shop in a rental building or, in some cases, in a tent or portable shelter carried aboard the launch  or  (in  the  case  of  a  hostile  atmo- sphere)  inside  the  launch  itself.  When  the owner judges he has sold everything he can in an area, the “peddler” moves on. Often the same dealer will return at regular intervals, in the manner of the itinerant peddlers of frontier America, but with difference that radio communication allows him  to  accept special orders for particular goods, and to tailor his inventory to the needs of a specific region. 

The cockpit, fuel and engineering sections are  identical  to  those  of  the  standard configuration. 

### Passenger/Cargo Section

#### Passenger Seating Modifications
Passenger seating has been cut back to two, and the cargo bay expanded  accordingly.  During  retail  operations, the seats are folded into the floor and the  deck  of  the  passenger  and  cargo sections used as retail display space.  

#### Cargo Bay

This been increased at the expense  of  the  passenger  seating.  The bulkhead  between  the  two  sections  has been removed  and  replaced  with  a  wide  mesh cargo webbing not shown on these plans. 

## 20-ton Estate Launch 
![](20tonestatelaunch.png)

This version is used on continental and planetary-sized estates as a portable office for estate managers and the like.  Similar versions are used on large estates, farms, plantations, and ranches as well as parks and wilderness preserves. 

### Passenger/Cargo Section

5. **Airlock:** See p. 2. 
5. **Fresher:** See p. 2. 
#### Passenger Seating Modifications
Passenger seating has been reduced to three roomy seats, one of which is a workstation (`7a`). 

#### Cargo Bay Modifications

The cargo bay has been expanded at the expense of the passenger seating. 


## 20-ton Gig

![](20tongig.png)
This is the armed version of the standard launch, and is assigned to vessels or installations requiring protection, but where the threat is not well-equipped. The gig is not very well armored or armed, and is not a substitute for a conventional fighter, but can serve with a customs patrol, rural constabulary or private security force. 

The engineering section is identical to the standard version, but fuel capacity has been reduced  in order to accommodate the weapon and its mount (which extends into the tankage below floor level not shown on this plan). 

### Cockpit

The [[#fresher]] (`6`) and the starboard [[#Supply Locker]] (`4a`) have been relocated to the rear in order to make room for a single [[beam laser]] (`7a`) in a fixed mount. The weapon can be fired from either the [[#Pilot’s Station]] or the [[#Flight Engineer’s Station]].
### Passenger/Cargo Section

#### Passenger Seating Modifications
Passenger seating has  been  reduced  to  four  roomy  seats. These  are  sometimes  used  to  carry  an armed fireteam for boarding purposes.
