# Demilitarized Independent Region

An area of space and systems between the [[Imperium|Third Imperium]] and the [[Zhodani Consulate]], agreed upon in the treaties of the [[Fourth Frontier War]], in which neither political entity will deploy their military assets (ground or naval). The systems within the region can be client states of either larger political entity, and are allowed to hire mercenary forces or to field their own military assets, but cannot do so using funding from their patron.
