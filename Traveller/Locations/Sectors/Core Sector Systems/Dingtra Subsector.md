All but one world in Dingtra has retained its original Vilani name; Glimmer, which is probably just acorruption of Gimuur Luu, its former (also Vilani) name.  Many of these worlds were cut off from one another during the Long Night but the jump-1 cluster in the rimward portion of the subsector managed to maintain limited contact via a fleet of light freighters and escorts that had belonged to Sharurshid, the venerable Vilani egacorporation. These worlds did not have the resources to become a pocket empire after the Ruleof Man fell but limited contact enabled them to save populations that would have otherwise perished.

The spirit of cooperation lives on in Dingtra, where its four industrial worlds provide goods for the entire subsector. In fact, it has more industrial output than it actually needs because Dingtra has few easily accessible foreign markets. To coreward, the Chasma Sylea Major blocks easy transit. The subsectors to both spinward and trailing are underdeveloped, have relatively small populations and are not attractive to most traders. To rimward is the Saregon subsector, which has four industrial worlds of its own, far more people and a more aggressive culture that bullies Dingtra into submission. There are bold traders who make the long circuit into Fornast and back but by and large Dingtra is an insular subsector more focused on maintaining what it has than trying to become something it is not. In short, Dingtra has not strayed far from its conservative Vilani heritage. Visitors to Dingtra sometimes jokingly refer to it as ‘The land that the Third Imperium forgot’.

With more resources and industrial output than it needs, Dingtraians have an adequate but not exorbitant standard of living. Both the labour and professional castes work hard at their jobs and can expect to take a family vacation once every few years either at Kamsii the ‘pleasure planet’ or another suitable world in the subsector. In addition, most Dingtraian societies are members of one traditional Vilani religion or another with almost no Solomani-inspired faiths among them.

Offworlders often find Dingtraians to be aloof or perhaps even a bit hostile. With the exception of Kadushii, all of Dingtra’s high-population worlds have high Law Levels, showing their preference for strict, orderly societies. Unfortunately, it also reflects intolerance towards foreigners. Dingtraians do not much care for behaviour that strays outside the norm and Travellers to Dingtra’s high-population worlds often get into trouble with law enforcement officers. For this reason, most of these worlds have been given Amber Zone designations. Dingtraian justice is harsh and the court system often assigns long prison sentences for petty infractions. However, Dingtra is after all a part of the Imperium and usually commutes sentences provided that foreign diplomats intercede on an incarcerated Traveller’s behalf. Commuted sentences are usually accompanied by deportation and a lifetime expulsion from the system where the ‘crime’ occurred.

Dingtra is defended by the squadrons of the Imperial Navy’s 274th Fleet, which maintains an alert if standoffish presence at the navy bases in the subsector. The Imperial credo is to protect the space between worlds without interfering in their affairs. Nowhere is this truer than Dingtra where the navy maintains a distinctly separate existence from the locals. While citizens of the subsector do serve in the navy and other military services, most do so without distinction from their respective worlds. Imperial service is neither celebrated nor reviled but merely looked upon as a necessity for membership in the empire.

There is a flipside to that Imperial creed; systems under the Imperium’s protection must abide by its laws and must not move to restrict free trade. Dingtra appears to have a problem with the latter. So little commerce moves into and out of the subsector that the Imperium has become wary. Ultimately it is the responsibility of the subsector nobility to ensure that the worlds under their purview are adhering to the rules but even they have run into trouble penetrating the monolithic Dingtraian culture. Sharurshid maintains an ominous presence in Dingtra and may well be propping up a ‘shadow monopoly’ in which the megacorporation and its shell companies hold all the cards. Imperial inspectors sent to investigate the situation have all too frequently ‘run afoul of the law’ and subsequently found themselves serving time in a gulag. The Imperium is attempting to resolve the problem without making too heavy a play. The age of orbital bombardment and planetary ‘cleansings’ has long passed and officials hope to find a diplomatic solution. Recently they have begun to make inroads with some of the less-populated worlds of the subsector, specifically those which have less authoritarian governments.
