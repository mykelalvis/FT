# INTRODUCTION

The [[Imperium|Third Imperium]] is an enormous interstellar polity, comprising all or part of 28 sectors, containing over 11,000 worlds and inhabited by more than 18 trillion sophonts. The primary means of holding this vast empire together is the promise of free trade between its worlds, the administrative efforts of the feudal nobility and the defensive capabilities of the powerful Imperial Navy. Despite the presence of these organizational structures, Imperial worlds are largely left to their own devices. There is no uniform code of planetary law, mode of government or common level of technology. Provided that Imperial laws are not broken – most of which are left deliberately vague and open to interpretation – individual worlds can expect minimal interference in their affairs.

In such an environment, it is not uncommon for a massively populated, high-tech industrial world to be a few parsecs away from a provincial backwater. The world of [[Adan]] (in the [[Core sector]] ) is an example of the latter. Despite appearances, [[Adan]] is not some frontier world on the outskirts of Imperial space but various factors have conspired to make it look like one. [[Adan]] is tucked away on the spinward spur of the [[Saregon Main]]. While tramp traders and a few subsidized merchants sometimes wander into the [[Adan]] system, there are a few impediments to keep them from making it a regular stop. The first is the proximity of the Chanestin Worlds. This troubled region was once home to the Chanestin Kingdom, a sizeable pocket empire whose history goes back thousands of years into the depths of the Long Night. [[The Chanestin Kingdom]] fought a century-long war with the Sylean Federation and its successor state, the Third Imperium, by whom they were ultimately defeated. Despite being conquered and pacified, the Chanestin people have never been fully integrated into Imperial society and have resisted all efforts to bring them into the fold, some worlds more than others. The resistance is so strong on many Chanestin worlds that they have been classified as Amber Zones. The people of these worlds are reluctant to participate in the greater interstellar community, making the region an unsavory environment for trade.

An additional impediment is [[Adan]]'s astrographic location. While the world is not without its charms and has niche agricultural products to offer, it is not an essential stop for traders, most of whom skip it for more lucrative markets. The final factor is the regrettable two- to three-parsec gap between the coreward [[Dunea subsector]] and the rimward worlds of Chant, most of which are backwaters and depressed markets in their own right. Combined, these factors have isolated [[Adan]] in spite of its intriguing potential as a producer of exotic wines, spirits, spices and rare delicacies. [[Adan]] is classified as a rich world but circumstances prevent its people from benefitting from that wealth.

A little known fact about [[Adan]] is that it is struggling for its very survival. It has a unique ecosphere on the verge of collapse. [[Adan]] is a virtual desert world, with a shade less than 10 percent of its surface covered by water. Desert and near-desert worlds are not uncommon but those with breathable atmospheres and well-developed native life are unusual. When the collapse shall happen is uncertain but many of its inhabitants are not sitting idly by waiting for it. They are doing everything in their power to preserve their unusual homeworld, including the enlistment of the Community, a sect of desert dwellers highly attuned to [[Adan]]'s peculiar environment who might represent the world's best hope for survival. Unfortunately, there are forces at work that intend to abolish the Community, offworlders who have come to [[Adan]] with an axe to grind and something to prove. They want to make an example of Adan, sending a message to others like it that give safe harbour to people like those from the Community.

## RUNNING ERRANT LIGHTNING

This adventure begins on the world of [[Adan]] in the [[Core sector]] . With some modification, the Referee could relocate the adventure to a similar world elsewhere, as long as it has a breathable atmosphere and low hydrographics. While [[Adan]] is a backwater with a population in the millions, the adventure could take place on a more populated world with higher interstellar traffic but a fiction must be invented in which a rural community of psionic exiles are allowed to exist in the outback of that world. If the adventure takes place in the Imperium, there is a great deal of prejudice against psions, a key plot element of this adventure. If moved beyond Imperial borders, the world on which the adventure occurs must be close to an anti-psionic world or polity that imposes itself upon them.

Travellers can be brought into the story a number of ways. They might come to [[Adan]] after hearing about its rare agricultural products or unusual environment. Since [[Adan]] is a backwater, the adventure might be initiated on a neighboring world and then move to [[Adan]] based on rumors, a patron encounter or similar hook. [[#Nesin Colport]] could be presented as a patron, a provincial visitor who requires assistance after becoming lost and bewildered on a more urban and cosmopolitan world than the one to which he is accustomed. After introductions are made, Colport offers the Travellers employment on Adan.

The adventure also provides an opportunity for a group of Travellers that has one or more psions among them. _Errant Lightning_ presents psionics in a favorable light. The Community is a group of psions trying to serve as productive members of society in spite of the prejudices against them. A psionic Traveller might sympathise with the Community and be driven to help them.

## OVERVIEW

In _Errant Lightning_ , the Travellers come to Adan, likely at the behest of Colport, a civilian administrator from the world's government. The nature of the help rendered depends on the Travellers and their connection to [[Adan]] (or lack thereof). Colport leads a mysterious development project that has something to do with the Clench, a perennial thatch of plant life that extends from the Cleft, [[Adan]]'s single large body of water.

The planetary government is working in concert with the Community, a sect of desert-dwelling psions who live a spartan existence in a rural mountain range. They are exiles whose talents are illegal in the Imperium but who have established a relationship with the government to help address their world's challenging ecological issues.

Colport introduces the Travellers to Jaymeen Salassim and the two men take them on a journey along the southern flank of the Clench to the mountainous Western Surge. The journey familiarises the Travellers with [[Adan]] and gives them a sense of the challenges faced by its people, knowledge which turns out to be important later in the adventure.

Upon their return to the capital, there are unexpected arrivals from offworld: Doctors Channas and Hortensia Brummac from Massilia Research Station Gamma have come to [[Adan]] with a section of mercenary soldiers. They claim to have invented a treatment that strips psions of their talents, enabling them to become full-fledged members of Imperial society. They intend to 'help' members of the Community by administering the treatment to them, thereby making [[Adan]] into a case study that might then be used to treat psions throughout Imperial space. The Brummacs claim to have an Imperial warrant that permits them to perform their experiments. Among those inducted into the program is Salassim. The Travellers must find a way to extract him and other captured psions from the Brummac compound as quickly as possible.

Ultimately the Brummacs and their mercenaries discover the secret location of a Community outpost, deep in the desert. In a violent showdown, the Travellers and their allies must prevent the Brummacs from dismantling the project and destroying the outpost. The confrontation occurs in the dunes near the Western Surge, where hover chariots crewed by the Travellers face off against a squad of 'dune jumpers' used by the mercenaries. The dangerous encounter is made more challenging by the environment, including sinkholes and a violent electrical storm.

Should the Travellers and their allies survive the encounter, defeat the mercenaries and save the project, they bear witness to an amazing event in which the Clench is psionically assisted to do something it has never done before.

## Recommended Materials

In addition to the Traveller Core Rulebook , the Referee should have the Central Supply Catalogue , which describes equipment that the Travellers may find useful when journeying through the desert, and the Vehicle Handbook , which includes vehicle designs used in the adventure and guidance for modifying existing designs. The Referee should also have The Third Imperium, which provides details about the culture, history, politics and worlds of the Core.

# REFEREE'S INFORMATION

The following information is for the Referee, providing broader knowledge of the setting in which this adventure occurs and imparting a deeper understanding of the events and encounters that transpire over its course. As the adventure unfolds, some or all of this data might be made available to the Travellers but that is largely dependent on their actions and the will of the Referee.

Much of this data could be obtained from public information systems, a ship's Library software or by interacting with people at a starport bar or similar venues. Keep in mind that any information the Travellers discover might be out of date, biased or obscured by forces beyond their control. Partial information and misinformation are often stumbling blocks on the road to becoming fully informed. The process of putting together the pieces of the puzzle can be an enjoyable and fulfilling experience in and of itself.

## THE PSIONIC SUPPRESSIONS

The practice of psionics was never fully embraced in the Imperium but there had been psionics clubs, institutions and university programs since the Sylean Federation era. Prior to the formation of the Third Imperium, there were even worlds in what is now Imperial space that were governed by psionic leaders.

Psions once occupied many roles throughout the Imperium, often serving as aides to the Emperor, members of the Moot and megacorporate officers. There were specialized psionic soldiers in military and intelligence agencies. Psions found unique niches to fill throughout Imperial society. However, the discovery in 772 that the Imperium had been infiltrated by the Zhodani Consulate set loose a wave of anti-psionic hysteria. Scandals extended to all levels of society and Imperial citizens questioned whether their leaders had been compromised by mind-controlling psions with nefarious agendas. People began to question the financial, ethical and moral implications of using psionics.

In 800, Empress Paula II signed the first of 65 suppression orders for all psionic institutes operating within Imperial space, ordering them to cease operations and training programs immediately. By 826, the institutes had their charters revoked and practicing psions were forced underground.

Not everyone agreed with the suppression movement. The Imperial megacorporation SuSAG had a highly profitable psionic drug business and was badly damaged by the suppressions. Many psionically sensitive alien species – including the Droyne, who had just been declared a Major Race in 790 – were affected by these events as well. The IISS promptly interdicted the Droyne worlds of Andor and Candory in the Spinward Marches and the Imperial Navy sent a follow-up mission to secure the two worlds. Similar missions were conducted throughout Imperial space.

The Psionic Suppressions were highly successful but some wondered whether the Imperium had gone too far. The public had been gripped by mass hysteria, so easily condemning an element of society that had long been thought benign.

## THE COMMUNITY

The Psionic Suppressions ended nearly 300 years ago. After the closure of the Imperium's 65 official psionic institutes, furlough of psionic military operatives and programs, cancellation of university psionicology departments and suppression of hundreds of psionic clubs and organizations, the presence of psions was drastically reduced in Imperial space. Those with public personas were outcast from society. Many were forced out of the Imperium altogether. Those who kept their talents private ceased using their abilities publicly or went underground to avoid scrutiny. A scant two decades after the Suppressions ended, an entire generation of psionic potential had gone to waste and with each subsequent generation thereafter, the number of qualified psions was reduced even further. In modern times, only two institutes remain, one on Terra in the Solomani Rim and the other on Wypoc in the Spinward Marches, both ostensibly kept around to ensure the Imperium maintains knowledge and understanding of psionics, even if it publicly vilifies them.

In spite of all this, psionics still exist in Imperial space in the year 1105, even after centuries of suppression and neglect. Psions are exiles, living harried existences, always on the run and in fear of being discovered, arrested and prosecuted for possessing mental talents they did not ask for but were unable to repress. Some are members of pseudo-religious organizations. Others are 'wild talents', self-trained individuals whose abilities were so prodigious they did not require formal instruction to develop them. A select few are current or former members of military organizations that operate in secret, providing the Imperium with a last line of defence against the Zhodani Consulate and other governments and alien species that use psionics.

The Community on [[Adan]] is a collection of exiles from different backgrounds. Most are wild talents who, after a lifetime of dodging the authorities, have made their way to sanctuary on a world that few visit and no one cares about, a place where they can disappear into the wilds and live among their own. After decades of coexistence with the natives of Adan, they have found a productive role in society. While most members of the Community continue to keep their distance from urban areas, the majority of the non-psionic populace have come to recognize them as partners, people whom they can trust and who contribute to the betterment of life on Adan.

Imperial intelligence agencies have occasionally shown mild interest in the Community, sending agents to investigate whether or not this purported group of exiled psions actually exists and if so, whether it poses any harm to the Imperium. Most agents have been convinced that the Community is just a myth, a legend created by crackpots and conspiracy theorists. Others conducted more thorough investigations but failed to turn up definitive leads. One way or another, the Community has avoided being outed thus far. That is about to change.

## MASSILIA RESEARCH STATION GAMMA

[[Terelleresika]] ([[Massilia sector]]) is home to Research Station Gamma. Brummac Labs is an independent corporation, co-located with the Imperial-funded research station. The husband-and-wife team who run the organization, Channas and Hortensia Brummac, claim they have invented a procedure that cures psions of their 'maladies', theorizing that psionics are a disease caused by exposure to jumpspace. They claim that after millennia of using jump drives, human and other sophont genomes have been irrevocably altered, their entire species infected with a dormant virus that causes psionics in some individuals. The Brummacs posit that psionics are a curse that threatens to destroy sentient life. They have invented a controversial cure called [[#Psionic Resonance Extraction Treatment]] (PRET) and have come to [[Adan]] to administer it to the Community... if they can find them.

The Brummacs have also made dubious claims that Aslan and Hivers, neither of whom are known to have psionics, have already developed and administered cures to their species over the course of history. Brummac makes frequent appearances in media claiming that 'it is for shame that Humaniti has not yet saved itself from the dangers of psionic infection but we mean to change that'.

[[#Channas Brummac]] has a little secret; he is a psion himself, a former black-ops agent who served with an Imperial intelligence agency. He has a rare talent, counterpsionics, which enables him to inhibit or block the abilities of other psions. The effects of his abilities are rarely permanent but coupled with the torturous techniques employed in the PRET process, he has discovered that his abilities can have lasting effects.

# Dawn on Adan

The Travellers arrive at [[Adan]] Downport as the system's binary pair, Metalhava and Olauvi, have risen in the eastern sky. See [[CA3-1476395883.jpg|the Passage of Numin]] for a map that shows where the twin suns are in the sky over time. The Referee starts the adventure at day 0, early in Numin, and proceeds from there, using the map to measure the passage of the season.

The starport is a pedestrian affair, with only six docking bays, four of which can berth a ship of up to 400 tons with the remaining two sized for small craft. Unrefined fuel is expected to be available but the supply is unreliable. Raw fuel is provided by wildcatters who extract resources from the system's gas giants and bring it to [[Adan]] to sell to starport administration, ostensibly an extraterritorial possession of the Imperium but which operates more as a subsidiary of the local government, the innocuously named Adanian Civilian Administration (ACA). The wildcatters operate ramshackle sublight craft maintained with imported parts and always on the verge of breaking down. The penny-pinching planetary government often refuses to pay the going rate for fuel, causing strikes and shortages. If the Travellers have their own ship, they can expect a delay before being able to acquire fuel unless they can strike a deal with one of the wildcatters.

The startown, if indeed it can be called that, is a collection of local businesses that surrounds the starport, some that cater to visitors but most of which are in the business of storing and shipping agricultural surpluses to visiting traders. Because of the nature of the Clench, Adanians process its harvest once every 30 days or so, which begins just as the system's binary pair sets on the western horizon and lasts for approximately 7–10 days. Therefore, traders who stop at [[Adan]] typically visit during Tarashu, the planet's 18-standard-day night cycle. The ACA only allows surplus trading after the needs of the locals have been met; at least, that is how things _allegedly_ work. The locals have long suspected that high-ranking members of the government skim produce to sell on the black market, regardless of their needs.

The Travellers have been asked to meet Nesin Colport at Zisduum Nagani, the capital city of Adan. The distance between the starport and capital is approximately 1,000 kilometers. The Travellers may take transportation of their own, rent ground vehicles or purchase tickets on a train or airplane. The train station and airport are just outside the boundaries of the startown.

Air/rafts are rare on low-tech [[Adan]] but if the Travellers have one they may use it to make the journey, provided they do not overfly the Clench, which is forbidden by law. Should they travel by ground car, train or their own ground vehicle, they have the opportunity to see the industrious activities of the locals, thousands of whom are harvesting crops along the southern flank of the Clench. When the twin suns are overhead and the Clench is in bloom, Adanian industry is at peak activity. Electric trucks and large tracked crawlers roll along the edge as pickers delve into the Clench, extracting produce from vines and ivies that visibly grow right before the Travellers' eyes. If they choose to make the trip by commercial airplane, they do not see this activity but will likely have the chance to do so later.

If the Travellers make the trip by ground vehicle, roll 2D for every four hours of their journey. On a result of 8+, an encounter or event occurs.

## Zisduum Naganiz

As the Travellers arrive in the capital, they note it is vastly different than [[Adan]] Downport. There is a single hotel and most businesses cater only to the locals. The city center consists of ancient Vilani buildings, the original purpose of which has been lost in the passage of time. A series of domed buildings now host the administrative offices of the ACA. Other nearby buildings have been converted into high-end housing for government officials. There are ruins as well, some of which have been preserved as historical sites and others that have been built upon or incorporated into modern structures. The remainder of the city extends like an outgrowth of the old city center and consists of sandstone structures whose cream-coloured surfaces reflect the heat of the twin suns during Numin.

The Travellers are met by Colport at an office in the government center grounds, overlooking a small winery. Colport officially welcomes them to [[Adan]] and engages them in polite conversation before proceeding to business. The ACA has need of their talents. [[Adan]] is a provincial world and troubleshooters of the Travellers'
calibre are hard to come by.

Taking them outdoors for a pleasant walk in the winery, Colport explains that [[Adan]] is a rich world with a poor outlook. Virtually all of its crops are perennial, which means they only grow for a single day-to-night cycle, when the system's binary pair shines upon them.

|  1  | The Travellers' vehicle is mistaken for that of a vendor. They are flagged down by a farmer and asked how many seasonal labourers they have aboard the vehicle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|  2  | The Travellers' vehicle is swarmed by Adanian bees. The planet has no native insects but several species have been inadvertently imported over the centuries. They must reduce their speed to Very Slow or risk being in an accident. This lasts for 1Dx10 minutes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|  3  | The road takes the Travellers to the edge of the Cleft where they are flagged down by a group of labourers who request their help. A child labourer has been lost in a coastal patch of the Clench. The pickers ask the Travellers to help extract the child. If they try to help, allow them to make a Difficult (10+) Athletics (dexterity) check to wriggle far enough into the Clench to free the child. If they fail the check, they must make an Average (8+) Navigation check (DEX) to find their way back out. |
|  4  | A dust storm impedes the Travellers' progress. They meet a group of workers seeking shelter, some of whom require medical attention from being stricken by torrents of dust and gravel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|  5  | The vines have breached an artesian well and the roads are flooded, diverting the Travellers by 1D hours. Make an Average (8+) Navigation check (INT) to reduce the time by a number of hours equal to the Effect of the check, with a minimum one-hour diversion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|  6  | Hijackers have stolen a truck full of valuable bramblewine grapes and the victims of the theft ask the Travellers to hunt them down. The hijackers are unarmed but will put up a fight if the Travellers attempt to stop them, attempting to ram their vehicle off the road.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

This, in and of itself, is not terribly unusual. There are 11,000 star systems in the Imperium, each of which has unique characteristics. As Humaniti and other starfaring species have colonized Charted Space, they have had to adjust to thousands of challenging conditions. While Adanians have perfected techniques that allow them to farm the Clench's crops, the sensitive plant life of the planet does not easily lend itself to agriculture. Therefore, most of the harvest is taken directly from the Clench itself, not from farms. Should the Clench ever experience a significant decline in production, the results would be dire. Unfortunately, just such a thing is happening but with the help of the Travellers and the Community, [[Adan]] might be able to avert catastrophe.

Colport invites the Travellers to stay at the Zisduum Nagani Arms, the only hotel in town. He is arranging for transportation that will take them to the extents of the Clench in the morning. Provisions and desert gear will be provided but he urges them to purchase anything else they might want at the market bazaar. Since a complete day on [[Adan]] is 44 standard days long, the locals operate on a nominal schedule with 24-hour 'days' that traditionally consist of a sleep period, a work period, an afternoon rest or 'siesta', a second abbreviated work period, followed by time for an evening meal, relaxation and return to sleep. At the time of the Travellers' visit, they are approaching the second work period, so there is time for them to buy whatever they want at the bazaar before grabbing an evening meal and a good night's sleep.

### Market Bazaar

The offerings available at the bazaar are limited to TL6 but most are significantly lower. Any technological items they find have probably been salvaged from the desert. The bulk of products are hand-crafted clothing and household items of varying quality, including painted ceramics, sarapes, head scarves and unusual musical instruments unique to Adan. If the Travellers indicate that they are planning a journey into the desert, they are offered lightweight hooded robes called canja, the traditional garb of Adanian farmers and pickers. The robes range from plain white to colourfully dyed. They offer no discernible benefit other than comfort and anonymity.

## JOURNEY INTO THE DESERT

In the morning, Colport meets the Travellers at the hotel and escorts them on a short walk to the seaport, where they are introduced to Jaymeen Salassim, who presides over a squadron of 10 weathered hover chariots. The ACA maintains a fleet of these vehicles for various purposes, most of which involve around travelling to and observing Clench growth and harvesting activities. Each hover chariot has room for a driver and passenger. Colport and Jaymeen provide one hover chariot for each Traveller with the Drive skill but the Travellers may pair up as desired. If less than half of the Travellers have the skill, drivers are provided from the ACA.

An array of equipment is neatly laid out next to the vehicles, to be distributed to the Travellers. The equipment includes a [[\\\[Central Supply Catalog#Desert Kit|desert kit]], filter mask, polarised goggles and advanced desert suit, as described in the _[[Central Supply Catalog]]_. The suits were long ago imported from Shinzarkan and appear to be quite worn out, with stitches and patches sealing tears and holes. Everyone on Colport's team wears one and he urges the Travellers to do the same. In addition, lightweight riding helmets and rations for up to 10 days are provided for each individual in the group.

After everyone is geared up and ready to go, Colport urges the Travellers to mount up and follow their lead into the desert. Salassim drives one of the chariots, taking Colport as his passenger. Colport links the chariot radios and implores the Travellers to take it slowly at first. Once they have cleared the seaport and adjacent agricultural zone, they can drive the chariots at higher speeds.

The chariots are simple low-tech conveyances, designed for long-distance travel. Despite their rustic appearance, they are agile and fast, providing their drivers with Agility DM+2 and a top speed of 300 kilometers per hour. They have a 4,500-kilometer journey ahead of them and Colport cautions them that pushing the chariots to their maximum speed is somewhat less safe but ultimately leaves the decision to them regarding how fast they want to travel.

After giving the Travellers a half hour or so to get accustomed to the vehicles, Colport transmits the proposed route to them. The navigation computer is quite primitive, but outlines three milestones on the journey: the harvest zone, the Clench extents and the western reach. Colport and Salassim have something to show them at each stop and hope to collect the astute observations of the Travellers after they have had time to assess what they have seen.

The journey can have as many stops as the Travellers want. While the journey does have a set course, Colport and Salassim do not attempt to overly control or direct their actions. The point of the excursion is to give the Travellers a greater understanding of the Adanian ecosphere. For simplicity, the map of the journey has four listed stops, each of which provides an opportunity for the Travellers to learn something different. Many of the events and encounters described can be rearranged in any way the Referee sees fit. However, the events described at the first and final stops must occur when the Travellers depart and have reached the Western Reach, respectively.

## Hover Chariot

Hover chariots are bare-bones contraptions with little in the way of creature comforts. They are equipped with auxiliary batteries that increase their range by 330 kilometers. Auxiliary batteries consume one Space and may be removed to accommodate other equipment if necessary. The standard and auxiliary batteries can be recharged manually or with solar panels deployed from the vehicle cupola. A full recharge requires approximately four hours provided the binary pair are shining overhead.

The Travellers must take precautions and monitor the integrity of their advanced desert suits to ensure their safety under these conditions.

Conditions range from dry a few kilometers from the Clench, to subhumid within a kilometer to humid when close to its flora. Burst cordons provide temperature relief, creating temporary rivers and streams along the length of the Clench. Temperatures range from 20° at dawn to 43° with the binary pair directly overhead.

## Departure

Distance to Next Milestone: 2,250km
**Climate:** Marine, gradually giving way to desert plains

The first part of the journey features the Travellers' departure from the Zisduum Nagani seaport, a gradual transition from the mild marine climate to the increasing heat of the desert plains. Have the Travellers make an Easy (4+) Drive (hovercraft) check (DEX) every four hours of travel. The task difficulty increases to Routine (6+) if they travel at maximum speed. Success indicates that they have no problems. As they become more familiar with the hover chariots, success with Effect 2+ may be used to conduct a Stunt, as described on page 133 of the _Traveller Core Rulebook_. In the desert plains, this might allow them to jump off of a low rise or something similar. Along the Clench, a stunt might be used to jump over tendrils and vines by lifting up on the throttle. Provide a description of the scene and allow the Travellers some creativity when dealing with various geographic features. Their growing skillsets will come in handy later in the adventure.

Halfway through this segment, they arrive at the southern edge of the Clench. The flora has extended itself far into the desert. It requires an immense amount of hydraulic energy for the plants to accomplish this feat. The vine cordons build thick skins and range from two to five meters in diameter and pile upon each other 10–20 meters high, looking like massed green oil pipelines. On the return trip, observant Travellers might note that the cordons have doubled or tripled in diameter in order to pump the massive amount of water required from the Cleft to feed tendrils and brambles thousands of kilometers away in the western desert.

There are few pickers present here; most have moved on to the buds and floral blooms of the harvest zone, which continues to move into the desert at an average rate of five kilometers per hour. However, there are government workers present, tending to the health of the cordons and spraying pesticides to keep insects and vermin from damaging them. While [[Adan]] has no complex native life forms, imported insects and animals have inevitably invaded the ecosphere over the millennia. The maintenance workers and pickers they encounter have durable trucks and SUVs for transportation and sleep in tents that are propped 50–100 meters from the Clench.

Now they are deep in the desert, have each of the Travellers make a Routine (6+) Survival check each day. The Difficulty is reduced to Easy (4+) if they wear the advanced desert suits provided for them. Success indicates they have not succumbed to the heat and dryness of the desert. Failure results in 'desert fatigue', which is a combination of heat exhaustion and exposure to the unfamiliar ecosphere of the planet with its unique dusts and pollens. Travellers affected by desert fatigue suffer DM-1 on all checks until they rest and rehydrate for eight hours.

Allow the Travellers to stop and check things out as much as they like during this segment of the journey. Colport and Salassim are present to answer any questions they might have.

### Event

One of the natural hazards that occurs on this portion of the Clench are cordon bursts. In order to continue the Clench's westward growth, the eastern portion must gradually grow to enormous size in order to carry water from the Cleft to the extents. Intense pressure builds up in the cordons and their walls must grow in thickness and durability. During this interim phase of Clench growth, some of the cordons fail to develop adequate walls and they burst, pouring millions of litres of water into the desert. As it writhes and spirals into the desert, nature decides which of the thousands of cordons are healthy enough to carry the water; those that do not make the grade atrophy and split, causing minor floods along the length of the Clench. The spilled water serves an important role; feeding the mossy, fungal 'undermat' that protects the Clench from harsh desert sands.

Harvesting this region is dangerous and pickers are sometimes caught in flood zones. Over the centuries, Adanians have noted warning signs of an impending cordon burst and become skilled at avoiding loss of life. Nevertheless, some pickers and a few harvest managers inevitably drown each season. Most harvesting operations are low-tech affairs and rescue teams and vehicles are often out of range to save people who inadvertently find themselves in a flood zone. As luck would have it, one such burst occurs while the Travellers are near. A family of pickers and their harvest manager have become trapped among the ruts and eddies created by the flood. Sometimes people can sit these out and then simply trek back to safety through muddy sand but this one appears to be more dangerous. The burst cordon shows no signs of abating and looks as if it will completely flood the area, likely drowning the victims. The Travellers can mount a rescue operation with their hovercraft. This can be resolved by playing out the events or abstracted by making Navigation, Drive and possibly Survival checks to find victims and get them to safety.

## Harvest Zone

Distance to Next Milestone: 1,500km Climate: Open desert initially, giving way to Clench microclimate

On the second segment of the journey, the Clench cordons become smaller and thousands of brambles, blooms and tendrils begin to appear at its edges.

These, too, will eventually be pressed ever outward into the desert as the cordons grow to support the growing Clench. The picker population increases exponentially. Thousands harvest the blooms, picking fruits and grains from among the flora. Mobile platforms – basically large, flatbed trucks with separate containers for different crops – roll alongside the Clench at a distance of about 100 meters. The pickers make their way back and forth between the platforms and the Clench. The process is inefficient but there are strict laws that govern how close motorised vehicles may approach the Clench.

Harvest managers oversee the pickers and the often unwelcome presence of government administrators looms over the operation. The administrators are scientists from the ACA who are there to ensure the harvesters do not over pick the Clench. The harvesters want to maximise their bounty while administrators are present to ensure that irreversible damage is not done to the Clench. A significant amount of blooms and brambles must be allowed to continue westward lest its growth be stunted. It is crucial for the Adanian ecosphere that the Clench reach its maximum length. The harvesters argue it is also essential they obtain enough of a bounty to make a living.

Colport and Salassim bring the Travellers close enough to observe the Clench in action. Its visible growth is a sight to see. It is a lot like watching fast-motion photography of a flower blooming or the stalk of a plant growing over several hours or days but in real time and on a massive scale. Reaching into the dense foliage of the writhing Clench to extract the produce requires dextrous hands and agile feet. Getting far enough in to get the best fruits and grains often results in entanglement but the pickers are accustomed to the work. They are skilled at getting in far enough to obtain what they want and then stepping, dancing and if necessary climbing back out as the brambles threaten to engulf them. Salassim seems very comfortable with the plant life of the Clench, casually stepping into its clutches to grab some fresh fruit for the Travellers to eat and then deftly stepping back out without issue. Colport keeps his distance, urging Salassim to take care. Salassim offers to teach the Travellers how to be skilled pickers if they are willing to learn.

Being a good picker is all about observation, strategy and fast, deliberate execution. If one takes a few moments to watch a part of the Clench, movement patterns can be identified that can be exploited. Then merely step into the brambles quickly, extract the produce and get back out before becoming entangled. For Travellers who attempt it, have them perform a task chain with a Routine (6+) INT check (1D seconds) to make the observation, followed by an Average (8+) Athletics (dexterity) check (1D rounds). A high Effect indicates the acquisition of a greater bounty, perhaps a whole basket worth of produce. Failure means the target was obscured by other foliage before it could be extracted. Failure with Effect -2 or worse indicates entanglement. In most cases, a successful STR or DEX check gets one free but the help of a nearby fellow picker is sometimes required.

### Event

While Colport and Salassim are otherwise engaged, the Travellers witness a conflict between a harvest manager and a government scientist that looks like it might get ugly. The harvest manager argues that with the decreased bounties the farms are seeing, the people will not have enough resources for the coming Tarashu. The scientist argues that if they exploit the brambles too aggressively, they risk causing ecological damage. Without the photosynthesis cycle of Numin, [[Adan]] will see a gradual decline in oxygen production, with a resultant reduction in pollen, which increases the planet's albedo. Overexploitation risks causing a chain reaction decline that threatens the entire planet.

The scientist and his small team are outnumbered by the harvest manager and several angry-looking pickers. The Travellers may choose to get involved. If they do not, the government science team receives a severe beating.

## The Clench Extents

Distance to Next Milestone: 750km
**Climate:** Clench microclimate

As the Travellers and their guides approach the extents of the Clench, they witness a gradual decline in pickers and an increase in 'picker drones'. These are imported robots of TL7–9, small helicopters and ornithopters that buzz around the extents of the Clench, picking and gathering produce on the periphery like busy mechanical bees. Because of a lack of proper infrastructure and maintenance for the drone fleet, they present a danger to human pickers. It might seem irresponsible to subject human pickers to these hazards but not every harvester has the budget to support a fleet of fruit-picking robots.

These are the bleeding edges of the Clench, where its tendrils are low to the ground and voraciously crawling deeper into the desert. The Travellers have 'rounded the bend' and can now see the Clench coming straight at them. Gone are the enormous cordons, which are replaced by much smaller vines and tendrils. Likewise, the mossy undermats rarely develop this far from the Cleft. However, the fungal spores of the species that produce the mats are present, floating about in the air and creating a respiratory hazard. Normally these would settle beneath cordons and create a healthy surface for them to grow upon but since the Clench does not fully develop this far out, most simply blow away in the wind. Many eventually settle in the far reaches of the desert, growing on the rocks of the surges, creating and supporting life in arid zones that would otherwise be completely dead. Colport and Salassim urge the Travellers to don filter masks as they come close to the Clench extents to prevent them from suffering respiratory difficulty.

Shortly after reaching the extents, the group is greeted by a woman named Taniin, who rides onto the scene in a hover chariot identical to the ones the Travellers are using. Taniin appears to have driven in from the west which, if they have looked at the maps of Adan, is open desert for about 1,000 kilometers until the mountains of the Western Surge appear.

### Event

Colport and Salassim inform the Travellers that despite the dangers, some of the most valuable and delectable fruits of the Clench are present within the extents. Extracting them is quite dangerous due to the unpredictable movements of the serpentine vines. Salassim offers to guide them into the hostile brambles if they wish. He assures them that in spite of the dangers, they will be just fine. If the Travellers opt to go, Salassim steps away from the group for a few minutes, closes his eyes and appears to enter a state of deep concentration, after which he guides them into the writhing tendrils. He seems confident in spite of the danger. Colport follows the group from behind, the dapper administrator seeming quite out of place but only marginally less confident than Salassim.

The Referee should build up the tension during this scene, having the Travellers make Navigation or Survival checks to avoid being separated from the group and a few Athletics or DEX checks to avoid becoming entangled in the tendrils. During their foray into the brambles, allow the Travellers to collect rare bramblegrapes and other hard-to-obtain produce. Colport urges them to take as much as they can carry; their group is far too small to have a deleterious effect on Clench growth.

At this point, the Travellers might not be aware that Salassim is a psion from the Community. He uses his Clairvoyant talents to identify a safe path and his Botanical Symbiosis talent to 'pave the way' for them. Meanwhile, Taniin uses Telekinesis to push aside any particularly aggressive tendril growths as they make their way into the bramble. While there are still dangers present, the use of psionic talents enables the group to get in and back out safely. However, the Clench itself is not the only danger, as they soon discover.

The Referee may optionally allow observant Travellers to make a Difficult (10+) INT check to notice the psions using their abilities during this scene. If there are psions among the Travellers, they need not make a check; they simply recognize the tell-tale signs of a fellow psion using abilities.

Unless they make an effort to be sneaky when entering the Clench, the Travellers are seen by a drone-controlling harvester who had his sights set on the region they went into. The Travellers are attacked by 1D picker drones. The harvester only intends to harass them, forcing their withdrawal from the Clench, so he can obtain the produce they are collecting. He certainly does not intend to kill anyone. If the Travellers are armed and manage to destroy one or two of the drones, the harvester withdraws the remainder of them and retreats to his hovercraft, attempting to escape the scene of the crime before he can be apprehended.

## The Western Reach

Distance to Next Milestone: n/a Climate: Open desert

After the excitement of the extents, the Travellers and their guides embark upon the final phase of their journey, which takes them over the horizon and into open desert. As the Clench disappears in their rear-view mirrors, Colport radios the Travellers to warn them about a hazard of the Adanian desert: sinkholes. Chunks of porous regolith combine with desert sands to create loose and unstable surfaces. Many give way to sinkholes, most of which are only a few meters deep but some open into large, deep chasms, up to several hundred meters in depth. Experienced desert rangers can identify sinkholes from afar by spotting discolouration in the sandy surface.

![[CA3-1476395899.jpg|200]]

> [!note] Renegade Picker Drone
> While many picker drones seem to have blatant disregard for human pickers, some seem to be outwardly hostile. On the surface, this might seem ridiculous but it actually makes some sense. The humans and drones are in competition for the rich bounties of the Clench extents, fruits that produce some of [[Adan]]'s finest wines and liqueurs. The Adanian outback can be a lawless place and skulduggery like this occurs more often than the ACA would care to admit.

As the group comes upon the open dunes, Colport urges them all to slow down to half cruising speed and follow in single file to avoid a sinkhole mishap. A skilled hovercraft pilot can sometimes avoid falling into a sinkhole even after inadvertently collapsing one. As the sand and regolith give way to the gaping hole, the driver can gun the engines to accelerate out of the trap but the best thing is to avoid them altogether. Colport describes the features and discolouration to look for and then reforms the group into a wedge formation with his hover chariot taking point, so the Travellers can see an example for themselves. As they come upon a buried sinkhole, he has the group stop so they can identify its characteristics. Coming up slowly, it is easy to see the differences in consistency and colour; however, it is equally easy to overlook such a feature when driving through the desert at high speed. Salassim deliberately takes their hover chariot near the edge, causing the discoloured sand and regolith slurry to break and collapse, revealing a sinkhole five meters deep.

![[CA3-1476395903.jpg|100]]
[[CA3-1476395903.jpg|Sinkhole]]

After this experience, allow the Travellers the opportunity to identify additional sinkholes as they proceed further into the desert at half cruising speed. The Referee should make a Routine (6+) Recon check (DEX or INT) for Colport and Salassim, who are experienced at spotting them but have the Travellers make Average (8+) Recon checks (DEX or INT) until they have successfully spotted several. Reduce the difficulty to Routine (6+) after the Travellers have become experienced sinkhole spotters. Note that travelling at full cruising speed increases the difficulty by one level and going full speed increases it by two.

Failure to spot a sinkhole results in a possible hazard. For every hour travelled in the open desert, the Referee should roll 2D for each vehicle. If the result is 10+, the vehicle encounters a sinkhole. Allow the Travellers to make Recon checks, as described before. If they detect its presence, they may simply avoid the covered sinkhole and continue on their merry way. If they fail to detect it, they inadvertently drive over it, causing a collapse. Roll 2D to determine its depth. On a result of 2–10, the sinkhole is 2D meters deep. On a result of 11+, the sinkhole is extremely deep, subject to Referee fiat with a maximum depth of a few hundred meters.

Crashing into a sinkhole does 1D damage to the vehicle for every two meters of depth. The hover chariots are lightweight and not very durable. A sinkhole of just about any size is likely to wreck the vehicle. Any damage that surpasses the armor and hull of the hover chariot is applied to its driver and passenger, which can be quite deadly.

All is not lost if a Traveller accidentally causes a collapse. After a failed check, allow the driver to make a Difficult (10+) Drive (hovercraft) check (DEX) to avoid plunging into the sinkhole. Failing this, there are still ways for the Traveller to avoid potentially fatal damage. Hover chariots are open vehicles, which makes them easy to get into and out of. While the Travellers should have their restraining harnesses buckled, they might be able to get loose and jump free of the vehicle by making a Difficult (10+) Athletics check (DEX). A successful check means the Traveller jumped from the vehicle in time, landing next to the sinkhole. Keep in mind that the hover chariot was probably travelling at considerable speed, so even a successful Athletics check results in the Traveller taking 2D damage for every 20 kilometers per hour the vehicle was travelling.

The Adanian desert is a dangerous place and not easy to traverse on the ground. Unfortunately, the ground is just where the Travellers must be if they are to solve the mysteries of the Clench. After a possibly harrowing journey 300+ kilometers beyond the farthest reaches of the Clench, Colport halts the flotilla and instructs the group to make camp. As he does so, the Travellers might note gathering cumulonimbus clouds overhead. Colport says that desert storms are common as Numin comes to a close. These early cloud formations portend big storms this season.

## Questions and Answers

After making camp in the desert, Colport prepares the group a spartan, but nicely seasoned, meal served with a few bottles of above-average bramblewine. Salassim sets up a tarp for shade. When describing the scene, the Referee should keep in mind that 'night' during Numin is part of a nominal day. When the Travellers and their guides eventually enter their tents to sleep, they will do so under full daylight conditions. As they make camp, Colport distributes small cooling units for each of their tents. He urges the Travellers to activate them during sleep as their battery capacities are limited.

> [!Info] Cooling Unit
> Portable cooling units provide relief from the intense desert heat. They are best used in an enclosed area, such as inside a pup tent. Each unit has enough battery capacity for 16 hours of continuous use.

As they enjoy their meal, the Travellers have the opportunity to engage Colport, Salassim and Taniin in conversation. Use selected portions of the Referee's Information section on page 4 to answer some of their questions. The trio are knowledgeable about their world but have little in the way of resources to develop a greater scientific understanding of its inner workings. They hope to solicit the Travellers for their opinions about the Clench and what they might do to better [[Adan]]'s situation. If there are Travellers with Science skills, they might be able to help solve the planet's ecological issues. If they are traders, they might be able to bring much needed technology to Adan. The world is facing imminent famine and offworld technology could mitigate the crisis. If the Travellers are adventurers or mercenaries, they can provide security for the members of the Community, who are about to make themselves much more public than they have been in the past.

The following are answers to some of the questions the Travellers might ask:

> [!Question]- Are you all psions?
> If the Travellers observed Salassim and Taniin using their psionic abilities at the Clench extents, they might want to confirm what they saw. Although reluctant at first, the two admit that they are indeed psions. Should the conversation continue, they describe their individual talents (see Allies and Opposition on page 44). Colport tells them that he is not psionic but was one of the first non-psionic Adanians to reach out to the Community. After years of close association on several projects, Colport and Salassim fell in love. The two men would like to marry one day but fear the reprisals that might occur. While most Adanians have a favorable impression of psionics, there are still many who fear and loathe them. Should the conversation dwell heavily on psionics, Taniin might also inform the Travellers that, much like Salassim, she has a rare psionic talent. She is a changeling, able to impersonate the voices, faces and, with some effort, the entire body of another person. This talent might be used by the Travellers as the adventure proceeds. Having an ally who can become someone else could be advantageous.

> [!Question]- What is the Community?
> A decade ago, explorers discovered that an exile community had somehow managed to eke out an existence in the deserts of the Western Surge. An ACA expedition was sent to make contact with them. The citizens of the Community were initially careful not to reveal that they were psions but, over time, they were seen using their talents to navigate and manage the Clench. The ACA was struggling to address the needs of the people after several subpar harvests and accepted the help of the Community to address some of the challenges they were facing. The ACA downplayed the presence of psionics in the Community, portraying them merely as exiles who had unique knowledge about the desert and the Clench. In the present day, the ACA has been unable to completely squelch rumors about the Community but most people who know about the psions accept their presence without issue. The Community maintains a mostly separate existence from the bulk of the Adanian population but they are seen from time-to-time in various towns and settlements, sometimes even in Zisduum Nagani.

![[CA3-1476395906.jpg|300]]

> [!Question]- What is happening to the Clench?
> Life on [[Adan]] means living off what the Clench produces. Scientists measure the breadth, density and reach of the Clench during each Numin. It has been underperforming for decades now, leading them to believe it is dying and with it, their world. For about a decade, the Clench has been 'behaving' strangely. No longer does it stretch in uniform direction. Its path has been altered slightly with each new Numin. During the past three seasons, the Clench has been wandering to the northwest. What is it reaching for? Perhaps the symbiotic species of the Clench have lost their way and are merely signalling their death knell. Extinction events are commonplace in virtually all ecospheres. It could be that [[Adan]] is about to witness one and there is little they can do about it.
>
> The Community and ACA are working together to help guide the Clench as far as it can go. The task force has set up an outpost in the canyons of the Western Surge to monitor its progress.

> [!Question]- Can we visit the Community?
> Perhaps on a follow-up expedition. Colport and Salassim did not bring enough provisions to survive an extended journey into the Western Surge where the Community is hidden. Furthermore, the Travellers get the sense that while they have become trusted allies, allowing them to visit the Community will require more time. With further cooperation and collaboration, perhaps they can consider bringing the Travellers to visit the Community.

## SECOND OPINIONS

Travellers of a scientific or investigative bent might want to look into the situation on [[Adan]] further. Following are some things that they might do to gain a greater understanding of [[Adan]] and the Clench:

- A starship with Improved sensors includes a densitometer, a technology far beyond the reach of Adan. A low-orbit sensor sweep might reveal some interesting things about the terrain and geology of the north-western desert, including the presence of thousands of previously undetected aquifers.
- Travellers with Science (geology or planetology) might be able to collect more facts about the region. With a scientific toolkit and perhaps some explosives – along with a Traveller who knows how to detonate them properly – they might discover some things that have heretofore been overlooked.
- Travellers with the Survival skill might be able to ascertain what the Clench is doing. If its myriad plant life forms have changed the direction in which they grow, there must be a reason for it.

[[Adan]] has limited resources and relatively few visitors in the interstellar scheme of things. The Travellers have a breadth of experience from visiting, interacting with and, in many cases, surviving alien environments. Colport, Salassim and Taniin hope to leverage that experience to help save their world.

> [!Info]+ THE SECRET OF THE CLENCH
> The symbiotic plant life of the Clench can detect subtle differences in climate that have been guiding its growth. Simply put, the Clench detects underground water in the Surges, the desert mountain ranges thousands of kilometers from the Cleft. The Clench is not a conscious being, at least not in the traditional sense. It relies upon collective sensory, nutritional and meteorological events to guide its path. Like most life forms, the Clench is guided by the will to survive. It somehow collectively understands that its prospects are dim and is unconsciously seeking a way to improve them.
>
> Most of the Surge sites are located over porous parts of the planetary crust, some of which cap extensive aquifers. Many of these subterranean resources contain enough water to create new lakes and seas. If a significant amount of that water could be freed, enabling it to reach the surface, it could drastically improve the fortunes of [[Adan]]'s native life for the foreseeable future.

## THE RETURN

As they break camp the following morning, Taniin expresses her gratitude to the Travellers for coming into the desert to learn more about Adan. She tells them that she will speak with her fellow exiles at the Community to assess their willingness to have them come for a visit. Colport and Salassim bid her a fond farewell, pack up their gear and escort the Travellers on the journey back to Zisduum Nagani.

# UNINVITED GUESTS

![[CA3-1476395908.jpg|100]]
[[CA3-1476395908.jpg|The speech]]

During the return, the Travellers' guides receive radio messages that offworlders have arrived at the city. They have come from the downport via a Behemoth transport helicopter (see page 79 of the _Vehicle Handbook_ ) and taken up residence on the outskirts of Zisduum Nagani in modular housing structures.

As the Travellers reach the outskirts of Zisduum Nagani, possibly exhausted from their time in the outback, they see that a large cargo helicopter lifts off from somewhere on the opposite side of the city and flies to the city center where it sets down in a broad public plaza. If they avoid the scene altogether, perhaps keeping a distance of one or more kilometers from the commotion, they hear a blaring speech being delivered over loudspeakers in the plaza. Whatever is being said is obscured by the buildings of the city. To find out what is going on, they must go closer. In the plaza, they see an event that might be described as somewhere between a political rally, a celebration of martial power and a circus, complete with a performance by a pair of modified industrial walkers.

The helicopter has landed on a wide-open pitch on the periphery of the plaza. Its cargo doors are open but a black curtain conceals its contents. Thousands of people have gathered in the square to see what all the fuss is about and state television news is on hand to record the event. A portable stage and podium have been set up a few meters from the helicopter. Standing around the stage are six mercenary soldiers, carrying slung shotguns and stunner sidearms. At the podium are a man and woman; the man speaks into a microphone mounted on the podium and says to the crowd:

> People of Adan, you have been deceived. You have entered into a suicide pact with a dangerous foe of the Imperium. While you might believe that this alleged 'Community' is your friend, psions are incapable of befriending you. They are sick, enfeebled by an illness inflicted upon our species by millennia of exposure to jumpspace. But have no fear! We are here to save you from them and in so doing, cure them of their maladies. I am Dr. Channas Brummac and this is my wife, Dr. Hortensia Brummac. We come to you from Research Station Gamma on the Terelleresika system of the Massilia sector. Our decades of research in the field of psionicology has enabled us to develop a treatment to cure psions of their illness, enabling them to re-enter society and become respectable citizens of the Imperium. Lead us to the Community and we shall simultaneously save these pour souls while ridding you of the blight which threatens your world.

At the conclusion of Dr. Brummac's speech, the curtains in the helicopter are drawn back and two 'dune jumper' walkers come striding down its gangplank. Each is armed with an autocannon and flamethrower - highly illegal on the streets of any Adanian city – and their helmeted drivers can be seen within. Their dramatic appearance elicits a collective gasp from the gathered onlookers. The display is intended to be a show of strength and a message to both the citizens of [[Adan]] and any members of the Community who might be present. Brummac and his mercenaries are here on [[Adan]] with a mission and they have brought firepower to back them up.

[[CA3-1476395910.jpg|The Dune Jumpers]]

Brummac briefly takes a few questions from the media and local politicians. Some are surprisingly brazen, demanding to know what gives them the right to carry and display arms in violation of local laws. Brummac informs them that he has a warrant from the Imperium, although he declines to display it and is unwilling to say from whom it was issued.

Meanwhile, the two dune jumpers menacingly amble through the crowd, their drivers peering outside the armored shells to look at the people. Some are amazed, others are clearly frightened. The event stops short of causing people to trample each other but hundreds of people promptly leave, obviously in fear. To conclude the event, the drivers turn their dune jumpers back towards the helicopter and engage their auxiliary thrusters, enabling them to hurtle a full 30 meters through the air and land with a sensational thump near the gangplank. The two then climb back into the helicopter just as Dr. Brummac ends his question-and-answer session with the crowd. The doors close and the helicopter dusts off, departing for the outskirts of town where the group has established their makeshift headquarters.

[[CA3-1476395914.jpg|Dune Jumper]]

```
Dune Jumper
The dune jumper is a modified exoskeletal walker crewed by a single driver/gunner. Initially constructed for mining operations on nearby Duunpigamuur, the jumper has had armor and weaponry added to make it an effective military vehicle, including auxiliary thrusters that enable it to make large leaps over obstacles and close on targets. The auxiliary thrusters may be used once every five rounds and increase the dune jumpers' effective speed by one band (from Slow to Medium) for that round only. However, the thrusters heavily tax the battery life of the vehicle. If used extensively – five or more times – they reduce the vehicle's effective range by a third.

## HOME AWAY FROM HOME

The Brummacs' mercenaries have assembled a temporary headquarters and laboratory on the outskirts of Zisduum Nagani. The facility is composed of two complete advanced bases (refer to page 56–57 of the _Central Supply Catalogue_ ), a dedicated power module and four additional modules that have been converted into 'treatment cells'. The mercenaries have also set down a two-meter high cordon of razor wire around the base with a single point of entry.

The cargo helicopter is on a flat piece of land 50 meters from the base. Most of the dune jumpers are inside the helicopter but the mercenaries, who patrol the compound in shifts, typically operate two of them as security units, walking the perimeter of the facility to make sure no civilians approach too closely. An armored van (refer to page 96 of the _Vehicle Handbook_ ) is parked a few meters away from the helicopter.

The final piece of equipment at the compound is a satellite uplink. Before making planetfall on Adan, the Brummacs installed a reconnaissance satellite in close orbit, which is searching for the Community in the desert.

## MEETING THE BRUMMACS

The Brummacs do not exactly open their doors for visitors. On occasion, they depart the base with two to four of the mercenaries, heading into town to meet with various parties.

Should the Travellers attempt to meet the Brummacs, they will not find it easy to obtain an appointment. They have come to [[Adan]] to ferret out exiled psions, not engage in social hour with random people. However, if they present themselves as informers who can help uncover a cabal of psions, they might be able to garner the Brummacs' interest.

Despite their obvious value to Adan, the Community are still under suspicion by many members of society. The prejudice instilled within Imperial citizens – fuelled by a lifetime of propaganda – runs deep, and many would be all too willing to give the psions up. The Brummacs are fielding dozens of calls, most of which turn out to be false leads but some put them on the trail of Adanian psions.

To obtain a meeting with the Brummacs, the Travellers must make a Difficult (10+) Deception check (INT or SOC, 1D hours). Success indicates that the Travellers have concocted a convincing story and are able to gain an audience with the Brummacs. Success with Effect 4+ gains them an invitation to the compound. Failure gets them logged on a list of false informants, making subsequent attempts one difficulty level higher unless the Travellers take steps to cover their tracks. The mercenaries do not have sophisticated tracking gear but their computer and comms equipment is good enough to catalogue devices used to contact them and perform low-grade voice recognition.

If the Travellers are able to obtain a meeting with the Brummacs outside the compound, mercenary Sgt. Bronto Solomei establishes a neutral meeting location with them. This can be a public place somewhere in Zisduum Nagani or the cargo compartment of the armored van, which has been outfitted with a portable table and chairs. The Brummacs do not consent to a meeting in a clandestine location. They know that not everyone welcomes their presence on [[Adan]] and are leery of skulduggery.

If they achieve exceptional success (Effect 4+ on their Deception check), the Travellers are invited to meet with the Brummacs at their compound, enabling them to obtain more details about the mission. If the Travellers get into the compound, allow them to make an Average (8+) Recon check (INT, 1Dx10 minutes) to obtain more information. What they learn is largely up to the Referee and may be enhanced by the Effect of the check. Their findings might include how many dune jumpers the mercenaries have (nine), more about their armament, the Tech Level of their equipment and similar information. If they achieve Effect 4+ on the Recon check, allow them to learn more information about Psionic Resonance Extraction Treatment. The one aspect of the compound that they refuse to discuss under any circumstances is the satellite uplink.

The Brummacs are short and to the point. After brief introductions and little fanfare, they get right to the nitty gritty, asking the Travellers what they know about the Community, where they can find them and how they came by this information. The conversation may take an intimidating turn. While the Brummacs are highly dependent on the information gleaned from meetings like this one, they are remorselessly inquisitive. If word were to get out that the Brummacs interrogate their informants about the sources of their knowledge, the well of willing participants might dry up. The Brummacs are clearly not well-trained in public relations and carry themselves with uncommon hubris and self-righteousness. They pursue every line of questioning with dogged determination, trying to get to the bottom
of any issue that is brought up. When the Travellers walk away from the conversation, they should feel uneasy, as if they are the ones being prosecuted, not just the psions.

> [!info]+ WARRANTS AND SUCH
> If asked about their alleged warrant, the Brummacs avoid specifics. They imply that they have an Imperial Warrant without directly saying so. Imperial warrants are instructions printed on physical or encrypted electronic Imperial stationery from the Emperor, an archduke or a duke and given to trusted agents of the Imperium. These instructions endow the recipient with the will of the Emperor or high nobility and supersede all other powers. Warrants are typically assigned for missions of great importance and often issued in times of crisis when going through official channels is not considered to be a viable option.
>
> The Brummacs refuse to show the Travellers their warrant unless the Travellers somehow manage to invoke a fiction that they are Adanian authorities and have a right to see it. This requires a task chain: First, have one of the Travellers make an opposed Deception check versus a SOC check by Channas Brummac. If the Travellers win the opposed check, they can make a Difficult (10+) Diplomat or Advocate check (SOC) to petition for a formal review. On a successful check, Brummac reluctantly allows them to review the document in a private setting, perhaps the ACA government offices. If they fail, he chides them for poking their noses into his affairs and warns them to 'Watch your backs. You don't want to end up on the wrong side of this investigation.'
>
> If the Travellers manage to obtain access to the warrant, close examination reveals that it does not qualify as an Imperial warrant. The language in the document was certainly designed to create the fiction that it is just such a document; however, it was not issued by the Emperor, an archduke or duke, but from the Count of Dumeras, a powerful high-population world in the Massilia sector. If they take this information to Colport, he runs it through official channels, which ultimately invalidates the Brummacs' mission and expels them from Adan. The process takes about a week. Should this occur, the steadfast Brummacs disassemble their advanced base and move their operation into the western desert, violating the expulsion order. They are quite certain that the Community is real and refuse to be cowed by local authorities. Brummac believes that ultimately his actions will enable him to curry favor with the Imperial bureaucracy, whereupon he is certain that Imperial law will trump local law.
>
> Forcing the Brummacs to relocate has numerous effects, some of which are not readily apparent to the Travellers. Unbeknownst to them, Solomei's mercenaries are in the process of conducting illegal search and seizure operations in Zisduum Nagani. If their mission is allowed to go on undeterred, they eventually arrest Jaymeen Salassim, who is in hiding at Colport's residence. However, if the Travellers' actions lead to an expulsion order, the mercenaries do not get the opportunity to capture Salassim. However, they do arrest several other psions, whom they induct into the PRET treatment program.

![[CA3-1476395919.jpg|100]]
[[CA3-1476395919.jpg|PRET Treatment]]

### PSIONIC RESONANCE EXTRACTION TREATMENT

Psionic Resonance Extraction Treatment (PRET) is a lot of things but it does not truly eliminate psionic abilities, at least not in any permanent way and certainly not in the way presented. Superficially, PRET relies upon an aggressive form of aversion therapy in which patients are restrained in a chair, couch or padded table and then urged to use their psionic talents. As they do so, they are subjected to various aversion catalysts: electric shocks, corporal punishment, drug-induced discomfort and other painful or uncomfortable techniques.

While restrained, patients are also forced to watch holovideos of the Psionic Suppressions, casting the heroes as 'brave souls who fought against the psionic corruption of society' and the villains as Zhodani and other psions who used their abilities to subjugate the 'good and decent' citizens of the Imperium. During scenes showing the 'heroes' of the story, the treatment room is made cool and comfortable, aversion catalysts are suppressed and mild narcotics or sedatives administered to the patient. Conversely, when the 'villains' or the dystopian effects of psionics on society are shown, the room is made uncomfortably warm and aversion catalysts are activated.

For the most part, the aversion therapy component is a smoke screen. In most quarters, such techniques have been debunked. While they can be effective in helping patients curtail unhealthy habits, the use of discomfort and pain to produce a desired effect is considered unethical in medical and rehabilitation fields. The actual active component in the treatment is Dr. Channas Brummac's use of his secret psionic talent. Brummac has a rare talent called counterpsionics (see page 43). This enables him to detect and suppress the use of psionics by others. By timing his use of this on patients during severe applications of aversion catalysts, Brummac has achieved limited success getting psions to stop using their talents. After this stage of the treatment, subsequent psychiatric and psionicological therapies have had a high success rate restoring lost abilities, casting doubt on the efficacy of Brummac's techniques. For this reason, the third phase of the treatment involves removing patients from their native environments, taking them away from friends, associates and family, and giving them a new identity and fresh start far from home. This prevents them from receiving encouragement and subsequent therapies that might restore their abilities.

Unfortunately, the third treatment phase has had detrimental effects on PRET patients. Anxiety, loneliness and depression are common byproducts, often resulting in substance-abuse, drug addiction and suicide. By taking patients away from their homes, sometimes many parsecs away, the Brummacs have been able to whitewash the results, brushing them under the proverbial rug so they can claim high success rates in spite of actual results.

## THE HUNT

Whether or not the Travellers manage to slow them down, the Brummacs and their mercenary force are hot on the trail of the Community. Their search eventually leads to Nesin Colport, whom they arrest and bring to their compound for questioning. Colport is not accustomed to being grilled by experienced interrogators and while he does not give up any key information – such as the location of the Community - they know about his relationship with Jaymeen and push the right buttons to fluster him. Colport reveals that Jaymeen is indeed his romantic partner and rather toothlessly threatens the Brummacs not to harm him. He also inadvertently confesses that Jaymeen is not the only psion in Zisduum Nagani, emboldening the mercenaries to follow up on several leads they are currently chasing.

After a few days, Sgt. Solomei captures two Community psions who are admitted as patients in the PRET program. If the Travellers successfully call the Brummacs' bluff regarding the supposed Imperial warrant (see page 28), the Brummacs are forced to hasten their schedule and only manage to capture these two. However, if the Travellers fail to impede them in any way, they are under no pressure to rush their program and also manage to track down and arrest Jaymeen, whom they also put into PRET. In either case, Colport does what he can to liberate the Community members who have been inducted into the program. He enlists the Travellers' aid to do so.

Getting psions out of the compound is no easy task. Solomei's mercenaries are a disciplined group. They maintain watch over the compound at all times, with three soldiers on security duty in eight-hour shifts. The only way they are likely to give up the compound is if they get solid intelligence on the location of the Community. The Travellers might be able to deceive them, creating false intelligence for them to discover but Solomei is no fool. He is likely to smell a rat unless the scheme the Travellers come up with is airtight. The key might be to appeal to the Brummacs instead. While they are highly educated scientists, their experience in spycraft leaves much to be desired. Ultimately, Solomei will follow their orders, so if the Travellers can create a ruse that seems too good to pass up and that requires the group to depart Zisduum Nagani, they might be able to get the Brummacs to break down the compound and suspend PRET therapy. The Brummacs have no intention of releasing their patients but in all the chaos, there might be opportunities to liberate them.

The other element that the Referee must keep in mind is the satellite uplink, described on page 27. For the first five days of operation, the satellite is collecting geographical data but for every day after that, the Referee should roll 2D. While the satellite never discovers the well-hidden Community, on a 9+ it does find the approximate location of the Community outpost in the Western Surge. This is the site from which the psions intend to extend the reach of the Clench, as described on page 23. After they discover the outpost, the Brummacs immediately order Solomei to break down the advanced bases and prepare for departure to the desert.

## LOADED FOR BEAR

After the Travellers learn that the Brummacs' goal is to find and raid the Community in the Adanian desert, they might want to upgrade the weapons and armor on the hover chariots. Some Travellers will be deterred by [[Adan]]'s relatively high Law Level, which outlaws the possession of all weapons except shotguns. In light of the fact that the Brummacs' mercenary soldiers are outwardly flouting those laws by arming their dune jumpers – albeit under the pretence of having an Imperial warrant – the Travellers might be compelled to seek out illegal weapons of their own.

An armed confrontation with the mercenaries is imminent and the Travellers are ill-equipped to fight in such a battle unless they upgrade their vehicles. The scenario described in Showdown on page 37 provides examples of ways that the Travellers can fight without weapons but their chances of success are drastically reduced. They would be forced to fight a battle of attrition using hit-and-run tactics. With their superior knowledge of the Adanian desert, they would have tricks up their sleeves – not to mention a cadre of psions on their side – but ultimately the mercenaries' superior weaponry is likely to win the day. If the Travellers do not seek better weapons and armor on their own, the Referee might suggest doing so with an in-game plot device. Colport might know that there are illegal gun runners at [[Adan]] Downport. Alternatively, the Referee might have Visandra Palmore make an appearance (see page 45). Palmore is a Chanestin smuggler who has access to many illegal cargoes, including an array of weapons that the Travellers could use to upgrade their hover chariots. Palmore hates the Imperium and would be more than happy to broker a deal with the Travellers that flouts the ambitions of the Brummacs.

If the Travellers seek out weapons, have them make a Streetwise check. Arms dealers are virtually impossible to find in [[#Zisduum Naganiz]], so if they attempt the search there, this is a Very Difficult (12+) Streetwise check (INT or SOC, 2D hours). Success indicates that they somehow manage to find the rare dealer who has made the journey from the downport to the capital. Failure means they do not; however, a failure with Effect -1 to -4 informs the Travellers that they would be better off going to the downport to find who they are looking for. Effect -5 or lower tips off the local police, whom the Travellers must then evade. At the Downport, it becomes easier to find a smuggler, reducing the effort to a Difficult (10+) Streetwise check (INT or SOC, 2D hours). Success results in either a direct meeting with Palmore or a middleman who then arranges a meeting with the Chanestin smuggler. Palmore is a cautious dealer –one does not defy the Imperium in the Core and stay out of trouble without being careful – and investigates the Travellers before meeting with them. After she has determined the legitimacy of their efforts, she contacts them through an intermediary to set up a meeting at a hole-in-the-wall bar on the outskirts of the startown.

Palmore is attended by her first officer, a bruiser by the name of Peete Vaskin. Peete does not say much during the encounter, preferring to hover over his captain and look menacing. Ideally, Palmore will want to look at the hover chariots to see what can be done. After making a brief inspection, she tells them that if they remove the auxiliary batteries, the addition of a mounted weapon and gun shield should provide them with the firepower that they need. This drastically reduces the Range of the vehicle from 730 (1,095) to 400 (600). Alternatively, they could dismantle the passenger station, converting a hover chariot into a one-person vehicle; however, this reduces their effectiveness in battle since the elevated passenger position is beneficial for spotting sinkholes and other hazards. This would also require the driver to operate the weaponry, reducing nimbleness and versatility in battle. The hover chariots are simply not designed for this type of engagement and sacrifices must be made to convert them into effective combat vehicles.

After removing the auxiliary batteries or passenger station, the hover chariots have one open Space, which can be used to add a pintle mount and weapon. If a gun shield is added, armor Protection becomes +6 against all attacks originating from the fire arc the mount is currently facing. In battle with the dune jumpers, this means whenever the Travellers and their Community cohorts win a dogfight, they can use their armored facing, giving them Protection +6. However, should they lose a dogfight, their opponents get to select the facing, presumably one of the hover chariots' poorly armored flanks, which give them only Protection +1. Note that if Colport is involved in the plan, he informs them that in addition to the 10 hover chariots at Zisduum Nagani, the Community have an additional 10.

Palmore has several leads to follow and requires the Travellers' help to do it in a timely fashion. Have the Travellers make an Average (8+) Streetwise check (INT or SOC, D3 days) to reach out to the individuals on her contact list. The Referee may abstract this activity or play it out, including false leads, close run-ins with law enforcement and other events. The Effect of the checks determines what they find.

In addition to the above, Travellers who served in the army or marines, and who successfully make the Streetwise check, may replace the ammunition found with AP or HE rounds, as described in the [[Central Supply Catalog#HIGH EXPLOSIVE ARMOR PIERCING (HEAP)]]. Consider it 'warriors' privilege' that the dealers are willing to sell to Travellers with the necessary experience and only them. It is one thing to put dangerous automatic weapons into the hands of novices but quite another to give them ammunition that they might inadvertently kill themselves with.

Note that each of these contacts will only make a deal if Palmore is involved. Palmore is well connected with [[Adan]]'s underworld and its denizens refuse to make alternative arrangements behind her back. There might be no honor among thieves but apparently there is among illegal arms dealers. Palmore can broker a deal to sell these items to them at D3+1 x standard cost – thwarting Adanian laws does not come cheap. If Colport is involved in the negotiations, he might balk at the high prices. Regardless, he has only enough discretionary cash to purchase Cr200000 worth of equipment. The Travellers may attempt to barter with Palmore further, appealing to her good will or hatred of the Imperium. Allow them to make a Difficult (10+) Persuade check (INT or SOC) to do so but ultimately, she cannot sell them the goods at less than 1.5x their standard prices without taking a loss, which she is unwilling to do.

Palmore can acquire help to install the purchased equipment for an additional 5% of the total purchase cost. Alternatively, the Travellers can do the job themselves provided they have the Mechanic skill. As for transportation, Palmore can have the equipment delivered to Zisduum Nagani at no additional charge but, if time is an issue, she can arrange to have it air dropped at or near the Community outpost via a tilt-rotor aircraft owned by Kady Irmibu, a local bramblewine smuggler (see page 46). Colport and the Travellers might be leery about giving Palmore and Irmibu the coordinates of the outpost and perhaps rightly so. The psions have survived by carefully concealing their location and slowly cultivating a relationship with the ACA. The thought of divulging their location to smugglers may not seem to be the brightest idea but desperate times might call for desperate measures.

Captain Irmibu's tilt-rotor aeroplane has enough cargo space to transport all 10 of Colport's hover chariots and up to 20 sets of weapons and gun shields with enough extra space to squeeze in a few passengers. The range of the plane can take it relatively close to the western extents of the Clench before it must turn tail and head back home. Its range can be extended by slowing down to cruising speed or making arrangements for a fuel truck to meet them somewhere along the periphery of the Clench. The Travellers must make decisions about how fast and how far they need the plane to carry them. There will be numerous factors to consider including whether the Brummacs have already departed for the region in their helicopter and whether or not they intend to reach the outpost in time to arm the other 10 hover chariots. Allow them to view the [[Adan]] world map to help them devise a plan.

Aeroplanes of this class are designed to deliver cargo to distant locales with rough terrain and no airfields, tilt rotors enabling the plane to set down on just about any reasonably solid surface. Fuel-efficient engines give the plane considerable range, enabling long round trips (even longer if fuel is present at its destination).
This variant of the class, with camouflage and stealth features, is used during wartime on mid-tech worlds. Kadma 'Kady' Urmibi, the current captain of the Sirocco, uses it to smuggle high-value produce from the Clench to buyers at [[Adan]] Downport.

# DEEP DESERT

Time is of the essence on the journey back into the western desert. Whether the Travellers drive hover chariots or use the _Sirocco_ , they must make haste or risk arriving too late to save the Community outpost from the Brummacs and their mercenaries. By this point in the adventure, weeks have passed and Numin is coming to a close. The long night of Turashu is approaching and the Clench will soon disperse its last pollens of the season as its tendrils, vines and cordons begin to contract, dissipate and decompose.

If the Travellers are able to get to the Western Surge in time to confront the mercenaries, the battle will likely occur as [[Adan]]'s binary pair are beginning to set in the western sky. Of course, an Adanian sunset takes several standard days to pass but time is running out nonetheless. If an accurate timeline is desired, the Referee should determine when the Brummacs and mercenaries acquired the approximate location of the Community and therefore when they begin their journey to the western extents of the Clench. Having interrogated Colport and one or more captured psions, they have acquired two objectives: stop the Community from extending the reach of the Clench and assault the Community outpost, seeking to capture as many of its members as possible for induction into the PRET program. Having dual objectives causes the Brummacs to divide their forces.

The return trip to the western desert may be as detailed or abstracted as the Referee and Travellers desire. Adding some detail to the journey, perhaps reprising encounters with some of the people and phenomena encountered on their initial trip might add tension and immersion to the adventure. The Travellers know they need to get to the extents quickly but there are obstacles in their path and events that might waylay them in one way or another.

As the Travellers reach the Western Surge, they are met by 10 hover chariot-mounted members of the Community, led by Taniin who introduces them to her fellow psions. If the Travellers have brought weaponry and armor to install on the Community hover chariots, Taniin takes them to the outpost, where an additional 20 individuals – some from the Community and some from the ACA – are preparing for their mission to the Clench.

If the mercenaries have arrived at the Clench extents, then the Community hover chariot scouts have detected their presence and the scientists have retreated to the outpost. If they have yet to arrive, the science/psion team is making its way to the Clench, in order to guide its path towards the Western Surge. Depending on when the Brummacs and their mercenaries arrive, the science team could be caught in a dangerous situation and require help to retreat to the outpost. The Travellers will have to figure out a way to do this without exposing themselves to the dangers of the dune jumpers. If the Sirocco is still in the area, they might consider asking Urmibi to provide an emergency airlift.

After the Travellers, the Community, the Brummacs and Solomei's mercenaries are all present, the battle is joined.

# SHOWDOWN

The final showdown features the Travellers in a confrontation with the Brummacs and their mercenaries on the desert plains between the Clench and the mountains of the Western Surge. They are transported to the site by their helicopter, which returns to Zisduum Nagani after deploying the dune jumpers. The Brummacs have two objectives: to burn as much of the Clench as possible to prevent it from reaching the Surge, and to search the mountains for the Community outpost in order to destroy it. Initially, they have six dune jumpers assigned to burning the Clench and three making their way across the dunes towards the outpost but this division changes if the Travellers engage them in battle. The Referee should alter the number of vehicles deployed for each objective depending on how the conflict unfolds.

Each hex on the Showdown Map contains 65 hectares. Some hexes are completely filled with the Clench while others have only its extents, the reaching vines and tendrils making their way as far as they can into the desert. The mercenaries are primarily concerned with the extents. While they do not have a clear understanding of just what it is that the Community is trying to accomplish here, their interrogations of captured psions revealed that they are trying to extend the Clench's reach. Burning the extents will prevent the Community from achieving its goals. Using flamethrowers to destroy the extents is a long and laborious task but, if unopposed, the mercenaries can do considerable damage and successfully halt its growth. With a full magazine of fuel, each dune jumper can destroy one hectare per hour.

The helicopter sets down dozens of spare flamethrower fuel magazines for the dune jumpers to reload after they have been depleted. The mercenaries are aware how vulnerable the ammunition dump is and have camouflaged and placed light barriers around it for protection. If the Travellers find and destroy the ammo dump, Solomei's mercenaries are unable to complete one of their primary objectives. If the Travellers try to attack the ammo dump, Solomei assigns a dune jumper to defend it.

On the surface, the mercenaries appear to have a gross advantage over the Travellers and the Community. While the dune jumpers are hardly state-of-the-art military hardware, their armor and weaponry is superior to that of the hover chariots, especially if the Travellers have not upgraded their armament. However, the Travellers have several advantages in the battle that may not be readily apparent. The first of these are the flamethrowers carried by the dune jumpers. They enable the mercenaries to burn the Clench but are a liability in battle. Flamethrowers are dangerous weapons that pose a hazard not only to their victims but to the vehicles that mount them. If the outer shell of a dune jumper is penetrated and the tanks are breached, the results are explosive and may kill their drivers. Refer to page 124 of the Central Supply Catalogue for more information. If the Travellers manage to exploit this weakness, the mercenaries are forced to detach the fuel tanks and dump them in the desert, taking 1D rounds to do so. This prevents them from doing further damage to the Clench, but also enables them to focus on destroying the hover chariots and going after the Community with all their remaining forces.

![[CA3-1476395929.jpg]]
The hover chariots are less durable than the dune jumpers but are faster and more agile. The hover chariots have a maximum speed of High, enabling them to travel at up to 300 kilometers per hour. Meanwhile, the dune jumpers are Slow, limiting them to 100 kilometers per hour. With an advantage of two full speed bands, the hover chariots can close and open gaps with their opponents at will, as described in the Vehicles chapter of the Traveller Core Rulebook. However, the dune jumpers do have auxiliary thrusters, which enable them to periodically close that gap, as described on page 26.

The hover chariots might also use their considerable speed and agility advantages to get into a favorable firing position against the dune jumpers, which have heavy armor on their front surfaces (+16) and only light armor on the sides and rear (+4).

During their journeys along the Clench, the Travellers obtained yet another strategic advantage over their opponents: knowledge of the sinkholes. This is the mercenaries' first foray into the deep desert and they are unaware of its hazards. A crafty group of Travellers can use dogfights and stunts to lure mercenaries into concealed sinkholes. Using the dogfight rules, the drivers of both vehicles make opposed Drive checks, modified by their vehicles' Agility. Ideally, the Travellers must draw individual dune jumpers into one-on-one confrontations, because for every additional enemy in the dogfight, DM-1 is applied to the outnumbered side. The winner of the opposed check can attack their opponent while simultaneously staying out of their opponent's forward-facing arc. In addition, the winner gains DM+2 to all attack rolls for the current round while the loser suffers DM-2. If they win this check, the Travellers can attack as normal – if they have installed weapons – or use stunts to lure the dune jumpers into sinkholes by successfully executing a task chain.

The Traveller in the passenger seat of a hover chariot must first find a sinkhole in the desert terrain by making an Average (8+) Recon check (DEX or INT). After successfully spotting a sinkhole, they must goad an opposed dune jumper towards it. Then, they must make an Average (8+) Deception check (DEX) to lure the dune jumper towards the hazard. This check may be made by the driver or passenger. Success enables the driver to make a Difficult (10+) Drive (hovercraft) check
(DEX), also applying DM+2 from winning the dogfight; they only obtain the dogfight DM for this purpose if they forgo using their weapons during the round.

Unfortunately for both parties, the sinkholes are not the only hazard present. Large thunderhead clouds billow above the battle. A powerful electrical storm is brewing, which becomes a major factor during the battle. The Showdown map shows the starting locations of three thunderhead concentrations. During the battle, lightning begins to strike randomly throughout the region but the most dangerous concentrations of lightning activity are represented by the three thunderhead icons. The Referee should roll 1D for each thunderhead once every six rounds to determine which direction it moves, using the hex dial shown here.

If the result takes a thunderhead off the map, reroll the dice until the result indicates a direction that keeps it on the map. Any Travellers or characters caught in the same hex with a thunderhead might be struck by lightning. Roll 2D and if the result is 8+, every vehicle or individual in the hex suffers 6D damage from lightning strikes.

If the mercenaries manage to destroy 100 hectares of the Clench, not enough of it remains to extend its reach and the Community fails to achieve their goal. Ultimately, the Community could regroup and try again 44 standard days later during the following Numin –
if they survive the encounter with the mercenaries. However, the situation on [[Adan]] is getting increasingly desperate. The world faces imminent famine if the efforts of the psions, or some other creative solution, is not applied... and soon.

The mercenaries have limited resources and are not on a suicide mission. If the Travellers and their Community allies manage to disable or destroy six of the nine dune jumpers, the remaining mercenaries retreat from the battle. The Brummacs are forced to recall their cargo helicopter and must accept that they are defeated.

# RESURGENCE

If the Travellers and their allies from the Community survive the battle in the desert and the mercenaries fail to destroy more than 100 hectares of the Clench, the psions will be able to continue their work. Their efforts reveal something wonderful and completely unexpected. Aided by the predictions of their clairvoyants, the manipulations of their telekinetics, the guidance of the botanical symbionts and, of course, the mind-linking talents of their telepaths, the Community enables the Clench to reach the edges of the Western Surge. Once there, the vines and tendrils harden and penetrate the regolith that covers hundreds of sinkholes, revealing dozens of aquifers just meters below the surface. The removal of the layers of loose rock liberates water, which bubbles to the surface, creating a dusty slurry that feeds the plant life of the Clench.

Only Travellers with knowledge of the biological or planetological sciences might immediately understand the portent of this event but Colport, ACA scientists and members of the Community are on hand to explain it to those who do not. The Clench is essentially a collection of hundreds of species of symbiotic plant life that works together to survive and prosper on [[Adan]]'s harsh surface. The scientists theorize that the Clench's writhing tendrils have been attempting to make their way to these aquifers for centuries, a blink of the eye in [[Adan]]'s geological history but a watershed event in the planet's relatively short period of human colonization. By reaching the planet's hidden water sources, the Clench not only ensures its own survival but gives itself the potential to grow much farther into the desert. Only time will tell what this means for [[Adan]] but the extension this far means a longer harvest during each Numin. At the very least, there should be no famine on [[Adan]] for the foreseeable future. At best, it could mean that [[Adan]] has entire oceans underground, just waiting to be discovered and brought to the surface. Additional studies will be necessary but if the Adanians and their allies in the Community can continue to learn how to manipulate the Clench, they might be able to free trillions of litres of water, possibly even creating a measurable change to [[Adan]]'s hydrographic percentage.

The long-term implications are almost completely unknown but the release of the water seems to have been the goal of the Clench all along. As far as anyone can tell, the event bodes well for the future of life on [[Adan]] and might very well expand its outward reach from the Cleft. Some of the species of the Clench might relocate to a second 'Cleft' if enough water can be liberated. Located thousands of kilometers from their traditional habitat, where they have evolved for millions of years, they might create a similar ecosphere or a completely new one, depending on subtle differences in climate.

Whatever the case may be, Adanians can look forward to a future in which life is not limited to the coasts of the Cleft and the temporal edges of the Eastern and Western Clenches. The people of [[Adan]] have found ways to acclimate and survive in a challenging environment but their existence has largely been in sync with the ecosphere of their world. Careful cultivation of that environment will enable them to continue to do so but there is the danger that their eagerness to inhabit and exploit these new oases could have negative effects on the ability of [[Adan]]'s life forms to grow naturally and sustainably. The Travellers will just have to come back some day to see how things are going.

# NEW PSIONIC TALENTS

The following are a few rare psionic talents. While each of these talents is used by characters in the adventure, the Referee may optionally allow psionic Travellers to learn them as well. Each of these talents has a learning DM-2 as described in the Psionics chapter of the _Traveller Core Rulebook_.

## BOTANICAL SYMBIOSIS

Botanical symbiosis enables a psion to interact with and control plant life.

### Plant Life Detection

The most basic talent of botanical symbiosis is the ability to detect the presence of nearby plant life. Using this ability enables the psion to determine the number or amount of plants in the vicinity.

**Check** : Easy (4+) Botanical Symbiosis check (1D x 10 seconds, PSI)
**Reach** : Distant
**PSI Cost** : 1

### Camouflage

This power enables the psion to blend in with various forms of plant life, either by temporarily changing pigment and temperature to match that of ambient plant life or by causing the plants to subtly move, providing protection and cover. A successful check reduces detection attempts against the psion by DM-4 and increases their effective Protection by +D3. This power affects detection in the visible, infrared and ultraviolet spectrums.

**Check** : Routine (6+) Botanical Symbiosis check (1D x 10 seconds, PSI)
**Reach** : Short
**PSI Cost** : 3

Entangle Provided that the affected plant life has vines, tendrils or other malleable appendages and is within short range of its target, the psion may use it to entangle 1D opponents. Individuals may resist entanglement by making an opposed Athletics (strength or dexterity) check. Entanglement lasts for a number of rounds equal to 2D x the Effect of the check. Entangled persons may still make non-movement-oriented actions, provided they make a Difficult (10+) Melee (unarmed) check (STR or DEX) to free their heads and hands.

Check : Average (8+) Botanical Symbiosis check (1D seconds, PSI)
Reach : Short PSI Cost : 5

## CHANGELING

The changeling talent enables a psion to impersonate other beings of similar size and physique.

### Vocal Impersonation

Enables the psion to accurately imitate the voice of another sophont for 1D minutes. The psion must have heard the voice of the impersonated individual at least once to effectively use the power.

Check : Routine (6+) Changeling check (PSI)
Reach : —
PSI Cost : 2

### Facial Metamorphosis

Enables the psion to alter their facial appearance for 2D minutes times the Effect of the check. The altered facial appearance may be that of another individual by increasing the Difficulty to Average (8+). The psion must have seen the impersonated individual on at least one occasion to do this.

Check : Routine (6+) Changeling check (1D x 10 minutes, PSI)
Reach : —
PSI Cost : 4

### Full-Body Metamorphosis

Enables the psion to change their complete outward appearance for 1D hours times the Effect of the check. The altered appearance may be that of another individual by increasing the Difficulty to Very Difficult
(12+). The psion must make physical contact with the impersonated individual on at least one occasion to use this power.

Check : Difficult (10+) Changeling check (1D hours, PSI)
Reach : —
PSI Cost : 8
![[CA3-1476395932.jpg|200]]

## COUNTERPSIONICS

A counter-psion can discover, inhibit and block the abilities of other psions.

### Psionic Detection

Enables the counter-psion to detect the presence of other psions within the listed Reach. Success with Effect 2+ informs the counter-psion of the talents of 1D detected psions. Success with Effect 4+ increases that number to 2D psions.

**Check** : Routine (6+) Counterpsionics check (1D x 10 seconds, PSI)
**Reach** : Distant
**PSI Cost** : 1

### Focused Block

Enables the counter-psion to block an opposed psion from using a talent for a number of minutes equal to 2D- the Effect of the check.

**Check** : Average (8+) Counterpsionics check (1D seconds, PSI)
**Reach** : Medium
**PSI Cost** : 1 + the PSI cost of the talent used by the opposed psion

### General Block

Enables the counter-psion to block the use of all psionics by a single psion for a number of minutes equal to 2D + the Effect of the check.

Check : Difficult (10+) Counterpsionics check (1D seconds, PSI)
Reach : Medium PSI Cost : 2 + the highest PSI cost of the opposed psion's talents, limited by the available PSI points of the counter-psion

### Anti-Psionic Field

Enables the counter-psion to block the use of all psionics usage in a sphere of variable size for a number of minutes equal to 1D + the Effect of the check. Success with Effect 0 creates a Reach: Short field, success with Effect 2+ creates a Reach: Medium field and success with Effect 4+ creates a Reach: Long field.

Check : Difficult (10+) Counterpsionics check (1D seconds, PSI)
Reach : Varies PSI Cost : 6

### Deflect

Enables the counter-psion to deflect a psionic ability that is used against them. Success with no Effect blocks and nullifies the use of psionics against the counter-psion. Success with Effect 3+ enables the counter-psion to redirect the ability or attack against another individual, including the psion who used the ability.

Check : Difficult (10+) Counterpsionics check (PSI)
Reach : Short PSI Cost : 4

# ALLIES AND OPPOSITION

## NESIN COLPORT

Colport is a mid-level administrator in the ACA, [[Adan]]'s primary government agency. He is fastidious and a little nervous. He knows that he is going to need offworld help and is relying upon the Travellers to provide it. He wants to trust them but as an advocate for the Community, he is concerned about their stance on psionics. If they show that they are tolerant, he eases up and learns to trust them more. Colport is Salassim's partner.

Salassim has a rare psionic talent: Botanical Symbiosis, which allows him to interact with plant life. He has taken the lead on a joint Community/ACA project to analyse the Clench extents. Salassim is Colport's partner.
