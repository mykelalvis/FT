# The Dunmag Sargasso

An area within the [[Dunmag Subsector]] (hex 1816) is designated as a sargasso; a region that blocks jump travel or makes it more hazardous. The Dunmag Sargasso is not hazardous compared to similar phenomena elsewhere but it still traps the occasional starship.

The Dunmag Sargasso is thought to have been created when two rogue gas giants collided in deep space, strewing low-density gas throughout the surrounding region. The gas cloud is just dense enough to interfere with jump operations, although most ships pass by with no harm or experience only mild effects such as slightly longer jump times, rough emergence or greater variance in the emergence point, such that the ship may need to make a transit in normal space of a day or two rather than arriving directly at the target world.

However, the Dunmag Sargasso is said to have trapped hundreds of starships over the centuries. There is little scientific data available but spacers bar-room tales speak of lost Imperial and alien ships, including species never seen elsewhere in Charted Space. The speaker usually knows someone who met a crewmember of a ship that got stuck and made an incredible escape but could not bring anything back to prove the story. Details of how the ship got out of the sargasso and reached an inhabited system are usually rather vague.

## Jumping Through the Sargasso

Any vessel charting a course through the Dunmag Sargasso suffers DM-1D to the crew's Engineering and Astrogation (determine separately for each) checks to jump. The cumulative Effect of these checks is used to determine if something untoward has occurred.

|    Effect    | Result          |
| :----------: | --------------- |
| -10 or lower | Trapped         |
|   -9 to -6   | Major Variance  |
|   -6 to -3   | Minor Variance  |
|    -2 to 0   | Slight Variance |
|      1+      | No Variance     |

Variance indicates an increase in jump duration and emergence position:
Slight: Jump duration is increased by 2D-2 hours; this is often too small to be noticed. Emergence position will be off by 2Dx10 diameters.
Minor: Duration is increased by 4D hours.
Emergence is off by 2Dx100 diameters.
Major: Duration is increased by 2D-1 days.
Emergence is off by 2Dx1,000 diameters

A ship that suffers a Trapped result emerges from jump within the Sargasso gas cloud after a normal jump duration. Escape may depend upon finding some suitable source of fuel, perhaps scavenged from a less fortunate vessel.
