# CRONOR

The Cronor system is the regional capital for the [[Zhodani Consulate]] in the [[Spinward Marches]]. As such, it is heavily protected by both in-system (non-jump capable) and conventional naval assets, as well as ground forces.  A large detachment of what Imperials refer to as the Consular Guard protects governmental installations and stands ready to fight large-scale battles.

Express courier routes known as postal routes come from deeper in the Consulate (via [[Errere]]) and are then staged onward into the [[Querion subsector]] via [[Atsa]], and [[Jewell Subsector|Jewell]] via [[Cipango]]. A minor spur runs coreward to the naval base at [[Gesentown]].

The Consulate does not have a separate Scout Service like the Imperium, so operation of the postal routes and similar communications duties are undertaken by naval vessels. These are lightly armed but fast couriers operating out of a dedicated section of the Cronor naval base.

The Zhodani navy also undertakes a range of scientific and exploration missions, and vessels of this type also operate out of Cronor. Some function as intelligence-gathering assets along the frontier but most are genuine scientific vessels. Although lightly armed and part of the navy, these are not combat assets and are no match for a warship of comparable size.

Cronor Naval Base is located on one of Cronor's moons and is very extensive. Not only does it have formidable fortifications for its own defence, there are numerous long-range missile batteries on the surface for the defence of the planet proper. Civilian access to the base and associated moon is entirely prohibited.

Most visitors to Cronor are impressed, even staggered, by the size and quality of the highport. Located in orbit above Cronor, the highport receives all traffic from outside the Consulate and most from within. Access to the planetary surface is by a shuttle service operated from the port. Zhodani-registered vessels can obtain permission to proceed directly to the downport if necessary, however foreign ships cannot.

The highport is a city in space, with residential areas, parks, industrial zones and a full range of facilities for those who live and work there, as well as visitors. Clean, efficient and friendly, Cronor Highport is a showcase for the Consulate and creates a good first impression. In fact, the highport is all most visitors see of the world.  Travel to the surface is subtly discouraged and largely unnecessary, given that everything a Traveller could want is found in orbit.

Cronor itself is an average-sized world with a very thin atmosphere and plenty of water. Unassisted humans cannot function on the surface, although all that is needed is an air supply or compressor mask. Most of the populace do not venture outside the huge, sealed cities where they dwell. These are connected by maglev rail links and fast speeders.

The cities are self-contained arcologies, with millions or tens of millions living in each. There are some smaller settlements but most have specialist functions. Places where the bulk of the population live and work tend to be large for efficiency and social reasons.

The cities are all slightly different but each is a thoroughly pleasant place to be. As at the highport, there are parks and recreation facilities for public use and the streets are both clean and almost entirely free of crime. Law Level is moderately low by Imperial standards and to an outsider there seems to be little in the way of enforcement; rather than policing an unruly population, the Zhodani prefer to solve the problems that lead to crime and unhappiness, making 'fire brigade' style enforcement less necessary.

The people themselves are, for the most part, not merely contented but enthusiastic about what they do for a living or recreation. Rampant materialism is uncommon; there is an underlying philosophy of 'don't show me what you have, tell me what you've done' among the proles and intendants of the Consulate. Personal achievements count for more than things bought with money.

With a population numbering in the billions, Cronor has a huge and powerful economy that produces high-technology goods for export as well as domestic use. Some even find their way into Imperial markets, although this is not common. Government takes the normal Zhodani form of officials elected from among, and by, nobles; not really democratic as the franchised class is so small, but nor is it quite the same thing as direct oligarchical rule.

Outside the cities much of Cronor's surface is uninhabited. The population is more concentrated than\
on many Imperial worlds and this leaves considerable wilderness between settlements. There is a fair amount of plant life in the wilderness but few higher creatures due to the thin air.
