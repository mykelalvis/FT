Tertha ([[Core Subsector|Core]] 2020, C200342-B) has only a few thousand permanent residents, most of whom manage its pedestrian starport, which primarily serves as a jump-3 conduit for traffic between  [[Capital]] and the [[Anther]] Cluster. There are no planets or gas giant moons larger than 3,500km in diameter insystem. Geological studies indicate that there were once fewer and larger planets in the system but collisions broke them up into smaller worlds. Tertha's broad asteroid belt is primarily located one orbit outside the habitable zone but rogue asteroids enshroud the system from near-orbit of its primary star out to a distance of about 7AU, making collisions common.

While most of the asteroids in the belt have been claimed and developed during thousands of years of exploitation, there remain enough resources for a small community of independent belters to continue operating in-system at a profit. During its heyday, the belt hosted a thriving population, many of whom lived in asteroids that were hollowed out after the bulk of their metals and minerals were extracted. Most of these are now abandoned, left adrift for centuries and long ago stripped of valuable items by salvage teams. The Imperial Navy tracks most of these in order to prevent pirates, terrorists and other troublemakers from establishing bases in them. One such asteroid has been purchased and redeveloped by the eccentric [[Countess Tranard]], a reclusive noble who administers her fief – located eight parsecs to spinward – in absentia. She calls her asteroid home [[#Renegade Roost]]. Only her most-trusted staff members have much of a clue about what she does in her lonely space rock but even they are only allowed limited access to its interior.

# PLACES OF INTEREST

## Renegade Roost

[[Countess Tranard]]'s 30,000-ton private asteroid is highly unusual. She has gone to extensive lengths to make it difficult to find. Its TL8 fusion power plant has been shut down for years. After such a long time without maintenance, it is doubtful that it can even be fired up without a team of qualified engineers to troubleshoot the problems that would doubtless arise. Instead, [[#Renegade Roost]] uses an array of retractable solar panels, which charge a fleet of high-efficiency batteries to provide power for its minimalist needs.

The majority of the interior is filled with a biosphere, a cultivated garden of alien plants that the countess has collected over the course of her life. The Roost has no artificial gravity, instead relying upon spin to produce a reasonably comfortable 0.6G on the floors of its central capsule. Walking within the immense biosphere, some might find it disorienting to look up at a 'sky' that is simply more jungle. A complex irrigation system keeps the habitat and its flora appropriately watered. Since the habitat relies on spin and not artificial gravity, its central space – about 25 meters from the jungle floor – is in zero-G.

With no locomotion of its own, [[#Renegade Roost]] relies upon Sherman , a 5,000-ton drone tug, which attaches to the asteroid's Type-V docking clamp and drags it wherever the countess wants to go. Sherman is housed in a private berth at the starport on Tertha when not in use.

When the countess decides she wants privacy, it is extremely difficult to find her. She often has Sherman drag the Roost to a new orbit around [[Tertha]]'s primary star without informing her staff. She has built an array of radio repeaters on much smaller asteroids throughout the system, to which she makes tightbeam transmissions with requests to her employees, who are housed on Tertha when not stationed at the Roost. By using repeaters, she prevents anyone, friend or enemy alike, from easily tracking her movements. When she desires company or simply wants to manage her affairs, she broadcasts her current location to her staff and beckons them to the station. The staff are at the countess' beck and call, and have access to a pinnace to respond to her summons. At the time of the Travellers' arrival, the staff are on Tertha and the countess' whereabouts are unknown.

### Shadow Security Robot

![[CA2-50_1476396028.jpg]]
The Shadow Security Robot is designed to patrol exterior installations, using multi-chromatic and multi-sensory camouflage to blend into any environment from vacuum plains to thick jungle. Equipped with advanced sensors, gecko grippers and a self-repairing chassis, the Shadow is designed for survivability and usually gets off the first shot with its integral chest-mounted laser rifle. If necessary, it can close range and engage with its sharpened manipulators.

The shadow is highly intelligent, able to plan ambushes and smart enough to retreat and strike later if the odds are against it, notifying its masters of intruders and tracking them undetected. Its camouflage and stealth characteristics grant DM-4 versus visual detection and DM-3 versus electronic, auditory and olfactory detection devices.
