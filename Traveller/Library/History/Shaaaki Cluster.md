# The Shaaaki Cluster

The trailing [[Sylean Main]] has a long and complex history. At the advent of the Third Imperium, the dominant industrial power of the region was a world called Shaaak (pronounced 'sha-yawk'). Although only one parsec from Sylea (now Capital), Shaaak was never a member of the [[Sylean Federation]], the predecessor of the Third Imperium. The Shaaaki are the product of a hybrid Vilani-Solomani culture that flourished during the Rule of Man and whose citizens saw themselves as a distinct ethnic group. Many of their descendants still do. The Shaaaki persevered through the Long Night, maintaining civilization and retaining a semblance of their former industrial might; however, they were limited to just their own star system until being contacted by Sylean scouts. The acquisition of technology from the Syleans and access to their growing interstellar empire enabled Shaaak to revive its fortunes. If industrial might were the only factor needed to found an empire, Shaaak might have had a brighter future than Sylea itself. Alas, Shaaak's leaders did not have the vision of Cleon Zhunastu to create a new and mighty 'Grand Empire of the Stars'. Shaaak maintained its independence until joining the Third Imperium became inevitable, shortly after its establishment.

A mere two centuries into the Imperial era, Shaaak's environment had become severely degraded by unbridled industry, resulting in mass extinctions of native life forms and the declining health of its people. With the imminent environmental collapse of a world right on  [[Capital]]'s doorstep, Emperor Martin II deindustrialised the planet and ordered a mass emigration of the Shaaaki people to several nearby worlds: Ase, Uunli (now Umgadin) and Khishnar (now Xalm). A smaller colony of Shaaaki settled on Vlaakier, which later became Affinity. Shaaak itself was renamed Syroe and put into conservatorship so Imperial ecologists could revive the world's ailing environment. In modern times, Syroe is an independent world and does not associate itself with the Shaaaki Cluster.

Undeterred by the disaster wrought upon their homeworld, the Shaaaki tenaciously industrialised their adopted worlds. [[Ase]] became the dominant force of the cluster, with Umgadin relegated to a supporting role. Xalm showed similar promise but suffered financial, political and ecological crises in the late 900s from which it has never recovered. Affinity developed a cosmopolitan culture and did not become an official member of the Shaaaki Cluster – at least not initially – although its importance as a trade hub grew over time. In spite of the challenges they have faced, [[Ase]] hopes to lead the Shaaaki Cluster into a bright future with a blend of authoritarian politics and industrial drive.

There are headwinds that prevent [[Ase]] from ascending into the ranks of the great industrial powers of the sector. Firstly, they face stiff competition. Within the Sylean Worlds cultural zone, Shudusham and Khuir have become truly elite industrial worlds. Fuelled by the business acumen of the Sylean people, these worlds dominate not only the coreward portion of the sector but delve into the neighboring Lishun and Fornast sectors as well. To spinward are Shibashliim and Keplo, which have a chokehold on the so-called 'Old Confederacy', the long string of worlds that once comprised the Interstellar Confederacy. There are opportunities to rimward and trailing but there are difficulties to overcome in both directions. The Chant subsector has a depressed economy and has been resistant to economic revival efforts while Dingtra offers a rich market, however its culture of economic isolationism makes it a difficult region to penetrate.

Perhaps the greatest challenge faced by [[Ase]] and the Shaaaki people is not economic but biological. The industrial pollution propagated by their ancestors has affected Shaaaki genetics. They suffer from low birth rates and endemic health problems. Much of this can be overcome by modern medicine, however access is limited to the financial elite. To rise into the ranks of the top Imperial worlds, one must have an immense population to support growth and the Shaaaki seem incapable of generating one.

## Political Factions

The [[Third Imperium]] is a feudal monarchy with both its head of state and deliberative body based on  [[Capital]]. The Imperium is a vast union of independent worlds, held together by the guarantee of free trade and the power of its navy. Individual worlds are left to govern themselves with little interference from the Imperium, provided they do not break Imperial laws.

In spite of the seeming implacability of the Emperor and ruling nobility, there are numerous political factions present, which engage in lively debate about how the empire and its worlds should be governed. Over the centuries, these factions have come to be identified by colours. For example, the centrists are known as the Orange faction or more colloquially, the 'Orangists'. While virtually all the known factions are represented on Capital, those that dominate the [[Shaaaki Cluster]] are as follows:

- [[Ase]]– The Asei are members of the Gold (plutocratic) and Zircon (authoritarian) factions. The Asei people bow to the will of a cabal of rich industrialists who believe in the need for strong governmental institutions to shepherd the masses.
- [[Umgadin]] – The Umgadini are the most liberal of the Shaaaki systems. Their parliamentary republic has many factions but the two most dominant are the Orange (centrist) and Sparkle (traditionalist) factions.
- [[Xalm]] – Xalm is in the throes of decline. While their president is a right-of-center Orangist, the Aglow Greens (socialist environmentalists) are gaining traction and threatening to overthrow the government. [[Ase]] does not intend to allow this to happen and has dispatched a division of ground troops and military advisors to assist the current regime against insurgency.
- [[Affinity]] – Affinity has a captive government and is dominated by [[Ase]] but most of its citizens do not see eye-to-eye with the Asei. Affinity has a mishmash of factions but the most prevalent are the White (anarchist) faction.

## DIRTY LITTLE SECRETS

In interstellar societies, innovation and industrialization are the rising tides that lift all boats. To some extent, the 'Promethean fire' of technology is shared amongst the corporations and megacorporations. Many technological solutions are open source; their patents are made available for all to use and modify. Others are rigorously protected, their designs stored in secure data systems, prototypes locked away in cryptically sealed vaults. To some extent, this covetousness prevents valuable technologies from proliferating as well as they might, which ultimately hurts consumers but also creates competition. Competing Imperial corporations are driven to find new and innovative solutions to problems in order to serve their vast customer bases.

Many of the Imperium's industrial worlds are hubs of innovation. However, not all industrial worlds come by their output honestly. [[Ase]] is Tech Level 14, a mere point away from the nominal maximum of the Imperium. The cities of [[Ase]] include some hubs of innovation but the dirty little secret of the Asei is that they steal a good portion of their industrial and technological knowledge, most of it from the neighboring Syleans.

The Sylean Worlds are notoriously protective of their patents but they have a leak. The [[Sylean Syndicate]]s are pseudo-crime organizations found on most Sylean worlds and in Sylean communities throughout Imperial space, involved in many questionable activities. Among these are patent theft and technology counterfeit. The illegal acquisition of Sylean patents has enabled the Asei to artificially prop up their Tech Level.
