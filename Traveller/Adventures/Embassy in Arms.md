# EMBASSY IN ARMS

Location : [[Aramanx]] (B657974-7) [[Aramis subsector]], [[The Spinward Marches]]

This adventure is intended for a group of [[Vargr]] Travellers, probably in service to the [[Kforuzeng]] faction, although it can be adapted to other Travellers. The embassy of [[Lanax]], one of the many powers on Aramanx, is threatened with attack during civil unrest. Amid a volatile political situation the Travellers are tasked with evacuating and protecting the embassy staff and others sheltering there. Ideally, they are to avoid increasing tensions by refraining from violence, however this may not be possible.

> [!info] REFEREE'S INFORMATION
> [[Sternmetal Horizons]] LIC, an Imperial megacorporation, has been backing the expansion of Lovrenyi, one of the smaller but more heavily industrialised nations. Sternmetal has invested heavily in the nation and introduced a small but well-equipped mercenary contingent to supplement the Lovrenyi armed forces. Their long-term intention is to help Lovrenyi unify the planet into a single government, which would be heavily indebted to Sternmetal. The world could then be forced to accept terms favorable to the megacorporation's complete domination of the local economy. This plan, which has been in progress for some time, has proved ultimately unsuccessful. Lovrenyi extended its frontiers and coerced several nations into its sphere of influence, but became bogged down in a guerrilla war in one of their recent conquests. This gave other nations on Aramanx a chance to hire off-world mercenary forces of their own.

## THE SITUATION

The Republic of Lanax has obtained the services of a battalion of [[Vargr]] mercenaries, part of the [[Kforuzeng]] band. These mercenaries, equipped to TL10, have been employed in a number of strikes and border raids, and are the best military unit available to Lanax. Their presence is one of the reasons Lovrenyi has slowed its expansion and, until recently, seemed willing to negotiate with Lanax instead of invading.

Recently, tension between Lovrenyi and Lanax has increased, as a result of civil unrest in the former. Units in the service of the Republic recently crossed the Lovrenyi frontier and there has been a surge of anti-Lanaxian fervour among Lovrenyi's volatile citizenry. Riots have broken out in Lovrenyi's capital city, focused primarily on the Lanax embassy compound.

Forty citizens of the Republic, four Kforuzeng security specialists and a Kforuzeng Emissary have been cut off from the outside world by these rioters, who maintain what is essentially a state of siege. Whilst the Lovrenyi government officially deplores the situation, they are doing little to discourage the rioters beyond setting up roadblocks to limit the rioting to an area within a few blocks of the embassy compound.

The embassy guards are armed and prepared to resist attack but the political dimension is complex. Almost any move Lanax makes could trigger a conflict no one wants. Even sitting tight and waiting it out could be catastrophic; the general population of Lanax considers the situation to be humiliating. Demands for decisive action are increasingly loud and, in any case, doing nothing might be viewed as a sign of weakness that could harm the strategic situation.

The best solution seems to be an evacuation of the embassy compound but this must be carried off rapidly and without a major confrontation. Ideally, the government of Lanax wants to distance itself from the decision to retreat from its embassy by making it seem like the mercenaries undertook the evacuation on their own initiative.

The Kforuzeng mercenaries have a reason to go along with this plan. Five of their number are at the embassy and will be in extreme danger if it is attacked. Thus it has been arranged that the mercenaries will 'unilaterally' launch a rescue bid to bring their own people out and will, of course, collect the embassy staff at the same time. The government of Lanax will then condemn the reckless actions of the mercenaries in the same manner as Lovrenyi has condemned the rioters.

The operation must be carried out quickly, with no loss of life and a minimum of violence. The mercenaries are to enter Lovrenyi and reach the capital, secure the compound perimeter against possible interference from rioters or Lovrenyi troops, and bring the embassy staff out – and they must do it without starting a war.

## MERCENARY FORCES

The [[Kforuzeng]] force consists of 40 mercenaries supported by six g/carriers, each mounting a gauss cannon. The force is equipped to TL10 standards but fairly light in composition – it is an infantry formation intended to strike hard and fast against lower-tech opposition and then withdraw. Artillery, tanks and air support other than the g/carriers are not available.

A force of this sort tends to have a few non-combatant specialists available including lawyers and cyber-warfare experts. These might be helpful in some circumstances but the Tech Level of Aramanx is too low for much in the way of data warfare and legal arguments will not impress the rioters. This is very much a situation for decisive action carried out too fast for anyone to react.

## STAGING THE RESCUE

The capital of Lovrenyi is 270 kilometers from the border with Lanax. The trip can be made in an hour by g/carrier, although it would be advisable to take a more roundabout route to avoid flying over populated areas or air defence concentrations. The nations of Aramanx have very limited detection and tracking equipment; staying low and avoiding obvious trouble spots will generally suffice to remain undetected until the final approach to the capital.

The embassy compound is large enough to land two g/carriers at a time, without undue difficulty, and more could be crammed in with increased risk. The arrival of grav vehicles will be noticed sooner or later, but the Travellers might manage to delay detection long enough to get the evacuation going.

The mercenaries will be spotted on a straight check result of 8+ made every 10 minutes. This increases to 10+ if the landing is made at night. Once they are noticed, it will take some time for a response to emerge. At first this will be nothing more than a few curious civilians or individuals with an anti-Lanax disposition, who will probably do little more than throw the odd rock over the compound wall.

The response will escalate, especially once it becomes apparent the embassy is being reinforced or evacuated. Rioters will start trying to climb over the walls or to break open the gates, and grow in number. The Travellers might find themselves attempting to defend the compound with non-lethal methods or they may have to resort to using weapons.

The rescue is a violation of Lovrenyi sovereignty and will draw a response from local police, then the military. The Travellers need to be away before this happens, as open conflict with Lovrenyi troops in their own capital will almost certainly trigger the war they are trying to avoid.

If the embassy has been forewarned a rescue force is en route, it will take 2Dx5 minutes to load the vehicles. The process might be a great deal slower if the mercenaries neglected to inform the embassy they were coming and it is possible that someone might get left behind.

The last stages of embarkation are likely to be made under a hail of rocks, bottles and perhaps fire from whatever weapons the rioters have available. A determined but disorganised attempt will be made to storm the compound, which will draw in local troops if any have arrived but not yet engaged in hostilities – firing on the locals will require a response even if the troops are trying to de-escalate the situation.

It is also likely that the g/carriers will be pursued at least as far as the Lanax border. This does not necessarily mean fire will be exchanged – the situation might be a fraught high-speed standoff between local fighter pilots ordering the g/carriers to land and mercenaries offering spurious excuses not to, in the hope of delaying the first shots until they reach the border. If they can manage it without opening fire, the pursuers will break off rather than violate Lanax airspace, and the resulting diplomatic incident will stop short of open conflict. If, on the other hand, the Travellers blast their way in and out, war is virtually inevitable.
