### General Products

General Products is active in several market sectors, notably heavy industry and starship construction. The latter has suffered lately with a series of poor designs and embarrassing failures, a situation General is keen to reverse. To this end, it has taken to offering basic warships and trade vessels at low prices, resulting in an upsurge in small-scale trading – and occasionally an increase in piracy preying on the abundant shipping.  These vessels are not particularly good but provide an affordable patrol force to a cash-strapped client and can get goods from A to B almost as well as a more expensive ship. General Products does not have a center of power in Deneb but maintains shipbuilding facilities at several of the region's better starports.


General was formed by the merger of several manufacturing
concerns after the Civil War. It is primarily concerned with heavy
industry; notably the construction of starships and heavy machinery.
It also manufactures a range of 'general basics' such as tools and
kitchen implements which are adequate for their purpose and more
importantly, cheap.

General has dominated the cheap–and–good–enough end of
the market for many years, but has recently been at the center of
controversy as several of its starships have suffered serious defects.
Poor build quality and lack of attention to detail have been blamed
for the loss of several military and civilian starships, and General's
fortunes have declined accordingly. There are rumors that General
may shed its shipbuilding interests in some regions or may lose its
Navy contracts if it does not meet new tighter standards.
