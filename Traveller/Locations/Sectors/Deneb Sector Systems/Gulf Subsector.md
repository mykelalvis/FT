The Gulf is characterised by small clusters of star systems with easy jump-2 navigation across the subsector. It has no subsector duke and is generally thought of as a protectorate of Trin in the Spinward Marches. Unfortunately, Trin's interests extend only to the nearest worlds; the trailing parts of the subsector are largely ignored. Similarly, Vincennes exerts influence over the coreward-trailing worlds but gives little priority to the rest of the subsector.

This does not mean that Gulf is a dangerous frontier, of course. It is more accurate to describe it as an underdeveloped backwater where the influence of three duchies meet but none are particularly strong. This means that powerplays tend to be on a small scale and typically considered of low importance. Gulf is a place where other interests can come to the fore, at least locally, without being crushed by the subsector duke.

The Scout Service way station at Upuraku is something of an oddity. Way stations are intended to serve the x-boat network and Upuraku should have formed part of a link between Trin and Zeng. The route was never implemented however, leaving the Scout Service to find a use for an extremely expensive and well-equipped installation.

Way Station Upuraku supports the Trin end of the x-boat link, carrying out mid-life refits on x-boats and their tenders. These are rotated out of service for a more extensive overhaul than the routine maintenance conducted at other way stations. Similarly, an array of Scout Service craft are overhauled at Upuraku, including long-range exploration vessels and converted navy cruisers. Notable among these are Azhanti High Lightning-class cruisers transferred from the Imperial Navy for Scout Service use.

The way station is also a major training center, with Scout Service recruits receiving orientation and specialist training packages, and some personnel return later in their careers as instructors or to retrain for a new role. The installation's information-collation facility is one of the main intelligence hubs in the region behind the claw, receiving a steady stream of couriers and processing their raw data. Once analysed, reports are disseminated wherever needed - routine census and survey data goes into the public datanet and spreads across the sector but more sensitive information is made available only to the upper echelons of the naval command structure and subsector dukes.

High-jump couriers routinely leave Way Station Upuraku headed trailingwards, ultimately bound for [[Capital]]. It is no secret what data is carried aboard them – everything known at Upuraku at that moment – but what is contained within these data packets is highly classified.  Most are routine but occasionally a courier leaves with word of a war, rebellion or act of treason on the part of a major noble. It will be many months before a response reaches Gulf but the courier network ensures that one will most certainly come.
