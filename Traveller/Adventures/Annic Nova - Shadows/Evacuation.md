# Introduction

## Standards and Assumptions

The following standards and assumptions are used in the text of this adventure. The referee may alter them as necessary to correspond to the local situation.

### Dates

All dates herein correspond to the Imperial calendar. The date for this situation is assumed to be some time after the discovery of the [[Annic Nova]], which the original adventure assumed took place sometime in 1105. It is recommended that this follow up adventure takes place somewhere between 2-12 years after that date, depending on the needs of the campaign.

### Place

This adventure takes place in the [[Vargr Extents]], coreward of the [[The Spinward Marches]] in the [[Kaets]] system ([[Uthe]]/[[Gvurrdon]] 2338). [[Kaets]] is an unimportant world with a population in the millions which is concentrated in or near the starport. The starport is itself owned and operated by a [[Vargr]] [[Corsair]] cartel. The majority of the planetary surface has not been explored, though evidence of past landings and abandoned sort-term bases may be found in many locations. The nature of the systems government and the generally harsh environment has discouraged formal exploration.

The exact planet the characters start the adventure on is presented herein as [[Efate]]/[[Regina Subsector|Regina]] ([[The Spinward Marches]] 1705) but the referee can easily change this to suit the needs of his or her campaign.

It is recommended that the characters have and can crew a ship of some type, but it would be possible, if difficult, to accomplish the mission by hiring an NPC crew and vessel to provide transport.

## The Hook

The party are contacted by Professor Shakidesh Willis-Hashimoto at the University of [[Efate]] (or another Imperial world if that's easier for the referee to incorporate into his campaign). [[#Ellazkoudz|One of the Professor's students]] has been working on a Linguistics project, and has obtained a recording of a mysterious signal received in several systems starting in 1103. Records show that the signal came from an unusual derelict ship. It was established that the ship was operating under computer control and had jumped to several systems transmitting its message before finally being boarded in the [[Heya]] system.

After a bit of work puzzling over the recording, the student had a breakthrough; she did some pattern-matching on the letters marked on the ship's pinnaces and realized that the markings were numbers, not letters; further research led her to an obscure library data entry about a race of nomadic spacers in the Vargr Extents referred to by the Vargr as the **Dhoerrkaenfaek** who used the same markings on their ships. There is little information on this group in the library data other than that the Vargr consider them unimportant, and largely ignore them.

Further research led the student to a few recordings of the Dhoerrkaenfaek language, which she recognized as having loan words from a number of sources, including Vilani, Anglic and Gvegh. Following this realization she was able to finally translate the mysterious message:

> _"Signal GK, Signal GK - danger, disease present. Do not approach. We evacuate and seek refuge in the system called Kaets, in the subsector Uthe. Should we not survive, know that we rest in the embrace of the Great Void."_

The Professor has allocated some funding from her budget to pay for an expedition to [[Kaets]], to collect evidence supporting her students work. Her motivations are not completely altruistic of course; the work reflects well on the university, and she sees it as money well spent if it secures future grants and good publicity. She would also be delighted if the evacuees were to be found alive, though she confesses the story of the original crew is likely to have ended tragically. She will not be accompanying the expedition herself.

The characters may wish to discuss the findings with the student. [[#Ellazkoudz]] is excited to be the focus of all this excitement, but isn't especially keen to go on the expedition herself. If the characters are persuasive enough and the Referee wishes to provide the party with extensive linguistic capabilities, she could agree to the trip however. Her Professor will insist that she sign a waiver absolving her and the university of any responsibility however. As an aside, she will make it quite clear that if the characters allow her to come to any harm they will surely live to regret it.

# The Journey

**If the characters don't have their own ship:** Assuming [[Efate]] is the starting point of the expedition, the University will fund Mid passage tickets to [[Kinorb]], via [[Boughene]] and [[Pixie]]. Once at their destination, the players must find a ship which will take them over the border to [[Kaets]]. There will probably be a number of ships making the run along the jump main, though most Jump-1 ships will stop at [[Ghisaersae]] rather than risk the Corsair bands operating in the Ueghrrozue system. It's likely they can find a Jump-2 trader heading in the right direction without too much delay.

![[AN-Evac-016.jpg]]

**If they do have their own ship:** The University will pay for fuel and charter for the ship. Calculate this off the Jump capabilities of the ship and the consequent expected travel time from the starting system.

The characters themselves will be offered recompense the referee feels reasonable for his or her campaign. The University will pay no more than it has to; a little negotiation might get slightly better rates, but the characters will soon realize they aren't likely to get rich from this trip.

Nevertheless it should be an interesting charter which could lead to other, more profitable jobs in the future.

The referee is encouraged to spice up the journey to the [[Kaets]] systems with encounters. These might include interesting locals, cranky free traders and possibly a near encounter with Vargr pirates. The Referee could of course hand wave the details and state "several jumps later, you reach the [[Kaets]] system..." but making the journey interesting is always ultimately more satisfying.

## Map

A [[#^map|map]] of the area is also presented below. The marked Pinnace appears to have been here for some years, and has settled into the ground as well as being partly overgrown with vegetation. The power plant is still running however, and the characters will easily spot a thick cable which snakes through the undergrowth from the ship and over to the edge of the forest. A small group of buildings which appear to be made of wood covered with thick dried mud can be made out in the shelter of the trees. Unless the characters landed far away and managed to sneak up to the area, there will be nobody in sight.

The Pinnace air lock is locked, but a character with Electronics-2 should be able to get it open. On the sides of the Pinnace are weathered markings which appear to say:

> ![[AN-Evac-note.jpg]]

The stranded crew are wary of the local [[Vargr]] and will hide in the woodland near their village, observing the new arrivals. While lacking most modern equipment, they are ingenious; they’ve managed to manufacture efficient cold weather clothing, a system of compressors (powered by the Pinnace power plant) for their homes, and even compressor masks for themselves which operate from a manual pumping system. They've also rigged up a way to crack the water of the lake to refuel their vessel, and have kept the power plant running to provide power and heat.

The stranded crew are not violent by nature, but will defend themselves if attacked. They are hopeful of rescue, and if the camp is approached in a friendly fashion, one of them will come out from the trees to speak to the visitors. If threatened, they will attempt to withdraw into the forest, but if attacked will shoot back with their locally manufactured bows, and could even throw clay pots of burning pitch, which would cause problems even for someone wearing modern armor.

With access to fresh water, nearby marshland teaming with (mostly edible) wildlife and building materials from the forest, the stranded crew have managed to survive quite successfully, despite the challenges posed by the climate and thin atmosphere.

# The Survivors

The [[#Giiku mgash imgi|leader]] of the small tribe is a young woman. She is bundled up in cold weather clothing made of hides and most of her face is covered with a respirator mask. She also doesn’t speak Anglic, or indeed any other language the characters have probably heard. She doesn’t respond to the Vargr name for her people either (“Dhoerrkaenfaek[^trbl]”) because she hasn’t heard it before. The surviving adults in her little tribe never use the word because it’s actually mildly derogative; it means “Not worth the trouble”. If these initial challenges can be overcome the characters will be invited inside one of the buildings, which proves to be both warm and quite well pressurised due to the tribes cleverly rigged pumps. The rest of the tribe will gather inside with them and remove their masks.

If the characters have played the original [[Annic Nova]] adventure, they may recognize them as being members of the same humanoid race shown in an educational film that can be played in the [[Annic Nova#Quarters Deck (Locations 6 -19)|area 6]] of that ship. They are bald, eyebrow-less and have reddish skin. They are clearly a human race however. Fortunately, one of them, [[#Khyiim duudish dada|an older woman]] (who is actually the Medic who served aboard the Annic Nova) does speak heavily accented Vilani as well as halting Anglic. Another older adult is present (an engineer, responsible for the innovative tech that helped them survive on [[Kaets]]). He speaks Vilani and Gveck.

The [[#Giiku mgash imgi|young woman]] who first approached them was the half-trained pilot who managed to get the Annic Nova’s third pinnace away from the ship, navigate it across a system rife with Vargr pirates, avoid detection on their approach and land safely on Kaets. Her people consider her their leader, and though young, she takes her responsibility seriously.

The referee should role play the conversations. Some possible questions and answers:

> [!faq] Who are you?
> “We are the last of the crew of _Duukhumzi imgiu khimluukshaa_, of the [[Piishidam Kiishukuu]].”

> [!faq] How many of you are there?
> “There are only what you see here; we were three crew and four youngers when we abandoned the _Duukhumzi imgiu khimluukshaa_. Elsewhere, there are many of our people, living on ships which travel the Great Void.”

> [!faq] What happened to your ship?
> “There was sickness, which we believe was contracted during a trading mission. At first we believed it had run its course, but later it returned and we decided we must abandon _Duukhumzi imgiu khimluukshaa_ in order to have any chance to survive.”

> [!faq] Why didn’t you go to an occupied planet for help?
> “We would not wish to carry the sickness to others, for this would be a great shame to us and our people. If we could have reached our own people in time we would have obtained their help, but our ships range widely and we were unable to find one in time.”

> [!faq] Which world are you originally from?
> “Our ancestors were from Vland, but we left many generations ago. We have lived on other worlds in this region of the Great Void in the past, but now only live aboard ships.”

> [!faq] Why do you look different from other Vilani?
> “Our people once looked much like you. Over the thousands of years we have travelled our own path we have changed a little. Looks do not matter. It is what a sophont thinks and how it acts which is the true measure of it.”

Certainly, the little tribe would like to be rescued and taken back to their own people. They can suggest a few safer systems within the Extents which [[Piishidam Kiishukuu]] fleets are known to visit. They've also scouted the area around their forest during the years they've been here and know about the resources nearby. They get tar from deposits in the nearby swamp, and to the south-east they know of easily accessible deposits of mineable metals such as copper. These resources are marked on the area map, above.

Perhaps of interest to slightly more mercenary minded characters, they will promise (truthfully) that if helped to return to their people, their rescuers will be rewarded. This will turn out to be quite true; the [[Piishidam Kiishukuu]] will feel great obligation to those who came so far to rescue their lost people, and will not only gift them with as many trade goods as their ships hold can carry, but will treat them as friends and allies. The characters can always be assured of a welcome and of excellent deals in any future encounters, if they feel like making return trips to the area of space the [[Piishidam Kiishukuu]] call home.

# Complications

Getting the rescued crew members off world without being detected and attacked by the Vargr Corsairs should be achievable if the characters stick to the southern hemisphere and stay in the planetary sensor shadow. Once away from the world they will be more exposed and may be detected by an orbiting Vargr ship. They may be forced to pile on the speed in the hope they can reach 100 diameters and jump, or perhaps even fight.

They probably will need to refuel before they can leave. The chances of being attacked at the gas giant are high, but if they are sensible they will think to ask the [[Piishidam Kiishukuu]] engineer to connect his water-cracking setup to their ship, and to fill their tanks with hydrogen. This will take several days (referee’s choice on how long) which gives them plenty of time to get involved in other opportunities locally.

They may, if any of the players are inclined to, become involved with individuals of the small tribe. The Medic and the Engineer, as well as the tribal leader are of age. Since the [[Piishidam Kiishukuu]] do not marry within their own crew, none of them are in a relationship at the moment. Any of them may become enamored of the dashing heroes who rescued them. If the referee wants to have a little fun with this, one or more of the others might become jealous, leading to awkward situations everyone will have to navigate on the trip back.

The characters might want to explore [[Kaets]] a bit while they wait for their ship to refuel. The marshlands to the North-West are a miserable, uncomfortable place, but deposits of tar bubble to the surface there, indicating there may be valuable oil deposits below. To the South-East, the fractured landscape has exposed seams of copper. It’s fortunate that these are located away from the camp, as hazardous materials found in copper-bearing rock have the potential to leave a site through dust, rain, which can flow in washes and streams; and in the groundwater, which can contaminate local drinking water.

While copper is valuable, astute characters may know that copper is often found near deposits of other metals; these can include gold, silver, lead, zinc, iron, mercury, manganese, uranium, and tungsten. A serious mining operation would be required to locate and extract such riches, but if they take some samples away with them, they may be able to sell the information to a mining company who can operate in the [[Spinward Extents|Extents]].

In case the characters do decide to go exploring, some encounter tables are provided on the next page. While most of the local fauna is on the small size, there are some particularly big critters in more marshy areas, including a 18,000kg chaser the [[Piishidam Kiishukuu]] call a “[[#^11|Dathurtii]]”. It is best avoided.

# Encounters

Native life on [[Kaets]] is adapted to the cold, thin atmosphere, and can hibernate for long periods, usually emerging quite hungry. Many species can survive being frozen solid, recovering as they warm up. The native biology is generally compatible with human metabolism, though explorers should be aware of the potential for allergic reactions and a few poisonous plants.

The basic layout of native life is multi-legged (8 or 10) with segmented bodies and built low to the ground. High levels of light from the G0 IV sun have resulted in the development of eyes which are well protected from glare, with protruding structures shading the eyes from direct light.

# The Fate of _The Duukhumzi Imgiu Khimluukshaa_

The ship’s disastrous voyage began in [[Uthe]] Subsector, when the vessel visited [[Zoe]]/[[Uthe]] in search of a cargo of cheap goods to take back to their Fleet. The extended family making up the crew spend a few weeks negotiating with the Vargr who rule the world (see Secret of the Ancients pg. 181) and agreed to the deal while waiting for their ship capacitors to recharge. They then visited the starport in their cargo pinnace to collect the goods they had purchased, taking a short liberty on world while they were there.

While on world, members of the crew came into contact with some of the planet’s indigenous species, the [[Rynkatropa]]. Unlike the [[Rynkatropa]] living in the cities who are kept fed and disease free by their masters, these were “free” [[Rynkatropa]], seeking contact with outsiders who might be able to spread the word of their plight as a conquered people. One of the many challenges these people face are a number of epidemics which have reduced their numbers considerably. Unfortunately, the normally isolated [[Piishidam Kiishukuu]] would prove to be particularly vulnerable to one of these diseases; even short contact with the [[Rynkatropa]] was enough.

After concluding their business (and unknown to the Vargr, with a promise to their new contacts to spread the word about the plight of the [[Rynkatropa]]) the crew returned to their ship. They jumped soon after, heading for [[Triad]]/[[Uthe]] to do some more trading. While in jump space, several members of the crew became ill; by the time the ship emerged at [[Triad]], two had died. Two other crew members had become ill but seemed to be recovering.

The ship’s medic had deduced the source of the original infection must be related to their visit to [[Zoe]], and advised disposing of the cargo picked up there. Though it meant significant financial loss, the cargo was ejected, sent on a trajectory which would take it into the system’s sun. Suspecting that other humans might be susceptible to the contagion and not wanting to risk exposing others until they were certain the outbreak was truly under control, the crew elected to jump for [[Kaets]] rather than calling at [[Triad]].

During the jump to [[Kaets]], one of the crew members who was thought to be recovering suddenly relapsed and died, and other members of the crew started to show symptoms. The crew realized they were in trouble, as they had clearly broken quarantine too early. The cabin which was being used as a medical recovery room was sterilized with a makeshift plasma thrower, but they all knew it was probably too late. The ill crew members were isolated in another cabin where their health declined rapidly and it was obvious they wouldn't survive. Plans were quickly made to abandon ship when they broke out of jump at [[Kaets]]; the survivors debated and agreed that they didn't want to risk infecting anyone else, and made their plans accordingly.

One surviving little girl drew on the sealed door of the cabin containing the bodies of her relatives. Being too young to write, she tried to draw a [[Rynkatropa]], which the medic had told them was probably the source of the disease. The "Coiled Snake" she drew from the description was her interpretation of the being, which has the form of an elongated sea slug.

At [[Kaets]] the remaining crew boarded the ships third Pinnace (normally attached to the [[Annic Nova#Quarters Deck (Locations 6 -19)|Aft Cargo Area of the Cargo Deck - location 25]] - and normally used to provide thrust to the ship) and cast off. The medic and one engineer were the only remaining adults, the pilot was an adolescent, only partly trained; she did cause some damage to the bay doors while disengaging. The other survivors were children. The _Duukhumzi imgiu khimluukshaa_ itself was set loose, programmed by the novice pilot to transmit a warning and a distress call. If approached, the ship was set to calculate and execute a jump, so anyone who ignored the warnings and approached would not be able to board. The Pinnace set off towards the marginally habitable world of [[Kaets]], but not for the starport itself; the evacuees had agreed that they were still a risk to others, and decided instead to set down elsewhere on the sparsely inhabited world until they were sure the disease had run its course.

Only a few weeks later, a curious [[Vargr]] prospector ship approached the _Duukhumzi imgiu khimluukshaa_, which promptly jumped to [[Ghisaersae]]/[[Uthe]].

As it entered the [[Ghisaersae]] system, a curious [[Vargr]] [[Corsair]] noted the arrival of a ship and approached. The _Duukhumzi imgiu khimluukshaa_ jumped again as soon as it had collected enough power. This time it arrived at [[Heya]]/[[Regina Subsector|Regina]], in early 1103. Imperial Interceptors scrambled to investigate the ship transmitting an unintelligible automated message on a restricted frequency, but they were still at extreme range when the ship detected their approach and jumped yet again.

_Duukhumzi imgiu khimluukshaa_ arrived at [[Kinorb]]/[[Regina Subsector|Regina]] a week later, deployed it’s solar sail and recharged it’s capacitors, still transmitting its warning. There is no record of a ship approaching it but this probably happened; it jumped again, to [[Dentus]]/[[Regina Subsector|Regina]] where the scout service attempted to intercept it. The ship made it’s final jump under computer control, but accumulated errors and lack of maintenance made this one a misjump. The ship ended up at [[Keng]], where the computer script finally aborted. [[Keng]] is where the original [[Annic Nova]] adventure takes place, with the mysterious and nameless abandoned ship, and the adventurers who finally board it trying to piece together the story.
