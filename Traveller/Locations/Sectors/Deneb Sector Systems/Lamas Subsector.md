The Lamas subsector is sometimes referred to as 'Pretoria's headache'. About half of its 31 star systems lie outside the Imperial border, with varying attitudes towards the [[Imperium]]. These attitudes shift over time and can be heavily influenced by the activates of raiders, rebels or forces that attempt to counter them.

Lamas was officially incorporated into the [[Imperium]] in the early 500s, but to this day has a troubled relationship with the rest of the [[Imperium]]. There is no subsector duke and no consensus on which of the neighboring dukes should have jurisdiction over the region. As a result, opportunities are exploited in a cut-throat manner that leads to political - and sometimes actual - infighting and problems are often ignored as being someone else's responsibility.

Not coincidentally, Lamas is a hotbed of rebellion, intrigue and piracy. Local leaders do their best to keep the lid on the pot but resources are limited and most world governments lack the capability or authority to do much beyond their own borders. Thus it falls to the [[Imperial Navy]] to maintain order, with the [[Duke of Pretoria]] providing political guidance. However, even here the wind changes from time-to-time, and the navy can suddenly find itself under pressure from the [[Duke of Antra]] or [[Duke of Inar|Inar]] to do something entirely different.

Caught in the middle of this political mess is the 213<sup>th</sup> Imperial Fleet. It says much about the situation in Lamas that although each subsector fleet has a 'unique' numbered designation, the 213th is actually one of three fleets to bear that number. The others are in neighboring [[Spinward Marches]] and [[Corridor Sector|Corridor]], which adds to the confusion. Personnel, requisitions and even entire squadrons of ships are sometimes sent to the wrong 213th Fleet and it is very rare that such windfalls are ever given back.

This has benefited the Lamas subsector fleet as much as hindered it, although it does mean that the fleet deploys a rather strange mix of vessels. The fleet has become something of a political football in recent years, with one subsector duke pressing for more cross-border patrols only for another to demand the 213th pull back and secure trade routes running across the rimward end of the subsector. As a result, the subsector fleet has acquired an unfair reputation for incompetence and weak leadership.
