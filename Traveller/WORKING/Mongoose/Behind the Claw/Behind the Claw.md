# INTRODUCTION

Lying far from the [[Core Sector|Imperial core]], the [[Deneb Sector|Deneb]] and [[Spinward Marches]] sectors combine hazardous frontiers with complex internal politics. It was here that the four great Frontier Wars were fought and, from here, that Admiral Plankwell launched his bid for the Imperial throne. The region is at once a crossroads and a backwater; a frontier and a hotbed of internal politics.

To rimward lies the [[Great Rift]], one of the last unexplored areas of [[Charted Space]]. The rift's distinctive shape, and the long haul around its coreward fringe, give this region its nickname 'behind the Claw'. The rift limits communication with the rest of the [[Imperium]], creating a unique cultural region with external influences almost as strong as those of the Imperial core.

The [[Imperial Navy]] is stretched thin here, defending the borders at the expense of internal security. Some systems are all but lawless; others pay only lip service to Imperial membership and pursue their own goals. Some systems have never been properly surveyed and may yet hold mysteries or hidden dangers; others are ripe for exploitation or conquest. Small wars are common; smuggling, and even piracy, are rife.

As the subsector dukes of [[Deneb Sector]] and [[Spinward Marches]] jockey for power, and the merchant shipping lines vie for control of the spaceways, they must contend with threats both internal and external. To coreward lie the chaotic [[Vargr Extents]], source of endless corsair raids, and the mysterious [[Zhodani Consulate]] with its psionic nobility. To spinward are open frontiers with vast possibilities for daring merchant captains and explorers.

From the ultra-tech of [[Vincennes]] to the undeveloped wastelands of [[Fulacin]], a wealth of opportunities lie waiting behind the Claw. There are deals to be struck in seedy freeports, new trade routes to be opened and hidden resources found on remote worlds. Rebel groups need weaponry; criminal organizations want their illegal goods moved on the quiet. With so many cross-cutting political and economic agendas, there is work aplenty for mercenaries and Travellers who operate with initiative and discretion.

Hundreds of worlds offer an infinite variety of experiences. From unspoiled wilderness roamed by gigantic megafauna, to the dangerous depths of overcrowded cities; from star-baked craters of a vacuum world to unexplored jungles and lofty mountains. Those of more cultured tastes can experience the politically-charged atmosphere of [[Trin]], [[Mora]] and [[Deneb]], where a cocktail party or formal dinner can have sector-wide consequences, or visit the homeworlds of the region's many minor races.

There is endless variety to be found on the worlds behind the Claw. Danger and opportunity; the wondrous and the mundane.

An infinity of adventure awaits...

Using a 400-ton hull, this ship is the raiding vessel of choice for the corsair bands of the Vargr Extents. Despite being of sophisticated design, it is by no means an unusual sight in Vargr space and border regions and one feared by many Travellers.
The advanced corsair typically has a crew of 10 but can carry up to 14 additional crewmembers with double occupancy, usually raiders and boarding party members.
With a maneuver drive powerful enough to run down all but the fastest ships, the average merchant is well-advised to surrender early when pursued by this vessel.

## JAYNE'S GUIDE TO SPACECRAFT OF DENEB

All of the standard vessels in Imperial service can be encountered in Deneb, along with a few designs more or less unique to the region. The vast majority of these ships are commercial or utilitarian in nature, since it is interstellar commerce that supports the battle fleets and specialized vessels.

Most ship operators in Deneb have access only to the mainstream technologies available elsewhere but some can obtain unique items from non-human races or extremely advanced components produced in the TL16 factories of Vincennes.

### VINCENNES TECHNOLOGY

Vincennes has a technological edge over the rest of the [[Imperium|Third Imperium]]. The following High Guard components are available to the shipyards of Vincennes.

Electronics: The electronics suites of [[Vincennes]]-built ships are very advanced, creating significant advantages for their ships. TL16 computer and sensor packages are available in limited numbers on the open market and in greater quantities to those who have the right connections or are friendly with [[Vincennes]].

Processing Tech Level Cost Computer/40 16 MCr40 Core/110 16 MCr150 Sensors TL Suite DM Power Tons Cost Superior 16 Densitometer, Jammers, Lidar, Neural Activity Sensor, Radar

+3 8 8 MCr8.4

Advanced Countermeasures Suite: Improving upon the already formidable military countermeasures suite, this system can overwhelm any enemy communications networks it encounters.

The advanced countermeasures suite grants DM+8 to all attempts at jamming and electronic warfare, regardless of the usual DM of the sensor suite it is attached to.

An advanced countermeasures suite consumes 20 tons and costs MCr40. It requires 5 Power.

Other systems: Ships built at Vincennes typically use advanced jump drives (see page 48 of High Guard ) that have the decreased fuel advantage, while warships are often equipped with black globe generators.

### DEMILITARISED AND CONVERTED WARSHIPS

There are rules in place within the [[Imperium]] regarding who is permitted to operate what sort of ship and what weapon systems can be carried. Accountability is the key factor; a world government is generally considered more accountable for its actions than a small corporation with an easily relocated center of operations.  There is also the level of trust to be considered; a world that has rebelled several times in the last two centuries that suddenly wants to buy battleships, will not receive a favorable response.

Power and influence can override many rules, however, the client must be able to afford the ships. The Imperial authorities do care if the vessels are affordable to the end client, for two reasons. Firstly, there is always the risk that a world government may buy ships it cannot afford, then sell them to less than desirable operators, and secondly the purchase of ships a client cannot afford suggests they will be put to use in the near future.  This interests intelligence services, who constantly watch for internal wars, rebellions and powerplays.

Some trusted operators can build or purchase warships of any capability, but a few technologies are restricted to the Imperial armed forces and are never transferred to other users. For others, options are more limited.  Some classes of ship (such as battleships and fleet carriers) may be prohibited, leading to some interesting legal fictions that allow builds; a few shipyards construct 'heavy commerce protection vessels' that are essentially cruisers for users not normally permitted to have major warships.

Alternatively, ships may be demilitarised before sale.  The precise definition of demilitarization is somewhat flexible but generally means that spinal mounts are removed along with some or all bay weapons. A general reduction in fighting power is always considered 'demilitarization' even if the vessel remains a powerful fighting unit. The areas freed up by the removal of weapon systems can be used for other purposes, although this is never 100% efficient due to the shape and location of spaces.

### Retrofitting

It is common for old warships to be converted into system defence vessels. Whilst some components of the jump drive may be degraded, enough remains reusable in most ships to be a valuable source of spares for other vessels. Components can also be sold to offset the cost of the conversion. A ship that no longer has jump capability does not need enormous fuel tanks and these can be converted to other uses.

Conversely, weaponry and other components can be retrofitted to ships that did not previously have them.  Minor systems, like laser turrets and a small additional power plant to support them, can be fitted into odd spaces, effectively reducing cargo capacity or replacing a stateroom or two.




#### VENTURER-CLASS FAST FREIGHTLINER
Designed and operated exclusively by Tukera Lines – other than a handful of vessels passed to other owners after suffering damage or incidents such as the notorious ships-for-votes affair of 1096 – the _Venture_ **_r_** -class is fast in two ways. First, it has a two-jump-2 capability, enabling it to cross a four-parsec gap between major ports without the need to follow mains or standard shipping routes. The _Venturer_ also uses a lighter-aboard-ship (LASH) configuration to permit rapid cargo transfers.

LASH ships carry little cargo internally but instead use cargo lighters that are little more than powered cargo pods. These can be dropped the moment the ship emerges from jump, to make their way towards the starport under their own power. A replacement set of pre-loaded lighters can be waiting near the jump limit, enabling the vessel to make its second two-parsec jump before a conventional ship would have even reached port. With vessels passing through on the strict schedule for which Tukera is famous, this set-up can be very efficient. It is particularly useful in systems where the mainworld is an asteroid belt or where there are cargoes for several points in the system; all can be delivered at once rather than having to wait for transfer from the main starport.

Of course, this system carries a significant overhead in terms of prepositioned lighters but a small fleet of Venturer -class vessels constantly runs between designated ports, reusing the same lighters and pilots aboard a succession of ships. Normally the standard 100-ton cargo lighter and passenger boat are shipped but when necessary the Venturer can carry a variety of other craft all built on the same hull, with the same fittings.

Lighters are built to TL12 standards on a variety of worlds and used as utility craft by numerous port authorities, world governments and even other shipping operators. The use of a lightly built hull and lower level of technological sophistication keeps costs down and allows these craft to be easily maintained at the ports they visit.

The Venturer is a nominally 3,200 ton design, assuming eight 100-ton lighters are carried aboard. The main hull is rated at 2,400 tons displacement but drives, power plant and fuel assume a full complement of craft. The lighters nestle in recessed cradles and are not quite fully flush with the hull but are well protected against micrometeorite strikes and the like. The ship has little internal cargo space; what there is would normally be used for secure items and ship's stores rather than standard freight. Shipping containers are left aboard the lighters; if a transfer is desired it has to be done manually through airlocks, which is not an easy task. This is not a problem since the lighters themselves transport goods and the ship carries them from system-to-system.

Passengers transfer from the interface craft to internal cabins. Typically, around 28 passenger cabins are available, plus eight high cabins, although this depends on crewing levels aboard the freightliner. Small craft crew normally live aboard their craft but spend most of their time in the main hull whilst in jump.

Accommodation is of a high quality, with generous common areas and additional spaces, such as small conference rooms, for the use of passengers and crew. The ship is lightly armed for self-defence but not intended to leave well-patrolled spaceways. A GEM-ship might venture into the frontier but for the most part these vessels are optimized for operations on a safe, regular run and tend to stick to this role.

#### CARGO LIGHTER

This 100-ton lighter represents the cheapest way possible to carry cargo across a star system, between a highport and LASH-equipped freightliner. The one concession to luxury – if you can call it that - is the provision of a cabin for the crew or a passenger. Many lighter crews more or less live aboard their vessel, although they will  spend most of their working time aboard the parent vessel when it is in jump.

The lighter is designed to nestle in an external cradle but can be carried internally by a ship with at least a 100-ton docking bay. It costs about two and a half times as much as a slow boat built at the same tech level but carries five times as much cargo – albeit even more slowly.

Built on the same hull as the cargo variant, the passenger lighter is an interface craft designed to move personnel from port to starship. It has a small amount of living space and some cargo capacity but otherwise facilities are basic. The crew will usually include a steward who looks after the passengers during their flight to and from their ship. To accommodate this extra crewmember the craft has a second stateroom.

#### FUEL LIGHTER

Less commonly encountered than passenger and cargo lighters, the fuel lighter variant can either be used to refuel a ship quickly or as additional tankage for a longer voyage. A ship making a fast transit can be met by full tankers, which dock in the standard cradles and transfer their fuel to internal tanks before they skim additional fuel or to return to base.
Alternatively they can be carried in jump and used to replenish the ship's internal tanks for a crossing of a wide rift.

#### GUNSHIP LIGHTER

Built on the same hull form, but in a far more robust manner, the gunship version of the lighter looks very similar but can be identified by its much higher acceleration.
The triple laser turret is mounted in a pop-up configuration so as not to impede docking and also to conceal the fact that the craft is armed. Gunships are used for high-value cargo and passenger transfers and allow a freightliner to function in the GEM-ship (Gunship Equipped Merchant)
role. Essentially, this configuration allows the parent vessel to self-escort or provide additional protection to a convoy. The GEM-ship configuration has applications as a paramilitary vessel and gunships are sometimes encountered as light system defence or patrol craft.

The Brilliance class is a long liner, a high-jump passenger vessel with very little cargo capacity. It is built on an 800 ton hull to a very high standard, with an impressive jump-4 performance that allows it to travel directly between important worlds. Long Liners typically follow the x-boat routes or ply between major political or trade centres, although some are available for charter. Others are used for VIP personnel transfers or to host small conferences, with common areas configured for discussion, presentations or planning sessions.

Passenger accommodation is extremely luxurious, with the very best food and drink prepared by skilled stewards. It is not uncommon for liners to provide specialist entertainment or education on for a voyage, often tailoring the choice to the passengers'
preferences. A voyage between two systems might be a chance to meet a famous author or former sports personality, take a course from a high-end artist or enjoy performances by professional entertainers.

The Imperial Navy does not make much use of frigate or, more accurately, considers vessels that others might call frigates to be a subset of destroyer escorts. Most frigates within the [[Imperium]] are in the hands of private (non-Imperial Navy) users such as world governments, corporations or noble houses. Some examples of the Sydkai-class are operated by the Deneb Sector fleet but there are far more ships of this class outside the navy than serving within it.

The Sydkai is designed as a patrol vessel, with good endurance to allow it to remain on-station for extended periods or make a long sweep through backwater systems. It is lightly armored, with sufficient firepower to overwhelm a corsair or raider before serious damage is sustained. The design is new, having been offered by the [[GSbAG]] since 1000 but has demonstrated high capabilities in its intended role. Vessels of this class can be encountered in the private navies of the great nobility or occasionally headed across the border to investigate rumors of a corsair base.

The Deneb Stalwart-class is a common system defence monitor based on a converted P.F Sloan-class fleet escort. As system defence craft go, it is a high performance vessel, well armored and packing a powerful missile punch for its size.

The conversion is a relatively straightforward one, replacing the fuel tanks with armor and a ring of missile bays and the jump drive with a pair of fusion gun bays. The missile bays are arranged in a ring around the middle of the vessel, with the remaining fuel tankage replaced by a thick belt of Crystalliron armor extended over the rest of the hull. Coverage is not even and some critical areas

- notably the command spaces – are less well

protected than the drives and missile armament.
However, on balance the extra armor adds good protection against most threats.

The replacement of the jump drive with fusion guns necessitates some relocation of powerplant systems, making the vessel a little awkward to operate. The fusion guns cannot fire into the forward arc but this is not normally a drawback. A fast close pass allows the guns to fire unimpeded and fire can be maintained as the monitor accelerates away. More commonly, an engagement is carried out with missiles as far as possible.

CAPTAIN, PILOTS X 6, ASTROGATOR, ENGINEERS X 60, MAINTENANCE X 30, GUNNERS X 72, ADMINISTRATORS X 15, MEDICS X 2, STEWARDS X 30

Occasionally the Imperial Navy sells damaged vessels or a client wishes to buy warships but cannot obtain clearance for a full-capability cruiser or battleship.
Even without its spinal mount, a major warship is still a prestigious flagship for a noble or a corporation and can provide useful military capability when operating in a troubled region.

This demilitarised Gionetti has lost its spinal armament, missile capability and tractor beams.
Laser armament has also been reduced, with standard weapons substituted for the advanced beam lasers of the original design. It is otherwise a fully capable warship.

The conversion, in this case, is for the vessel to be the private yacht of a powerful noble. The space originally occupied by the spinal meson gun has been converted into a flight operations center with hangars for up to 1,000 tons of craft. The former meson tube is now open to space for most of its length, acting as a launch/recovery deck for shuttles and rapid recovery of up to 100 tons of craft at once is possible; larger vessels can be accommodated but must make a careful approach and flight through the short remaining section of the tunnel.

There is an element of ego about this arrangement.  The ship retains its original five cutters as subordinate craft but the ability to launch several fighters at once, then the owner's private shuttle, followed by another escort flight has its uses. Rapid recovery might be useful in the event of a hurried departure from negotiations gone awry but more commonly it is used to recover a group of escorting fighters at once just for show.

Other features were fitted in the space vacated by the missile magazines. These include an additional and wholly unnecessary command bridge dedicated purely to controlling flight operations of the owner's shuttle and any escorts, and tracking threats. The owner's grand suite comprises the equivalent of four luxury staterooms and a large reception/relaxation area, plus an armored vault containing another luxury stateroom, private medical facility and a common area.

Guest accommodation is on the other side of the ship, with several luxury staterooms and a dedicated common area serving the occupants. Former missile storage space now holds a small biosphere created as an ornamental garden, a rather grand library, a firing range and a stable. There is also a ballroom the size of a small merchant ship.

The interior of the ship has been extensively redecorated, with the former drab scheme replaced with real wood panelling and soft carpets. Even the original crew cabins and working areas have been refurbished to improve comfort and – more importantly to the owner – impress those lucky enough to be invited aboard.

Built by the advanced shipyards of Vincennes, the Kehmed dreadnoughts represent the cutting edge of warship design within the spinward sectors of the [[Imperium|Third Imperium]]. Each ship of the class is named after one of the metroplexes on Vincennes and they are a source of pride for many of the inhabitants of the system.

Like the older Plankwell-class, the Kehmed is a traditional battleship with no troop contingent carried aboard. It is intended for a pure warfighting role, smashing the enemy battle line and moving on. Other ships can land marines or mop up whatever resistance remains; these highly advanced battlewagons are too expensive and too potent to be wasted on peacekeeping or insurgency suppression missions. The swing towards multirole capital ships was always controversial and it does seem that a return to specialist designs is the way forward.

The term 'dromedary' is given to support vessels that carry both fuel and dry stores, typically used to support small squadron or task force operations where a fleet tanker and auxiliaries would be wasteful.
Dromedaries are inefficient when used to support major fleets but are often pressed into that role. Most replenishment tasks are undertaken directly with the ship's UNREP system but there is hangar space for six 100-ton craft such as Ilauus-class shuttles, which can be used for resupply tasks.

The Shuigabumudkhar-class is large enough to resupply destroyers but is not sufficient for cruiser or capital ship operations. In peacetime, dromedaries can sometimes be encountered ferrying cargo on behalf of Imperial armed forces, acting as additional resupply ships for army deployments or undertaking other mundane tasks.

Strategic mobility is standard for Imperial fleet assets (jump-4) and with 4g acceleration the Shuigabumudkhar-class is sufficiently agile to respond to most situations. It is lightly armored and armed to repel strikes by minor enemy combatants but relies on escorts for protection.

The Ilauus-class is defined by its builder as a fast multipurpose shuttle. It is commonly associated with the Shuigabumudkhar-class dromedary and other Imperial Navy replenishment ships but can be encountered in other roles. Its expense ensures that few non-government operators exist, although there are civilian concerns that perceive a need for a high-acceleration, lightly armored cargo hauler.

The Ilauus-class is essentially a cargo hold with a powerful drive. Its small bridge is very cramped, although this is offset by the provision of two crew cabins. Normal operating complement is four in naval hands – a pilot/commander, co-pilot, engineering technician and a gunner. Most Ilauus-class vessels are equipped with a dual sandcaster turret, increasing their chances of survival as they dash between fleet units in an emergency. Some are instead fitted with a laser armament and may even be pressed into service as customs, law enforcement or patrol assets.

The majority of craft are, however, carried aboard fleet logistics ships or orbital stations and are configured either as dry cargo haulers or fuellers for small vessels. Some are outfitted with seats or acceleration couches for personnel transportation. An experiment using these craft as forward fighter-control units met with some success but has not been implemented on a large scale.

The Gagh is a common small merchant or transport vessel optimized for low-cost haulage. Although it has spare cabins when running with a small crew, it is rare to find this vessel carrying passengers in the normal manner. More commonly, the extra cabin space is used for the patron of a charter (or their representative), or as extra living space for the crew.

SLEIPNIR-CLASS PATROLLER

The Confederation has dozens of these ships in tours around the subsector at all times, their sensors sweeping for threats.
When enemies are found, the Sleipnir is a more than capable small-engagement vessel that can handle auxiliary craft and small warships – even Imperial ones.
There is little comfort inside these ships, especially when conscripted to hold marines or kommandos under the low ceiling and amidst crash-webbing and storage racks. It is not used for full-scale battles against battlecruisers or other massive foes but can hold its own against more common threats stumbled upon during patrols.
