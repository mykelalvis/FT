Star Lane contains 30 star systems, all of which are Imperial territory. Ten of these systems form part of a cluster extending into Vincennes and Gulf. This region is heavily influenced by the duchy of Vincennes whether the local nobility like it or not, leading to endless political machinations.

The Duke of Vincennes cannot directly command the votes of the Star Lane nobility when an issue is debated in the Imperial Moot but tries to control their voting by making life difficult until he wants something, then offering incentives – which sometimes amount to little more than a cessation of harassment – to align their votes with those of his supporters.

The counts of Askigaak, as senior Imperial nobles in the region, have long expected to be elevated to subsector dukes. Opposition to Vincennes' influence stems in part from a desire to be seen to be powerful, capable and independent and at times this is more important to the counts than local stability. Askigaak and Vincennes have been known to throw obstacles in one another's way for purely political reasons, often hamstringing worthy projects.

With no subsector duke in place, the spinward-coreward cluster around Daumier tends to look to Mora in the Spinward Marches for leadership and support. Most worlds in this area are undeveloped but Mater Nova has a sufficiently large economy to benefit from its position at the extreme end of the Spinward Main.

The remainder of the subsector's worlds are mostly concentrated in two small clusters of no great importance. These areas are markets for the huge economies of Mora and Vincennes, with large jump-2 freighters making the rounds on a frequent – if not always regular – basis.

The 196th Fleet, charged with maintaining security and stability in the subsector, both suffers and benefits from a lack of political direction. Its bases all lie in the primary cluster, requiring long transits to reach distant patrol stations. Under normal circumstances, Imperial fleets are advised by the local high nobility – although they are not commanded directly by those nobles – but without a subsector duke in place the 196th Fleet lacks a clear political strategy of its own and is subject to the influences of the Dukes of Vincennes and Mora. Whilst its senior officers have more autonomy than is the case in many subsector fleets, it is impossible to please both dukes as well as the local less senior nobility and the fleet finds itself enmeshed in endless political wrangling.
