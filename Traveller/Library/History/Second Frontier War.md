# The Second Frontier War

The Second Frontier War (61 5 to 620) began in the later years of the Civil War, as the Zhodani and the Vargr saw that their stalemated First Frontier War had disrupted the fabric of the Imperium. The disbanded Dutworld Coalition reformed and struck again, this time deeper into the Jewell subsector. The fierce initial batties strengthened local resolve, and drew the war out for several years. Grand Admiral Arbellatra Alkhalikoi fought a holding action accompanied with behind-the-lines raids for nearly three years in Jewell subsector. Finally, the sector's shipyards finished construction of several large dreadnaughts, and they, coupled with reinforcements irom trailing sectors, enabled a decisive engagement which stalemated both sides. Alkhalikoi accepted the dangerous responsibility of ceding more territory to the Zhodani and of releasing perhaps a dozen systems previously incorporated into the lmperium, rendering them independent.

Alkhalikoi then emulated her predecessor, hault-Plankwell, and moved to the Imperial capital. The Civil War still raging, she met and defeated the remnants of the Centre: Fleet operating under the command of the barracks Emperor Gustus. Her actions ended the Civil War.
