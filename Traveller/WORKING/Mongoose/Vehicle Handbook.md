## INTRODUCTION

Universes of science fiction are filled with vehicles ranging from the mundane to the exotic. A starport on a world far beyond the frontier may see a mix of pedal- powered rickshaws, horse-drawn wagons and anti-grav skimmers. A high-tech centralised and industrial world will have skies filled with the anti-grav equivalent of cars, trucks and buses, while its military will be able to deploy armored tanks who can withstand bombardment from spacecraft in orbit above them. All of these, and many more, can be created with the Vehicle Handbook.

The Vehicle Handbook has been designed to be quick and easy to use, whether your Travellers are looking to quickly upgrade or modify their humble air/raft, or construct a massive battle-ready walker armed with city- crushing weaponry from scratch.

Vehicles created with this book are completely compatible with those found in the Traveller Core Rulebook and they utilise the same rules for travel and combat. The only difference is that vehicles created with this book are your vehicles, unique to your universe. With just a little practice, you will be able to create small and basic vehicles (such as a ground car or grav-bike) in just a minute or so, allowing you to quickly create vehicles almost on the fly during a game. However, even a large, multi-turreted super-heavy battle tank will not take much longer than five minutes' work.

The key to this is that the design system focuses on the final performance of a vehicle, rather than all of its individual components. You will not find complicated charts of different engines, reactors and other power systems, cross-referenced with a vehicle's mass and aerodynamic performance. At the end of the day, whether a vehicle is propelled by steam or a fusion reactor driving gravitic thrusters is completely up to you. What is important, as far as its design is concerned, is how fast it can go and what it can carry as it travels.

The entire vehicle design sequence is a simple step-by- step process that we will walk you through, allowing you to choose basic designs and then modify them to fit into your universe.

The Vehicle Handbook is rounded off with a complete catalogue filled with vehicles built using this system, allowing you to dive straight in and begin populating your worlds with vehicles the Travellers can ride, purchase and fight against.

## NEW RULES

The Vehicle Handbook requires the use of several new rules in addition to those within the _Traveller Core Rulebook,_ all of which are presented here.

MAINTENANCE AND RESUPPLY
All vehicles require routine maintenance and the occasional topping up of fuel and other essentials. This is part of general vehicle care though all vehicles should spend at least one day in a well-equipped workshop each year for a full service, and advanced military vehicles may require a great deal more attention.

For the purposes of Traveller, this is assumed to be covered by a simple monthly maintenance cost equal to 0.5% of the total cost of the vehicle. This will cover all essentials and refills other than ammunition and other stated extra costs.

Referees are free to ignore this rule if they wish to avoid the book keeping, but remember: even a bicycle should be kept in good working order!

SENSORS AND DETECTION
Vehicles have access to a variety of systems to detect objects in their vicinity, from eyes and headlights to radar, lidar and densitometers (see page 54 for vehicle sensors).

The type of sensors a vehicle is equipped with will define their Range and any bonus to checks made to detect objects. These checks will use the Electronics (sensors) skill, though vehicles lacking even basic sensors will instead be reliant on a Traveller's Recon checks.

To detect any given object that is within Range of a vehicle's sensors requires an Average (8+) Electronics
(sensors) check (1D seconds, INT).

#### Range

If the object is within half this Range, DM+2 is applied, and if it is within a quarter of this Range, DM+4 is applied.

Size Larger vehicles are always easier to detect, whether advanced sensors or a Traveller's own eyesight are used. For every full 25 Spaces a vehicle has, DM+1 is applied to checks made to detect it.

Hiding If the object is hidden from view, DM-2 is applied and the referee may rule that the sensors are unable to detect it at all (in general, if there is no line of sight, sensors of TL10 or less will be unable to detect it).

Camouflage and stealth customizations can make detection increasingly difficult. See page 54 for more details.

Shipping Large Vehicles
It is more efficient to ship a single large vehicle than several smaller ones. Vehicles over 30 Shipping Tons can halve this value, to a minimum of 30 tons.

Towing
Most vehicles are capable of towing heavy loads, usually a form of trailer or, in an emergency, other vehicles. All checks using a vehicle's Agility suffer DM-2 while it is towing. Its Speed is reduced by one band for every 25% of its Spaces (or 25% of its Spaces multiplied 250 kg) it is towing, or part of.

Used Vehicles
Buying second-hand vehicles is a time-honored process, and Travellers short of a few credits might try their luck on the used market.

If a Traveller is looking for a specific type of vehicle, the referee might require a Broker or Streetwise check to locate it, imposing negative DMs if the vehicle is beyond the ordinary.

A used vehicle will cost 1D x 10% less than a new one.

However, cynical Travellers will well know that one can never be absolutely sure of a used vehicle, and the referee should roll 2D whenever one is purchased. On the roll of 8+, generate at least one quirk using the [[#Used Vehicle Quirks]] table.

### Used Vehicle Quirks

2D Quirk
2 Bad Luck
The vehicle seems cursed – the referee is free to impose a Bane on any important skill checks when using the vehicle.
3 What a Piece of Junk: There is something about this vehicle's proportions or assembly that just does not seem right. When placed next to another, similar vehicle, it will look cheap, ugly, ridiculous, or all three.
4 Concealed Compartment: The vehicle has a concealed compartment somewhere within its hull, allowing items to be hidden. 5 Gutless: The vehicle's motive systems have seen better days. Reduce Speed by one Band.
6 Sloppy Controls
The control systems have far too much play in them. Apply DM-1 to any Drive, Flyer, or Seafarer checks. 7 Poor Fuel Economy: The vehicle is nowhere near as efficient as when it was new. Range is reduced by 10%.

8 Faulty Sensors
Every time the vehicle's sensors are used, roll 1D. On 6+, they impose DM-4 to the check.

9 Boy Racer
The previous owner liked to... 'improve' his vehicles. Increase Speed by one Band but generate D3 more quirks.
10 Difficult to Modify: Any new customization performed on the vehicle costs twice as much.
11 What is That Smell?: The vehicle's interior smells disgusting, and no amount of searching seems to pinpoint its source. 12 Jalopy: The vehicle seems decidedly unsafe. Reduce its Hull by 1D x 10%,

VEHICLE TRAITS
Many vehicles have specific traits which grant them special abilities or penalise them in some way.

AFV
This vehicle has been designed with combat in mind and features sloping armor, composite materials, and structural reinforcement appropriate to its Tech Level. A vehicle with the AFV trait may have up to three times the armor it is normally allowed for its Tech Level
(see page 34).

ATV

The vehicle is equipped to handle difficult terrain. This trait provides DM+2 to any Drive checks made to negotiate difficult terrain.

Off-Roader

The vehicle has had its drive and suspension systems modified to handle rough terrain. This trait provides DM+1 to any Drive checks made to negotiate difficult terrain.

### Open Vehicle

The vehicle has an open construction which makes it light, but exposes crew and passengers to the elements. Open Vehicles grant no cover to their crew or passengers, but any Traveller on board can shoot
(or otherwise attack) in any direction.

### Tracked

The vehicle is equipped to handle extremely difficult terrain. This trait provides DM+4 to any Drive checks made to negotiate difficult terrain.

WEAPON TRAITS
The following weapon trait from the Central Supply Catalogue is also used in this book.

### One Use

This weapon is designed to be used just once, completely expending its energy or ammunition in one go and then being rendered useless.

##### VEHICLE DESIGN

The vehicle design system detailed in this chapter allows you to modify existing vehicles (such as those found in the Vehicle Catalogue later in this book or those within other supplements) or create your own, limited by only your imagination and that of your players.

Throughout the design process, you will keep track of two key numbers – the number of Spaces the vehicle has (and how much Space each added component consumes) and the total cost. The mathematics required to create a vehicle are not complex by any stretch, but you may find it handy to scribble notes as you go on some scrap paper!

Unless the referee states otherwise, it can be assumed that the Tech Level of the vehicle and its components will be the same as the system in which it is being constructed. However, you may always install components of a lower Tech Level if you wish, perhaps in an effort to cut costs.

MASS PRODUCTION
Some vehicles are manufactured in numbers of thousands or even millions, and have become standard across the stars. Specifications for such vehicles are freely available and components can be purchased in bulk by factories, greatly reducing the cost of the vehicle's construction.

A referee can choose to classify a vehicle as being mass-produced and is free to round its cost down to the nearest Cr1000, Cr10000 or Cr100000, as he deems appropriate.

Construction Times
Construction times vary wildly, depending on the size and complexity of the vehicle and the capabilities of the factory or workshop. On average, assume that it takes one day per thousand credits to build a vehicle in an average workshop.

### Step 1

Chassis Type Simply select a suitable chassis from the Core Chassis Types chapter, starting on page 13, and determine the Tech Level of the system the vehicle is being built within.

### Step 2

Spaces and Base Characteristics Using the information detailed within the chassis type you have selected in the previous step, select the number of Spaces the vehicle will have – this will govern its ultimate size. Using the number of Spaces you have chosen and the Tech Level of the vehicle, you will then be able to determine the vehicle's current cost and Hull, as well as its Speed, Range, and Agility. Any chassis-specific modifications are added at this point.

### Step 3

Weapons and Armor If your vehicle is going to face combat, now is the time to equip it with armor and weapons. These are detailed in the Weapons and Armor chapters, starting on page 34.

### Step 4

Customization Further modifications to the vehicle can be found in the Customization chapter, starting on page 46. The modifications here will allow you to tweak the vehicle's performance and add new items of equipment.

Design Checklist

**1. Choose a Chassis Type (page 13) and Tech Level.**
**2. Select the number of Spaces the**
**vehicle will have and determine the**
**vehicle's base Agility, Speed, Range,**
**Hull and Cost.**
**3. Install any**
**weapons and**
**armor (page 34). 4. Apply any Customization (page 46) and determine any change to the vehicle's Agility, Speed, Range, Hull and Cost. 5. Determine Crew and Passengers
(page 6). 6. Allocate Cargo Space (page 6). 7. Finalise Design
(page 6).**

Note that all fractions (such as when a modification consumes 25% of a vehicle's Spaces) are rounded up at this stage. All adjustments like this based on percentages are calculated using the vehicle's starting values.

So, for example, a 100 Space vehicle that has its Range increased twice (see page 46) will lose 20% of its Spaces, leaving it with 80 Spaces (you do not deduct 10% once, and then 10% again, which would result it being left with 81 Spaces).

### Step 5

Crew and Passengers All vehicles require a minimum crew of 1, who will act as the driver or pilot. Vehicles of more than 100 Spaces in size will usually require a co-pilot. If they are to be permanently manned, each weapon system that does not have a fixed forward mount will also require a crew member.

Each crew member and passenger will require 1 Space for basic seating. This kind of seating allows for little or no movement within the vehicle, effectively keeping each passenger and crew member in place (such as with a car, fighter jet or tank).

If crew and passengers need to move about within a vehicle (to reach engineering systems, cargo areas or freshers, for example), more Space needs to be dedicated to them. The more Space dedicated to each crew member or passenger, the more comfortable they will be.

If 2 Spaces are dedicated to each passenger or crew member, things will be extremely cramped on board
(similar to the conditions on board a submarine or cattle class on an airliner). 3 Spaces will allow a greater degree of movement (business class on an airliner, perhaps), while 5 Spaces per crew member or passenger will make even long distance travel at least tolerable (first class on an airliner, or what might be typical on an ocean liner).

There is no limit as to how many Spaces can be dedicated per passenger or crew member, and as many passengers as wished can be included in the vehicle for no cost other than the Spaces dedicated to them.

Alien Crew and Passengers Many alien species can cope with vehicles designed for human occupants with a little adjustment, but larger aliens require special facilities for any kind of extended use. Hivers require 50% more Spaces allocated to them, while K'kree require double the amount.

### Step 6

Cargo Space Any Spaces remaining after customization and crew/ passengers is allocated to cargo space. A vehicle can carry 250 kg for every Space that is dedicated to cargo.

Referee Fiat While you can go a long, long way designing vehicles with the rules presented in this book, creating everything from unicycles to advanced hypersonic airliners capable of traversing alien atmospheres, the Vehicle Handbook is not intended as a hard set of mechanics. Rather, it is a toolkit to provide referees and Travellers with a framework with which to create their designs, rather than limit them.

The referee, therefore, is always free to 'jiggle' things and smooth out any rough edges in order to create the vehicles he wants to see in his setting. We have intentionally put a lot of 'fuzziness' into the design system (such as with the space allocated to passengers and the Speed Bands) to make this easier but if the referee wishes to go further... he has our blessing!

If, for example, you want to create a helicopter that has a special fuselage that is shaped to float on water, don't feel you need to add the Floats option. You are free to say that ability is part of the vehicle's natural design. If you want to build a large vehicle that can nonetheless fit inside the cargo hold of a Subsidized Merchant, again, simply tweak the Shipping Size of your final design.

The Golden Rule is that the final designs must fit into the universe you have created. It is perfectly acceptable to adjust any characteristics of a vehicle in order to do so.

### Step 7

Finalise Design Once the previous steps are complete, your vehicle is almost ready to take to the streets, wilderness, seas or sky! Record all of the vehicle's characteristics and cost, along with any modifications, equipment or Traits it has acquired along the way.

The Speed and Range of the vehicle determines its maximum performance but this is rarely used in day- to-day operation. Instead, it is usually more useful to record a vehicle's Cruising performance.

A vehicle's Cruise Speed is one Speed Band lower than its maximum (so, for example, a vehicle capable of Fast speed would travel at High speed when cruising).

A vehicle's Cruise Range is 50% greater than its usual maximum (so, a vehicle with Range 150 would have Range 225 when cruising).

After this last step is completed, you are ready to name your vehicle, grab the keys, and take it out for a trial run!

EXAMPLE OF

VEHICLE DESIGN Those are the simple steps needed to create a vehicle – now let us put them into practice!

A group of four Travellers have a Far Trader, but they want an auxiliary vehicle they can store in the cargo

hold for expeditions around strange planets. It needs to be small and it needs to be rugged. They quickly decide a gun will be a plus point (they are Travellers, after all...). They eventually decide on something between a buggy and a truck, but want to avoid any kind of grav technology as that will be too expensive for their tastes.

Step 1:

CHASSIS

The first step is to choose a chassis type. With grav vehicles already dismissed as an idea, the natural choice will be a ground vehicle. As it only needs to carry four Travellers and their kit, a Light Ground Vehicle will suffice. They are currently on a TL12 world, so this will be the Tech Level the vehicle is built at.

Consulting the Light Ground Vehicle on page 14, we can fill in some of the specifications in the roster immediately.

Being TL12, it will be Fast (and cruise at High speed), and have a Range of 600 km (900 km when cruising). It also starts with an Agility of +0.

Step 2:

TRAITS

Now we have to decide how big the vehicle should be. As we said before, we want it to carry four Travellers, so that will need 4 Spaces. A weapon was wanted and, to stop the gun nut among them going too mad, this will be restricted to a single Space. Some cargo-carrying capacity is going to be useful (and can always be used by customization at a late date). Half a ton of cargo will equate to 2 Spaces, bringing up the total to 7 Spaces. We'll add one more Space, just to be on the safe side, as this will allow us to add something fun a bit later.

Consulting page 14 once more, an 8 Space Light Ground Vehicle will normally cost Cr750 per Space, but

the Travellers want something a bit rugged that can go over rough terrain, so they select the Off-Roader trait for an additional Cr100 per Space. At Cr850 per Space, this means the vehicle will come to Cr6800. Not bad for something that can already carry all the Travellers about, plus their kit!

Step 3:

HULL

Now we know how large the vehicle is, we can fill in more of its roster. Going back to page 14, an 8 Space Light Ground Vehicle will have Hull 16 (can take a knock or two) and a Shipping Size of 4 tons – it will fit neatly in the hold of just about any spacecraft!

Knowing it is going to be driven around by Travellers, we can now move onto to the next step, to toughen the vehicle up a bit!

Step 4

PROTECTION

Turning to page 34, we can see what armor the vehicle comes with. At TL12, it starts off with 4 points of Protection on all sides, a good place to begin. However, believing they will be shot at from time to time, the Travellers decide to double this to 8 points of Protection.

Consulting the Vehicle Armor table on page 34, we can see that every extra point of Protection above 4 will consume 0.4% of the vehicle's total Spaces and add 0.5% to its cost. So, if we want to add an additional 4 points of Protection to bring it up to 8 points total, this extra armor will consume 1.6% of its Spaces and increase the vehicles Cost per Space by 2%.

So, on an 8 Space vehicle, a single Space is consumed by the extra armor (rounding up to the next full Space), and its cost per Space goes from Cr850 to Cr867 (for a total of Cr6936).

As you can see, that was a very cheap upgrade which vastly improves the durability of the vehicle (though it is not going to resist any kind of sustained fire). Be warned though, once you start messing around with battle tanks, you will find armor starts costing a significant amount and consuming lots of precious space!

However, the Travellers are not stopping there with protection. Being Travellers, they figure they will drive into things. A lot. So, using the Armor Allocation rules on page 35, they move two points of Protection from the rear facing of the vehicle, and add it to the front.

After all, whatever is behind you does not matter, right?

Step 5

WEAPONRY AND SPACE

The Travellers want a gun on their vehicle. A nice, meaty one. This will, naturally, start a lot of debate between them but we'll skip to the end of the arguments. They will settle on the Light Autocannon
(see page 42), as it consumes just a single space, has the Auto 3 trait and kicks out 6D damage – what is there for a Traveller not to like?

The autocannon is installed on a pintle mount on the top of the vehicle, so the Travellers can blast away at whatever they are chasing to their hearts' content, and it only costs Cr250.

Including the mount, this will add Cr10250 to the cost of the vehicle, bringing the running total up to Cr17186, and consumes another Space.

One Traveller suddenly remembers they need to include seats for themselves in the vehicle which, for four of them, will require 4 Spaces, leaving them with just 2 Spaces free in the vehicle (Space allocation for seating can actually be done at any time during vehicle design, but we figured there was no way the average Traveller would even consider it until after the weapons had gone in...).

Mykel Alvis (Order #30209357)

When mounting weapons, there is always the option to add fire control to help with its attack rolls (see page 45). However, the Travellers have just had the sticker shock of that autocannon and fire control can get very expensive, very quickly. So, they are swayed by the argument of the gun bunny among them who says they do not need fire control because his aiming skills are, quote, 'wicked'.

Step 6

CUSTOMISATION

The last stage is customization, adding tweaks and equipment to personalise the vehicle and make it a better fit for its intended function.

Thus far, the Travellers have spent Cr17186, and have just 2 Spaces left in their vehicle.

They have pegged those 2 Spaces for transporting equipment, as it would give them half a ton of cargo Space (each unused Space can be converted into 0. tons of cargo space in any vehicle). However, who are we kidding, these are Travellers – giving them the Customization chapter on page 46 is like giving children the keys to a sweet shop and telling them to be sensible.

The first thing they come across is the possibility of increasing the vehicle's speed. However, this is very expensive and an argument breaks out between the Travellers which is only resolved when someone points out the vehicle can already exceed 200 mph, and the best driver among them only has Drive (wheel) 1. This proves convincing.

More customization options are considered, including Control Systems and Autopilots, but these are all quite expensive, and the Travellers have frankly already blown their budget by mounting that Cr10000 autocannnon on the vehicle's roof.

That lasts right up until someone spots the Auxiliary Thrusters on page 48 and says something along the lines of 'oh, wow, we can hop about, just like the Mako!'

A minimal thruster system consumes a single Space
(leaving the Travellers with just one, and they seem to have forgotten about carrying cargo...), and adds another Cr10000, for a total of Cr27186.

See how things can add up rather quickly once you start adding toys?

It is with some disappointment that the Travellers realise that a fission plant requires a minimum of 10 Spaces (plus a lot of shielding, unless they want to be constantly downing Anti-rad pills), but they are somewhat mollified once they get to the various electronics that can be mounted in vehicles.

They add an Advanced Communication System (from page 51) for just Cr250, but decide they do not need to spend the extra on increasing its range, making it encrypted, or providing a satellite uplink.

The Travellers do not add a Computer, as they figure they will always have their datapads with them and while the likes of ECM systems are considered, they are eventually discarded as being frivolous.

Finally, the Travellers make their way to the end of the Customization chapter, which we have called Creature Comforts and Utility. And yes, we put this part in specifically to part Travellers from their Credits.

The first thing they add is a crane, though none of them can quite remember why, other than 'it might be useful'. This costs another Cr1000 but, more to the point, consumes another Space, meaning the vehicle no longer has any room for cargo. The Travellers justify this by saying it is only intended for short journeys anyway, and they can carry their provisions and weapons on their laps as they drive.

TURBO

So, they now start scouring the Creature Comforts and Utility section for anything that does not consume Spaces – and they immediately hit upon two winners.

Firstly, the Wet Bar. For a mere Cr2000, no journey will ever be a dry one. Frankly, you might consider this standard equipment for any Traveller-designed vehicle. Even the unmanned drones.

Second, one Traveller spies the Ejection Seat, but he was not quiet about installing it in his crew position and, before anyone could say 'how much?' everyone had an Ejection Seat. That cost a mere Cr5000 per seat, for a total of Cr20000.

Step 7

FINAL THOUGHT

And that is it, the vehicle is done!

What started as a cheap runabout that could handle a bit of rough terrain is now a Cr50000 off-roader that mounts military-grade weaponry, has a crane but no cargo space, and ejection seats all round. Oh, and the bar of course.

This is possibly a very good argument for not passing the Vehicle Handbook to your Travellers, but ours are nonetheless very proud of their creation and are sure other starship crews will soon be copying the design. They dutifully write up the last additions to the vehicle on its roster, and put their heads together to come up with a suitable name for it.

##### CORE CHASSIS TYPES

There are a range of chassis types possible in Traveller, allowing you to create anything from a small motorbike to a massive battleship. Each chassis type will provide its own set of characteristics that will end up defining the final vehicle design in Traveller, along with some customization options that are specific to that chassis.

LIGHT GROUND VEHICLE Light ground vehicles are prolific on industrialised worlds as they emerge into technological adolescence. They are typically used for individual or group transportation, such as with the ubiquitous family car, and quickly become commonplace for all but the very poor. Because of their low cost, light ground vehicles can still be found on worlds with a higher base of technology where anti-grav vehicles should otherwise have rendered them obsolete.

UNPOWERED VEHICLE These vehicles do not possess a motive system of their own and rely on the muscles of beasts of burden (as in the case of a cart or wagon) or their own crew (such as a rickshaw or bicycle). Clever mechanics can increase the speed of the vehicle beyond that of its occupants on foot, but if it is being pushed or pulled, it speed can never exceed that of the creatures' own movement.

Wind-powered (TL3) By using sails more commonly seen on waterborne vehicles, a light chassis can be propelled at some surprising speed. However, the vehicle is utterly reliant on prevailing conditions and its maximum speed can never exceed that of the current wind. This increases the Cost per Space by Cr200.

Tech Table TL Speed 1-6 Very Slow 7-9 Slow 10+ Medium

UNPOWERED BOAT Ships and boats provide the best means to transport people and cargo long distances wherever seas or rivers are present. Such craft can be powered by rowers on board and while this makes the vessel largely immune to the effects of wind, those that utilise sails are far more efficient. The possible speeds listed assume fresh crews and benevolent winds, and can be lowered by the referee to reflect adverse conditions. Range is effectively limited only by the food and supplies that can be carried by the craft.

**Outboard Motor (TL3)** For the convenience of the crew, an outboard motor can be fitted to a rowed or sailing boat. These cost Cr per Space of the craft to be moved, propel the craft at a minimum of Idle speed and have a Range of 100 km. At a cost of Cr250 per Space, this minimum Speed can be increased to Very Slow.

POWERED BOAT Boats are a common sight on the rivers and coastlines of any civilised world and, due to their cheapness and utility, remain viable even when grav vehicles begin appearing. Small boats have a wide variety of applications, from harvesting the sea and pleasure use, to rescuing stranded seafarers and small-scale military operations.

bubble of atmosphere and propels it forward through the use of rockets, jets or thrusters. By eliminating the friction of the water surrounding it, the supercavitating drive is capable of driving the submersible forward at very high speeds.

Supercavitating drives consume a percentage of the total number of Spaces the submersible has, as shown on the Supercavitating Drive table (minimum 10 Spaces).

HEAVY SUBMERSIBLE Heavy submersibles can reach the size of many of the ships they sail beneath and while some are used for carrying cargo, especially on worlds that have a hostile or dangerous atmosphere, most have military applications.

### AIRSHIP

Airships use a gas envelope containing a large volume of lighter-than-air gas (typically helium) to rise through the air. Engines provide forward motion without having to expend energy to gain height, making an airship efficient but slow. An airship without engines is a balloon and at the mercy or prevailing winds.

Lifting Body (TL7) This is a hybrid aircraft, combining rigid wings and a lift-generating fuselage with a gas envelope which, in itself, is capable of supporting the entire craft. This is, in a way, the best of both worlds, providing a massive lifting capability with increased speed.

HELICOPTER, AERODYNE

AND ORNITHOPTER Helicopters use large diameter rotors (usually a single rotor, though larger helicopters may have two) to provide both lift and thrust. This is an inefficient method of aerial travel but it does allow helicopters to take-off and land without the need for a runway. Ornithopters use moving wings to gain lift, which is even more inefficient, but they sometimes appear due to specific atmospheric conditions or cultural bias. At higher Tech Levels, aerodynes become possible, using similar principles but replacing the rotor with jet thrust.

# ARMOR

While civilian vehicles are rarely armored unless they are expected to endure in harsh, wilderness conditions, any vehicle intended to face combat is likely to have the best armor its design, Tech Level and budget can manage. An extra layer of armor may increase a vehicle's cost but can make the difference between shrugging off an attack and being crippled by a single shot.

The armor present on a vehicle and the maximum amount it can carry, is very much dependant on its Tech Level. Early vehicles require heavy iron or steel plating to give them any significant protection but lighter and more resilient materials become available as Tech Level increase.

The Vehicle Armor table shows what armor Protection a vehicle begins with at the start of the design process, and the maximum amount this can be increased to.

The cost of the armor is a percentage of the cost of the vehicle's chassis per additional point of Protection. Spaces consumed is the amount of Spaces the armor will use per additional point of Protection. In all cases, round upwards.

#### Vehicle Armor

TL Starting Protection Maximum Protection Cost Spaces Consumed Materials Used 0-2 0 10 5% 2.5% Wood

3-5 1 15 3% 1.5% Iron

6-8 2 20 2% 1% Steel, Composites

9-11 3 30 1% 0.5% Crystaliron

12-14 4 40 0.5% 0.4% Bonded Superdense, Cast Diamond 15-17 4 50 0.25% 0.3% Molecular Bonded, Cerametals, Spun Diamond 18+ 5 60 0.1% 0.25% Coherent Superdense

AFV TRAIT If a vehicle has the AFV trait, the Maximum Protection listed on the Vehicle Armor table is tripled.

So, for example, a 20 Space TL12 AFV heavy ground vehicle starts with 4 points of Protection. If we increase that to 80 points, it will consume 7 Spaces (adding 76 points of Protection, requiring 30.4% of the total Spaces, rounding up to 7) and, assuming a chassis cost of Cr120000, will cost an additional Cr45600.

ARMOR

### LOCATIONS

The Protection armor provides a vehicle is used for any attacks that come from the front, sides or rear (see Traveller Core Rulebook page 134). A vehicle that is attacked from the top or bottom (such as an attack launched from a rooftop or the vehicle travelling over a mine) has its Protection halved, rounding down.

ARMOR

### ALLOCATION

The above assumes that armor is allocated more or less evenly across all surfaces of the vehicle. However, it is very common, especially on military vehicles, to increase the armor in one location at the expense of another. The result is that the vehicle is far more resilient to attacks coming in from a specific direction but it avoids the cost and weight of excess armor. Typically, this is done with armored vehicles intended for the front line, such as tanks, where armor is concentrated to the front.

Armor can be reallocated between the front, rear, top and bottom on a point-by-point basis.

_For example, if 4 points of armor were removed from the rear of a vehicle, 2 points could be added to the front and 1 point each applied to the top and bottom._

Armor can be allocated to and from the side of a vehicle on a 1 point of side armor to 2 points of armor elsewhere basis.

Nuclear Dampers Nuclear dampers are passive defensive devices which create an interference field in which the strong nuclear force can be manipulated. A series of nodes and anti- nodes are created, either to enhance or degrade the strong nuclear force.

Focussing a negative node on incoming nuclear war- heads lowers the potential barriers around nuclei, thus suppressing the strong force; the warheads shed neu- trons at very low energies and are rendered harmless after a short exposure. Both fission and fusion warheads are affected, as fusion warheads use a fission trigger to create the heat required for the fusion reaction.

For example, if you wanted to increase the side armor of a vehicle by 1 point, you could remove 2 points of armor from the rear of the vehicle to do it.

If a vehicle has no separate top or bottom armor listed in its description, assume they are equal to the value of the side facing.

THEVEHICLE HANDBOOK COLLECTION

While most military vehicles will feature at least a 'defensive' weapon to keep attackers at bay, even civilian vehicles can benefit from a mounted machinegun or laser if they stray into dangerous territory. However, weapons cannot simply be plastered all over a vehicle as they require specific mounting points to function correctly.

Before a weapon can be attached to a vehicle, a mount must be purchased and installed for it. The mounts available are listed here. Each has its own range of benefits and features, though not every mount is suitable for every weapon.

A pintle mount consumes no Spaces and costs Cr250, while a ring mount costs Cr750. A weapon of up to 500 kg may be attached to them.

It must be specified which arc a pintle mount fires into from the vehicle, and once this is selected it cannot be changed.

Pintle and ring mounts may be fitted with a gun shield to protect the Traveller using it. This costs Cr1000 and provides an additional amount of Protection to the Traveller equal to the TL of the vehicle against all attacks originating from the fire arc the mount is currently facing.

GUN PORT A gun port is a small slot with an armored hatch that allows a Traveller inside the vehicle to use a pistol or rifle to attack targets outside.

A gun port consumes no Spaces and costs Cr250. It must be specified which arc the gun port fires into from the vehicle, and once this is selected it cannot be changed.

BAY A bay is an internal space designed to hold one-shot ordnance such as bombs, missiles, and torpedoes.

## SECTION 1: WEAPON MOUNTS

FIXED MOUNT A fixed mount is a rigid support for a weapon, with no ability to traverse or change aiming point relative to the vehicle it is attached to. Most fixed mounts face forward and are activated by the pilot or driver, though there is no mechanical reason why they cannot be mounted in any direction.

Fixed mounts have no additional cost and consume no extra Spaces (beyond the weapons they are mounting). However, it must be specified which arc they fire into from the vehicle, and once this is selected it cannot be changed.

Fixed mounts may also be used to mount drones (see page 66) which can then be launched directly from the vehicle. This again consumes no Spaces but a vehicle may not mount drones that total more than 25% of the vehicle's own total Spaces.

PINTLE MOUNT/RING MOUNT A pintle mount is simply a post with the weapon fixed upon it while a ring mount is normally found near a hatch. A pintle mount allows the Traveller to pivot the weapon across an entire fire arc, while a ring mount can pivot into any arc, allowing the weapon to fire at targets that would not lie in front of a fixed mount. However, they do require a separate gunner to operate.

TURRET?

A bay costs Cr2500 per Space of weapons it is designed to hold, and can fire one such weapon every round.

Multi-bays capable of firing any number of weapons each round cost Cr5000 per Space of weapons they are designed to hold.

HARD POINT A hardpoint is an external mounting point for one-shot ordnance such as bombs and missiles. The main benefit of hardpoints is that any weapons mounted upon them do not consume Spaces inside the vehicle.

Hardpoints cost Cr2000 per Space of weapon they are designed to hold, and a vehicle can carry weapons totalling a maximum of a quarter of its Spaces in this way.

SMALL TURRET A weapon mounted in a turret can traverse a full 360o and thus attack a target in any arc. A small turret is a simple pod that contains only the weapon and any electronics required to fire it, controlled from a remote station within the vehicle.

A small turret costs Cr10000 for every Space of installed weaponry, plus the cost of the weapons installed, and consumes one Space within the vehicle itself.

A small turret can hold up to 4 Spaces of weapons.

LARGE TURRET A large turret can mount much bulkier weapons and has enough space within for crew to operate it.

A large turret costs Cr25000 for every Space of installed weaponry, plus the cost of the weapons installed, and consumes four Spaces within the vehicle itself, plus one Space for each crewman the turret can contain (small turrets are effectively 'bolted on', while large turrets are considered to be integral parts of the vehicle).

POP-UP MOUNT Any mount can be concealed within a vehicle until required. This is typically done in order to gain surprise on an enemy or to avoid cursory checks from discovering illegal weaponry.

A pop-up mount consumes a number of Spaces equal to the original mount (minimum of 1 Space) and costs an additional Cr10000 per Space.

MODULAR MOUNT Any mount can be made modular, allowing a variety of weapons to be fitted. This allows a vehicle to change its 'mission profile' and become effective against different enemies.

A modular mount will increase the cost of a mount by an additional +50%.

Changing a weapon on a modular amount requires a Routine (6+) Mechanics check (1D minutes, INT or EDU).

The following weapons are specifically designed to be mounted on vehicles. Unless otherwise specified, all ranges are in kilometers.

#### BOLT THROWER

At lower Tech Levels, this is effectively a giant crossbow, using either tension or torsion to fire heavy bolts the size of spears at enemy infantry and cavalry. As the technology becomes available, this is likely to be changed to compressed air. The listed range is in meters.

The Traveller supplement, Central Supply Catalogue, contains a wealth of weapons that can be attached to a vehicle, giving a vehicle designer a huge range of options. Of particular interest will be the Heavy Weaponry chapter.

The only conversion that will be necessary is to turn the Mass of each weapon
(usually listed in Kg or tons) into Spaces. This is done at a rate of 1 Space for every 250 Kg or 0.25 tons of Mass or part of.

So, for example, a light autocannon has a Mass of 0.25 tons, which is equal to 1 Space. An orbital defence cannon has a Mass of 35 tons, which is equal to a whopping 140 Spaces!

THE CENTRAL SUPPLY CATALOGUE

### SECTION 4

SPACECRAFT WEAPONS

In the interests of maximum destructive power, there have been many warlords and vehicle designers who have looked at the practical applications of mounting spacecraft scale weapons onto vehicles. They have enjoyed mixed successes, but the effect is always destructive, to say the least.

Any spacecraft weapon (see High Guard for a full range) can, in theory, be mounted upon a vehicle. In order to do this, a vehicle needs two things – enough room to physically fit the weapon and sufficient power to operate it.

To place a spacecraft weapon into a vehicle, simply multiply the tonnage of the weapon by four. This is how many Spaces it will consume, to a minimum of 1 Space. Unless it is to be placed in a fixed mount, it will also need a spacecraft style turret which, at one ton on a spacecraft, will mean another 4 Spaces is required.

Any vehicle of TL15 or below will require a dedicated fusion plant (see page 49) to provide enough power to use a spacecraft weapon. Vehicles of TL16 are assumed to be able to produce power in sufficient quantities to not require an additional plant.

Jet Engines Jet engines evolve as the technology behind them changes, and the following is a good guide as to what is possible.

TL Engine Type 5 Turbojet, Ramjet 6 High Bypass Turbofan 7 Scramjet 8 Air-Breathing Rocket 9 Waverider 10 MHD Electrojet

Once a weapon has been installed upon a vehicle, it may be given extra ammunition capacity or advanced fire control systems to increase its effectiveness.

LINKED WEAPONS So long as space permits, it is possible to attach multiple weapons to a single mount (be it pintle, fixed, turret, or whatever), so long as they are of the same type. This is called linking (or sometimes twin-linking, as weapons are often mounted in pairs).

If weapons of the same type are linked in this way, only one attack roll is made for all of them. If they successfully hit a target, only one damage roll is made for them, but they add +1 per damage dice to the total damage dealt to the target for every extra weapon.

This bonus has already been factored into the vehicles described in this book.

Note that in the case of Destructive weapons, this bonus is added before the damage is multiplied (making a twin-linked Destructive weapon truly terrifying!).

### SECTION 5

OFFENSIVE CUSTOMISATION

#### AMMUNITION

Vehicles are capable of carrying a great deal of ammunition for their weapons, allowing them to operate for extended periods in the field without a constant requirement to rearm.

Each Space set aside for ammunition allows an extra magazine (as defined by the weapon's own entry) to be directly attached to a weapon, allowing it to be used without the need to reload. These Spaces have no cost other than the ammunition that fills them.

Weapons of less than 1 ton in mass may have up to ten extra magazines for every Space dedicated to ammunition in this way.

Ammunition may also be carried within any spare cargo space, but this will require the reloading of the weapon before it can be used, a process that typically takes 1D or 1D x 10 minutes, depending on the size of the weapon.

#### FIRE CONTROL

The use of fire control systems allows weapons to be targeted far more accurately. This can range from simple gyrostabilization to laser-rangefinders and integration of the vehicle's own advanced sensor arrays to the weapon systems. However, due to their cost and complexity, fire control systems are normally fitted only to a vehicle's primary weapons.

All fire control systems grant the Scope trait to the weapon they are attached to (see page 133 of the Traveller Core Rulebook).

# CUSTOMISATION

THEVEHICLE HANDBOOK COLLECTION

There are many mechanics and engineers throughout the galaxy who believe that the customization of vehicles is an art unto itself. Any vehicle can be modified, either by the simple addition of a few pieces of equipment or a fundamental re-shaping and redesign of the core chassis, for reasons of performance, capability or pure aesthetics

FUEL CAPACITY A vehicle can have its Range decreased or extended simply by adding or removing fuel from its structure.

A vehicle can have its Range increased by 25% at a cost of 10% of its Spaces. This may be done multiple times.

A vehicle can have its Range decreased by 25%. Each time this is done, it gains 1 Space for every full 10 Spaces it started with. This may be done multiple times. If the vehicle is less than 10 Spaces in size, it cannot use this customization.

### PERFORMANCE

At the heart of customization is the idea of increased performance, whether this is making the vehicle faster, more economical or more durable.

SPEED A vehicle can be equipped with more powerful motive systems, lightened or made more aerodynamic – any of these have the potential to increase its raw speed. Alternatively, a vehicle can be given less powerful drive systems in an effort to keep its cost down.

A vehicle can have its Speed increased by one Speed band at a cost of 10% of its Spaces, and doubling its Cost per Space. This may be done multiple times.

A vehicle can have its Speed decreased by one Speed band. Each time this is done, it gains 1 Space for every full 10 Spaces it started with, and has its Cost per Space reduced by 10%. If the vehicle is less than 10 Spaces in size, it receives the cost reduction but not the extra Spaces. This may be done multiple times.

FUEL EFFICIENCY Instead of gaining or losing valuable space to fuel capacity, a vehicle can be made to run more or less efficiently simply by selecting the right components.

A vehicle can have its Range increased by 50% by adding 25% to its Cost per Space. This may be done multiple times.

A vehicle can have its Range decreased by 25% by deducting 10% from its Cost per Space. This may be done multiple times.

STRUCTURAL REINFORCEMENT The use of better quality materials or advanced construction methods can make a vehicle much tougher and resilient to damage.

A vehicle can increase its Hull by +10%, by increasing its Cost per Space by +50%. This may be done once.

Although it is rarely done intentionally, a vehicle can be weakened by using poorer quality materials or just tolerating shoddy construction. A vehicle can decrease its Hull by -25%, by decreasing its Cost per Space by
-25%. This may be done once.

CONTROL SYSTEMS Enhanced control systems can be installed within a vehicle to increase its effective agility. This is usually achieved by the use of drive-by-wire or drive-by-light systems and heads up displays or, on more advanced vehicles, physical linkages that translate body movements or even thoughts into commands. They may also require substantial changes to a vehicle's design in terms of aerodynamics, power source and motive systems.

Note that primitive control systems actually reduce a vehicle's total cost, while basic control systems are assumed to be automatically included in every vehicle unless another option is chosen from this table.

DRIVE SYSTEMS Every vehicle has its own way of moving, but alternative methods can be added to greatly increase a vehicle's utility in the field.

### AUTOPILOT

An autopilot system is a device that, at its most basic, holds a vehicle to a set heading and speed though more advanced models can navigate at least as well as any Traveller. Early autopilots are only of use on aircraft and waterborne vessels but, from TL9 onwards, become effective for any vehicle and will automatically tie themselves into any local traffic control systems.

The Autopilot table shows the range of autopilots available, along with their effective skill level, as appropriate to the vehicle they are installed within (Drive, Flyer, or Seafarer).

Autopilot TL Cost Skill Level Basic 5 Cr2000 0 Improved 7 Cr7500 1 Enhanced 9 Cr10000 2 Advanced 11 Cr15000 3

#### AQUATIC DRIVE

This can be added to a vehicle to allow it to traverse across the surface of water. This does not make it seaworthy but it will be capable of navigating rivers, lakes and coastal areas. The modification includes waterproofing, snorkels and props or water jets for propulsion.

Light vehicles will have the same movement rates as boats
(see page 20) of the same TL, though their Agility while afloat will be one less and Range 10% of that of a boat.

Heavy vehicles will have the same movement rates as ships (see page 21) of the same TL, though their Agility while afloat will be one less and Range 10% of that of a boat.

Aquatic drives add +50% to a vehicle's Cost per Space.

AUXILIARY GRAV DRIVE Any vehicle can be fitted with an auxiliary grav drive, allowing it to fly for short distances.

While flying, the vehicle will have its Agility reduced by
-1, its Range halved, and Speed reduced by one band.

Auxiliary Grav Drives add +100% to a vehicle's Cost per Space and consume 25% of the vehicle's total Spaces
(rounding up).

#### TL4

TL7

TL9

06/29861

AUXILIARY THRUSTERS TL4 Any vehicle can be fitted with auxiliary thrusters, allowing it to 'jump' for short distances.

Instead of moving normally in a round, the vehicle can instead make a short jump.

For every 5% (rounding up) of a vehicle's total Spaces consumed by Auxiliary Thrusters, the vehicle will be able to make a vertical jump of 10 meters. Any forward momentum the vehicle had before jumping will be retained (allowing it to jump horizontally so long as it has had a run up). This will cost Cr10000 per Space.

GROUND DRIVE Many aerial vehicles will be equipped with a simple set of wheels that allow them to maneuver at an airport or spaceport. A ground drive, however, fully converts them into road-going vehicle. Due to the rigours of travel on the ground where collisions are far more frequent, this can be an extremely extensive conversion where the exterior of the vehicle actually 'transforms' between aerial and ground travel.

Light vehicles will have the same movement rates as light ground vehicles (see page 14) of the same TL, though their Agility while on the ground will be one less and Range 50% of that of a light ground vehicle.

Heavy vehicles will have the same movement rates as heavy ground vehicles (see page 15) of the same TL, though their Agility while on the ground will be one less and Range 50% of that of a heavy ground vehicle.

Ground drives add +20% to a vehicle's Cost per Space.

SMART WHEELS Smart wheels use short-raged sensors to constantly scan the ground ahead, and then reshape themselves to compensate. On rough terrain, smart wheels provide DM+1 to any Drive (wheel) checks made to negotiate adverse conditions, while on roads they increase the Range of a vehicle by 10%.

Smart wheels cost Cr1000 per Space of the vehicle, but consume no Spaces themselves.

POWER SYSTEMS Every vehicle comes with a power system installed, even if that power is derived from the wind, animals or the crew themselves. However, vehicles can be customised to use other sources of power that greatly extend their utility.

EXTERNAL POWER This customization allows a vehicle to draw power from an external source, such as overhead wires, induction plates buried under roads or beamed microwaves.

So long as the vehicle has direct access to the external power source (remaining on the road or within line of sight of the microwave transmitter, for instance), it effectively has an unlimited Range.

The External Power table shows how much this costs depending on the total number of Spaces the vehicle has, and how many Spaces it will consume within the vehicle as a percentage of the total number of Spaces.

**06/98746 FISSION PLANT** This is a self-contained and (mostly) safe nuclear reactor that allows a vehicle to run for hugely extended periods of time.

The Fission Plant table shows how much a reactor costs by Tech Level, how many Spaces it consumes as a percentage of a vehicle's total number of Spaces, and how long a vehicle can run without refuelling. A fission plant requires a vehicle to possess the Hostile Environment customization (see page 55). In theory, a vehicle can be equipped with a fission plant without this protection but crew turnover will be much higher.

ACTIVE DEFENCE Armor is the primary defence for many combat vehicles, but a range of customizations are available to increase the protection of a vehicle. After all, it is better to not have to rely upon armor at all rather than risk it being breached.

Advanced systems are capable of shooting down any solid projectile, including shells and bullets. They remain ineffective against energy-based weapons.

All anti-missile systems can be used under manual control as ordinary vehicle-based weapons.

Anti-Missile Systems Anti-Missile System Defence Roll DM Minigun +0 Laser +1 Gauss +2 Advanced Laser +4

**ANTI-MISSILE SYSTEM** These automated systems are capable of tracking incoming missiles and grenades, then destroy them in mid-flight before they can reach the vehicle. This is typically done with very rapid-firing but small calibre miniguns, replaced by gauss and then laser weapons as they become viable.

Anti-missile systems will automatically destroy an incoming missile or grenade on a 2D roll of 8+, with a DM appropriate to their type shown on the Anti-Missile Systems table. DM-1 is applied to every additional incoming attack made in the same round. Anti-missile systems fire extremely rapidly and consume huge amounts of ammunition. Every time an anti-missile system fires, it will consume ammunition equal to ten times its Auto score.

DECOY DISPENSER Decoy dispensers throw out either hot flares or scores of reflective strips (chaff) to confuse and disrupt the targeting of guided weapons. Dispensers intended for use underwater typically use acoustic signatures to trick incoming attacks.

Smart weapons targeting a vehicle equipped with a decoy dispenser suffer DM-2 to their attack rolls.

However, decoy dispensers are completely ignored by Smart weapons that are of a higher TL than the vehicle they are attacking. In addition, decoy dispensers of TL7 or less will only apply their DM if the crew of the vehicle are aware that the attack has been made.

TL Spaces Cost Decoy Dispenser 5 1 Cr2500

ELECTROSTATIC ARMOR This generates a powerful static field around a vehicle, vaporising any objects that come close. This field extends 1-5 meters from the vehicle's exterior and is intended to vaporise shells and missiles before they strike the vehicle's actual hull.

Electrostatic armor provides an additional amount of Protection equal to three times the TL of the vehicle it is installed within.

However, this Protection can only be applied to projectile weapons (such as bullets, shells, and missiles), and never to energy-based weapons. In addition, it can easily be overwhelmed, and will only provide this Protection to one attack every round. This increases by one extra attack per round for every TL above 9.

A further drawback is that an active field is extremely harmful to Travellers and animals. Any living creature moving into the field will suffer 6D damage.

Electrostatic armor consumes 10% of a vehicle's total number of Spaces.

TL Cost Electrostatic Armor 9 Cr10000

NUCLEAR DAMPER The nuclear damper projects a wave that modifies the strong nuclear force which can prevent the detonation of nuclear weapons, or at least remove a lot of their secondary effects.

A vehicle equipped with a nuclear damper ignores the Radiation trait of any weapon that damages it. Furthermore, it will prevent the detonation of any nuclear weapon within 1 km with a successful Difficult
(10+) Electronics (sensors) check (INT or EDU). This check can be performed as a reaction.

A nuclear damper consumes 12 Spaces.

TL Cost Nuclear Damper 12 MCr0.5

PRISMATIC AEROSOL DISCHARGER Similar to a smoke discharger, a prismatic aerosol is a cloud of very fine crystal shards that refract and deflect laser light.

Attacks with laser-based weapons made against a vehicle using a prismatic aerosol discharger will have their damage reduced by 2D. It has no effect upon Destructive weapons or any weapons that do not use lasers.

A prismatic aerosol discharger will have no effect upon a moving vehicle or when in anything stronger than a moderate breeze.

**06/45783 REACTIVE ARMOR** This is a set of small explosive charges positioned on critical areas of a vehicle's exterior that automatically detonate when struck by a weapon.

This provides a bonus to the Protection of a vehicle's armor, but it will degrade over successive hits as the explosives are expended. The bonus is reduced by -1 by each successful hit.

Reactive armor will provide no additional Protection against, and will be completely destroyed by, any hits from Destructive or Spacecraft scale weapons.

The cost of reactive armor is based upon the total number of Spaces of the vehicle it is installed upon though it consumes no Spaces itself. It costs Cr2000 to replace each lost point of Protection gained from reactive armor.

Reactive Armor TL Cost per Space Protection Basic 7 Cr1000 +15 Improved 9 Cr2500 +25 Advanced 11 Cr5000 +30

SMOKE DISCHARGER A smoke discharger simply wreathes a stationary vehicle in smoke, making visual targeting extremely difficult.

Attacks made against a vehicle using a smoke discharger suffer DM-2. However, a smoke discharger will have no effect upon a moving vehicle or when in anything stronger than a moderate breeze.

TL Spaces Cost Smoke Discharger 3 1 Cr1000

ELECTRONICS A vehicle can be enhanced in many ways with the installation of electronic devices and computers. In advanced military machines, this becomes essential for their function.

#### COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS

A functioning communications system allows a vehicle to communicate with the outside world, potentially linking into a planetary-wide network that can greatly increase its range.

Communications Systems TL Cost Range Basic 5 Cr700 50 km Improved 8 Cr75 500 km Advanced 12 Cr250 1000 km

Communications systems can have the following customizations added.

**Encrypted (TL6):** The ability to send and decode encrypted signals means communications can be made secure even if it is likely they will be intercepted. Encryption costs Cr4000.

### Increased Range

Every time the Range of a communications system is multiplied by ten, its initial cost will be doubled. This can be done twice.

Meson Communicator (TL10): A communications system capable of using meson technology cannot be jammed
(in theory it is possible to block a meson signal with a meson screen, but being able to place one in exactly the right spot is likely to be impossible). A meson communicator consumes 2 Spaces and costs Cr50000.

Satellite Uplink (TL6): This allows a communications system to communicate with a satellite or ship in orbit. It includes the necessary tracking equipment to stay locked onto the target, which consumes 1 Space. A satellite uplink costs Cr1000.

Tightbeam (TL8): This adds a separate mode for transmitting and receiving, utilising lasers or masers instead of radio to provide point-to-point communications. This requires line of sight to the target but is nearly impossible to intercept. Tightbeam costs Cr2000.

COMPUTERS 06/65417 The addition of a computer in a vehicle can allow it to perform many different functions other than carrying its crew from one place to another. These computers are very similar to those Travellers may carry about their person but their integration into the vehicle's existing systems brings an additional cost. Computers consume no Spaces on a vehicle.

Any computer of TL8 or more can also act as a communications system if this is specified at purchase. This does not increase the cost of the computer.

A computer can be designed for a specific purpose, which gives it a Processing score of +1 or +2 higher for that software only. The navigation computer used in a specialized ATV, for example, might only be a Computer/1, but could run the Navigation/3 program because it is specially designed for that task. A specialized computer costs 25% more per point of added Processing power – so, a Computer/1, Navigation/3 vehicle computer costs 150% of the cost of a basic Computer/1. At TL8 this would be Cr750.

Processing TL Cost Computer/0 7 Cr1000 Computer/1 8 Cr500 Computer/2 10 Cr1000 Computer/3 12 Cr2000 Computer/4 13 Cr3000 Computer/5 14 Cr10000

ELECTRONIC COUNTERMEASURES A vehicle equipped with electronic countermeasures is capable of disrupting both communications and attempts to use sensors to detect it. In the case of the latter, it will be obvious the vehicle is in the vicinity as electronic countermeasures are an active broadcast, but they will interfere with attempts to pinpoint or analyse the vehicle. Electronic countermeasures cannot be used at the same time as stealth (see page 55).

Electronic countermeasures apply a negative DM to Electronics (comms or sensors) checks equal to the difference between their TL and that of the device they are trying to jam or disrupt. They will have no effect on devices of a higher TL, nor can they be combined with Stealth.

Improved and enhanced versions apply additional negative DMs. The Range of electronic countermeasures can be increased. Every time its Range is multiplied by ten, its cost will be doubled. This can be done twice.

Electronic countermeasures consume 1 Space.

Electronic Countermeasures TL Cost Range

Electronics DM Basic 5 Cr10000 1 km - Improved 8 Cr20000 5 km -1 Advanced 11 Cr40000 25 km -2

Interception and Encryption If a referee deems it possible for a Traveller to intercept a communications signal not intended for them, this may be done with an Average (8+) Electronics (comms) check (INT or EDU). However, intercepting a signal is one thing – if it is encrypted, uncovering the signal's content may be very tricky.

To decrypt an encrypted signal requires a Formidable
(14+) Electronics (comms) check (1D seconds), INT or EDU). For every TL the Traveller's communication system is above that of the transmitting communications system, DM+1 is applied. However, for every TL their communications system is below, DM-1 is applied instead.

This means high TL encrypted transmissions can be impossible to decrypt, even if a great deal of time can be spent trying to crack them.

NAVIGATION SYSTEMS Navigation systems, fundamentally, allow the crew of a vehicle know where they are and what direction they need to go in. At their most basic, navigation systems may provide simple readings based on altitude and magnetic compasses, but they rapidly expand into fully functioning devices that draw information from installed databases, satellite transmissions and the vehicle's own sensors to completely map out their immediate environment.

The Navigation Systems table shows the range of navigation systems available, along with the DM they provide to Navigation checks

### SENSORS

Most basic vehicles rely on a Traveller's own eyes and ears to detect objects in their vicinity, aided only by a clear windscreen and headlights. However, as the Tech Level increases, sensors can become incredibly sophisticated even on relatively basic civilian vehicles.

Sensor Systems TL Cost Range

Electronics
(sensors) DM Basic 5 Cr5000 1 km +0 Improved 7 Cr15000 5 km +1 Advanced 13 Cr25000 25 km +2

Sensor systems can have the following customizations added.

Hardened (TL7): Sensor systems capable of burning through jamming and disruption can be installed into a vehicle. These systems ignore DM-1 of any penalty applied to them from jamming. This will double their initial cost.

Increased Fidelity (TL6): Far more sensitive sensor systems can be installed, making detection of objects

far more likely. For each additional DM+1 to be applied to the Electronics (sensors) check, the sensor system will double its initial cost and consume one Space.

### Increased Range

Every time the Range of a sensor system is multiplied by ten, its initial cost will be doubled. This can be done up to three times.

### Sensor Mast

A sensor mast allows a vehicle to use its sensors from behind cover so only the mast is visible, allowing the vehicle itself to remain hidden or, at least, out of direct line of sight from attacks. This is achieved by the use of physical masts, floating balloons or buoys, or tethered grav platforms. A sensor mast doubles the initial cost of a sensor system.

### Underwater Sensors

A sensor system can be built for underwater use. Note that a sensor system cannot be used for both below and above water, and vehicles wishing to have both capabilities will require two separate sensor systems. Underwater sensors have their Range halved and initial cost doubled.

STEALTH AND CAMOUFLAGE Just as vehicle designers create ever more inventive and sophisticated sensor systems to detect potential hazards and enemies, they have counterparts who work to hide vehicles from detection.

### CAMOUFLAGE

Camouflage is designed to hide a vehicle from visual detection, usually through means of colour schemes that blend into specific environments or by breaking up a vehicle's outline. This generally means it is only applied against Recon checks, though sensors that specifically use visual means of detection (including infrared) may be affected at the referee's discretion.

Camouflage has a minimum Range at which it will work and will only apply in a specific type of environment
(woodland, iron oxide desert, swamp, for example).

At TL7, camouflage will include infrared masking and will apply its DM against detection attempts that use infrared.

At TL12, multi-chromatic camouflage becomes available, allowing the vehicle to effectively change colour to suit its current environment.

The basic cost of any camouflage system is multiplied by the number of Spaces a vehicle has, though it consumes no Spaces itself.

#### STEALTH

While camouflage helps a vehicle hide from visual detection, stealth allows it to evade detection by advanced sensors. As the TL of wars increases, stealth steadily becomes more important than camouflage – in short, camouflage will not help hide a vehicle from radar or more advanced sensors, while stealth will not hide a vehicle from the Mk1 eyeball. Stealth is achieved through passive means, mainly through the use of advanced materials and design, and cannot be used at the same time as electronic countermeasures (see page 52).

Stealth applies a negative DM to Electronics (comms or sensors) checks equal to the difference between the vehicle's TL and that of the device it is trying to evade.

Stealth has no effect on devices of a higher TL, nor can it be combined with Electronic Countermeasures.

Improved and enhanced versions apply additional negative DMs.

The basic cost of stealth is multiplied by the number of Spaces a vehicle has, though it consumes no Spaces itself.

Stealth TL Cost Electronics (sensors) DM Basic 7 Cr5000 -1 Improved 9 Cr10000 -2 Advanced 13 Cr20000 -4

ENVIRONMENTAL CUSTOMISATION While many vehicles are designed for everyday civilian use on temperate worlds, others have to cope with truly hostile environments on planets where the atmosphere itself is capable of corroding a vehicle into a hunk of rusted metal within days or even hours.

#### AIRLOCK

A vital component to most environmental customizations, an airlock allows crew and passengers to enter and exit the vehicle without compromising any internal environment.

TL Spaces Cost Airlock 6 2 Cr2000

CORROSIVE ENVIRONMENT The vehicle is modified through the use of ceramics and corrosion-resistant materials to withstand corrosive atmospheres. It includes all the benefits of the hostile environment customization, and must be combined with life support to be effective. The cost is based on the total number of Spaces of the vehicle.

TL Spaces Cost Corrosive Environment 9 - Cr10000

#### HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT

This is a series of modifications that safeguards both vehicle and crew in dangerous environments. This includes protection against both heat and cold, radiation (protection equal to 500 rads), poisons and bacterial threats. It must be combined with life support to be effective. The cost is based on the total number of Spaces of the vehicle.

TL Spaces Cost Hostile Environment 6 - Cr5000

INSIDIOUS ENVIRONMENT Some atmospheres are so destructive that they will eventually breach any defence, no matter how sophisticated it is. This customization is not a permanent solution but it provides protection against such environments for a number of days equal to the TL of the vehicle. After this time has elapsed, the vehicle loses its protection against insidious environments until the vehicle is completely refurbished, a process taking 1D days in a fully-equipped workshop and costing 5% of the total cost of the vehicle.

It includes all the benefits of the hostile environment customization, and must be combined with life support to be effective. The cost is based on the total number of Spaces of the vehicle.

LIFE SUPPORT Even if a vehicle is capable of surviving a hostile environment, there is no guarantee that its crew and passengers can. Life support systems provide a sealed environment within the vehicle and a breathable atmosphere independent to that outside.

Short term life support systems provide this habitat for up to four days before air and filters need replacing
(included as part of the vehicle's regular maintenance costs). It consumes one Space for every 20 people (or part of) on board the vehicle).

Long term life support operates for up to 90 days and consumes 1 Space for every 5 people on board.

TL Cost per Space Life Support (short term) 4 Cr10000 Life Support (long term) 7 Cr50000

VACUUM PROTECTION This seals the vehicle against vacuum, allowing crew and passengers to operate freely in regions with no atmosphere. It includes all the benefits of the hostile environment customization, and must be combined with life support to be effective. The cost is based on the total number of Spaces of the vehicle.

TL Spaces Cost per Space Vacuum Protection 6 - Cr10000

CREATURE COMFORTS AND UTILITY The customization options in this section are rarely essential to most vehicles and the roles they are expected to perform. However, they may be vital for some specialized operations or, indeed, may simply be used to make the lives of the Traveller's riding within them more comfortable or interesting.

ATMOSPHERIC SAMPLER This is a system of collectors, pipes and filters used for atmospheric sampling, including particulates, taints and organic matter. An Electronics (sensors) check will be required to gain any useful information.

An atmospheric sampler consumes 3 Spaces and costs Cr10000.

### AUTODOC

An autodoc is a small self-contained diagnostic, pharmaceutical, and surgical system about the size of a low berth chamber or large coffin. It is capable of diagnosing and treating disease, infection, injuries and other medical conditions as efficiently as a qualified doctor (treat as Medic 3).

At TL14, an autodoc is capable of reanimation, provided no more than 2D minutes have passed since the Traveller's death. This period can be doubled by extremely cold conditions or extended up to 1D days by placing the Traveller's corpse in a low berth.

Item TL Spaces Cost Autodoc 13 2 Cr100000 Autodoc 14 2 MCr1

#### COMMAND CENTRE

Used in military, law enforcement and rescue vehicles, a command center allows the effective monitoring and co-ordination of units in high stress operations. The command center includes workstations and a large screen or holographic table for reports and displays. Up to two Travellers can use a command center at any one time, and it can be increased in size, consuming 1 Space and costing Cr5000 for each extra Traveller. A command center requires a vehicle to have at least TL8 communications systems and Improved Sensors.

Item TL Spaces Cost Command Centre 9 4 Cr75000

CRANE A crane is a gantry that can be folded to lie flush in line with the vehicle's chassis or within it. Fitted with lifting equipment, cranes are used to move heavy loads within reach of the vehicle.

#### CRYOBERTH

A cryoberth, or 'icebox' is a coffin-like machine similar to the low or frozen berths used on spacecraft. The main difference is that a cryoberth works much faster than a low berth, freezing and preserving its occupant almost instantly. A cryoberth can therefore be used to place a severely injured Traveller into stasis until he receives medical treatment. A cryoberth's internal power system can function for up to one week on its own batteries, but a berth is usually connected to the vehicle's power supply.

Item TL Spaces Cost Cryoberth 10 1 Cr50000

CUTTING TOOL The nature of this heavy-duty external cutting tool will vary depending on the Tech Level of the vehicle it is mounted upon, but can range from chainsaws and water knives to plasma cutters.

A cutting tool consumes 5 Spaces and costs Cr10000.

#### DIGGER BLADE

This is a large external blade used for digging and scooping, utilising the vehicle's mass and power to move far greater quantities of material than would be possible by a Traveller alone.

A digger blade consumes 10 Spaces and costs Cr25000.

EJECTION COCOON Similar to an ejection seat, the cocoon is a lightly- armored shell that provides a limited, pressurized environment. It is used in very high-speed aircraft and grav vehicles, where ejection could be dangerous, or when ejection is expected within hostile environments.

An ejection cocoon consumes 3 Spaces for each crew member and costs Cr10000 per Space.

#### EJECTION SEAT

Ejection seats are designed to blast a Traveller clear of a vehicle in demise, then deploy a parachute to bring him safely to the ground. An ejection seat can be triggered as a reaction, but those of TL6 or below require the vehicle
(usually an aircraft) to be at an altitude of at least 500 meters. High TL ejection seats use grav chutes to bring the Traveller to rest.

An ejection seat consumes no Spaces and costs Cr5000.

ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM Entertainment in low Tech Level vehicles tend to concentrate on audio facilities but rapidly advance to include visual mediums.

Entertainment systems consume no Spaces and cost Cr200. However, Travellers looking to impress other passengers are free to spend more. A lot more.

FIRE EXTINGUISHERS Fire Extinguishers are designed to put out fires internal to the vehicle.

If a vehicle catches fire (perhaps after being attacked by a weapon with the Fire trait), the extinguisher can be activated as a reaction. For the next 1D rounds, roll 2D. On an 8+, the fire is put out.

Fire extinguishers consume no Spaces and cost Cr500 per 25 Spaces the vehicle has.

FRESHER A fresher provides hygienic services on board a vehicle and comes complete with toilet, sink and shower. It consumes 2 Spaces and costs Cr1500.

A large fresher can be installed instead, and is a full- sized washroom, complete with tub, shower, vanity with sink, toilet and bidet. This consumes 6 Spaces and costs Cr5000.

GALLEY A galley provides food preparation and serving facilities on board a vehicle, though extra space must be provided if a separate eating area is required.

A mini-galley consumes 2 Spaces, serves up to 5 Travellers and costs Cr1000. A full galley consumes 6 Spaces, plus 1 Space per 10 Travellers served. It costs Cr2000 plus Cr100 per Traveller served.

GENERAL PURPOSE LABORATORY This laboratory provides no bonuses to scientific checks but allows tasks to be performed with no penalty for missing tools or equipment.

A general purpose laboratory consumes 2 Spaces per Traveller using it and cost Cr5000 per Space.

GEOLOGICAL SAMPLER This is an array of scooping devices designed for shallow ground testing, along with a hollow-core drills capable of drilling down one kilometer. An Electronics (sensors) check will be required to gain any useful information.

A geological sampler consumes 15 Spaces and costs Cr100000.

HOLDING TANK A holding tank is a sealed enclosure equipped with long-duration life support system. The holding tank can recreate different atmospheres and can draw in, compress and store a local planetary atmospheric sample in order to sustain any lifeforms held within the tank.

Holding tanks can be built to any size, at the cost of Cr5000 per Space.

HOLO-SUITE This is an advanced holographic projection suite. Often used on exploration vehicles as a large display unit, it has other, less wholesome, uses.

A holo-suite consumes 1 Space and costs Cr15000.

HOT TUB After a long day exploring alien worlds and fighting interstellar wars, there are few things more relaxing for the average Traveller than soaking in a warm water with friends.

A hot tub consumes 1 Space per Traveller intended for its use. By increasing this to 2 or 3 Spaces per Traveller, a hot pool can be created instead. Either way, a hot tub costs Cr3000 per Space.

#### HYDROGRAPHIC SAMPLER

This is a set of liquid sampling devices, holding tanks and testing equipment.

A hydrographic sampler consumes 5 Spaces and costs Cr10000.

INTERNAL BAY Large vehicles are fully capable of carrying smaller vehicles inside. An internal bay does not simply provide the ability to carry another vehicle (which can be achieved simply by dedicating cargo space to the task), but provides enough space to conduct basic maintenance and facilities to launch or deploy the vehicle inside.

An internal bay consumes a number of Spaces equal to twice the Shipping Size of the vehicle to be carried. It costs Cr1000 per Space.

#### LABORATORY

Laboratories include analytic equipment, computer workstations and equipment appropriate to the discipline they specialized for, which must be defined upon installation. Types of laboratory include those specialized for physics, chemistry, biology, psychology, structures and materials, though other types are possible.

A laboratory consumes 1 Space per Traveller using it and grants DM+1 to all Science checks related to its specialization made within it. If this is increased to 2 Spaces per Traveller, it grants DM+2, while 3 Spaces per Traveller grants DM+3. The number of Spaces per Traveller must be defined during installation.

Laboratories cost Cr10000 per Space.

LOW BERTH The low berth is a standard hibernation unit, usually found on spacecraft. In vehicles, they are often part of an emergency response system, where accident victims can be placed into hibernation to prevent their condition from getting worse. Each low berth can hold one Traveller.

A low berth consumes 2 Spaces and costs Cr50000.

#### MANIPULATOR ARM

A manipulator arms is a remote appendage, culminating in a claw or mechanical hand. Manipulator arms vary in STR and DEX, depending on their size and Tech Level.

Manipulator Arm TL STR DEX Spaces Cost Primitive 5 7 2 1 Cr1000 Basic 7 12 4 1 Cr2500 Improved 8 15 7 2 Cr5000 Enhanced 9 15 12 2 Cr10000 Advanced 10 15 15 2 Cr15000

OPERATING THEATRE An operating theatre is a room or chamber equipped for use as an emergency medical clinic. Until TL7, the vehicle must remain stationary in order for the operating theatre to be used. After that, the theatre is built upon a stabilized bed that allows it to be used while the vehicle is in motion.

### REFRIGERATOR

While most Travellers will have their refrigeration needs met by an installed galley or wet bar, larger areas can be designated for refrigeration capacity.

Any amount of Space can be used for refrigeration, but 1 extra Space per 10 Spaces to be refrigerated must be dedicated to the cooling equipment. This costs Cr1500 per Space dedicated in this way.

REFUELLING PLANT A refuelling plant is capable of turning water into hydrogen fuel, using a sun as its power source. It requires a significant amount of space, and access to both water and sun. At TL9, it requires the number of Spaces a vehicle has in hours to crack sufficient fuel to completely refuel the vehicle. At TL12 this is reduced by half.

Refuelling plants consume 4 Spaces plus 1 Space per 25 Spaces of the vehicle it is installed within, and costs Cr 15000 per Space.

### STATEROOM

Similar to the stateroom on board spacecraft (though without many of the advanced facilities) or a small hotel room, a stateroom provides accommodation for one, or two if they do not mind being a little cramped. Space is provided for sleeping and storage of personal items, but a fresher is not included.

A stateroom consumes 10 Spaces and costs Cr100000.

WET BAR This is a basic wet bar, usually species-specific and tailored to the tastes of the vehicle's owner.

A wet bar consumes no Spaces and costs Cr2000.

Power Plants This design system does not go into specifics of power plants. However, this is information that some people like to have and it can flesh out vehicle descriptions.

From TL 3-5, engines are fossil-fuel powered steam engines, either pistons, or towards the end of the period, steam-driven turbine.

With TL 5-6, power plants are generally fossil-fuel or alcohol-powered internal combustion en- gines, either piston or gas turbine, though fuel cells are available towards the end of the period.

From TL 7-9, power plants are improved internal combustion engines and high-efficiency gas turbines, with fuel cells and high-density batteries coming into common use in the latter days of the time period.

AT TL 9-12, fuel cells are very common but at TL 10 they start becoming supplanted in larger vehicles by fusion power plants.

After TL 12, fusion power is ubiquitous, though ultra-dense batteries are also found in many places.

By TL 16, anti-matter is in experimental use on the largest of vehicles.

In settings where compact fusion power is not developed, fuel cells, high-density batteries and MHD turbines are the most common high-tech power plants, typically hydrogen-fuelled.

CHAPTER-SEVEN

THEVEHICLE HANDBOOK COLLECTION

# BIOTECH

The idea of a vehicle that can repair itself, grow its own ammunition and be powered purely by grazing organic material or gathering sunlight sounds like a dream, but this is all possible with bio-technology. These are effectively living vehicles constructed of (or grown from) organic matter and, given a suitable technological base, can rival more traditional vehicles and even exceed some of their capabilities.

USING BIO-TECH Not every universe has or should have bio-technology capable of creating vehicles, and it is up to the referee whether he allows it on the worlds he creates. Bio- technology could be widespread and an accepted part of interstellar society, or it could be a lot rarer in some regions of the galaxy, with perhaps just one race of aliens capable of using it to any great degree. However, even in a galaxy where bio-technology is largely unknown, it can often be fun to throw a vehicle created with these rules at the Travellers, perhaps as a relic from a long past age or as a creation of a minor and relatively unknown alien race.

This chapter assumes a 'typical' Traveller universe where bio-technology is fairly rare but possible.

A bio-tech vehicle under these circumstances requires a society of at least TL10. However, it will always be constructed and function as being two Tech Levels lower. So, for example, a TL10 world could create a bio-tech vehicle that would use a maximum of TL8 components.

In universes where bio-technology is commonplace and well-understood, this Tech Level restriction can be ignored.

**MECHANICS VS. MEDICS** While the technology of bio-tech vehicles is fundamentally different from that of non-organic vehicles, they perform many of the same functions in similar ways and a bright mechanic can often figure out how to fix or modify a bio- tech vehicle, given sufficient time and motivation.

Any Mechanic checks made on a bio-tech vehicle suffer DM-4.

When a bio-tech vehicle needs repair or customization, it can often be more practical to call a doctor! However,

few medical schools teach their students how to perform the equivalent of an oil change on a bio-ATV.

Any Medic checks made on a bio-tech vehicle suffer DM-2.

In universes where bio-technology is commonplace and well-understood, these penalties can be ignored.

DESIGNING BIO-TECH VEHICLES When creating bio-tech vehicles, the design checklist on page 5 is used as normal, as are the choice of chassis types and further customizations. However, the following changes are made.

### Chassis Choice

Light and Heavy Grav vehicles may not be chosen. Note that helicopters are more likely to be ornithopters.

### Agility

An additional +1 is applied to the Agility of bio- tech vehicles.

### Cost per Space

This is doubled for bio-tech vehicles.

### Shipping Size

Bio-tech vehicles tend to be bulkier than their non-organic counterparts. Add 10% (rounding down) to the total number of tons the vehicle requires for shipping.

### Traits

Bio-tech vehicles must select either the Vertebrate or Invertebrate trait, and then either the Ectothermic or Endothermic trait.

BIO-TECH TRAITS The following traits are used for Bio-tech vehicles.

### Ectothermic

This vehicle is 'cold-blooded'. It increases its Range by 25% but reduces its Speed by one Band.

### Endothermic

This vehicle is 'warm-blooded' and grants DM+1 to any IR-based sensors that try to detect them.

### Invertebrate

An Invertebrate vehicle relies on muscles and internal pressure to retain its shape. Invertebrate vehicles reduce their Cost per Space by 25% (after doubling for being a bio-tech vehicle) and reduce their total number of Hits by 10%.

### Vertebrate

These vehicles have an internal skeletal structure which gives them strength and retains their shape. Vertebrate vehicles receive no special rules.

### ARMOR

While the armor used on bio-tech vehicles can prove to be extremely tough, it is generally not quite as capable at resisting damage as non-organic plating.

Maximum armor Protection for any bio-tech vehicle is reduced by 20%.

### CUSTOMISATION

Almost all options listed in the Customization chapter have a bio-tech equivalent and can be used as normal when designing a bio-tech vehicle. Exceptions and changes are noted here.

### Auxiliary Grav Drive

This may not be used in bio-tech vehicles.

### Camouflage and Stealth

Bio-tech vehicles gain an additional DM-1 to be detected by all methods except those using infrared, in which case the sensors being used receive DM+1. Note that all bio-tech vehicles have at least DM-1 to be detected (except for sensors using infrared), even if they have not taken a camouflage or stealth customization.

### Electronic Countermeasures

This may not be used in bio- tech vehicles.

### Environmental Customizations

All such customizations have their cost halved and any duration doubled.

### Meson Communicator

This may not be used in bio- tech vehicles.

### Navigation Systems

Bio-tech versions grant an additional DM+1 to Navigation checks and have their cost halved.

### Sensors

All sensors are doubled in price and have their range halved, except those used underwater. These are still doubled in price but gain DM+2 to all Electronics
(sensors) checks made when using them.

Non-organic & Bio-tech Customization: Enterprising Travellers may try to combine non-organic and bio-tech in their vehicles, either installing bio-tech components into a non-organic vehicle, or vice versa.

While this is entirely possible, it is rarely easy due to the fundamental differences between technologies.

When installing non-organic items into a bio-tech vehicle (or vice versa), quadruple all costs.

BIO-TECH WEAPONRY While non-organic weapons can be mounted upon a bio-tech vehicle, dedicated bio-tech weapons not only have the advantage of direct compatibility, but are also either directly powered by the vehicle's own systems or actually grow their own ammunition. This means that so long as the vehicle is kept refuelled, it will never run out of ammunition.

Bio-tech weapons will regrow any expended ammunition within a day.

This weapon fires an extremely powerful electrical discharge that can blast apart organic matter and penetrate even hardened armor. While short-ranged, it remains extremely potent, especially when mounted on board a stealth-capable bio-tech vehicle.

### BIOLASER

This is a chemical laser weapon, using enhanced bioluminescent proteins as the lasing medium. Even the optical chambers and mirrors are bio-tech in origin, and the biolaser is at least as capable as its non-organic equivalents. Truly massive versions of the biolaser are possible, though they require over-sized bio-tech vehicles to house them

SCYTHING CLAW This weapon takes the form of a massive claw that, by virtue of mass and power, is capable of ripping through the thickest armor with ease. Soldiers have reported vehicles armed with scything claws being able to peel grav tanks apart as if they were tin cans. While it is obviously limited in range, a bio-tech vehicle armed with these claws is a vicious weapon in urban environments or close assaults.

Repairs A damaged bio-tech vehicle can be repaired, though the different technologies involved can make this an expensive process. Double the time and cost to repair a bio-tech vehicle.

However, bio-tech vehicles have the advantage that they are capable of re-growing damaged areas and can effectively repairs themselves, given time.

This squat weapon throws large spores across large distances, where they explode and release deadly spores into the air that quickly infect any organic life forms close by, effectively eating away their flesh in seconds. The spore mortar has no effect on vehicles or Travellers in sealed suits.

SWARM CANNON The swarm cannon grows tiny insects with metallic shells at a hugely increased rate, and then propels them with great speed and in large numbers towards a target. This swarm has the ability to correct its flight, and so all attacks with a swarm cannon gain DM+2 to their attack rolls.

## DRONES

A drone is any vehicle that has no Traveller as a pilot or driver. Drones can be exceptionally versatile, and are usually built either to save space that would otherwise be required for a crew, or because the vehicle is intended for duties in hazardous areas, such as battlefields or hostile environments.

Drones start off as being remotely controlled, usually through radio transmissions sent from a control system, but as they become more advanced, drones become more autonomous. As technologically races ahead, drones first become capable of interpreting and following instructions from their controller (such as finding the best route from point A to point B without constant attention from its controller) but quickly become increasingly sophisticated that they can act fully autonomously. At this point, drones are effectively intelligent robots, albeit ones built within the chassis or hull of a vehicle.

BUILDING A DRONE At its heart, a drone is simply a vehicle that has no crew, using a drone 'brain' instead. Note that this does not mean it cannot carry passengers, just that no on- board control is necessary.

To create a drone, follow all the normal vehicle design rules, as detailed on page 5. When you come to Step 5 on the Design Checklist, you can add passengers as normal but, instead of crew, use one of the control systems presented in this chapter.

#### Remote Controllers

A remote control system requires three components – a
'base station' that includes a communication system through which a Traveller can control the drone, a communications system built into the drone so it can receive the command signals, and an actuation system on board the drone to make actual inputs to its controls
(such as steering the wheels in a car).

ROBOT OR DRONE? The Central Supply Catalogue provides rules for creating robots in Traveller, and referees may find themselves questioning when they should be using robots and when they should be using drones to create new encounters in their games.

This can be treated as a question of taste and what a referee is actually looking for. The robot creation rules are more like guidelines and allow for a huge variety in the type of robot possible. The drones created in this chapter are, in effect, vehicles with a robot brain and have a much more tightly defined design system that easily translates between vehicles and spacecraft.

In general, robots are intended to be close to human- sized or smaller, with a wide range of functions possible. Drones are, generally speaking, larger and (usually) faster, requiring vehicle Speed Bands and damage to properly reflect their capabilities.

However, referees should (as always) handle things as they see fit and with what makes them comfortable. There is no reason a small walker could not be given a drone brain and perform as a humanoid robot, just as a robot using the Central Supply Catalogue rules could not be given a large number of Hits and the Large trait to reflect something massive.

The choice is yours!

#### Base Station

Every base station requires a communications system at its heart, and this can be as simple as the transceivers found on page 103 of the _Traveller Core Rulebook_. Most base stations will employ radio, though there is no reason laser transceivers or other, similar, equipment cannot be used instead (bearing in mind that while a laser transceiver will not be susceptible to jamming or interception, the drone will only receive signals while it is in line of sight of the base station). Also be aware that the communications system used in the base station will define the maximum range at which the drone can receive commands.

The only requirement of the communications system is that it is of at least the same Tech Level as the drone itself.

Once a communications system has been installed, a Traveller will need an interface to accept his commands and send them via the communications system to the drone. These are listed on the Control Interfaces table. The Control DM is the DM applied to any Electronics
(remote ops) checks made to control the drone through the interface.

Control Interfaces Interface TL Mass Control DM Cost Primitive 5 5 -4 Cr1000 Basic 7 1 -2 Cr2000 Improved 9 0.5 +0 Cr10000 Advanced 11 0.5 +1 Cr50000

Instead of using a dedicated interface, any computer with a communications capability can be used to control a drone of the same Tech Level or lower. Note that even the TL8 mobile comm on page 103 of the Traveller Core Rulebook can qualify as a control interface for a drone and, once linked to a planet-wide communications network, can theoretically pilot the drone anywhere on that world.

Computers act as Basic control interfaces.

#### Receiver

In order to receive signals from the control interface, the drone will need a communications system of its own, chosen from those detailed on page 51. Note that any telemetry (whereby the base station can receive signals

from the drone, such as video feeds or performance data) will have a range limited by the communications of the drone not the base station. It is perfectly possible for the drone to be within range of control but be out of range to send any information back.

Actuation System An actuation system simply requires a direct link from the drone's 'brain' to the physical controls of the vehicle. This is usually accomplished through the use of servos and remote linkages, though more advanced systems may replace any physical movement required with form-fitting muscle-like fibre structures.

The actuation system will consume 1 Space for every full 20 Spaces present within the vehicle (so a vehicle of less than 20 Spaces need not dedicate any room to an actuation system), at a cost of Cr1000 per Space used (to a minimum of Cr1000).

Additional Systems Note that it is perfectly possible for drones to receive all the customization options that other vehicles have, such as advanced control systems and autopilots (the latter allowing the drone to travel from point to point without requiring constant attention from the Traveller controlling it).

Robot Brains Advanced drones can be equipped with robot brains, removing the requirement for a controller. When these drones first appear in technological societies, controllers are usually present to supersede decisions the drone makes (especially on military drones equipped with weapons). However, as trust grows in the technology, these drones become increasingly autonomous, making all decisions by themselves once given a task to perform.

A drone with a robot brain can have a remote control system installed but this is not required. They are normally equipped with communications systems so commands can be uploaded during a mission but, again, this is not required if all parameters of their task are pre-programmed by physically accessing the drone before deployment. Obviously, a drone without a communications system cannot be re-programmed after it is launched, which may cause problems if the Travellers suddenly realise it is has been tasked to wipe out the wrong target...

To create this kind of fully autonomous drone, a vehicle simply needs a robot brain installed. The Robot Brains table lists options based on Tech Level. Robot brains consume no Spaces and make any necessary skill checks (such as Drive, Flyer, Heavy Weapons, Recon, etc) at the level shown.

Robots Brains Robot Brain TL Skill Level Cost Basic 8 -1 Cr20000 Advanced 10 0 Cr100000 Very Advanced 12 1 MCr0.5 Self-aware 15 2 MCr1

### Basic

The drone has extremely limited intelligence and focusses purely on its (very precisely) pre- programmed mission. It can avoid obstacles and obvious hazards, but has little ability to otherwise interact with its environment.

### Advanced

The drone has some fair degree of intelligence and can interact with its environment in a way that almost appears sentient. However, the drone will tend to be very literal in its interpretation of its pre-programmed mission and when confronted with an unexpected or unfamiliar situation, may become confused to the point of inaction.

### Very Advanced

This drone is highly intelligent. It is fully capable of communicating with Travellers in a reasoned, logical manner and its responses will suggest it is fully conscious. When confronted with unfamiliar situations that lie beyond the scope of its mission, the robot will be able to reason its way through problems, likely faster than a Traveller.

Self-aware: While not a true artificial intelligence, this drone can make a very good impersonation of it. It can be given very general parameters for any mission and be able to define its own parameters based on experience and what it believes its owners require.

Given the wooden construction and weak armor of galleons, a single volley can be enough to end a battle. Despite its firepower, the galleon also has a respectable cargo hold, though this is often filled with supplies and ammunition for extended voyages.

As militaries progress sufficiently in technology to take advantage of airpower, a wide range of warplanes begin to appear. Most common are patrol or scout aircraft, the forerunners of true fighters. Initially intended to provide aerial reconnaissance, clashes between such aircraft become common as the sky becomes busier, and aircraft are developed to destroy one another. While they can appear (and, indeed, are) very flimsy to more advanced pilots, patrol fighters are the height of technology for the skies they fly in.

The Impala is designed to operate in the forward edge of battle area while avoiding direct confrontation with the enemy. Instead, it uses its advanced sensor systems to detect adversaries and pass on their positions to front line units to be destroyed. In this fashion, it is very much a force multiplier, making armored vehicles and aircraft more effective.

Before the advent of grav technology, supersonic airliners like the Concordia II provide the fastest form of air travel though high ticket prices tend to place them beyond the reach of the common man. However, those who can afford it are in for royal treatment and a transportation system that can get them to anywhere on the planet in a matter of a few short hours. The Concordia II is capable of speeds in excess of Mach 5, though it normally supercruises at around Mach 4.

While the armor of the Dirtside is not intended to deflect the heaviest of anti- tank weaponry, it provides more or less complete immunity to weapons carried by enemy infantry at lower Tech Levels and is overall a great improvement on earlier APCs.

As grav technology becomes prevalent, vehicles incorporate the new method of propulsion but their roles tend to stay the same, whether those roles are still relevant or not. The Skystrike is an example of an early gav vehicle designed to replace jet fighters, and it retains many of the same characteristics. Though primarily intended for air superiority, it is capable of a limited ground attack role. However, pilots will soon become aware that the Skystrike's primary defence is its speed and agility, and not its all too thin composite skin.

Utilising a semi-rigid gas-filled structure, dirigibles provide relatively cheap and efficient (though slow) air travel, along with the capability to land in rough and unprepared areas. However, they are affected a lot more by serious weather

conditions than fixed-winged aircraft and so tend to be found working only as pleasure craft or within atmospheres that prohibit the easy use of other craft.

and crew in the small gondola suspended below the vehicle. The gondola is biologically inert, except for control linkages, for the comfort of human crews. Ten tentacles hang below the main body of the airship, and are used to carry cargo. Propulsion is through an array of flagella that propel the airship like dozens of little propellers. Lift is provided primarily by hydrogen gas, produced by the organism itself using photosynthetic patches, though the vehicle is designed as a lifting body. Archies are not very bright, but are capable of forming loyalties and attachments to long-term crews.

A plasma borer uses a focused stream of plasma to heat and soften the rock face while a more conventional drill head moves into it. A small deep-radar unit on the robot watches for flaws or pockets in the rock, and adjusts the beam accordingly.

standards of fashion, the gunskiff is essentially an open-topped grav platform mounted with a single heavy weapon. It is a cheap and effective way to bring a heavy weapon to bear over a wide area, but its light armor and open nature often means it is best employed against relatively low Tech Level enemies. The flat bed nature of the gunskiff means that if it does not carry passengers, it can easily accommodate one ton of cargo.

Cheap enough to be considered disposable, a squadron of these free-ranging drones can wreak havoc upon an unprepared or lower technologically-advanced enemy, with little to lose should a counterattack destroy them. The Heaven70 does require a remote operator to function at best efficiency but it has a basic robot brain installed, allowing it to work autonomously if required.
