## Other Intelligent Species

Charted Space contains a large number of non–human intelligent species. Some, such as the Jagd–Il–Jagd, are very alien indeed. They are gas giant dwellers and unlikely to be encountered far from their home system of Jagd in Lishun sector. Others share environmental needs with humans and can be encountered on the same worlds or even living in the same communities.

### ASLAN

The first human explorers to encounter this humanoid race thought they looked somewhat lion–like and used the name 'Aslan' (Turkish for lion) to describe them. The label stuck and has been in use ever since, though the similarity is vague and Aslan have no connection with any [[Terra|Terran]] species, let alone the great cats.

The Aslan have a clan–based martial society, with over 4,000 clans making up the Aslan Hierate, a region of space located to Spinward of the main Imperium. Relative to the Spinward Marches, the Hierate lies to Spinward–Coreward across the Great Rift. The Aslan have considerable holdings on this side of the Rift however, and are not uncommon in the Marches.

Aslan society is divided along strict male/female lines. Males are leaders and warriors; females are businesspersons, scientists and technicians. The divide is so ingrained that some Aslan males are unable to understand the concept of money (or so they claim) and will address a female human soldier as male (fighting is a 'male' preserve) or a male scientist as a female (since the individual is in a 'female' role).

Aslan culture holds that only the first son inherits, so landless second sons ( _Ihatei_ ) often go adventuring in search of land and glory. This can lead to friction with neighbors who do not appreciate the activities of the _Ihatei_.

### DROYNE

The Droyne are something of an oddity. They have enclaves scattered all across Charted Space. Some are stone–age primitives while others possess advanced starships mounting fearsome weaponry.

Vaguely humanoid with both reptilian and bird–like features, the Droyne are divided into six castes. Members of different castes have considerably different physical and mental characteristics depending upon their role in Droyne society.

The Droyne never explain their actions. At least, not in a way that makes sense to humans. At times they are quite active, with trade ships visiting many ports and other vessels sighted all over Charted Space. There have been many unexplained lulls in Droyne activity as well.

There are two Droyne worlds in the Marches, Andor and Candory. Both are interdicted by the Imperium. Permits to visit are supposedly available but are very hard to obtain. There are also a few small enclaves on other worlds. Visitors to these places are often completely ignored even if the Droyne communities can be found at all.

### HIVERS

Hivers resemble very large six–armed starfish and communicate visually by waggling their digits. Most wear a device called a Voder, which translates the waggles into Galanglic.

The Hivers are the 'first among equals' (or so they claim) in the Hive Federation, leading a wide assortment of other races. The Federation is far to Trailing–Rimward of the Marches on the far side of Imperial space, with a neutral area in between. Hivers are thus rare in the Marches, though they have been sighted.

### K'KREE

The K'Kree, or Centaurs, also dwell far to Trailing of the Marches across the entire Imperium and also a region of independent space. They are even more rarely seen in the Marches than the Hivers.

K'Kree are militant herbivores who have never made any secret of their 'manifest destiny' to wipe out all meat–eaters in the universe. This puts a strain on relations, though there is some trade and diplomatic contact between the Imperium and the 2000 Worlds of the K'Kree.

### VARGR

Vargr are candidates for the 'Other [[Terra|Terran]]s' label, but as a Major Race they are dealt with here instead. The Vargr were genetically engineered from [[Terra|Terran]] carnivores (the word Vargr means 'Wolf') in the distant past, presumably by the Ancients.

The Vargr dwell mainly to Coreward, in the Vargr Extents. This is a large area of Vargr and mostly–Vargr worlds forming large numbers of great and small polities that rarely remain stable for long. Many Vargr live in the Imperium; they are the second commonest species in the Spinward Marches.

Vargr are pack creatures whose culture and civilization are based around the concept of individuals with 'Charisma'; that is Alpha individuals. Vargr will give their loyalty to charismatic individuals and thus gain reflected glory, but a leader who loses face may find himself without followers rather quickly. Vargr society tends to be somewhat more fluid and turbulent than human civilization, though Vargr are capable of deep loyalty to an individual or ideal that has earned it.
