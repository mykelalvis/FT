# Ine Givar

The Ine Givar is considered to be a terrorist organization but the truth is more complex. The movement began as a peaceful attempt to obtain democratic reform in Imperial territory and still maintains a pro-democracy stance. However, elements of the movement lost patience long ago and began to resort to more dramatic means.

There are, broadly speaking, three philosophies within Ine Givar membership, peaceful reform, honorable struggle and any-means-necessary.  Not all of those taking the latter position support terrorism. Some have aligned themselves with Zhodani or Sword World intelligence agencies or have moved from wanting to promote democratic reform to simply opposing the [[Imperium]].

The Ine Givar movement has become an umbrella for insurgencies on various worlds, anti-Imperial terrorism, organised crime and peaceful leaflet campaigns. Membership is proscribed by Imperial edict but not automatically assumed to mean that members are guilty of terrorism. However, the threat of prosecution is a useful tool in obtaining cooperation from captured members, who are a major source of intelligence for the Imperial authorities. The Ine Givar movement has responded to this threat by increasing compartmentalization of an already splintered organization. There are some who believe there is no longer a central leadership and that local groups are essentially independent despite claiming loyalty.
