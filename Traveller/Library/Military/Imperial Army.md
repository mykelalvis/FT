## IMPERIAL ARMY

The armies of the Imperium are much like planetary navies. Each world maintains its own army based on its population, available technology and individual needs. However, unlike planetary navies, armies are expected to contribute to the greater Imperial Army, sharing certain methodologies, technological standards, tactics and traditions.

Left to their own devices, the worlds of the Imperium do not always make the most logical decisions when it comes to building an army. Some worlds overbuild theirs and others underestimate the need for one, either fielding an army that ultimately proves to be insufficient or, in some cases, having no army at all. This environment produces a broad spectrum of military solutions. Some worlds with no army have an arrangement with one that does, thereby gaining a portion of its soldiers for their own defense. Others rely on mercenary forces. Some simply do without one, passively benefitting from ‘herd immunity’ by being among neighbors who have them.

The primary reason to have an army is to defend one’s world, although many worlds, especially those far from Imperial borders, do not see the need for one in the civilised Imperium. This can be a mistake since the Imperium does allow limited conquest to occur between worlds. Those who have an army are not given any form of largesse by the Imperium. Other than the obvious security it provides, the benefits of having an army are ephemeral. A world with an army can be proud that it provides for its own defense and that of its subsector by contributing to the Imperial Army. Worlds endowed with armies have greater prestige simply because they have demonstrated the ability to create one. Such worlds are seen as valuable citizens of the Imperium who contribute to its defense and become de facto members of a martial community.

Worlds of the Imperium are likely to have armies composed of the units described in the Unit Organization table. The larger the population of the world, the more likely the structure will resemble standard units. Smaller worlds (those with a Population code of 5 or less) may have less structure or they may have a militia instead. Militias may be organised in the same manner as traditional military units but not all of them are.

#### Unit Organization

|    Unit   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Unit Commander             |

### Branches of the Army

The _Traveller Core Rulebook_ includes three branch assignments for Travellers in the army: infantry, cavalry and support.

Infantry are the ground pounders, the poor souls who endure the brunt of war more than any other branch. Historically, infantry soldiers are required to take and occupy enemy territory, often suffering horrific casualties in the process. This does not change at higher Tech Levels. What does change is the mode of transportation. At low Tech Levels, infantry are expected to walk from place to place, sometimes alongside armored vehicles once TL4–7 is reached. At TL6–8, infantry are transported in trucks, armored personnel carriers (APCs) and other vehicles, but ultimately they find themselves in the same place; out in the open, hopefully in a foxhole with a rifle in hand, defending whatever territory their army has taken. At higher Tech Levels, gravitic transportation becomes available. At TL8–9, half of all vehicles are likely to be gravitic. By TL10+, gravitic APCs are standard and become better armed and armored as technology advances.

Personal armor improves with technology as well. At lower Tech Levels, infantry soldiers will be unarmored or at best lightly armored. By TL8, more effective armor, weaponry and communications devices become available. At TL10+, combat armor becomes available for commandos and other specialized troops and at TL12+ it becomes standard for most infantry.

Weaponry also varies with Tech Level. The standard TL12 infantry soldier is armed with a gauss rifle, a sidearm and an appropriate selection of grenades. At least one fire team in each squad or platoon is equipped with heavy weaponry, usually a tripod-mounted machine gun or VRF gauss weapon but alternatives are available.

Two subsets of infantry are lift infantry and jump troops. Lift infantry are soldiers in gravitic vehicles. Jump troops are dropped from orbit in specialized pods or with the aid of an ablative shield to plunge safely through atmosphere. Once on the ground, they are the vanguard of a larger assault force and often dropped in zones where they are to eliminate strategic targets or secure landing zones for the remainder of the army. Lift infantry are typically equipped with combat armor and light weaponry. Jump troops in the army are special forces as opposed to the marines, all of whom are trained for such operations. Notably, jump-trained army units post ‘drop wings’ on their uniforms while marines retain a space for wings but do not post them since all marines are jump troops.

For a selection of armor and weaponry used by the army, refer to the [[Central Supply Catalog]] and the [[Field Catalog]].

Cavalry on low-tech worlds are animal-mounted troops, riding horses, kians or other effective warsteeds. However, when in reference to the high-tech Imperial Army, cavalry refers specifically to soldiers who fight in fast, cross-country vehicles. At low- to mid-tech, cavalry operate small vehicles, trucks, halftracks, APCs and tanks. At higher Tech Levels, gravitic vehicles become standard. At the upper end of a cavalry unit are the tankers who operate armored fighting vehicles (AFVs), armed with a deadly array of weaponry designed to kill infantry and destroy other vehicles and tanks.

Support roles are many and varied in a high-tech army, including artillery, combat engineers, medics and staff. Artillery are trained in the use of the army’s field weapons. At low- to mid-Tech Levels, artillery is composed of large-calibre slug-throwing weapons that fire explosive munitions. As Tech Levels increase, artillery includes multiple rocket launchers (MRLs) and energy weapons that inflict massive amounts of damage  to enemy structures and personnel alike. Artillery is often referred to as simply ‘the killer’ for its astounding ability to suppress mobility and inflict casualties.

### BUILDING IMPERIAL ARMY UNITS

The concept of an empire-wide army did not take hold until the advent of the Third Imperium. The Sylean Federation had no unified army to speak of, instead allowing each of its worlds to raise its own army independently. While the Syleans did occupy worlds, notably during their war with the Interstellar Confederacy, individual armies were placed under the joint control of the president and Grand Senate of Sylea. Likewise, the Rule of Man applied a haphazard strategy, using armies from hundreds of worlds to pacify and occupy the worlds that it conquered from the Ziru Sirka. These methods were examined by the Third Imperium from a historical perspective and each was found lacking.

The Imperium intended to become a far greater and more expansive empire than its predecessors. If the Warrant for the Restoration of the Imperium was to be realised – which claimed possession of all worlds held by the previous human empires – then a more unified structure would be needed. Cleon Zhunastu believed that free trade and defense of the space between its worlds would be the glue that held the Imperium together. Despite his objection to the use of force to coerce worlds into accepting Imperial membership, he realised that an Imperial Army would be required. Not every world in Charted Space could be expected to accept the Imperium’s offer and there would come a day when it would be unacceptable, even dangerous, to have islands of independence in the midst of the empire. Furthermore, once the Imperium was established, revolts and insurrections would inevitably have to be put down from time-to-time.

In many ways, the Sylean model was merely improved upon. Individual worlds are still encouraged to raise their own armies but the joint-command structure at Capital, and subordinate commands in each sector and subsector, have a much more active role in the maintenance, standardization and training of planetary armies. Imperial Army units are configured at the subsector level. Individual worlds provide regiments that are organised into divisions during deployments and, if necessary, subsector divisions can be further organised into corps and whole armies if a larger deployment is necessary. Subsector-level Imperial Army units have been mobilised many times, usually to put down revolts or fight small wars. Sector-wide corps have only been organised into an army on one occasion: the Solomani Rim War.

The armies of individual worlds are organised within the Imperial Army as either attached or contributed formations. Attached formations are armies that do not regularly train with those of other worlds. As such, they may have distinctive tactics, cultures, uniforms, equipment and Tech Levels. When integrated into an Imperial Army division, attached formations are generally segregated from units that are built from contributed formations. Likewise, attached formations are given suitable assignments for units that do not regularly ‘play for the team’. Contributed formations regularly train with one another and have an array of standards that make it easy to mix and match troops from multiple worlds into a cohesive subsector or sector army.

Configuring subsector Imperial Army divisions has its challenges. While some worlds have armies that are large enough to handle an interstellar deployment on their own, this practice is frowned upon. Allowing the army of a single world to occupy another sends the wrong message, even when putting down a revolt. Furthermore, armies are effectively subcultures of worlds. As such, each has a unique persona and characteristics. Deploying the army of one world to another can result in a clash of cultures. For this reason, most Imperial Army deployments are composed of contributed formations from several worlds, transforming them into members of the homogenised Imperial Army.

> [!INFO]+ MESON REBELLION
> A recent example of an interstellar deployment was the Meson Rebellion in 1032 on Khikaba in Lishun. After Imperial Navy squadrons secured the system and Imperial Marine lift infantry secured a landing zone, an Imperial Army division, composed of regiments from Biaz Ven, Iksha and Surli, was deployed to the system mainworld to secure it. The garrison remains on Khikaba to this day and each of the regiments involved rotates troops into and out of the operational theatre. Counterinsurgency personnel were brought in to perform inspections of various sites and ensure that no items of TL9+ reach the planet. In the case of this deployment, the regiment from low-tech Surli were trained in the use of TL12 weapons, the standard for the deployment.

Clashing cultures are not the only factors to contend with when assembling a subsector army out of contributed formations. The Imperium has a broad range of population and Tech  evels. There are high-tech worlds with large populations, low-tech worlds with medium populations, mid-tech worlds with middling populations and every other combination in between. The Tech Level differences between armies can be significant. In the Core sector alone, there are massive disparities. For example, the high-population world of Shiirand has an army of 34 million soldiers, all of whom use TL7 equipment. Meanwhile, three parsecs away, the army of Ushra has 105 million soldiers armed to a much higher TL12 standard. The Imperium mitigates this imbalance with joint training exercises. Several battalions of Shiirand’s army are regularly deployed to Ushra to train with weapons and vehicles of higher technology. Likewise, soldiers in Ushra’s army might be rotated to TL14 Alekvadin to learn how to use man-portable fusion weapons in a separate cross-training program. It is not cost-effective for every soldier in a multi-million-sophont army to be shipped out to multiple worlds over the course of a military career. To help remedy this situation, soldiers who have been trained on weapons, vehicles and gear from higher-tech worlds are usually assigned the task of training their own soldiers in the use of the same equipment. Ultimately, a lower-tech army returns to its standard equipment but chances are that most of the soldiers in a subsector army have been exposed to high-tech gear at some point during their careers. Therefore, when called upon to serve in an interstellar deployment, the soldiers of any world’s army are generally proficient at the technological standard that is provided.

### ENCOUNTERS WITH THE IMPERIAL ARMY

The Imperial Army is almost everywhere in the Imperium. Use a world’s Universal World Profile as a guide with the following caveats. Note that this applies strictly to worlds within the boundaries of the Imperium.

Soldiers of the Imperial Army are a common sight on many Imperial worlds but are most visible on worlds with Population 5+, Government 6 or A and higher and a Law Level of A or higher. Worlds with Government 6 are governed by a colony, captive government or military rule. A colony world is likely to have a militia but a world with a captive government or military rule often has an occupying army present. In some cases, a high-ranking officer in the Imperial Army is the military governor of the world, although the role may be held by an officer of the Imperial Navy or an appointed civilian administrator who serves as a proxy for the military. A world under military rule is sometimes governed by a nearby star system, which may install a local representative to administer it.

> [!NOTE]- A LITTLE PIECE OF HOME
> **Patron**: Captain Qilaria Odom, Requisitions Officer, 467th Infantry.
> **Mission**: The garrison at Adkhi/Core has been present for decades, quelling an insurgency from Chanestin separatists. The 467 th is composed of three regiments out of the Saregon subsector. The regiments hail from Arvlaa Gam, Gaen Luum and Khuir. Due to high-priority police actions on Igla and Shakiiga, the garrison on Adkhi has had its tour extended and the troops are getting restless. Captain Odom wants to boost their morale by giving them a little taste of home. Military budgets are tight but Odom has been given a reasonable discretionary fund to acquire foods, entertainment products and other goods from each of the regiment’s homeworlds. The Travellers are hired to pick up 30 tons of freight and an additional 20 tons of goods (the portions from each world to be determined by the Referee) that will give these homesick soldiers something to be excited about. The 20 tons of speculative cargo is at the discretion of the Travellers but should reflect the unique cultures of each world.
> **Reward**: Standard freight fees and speculative cargo revenue plus future contracts with the army if the goods are well received by the troops.

Worlds with other government types may also have offworld Imperial Army units present. A captive government is not required. Sometimes it is deemed expedient to delegate defense to a more willing and capable partner. For example, Duuka in Core is an agricultural world with a population of 600,000. The world has no military of its own but has a small Imperial Army presence from nearby Mish, a high-population, industrialised world that relies upon Duuka for foodstuffs and other agricultural products.
