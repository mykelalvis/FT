## SEEDSPITTER

_(Pseudotupaia gigans)_

![[JTAS-01-104.jpg]]

The seedspitter is a small, moderately intelligent animal native to the forests and uplands of certain worlds throughout the Imperium. Externally, the seedspitter resembles the [[Terra|Terran]] shrew but is larger, massing about 3kgs (about the size of a small domestic cat). It has reddish-grey to reddish-brown fur, a domed head and an elongated nose.

At one time the seedspitter secreted an irritant poison, similar to a bee's venom, into a chamber located behind its upper lip. It would fill this chamber with venom, constrict it rapidly and squirt the irritant out through an opening in its upper lip, with sufficient force to propel it one or two meters. The irritant could paralyse small animals (a part of the seedspitter's diet).

As time passed, the animal learned to pick up fruit seeds or small stones with its tongue, insert them into its poison cavity and propel them at predators. The seedspitter developed this skill to the point where it only secreted enough poison to lightly coat the seed and lubricate its passage out of the chamber.

Because of its affectionate nature and appealing appearance, (the upturned corners of the mouth give the appearance of a perpetual smirk), the seedspitter is a common pet on starships, where it helps with pest control. Seedspitters are easily trained to do tricks such as hitting a target, or 'juggling' seeds by repeatedly spitting them into the air, catching them, and spitting them again. Well-trained animals can keep four or five seeds in the air at once.
