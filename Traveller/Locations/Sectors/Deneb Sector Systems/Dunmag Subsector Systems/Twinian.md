# TWINIAN

Twinian was never an important world, due to its very thin atmosphere of unbreathable gas. This was lost when the surface was bombarded with nuclear weapons and deadfall ordnance during the bad war of the 600s.
Some of the smaller sealed communities survived the initial attack but this just meant a slow death as life support equipment ran down. The world was abandoned for many decades before being repopulated to support a small starport.

Unlike Andalia, there was little difficulty in finding people willing to move to Twinian – with no atmosphere remaining there was little danger of contamination away from the craters – but a lack of investment created a dead-end community dependent on imports coming through the starport. Other towns were eventually built, largely as mining concerns, and are essentially self-governing. In addition, scavengers moved into the ruins of some settlements spared in the original attacks and corsairs have possibly used these areas as bases.

Twinian has a small scout base at the starport, which supports jump-2 communications across the middle of the subsector. A detachment of scientists works out of the base, studying the gradual outgassing from Twinian's rocky surface that will someday give it an atmosphere of sorts.
