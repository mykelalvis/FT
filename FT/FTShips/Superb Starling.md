The _[[Superb Starling]]_ is a customised Type-K safari ship. Like others of its class, the _Starling_ is an excursion vessel, designed to transport people of means to distant worlds in luxury and comfort so they can engage in hunting expeditions or wildlife tourism. The ship has two multi-environment holding tanks to contain live animals. The space normally reserved for a trophy lounge has been converted into a laboratory, in which one may examine specimens taken from captured or killed prey. There is a retractable observation porch that extends from the port-aft underside of the ship, enabling its owner and crew to relax and enjoy the view.

## Transport Environments

The _[[Superb Starling]]_ has two eight-ton multi-environment spaces – also called capture tanks – both of which can be configured to simulate the native climate of [[#Akussanja]] in order to keep the [[Shakuurzarpi]] alive and comfortable. The animals must be stored and fed in the tanks for multiple jumps, so are likely to spend several weeks in them before they can be transferred to the wildlife preserve on [[#Tinea-Fabre]].

Setting up the tanks requires a task chain, the first of which is a [[FTSkills#Life Sciences]] (Xeno or Animal Husbandry) check  vs +4 (1D hours). Success provides the data to program the tank. The follow-up task is an [[FTSkills#Engineer]] check (life support) (2Dx minutes) to configure the multi-environment space. The Travellers will not know if their configuration works until they execute the program.

After the program is initiated, the Travellers can check the health of the animals by making uncontested animal sciences rolls (2D minutes). A successful check indicates whether or not the configuration was successful. If this reveals that the Travellers failed to properly configure the tanks, allow them to retry their attempt.

Success on both tasks stabilizes the simulated environments in each tank so that the _[[Superb Starling]]_ may begin her voyage. Failure to properly program the tanks, followed by a failed veterinary check, results in a health hazard to the animals. Since they failed both checks, they do not notice the hazard until 1D hours after the animals have begun to suffer. Each affected animal takes a 2-shift hit. Saving affected animals and restoring their health requires an animal sciences check (1D hours) against +2 with the following results:


|   Shifts    |                                                                          Event                                                                          |

|     2+      |                                The animal is successfully treated and a number of hits are restored equal to the Effect.                                |
|      1      |                  The animal is successfully treated and may recover as normal with continued treatment over the course of the voyage.                   |
|   -2 to 0   | The animal takes 2 2-shift hits. The Animals (veterinary) check may be reattempted but a second failure of any type results in the death of the animal. |
| -3 or below |                                                          The animal goes into shock and dies.                                                           |
