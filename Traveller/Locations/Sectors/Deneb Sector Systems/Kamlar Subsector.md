Other than a small group of worlds in the spinward-coreward corner of Kamlar, both Kamlar and [[Vast Heavens Subsector|Vast Heavens]] are part of the [[Great Rift]], with very few star systems. Kamlar is nominally part of the [[Duke of Zeng]]'s area of interest, whilst Vast Heavens lies beyond the influence of the Denebian dukes.

Kamlar's worlds are part of the [[Imperium]], with the exception of [[Catacomb]] (which still aligns itself to the [[Imperium]]). Although they lie on the fringe of the [[Great Rift]] they look 'inward', towards other inhabited worlds, rather than out into the darkness. There are exceptions; a few long-range ships make the trip to [[Catacomb]] or conduct deep-space research. However, for the most part these worlds are little different from any others within the [[Imperium]], other than reduced traffic through their starports and less passing trade.

The [[Duke of Zeng]] maintains a mobile embassy in Kamlar most of the time, an old demilitarised cruiser outfitted to act as a flying palace and conference center.  Along with a handful of escorts, the embassy ranges among the worlds of Kamlar, sometimes returning to [[Zeng Subsector|Zeng]] to deal with matters requiring urgent attention.  Court is held at the embassy by members of the Duke's close family or representatives trusted to act for him and, very occasionally, by the [[Duke of Zeng]] himself.
