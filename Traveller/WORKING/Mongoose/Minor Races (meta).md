## MINOR RACES

There are many minor sentient races. Most are limited to a single world, and many have pre–industrial or even stone–age levels of technology. Others are starfarers. Many live alongside humans and others on dozens of worlds, having migrated to take a job or join a colonial mission.

Most minor races are naturally occurring species, though some are obviously variants or offshoots of other races. This might have been the work of the Ancients or could have other causes. Minor races sometimes cause a certain amount of head–scratching in the scientific community. For example, there may be two or more apparently identical species dwelling on homeworlds which are vastly distant from one another, with no evidence of a starfaring past.

Among the most commonly encountered minor races in Charted Space are the Bwaps (sometimes called Wabs or Newts). Their native–tongue name for themselves is Bawapakerwa–a–a– awapawab. Bwaps are small humanoids who originated in swampy terrain and need a humid environment to be comfortable. They are natural bureaucrats, and large numbers have entered the service of the Imperium as well as various worlds as administrators and accountants.

Chirpers (named for the calls they emit) are another minor race that can be encountered in various areas, though for different reasons. They are small and reclusive humanoids that exhibit some bird–like physical characteristics. Some observers suggest that they are little more than animals; others think that Chirpers are in fact very clever but not interested in the usual trappings of civilization. Chirpers are an oddity in that they seem to be native to many worlds all across Charted Space yet they have no technology or any sign of having ever possessed it.

There are many other minor races across Charted Space. Individuals and small groups from these species can be encountered going about their business almost anywhere.
