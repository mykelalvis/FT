# INTRODUCTION

Much of the time Travellers move from one starport to the next, seeing the shops and the bars and not much else. In between they stare at the same six bulkheads and watch old movies, or sit around in the galley chatting. Some of them have more to talk about than others; tales of adventure and daring that might just possibly be true. And every now and then the conversation turns to the wonders of Charted Space... the amazing places and strange sights that await those who dare to visit them. Some of these anomalies and wonders are mythical, some are known to be real, and some are not quite either of those. Anomalies and Wonders is a guide to some of those wondrous places. It will give Travellers something to talk about for years to come.

The locations and wonders presented in this book can be used in a variety of ways. They might generate rumours that the Travellers overhear, perhaps even prompting them to go looking for the places they have heard of, or they might be the backdrop to an adventure that could have been set somewhere more mundane, adding a level of wonder to the events unfolding around the Travellers. Some of these locations are supposed to have strange powers or to be connected with the Ancients, which might make finding their exact location a mission of its own. In short, these strange and awe- inspiring places are out there, awaiting adventurous spirits to experience their wonders and dangers.

# ANOMALIES AND WONDERS

_Traveller_ is, for the most part, a hard-science game, based on real-world science as far as possible. Predicting the future is not a simple business, especially when trying to imagine what technology might look like in four thousand years’ time, but we are not really trying to create an accurate prediction - we are creating a plausible imaginary universe where adventures are to be had. A certain amount of inaccuracy is perhaps forgivable so long as the end result is interesting and fun.

We are learning more about our universe all the time, and along the way we frequently discover that what we knew previously was in fact incorrect. Implementing modern knowledge of cosmology or biotechnology can be a tricky business for rules-writers, and a supplement that attempts to explain these things can turn into something more properly termed a textbook. Textbooks are rarely much fun to read, so again it is perhaps forgivable to generalise and simplify in the name of creating a fun game to play.

However, it is necessary to retain the feeling of ‘hard science’ and to maintain internal consistency. Thus the phenomena and wonders dealt with in this supplement are based in real-world science. Randomly tossing the Gizmo of the Day into a game, or plonking down incredible wonders all over the place makes them rather less wondrous, not to mention becoming a bit implausible. However, once in a while a group of Travellers might raise their eyes above the endless cycle of mortgage payments on their ship or out of the murk of the local criminal underworld.

They might see something truly amazing if they do.

## Using These Locations

What follows is a collection of situations, locations and phenomena that can be used to throw the Travellers a curveball or to regain a sense of wonder. Some of them are more wondrous than others, but all are unusual. Each of the locations or situations described can be slotted into a game universe wherever the referee finds it desirable. However, some require fairly specialist conditions. The phenomena described in this book cannot be randomly generated by any currently existing rules system, but they could exist at many points in the Traveller universe if the referee wants to place them. Which is a roundabout way of suggesting that it’s okay to put stuff into a star system if you want it there.

The phenomena in this book have been given names for identification, but could easily be renamed if this will make them fit better with the chosen location. As a general rule, so long as the UWP data for a system is not contradicted, anything goes. If the UWP says there are gas giants, then the referee is not breaking any rules by deciding how many and where they orbit. Additional inhabited worlds are possible, though as a rule if there is a more populous world than the current mainworld in the system, there needs to be a reason why it is not the mainworld. That in turn might lead to some adventure ideas...

And finally, let us not forget that tools like the random system generation rules in the Traveller Core Rulebook are just that – tools. They are useful but it is the craftsman who decides how to use them and when to set them aside. If the referee prefers to invent an entire star system without any die rolling at all, there is nothing wrong with that. So long as it is logical and consistent (this is a science-fiction game, after all), and an interesting and a fun place to have adventures, then it does not really matter how the setting was created.

# STELLAR AND INTERSTELLAR PHENOMENA

Stellar phenomena are, as the name suggests, mostly stellar objects such as stars, brown dwarf quasi- stellar objects and the like. This section also includes interstellar objects and phenomena that are not associated with a planetary system, such as comets and deep-space objects. These may not appear on the standard starmaps as the latter are geared towards interstellar travel and trade, which typically moves between mainworlds of star systems. Interstellar phenomena generally only appear on specialist charts, if they are known at all.

# PLANETARY PHENOMENA

Planetary phenomena are defined, for our purposes, as large-scale objects within a solar system or on a plane, such as moons and asteroids, as well as actual planets that are unusual in some way. Traveller mapping system is based on the mainworld characteristics, and often does little more than mention that there are gas giants present (or not) in a system. Additional planets and gas giants may be of interest to some starfarers, but are routinely ignored by commercial traffic that plies the routes from one major port to another. Thus many star systems contain areas that have not been more than cursorily mapped, and some bodies in a system might never have been visited even though the mainworld was colonised a thousand years ago.

# LOCAL PHENOMENA

Local phenomena are those associated with a world or a region of it. This may or may not be the mainworld of a system. Local phenomena include natural features, usual terrain or weather conditions, and even some kinds of fauna. Some of these phenomena are listed in the starcharts as a point of interest about a world. Others may come as a surprise to Travellers. They might be the destination of or the backdrop to an adventure, or perhaps an interesting backdrop to other events. Whatever else, these places will provide stories for the ship’s galley or the starport bar for years to come.
