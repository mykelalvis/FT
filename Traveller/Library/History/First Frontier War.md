# The First Frontier War

The First Frontier War (589 to 604) was the first of a series of wars between the lmperium and the Zhodani Consulate. The Zhodani had rallied to their side the Vargr of the neighboring Gvurrdoun Sector and formed the Outworld
Coalition. The initial attacks caught the lmperium less than fully prepared and quickly expelled Imperial settlements from Zhodani territories beyond the Spinward Marches Sector boundaries. Fighting continued for fifteen years and was characterized by raids against high population worlds deep within the sector. Ultimately, armistice lines were drawn. ceding portions of the Cronor subsector to the Zhodani. Grand Admiral Olav hault-Plankwell had defeated an expeditionary Zhodani/Vargr fleet at Zivije following its raid against Jae Tellona (both in the Rhylanor Subsector). The result crippled the Zhodani capability to prosecute the war fully but also inflicted enough losses on the Imperial squadrons to force a stalemate. The negotiated armistice allowed the lmperium to claim a large amount of previously unincorporated territory to replace the parts of Cronor subsector ceded to Zhodani. Admiral hault-Plankwell claimed victory for the lmperium, while simultaneously castigating the central Imperial authority for its lack of support during the war. Admiral haultâ€”P|anl<we|l's subsequent expedition to the capital and assassination of the Empress Jacqueline began the Civil War i604 to 622i.
