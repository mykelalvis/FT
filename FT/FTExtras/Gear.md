# GEAR 

> [!note]- Cribbed entirely from Bulldogs! gear
> This all came from Bulldogs, which seems like a fun game but isn't Traveller.

While a player character is likely to rely more on natural ability and learned skills than equipment, gear is still important. Gear gets you from place to place. Gear allows you to shoot the other guy before they shoot you (with their gear). Gear keeps you alive in the cold vacuum of space. Depending on the equipment in question, a particular piece of gear may be every bit as important as your natural abilities, especially when you’re tooling around.

## BUYING THINGS
You’ll end up buying most of your gear, and to do that, you need to know how much money you have. Wealth is an abstract concept. Specific numbers of  credits aren’t important and— thanks to things like a pure credit-based economy, huge amounts of property ownership, and other such complications—keeping track of specific credits would likely be a game in and of itself and not a very fun one. 

As such, wealth is measured using the credits track. 

## The Credits Track

Money is an abstraction.  It matters, but certain values of it matter more or less, depending on situations.  The credit track indicates how flush a character is using stress and consequences.

It should be noted that while money _totally matters_ and it is, in fact, _frequently the motivator for everything_, specific scheming to make particular amounts might not turn out narratively as one would expect.  It's not that the character is somehow `ABOVE MERE MONEY MATTERS` (unless they are, of course), but rather than the money is abstracted enough that the difference between 1000 credits or dollars or yen or whatever and 10,000 might not be such a big deal.  The impact on credit/wealth stress and consequences is more important.

### Credit Stress

Every character starts (at the beginning of creation) with a credits track of 10 boxes, all but one of which is filled. That means that you’ve got almost nothing in the way of credits. Maybe you’ve got enough that you’re set for a couple drinks down at the local watering hole, but maybe you don’t have the scratch to buy a ticket to a better place. You can dream, though. 

You’ll clear boxes from your credits track whenever you make substantial amounts of money, whether from payments from work or from more... illicit means.

### Credit Consequences
Each character starts with a mild (1-pt) and moderate (2-pt) consequence.  These are available if you end up financially compromised, and must generally be worked off before you can gain credit stress beyond where the consequences were taken.

Certain aspects (`Scion of a Shipping Magnate`) or backgrounds might have an additional consequence or two.  This will be done on per-case basis.  


## Making Money
Most of the  money you make will probably come from jobs. The base pay is 1 box on your credits track per month. You may get paid out additional money based on hazardous conditions: 
- +1 credits box for missions [[Charted Space]]
- +1 credits box for extremely dangerous missions 
- +1 credits box for urgent deliveries or rescues 

When trying to figure out how much money any other windfall is worth, base it on the following rubric: 
- 1 box if it’s decent but not noteworthy pay: a ship part, a quality weapon, a crate of goods.
- 2 boxes if it’s a sizeable windfall: a good piece of artwork, a space fighter, a box of rare cigars 
- 3 boxes if it’s a giant horde: a rich man’s bank account, some ancient valuable artifact, a good quality space freighter. 

You can also translate credits boxes into gear points. One credit box is worth one gear point, generally speaking. See below for more about using credit boxes to purchase gear 
## Making a Purchase
Paying someone money simply requires checking off some number of credit boxes. This is most useful for when you’re making a bribe, and it’s a good way of paying a major cost in negotiations. Paying for an item works the same—you find a supplier, mark off the right number of credit boxes for the item’s cost, and it’s yours! 
An item’s cost is dependent upon the general rules above. If it’s a piece of useful gear, then its cost is the number of gear points invested in the item. A heavy flamethrower, for example, is three gear points, so it costs three credits if you pick it up at the local swap meet. Something simple like a universal translator probably only costs one gear point, and gear less fancy than that might not cost any gear points at all. 
If you can convince your crewmates to lend you the necessary credit boxes, then they can check off their own to assist you with a purchase. Good luck getting them (tricking them!) to foot the bill! 
> Prbrawl wants to buy a new gun: a neuro-disruptor worth two gear points. He starts by using [[Contacts]] to discover a dealer willing to sell such a device, but he fails his roll. Prbrawl decides to take a major cost instead of failure; his GM tells him that he’s got a line on a black market gun dealer willing to sell him his new neuro-disruptor, but the dealer’s more than a little bit of an extortionist. He’s willing to sell, but only for twice what the gun’s actually worth, and Prbrawl’s not going to find another dealer with a neuro-dis rupter, he promises that. Prbrawl has to check off four boxes of his credit track to buy the item: the base price is two boxes, and the dealer doubled the price. But so long as Prbrawl’s willing to mark off the boxes, the dealer is more than willing to take the money and hand over the gun. 
## Negotiations
When you want to dicker over the price of something you’re purchasing, use the [[Negotiate]] skill to negotiate. Engaging in negotiations over price is a special kind of contest, like a foot race where both sides kick the tires and try to talk each other down (or up) before agreeing on a final price.

Start by determining which characters are involved on both sides of the table. One character on each side takes the lead for the negotiation, acting as the person with the final word; the rest of the characters can help out with the negotiation, but someone’s got to be in charge on both sides. 
Each character involved then gets one chance to create an advantage—`NOT SUCH A FANCY CAR` or `WHY WOULD I SELL TO A LOSER CREW?`—before both lead negotiators roll a contested overcome action ([[Negotiate]] vs. [[Negotiate]]). Other characters in the scene may use teamwork to add +1s to the lead negotiator’s roll in addition to providing their advantages. 
Whoever wins the roll can increase or reduce the typical price of the item or job in question by one credits box on a success and two credits boxes on a success with style. This may reduce the cost of an item to zero; the item was so cheap it doesn’t affect your resources in any meaningful way. On a tie, a narrative twist occurs, such as another buyer interrupting the negotiations or the police breaking up the meeting. 
Characters may mark credit boxes to pay for an item based on its final price, one for one. They may also take consequences (on their normal consequence slots) to gain that number of shifts in credits boxes for a purchase, i.e. `IN DEBT TO THE SALDRALLAN` or `HOCKED MY FAVORITE GUN`. These consequences fill your Wealth consequence slots, and you can recover them just like normal consequences, via appropriate overcome actions. 
> Prbrawl decides to try to negotiate the price with the dealer. Quinn is there, too, to help make sure Prbrawl doesn’t get into too much trouble, so she’s on his side in the negotiation. Quinn first tries to create an advantage with Provoke, intimidating the dealer into lowering the price and succeeds. She makes the aspect `LOWER PRICES ARE GOOD FOR YOUR HEALTH`. 
> Then, Prbrawl makes his own advantage, trying to play good cop to Quinn’s bad (a reversal for them), and rolls Rapport. He fails; the weapons dealer isn’t buying his smiles and friendly act, and Prbrawl’s failed create advantage roll gets the dealer a `NOT MY FIRST SALE` aspect. The weapons dealer gets to create his own advantage, using [[Shoot]] to play up his knowledge of the gun and its excellent quality. He succeeds and creates the aspect `HIGH QUALITY NEURO DISRUPTION`. Prbrawl and the dealer both roll [[Negotiate]], invoke their created advantages, and... Prbrawl beats the dealer with a regular success! He can convince the dealer to lower the price of the gun by one credits box, bringing it down to 3 credit boxes. 
## Trading Gear
Sometimes, instead of just buying a piece of gear, you can trade an existing piece for a new one. You can always trade a piece of gear for one worth fewer gear points, as long as you can find someone with the gear you’re looking to get in exchange. To trade for a piece of gear with the same number of gear points, you enter a negotiation, just like when you’re buying gear. On a failure, you can still make the trade, but at a loss, either by marking a single credit box, or by taking a piece of gear with fewer upgrades. On a tie or success, you make the trade successfully. On a success with style, you get a boost related to how well the trade went. If you want to trade a piece of gear for something worth more than it is, treat it as a negotiation for a purchase, with the traded piece of gear helping to offset the cost of the gear you’d like to receive. 
##STARTING GEAR 
Every character begins with some starting gear. Gear is measured in gear points, which represent how useful, costly, and powerful the gear is. You get two gear points by default to spend on your starting gear, and you can convert your remaining refresh into more gear points, at the rate of 1 refresh per 2 gear points. You can spend your starting gear points on weapons, shields, armor, or personal equipment. 
## WEAPONRY
Weaponry in the galaxy comes in a wide variety of forms and is disturbingly common place. While it’s true that ordinary citizens on highly developed, highly policed worlds are unlikely to carry weapons, roughly 85% of the population outside of these civilized planets does carry some form of sidearm. In most cases, this is for simple self-defense, but there are quite a few mercenaries and bounty hunters out there, and any freighter worth its salt has at least one or two armed guards among its crew. 
Most weapons aren’t important enough to give any kind of special consideration. If a character has the [[Shoot]] skill, they probably have a gun of some kind, but it’s nothing special. Just enough to allow them to use [[Shoot]]. If someone is a knife fighter, then they have knives. But again, nothing special. 
### Size Matters
Important weapons, however, are built by spending gear points (or Stunts). They are divided into three tiers: light (tier one), medium (tier two), and heavy (tier three). 
#### LIGHT
A light weapon gets an aspect with a free invoke once per session. 
#### MEDIUM
A medium weapon gets an aspect with a free invoke once per session. It also bypasses the minor conditions, Winded and Angry, meaning that a target cannot mark Winded or Angry boxes to absorb stress from a hit by a medium weapon. 
#### HEAVY
A heavy weapon gets an aspect with a free invoke once per session. It also bypasses the Winded, Angry, and Stunned conditions, meaning that a target cannot mark Winded, Angry, or Stunned boxes to absorb stress from a hit by a heavy weapon. 
### Names
Use the aspect on the weapon to name it, to define what makes it cool or interesting; any weapon with gear points invested in it is pretty important! 
>Prbrawl is shooting an enemy bounty hunter, The Space Wraith, with his new `PROTONIC NEURO-DISRUPTOR`. It’s a [[#medium]] weapon. 
>Prbrawl gets a successful attack on The Space Wraith, and inflicts a solid 4 stress. Because the neuro-disruptor is a medium weapon, The Space Wraith can’t mark any of that 4 stress on her Winded or Angry conditions; she has to either absorb it through consequences or mark it on her Stunned and Broken conditions. In this case, she takes a moderate consequence to absorb the stress, and continues fighting with Prbrawl. 

### Colossal Weapon
If ever a weapon would be treated as beyond heavy—meaning it would be a tier four weapon, a colossal weapon—it receives an additional free invoke once per session and bypasses all conditions. Stress from a colossal weapon is absorbed only through consequences. 
Any weapon of spaceship scale is automatically considered colossal when used against personnel or other soft targets. Characters may not wield colossal weapons in conflicts; they always have to be anchored or supported somehow by ships or other fixed positions. 

### Adjustments
Weapons can be further improved with small adjustments, each one purchased at the cost of a single gear point: 
#### ACCURATE
Whether because of gyroscopic stabilizers or enhanced targeting scopes, you tend to hit with this weapon more often than not. Take +1 when creating advantages needing precision targeting with this weapon using Shoot from up to two zones away from your target. 
#### ADDITIONAL CAPABILITY
This gun can be used to fire special ammunition. Choose what kind of ammunition it is when you take this improvement: GLUE AMMO, EMP AMMO, STUNNING AMMO, etc. 
Once per session, you can load this ammo to put a related situation aspect upon a target when you successfully hit them, in addition to the stress you deal. 
#### ASPECT
You can add another aspect to the weapon. The aspect does not come with a free invoke. 
#### AUTOFIRE
With a weapon capable of autofire, you can attack multiple enemies in the same zone. Once per conflict, you can attack two targets in the same zone during a single exchange. Make a separate attack roll against each target. 
#### CONCEALABLE
Sometimes it’s important to be able to hide a gun on your person. Maybe your gun is just smaller than normal, or is collapsible, or can be reconfigured to look like something non-threatening. You gain a +1 bonus to any overcome rolls made with Stealth to hide this weapon. 
#### EXPLOSIVE
This weapon blows up. When you detonate this device, everyone in the zone must defend against a Good (+3) attack. You can spend additional gear points to raise that attack by +2 per gear point or to increase the tier of the weapon as normal. You can only use this device once per session. (It’s assumed you can find or build another bomb between sessions)
#### LONG RANGE
Some guns have sniper scopes, while others have advanced targeting systems. When you fire this gun, you can attack things that are further away; you can hit targets up to four zones away. 
####BOOST EFFECT
Whether it’s a flamethrower that spews napalm or a laser gun that stuns your enemies, a weapon with this improvement allows you to apply a pre-specified boost—like `ON FIRE!` or `DAZED`—when you successfully attack a target. Once per session, when you attack a target and succeed with style, you can get two boosts instead of just one: the boost from this ability, and your normal boost for a success with style. 
#### POWERFUL
The weapon is more damaging than others of its kind. Once per conflict, on a successful hit, it deals 1 additional shift of stress.
#### SCATTERSHOT
This gun fires a spread of projectiles, a wide cone of laser light, a scattering blast shot, or something similar. If your target is close to you— usually within the same zone—you apply an additional stress on a successful hit.
#### SPECIALIZED
some weapons are really good against armor while others are extremely effective against synthetic targets like robots. Some guns are designed to disrupt shields or fire extremely well in low-gravity. When you choose this improvement, choose a very specific condition in which the weapon is special ized: against robots, against armor and shields together, in zero g, etc. Once per conflict, you can take a +1 bonus to an attack with Shoot with the weapon in that condition.

## ARMOR
Armor is fairly common throughout the galaxy, primarily because most modern armor can be incorporated into environmental suits, allowing the wearer to protect against enemy gunfire and hostile environments with a single piece of gear. Armor is typically very strong against physical attacks, such as swords, fists, and bullets, but tends to be a bit weaker against things like fire, plasma, and lasers, although either way it will keep you alive when it counts. 
### Armor Size Matters
Armor, like weapons, is divided into three tiers: light (tier one), medium (tier two), and heavy (tier three). Armor provides additional consequence slots that players can use to soak stress during conflicts. These consequences recover normally, with overcome actions using appropriate skills to repair the armor. 
#### LIGHT Armor
Light armor gets an aspect with a free invoke per session. Light armor also has a single mild consequence slot. 
#### MEDIUM
Medium armor gets an aspect with a free invoke per session. Medium armor also has a mild consequence slot and a moderate consequence slot. 
HEAVY: Heavy armor gets an aspect with a free invoke per session. Heavy armor also has 1 each of mild, moderate, and severe consequence slots. Just like with weapons, use the aspect on your armor to call out what makes it unique and interesting. The GM, of course, can use that aspect to compel your character; a `TEMPLAR HARDSUIT` may cause you to move more slowly in a tense situation or hold up poorly to laser fire. 
>Quinn bought a new bit of armor, a `MONOFILAMENT DIAMONDSPIDER VEST`. Good thing, too. She’s getting stabbed by an angry Hacragorkan knife fighter. She invokes the aspect for her one free invoke per session to have the vest deflect an incoming blow, but she still takes a solid 3-stress hit. She takes a mild consequence on the vest—`THIN SLIT`—and marks the remaining stress on her conditions. 

### Armor Improvements
You can add improvements to your armor using additional great points. Improvements increase the cost by 1 gear point per improvement. 
#### Armor ASPECT
You can add aspects to armor. These aspects can be invoked just like any aspect. 
#### CAMOUFLAGE
Armor can be made to blend in with various environments—most modern armor utilizes a reprogrammable surface pigment system that allows for multiple camou flage patterns and colors. Camouflage armor gives you a +1 bonus to overcome rolls with Stealth to hide.
#### ENVIRO-SUIT
Armor with this improvement allows you to survive in hostile environments. It’s equipped to mitigate the effects of extreme heat and cold, caustic or poisonous atmo spheres, or even the vacuum of space. An enviro-suit gives you a +1 bonus to defend with Survival against environmental attacks related to the environments your armor is suited to. 
#### HARDENED
The armor is harder to penetrate than normal. Once per session, you can reduce the shifts of a successful hit against you by one. 
#### POWERED ARMOR
Powered armor is relatively rare, mostly because it’s big, bulky, and obvious. It does, however, have advantages. The armor enhances the strength of its wearer, allowing them to perform feats of might that would otherwise be impossible. Once per session, you can use the strength of your powered armor to take +1 on an overcome roll with Physique relying on brute strength.  
In [[Fated Travels]], requires the [[FTSkills#Battle Dress]] stunt.
#### RAY-COATING
This special, reflective coating was designed in response to the prevalence of laser weapons amongst assassins and snipers. It’s designed to reflect as much of a laser’s energy as possible, protecting the wearer from such weapons. Once per session when you’re hit successfully with a laser weapon, you can reduce the shifts of stress on the hit by 2. 
## SHIELDS
Shields are less common than armor, but they’re also less cumbersome; it’s also far easier to hide a shield’s presence. Many politicians expecting an assassination attempt wear a shield, while their bodyguards often wear armor. Shields offer decent protection against physical attacks, but they’re renowned for their utility against energy-based weapons. Shields are divided into three tiers, just like weapons and armor: light (tier one), medium (tier two), and heavy (tier three). They provide their wearers with additional stress boxes to soak hits. The bigger the shield, the more stress boxes it provides. When the stress track is full, the shield can no longer be marked to avoid stress. At the end of a conflict, the shield’s stress track will automatically clear. 
- LIGHT: Light shields have a 2-box stress track. 
- MEDIUM: Medium shields have a 3-box stress track. 
- HEAVY: Heavy shields have a 4-box stress track. 

All shields are pretty much the same, so they don’t have aspects to distinguish them. You can mark stress on shields any time you’re hit with a physical attack. 
> Prbrawl is wearing his light shield into combat, and he comes under fire from a rogue warbot hiding among the jungle vines. The warbot inflicts a 3-stress hit on him. He takes two stress on his shield, blowing it out for the rest of the conflict, and marks one stress on his own conditions. 
### Shield Improvements
As with armor, you can add improvements to your shield. Improvements increase the cost by 1 gear point per improvement. 
#### ASPECT
You can add aspects to a shield. These aspects can be invoked just like any aspect. 
#### EXTRA BATTERY
You have an extra battery for your shields. Once per session, you can clear 2 shield stress boxes by swapping your battery. In a conflict, this requires a full action. 
#### OVERLOAD
You have a switch on your shield that allows you to overload it and create a brilliant explosion. Once per session, you can mark every shield stress box to create a situation aspect, `DAZED` on anyone with their eyes open. This situation aspect comes with one free invocation. 
#### REINFORCED QUANTUM FIELD
The shield is harder to penetrate than normal. Once per session, you can reduce the shifts of a successful hit against you by 1. 
#### STEALTH FIELD
Some shields are designed to be able to bend light around them, rendering the wearer effectively invisible to normal vision. However, enabling a stealth field is taxing on a shield, draining its power quickly. You can deplete your shield’s charge in order to become effectively invisible. Mark two stress boxes on your shield to take a +2 bonus to overcome obstacles with Stealth for a single action. 
#### SPECIALIZED
Shields are generally all designed similarly, but if you know what you’re doing, you can tailor the specs for your purposes and make them particularly suited to specific conditions. When you choose this improvement, choose a very specific condition in which your shields are specialized - against high-speed projectiles, against temperature extremes, against EMP, in a vacuum, etc. Once per session, you can take a +1 bonus to defend with [[Athletics]] while your shield is on and the condition applies.

## PERSONAL GEAR
Shooting things and protecting yourself from being shot is all well and good, but it’s only part of what you’ll be doing in Bulldogs!. You need a variety of other gear to get various jobs done. From comm units to jet packs, having the right piece of gear for the situation can spell the difference between success and failure. 
Just like with weapons, you can have all kinds of basic level gear, as long as it makes sense in the fiction for you to have them. For example, if you’re on the ship, you probably have some kind of personal comm unit without issue.  Personal items made with gear points are about the special, exceptional pieces of gear that help you out more than usual. 
When you’re designing a personal item, you start with a base item. Any item that you purchase without adding improvements or aspects is assumed to allow you to use relevant skills, and its cost is negligible—you won’t have to mark off any boxes from your credits track for it. For your gear to have a mechanical effect, you have to customize it with gear points. 
### Personal Gear Improvements
Once you’ve decided on a basic piece of equipment, start adding improvements to get the functionality you want. As with other types of gear, adding an improvement increases its cost in gear points by 1.
ALTERNATE USAGE
This item allows you to use one skill in place of another skill for a particular action in a particular circumstance, just like a stunt. A device might have sophisticated targeting systems, allowing you to use [[Engineering]] in place of [[Shoot]] when you have enough time to activate the targeting program. Another device might amplify your telekinetic abilities, allowing you to use [[Will]] in place of [[Physique]] when you’re targeting something from a distance. Cost: 2 gear points.
ARMED
This item has a weapon attached to it, whether it’s a barricade with a mounted gun or an armband that houses a concealed blade. Create and purchase the attached weapon separately, using the normal rules for whatever weapon you’re creating. 
ARMORED
This item has built-in armor. Create and purchase the armor separately, using the normal rules for armor. This armor applies to the item and will defend against any attacks directed against the object itself. 
ASPECT
You can add aspects to an item. These aspects can be invoked just like any other aspect. 
CONSCIOUS
This item incorporates true (or limited) artificial intelligence; it’s capable of thinking and reasoning, as well as performing complex tasks independently of you, within a limited scope. Cost: 2 gear points. Choose one of the following benefits:
- Three skills at Average (+1)
- Two skills at Fair (+2)
- One skill at Good (+3)
 Your gear with this improvement can either take actions on your behalf, using its skill instead of yours, or it can assist you by providing a teamwork bonus where appropriate. 
CRAFTSMANSHIP
This item is particularly well-made; once per session, you can take a +1 bonus on a specific skill when you use the item. You must choose the skill when you take this improvement. 
MINIATURIZATION
This item is much smaller than a normal item of its type. A miniatur ized item is more portable and easier to conceal than a normal item of its type. Gain a +1 to Stealth rolls to conceal the item. 
SHIELDED
This item has a built-in energy shield. Create and purchase the shield sepa rately, using the normal rules for shields. These shields apply to the item and will defend against any attacks directed against the object itself. 
SPECIAL EFFECT
This is a sort of catch-all improvement for doing badass things with your gear. If you’re looking for an item that teleports you, or allows you to speak with the dead, or some other off-the-wall thing, this is the improvement for you. The benefit of this improvement is highly variable, depending on what you make your item do. Consequently, the cost of this improvement is also highly variable; work with your GM to come up with a reasonable price. Most things will have a cost of 1 gear point, but depending on the effect, the cost could go as high as 3 or 4. 
### MAKING GEAR
You can create your own items from component materials if you’re sufficiently inclined— and doing so can save you money! You’re going to need a workshop to do it, and the skills to put the item together, along with the necessary parts, but still—it might be better than dealing with some sleazy dealer. 
## Workshops
Workshops are essentially collections of tools and supplies that you keep on hand in order to be able to create and work on gear. You can’t make gear without a good enough workshop. Your skills will only take you so far; you need the tools to use those skills, too. 
A workshop has two attributes, _type_ and _quality_
### Workshop Type
A workshop’s _type_ determines what kinds of items you can use it for. A workshop can have multiple types, but each additional type increases its cost by 1 credits box. If a workshop doesn’t have the right type, then you can’t use it to make or work on items of that nature. You can choose from the following types: 
#### ARMS
for creating guns and armor. 
#### CHEMISTRY
for creating explosives, as well as any chemical-based items.
#### ELECTRONICS
for creating shields, as well as any personal electronic devices.
#### HANDCRAFT
for creating archaic weapons, as well as other non-electronic items. 
#### VEHICULAR
for creating vehicles of all kinds. 
### Workshop Quality
A workshop’s quality determines how useful the workshop is in creating things. The workshop’s quality has to equal or exceed the cost of whatever item you’re creating; otherwise, the tools aren’t good enough. The credits box cost of the workshop is equal to its quality.
### Putting Gear Together
If you want to create an item from base materials and you have a workshop of at least the same quality as the cost of the item you want to make, then make an [[Engineering]] roll to overcome a difficulty equal to the normal gear point cost of the item in question. 
When you build something, it isn’t free, though; you have to pay for the raw materials and tools required to build the device. The cost of the raw materials is equal to the item’s cost –1 in credits boxes. (If you’re building an item that would normally cost one gear point, you probably have enough materials on hand in your workshop. Lucky you!) In addition, it takes time to build your own gear. A simple item takes a few days to make, but more complex items can take longer. The GM determines the amount of time required, but a success with style typically means that you build the item faster. Typically, you can only make one new piece of gear per session. If you fail your [[Engineering]] roll to create the item, it might take much longer to make than you thought or it might cost more credits boxes to pay for more materials—most likely you had to make multiple attempts to build the item, using up crucial materials that had to be replaced.
> Prbrawl decides to craft some binoculars that allow him to use Survival instead of Engineering to discover information about technology and structures at a distance. (That’s an Alternate Usage item, which costs 2 gear points.) Prbrawl first needs to obtain raw materials valued at 1 credits box. 
> The next time he has shore leave, he drops by the local market and picks up raw parts from a Dolom tech dealer, marking off one box on his credits track. Luckily for Prbrawl, his ship has a workstation for hi-tech gear. 
> The difficulty for the Engineering roll is Fair (+2), equal to the normal cost of the final item, and the GM says the binoculars will take a few days to build. Prbrawl rolls his Engineering and fails, badly. The GM says that it’s going to take even longer to build; Prbrawl probably won’t have his binoculars until next session, which is after he was hoping to have them to help with this spy mission. 

### Improving Gear
Improving an item works a lot like creating one from scratch, except that you’re starting with the base item and, effectively, “creating” the improvements. To determine the cost of the improvements you’re adding to your item, start with the base item’s gear point cost and add any improvements to that base item. Once the final cost with the new improvements is determined, you need to spend credits boxes equal to the difference between the final cost and the base cost to buy the improvements, or you can create them yourself using the rules above for creating pieces of gear from scratch.
