# THE K'KREE

The K'kree are a race of herbivorous herd-creatures
whose home lies to trailing of the Imperium. They are
quite possibly the greatest threat to the survival of
Humaniti as a species.

The K'kree are sometimes colloquially referred to
as Centaurs, after ancient [[Terra|Terran]] myth. They have a
quadruped main body and hindquarters, with an upright
frontal torso; well suited to roaming the plains of their
homeworld, their large bodies impede the ability to
carry out highly technical tasks. In particular, the K'kree
are not natural spacefarers as, in addition to their
considerable size and bulk, they are psychologically
dependent on the support of the herd. A K'kree isolated
from its friends will soon go mad with loneliness.

The K'kree are militant herbivores. Millenia of battling
for survival against the predators of their homeworld
has left them with a pathological hatred for what they
call G'naak – meat-eaters or, more properly translated,
vermin. This is how the K'kree view most other species:
inferior, threatening and worthy only of extermination.
K'kree folk tales contain many references to trampling
G'naak under the massed hooves of the herd and they
have taken this manifest destiny with them to the stars.

This makes K'kree rather difficult to get along with,
both on a personal and political scale. They are realistic
enough to realise they cannot exterminate all G'naak
in the universe, not all at once, but that does not stop
them wanting to. K'kree can and do build friendships
with non-K'kree but this is very rare and usually on the
K'kree's terms. G'naak who have been subjugated and
follow a herbivorous diet are tolerable; everyone else is
somewhere on the to-kill list.

This section contains details of K'kree society and
culture, including their critically important family and
herd structures and presents rules for playing a K'kree
Traveller. In almost all cases a K'kree Traveller will not
be alone; they will be part of a small group which, in
many ways, acts as an individual. There is no 'hive
mind' for K'kree but they have such strong family
identity and clearly defined roles that often a family
can be thought of in much the same way as a human
individual... only taking up a lot more space.

Also detailed are K'kree technology, weaponry
and starships. Their unusual physical and social
characteristics require a very different approach to
vehicles and vessels. Nevertheless, they are considered
to be one of the Major Races as they developed the
jump drive independently of all other species.

The K'kree are very different to other aliens and should
be approached with caution (both in-game and around
the gaming table) as they are utterly inflexible in some
ways and some characteristics can make them hard
to play. As herd creatures, K'kree absolutely must
be close to others of their own kind or they become
distressed and, eventually, insane. A 'lone wolf' K'kree
Traveller could conceivably exist with a suitable
backstory but they would have ceased to be K'kree
in the eyes of their fellows and probably could not
function for long between breakdowns.

This is reflected in K'kree Traveller creation, where a
K'kree gains a family as well as skills and it is the group
rather than the individual that is played. This is open
to exploitation, perhaps using the extra family members
as cannon fodder or to carry out dangerous tasks but
such acts would be out of character for K'kree, who are
instinctively compelled to safeguard and protect their
family and herd. Playing the patriarch of a group of
K'kree rather than a conventional Traveller is a challenge
that should only be attempted by experienced players
who understand what they are getting into.

K'kree are also strict traditionalists who have a
pathological hatred of meat-eaters of all kinds. There
is no flexibility here; meat-eaters are the enemy,
always, and the strict hierarchy of K'kree society must
be obeyed. Travellers are typically characterised by a
desire to 'do their own thing', often in disregard for
social norms and rules. Such individualism is something
K'kree _just don't do_. There is no such thing as a 'bit of a
rebel' in K'kree society; an individual who behaved that
way would be outcast or perhaps just killed as a threat
to the herd – changes to traditional values and way of
life are as big a threat to the K'kree as casualties among
the population – and once outcast would be subject to
the ill-effects of isolation.

K'kree can be played as Travellers but doing so is a
unique experience that requires exploring the mindset
of a totally alien race. That is a rewarding experience
because it is difficult and the Referee should ensure
anyone wanting to play a K'kree family as a Traveller
knows what will be required. It is not a good idea to
allow play of more than one family member unless
the subordinates know they are required to obey in all
things and are willing to do so. If the Travellers want to give it a try anyway, good for them! The Referee should
have no mercy on those who stray from the tenets of
K'kree existence. The K'kree themselves have none, as
we shall see...

## PHYSIOLOGY

The K'kree are described by scientists as herbivorous,
homeothermic (warm-blooded), bilaterally symmetrical
hexapods, breathing an oxygen-nitrogen mix. A typical
adult is around 2-2.4m tall and masses about 550kg –
about eight times the average human. K'kree bodies are
covered in thick fur, which is usually grey or black.

The two forelimbs end in manipulatory organs similar,
but different in construction, to the human hand. K'kree
'fingers' are actually tubes of cartilage, with only the
opposable thumb containing bone. This allows the
fingers to be pulled out of the way for the hand to be
used as a surprisingly effective blunt instrument. The
K'kree hand is highly dextrous but generally weaker in
grip strength than a human hand.

The four rear limbs are proportioned for walking and
end in feet often colloquially referred to as hooves. In
fact the rear feet combine the function of a hoof with a
less dextrous version of their hands. The 'toes' (which
are again cartilaginous rather than bony) begin well
short of the sole, allowing them to be retracted whilst
the sole is being used as a hoof. By extending its toes,
a K'kree can improve its ability to feel the ground or
even manipulate objects.

K'kree feet are capable of limited gripping and
significant changes of shape, making them much more
sure-footed in rough terrain than might be expected.
The ability to grip objects with their fees is not sufficient
to manipulate anything complex but it does allow an
item to be held ready in a middle foot whilst the K'kree
stands on the other three and can be used to secure
a K'kree in low gravity. This gives rise to the ability to
rush through a starship or installation with no artificial
gravity, using whatever hand and footholds present
themselves. The effect can be amusing or utterly
terrifying for observers depending on why the K'kree is
moving in such haste.

K'kree have two genders, male and female, and give
birth to live young. Family groups usually comprise a
male and on average four females, with additional non-breeding family members of both sexes. This family unit
is the building block of K'kree society and has political
as well as social significance. Herds are built up of
multiple families owing allegiance to the herd's leaders
through layers of sub-leaders.

It is widely believed that the K'kree underwent rapid
evolutionary development as a result of disaster
striking their homeworld of Kirur. A supernova event in
nearby space caused significant ecological and climate
changes, forcing the surviving K'kree to develop in
response. Sophisticated tool use and the ability to
communicate complex plans allowed the K'kree to turn
the tables on the predators that had previously kept their
numbers down. From semi-intelligent herd creatures and
prey for their world's carnivores, the K'kree became first
warriors and then exterminators.

The social order of the K'kree was established in this
time. The most successful warriors and leaders in the
fight against the carnivores became lords of the K'kree
herds. Since then, physical prowess and charisma
never went out of fashion. Those who can protect a
family and their herd are the most attractive mates and
rise to positions of power according to abilities and
family connections. Weaker individuals are relegated
to the fringes of the herd and are to some extent
considered expendable.

At the same time as the K'kree were evolving
intelligence, at least one carnivorous species on their
homeworld of Kirur was undergoing the same process.
The result was a long period of warfare that stimulated
technological growth on both sides. Although the
K'kree gained the upper hand, their enemies developed
primitive spaceflight technology before their final doom
became apparent. Some were able to escape to Kirur's
moon where they built a colony. Eventually the K'kree
followed them there and exterminated their foes at last.

The name of this enemy is not known. It seems that
the early K'kree were not content with eradicating them
but wanted to destroy even their memory. Today they
are simply known as G'naak like all other meat-eaters,
although those with a familiarity with K'kree speech
claim to detect a slight change in inflection when this
particular species of vermin are mentioned. Outsiders
refer to the K'kree's great foe as the Kirrixurians but
generally find it safest not to mention them at all – by
any name – when dealing with K'kree.

## SOCIETY

Once they had become the dominant society of their
homeworld and removed the G'naak threat from their
moon, there was less impetus for the K'kree to develop
technology and move away from the free-roaming
lifestyle of their ancestors. Progress did occur but was
balanced by social conservatism in a way that resulted
in cultural features being retained where other species
would have forgotten them. Among these traditions was
the highly complex caste system of the ancient K'kree,
based upon dominance of a leader and value to the herd of an individual. Although at times not well fitted
to interstellar society, this system has survived to the
present day and is unlikely to be altered much by the
passing of time.

The caste system is subtle and contains many nuances
too complex to be understood by non-K'kree but in
broad terns there are four commonly understood
echelons within K'kree society. Only males have caste;
females are casteless until they join the household of
a husband. Outsiders consider casteless unmarried
females to be grouped with outcast males and orphans
in the 'casteless' category, although there are many
distinctions – one unmarried female will be treated
differently to another for reasons not immediately
apparent to non-K'kree.

Within casted society, the lowest status group is
generally referred to as 'servants' by non-K'kree. The
servant caste includes some actual servants but is
mostly made up of physical workers and those whose
professions traditionally require little or no education.
Thus despite a modern factory worker, functionary or
farmer needing to be highly knowledgeable about their
field, they will belong to the 'servant' caste and be
considered of low importance in K'kree society.

Educated professions traditionally formed the
'merchant' caste, including scientists, technicians,
administrators and actual merchants. In ancient times
a K'kree needed a certain level of wealth and status
to enter an educated profession, so these positions
became hereditary. Nothing has changed; despite it
possible to provide a good education and chances of
advancement in society, the very idea is ridiculous to a
K'kree. Caste determines caste and other requirements
such as education must be provided to permit the next
generation to maintain their status.

The highest caste is commonly referred to as 'nobles'
by outsiders and includes military commanders as
well as diplomats, governors and those few who have
transcended the upper boundaries of the merchant
caste. Social mobility in a downward direction is not
uncommon and is a constant threat to any K'kree family
struggling to maintain its status. Upward movement is
much rarer but does happen. Sometimes this is due to a
K'kree emerging as a leader in a crisis or being rewarded
for actions that impressed superiors. Others have
become so successful in their field they have ceased to
be merchants and become nobles. K'kree society has
many wealthy traders within the merchant caste but the
leaders of a major commercial or industrial group will be
nobles rather than merchants. The defining point seems
to be where a K'kree ceases to carry out the function of
his caste and instead commands those who do.

- Casteless K'kree are essentially expendable. They
  include unmarried females and males who are not
  part of a casted household.
- Servants serve and support the herd by undertaking
  work that may require specific skills but involves
  little decision-making and thus no real understanding
  of wider issues. The servant caste is sometimes
  described using a K'kree word that translates as
  _those who obey the Steppelord in all things_.
- Merchants are the backbone of the herd's economic,
  scientific, technical and political life. They are
  expected to obey their superiors without question
  but know their business sufficiently well as to be
  able to carry out orders effectively even in complex
  situations. Their title reflects their importance in
  K'kree society; it can be translated as _those who are_
  _the herd_.
- Nobles lead and govern. The least important of them
  handle specific tasks on behalf of the herd. More
  senior nobles lead the herd or represent its interests
  in diplomatic relations with other powers. There are
  numerous titles for nobles, varying with importance
  and specific areas of authority.

Social organization begins with the 'little family',
which can contain as few as half a dozen individuals.
The caste of the family is determined by its dominant
male. Other family members include the male's wives
and children, with some unmarried males, usually
related to the dominant male. They carry out whatever
functions are required, from drivers and guards to clerks
and workers. There may also be a few unmarried adult
females but normally a female is promised in marriage
to a suitable male before she comes of age and marries
into his family as soon as she is old enough. There
is a little leeway for those who cannot do this due to
circumstances and an unmarried female eventually
becomes casteless and is driven out of her family.

Several little families are usually grouped into a 'big
family'. Many members will be related to other little
families within the grouping and often it is obvious when a child is born whose little family she will eventually
marry into. A big family will contain several dominant
males and their close associates, with one of the males
leading the extended family. The caste of a whole
extended family will be the same; big family is the
highest social grouping where this is the case.

Several big families, of differing caste, are organised
into a 'field-family' – more commonly referred to as a
herd. A herd will be led by a noble K'kree and supported
by big families from the merchant and servant castes. A
herd might have some casteless individuals associated
with it; these have a nebulous status, not part of the
herd but receiving protection and condescending
support from it. They are likely to be sacrificed in a
crisis and are sometimes referred to as 'decoys' or
similar terms implying they are kept around to distract
predators (possibly of a metaphorical sort) from the
herd's real members.

Multiple herds are grouped into clans, sometimes
referred to as 'pasture-families'. A clan will have a
dominant noble (clanlord) who rules the clan as a whole,
plus additional noble families who carry out specific
tasks as well as the ruling nobles of the member herds.
A small K'kree city is the modern equivalent of a clan
and will be governed by a clanlord. Larger cities may
contain several clans and will either be ruled by the
most senior clanlord or, if large enough, be considered a
'plain-family'.

Multiple clans or small cities will be grouped into a
'plain-family' led by a senior noble and several such
plain-families make up the equivalent of a K'kree
nation. These groupings are ruled by an individual
known as a Steppelord, with subordinate plain-families
led by nobles holding the title of Lieutenants-of-the-Steppelord. Above the Steppelords are planetary
governors and rulers of groups of worlds, while above
them stands the Grand Steppelord of the Two Thousand
Worlds, ruler of all K'kree.

### K'kree Groupings

```
Grouping Number of K'kree Ruler
Little Family 6–24 Dominant Male
Big Family 100–200 Dominant Male
Herd 300–800 Herdlord
Clan 1000+ Clanlord
Plain-Family 10,000+ Lieutenant-of-the-Steppelord
Steppe-Family 25,000+, often far more Steppelord
All K'kree on a given world Possibly millions Lord-Of-Steppelords
All K'kree Grand Steppelord of the 2,000 Worlds
```

Politics between nobles of similar rank can be complex
but all noble K'kree understand the subtle nuances
that dictate their exact place in the hierarchy of nobles.
One Steppelord may rule a far larger area and number
of K'kree than another and will be ranked more highly
despite an outsider potentially not being able to tell
the difference. Attempts have been made by human
observers to assign additional levels of Steppelordship
based on the nature and size of holdings but the K'kree
themselves do not need such things; everyone knows
their place – and everyone else's place too.

## SOCIAL VALUES

The herd mentality is strong in all K'kree and defines
many of their social and cultural values. Their social
hierarchy is so deeply ingrained that few K'kree ever
wonder what it would be like to question authority, let
alone do it. The head of a household is the absolute
master of its members and his superior in the herd
or clan holds absolute power over him. The word of a
distant Steppelord is law throughout his entire domain.

This respect for authority extends to the worship of
ancestors. They are not gods in the usual sense but a
combination of cultural heroes and paragons of how a
K'kree should live their life. The ancestors showed the
present generation how to live and struggled against
great odds to ensure the survival of the species. This is
true throughout all of K'kree history – most families have
favored ancestors they particularly venerate but respect
all those who came before, right back to the dawn of
K'kree civilization.

This mentality is in part due to the status of K'kree as
prey animals. Most intelligent species are predators to
at least some extent and have deep-rooted instincts that
tell them they can dominate other creatures. The K'kree
think prey-if-we-let-ourselves-be-prey and are constantly
mindful that if they fail to impose their will on the
universe they will once again become food for G'naak.

K'kree responses to problems are thus often rather
extreme. Once a threat crosses the threshold to become
significant then it must be stomped out of existence;
there is no middle ground. An intelligent predator tends
to think – at an instinctive level – in terms of 'not hungry
right now, no need to do anything until I am' whereas
the K'kree mindset is more like 'that thing will kill me
and eat me when it gets hungry, which will happen
sooner or later'. This refusal-of-prey-status mindset was
one of the fundamental changes the K'kree underwent,
and drives their response to almost every situation.

K'kree are highly social and cannot function without the
proximity of their kind. They display great hospitality
to strangers, providing those strangers are considered
friendly. Other K'kree almost always fall into this
category, as do some other species. Their property
is subject to an unusual system of family ownership

- which essentially means the family head owns

everything and grants its use to his subordinates – with
varying degrees of communal availability.

It is quite normal for a member of a different family
to simply take items without asking but someone who
failed to return or replace them would be breaking the
social code, which is virtually unthinkable. Likewise,
taking something that is needed or which the owning
family considers 'not available' is also a major breach
of social norms. Exactly how outsiders are to know what
is available for communal use and what is not, is a
question that has baffled non-K'kree for many years.

K'kree have a pathological hatred of carnivores and
omnivores who have not converted to a herbivorous
diet. Being an eater of meat means being G'naak and
G'naak are the enemy. There are no exceptions and
there is no tolerance. K'kree can detect faint traces of
pheromones that indicate recent meat-eating, so anyone
who has consumed an animal in the past few days will
experience the 'G'naak reaction'. This is an instinctive
unease or revulsion, depending on how strongly the
Traveller smells of flesh consumption. Some K'kree can
fail to recognize the cause of their unease and may not
immediately realise they are in the presence of G'naak.
Those that do tend to react violently.

A common rule of thumb is to avoid meat products for
30 days before going anywhere near K'kree, although
it is rumored there are those who can tell if a person
has ever eaten meat. It is not clear if these claims are
true or just an excuse for K'kree zealots to attack anyone
they please.

## PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAITS

The following traits are common to almost all K'kree and
should be borne in mind when portraying members of
the K'kree race.

Herd Creatures: K'kree are more than just gregarious. They
quite literally cannot cope with being alone and will suffer
severe mental trauma leading to madness if separated
from others of their kind. The minimum number of K'kree
for comfort is four; any less is not a herd.

### Group Identity

K'kree think of themselves as a member
of a family, herd, clan and so forth, rather than an
individual. Property belongs to the group rather than an
individual. A visit from a K'kree means a visit from his
whole family, which can be two dozen individuals.

### Claustrophobia

K'kree are extremely claustrophobic and
cannot stand being confined. Even being in a large room
with the door shut is troubling to them. Their vehicles
and structures are large and open, often with the
capability to retract walls.

### Conformity

There is virtually no concept of individuality
or individual worth in K'kree society and little deviation
from social norms is permitted. A K'kree who does not
want to venerate his ancestors and do the bidding of the
Steppelord is worthless and will be cast out from the
herd or even killed.

### Veneration of Ancestors and the Environment

K'kree
honor their ancestors with many complex rituals and
are highly respectful of the natural world. They find most
'planet-taming' operations at best distasteful (except
the massacre of predators; that is right and proper) and
are moved to anger by construction projects that destroy
beautiful grassy plains.

### Conservatism

K'kree are conservative to the point of
being violently reactionary. Traditional dress, weapons
and modes of speech are favored wherever possible.
K'kree warriors will happily use the latest weaponry but
will like it a lot better if it is styled after the armament
of their forefathers.

Militant Vegetarianism: K'kree view all meat-eaters as
G'naak and there are only three kinds of G'naak – those
that have already been exterminated, those that can
be exterminated in the near future and those powerful
enough that the K'kree must wait for the day they are
strong enough. Interstellar political relations are based
on this concept – every meat-eater in the universe must
be converted to a vegetarian diet or wiped out. Those
that will not change will someday be destroyed but in
the meantime the K'kree must co-exist and perhaps
even cooperate.

## DAILY LIFE

K'kree live and work in social groups and although
society has become urbanised the wide plains of Kirur
still hold a spiritual attraction. Cities are usually small,
with dispersed buildings and open spaces between and
if a larger metropolis exists it typically takes the form
of a network of smaller groupings. The arrangement is
similar to the way a herd is made up of multiple self-contained families and indeed larger communities are
sometimes referred to as herds-of-cities.

Structures in general tend to be low and broad, and
spaced out allowing the horizon to be seen between
them. Greenery is common and enclosed spaces are
built on an open-plan basis as far as possible. K'kree like
natural light, which can be provided by large windows or
retractable outside walls. K'kree need to be able to see,
hear and smell others of their kind and artificial attempts
to create the illusion of a herd have generally failed. Thus
K'kree workspaces tend to be very open and their tasks designed to allow movement. This is partly for the comfort
of the individual – K'kree evolved from wandering grazers
and do not like being still for long – but also for the
benefit of colleagues. Having a fellow K'kree wander by
from time-to-time is comforting and helps keep workers
relaxed and productive.

K'kree do settle airless worlds and other planets that
require a sealed environment but even with large indoor
parks they find the lack of natural wind and open spaces
to be draining. Society is noticeably more fractious than
on Kirur-like worlds and the situation is even worse
aboard spacecraft or orbital installations. K'kree are
capable of operating these for an extended period but
it is unnatural to them. Whereas humans and other
sophonts have taken to life in space and to some extent
made it their home, K'kree are always out of place away
from the plains of a Kirur-like world.

Many daily tasks are performed by robots or semi-autonomous machines. K'kree are big creatures,
ill-suited to crawling along an inspection conduit or
undertaking work close to the ground. Thus K'kree of all
castes grow up using robotic assistants and tend to have
an aptitude for it. The exception is those lucky few who
live a traditional lifestyle on a mid or low-tech world.

## THE TWO THOUSAND WORLDS

Today's K'kree control a large interstellar state,
organised on the same family/herd/herd-of-herds
basis as their ancient existence on Kirur. Segments
of a herd, or a single family group, can be broken
off and dispatched to carry out a task but K'kree are
uncomfortable unless close to their herd and distressed
by any situation where they are not in close proximity
to others of their kind. Thus it is families led by an
individual rather than individuals themselves who
conduct the business of the K'kree and their response to
a situation is often on a very large-scale basis.

The politics of the K'kree race as a whole tend to
reflect their origins. It is a fact of life that the odd herd
member will fall to predators and someone who cannot
protect close family members is of little value to the
herd. However, when it is possible to deal with a threat
or when the herd as a whole is threatened the K'kree will
act decisively, sometimes to a genocidal extreme.

The region dominated by the K'kree is known in their
own language as T't'tkahk Xeng Kirr , which translates as
the Two Thousand Worlds. This is a metaphorical rather
than precise figure; it is not clear how many star systems
the K'kree rule nor how many planets are inhabited
within them. The Two Thousand Worlds is one of the
oldest political entities in Charted Space and one of
the most stable. There have been occasional rebellions
against the Steppelords but these are rare and localised.

Those who might challenge the authority of the Grand
Steppelord are either eliminated or exiled to frontier
regions and reabsorbed into mainstream K'kree society
after a few hundred years or collapse due to internal
dissent. At the present time there is one such group
of major importance – known as the Lords of Thunder

- and possibly other, smaller polities along the fringes

of K'kree space. It is widely thought that these exiled
groups serve a similar purpose in the grand scheme
as casteless males do in a herd – predators will fall on
them first, in which case nothing has been lost.

K'kree Language
The K'kree language, like their society, is wrapped
up in tradition to the point where it changes only
imperceptibly over time. This has advantages; all
K'kree speak the same language with virtually no
cultural drift despite living on worlds dozens of
parsecs apart. On the other hand, K'kree routinely
use archaic phrases in a context that did not exist
when their language was formulated, leading to
sometimes clumsy and roundabout wording. The
introduction of words from other languages is
anathema to K'kree, no matter how much simpler
the situation would be if they are adopted.

The K'kree language includes a number of glottal
stops, clicks and other sounds suited to K'kree
mouthparts but difficult for most other species
to pronounce. This is a source of pride to most
K'kree, who see their native tongue as too good for
anyone but them to use.

The K'kree call their language !xeng'ri but since
most humans and other intelligent species cannot
even pronounce its name, it is typically known
by the title of its commonest dialect. Thus most
humans think the K'kree tongue is named Raxkiir
and may be unaware that this is a dialect of the
true K'kree language.

## THE MILITARY

All K'kree males have an obligation to serve as warriors
for a time upon coming of age. It is usually during
this period that a young K'kree establishes his status
and demonstrates fitness to lead a family or hold an
important position within one. Not all K'kree warriors
serve in the armed forces of the Two Thousand Worlds,
however. Some are taken into the service of a clanlord
or Steppelord where they may be soldiers or bodyguards
depending on the needs of their master.

A K'kree enters his military service at a level determined
by his caste. Servants make up the rank-and-file,
merchants begin training to become low-level leaders (equivalent to a sergeant or junior lieutenant in human
terms) or provide specialist capabilities. Nobles
are trained to lead or, occasionally, join extremely
prestigious units where every rifleman is the son of a
clanlord. Such forces are expected to routinely perform
legendary actions and tend to suffer high casualties
trying to live up to this expectation.

Units are occasionally formed from casteless males,
usually for near-suicidal operations. This kind of service
is actually desirable to many casteless K'kree as it offers
a win-win situation; either the warrior distinguishes
himself sufficiently that he is elevated into casted
society or he dies in the service of the herd and earns
his place in the ancestor-songs. This is a far better
outcome than lingering on in the misery of 'walking in
the footprints of the herd' as the saying goes.

K'kree are large creatures, not well suited to operating
vehicles or engaging in urban combat. They are,
however, excellent infantry (or perhaps a sort of
cavalry). Their quadruped hindquarters provide a highly
stable firing platform for dextrous front arms and their
unassisted movement over open ground is second to
none. K'kree infantry typically use weapons based on
those of the ancient past. Lances are the traditional
armament of the clan warrior and used for more than
ceremonial purposes. Modern versions of the lance are
issued to many warriors, useful in hand to hand combat
but also incorporating a laser rifle. However, traditional
lances are also carried into action, along with a small
shield which is carried on a sling when not in use.

### Military Organization

The organization of the K'kree military reflects a strange
mix of traditionalism and pragmatic adaptation to the
modern combat environment. The emphasis is on small
groups of warriors on foot earning glory and status by
engaging the enemy at close quarters but given all
possible support with advanced technology.

There is no prescribed organization in the manner of
more formal militaries but strict traditional precedents
must be followed, which leads by a different route to
a certain uniformity. The lowest level of organization
is a small force known as a 'fighting-band' of 4–10
servant-class warriors led by a merchant-caste leader. A
fellow member of such a band is a friend for life, with
a bond known as 'sharing grass', which refers both to
eating together and being laid to rest in the same grave.
Members usually carry a mix of equipment, although any
given band will be biased towards an infantry function
such as close assault, long-range sharpshooting or other
specific battlefield task.

Several bands are assigned to a noble-caste leader and
his immediate retinue, creating a 'warring-band', which
is roughly equivalent to a platoon in other militaries.
The warring-band leader's retinue normally contains
one or more drone operators, who control and direct
robotic fire support platforms. Equipment for doing so is
designed to be used on the move, even at full gallop, so
an entire warring-band can undertake rapid maneuvers
or a headlong charge at the enemy. Warring bands can
contain up to six or more fighting-bands, with a typical
strength of about 30–40 K'kree and an average of one or
two fire support platforms per fighting-band.

Warring-bands are a near-permanent formation, although
there are no regulations regarding this. Once formed,
a fighting-band and the warring-band it is part of are
bonded and no right-thinking K'kree (which is all of
them, except filthy outcasts) would consider breaking
that bond. Thus rather than being formally designated in
the manner of other militaries, a warring-band would be
recorded and spoken of as 'the warring-band of Aux!vur,
which is known to favor rapid maneuver and correctly
equipped for this style of combat'. Such designations
make operational planning a long-winded and complex
matter but are traditional, and that is far more important
than efficiency.

Joining a fighting-band or a warring-band is an occasion
for great ceremony, for the young K'kree is joining a
family he will leave only upon death – and perhaps even
then he will lie forever beneath the bloody grass with
his comrades. All members of the band share in its
tasks and its fights, its glory and its shame. The deeds
of former members are recalled in tales and rituals, and
there is intense pressure to live up to the legends of
those who went before.

Fleeing a battle, for example, does not merely dishonor
the warrior; it also brings disgrace upon his comrades
and all their forebears. A band whose story ends in
gallant disaster or heroic folly might be remembered with a certain condescension but a band that collapses
in surrender or panic undoes all gallant deeds of the
band right back to its formation. The ultimate disgrace
is to be brought before the warleaders for dissolution of
the band. Most warriors would beg to be allowed to stay
together and undertake a suicide mission to salvage the
honor of their forebears, even if their own is forfeit.

'Redemption-bands' of this sort are useful as shock
troops or cannon fodder, although wise commanders
are more likely to use them as rearguards in a retreat
or to carry out missions from which no retreat is
possible. The use of such troops has given rise to the
K'kree reputation for mindless fanaticism, although the
motivations of the warriors involved are more complex.
A redemption-band might be sent well forward to trip
a suspected ambush, identify a minefield or similar
hazard in the most basic manner possible, or clear a
path through mines and obstacles with their bodies.
Alternatively, they may be ordered to strike at a target
that could not be reached by troops who hoped to
get out again. Their ferocity is legendary and their
tenacity goes beyond that of even the most motivated
conventional soldiers.

### Higher Formations

A number of warring-bands will be grouped together
as a battle-force under the command of a more senior
noble-caste officer known as the battling-captain.
Such formations are more fluid than warring-bands
and fighting-bands, and may eventually be broken
up, but some battle-forces have existed for centuries,
rejuvenated by new warring-bands or replacement
personnel. The personal retinue of the battling-captain
will contain additional support personnel and vehicles
plus a few attached small units providing additional
capabilities, enabling the battle-force to function as a
self-contained combat unit.

Most situations do not require much more than a
battling-force, although sometimes more than one
battling-force will be deployed to an area without an
overall commander or higher formation. In this case
precedent, tradition and the reputation of the forces
involved will determine which battling-captain directs
the efforts of the others.

Larger formations are formed at need and dismantled
again when their task is over. A campaigning-force might
be built out of several battling-forces and kept together
as a garrison or on-call formation for some years.
Additional support in the form of artillery, vehicles and
attached forces may come and go in that time but the
core units of the campaigning-force will, by tradition,
remain together as long as feasible.

It is not uncommon for a campaigning-force to be held
ready as a placeholder, at need gaining additional
supports and undergoing rapid expansion into a higher
formation such as a warring-force. Such formations are
normally assigned to a higher commander, providing
an immediate response capability and framework for
the integration of additional units. They also provide
administrative services for support units, which can
create a situation where a campaigning-force goes to
war with artillery and specialist supports that would
normally be assigned to several such formations. K'kree
commanders are quite happy with this; overkill is more
commonly a goal than a flaw.

Large formations are only put together for major
wars and tailored to the needs of the region or (more
commonly) dictated by what is available. Two or more
campaigning-forces under the command of a warring-captain creates a warring-force roughly equivalent
to an Imperial brigade. Two or more warring-forces
commanded by a great captain are known as an
exterminating force. The (very) rough equivalent of a
division, an exterminating force armed with advanced
weapons is capable of subjugating a lower-tech world
and slaughtering its predators.

If the need arises, a lord captain will assemble a
'grand force' for a major campaign. Lord captains and
the grand captains who stand above them also have
responsibility for the security of an area – typically
several minor star systems or part of a major world – and
exert authority over lower-level commanders in their
area of responsibility. There are often no intermediate
leaders between a lord captain or grand captain (or
more commonly, his staff) and a lowly battling-captain
responsible for securing a city on one of the worlds
in his area of influence. The grand captain has the
authority to build higher formations at need, assigning
commanders and support formations as he sees fit.

In general, political leaders are empowered to appoint
military commanders to a level appropriate to their
own rank and may appoint themselves or another
individual (often a younger brother or trusted relative-by-marriage) to the post. Thus a herdlord or clanlord
may appoint battling-captains to command his forces if
he is able to raise enough troops or is assigned them.
Steppelords can appoint commanders up to the rank of
great captain but only the Grand Steppelord of the Two
Thousand Worlds can legitimately appoint lord captains.
However, this authority is often delegated as a token of
trust. Appointing a lord captain without the approval of
the Grand Steppelord, or raising a force that required
command by a de facto lord captain, would be seen as
an act of rebellion.

The K'kree Charge
The terror inspired by a warring band at the
charge is not to be underestimated. Up to 50
K'kree warriors screaming traditional slaying-cries, the ground shaking with the thunder of
their hooves, lance points levelled and lasers
flashing would be terrifying enough but among
them are armored grav platforms blasting away
with laser cannon or lobbing mortar rounds,
weaving in and out of the charging warriors to
shield them from fire and annihilating pockets of
resistance with pinpoint precision.

Physically, this is enough to reduce hardened
soldiers to panic but the physical dimension is
only a part of it. The most frightening aspect of
a K'kree charge, according to those who have
survived one, is the intent. The K'kree are coming
at the gallop, they will not be stopped and they
will kill everything in their path.

Very large forces are rarely needed. Most foes can be
crushed by an exterminating-force or perhaps several
operating in loose cooperation without the oversight of a
lord captain. If a situation requires a larger unified force,
it qualifies as a major emergency and subject to drastic
measures. This means switching from conventional
overkill to space-based warfare, breaking up the
cohesion of the enemy's forces or just plain destroying
them with the use of orbital weaponry. The K'kree make
no distinction between military and civilian targets;
as far as they are concerned the general population of
an enemy herd or G'naak species is a source of more
enemies and a legitimate target for all weapons.

### Military Hardware

The K'kree fight few large-scale conventional wars,
mostly engaging with light infantry and a few robotic
weapon carriers. More serious threats are met with
overkill, using artillery, robotic weapons platforms and
orbital bombardment. The armed forces of the K'kree
are built around infantry tactics, with heavier weapons
tasked with isolating parts of an enemy force for assault
and protecting infantry from countermeasures that
would make them ineffective. In short, the K'kree deploy
equipment that enables them to fight the way they want
to rather than weaponry optimized to bring a pragmatic
victory at the price of abandoning traditional methods.

K'kree infantry are armed with personal and light
support weapons, favoring lasers over projectile
weapons. Infantry are supported by vehicles and
artillery, much as in any armed force. However, the
K'kree make extensive use of drones and robotic combat
devices rather than crewed vehicles to carry their heavy
weapons into action. These platforms typically mount air
and missile defence weaponry to offset the vulnerability
of personnel operating in the open to air-bursting
artillery munitions.

Vehicles are large and make easy targets but their
critical systems are heavily protected to offset this.
K'kree vehicle crews are exposed to severe psychological
stress on a constant basis, as combat vehicles combine
isolation from all but a handful of other K'kree with
confinement in a small (by K'kree standards) space.
Where possible, forces are supported from orbit and
make only limited use of vehicular transportation in
the face of the enemy. For groundside logistics, open-topped or open-sided vehicles are favored, often with
retractable armored sections to protect the occupants
at need.

Ground Combat Tactics
All K'kree infantry dream of taking part in a massed
headlong charge and sweeping their enemies before
them. More commonly, they skirmish in small groups,
much like low-tech light cavalry using horses or similar
riding animals. Groups tend to be loosely organised on
the battlefield but still highly cohesive, as a mini-herd
beset by G'naak must be. This is the environment where
K'kree footsoldiers are at their best; a fluid situation
where aggression and teamwork can overcome almost
any foe.

Space Forces
Some Clanlords and Steppelords have their own
private space forces but most military ships in the
Two Thousand Worlds are built in a small number of
specialist yards, using the best technology available. The
majority of warships are constructed to TL12 standards
and are similar in many ways to vehicles and buildings.

K'kree warships are extremely wasteful of space by
human standards but this is necessary to accommodate
their large bulk and need for open areas. Most warships
are designed to deploy or control robotic subordinate
craft, either as crewed 'herdmasters' controlling a group
of similarly sized robotic craft or acting as a carrier and
tender for large numbers of semi-autonomous robot
fighters. These are piloted remotely from the carrier,
by drone pilots who translate the cooperative instincts
of the herd-protector into a three-dimensional space
combat environment.

### Formations

K'kree often use a five-part formation in military
operations. It is equally applicable to a large
ground force or warring-band on the march and
is based on the ancient defensive formation used
by herds on Kirur.

The Head can be considered the vanguard of a
herd or force. It contains the best warriors and
most potent direct-fire weapons. The force or
herd leader is normally located at the rear of the
'head', well forward to make decisions on the
march or direct an initial encounter with hostiles.

The Body marches behind the head, separated
by a short distance. The body of a herd contains
most of the non-combatants and a contingent of
guards to protect them. In a military context the
body is made up of the majority of fighting troops.

The Loins is the rearmost of the three main
force components. In a marching herd it would
contain some non-combatants and a force of
warriors acting as a rearguard; in a military force
it contains heavy weapons such as artillery and
logistics assets such as supply vehicles. A small
rear-cover force is always assigned.

The Hands are two flanking/screening forces
moving ahead of the main force and out to the
sides. The Hands conduct reconnaissance and
foraging, and are expected to contact the enemy
and find out their dispositions.

When a force deploys from its marching order
the usual system is for units from the body to
spread out and move up to support the hands,
which acts as a screening force to cover the
deployment. The head deals with any immediate
crisis then holds position to become a powerful
reserve under the command of the force leader.
The loins deploy heavy weapons, bring logistics
assets into a defensive position and sets up a
security element to the rear. Once deployed, the
loins component becomes a pivot and backstop
for maneuvers of the main body. In a force
without encumbering heavy weapons the loins
element is usually small but can sometimes
contain a fair-sized body of troops as a reserve
to be committed wherever necessary – or cover a
retreat if things go badly.

An aggressive enemy can be drawn onto the
deployed body by the screening hands. If the
enemy is disinclined to attack, the hands seek
out weak points for the main body to assault,
with elite warriors of the head held ready to
deliver the finishing blow to a wavering enemy.
Many variations on this basic tactic exist, all of
which have a traditional name and long history
of success.

This approach to space warfare is inefficient in some
ways but K'kree warships are built to be tough and
survivable and can often escape a losing battle by
fleeing behind a screen of expendable robot craft. As
communication lag becomes an issue or if the parent
vessel jumps out, robot craft go over to one of several
pre-set tactical patterns. These are sophisticated but
predictable, which usually makes defeat inevitable.
However, once in autonomous combat mode the robotic
craft are considered already lost and always tasked with
causing as much damage to the enemy as possible with
no regard to survival.

This has led to a deliberate 'throw down' combat
technique whereby K'kree carriers launch their fighters
at the enemy, do as much damage as possible under
direct control and then abandon them to fight on whilst
the carrier withdraws to reload more craft. At need,
the carriers themselves can be expended – losses
are unimportant so long as the threat to the herd is
eliminated and crews will obey an order to fight to the
last if necessary. This willingness is often mistaken for
fanaticism but in truth it is a facet of the K'kree psyche.
Life is worthless without the herd and dying to protect it
is preferable to being cast out for disobedience or seeing
the herd destroyed.

Most K'kree warships are large for their role and tend
to be well-armored at the expense of manoeuvrability
and even firepower. Internal compartmentalization is
generally poor, due to the need for large crewmembers
to move around and maintain physical contact with one
another. Coupled with the difficulty of getting such a large
creature into a vacc suit quickly, this makes K'kree ships
more susceptible to damage than those of other species.

As a result, K'kree naval architects favor standoff
weapons such as missiles and remote-controlled
fighter craft. Not only does this permit an enemy to
be engaged before it can close to decisive range but
a ship that is shooting at missiles and fighters is not
putting holes in the parent vessel's hull. Some observers
have suggested that faster and more lightly armored
vessels would be better suited to this style of combat,
enabling them to stay at long range, but there is no sign
of a move towards such designs. This is partly due to
the difficulties of producing a large vessel with enough
thrust to be an agile combatant and partly because
K'kree ships have always been built this way.

For short-ranged combat K'kree prefer large, powerful
weapons mounted in bays and barbettes rather than
turrets. Turreted weaponry is mounted on most ships for close defence but as usual overkill is the preferred
option. Besides, bay mounts allow a team of K'kree
to work together. Control of barbettes and turrets is
normally centralised in one or more chambers, again
allowing crew to work in proximity to one another.

### Naval Organization

The K'kree space forces, like their armies, follow a
feudal pattern. Few leaders below the rank of Steppelord
have significant naval forces of their own, although
many have a few ships for transportation and diplomatic
purposes. Steppelords generally support some vessels
from their own resources and are assigned more
according to their status and local political needs. These
are paid for from central funds and constructed at one
of the major naval yards operated by the Two Thousand
Worlds but are crewed by personnel raised within the
Steppelord's territory.

A Steppelord may send some of his ships to assist
another leader, placing them temporarily under his
command but they remain part of their original lord's
holdings. The permanent reallocation of ships is taken
as an insult or punishment and if it occurs then the ship
itself is transferred but the crew remain part of their
herd. This is not an efficient system but an artefact of
K'kree social organization and traditional values and
changing it would be unthinkable.

The local forces commanded by Steppelords are
augmented by a much larger pool of vessels loyal to
the Grand Steppelord of the Two Thousand Worlds,
either directly or through subordinates. These leaders
represent one of the few changes to K'kree society to
have occurred since the invention of spaceflight. They
have holdings like any other Steppelord but receive
funds from the central treasury. With this extra income

comes a duty to protect the herds of others by detaching
segments of the fleet and either loaning them to other
Steppelords or deploying them to carry out a particular
task under a trusted leader. The curious status of these
leaders, known as lords-of-the-outer-steppe, is such that
there is no embarrassment or dishonor in having their
forces assigned for protection.

The upshot of this system is that every region of space
occupied by K'kree has local forces tied to particular
areas, often on a patchy and inefficient basis, whilst
task forces and fleets loyal to the lords-of-the-outer-steppe conduct major naval operations either under their
own commanders or in conjunction with local leaders.

Naval forces typically follow an organization similar to a
ground combat formations, with a head, body, loins and
hands. There is more leeway in terms of dispositions,
since naval forces operate in a complex three-dimensional battlespace but the general organization of
a force will follow the pattern. Ships are not assigned to
squadrons and fleets like those of the Imperium; they
are assigned to leaders who organise them as necessary
using layers of command and organization.

A 'significant vessel' means any ship with respectable
combat capability, including relatively small patrol
and escort ships. Ships in the cruiser class are rarely
assigned to formations smaller than a herd of the outer
steppe, whilst the big line-of-battle ships are assigned at
the clan level. There are exceptions, of course; a single
major or even capital ship may serve as the flagship of
quite a small force if appropriate.

The capability of vessels generally increases alongside
the size of formation they are assigned to. Since most
major K'kree warships carry a complement of robotic
fighters and can thus provide their own close escort,
there are relatively few ships optimized for the escort
role. This leads to the deployment of all-big-ship forces
at times, with smaller vessels operating elsewhere as
scouts or security elements.

## A HISTORY OF THE TWO THOUSAND WORLDS

To the K'kree, the history of their interstellar state –
the Two Thousand Worlds – is the history of all K'kree.
Occasionally a Steppelord has led his people out of the
Two Thousand Worlds and colonized a far-off region but
as far as the official histories go these groups became
irrelevant as soon as they moved beyond easy contact
range. Those that reject the Great Steppelord's authority and turn their backs on the great herd of the K'kree
are no longer part of its history unless they return as
enemies or come home to beg re-inclusion.

The Distant Past
Creatures that are recognizably 'proto-K'kree' appeared
on Kirur around 10 million years ago. They are thought
to have begun developing intelligence in response to
ecological disasters caused by a supernova event and
by 10 million years before the present were tool-using
cooperative animals. It is not clear when the K'kree
developed full sentience.

The Ancients are known to have seeded humans and
other creatures across Charted Space around 300,000
years ago. By this time, behaviourally modern K'kree
existed on Kirur. They were engaged in a constant fight
for survival against their homeworld's predators, a fight
that might have remained stalemated forever but for
climatic changes that began over 100,000 years ago.
Little is known outside the Two Thousand Worlds about
what tipped the balance but the stalemate was broken
and the K'kree declined in number.

It is thought that destruction of habitats affected other
prey species more than the K'kree, who were able to
plan ahead and move great distances to viable areas. As
other sources of food were predated to extinction, the
carnivores of Kirur targeted the K'kree. Legends speak of
a 'shadowed time of nightmare' from around 100,000 to
30,000 years ago, during which the K'kree fought a war
against extinction.

The first K'kree cities were constructed around 80,000
years ago. These were initially more like defended
laagers where the K'kree could rest and care for their
wounded but over time developed into true cities with
workshops, storehouses and administrative complexes.
Despite the security these new cities offered, the K'kree
still almost became extinct. What saved them was a
combination of desperate effort and scarcity of food for
their enemies. The surviving K'kree were hard targets
and could retire to their laagers, living off stored food,
when predators concentrated in their area.

It may be that confinement imposed by such sieges
was the worst of the 'nightmare' referred to in legend,
especially since herds were cut off from one another and
at times did not know if their neighbors had survived.
K'kree scouts might come upon a broken laager, with
nothing but the bones of their kind bleaching in the
sun. It was in this time that the desire to exterminate all
G'naak became a driving force in the K'kree psyche.

### The Time of Shed Blood

The war for Kirur teetered one way then the other for a
time but as predator numbers fell the surviving K'kree
were able to push out from their laager-cities, linking
together multiple herds and engaging in sweeps to clear
all predators from a region. By -30,000 what had begun
as a small-scale security operation had expanded into a
crusade to eliminate all meat-eaters on Kirur. It is today
referred to as the 'time of shed blood'.

The K'kree were not the only intelligent species on Kirur
at that time. A race of carnivores had also developed
intelligence and the ability to use tools. It is not clear to
what extent the war between the two species followed
the conventional pattern. It may be that the carnivores
preferred easier prey or had reservations about eating
sentient people. They may have tried to make peace
or even cooperate with the K'kree but were driven into
remote areas nonetheless.

The K'kree almost certainly took the view that an
intelligent species of predator would sooner or later
plunge them back into their time of nightmare. The answer was obvious; break strongholds one–by–one and
exterminate the threat. The most remote predator cities
proved hard to access and the predators themselves
underwent a rapid technological explosion as they fought
for survival. At some point they began an incredible
endeavor; an evacuation to Kirur's moon.

The evacuation was a slow process, undertaken with
primitive craft but it went on for centuries as cities fell
one–by–one. By the time the last was overrun a large
population were dwelling on Kirur's moon, unknown to
the K'kree whose technology had lagged far behind.
K'kree written records began around -10,000 and initially
contain no references to these predators. It is likely that
the K'kree thought them defeated and gone forever.

The Unification of Kirur
The cities of Kirur gradually expanded and became
permanent homes as well as trade hubs for herds
following a more traditional lifestyle. A habit of
cooperation grew into the rudiments of a world
government by -8175, and around 1,000 years later

K'kree society reached a recognizable version of its
modern form. This was the result of the 'Law of Reason',
a philosophical and ethical system, which to this day
forms the basis of modern K'kree thinking.

Progress continued and by -4305 the K'kree had fully
unified Kirur under a single government. By this time
they were aware of the predators living on their moon
and the introduction of grav vehicles in -4228 made a
renewed war of genocide feasible. The carnivores had
prepared for centuries and the fight was a hard one with
many setbacks. However, by -4167 the last fortress was
destroyed and the entire species exterminated – for real
this time.

Renewed conflict with the predator species led to
the enunciation of the _Axavktrr!xur_ or 'Fundamental
Principles of Survival', which amounted to a declaration
that all carnivorous species that would not or could not
convert to vegetarianism would be eliminated. Whilst
making perfect sense from a K'kree point of view, this
was a declaration of war – to a genocidal degree –
against almost every intelligent species in the cosmos.

### Early Expansion

The K'kree expanded throughout their own star system,
developing robotic systems for extracting resources
from difficult environments and building outposts to
operate them. The invention of the jump drive in -4142
permitted exploration of nearby star systems, where
the K'kree were not surprised to discover carnivorous
species on worlds they wanted to colonize.

Small bases were built on low-value worlds to facilitate
expansion but the K'kree wanted Kirur-like planets
where they could roam outside without artificial
assistance. In almost all cases they had to fight for
them, although usually against animals that stood no
chance when energy weapons and artillery were brought
to bear. The extermination of carnivores on a whole
world was a lengthy undertaking, undertaken on a
cordon-and-sweep basis. More efficient methods were
available but the K'kree were unwilling to damage the
natural environment; habitat destruction or tailored
plagues were used only as a last resort.

The K'kree encountered a few sentient species but none
that could resist an assault by their armed forces. Those
willing to accept K'kree rule were permitted to live,
albeit under strict supervision. Those that tried to fight
were exterminated.

Contact with the Hivers
The K'kree contacted their first major interstellar
power in -2045, although they did not at the time
realise what was happening. The first worlds of the
Hive Federation they attacked were assumed to be just
like any other G'naak-infested planet, although it soon
became apparent that they were linked by starships and
possessed advanced technology. This in no way deterred
the K'kree – indeed, it may have spurred them to greater
efforts – and they launched a campaign of destruction
and conquest against the Hive Federation.

The war formally began in -2029. At that time the
Hiver fleet was little more than a security force and
unprepared for the onslaught of the K'kree. Losing many
battles, the Hivers were pushed back deep into their
territory and might have faced total defeat.

According to the Hivers, they undertook a masterwork
of Manipulation – with a capital M. The Hivers pride
themselves on their ability to manipulate others, with
specific Manipulations recorded in the same way as
great victories in war by other species. The Hivers claim
they demonstrated to the K'kree that they could, at
will, manipulate K'kree to become G'naak, creating a
taste for meat, and they were willing to do so on a grand
scale. In this version of events the K'kree fled Hiver
space in terror, proving that Hiver manipulation was
more potent than all the battlefleets in space.

The K'kree version is vague and couched in terms that
suggest it would be unwise to ask further. The overall
impression is that a combination of the fighting power of
Hive Federation member races and underhand tactics by
the Hivers themselves necessitated a withdrawal, which
made possible a truce beginning in -2103. A change in
K'kree philosophy permitted the truce to become more
or less permanent.

The Hiver-K'kree war resulted in the overturn of the
Fundamental Principles of Survival, although the Law
of Reason remained intact. In short, not all G'naak had
to be exterminated immediately and if the cost to the
herd of destroying an enemy was too great then it was
not in the interests of the K'kree to make the effort. This
attitude has been paraphrased by outsiders as 'we're
going to destroy all the G'naak sooner or later but those
ones are too much trouble right now'.

### Contact With Humaniti

Although modern K'kree society can seem extreme,
given open threats of extermination towards all meat-eating species, it is a more moderate version of their
original philosophy. Co-existence with G'naak has been
possible since -2013, although it is uncomfortable for
all concerned. This was just as well for the first humans
who met the K'kree, in -200.

Before the Long Night, humans from the Vilani
Imperium and the Rule of Man had colonized worlds
as far out as the Gateway and Crucis Margin sectors,
making contact inevitable at some point. The first
known contact was between personnel of the Galastrian
Metals corporation, based out of Tharver in the Gateway
sector. This produced no new trade opportunities and a
great deal of friction, as the K'kree had little interest in
conducting commerce with vermin.

The human states close to the Two Thousand Worlds
were mostly small multi-planet polities, corporations or
single-world governments and posed little threat to the
K'kree. However, once scouts from the emerging Third
Imperium arrived in the region the situation changed.
Formal contact was made in 103 and the K'kree quickly
became aware that this was an empire that might rival
their own.

The spinward frontier of the Two Thousand Worlds
remained troublesome. The small states of Gateway
included several pirate kingdoms whose raiders were
quite willing to prey on K'kree vessels. At the same time,
the Two Thousand Worlds was reaching the maximum
size governable under its system – and the K'kree had
no interest in changing. Thus interaction with humans
was limited to the occasional punitive expedition.

### The Lords of Thunder

The antics of the G'naak in Gateway and along the
frontiers caused considerable alarm and voices began
to demand a return to the Fundamental Principles of
Survival. This was an unusual level of dissent for the
Two Thousand Worlds, prompted by a feeling that sooner
or later hungry humans would come trailingwards in
force. Better to act now; sterilise their worlds if they
could not be taken and create a zone where no G'naak
could find sustenance, as the K'kree of old had done
when in desperate need.

Eventually dissent became focussed on a leader named
L'lluii!pri'vguurlg, who embodied the Fundamental
Principles and questioned the authority of Steppelords
who would not embrace them. L'lluii!pri'vguurlg formally
declared a return to the Fundamental Principles – on behalf of the whole K'kree species – in 874, a challenge
that could not be allowed to pass. In 885 he and his
followers were exiled from the Two Thousand Worlds.

L'lluii!pri'vguurlg and his people founded
Xuruk'xaar'keer! , which roughly translates to Anglic
as Lords of Thunder. They set up a powerbase on the
fringes of human space, which is sometimes known
as the Xuruk Empire and more commonly as the Lords
of Thunder. This removed the Lords of Thunder from
the official histories of the Two Thousand Worlds. They
appear there only when they do something that affects
mainstream society but it is notable that their own
histories include everything they know about affairs
within the Two Thousand Worlds. The implications of
that are worrying to human and K'kree alike.

## THE TWO THOUSAND WORLDS TODAY

The Two Thousand Worlds is one of the most powerful
and – in some ways at least – unified states in Charted
Space. In practice, the Steppelords are prone to internal
politics. Some will push the boundaries of tradition
and their orders from the Grand Steppelord of the Two
Thousand Worlds in order to increase their status. Others
will conspire against rivals out of disapproval of the way
they push those boundaries. Any significant threat will
cause those involved to shelve their schemes, however,
partly for the good of the K'kree as a whole and partly
because the Grand Steppelord does not tolerate those
who put their own agenda ahead of his orders.

The majority of K'kree worlds are within the TL7 to
TL11 range and thus capable of playing an active part
in the interstellar economy. However, this technological
capability refers to the cities. On worlds with a
'shirtsleeve' environment there will always be a segment
of the population living a simpler life on a semi-nomadic
basis. These herds make use of advanced technology but
cannot produce it. They wander within large preserves,
more or less following – and thus preserving – the ancient
lifestyle of the K'kree of Kirur. Laager-towns exist within
these preserves, offering comfort when desirable but
allowing the herd to camp in the countryside.

The K'kree name for their state is T't'tkakh Xeng Kiir ,
which is normally translated as 'Two Thousand Worlds'
but can also be rendered as 'the universe' or 'the night
sky'. The latter is a reference to the stars that could
be seen from Kirur's surface at night and the former to
the fact that nothing really matters outside of K'kree
dominions. There is no literal meaning to Two Thousand
Worlds; it is a figure of speech only. Usually it is applied to the area directly ruled by the Grande Steppelord but
there are also outposts, client states and enclaves that
are not contiguous with but considered to be 'of the Two
Thousand Worlds'.

The Two Thousand Worlds and outlying territories are
linked by a large merchant fleet. Some vessels are
owned and operated by Steppelords whilst others are
private. Numerous organizations exist that can be
considered a parallel to the merchant shipping lines
found in other states but they tend to be the property
of noble families rather than corporate bodies in their
own right.

Some worlds have non-K'kree populations, all of
whom are required to follow a herbivorous diet. Many
indigenous sentient races within the Two Thousand
Worlds were exterminated and those that remain know
their place – and are well aware of what happens if
they defy the authority of the Steppelords. Rebellions
are few and always short and external aid is almost
never available to these species. Indeed, many of them
are entirely unknown to other races outside the Two
Thousand Worlds.

The Lords of Thunder
The Lords of Thunder are the best-known of K'kree
splinter groups, not least because their home region is
close to human space. Upon their exile in 885, they
moved into Luretir!girr sector and conquered a region to
use as a powerbase. Expansion thereafter was slow but
steady, gradually absorbing more worlds and doing away
with their carnivorous inhabitants.

The expansion of the Lords of Thunder eventually
increased in pace. Outside observers believe this was
a result of early-conquest worlds reaching economic
and social maturity and becoming capable of funding
additional expansion. Encroachments into Gateway
have brought the Lords of Thunder to the attention of
Imperial officials, although at present a large buffer
zone still exists.

Although firmly committed to the eventual extermination
of all G'naak, the Lords of Thunder are willing to
undertake peaceful diplomacy and trade. The matter-of-fact way they refer to eventually wiping out the people
they are trading with can be unsettling but their money
is still welcome in ports across the region. Incidents are
not uncommon however, as the Lords of Thunder are
utterly inflexible in their outlook and intolerant of many
behaviours considered normal elsewhere.

# K'KREE TRAVELLERS

K'kree Traveller creation follows the same format as all
other races, although with a few unique considerations
imposed by their herd-creature nature. The process
of creating a K'kree Traveller generates not just an
individual (the leader of the group) but his whole family
and associated servants. The caste of these K'kree
is considered to be that of the patriarch but they are
nothing without him.

If the patriarch were to die or be killed, his family is
immediately taken under the protection of another. If
an heir exists, he is summoned or formally installed
if already present. The heir might be a son or younger
brother, or possibly a friend of the same social caste. If
no heir is available to take over the family its members
either join another patriarch's family as a group or are
separated to join several. This is a traumatic experience
for all concerned and usually results in a dysfunctional
family for a time until the patriarch can get his house in
order. This is one way a K'kree Traveller can end up with
more family members than he can support or control.

## INITIAL TRAVELLER GENERATION

The following applies to all K'kree Travellers.

### Patriarchy

K'kree have a unique skill called Patriarchy that
replaces both Diplomacy and Leadership when dealing
with other K'kree. This is in part an understanding
of how to control a small herd of relatives and in
part the ability to play the role of patriarch. Leading
rituals correctly, using the right form of address for
other patriarchs with a subtly different social position,
delivering the traditional condescending epithets
towards ambassadors from lesser species... Patriarchy
is the skill of being the head of a K'kree household
and doing it right. It also allows control over a suitably
sized household.

```
**Patriarchy**

Skill Level Max. Family Size

Average Max.
Family Size
0 D3+3 5
1 +D3 7
2 +D3 9
3 +D3 11
4 +D3 13
Every +1 +D3 +2
```

A K'kree can fully control and command a number of
family members and hangers-on determined by his
level in Patriarchy. This increases when Patriarchy does
but some patriarchs are just better at running their
household than others. The Patriarchy table indicates
the maximum family size that can be controlled. For
every additional family member the patriarch suffers
DM-1 to all Patriarchy checks.

Patriarchy checks are normally made in routine-diplomacy situations, such as when other K'kree are
encountered. Success indicates the patriarch has
performed the correct rituals and established the right
social positioning, allowing interaction to proceed
normally. The Effect of a failed check is applied to all
attempts to interact with the K'kree he has just failed
to impress. This will result in condescension at least; at
worst it can lead to serious offence. The Patriarchy skill
can also be used to get a family organised for a task,
movement or ceremony, or any other situation where the
family head is exercising his routine authority.

Leadership and Diplomacy skills still exist for K'kree,
but are used only when dealing with non-K'kree.

Social Standing
K'kree determine SOC the same way as other species,
and it in turn indicates caste. Certain levels of SOC
align with ranks such as clanlord or Steppelord but do
not mean the K'kree personally holds this rank. SOC
indicates the K'kree is of this social level, either as a
relative of someone who does hold the rank or in service
to them.

There are three degrees within each social rank:

### Servant-of-Rankholder

This is the default level. Distant
relatives and those bound by ties of loyalty rather than
kin hold this rank.

### Kinsman-of-Rankholder

This represents close relatives or
those who have served long and well, and are thought of
as almost-kin.

### Rankholder

The K'kree actually holds this rank.

When a K'kree achieves a new social level, he begins
at servant-of-rankholder. Each term he may make a
Patriarchy check at the difficulty level indicated on the
SOC Rank table to be elevated one degree. Note that
increases in SOC are rare for K'kree, so elevation within
the Traveller's starting social class is normally the only
advancement possible. If a K'kree does rise in social
class, he begins again at servant-of-rankholder level but
gains DM+1 on Patriarchy checks for advancement if he
was a kinsman, or DM+2 if he was a rankholder.

The exception is the lowest end of the nobility spectrum;
patriarch of a small family. A K'kree holding this rank is
automatically the head of his household and therefore
the rankholder. At all other levels, the assumption is
that the rankholder is the head of the big family of
which the K'kree's small family is part. Thus a servant-to-rankholder in a Merchant caste big-family heads one
of the lowest-status small-families within the group
and can aspire to being elevated to kin-to-rankholder
someday. After that, he might even come to lead the
whole big family, as head of his own household and lord
over several others.

## K'KREE TRAITS

K'kree make use of the following traits.

Big and Tough: K'kree are much bigger than humans
and can soak up a lot more damage unless a vulnerable
location such as the head is struck. Whenever a K'kree
is subject to an effect that reduces END, whether
through physical damage or exertion, END reduction
is halved, dropping any fractions. For example, a
K'kree who is hit for seven points of damage reduces
END 3 points. END is also treated as being doubled
for the purposes of determining the duration (but not
effectiveness) of physical activity.

Claustrophobic: K'kree are intensely claustrophobic and
will often refuse to enter fully enclosed spaces. If forced
to do so, or upon discovering they are confined, a K'kree
may panic or collapse. A Difficult (10+) END check is
required to enter a confined space. Small spaces like a
starship stateroom impose DM-2 and very tight spaces
like a crawlway impose DM-4.

A K'kree who fails the check will not enter, no matter
what. If already in the confined space, they will wriggle
out with no regard to whom they squash. If this is not
possible, roll 1D. On a 4+ the K'kree will freeze in
place and refuse to move, or else will begin to thrash
about in a panic.

New claustrophobia checks are made every time the
K'kree encounters something unsettling or is hurt.
Noises up ahead or something as minor as snagging a
piece of clothing on a projection can trigger a psychotic
episode – which in turn can make it very difficult to help
a trapped K'kree.

A K'kree leader may make a Difficult (10+) Patriarchy
check to lead his family or warband into the space,
provided he passes his own END check first.

Gregarious: K'kree need others of their own kind
around them at all times. A K'kree deprived of such
companionship is likely to flee towards the nearest herd (or wherever he thinks a herd could be found) or become
either violently agitated or all but catatonic. If a K'kree
is cut off from others by a confined space the effect is
intensified and checks for both claustrophobia and lack
of contact must be made. Failing both will lead to a
mental breakdown which may have long-term effects.

A K'kree suddenly deprived of company must make
an Average (8+) END check to cope in the short term,
with a DM of anything up to –6 if the incident is very
violent. For example, a K'kree who sees his family hit by
a speeding truck is likely to flee in panic immediately
and suffer long-term effects when he realises he will be
forever without them. A Effect of –6 or worse indicates
permanent madness that may or may not be treatable.

In the longer term, a K'kree who is alone, whether as
an outcast or having become lost, may be able to cope
if there is some hope of a return to the herd – even as a
casteless hanger-on at the fringes. Each day, a Difficult (10+) END check is required. Success indicates the
K'kree can act rationally and productively that day
without penalty. A DM equal to any negative Effect is
applied to all tasks on days the K'kree fails the check,
and the K'kree will be nervous, irritable and likely to
rage-quit on any task that seems remotely difficult.
An Effect of –6 or worse results in a collapse into
despair for D3 days, during which the K'kree will just
wander aimlessly, destroy things he has created and
contemplate suicide.

### Speed of Hoof

If a K'kree performs three minor actions
in a round and all three are used for movement (as
described on page 72 of the _Traveller Core Rulebook_ ),
then it gains a bonus minor action, which can also be
used for movement.

## SURVIVING LONELINESS

There are ways a K'kree can survive the loneliness of
isolation. One is to enter a state of temporary madness
known as 'kin-to-the-grass'. A K'kree in this state ceases
to be rational and will do no more than wander around,
nibbling listlessly at vegetation. In effect, he will revert
to the non-sentient state of his distant ancestors.
Revival from a kin-to-the-grass state is not certain even
if the K'kree is rescued but it is possible that once
surrounded by a friendly herd he will slowly regain his
senses over a period of days, weeks or even months. In
some cases the state is permanent.

In a few rare cases, isolated K'kree are struck with what
can seem to others as divine inspiration. Rather than
becoming kin-to-the-grass they become 'kin-to-the-sky',
a rapturous state in which the K'kree can see and hear
his ancestors – both direct kin and cultural heroes.
Only an already unhinged or desperate K'kree would
deliberately isolate himself and try to become kin-to-the-sky but there have been those who made the attempt.
Most ended their days in gibbering madness but a few
achieved the holy state with enough of their faculties
remaining to cope with daily life.

A K'kree who is kin-to-the-sky needs no herd around
him because his ancestors walk beside him. They also
convey their wisdom, which may or may not make sense
to anyone but the holy K'kree. Most kin-to-the-sky are
unable to function as more than wandering oracular
prophets speaking in riddles but some emerge with a
vision and give out chillingly precise advice on matters
they could not possibly know anything about.

K'kree who work in an environment where confinement
is inevitable eventually become used to it or seek some
less upsetting line of work. A K'kree who lives and works
aboard a starship can use his highest shipboard skill (such as Pilot, Astrogation or Engineer) as a DM when
determining if he panics upon being confined. Even the
most hardened K'kree spacer can suffer a panic attack
when boarding his ship and may have to choose between
forcing himself to enter or being left behind.

## NON-K'KREE K'KREE

Very occasionally, a K'kree will, for whatever reason,
be brought up outside a traditional K'kree family. This
results in a status called A ux!Rraak G'naak or 'probably
just vermin' among 'real' K'kree. Species is irrelevant
here; what is important is whether the Traveller knows
how to act like a 'proper' K'kree, which is unlikely. Even
then, the outsider is unlikely to be fully accepted and at
best live at the fringes of a herd.

An outsider K'kree of this kind still has the Gregarious
and Claustrophobic traits, which are instinctive rather
than learned. However, the not-K'kree gains a special
skill called Outsider at level 0 in addition to other
background skills. The Outsider skill can be increased
instead of any event that increases a characteristic
during their careers. Thus if an outsider known
affectionately as 'Little Jim Horsey' to his friends gains
INT+1 during his career in the Imperial Bureaucracy, he
may swap this for a level of Outsider.

The Outsider skill is used in checks to overcome
claustrophobia and loneliness but becomes a negative
DM on interactions with 'real' K'kree. Thus Jim Horsey,
with Outsider 3 suffers DM-3 on all checks when trying
to get along with 'real' K'kree.

A K'kree with Outsider 0 or better makes checks to deal
with loneliness less often than an isolated 'real' K'kree.
At skill level 0 the check is made every D3 days. Skill
level 1 raises this to 1D days; level 2 to 2D days level 3
to 3D days and so forth. In addition, if a check is failed,
the K'kree Traveller can try to pull himself together the
next day with a new check.

The Outsider skill even allows a K'kree to tolerate meat-eaters, although not to consume it himself. At level 1
and above he is not instinctively revulsed by the smell of
meat consumption from another person and a successful
Average (8+) Outsider check allows the K'kree to remain
in the presence of someone eating meat without losing
his temper. Seeing raw meat being prepared or, worse,
animals being killed for food will still be repellent and
those who do not respect the outsider's sensibilities will
cease to be his friends.

Outsider K'kree retain the herd instinct and will
usually find a surrogate herd to join. This might be a
group of Travellers but sometimes manifests in bizarre
ways. The least of these are the acquisition of pets or
robotic companions and sometimes the outsider will be
compelled to collect a particular type of object – which
might be anything from stuffed animals to rare coins.

The Referee should always remember that behaviour of
this sort is contrary to the fundamental nature of the
K'kree. 'Real' K'kree would consider an outsider to be
insane, potentially dangerously so, and there is some
truth in this. No matter what career an outsider K'kree
follows, no matter how successful he is or how high his
Outsider skill gets, he is in denial of his nature. Other
K'kree will hate him even more if he is successful in
denying his heritage and he will always be a troubled
individual. The companionship of a surrogate herd of
mismatched starfarers might be enough to keep him
more or less sane but this individual will never be 'quite
right'. This may drive him to excel in all manner of
fields but can also lead to self-destructive or irrational
behaviour. Anyone wanting to play an outsider K'kree
must be prepared for this challenge.

With these provisos in mind, an outsider K'kree with a
suitable backstory can enter any career a human could,
although there are some occupations that would be
repellent. A merchant or soldier is much the same from
one culture to another but even outsider K'kree would
be unlikely to take a job than requires working in small
spaces. One who spent a lot of time alone in a vacc suit
repairing the exterior of space stations might one day
find himself kin-to-the-sky, which would indeed be an
interesting roleplaying challenge.

## CREATING A K'KREE TRAVELLER

K'kree are created using a similar process to other
Travellers, although unless an outsider is being created
the Traveller will be the head of a household rather than
an individual and gain additional family members.

Use the characteristics and traits for K'kree Travellers
shown below:

Characteristics: STR+6, INT+2, EDU+2
Traits: Big and Tough, Claustrophobic, Gregarious

Note that these characteristics assume a patriarch of
a family is being created. All other male K'kree have
STR+6, but also INT-4 and EDU-4. Female K'kree have
STR+3 and EDU-5.

If the Traveller is an outsider, his SOC is rolled for
normally. It is considered to be 0 in K'kree society –
little different to that of any other non-K'kree. If the
Traveller is to be an outsider, they gain Outsider 0 and
begin Traveller creation as normal for the adopted home
society. An outsider cannot gain wives, family members
and other K'kree as followers.

If traditional K'kree Traveller creation is used instead,
the Traveller's caste is determined by his SOC score
and is unlikely to change unless a Life Event occurs.
The Traveller begins at the level of servant-of-rankholder in his caste. His family's specialist area is
determined using the Specialist Area table with the
following modifiers:

If Merchant: DM+3
If Noble: DM+5

Specialist Area
1D+Modifers Specialist Area
0–4 Service
5–6 Warrior
7 Mercantile/Economic
8 Technical/Scientific
9 Naval
10+ Leader/Diplomatic

Casteless K'kree do not determine a specialist area, for
obvious reasons. Instead they, along with very traditional
K'kree who live a pastoral life apart from spacefaring
society, use the K'kree career on page 130.

All K'kree males, regardless of caste, spend their first
term as warriors, proving their worth to the herd before
embarking upon their intended career. A K'kree's career is
determined by his caste: Servant, Merchant or Noble. An
additional career, known simply as K'kree, is available to
any casted K'kree. This has a very limited skill selection
and little prospect for advancement. Any K'kree Traveller
who can make a case for it – perhaps time spent with
the traditionalist herds of Kirur itself – can serve terms
in this career. It could also be used to create casteless
Travellers, althought by definition they cannot have wives
and usually meet an untimely end as decoys.

### Background Skills

All K'kree family patriarchs (or patriarchs-to-be) gain the
following background skills:

Melee Combat 0
Patriarchy 0
Recon 0
Survival 0

### Terms

Each term, K'kree have similar opportunities to non-K'kree, paralleling the chance for commission or
promotion. In addition, they may gain family members
or extra skills on the Household Development table.

**Promotion** is based upon SOC and assisted by the
Patriarchy skill. One attempt at promotion can be made
each term until the Traveller reaches the status of
rankholder. Elevation to the next social class requires

```

Gain one additional Service Skill an increase in SOC and is very rare. There is no roll for
elevation each term; it is determined only by events.

Household Development
In mainstream K'kree society, some events are almost
certain to take place at key points in a male's life. His
first term will be spent as a warrior serving his clanlord
or – if he is very lucky – his Steppelord. At the end
of this term he will almost certainly be married, after
which his household will develop as he serves more
terms. By the time he is ready to venture to the stars, a
K'kree patriarch may command quite a force of warriors,
technicians and servants, and be followed by his
attentive and adoring wives.

The Traveller gains D3 additional family members each
time he adds a wife. Their nature is determined at the
end of Traveller creation – they might be considered
to be mustering-out benefits! It is possible that family
members may die or otherwise be lost during a career.

Gaining wives is not certain. Each time a possible
acquisition is indicated, a Patriarchy check must be
made. More wives means greater status, so K'kree
males will try hard to gain as many as possible. A K'kree
male who has not yet married will be accompanied by
an entourage of other bachelors, servants and the like - enough to keep him from going crazy with loneliness until he meets a suitable wife.

Additional skills are mandated in some terms, gained in
addition to wives and family members. Both are covered
on the Career Progress table.

## K'KREE MUSTERING OUT BENEFITS

None. Members of the traditional herds do not normally leave until
they go under the grass and those who do are rewarded enough by
having been able to live the traditional life for a time.

This career is normally used for the (many
K'kree would say 'extremely fortunate')
herds who live a pastoral lifestyle on
the most habitable of planets and the
homeworld of Kirur itself. They have little
to do with the outside world and do not
much care about wider events but are
extremely important to K'kree society
as they preserve the traditional 'way-we-were' on behalf of those who must
venture forth in starships and meet alien
creatures. Retirement to a pastoral life
with traditional herds is a reward for those
whose families have given great service,
whilst their sons build a new family and
start carving out their own legends.

Qualification: None. Any K'kree can follow
this career

Servants are the lowest caste in K'kree
society. They fulfil necessary but low-status functions such as farming, carrying
out basic maintenance and providing the
bulk of combat troops. Elevation to the
Merchant caste is possible but very rare;
most servants are content to be part of a
successful and prosperous herd.

Servant-caste K'kree have only two
specialist areas: Service, which represents
supporting tasks such as farming and
vehicle maintenance as well as direct
service to a higher-caste family, and Warrior.
Servant-caste K'kree exist to support the
herd and die for it if necessary.

## BENEFITS

Most K'kree mustering-out benefits are similar to those
for other species.

### Weapon

The Traveller will receive the traditional
weapons of the K'kree warrior; a lance, a short sword (called a hand-blade) and a small shield. The highly
ornate version presented is perfectly serviceable
but more importantly represents the favor of the
Traveller's superiors. It is considered a compliment
to the superior to carry the presentation weapons
into action and bringing them back with the blood
of enemies upon them is grounds for triumphant
celebrations and further reward.

## THE FAMILY

A K'kree Traveller will be the head of a small family as
the basic unit is called and part of (or even the head of)
a larger grouping ranging from a big family ruling over
several small families all the way up to an entire world.
The immediate family of a K'kree patriarch is considered
to have the same SOC as he does, although as kin-to-rankholder and servant-to-rankholder respective to
their patriarch. The final stage of Traveller creation is to
determine the composition of this family.

The patriarch has complete dominance over his family,
who will do whatever he orders. Conversely, he has a
duty to protect and nurture them. He will almost never
undertake a task alone but usually order it to be carried
out then either supervise or lead depending on the task
at hand.

A patriarch's wives do nothing except look after their
children, at least as far as the patriarch is concerned.
How much politicking and infighting goes on in a
family is not a public matter and it may be that some
patriarchs are given good advice by their wives – but
never in public. Thus the skills of wives are not relevant.
Such is K'kree society. Other cultures have words for
this sort of thing, usually uncomplimentary ones, but the
K'kree consider it is the right and proper order of things
and are not receptive to criticism.

A family will contain D3-1 immature K'kree for every
wife. Not all of these are the children of the wives; some
families have a child or two they are raising for others,
either out of social custom or on the orders of a superior.
The herd takes care of orphans in this way. These
juveniles are also irrelevant in terms skills, not least
since their main role in a crisis is to run away.

In a family group there will be a number of adult K'kree (in addition to the patriarch and his wives) who carry out
the patriarch's orders. These are non-breeding relatives
and servants of the patriarch, who may someday be
released from service to start their own families or
even inherit leadership of the family – along with any
surviving wives. In the meantime, they serve as ordered.

In general, when a K'kree patriarch orders an action to be
taken, his skill is used no matter who actually carries out
the task. He is the leader and he knows best; to ignore his
orders because a subordinate thinks they are more skilled
would be defiance and defiance is not acceptable!

There are exceptions, however. When a physical task
such as driving a vehicle or fighting is carried out,
the Referee may allow the skill of the K'kree actually
performing the task to be used but more commonly
warriors or workers in a family are simply treated as
extra hands for the patriarch.

A Patriarch will have a number of useful family members
equal to 2D3 + his Patriarchy skill. Their roles can be
selected as follows.

### Warriors

No more than half the entourage of a noble
K'kree can be warriors. No more than two warriors can
follow a Merchant caste leader and no more than one
can be present in a Servant caste family.

### Specialists

A family may have as many specialist
administrators, drivers, technicians and general
functionaries as the patriarch thinks fit. If he does not
have a relevant skill but one of his subordinates does,
the family as a whole is assumed to have DM+2 to carry
out the task. If there are more than one K'kree in the
family with the same skill, each additional functionary
adds an additional DM+1. However, if the patriarch has
a relevant skill then it must be used even if his staff are
better able to carry out the task.

### Workers and Servants

At least one-third of the K'kree
in a family must be servants or workers. These do not
supply skills but carry out many functions necessary to
maintaining their patriarch's status in K'kree society.

## FAMILY MEMBERS IN COMBAT

A family's warriors and patriarch can be treated as a
small-unit fighting force and run independently but this is
time consuming. It is often desirable to treat the patriarch
and his family as a single unit, with extra abilities.

- Each warrior fighting for the patriarch is treated as

an extra attack at the patriarch's skill level and with
his weapon.

- Warriors will take a bullet for their lord. When the

patriarch takes damage, up to 15 points (after
armor Protection has been taken into account but
before the Big and Tough trait is applied) can be
traded for a warrior. The warrior will be seriously
injured, perhaps dead, and his extra attack is lost.
Only one warrior can do this per attack.

- A servant or functionary can be traded for 10

points of damage, though a K'kree patriarch who
hides among his servants will eventually face
censure or ostracism.

- If a family member is injured in combat in this

way, the patriarch makes an END check after the
battle. If failed, the family member has been killed.
If successful, roll 1D. On 1–4, the family member
has had two physical characteristics reduced to 0.
On 5–6, just one physical characteristic has been
reduced to 0.

- Wives and children are too precious to be treated

this way. Most patriarchs – no matter how sexist and
condescending they may be – would die to defend
their wives and families.

For example, a minor K'kree noble has five adult males
in his entourage, plus his wives and children. For
colour, he decides that two of the males are his younger
brothers, two are unrelated but sworn to his service and
one is an orphaned young male he has been assigned to
raise by his clanlord. As a noble he is entitled to up to
half of his entourage as warriors and one-third have to
be servants. Rounding these figures sensibly, the noble
decides to have two warriors as bodyguards, two servants
to look after his family and one expert – an administrator
in this case – to handle his finances.

The patriarch has no Admin skill of his own, so when he
orders that an administrative task be accomplished, his
expert's DM+2 is used. The servants are directed by the
patriarch via this functionary and can be assumed to be
competent at combing their lord's mane or passing his
wine. The warriors mostly stand about looking tough and
enjoying their status as their noble brother's protectors.

In combat, the patriarch and his brothers are treated
as a single unit, which makes three attacks with the
patriarch's weapons each round. Attacks are directed
at the patriarch himself but if hit he has the option of
trading one of his bodyguards for 15 points of damage.
This will deprive him of the warrior's firepower in later
rounds (and possibly of his brother on a permanent
basis!) but it is the way of the K'kree. Warriors have a
role to play, as do leaders. A wise leader knows what he
can purchase with the lives of his followers and pays the
price when necessary.

The body form of K'kree imposes considerations upon
equipment intended for their use. Consoles and controls
are at a height suitable for use by a standing K'kree
and controls are often dispersed. This is to ensure the
operator has to move around whilst working; being
entirely still is unnatural to a K'kree.

K'kree devices are generally usable by other species
unless intended to be worn. K'kree hands have a
similar configuration and reach to those of most other
spacefaring races. Their equipment is rarely of a
multifunction nature; a starship control station will
serve one function whereas most other species build
controls that can be swapped from one task to another
at need. Whereas a human might sit down at the
nearest console and reconfigure it for astronavigation
or gunnery, a K'kree would consider this unsettling.
It is the nature of a tool to do a particular job, so if a
different function is required then the K'kree must get a
different tool and move to the correct workstation.

# K'KREE EQUIPMENT

### A03/48956 WARRIOR PANOPLY

K'kree warriors wear a costume that is part armor and part
statement of allegiance. The frontal torso is protected by a
breastplate worn over a tunic in traditional colours, often with
forearm guards. A helmet is worn by some but not all warriors and
the rear torso is protected by a garment described as a panoply-cape. The cape attaches to the rear of the tunic but can be
removed. The standard version of the panoply is not really armor
as such but made from sufficiently tough materials as to provide
some protection.

The traditional, now archaic, panoply consisted of cloth and metal
and is still used for ceremonial purposes. A more modern version
is constructed from ballistic cloth and composite rigid materials,
providing good protection from most threats. All nobles are, by
definition, warriors in the sense that they protect the herd and may
wear a more ostentatious version. Alternatively, stylised variants
may be worn, which have vestigial or ceremonial versions of the
standard armor components. For example, the breastplate may be
represented by a small metal gorget or even a medal-like miniature
with no protective value whatsoever.

### VACC SUIT

K'kree do not fit well into one-piece armor, for psychological as well
as physical reasons. Being fully enclosed is claustrophobic and creates
a feeling of isolation rather than protection. Thus for a K'kree, the
Vacc Suit skill is not just about taking care of a suit and learning to
operate in it; it includes an element of mental conditioning that allows
the K'kree to think of their suit as clothing rather than an oppressive,
all-enclosing encumbrance that threatens to crush the life out of them.

Any K'kree forced to don a vacc suit or similar fully enclosed armor
must make an Average (8+) Vacc Suit check. If the Effect of the check
is negative, it is applied as a DM to all actions taken until the suit is
removed. If at any time a Vacc Suit skill check produces an Effect of
–6 or worse, the K'kree will be overcome with panic and unable to act
until the suit is removed. In extreme cases, he may tear his suit off,
regardless of the consequences.

Standard vacc suits are similar to those made for other species, at
least in terms of function and construction, but military vacc suits are
designed to parallel the panoply of the K'kree warrior or noble. They
look fanciful to outsiders and have various projections that can snag in
a tight space... but K'kree prefer not to go into those spaces anyway.

### BATTLE DRESS

K'kree suffer the same problems using battle dress as
unpowered combat armor, only more so. The Vacc Suit
check to avoid panic when wearing battle dress is Difficult (10+). Battle dress is uncommon and generally used only
by special-purpose units. These tend to be small and are
attached to other forces as a spearhead or assault force.

K'kree battle dress tends to be clumsy compared to that of
other species and imposes DM-1 on all actions that require
movement or agility.

### TRADITIONAL

### WEAPONRY

The traditional weaponry of the K'kree warrior consists of a lance, a
small shield and a weapon known as a hand-blade that resembles a
curved and deeply bellied machete. The hand-blade is almost useless
for thrusting but delivers a devastating cut optimized for the 'running
pass' style of attack. Nobles sometimes carry a smaller variant of the
hand-blade, which is still a useful weapon but generally considered an
item of dress. A noble's hand-blade is by tradition exempt from weapon
restrictions – a fact that has caused a great deal of friction on non-K'kree worlds where laws are strict.

The K'kree shield is a little larger than a human buckler but covers only
about half the forearm when held in the hand. It is otherwise treated as
a standard shield.

Both the lance and hand-blade require the Melee (blade) skill for use.
The shield requires Melee (bludgeon) if used as a weapon.

## PERSONAL WEAPONS

Although laser weapons are favored by most K'kree troops, some use is made of slugthrowers, especially in regions
where high-tech weaponry is hard to maintain or even obtain. Many designs resemble traditional close combat
weapons, which is in general less efficient but pleases the K'kree sense of aesthetics. Weapon names are also less
pragmatic than those used by other species.

### LANCE-OF-LENGTH

The lance-of-length resembles a traditional lance and can be
used as one but it incorporates a laser rifle barrel as the core
of the shaft. Power is fed by means of a cord from a small
backpack that will supply sufficient energy for 200 shots.
A lance-of-length that has been plunged into the body of
an enemy will be coated in blood, which will prevent proper
firing, and to counter this a low-powered 'cleaning pulse'
can be triggered with a minor action. The resulting cloud of
vapourised body fluids and small pieces of tissue is known as
a 'flower of battle', giving rise to the term 'raisers-of-flowers'
for those with a reputation for hard fighting.

### SHORT-HAND

The short-hand is essentially a compact laser pistol intended
for use by nobles and those unable to carry a full-sized battle
weapon. It has belt-mounted power supply good for a 100
shots. To 'strike with the short hand' is a euphemism for both
exerting authority in a graphic manner and getting involved in
a close-range firefight.

### HAND-OF-LENGTH

The hand-of-length is a rapid-fire laser carbine designed to
be used in one hand by a charging K'kree. Its internal power
supply will deliver 20 bursts when fully charged but the
weapon is normally powered by a small backpack unit with a
capacity of 200 bursts. A short-hand powerpack can also be
used, but each burst from the hand-of-length drains six shots'
worth of power.

### WEAPON-OF-LENGTH

Incorporating the same highly robust laser system as the
lance-of-length, the weapon-of-length is a conventional laser
rifle. It has a vastly better effective range than the lance
version since it is designed to be held in both hands and
braced against the shoulder. Rifles of this sort are favored
by sharpshooters whereas those preferring to get stuck in use
the lance-of-length. Most fighting-bands contain members
equipped with a mix of both, though specialist bands do exist.

### WEAPON-OF-DESTRUCTION

The standard heavy squad support weapon in most
K'kree forces is equivalent to a PGMP-12. The K'kree
version is just as bulky as human TL12 plasma weapons
but the mass is distributed such that it can be used by
a K'kree without the need for battle dress, providing
the gunner adopts a braced stance. The weapon-of-destruction uses a backpack power supply good for 40
shots and is only considered Very Bulky if the user is
trying to fire on the move.

## WEAPONS CARRIERS

K'kree forces make extensive use of grav-powered
weapon platforms, which operate semi-autonomously
under the direction of a handler. Usually a handler
operates a single platform but at need a skilled handler
can control more than one. A number of additional
platforms equal to the handler's Electronics (remote
ops) skill can be run without penalty. Any more imposes
DM-2 on all actions per additional platform due to the
possibility of confused or sub-optimal directions.

Weapons carriers are designated by names generally
derived from something that happened during their
introduction to service. All have a semi-autonomous
movement and fire control system. If not under
active command they will loosely follow their handler,
weaving around in an automatic pseudorandom evasion pattern. Commands are selected from a menu and/or
designation system, enabling the unit to be directed
to attack the nearest target, the last target to fire on
the handler's band, the heaviest weapon the enemy is
using and so forth.

All weapons carriers have an effective skill that is used
when operating in semi-autonomous mode. The handler
can directly control one of his weapons carriers, using
his Electronics (remote ops) skill instead of the unit's
own programming, although this can only be done
when stationary and carrying out no other actions. The
standard sensor package includes radar, low-light and
thermal sensors, all of which feed to the handler's
heads-up display. Data can then be pushed to other
band members.

### WEAPONS CARRIER INTERFACE

An interface unit can be worn separately or built into a
standard battle helmet or other headgear, providing a heads-up display that overlays data from the unit's weapons carriers.
The interface unit does not allow control of the carriers.

including orders to rally at a pre-arranged point, to defend
a position until destroyed or go head-on at the enemy and
cause as much damage as possible before being destroyed.
Some nobles pre-set their carriers to make a final stand over
their body if they fall in combat. A noble's unit will override
commands from a mere Merchant caste handler.

### FRIEND-OF-THE-LOWLY

The Friend is the most basic of standard K'kree weapons
carriers, using the same ovoid body shape as most others,
with a laser rifle along the main axis. The unit is neither agile
nor quick and cannot keep up with a band of charging K'kree
if firing at the same time but does provide accurate light fire
support on the move. Internal fuel cells provide an effectively
infinite number of shots but movement rate is halved while
the weapon is fired. The Friend has only basic visual and
thermal sensors.

The Distant Lance is an inexpensive fire support unit,
physically little different from the Friend but much more richly
decorated. It carries a laser rifle like that of the Friend but
has much better sensors and targeting equipment and is often
programmed to move slowly behind a band, acting as a sniper
to take out enemy heavy weapons emplacements.

The Opener is a specialist unit without offensive weaponry. It
can be run into a target to deliver obstacle-clearing explosives.
These include small charges dropped onto obstacles and
spools of explosive wire, which are then detonated to clear a
path through a minefield, barbed wire or similar obstacles.
A path 2m wide by 100m long can be cleared, or multiple
shorter sections, and there are enough charges aboard to clear

### GUARDIAN-OF-GLORY

The Guardian has a set of armored shields flaring out from
its frontal section, creating a mobile position of cover for an
advancing warrior band. It is armed with a laser rifle along its
main axis and a rapid-fire stagger laser weapon in an ovoid
turret well forward on the torso. The effect is intentionally
to create the impression of a noble K'kree, cloak flying out
to the sides. The turret has all-round firepower; the heavy
laser requires pivoting the whole unit and can deprive those
behind it of cover when engaging targets to the side. Under
normal circumstances the Guardian is set to weave among and
ahead of an advancing warrior band, although it can also be
commanded to provide cover for a specified individual.

The Breaker acts as an artillery unit. It has a rapid-fire laser
unit equivalent to a Hand-of-Length for close-in defence but
its primary armament is a short-barrelled 112mm mortar
which can deliver explosive munitions. The mortar has an
effective range of 3km and carries enough projectiles for

### SLAYER-OF-SHIELDS

The Slayer is a direct-fire support unit. It has a rapid-fire stagger laser for close range defence but its main armament is a pair of Weapon-of-Destruction plasma guns carried on stubby arms alongside the main hull. The Slayer normally fires its weapons alternately, allowing a brief cooling period. Both can be fired simultaneously but there is a chance of overheating and malfunction every time this is done. The first time both guns are fired together in the same round, roll 1D. On a 6+, the guns will overheat, requiring realignment and repair, which is a workshop job. A cumulative DM+1 is added to this roll for every consecutive round both plasma guns are fired.

# Vehicles of the K'Kree

K'kree vehicles must be large enough to accommodate
multiple K'kree, each of whom is of a considerable
size. The smallest feasible enclosed vehicle carries
four K'kree and any less risks panic and madness.
Similarly, it is not possible to assign a single driver to
a vehicle intended to carry passengers or cargo. Thus
most vehicles are either driven by a semi-autonomous
robotic unit similar to that used in weapons carriers or
are owned by a family and driven directly by a family
member. Groups of single-occupant open platforms are
used in some areas but as a rule K'kree walk short (by
the standards of quadruped grazers) distances or use
large transports to move the whole family at once. Even
splitting a family group between two or more enclosed
vehicles in close proximity to one another can be
distressing, so travel is usually aboard a single, open-sided vehicle.

### Crew and Passengers

K'kree vehicles must allocate five times as many Spaces
to passengers and crew as an equivalent human-operated vehicle would have (so, a K'kree will require
a minimum of five Spaces on a vehicle). This includes
supports to allow K'kree to stand in comfort and
emergency restraints used in the event of a crash.

### Open Vehicles

K'kree vehicles are built with partial sides and rails for
safety, with an open top. A light covering can be drawn
or unfolded over the top for weather protection and is
included as standard on most vehicles.

All K'kree vehicles have the Open trait and reduce their
Speed by one Speed Band.

Combat vehicles often use folding panels that, when
deployed, partially or fully seal the vehicle. This
removes the Open trait and allows the vehicle to travel
one Speed Band faster.

Folding Panels cost Cr500 per point of armor carried
by the vehicle.

Controlled Pintle/Ring Mount
Controlled pintle or ring mounts are unarmored
mountings for light weapons, either operated manually
or from a station within the vehicle. A controlled mount
costs Cr1500.

Controlled Open Mount
Controlled open mounts are essentially a turret
mechanism without enclosing armor. A controlled
mount can be either operated manually or from a station
within the vehicle, and carries a slightly larger weapon
than a small turret – up to 6 Spaces – while consuming
1 Space inside the vehicle. A controlled mount costs
Cr3000 for every Space of installed weaponry.

### VEHICLES OF THE K'KREE

FRONT 3

SIDES 3

Always used in groups, skimmers are open-topped, open-sided vehicles consisting of an oval
platform with a clear windshield and a safety rail
extending around the rest of the vehicle. Most of
those in use are constructed at TL9 and sold in
bulk throughout the Two Thousand Worlds. They
occasionally turn up in other hands, serving as
reconnaissance platforms or weapon carriers.

The standard skimmer has only the most basic
of controls and is designed to be slaved to a lead
vehicle. A simple point-to-point navigation system
is included, enabling an unskilled Traveller to
indicate a destination (either on a map or chosen
from a menu) and have the vehicle carry them
there. So long as the skimmers remain close
together, discomfort is kept to a minimum,
although it is customary to tie the skimmers'
basic communication systems together so the
family can chat or sing hymns to their ancestors
to keep fear at bay.

There is no sensor package but a simple point-to-point navigation system is included, enabling

TRAITS

ARMOR

The Lead Grav Skimmer is essentially the
same vehicle as the standard model but with
better electronics and provision to control
others by way of a base station. It is usually
richly decorated to denote the status of the
patriarch. Most suppliers will offer a deal on
several personal skimmers plus a lead model
and will add custom decoration matched to the
status of the user – senior wife, administration
expert and so forth. If so, the skimmers usually
come with a pre-programmed formation and set
of 'come close alongside and receive wisdom
or instruction from the Patriarch' function
on the control module. Note that the lead
skimmer can be flown directly or act as what is
essentially a drone operated from the base station
it carries. This is the standard mode of operation,
as a patriarch typically has better things to
do than fly his vehicle. Instead, he selects a
destination for the formation as a whole and is
conveyed there in style.

This standard transport vehicle, used
throughout K'kree space, is designed to ferry
10 K'kree. It follows the same general design
as the individual skimmer, with a curved
frontal windshield and low safety barrier
topped by rails or a clear screen. Weather
cover is provided by a retractable tent-like
'roof'. Almost all vehicles of this sort are
designed for autonomous select-and-go
operations but can be driven manually. They
are often used for cargo delivery, without
passengers aboard, increasing cargo capacity
to 15 tons. Like the skimmer, the FTV can
be operated as a drone controlled by its own
onboard base station, or the controls can be
directly operated if this is desirable.

## MOBILE FIGHTING PLATFORM

Somewhere between personnel carriers, oversized tanks
and mobile command posts. This medium-sized MFP
operates with a crew of up to 12 K'kree warriors. Its high
level of automation permits a single individual to set up
movement and fire patterns, and all weapons can be fired
semi-autonomously. As a rule, one Merchant-class operator
will be carried for each major weapon system, plus the
commanding Noble.

Basic hull form is oval like many other K'kree vehicles but
with a greater length-to-beam ratio and tapering tail that
makes the MFP seem less like a 'flying saucer' than some
designs. Underside and top armor are fixed but there are
folding panels in the all-round armor, which allow the
crew relief from confinement and the ability to directly
engage enemies with small arms.

The base section of the vehicle is wider than
the armored section, creating a walkway where
crewmembers can stand and operate weapons manually.
At need, weapon crews can retreat through the folding
panels and close them, using the weaponry remotely.
It is possible to run right around the outside of the
MFP, although this requires stepping over the barrel of the forward-firing plasma gun. This, the MFP's primary
weapon, is located in a limited-traverse mount facing
forward and protected by heavy frontal armor.

Lighter weapons include six laser cannon mounted on
sponsons projecting from the walkway. Two are mounted
on the forward quarters and two aft, on the walkway
alongside the narrow tail. The cannon are on open mounts
and can be fired manually from outside the armor (this is
preferred by most crews) or from the safety of the vehicle's
remote fighting stations. There is another on a platform
where the top of the armored hull begins to round down
into the tail. A sixth light laser cannon, for the use of the
vehicle commander, is located on the command platform
atop the front of the main superstructure. Here, a noble
K'kree can command his vehicle and enjoy the air rushing
past his face – at least until heavy fire drives him inside
the armored section. The vehicle's pilot stands alongside
his master, a position of great favor and no little danger.

The MFP also mounts four anti-missile laser systems.
These are normally controlled by the vehicle's automated
defensive systems but can be fired from a station inside
the armored section at need. One is located on the rear
of the commander's station and one on the aft platform,
with two more on the underside of the midships sponsons
for all-round coverage. These are sometimes used as anti-personnel weapons when the MFP is close to the ground.

# HIGH GUARD: K'KREE

Most starships operating within K'kree space are built
to TL9–11 standards. More advanced craft are available
to those with money and connections but for interstellar
commerce and routine travel a sedate pace is the norm.

The unique characteristics of the K'kree – their size
and need for the company of others – mean that their
vessels are built differently to those used by humans
and other small creatures. A K'kree engineer literally
cannot crawl into a narrow space to find a problem and
if they can physically fit into a tight space, being alone
and confined would make carrying out complex tasks
impossible even if it did not cause a mental breakdown.

Much use is made of remotely-controlled maintenance
units, which can be operated from an engineering
console, and wherever possible an open-plan mode of
construction is used. This means that pipes and wiring
conduits are highly exposed compared to human ships.
Spacecraft crews are still exposed to considerable stress
by the nature of their environment and many K'kree
simply cannot handle the pressure. Some are unable to
even travel as passengers and must remain confined to a
single world or be transported in low berths.

Accommodation is the most obvious area where designs
differ from other species. K'kree need a communal
living area but it must be properly delineated – it
would not do for a mere Merchant-caste family to
wander amongst a Noble's entourage! Thus rather than
staterooms, K'kree vessels use enclosures. These are
not normally fully enclosed, although some have the
capability to be sealed off in an emergency. Enclosures
are rated by their quality, which determines which caste
will deign to travel in them, as well as capacity. As a
general rule, K'kree need at least three to four times as
much living and working space as a human, although a
family or fighting-band can occupy a smaller space on a
communal basis.

## DESIGN FEATURES

The lack of internal compartmentalization within K'kree
ships weakens their structure. To reflect this, reduce
Hull points by 25% for any craft or vessel that carries live crew or passengers. Robotic craft are not affected.
There is no cost saving for this; it is merely the way
K'kree build their ships. This feature should be borne
in mind when designing deck plans; K'kree ships are
frighteningly open-plan by human standards – but then
human ships are claustrophobic nightmare spaces fit
only for G'naak.

Enclosures
At their most basic, enclosures provide sleeping,
hygiene and minimal recreation facilities for a group of
K'kree of the appropriate social caste, as shown on the
Enclosure table. K'kree have little concept of privacy
but need space apart from other families to maintain
their own bonds. An enclosure will be one of two basic
types; minimal or secure. Minimal enclosures have no
protection against depressurization or physical threats,
whereas a secure enclosure will have partial walls (which may be transparent) and the ability to create a
sealed environment with emergency shutters, drop-down
partitions and local life support equipment.

If an enclosure is not big enough to hold a whole family
or fighting-band then it is not big enough. Groups
cannot be split up, except where adjoining enclosures
permit a group to use both.

For small craft intended only for short hops between
ships, installations and planets, enclosures are not
needed. Instead, the K'kree equivalent of cabin space
is used. Acceleration benches for K'kree cost the same
as for humans (Cr10000 per ton) but each ton only
provides accommodation for one K'kree. In addition,
cabin space is required at the rate of four tons per
K'kree. This includes basic sanitary and hospitality
facilities but most importantly just enough space to turn
around, take a couple of steps and 'be a K'kree rather
than a lump of cargo strapped to a bench'. Cabin space
costs the same as for humans (Cr50000 per ton). At a
minimum, a K'kree small craft must allocate five tons
per passenger at a cost of Cr210000. If comfort and
prestige are desired, this increases considerably.

Short-haul craft only to carry K'kree, robotic craft are found in most of the
roles carried out by small craft elsewhere. K'kree do not
question the wisdom of placing their lives in the hands
of robotic devices; it is quite normal and has been going
on long enough to be considered traditional.

Robotic craft follow the rules for the Virtual Crew
software package (see page 64 of High Guard ). Note
that no bridge is necessary if the craft is not intended to
be flown manually by crew inside.

K'kree Virtual Crew packages are not created to replace
single crewmembers but are a complete system allowing
the craft to carry out its intended role without any
personnel aboard. For this reason they take up space
within the hull and are considered a component rather
than being purely a software system. A Virtual Crew
package requires a computer with sufficient Bandwidth
to run successfully.

K'kree Virtual Crew packages allow normal functions
of the crew positions they replace to be carried out
without requiring additional software. A basic operations
package replaces pilots, engineers and astrogators and
thus allows the ship to maneuver (a pilot function),
operate its sensors (pilot or astrogator) and control its
power systems (engineer) without requiring additional

### Common Areas

Common areas are necessary aboard K'kree starships,
bought for the same price as aboard other ships (MCr0.1
per ton). However, a greater proportion of common space
is required for comfort; typically tonnage equal to half
the total accommodation tonnage.

### Shipboard Park

For real comfort, a starship needs an area capable of
mimicking natural conditions on Kirur. This essentially
means creating a shipboard park, which must consume
at least 20 tons. Parks cost MCr0.25 per ton and
require the attention of crewmembers to keep them
pleasant but the ability to run a few paces on actual
grass is extremely beneficial to crew health and sanity in
the longer term. Nobles and certainly high nobles may
refuse to travel aboard a starship that does not have at
least a small exercise garden.

### Robotic Craft

Very small robotic craft are normally termed drones but
as size increases these autonomous or semi-autonomous
vessels become something more capable. To the K'kree,
there really is no difference between a fighter crewed
by sentient people and a robotic fighter directed from a
parent ship. Since it is unfeasible to build small fighters software. This vessel could not fire weapons, however as
this is a gunner function and not covered by the basic
operations package.

K'Kree ships cannot use standard virtual crew or
specialist software in combination with an operations
package. If the ability to operate weapons is desired a
military operations package is requires and a specialized
or advanced package must be used to gain additional
DMs. Non-robotic ships can use standard virtual crew
software to replace some of their crew, in the same
manner as vessels produced by any other species.

### Standard Operations Package

The Standard Operations
Package is designed to replace up to five crewmembers
aboard a craft carrying out simple tasks such as surface-to-orbit shuttling, sensor flybys and cargo transfers.
The simplest of these is sometimes termed a 'Standard
Shuttle' package and is quite adequate for routine work
but requires an operator to assume manual control for
complex tasks. More advanced packages are capable of
dealing with problems like wind shear or using optimal
shortest-time courses far more efficiently than a standard
package and provide a smoother docking, which can be
important in craft intended as status symbols.

A Standard Operations Package can replace pilots,
engineers and maintenance personnel. It can compute
a short course, such as a surface-to-highport route, but
if complex astrogation (for example, least-time transfer
from orbit around one world in a system to another) is required then the course must be externally calculated
and downloaded to the robotic craft. Standard
Operations Packages cannot operate weapons or other
defensive systems.

Full Operations Package: A Full Operations Package
is designed to replace a larger crew and provide a
wider range of capabilities. Full Operations Packages
can replace pilots, astrogators, engineers and
support personnel but not gunners. A full package
can replace up to 10 personnel before requiring
additional Bandwidth and has a maximum capacity
of 20 personnel. Where a standard package can pilot
a shuttle from one port to another and plonk it on a
landing pad, a full package can calculate a course
across a star system then provide orders to cargo-handling robots on how to obtain optimal cargo transfer
times and at the same time ensure its positioning
relative to other craft follows rules of etiquette so its
owners status is correctly conveyed.

Military Operations Package: Military Operations
Packages permit the replacement of any crewmember,
including gunners and screens operators. Military
packages are optimized for small craft and tailored to
their expected role. Packages may be tailored to their
intended role or a more general package may be used to
save costs. Tailored packages give additional bonuses, at
a cost in Credits and Bandwidth.

**A11/58231 ELECTROMAGNETIC-ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION
SUITE (TL11)**
An electromagnetic-environment protection suite is the
forerunner to a countermeasures suite. It contains basic
jammers and electromagnetic warfare systems, which
grant DM+1 to electronic warfare tasks. In addition,
the suite contains ejectable decoys which increase
this to DM+2 when deployed. There are enough decoys
aboard for six uses, each of that remains in effect for
D3 rounds before scattering. This capability comes at
the price of a rather bulky and power-hungry system
consuming 6 tons and 3 Power. The suite costs MCr3.

## BEARER-OF-CARGOES SHUTTLE

One of the most common small craft in K'kree
space, the Bearer-of-Cargoes is designed to
carry out basic interface work between orbital
installations and starships or planetside facilities.
It is entirely robotic, with no provision for manual
control aboard the craft; like most K'kree vessels
it can be remotely operated from another craft or
an installation.
As a freight-only craft, the Bearer-of-Cargoes
has no provision for passengers and no need
for life support or other amenities. It is built on
a standard 100-ton hull, with a robotic crew
facility and a very basic sensor package to allow
autonomous operation. More commonly the shuttle
relies on sensor data fed to it by parent vessels
or installations. It can make long-haul transits
across a star system only with the assistance of
outside course corrections and is thus normally
encountered on routine interface work.

## BEARER-OF-FAMILIES ORBITAL SHUTTLE

Built on the same hull as the Bearer-of-Cargoes, this shuttle is designed to carry
up to 12 K'kree passengers over a short
distance. It is very cramped by K'kree
standards and most find it unpleasant to
ride one. However, the Bearer-of-Families
is cheap and reliable. It has artificial
gravity for the comfort of the occupants but
no provision for the control of the vessel
from within.

## TRADER OF THE OUTER STEPPE MERCHANT

Small by the standards of K'kree vessels,
the Trader of the Outer Steppe can be
encountered within and beyond K'kree
space. Jump performance is very modest,
since much of the Two Thousand Worlds
region is accessible by jump-1 ships. The
Trader of the Outer Steppe is hideously
inefficient as a cargo carrier by human
standards but it is one of the smallest
ships a K'kree can stand being aboard on
an extended basis.

## QUICKENING THUNDER ROBOTIC FIGHTER

Quickening Thunder is a traditional name for
space fighter craft and older designs using the
same name are still in service in some areas.
Built on a rugged 40-ton hull, the Quickening
Thunder would be designated a medium
fighter by most navies but K'kree refer to it as
a 'versatile-combat-craft-of-the-outer-steppe'
without reference to size or role.

Fighters of this type are carried by warships
and deployed to defend installations. Fittings
and control systems are standardised, making
replacement of losses or alteration of a vessel's
fighter complement a simple matter. The
Quickening Thunder exists for the sole purpose
of carrying a fusion gun barbette into action,and
has been constructed in huge numbers;
according to rumor there are thousands sitting
in certain systems awaiting activation.

## FAITHFUL SHIELD ROBOTIC ESCORT FIGHTER

The Faithful Shield is a counterpart of the Quickening
Thunder, built on the same rugged 40-ton hull. It also
uses the same power plant and drives, which leaves
space for later upgrade or modification. Whereas
the Quickening Thunder is designed to deliver heavy
firepower against enemy vessels, the Faithful Shield
is intended to keep enemy fighters and missiles
away from the vessels it is protecting. This is usually
a parent starship or installation but escort fighters
are sometimes mixed into an offensive formation to
improve penetration of an enemy fighter screen.

The Faithful Shield escort fighter takes advantage of
the space feed up by using a dual turret instead of a
barbette to fit an electromagnetic warfare suite. This
relies on brute-force jamming and a steady stream
of decoy launches but can be sufficient to protect a
parent vessel from incoming missiles. The twin beam
laser armament is of little use against most starships
but effective against fighters.

# K'KREE IN TRAVELLER

Whenever K'kree are encountered, whether as Travellers
or played by the referee the same considerations apply.
To others of his kind, a K'kree who deviates from these
principles is not K'kree at all even if he looks like one.
Tales of G'naak in the guise of K'kree are told to the
young and form part of their cultural heritage and no
matter how rational a K'kree might be there is always an
underlying fear that one who is 'not of the herd', either
socially or mentally, might be more than just a deviant.

### K'kree do not deviate from their nature

K'kree redefine
the word 'hidebound' with their strict adherence to
tradition and obedience to the social order. Their rituals
of veneration to the ancestors are near-constant and
have to be done just right. Disrespect towards their way
of life and social order cannot be tolerated. And G'naak
are G'naak. No exceptions, no mercy, no tolerance.

### Solo K'kree do not exist

'Rogue' or 'maverick' K'kree
can only exist as a result of serious mental illness and
cannot be played as rational people. They are also
likely to be killed or else forcibly taken back into K'kree
society if they encounter other K'kree – being alone
causes madness, madness causes a desire to act alone,
both are wrong, wrong, wrong! An outcast or orphaned
K'kree might appear in an adventure but this is a tragic,
troubled and doomed character best suited to be played
by the Referee or an experienced player who knows
where the story is leading.

### K'kree are big

The difficulties of carrying out many tasks
when you are the size of a horse cannot be over-stated.
This is why K'kree make so much use of robotic craft,
vehicles and technical-assistance devices that can
actually get into the places they are to work.

### K'kree operate in groups

Although tasks are generally
carried out by a single K'kree they are not really
performed by an individual so much as by a family or
fighting-band. The head of the group dictates who will
carry out the task and they do the work. Thus a noble
K'kree might describe himself as piloting his ship – and
in his terms he is – but in fact he is giving his pilot
instructions. A single human or Vargr Traveller might
dash to assist her downed comrade but if a K'kree did it
would resemble a stampede of up to a dozen horse-sized
people, most of whom would then stand around offering
praise, encouragement and prayers to the ancestors
rather than actually doing anything to help.

These factors make K'kree both interesting and very
difficult to play. They could be presented as generic
homicidal baddies but there is much more to them
than this. Everything the K'kree do makes sense from
their own perspective, even if an outsider cannot
comprehend what just happened. For example, a
K'kree family might be on the verge of success (or
victory over the Travellers perhaps) and then just...
stop. Orders from their clanlord or some important
piece of tradition that requires rituals and rest before
continuing, might derail an otherwise promising
endeavor. The K'kree would not be disappointed by
this; it is how things are and should be.

K'kree are all connected. Small families are part of
a big family and they are part of a herd and a clan.
The actions of a K'kree family patriarch affect his
whole herd and actions toward him are likely to have
repercussions if they come to the attention of his
clanlord. The curious, loose unity of the K'kree at times
holds back their progress but is also a source of great
strength and can be a powerful factor in diplomacy.

When a noble K'kree arrives in his starship and
announces he intends to conduct trade or negotiations,
there is no doubt – as there might be with other species – that he is there with the approval and backing of his
clan. There are no K'kree 'rogue traders' or con-men
motivated by self-interest pretending to speak on behalf
of a greater power. However, that does not mean the
K'kree play straight by outsiders. There is no shame
in deceiving a foreigner with a rigged deal or insincere
promise and no reason not to tear up a treaty if it is no
longer beneficial.

This is the reality of dealing with K'kree. All their
agreements are one-sided; they do not care about
outsiders unless they are powerful enough to be a real
threat. K'kree will only make a deal if it benefits them
and they will certainly stick to it if it continues to do
so. Internal politics or shifting conditions elsewhere
can affect a treaty or agreement but the same factors
that make the K'kree implacable enemies make them
dependable treaty partners and steadfast friends to
those fortunate enough to win their approval.
