The 36 star systems of Inar lie entirely within the [[Imperium]], with most forming part of a large concentration sprawling across both Inar and Sabine.  [[Inar]] itself, the subsector capital, is not part of this concentration but has easy jump-2 access to it by way of Pecena. Indeed, jump-2 communications with the rest of the sector and beyond are good.

Inar's industrial and economic strength arises in part from these fortunate astrographic circumstances and partly from the industrial power of its major worlds. Foremost among these are [[Starn]], [[Liiri]] and [[Kubishush]], all of which lie within [[Inar]]'s inner sphere of influence.

[[Inar]] is a candidate for sector capital, a fact its duke is keen to remind everyone of. The [[Duchy of Inar]] is the most powerful political faction in the sector, well ahead of its rivals Atsah and Vincennes, and is constantly at odds with the latter. Usually this is nothing more serious than economic and political one-upmanship, but local politics can become vicious and have at times led to proxy wars being fought between the two subsector dukes.

It is probable that at some point the Emperor will appoint one of the Dukes of Deneb as sector duke, with authority over the subsector duchies. Whilst in the long term this might strengthen the sector economically and provide greater security, any such move would be so vigorously contested that it would be counterproductive in the short to medium term. Thus the present situation is allowed to continue even though it is not at all good for the region as a whole.

An Imperial Navy Depot is located on the trailing side of Inar, close to the astrographical center of the sector.  The depot is home to the Deneb Fleet, benefiting the local economy with its voracious need for high-tech components. The subsector fleet – the 257th – has its headquarters at Inar and works closely with the subsector duke but the sector fleet, on the other hand, tries to stay out of local politics. In this, it has mixed success. All major nobles in the sector have representatives at headquarters, who press for assets to be assigned to their regions or compete for naval contracts to benefit their subsector's businesses.
