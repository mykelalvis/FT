Pysadi has been dominated for many years by a religious dictatorship that worships the planet itself and imposes a number of very strict laws regarding religious matters.  Offworlders have been known to unwittingly fall foul of these laws.

Notably, Pysadian law prohibits alcohol. This raises issues since the world is well known for its fruit crops and, while exported fruit makes good wine, that grown on-planet and fermented there produces some of the finest wines in Charted Space. The government has been cracking down on illegal winemaking operations in remote areas and, while this is strictly an internal matter, the lure of big money for Pysadian Atrake wine (made on-planet from Trake fruits) has brought many offworld entrepreneurs to Pysadi in search of their fortune. Recent newscasts about the Pysadian Booze Wars are massively exaggerated but nonetheless offworlders must be careful not to become involved.
