## GAZULIN STARPORT

[[Gazulin]] (AA86887-B) is the capital of the [[Gazulin subsector]] in the [[Trojan Reach]]. It is a vital link between the Imperial worlds around Tobia and Trin's Veil – and therefore the rest of the Imperium. With only two worlds within reach of a jump-1 capable starship there is little local trade but Gazulin plays host to jump-2 ships making the Trin-Tobia transit and serves as a staging point for vessels crossing into Pax Rulin.

The majority of traffic using the port docks at the extensive orbital component, with passengers taking a shuttle planetside if they wish.

Many ships just refuel, conduct business and move on, but those that do decide to visit [[#Gazulin Downport]] find it has extensive facilities.

### GAZULIN HIGHPORT

![[JTAS-01-Gazulin-Highport.jpg]]

The orbital component is known as Gazulin Highport. It maintains a geosynchronous orbit above the downport, which is located on the world's equator. The present installation is not the first highport Gazulin has possessed. It was built around 50 years ago to replace the previous installation and gradually expanded ever since. Seen from a distance, the port takes the form of a thick disc with a huge bulge on one face and several smaller ones on the other.

The central disc contains the main living and working areas of the port. There are private shuttle bays and a few protrusions around the periphery of the disc, which is arranged in a concentric fashion. The outer edges are largely reserved for defence and security installations, with a 'security zone' running right around the periphery. Military and visiting naval personnel are quartered in this zone, which has restricted access.

Most of the central disc is taken up with residential areas. It is subdivided by airtight bulkheads and pierced by transit corridors allowing cargo to be moved into the central areas or through from one face of the station to the other. Much of the station has been filled with what amounts to a small city but some compartments stand almost empty. These are routinely searched for contraband and criminals using them as a hiding place and, in some cases, are kept in a vacuum state to preserve their unused facilities and discourage misuse.

At the core of the disc is the main power generation and life support machinery complex. This is behind armored bulkheads and, like the outer ring, is subject to restricted access. Subsidiary plants are located at strategic points around the highport but under normal conditions the main load is carried by the primary machinery with secondary power plants running at low level, ready to meet heavy local demands.

The 'front' of the disc has a huge, slightly uneven bulge that contains the main docks and business district. Most visitors never leave this bulge; the disc is where people who inhabit the station permanently live and has the character of a small city rather than starport. This is in contrast to the frontal bulge, which is dominated by the main and subsidiary docking areas, a warehouse complex and an industrial district. There are also expensive living quarters around the outer edges of the bulge and an administrative center, which runs the port but not the station as a whole.

At the rear of the disc are several smaller bulges. One contains the main control complex for the highport as a whole, including traffic control facilities. There is also a docking area for military ships and a berthing/ launch complex for defensive craft. The largest of the rear bulges is wholly occupied by a small shipyard run by Ling-Standard Products.

Gazulin Starport Authority operates a flotilla of 10 ton light fighters and 20 ton launches to conduct customs inspections and provide an official presence as ships approach. It is not uncommon for a vessel to be escorted by a fighter even if it is not boarded; this is essentially a flag- showing exercise to remind port users they are being watched and kept safe... or that others are being kept safe from them. Ships that display suspicious or wayward behaviour or ignore traffic regulations typically acquire a shadow in the form of one or more fighters and may have to explain their actions under the guns of the station.

The orbital port itself is protected by batteries of laser turrets, with several large missile bays able to concentrate fire on any serious attacker. These are located on the outer surfaces of the central disc, with beam turrets dispersed all over its surface.

Naval and diplomatic vessels using the station are directed to an official dock, whilst all other traffic either berths within the main docking areas or moors at one of the external stations extending from the frontal bulge. These are reserved for very large ships and equipped for bulk cargo transfers or movements of significant numbers of passengers.

The facilities of the main business area are typical of a Class A starport - efficient and courteously run, if rather bland. Gazulin Highport has little character to make it memorable, although this can be said about many similar ports. A lot of Travellers think this is a good thing – a port visit is usually memorable because something went wrong or took far too long. The main business district can be entered from any of the docking areas and like most ports it has a large main concourse filled with shops, restaurants, hotels and entertainment facilities. A premium spot on the concourse is very expensive, so many smaller businesses are located a little back from the main thoroughfare.

The port maintains a no-weapons policy, although it is possible to obtain permits to bring weaponry through customs and store it until departure. Law enforcement is by means of a private security force operated by the port authority – the same force that mans the missile bays and conducts customs boardings. Its personnel are renowned for their courtesy and professionalism, and the port has a very low crime rate.

The focus of the highport for independent starship operators is the commercial center, where cargoes are traded and brokers have their offices. This is a busy area at any time of day, but rather reserved and stuffy compared to the auction-houses of some smaller ports. Most business is conducted in a genteel manner, often electronically, with huge sums of money changing hands in a most unexciting manner.

Those who want a bit of excitement are directed planetside. A dedicated shuttle dock runs a quick and efficient service to the downport. Unlimited use of the shuttles is included in highport – but not downport – docking fees. Those who do have to pay find the service inexpensive and easy to use.

### GAZULIN DOWNPORT

![[JTAS-01-GazulinDownportMap.jpg]]
Gazulin is a large world with a dense atmosphere, resulting in windy conditions. Highport shuttles are aerodynamic, and easily able to deal with gusty conditions, but ordinary starships using the downport tend to get blown around a little on approach. This is not especially dangerous but does result in the occasional clumsy landing. Few ships over 400 tons displacement use the downport's pads, although sometimes a larger vessel braves the crosswinds.

The downport is co-located with the city of Harussein, which boasts a seaport and healthy industrial sector. The port and its 'startown' are separate from the city, although it is relatively easy to pass from one to another. Locals often visit the startown for entertainment, whereas starfarers are unlikely to find much of interest in Harussein itself.

Like the highport, the downport is divided into sectors. The Gazulin Scout Base is actually a leased segment of the downport segregated by a large fence. Smaller scout vessels come and go on a frequent basis; larger ones are berthed at the rear of the highport. The majority of the downport is taken up with an accommodation complex for the workforce, with a large business and entertainment district immediately beside the landing area.

The landing area as a whole, and each individual pad, is surrounded by a berm to mitigate the events of a crash. Wheeled ground vehicles transport personnel and cargo between ships and the terminal, using secured access points that allow the security force to scan for illegal weapons and other contraband. Ships intending to remain at the port for more than a few hours are moved to a dispersal area once cargo and passengers are offloaded. Maintenance facilities are provided at these areas, although they are not as extensive as those at the orbital port.

Transportation within the downport is by means of electric buses for short trips or a monorail system for quick movement across the city. The passenger system is separate from the heavier cargo transport line, which connects the unloading docks with the warehouse district and the city's industrial facilities. Local transport hubs with monorail and grav- flyer links to other cities are located at the periphery of the port, well away from the starship landing area.

It is clear to anyone using the port that it has been expanded several times during its history. The original terminal is now an office complex and the freight docks are used as additional warehousing when the new, larger, facility overflows. The worker's accommodation areas are of little interest to Travellers and tend to be quiet compared to the entertainment area and associated startown. The latter started out as the original accommodation area and gradually morphed into a vibrant and occasionally rather rowdy adjunct to the entertainment district. There is a clear demarcation line between the port and the startown, beyond which conditions change rapidly in the space of a couple of blocks.

The port's entertainment and business district is strictly run and kept highly presentable by the port authority, whereas the startown is officially the responsibility of the Harussein City Administration. Its nebulous status as sort-of part of the port and slight separation from the city itself means that the startown is not well regulated. The entertainment found there is of a more rough-and-ready nature and criminality is higher. So long as problems stay within the startown, the authorities are not unduly concerned.

Gazulin downport startown is the destination of choice for many visiting small-ship crews. It is a place to blow off steam and have a good time in a reasonably safe environment with just a hint of danger and illegality. Those wishing to venture there are given a warning for form's sake that the startown may not be safe for offworlders but the reality is that it is not very much wilder than the rest of the port. All the same, it is rumored that disreputable deals are made in the bars of the startown and illicit goods can be bought for a large wad of cash. Whether this is true or intended to draw in excitement-seekers in order to make money off them is a matter for conjecture.
