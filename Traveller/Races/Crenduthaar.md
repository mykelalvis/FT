### Crenduthaar

The Crenduthaar are native to [[Ghatsoki]] , with communities on a number of worlds including [[Pretoria]] , [[Inar]] , [Antra] and [[Deneb]]  as well as [[Regina]] in the [[Spinward Marches]]. Their name is commonly rendered as 'Philosopher Kings of Thaar', which is quite apt.  Whilst large, with an appearance most humans find intimidating, the Crenduthaar are a peaceable and highly intelligent race.

The Crenduthaar are one of the largest known sapient species, with adults measuring some 2.5 meters in length and massing up to 500kg. Exothermic, bisexual and viviparous, they share many characteristics of [[Terra|Terran]] mammals, although the young drink blood from special glands in both males and females, and their bodies are protected by scales rather than fur. Their forelegs are modified with a ridge of scales forming a razor-edged blade called a slasher, an adaptation evolved by ancient Crenduthaar to cut the tendons of large beasts on the run and cripple them; they remain formidable weapons.

Crenduthaar are hexapods, with their upper limbs used for manipulation of objects and the lowest pair for walking. The middle set can be used as either arms or legs as the need arises, although they are not as dextrous as the upper limbs. The most obvious feature of the Crenduthaar is their mouth, which is filled with a double row of highly prominent teeth and surrounded by tendrils used for fine manipulation. The constant movement of these tendrils is disturbing to many humans and draws attention to their frightening mouths.

Creating Crenduthaar Travellers The Crenduthaar are nomadic descendants of carnivore/pouncer stock. Massive, powerfully built, with scale-armored hides evolved as protection from their star's frequent flares, with nightmarish, gape-mouthed heads filled with double sets of razor-edged teeth, they can be terrifying if encountered unexpectedly. Despite their fearful appearance and fanged maws, most Crenduthaar are vegetarians, although some supplement their diet with small animals, which they prefer to eat live.

Characteristics Crenduthaar Travellers roll 3D when generating their STR and END, but only 1D for their DEX.

Natural Weapon (slasher, 2D): Crenduthaar have large razor-edged slashers on their forearms which they can use to cripple enemies. The slashers do 2D damage, and use the Melee (natural) skill.

Careers The following careers from the Traveller Core Rulebook are all suitable for the Crenduthaar: Army, Citizen, Drifter, Marine, and Rogue.

The Crenduthaar evolved in an environment where the sun never sets. For them, the dark side of their world is a cold and forbidding place, a haunt of demons and vengeful gods, where the insane and infirmed go to die. All Crenduthaar have an intense dislike of the dark, which borders on phobia. Even those slightly afflicted are comfortable only when surrounded by light, preferably centered in the red portion of the spectrum.

The Crenduthaar possibly suffered from success coming too early in their development. Their powerful bodies made hunting easy and there is no evidence of predators on their homeworld that could threaten the primitive bands. The only real threat was other Crenduthaar, which was greatly reduced by social rules based on ritualised etiquette.

Having essentially pacified themselves as well as their homeworld, the Crenduthaar stagnated and never developed a technological civilization. They are quite capable of understanding and using technology but even those individuals who have lived offworld for years enjoy returning to a simple stone-age lifestyle. The Crenduthaar have essentially chosen not to progress.
Similarly, they are capable of great violence but prefer to live peaceful lives.

This proved to be their undoing when Vargr arrived on Ghatsoki. Crenduthaar oral histories relate how the Vargr enslaved their people and most of the population on Ghatsoki are still under Vargr rule, creating an exception to the normal live-and-let-live attitude of the Crenduthaar. They will kill Vargr without provocation, if they can get away with it, and consider this more a necessity than murder. Crenduthaar are unlikely to have mercy for Vargr, no matter how helpless, any more than a pest control officer would choose to spare the young or infirm of an ant nest.

This tendency is not allowed to dominate Crenduthaar thinking. They will refrain from murdering a passing Vargr businessman in the starport concourse but hatred will be apparent. Some nobles recruit Crenduthaar as mercenaries, leading to the occasional incident among otherwise loyal and reliable troops, and these mercenaries are thought to have filtered back onto Ghatsoki in the hope of liberating their people.
