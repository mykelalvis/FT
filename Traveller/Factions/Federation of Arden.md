The Federation of Arden are based on the world of [[Arden]] in the [[Vilis subsector]]. Arden is controlled by the Arden Society who created the Federation by networking a number of businesses and shipping lines. Individuals in the Arden Society have made substantial financial and labour contributions to make the Federation a growing success.

The Federation works by investing in existing industrial operations, usually small facilities on independent worlds. By bringing new technology and the expertise of their people, the Federation can increase productivity and therefore boost the local economy. This allows them to drive competitors out of business, slowly making the planetary economy reliant on facilities run by the Federation of Arden.

This business strategy is proving very successful. The Federation of Arden already controls [[Utoland]] and is also having a great influence on [[Zircon]], giving them a strong foothold in the [[Jewell Subsector]].

Although both the [[Imperium]] and the [[Zhodani]] Consulate tolerate the Federation, the [[Imperium]] has become increasingly concerned as the Federation seems to be exerting more influence over the neutral worlds in the [[Jewell Subsector]].
