### TUWAYK

Lying just within the area of interest of Trin, Tuwayk is a backwater world of importance mainly for its starport.  One of the standard jump-2 routes into Trin and thereby the Spinward Marches, runs through the port, although it could not really be said to pass through the world itself. The port acts as a local trade hub but Tuwayk does not export much and thus benefits little.

The world itself is very dry and extremely hot, with an indigenous ecosystem hostile to humans and most imported species. Attempts at 'soft terraforming' by way of introducing algae and similar primitive life that –
hopefully – would eventually supplant the local species have been decisively defeated by the resilient and aggressive ecosystem of Tuwayk.

Tuwayk is very much a backwater but within its cities it is a comfortable one. Harsh conditions outside are counterpointed by luxurious, if bland, climate-controlled living areas. There really is no local culture as such; society is very much Imperial-standard and influenced mainly by what is fashionable at Trin.

Trin also exerts considerable political and economic influence over Tuwayk, offering subsidies or reduced prices on necessary goods in return for continued loyalty. Normally few strings are attached but the world government controls the starport and occasionally it is useful to throw a few obstacles in the way of a rival. At these times, quietly having control over port operators can be a useful tool in making a shipping operator or business group's activities in the region a little more costly and frustrating.
