Danease Garber was born on [[Brufort]] to a family who worked in the [[Zuchai Crystals|Zuchai]] mining business for several generations. Her mother ran a small hostel for the occasional visitors to the planet and [[#Danease Garber|Danease]] learned the arts of hospitality under her mother's tutelage. One of the lessons she took to heart was the importance of keeping their world a place of peace and prosperity for those who called it home but her mother also instilled the need to be wary of those who would try to take advantage of the bounty [[Brufort]] had to offer. After her mother died [[#Danease Garber|Danease]] took over the hostel and carried on her mother's work. She was well regarded within [[Brufort#the Neighbourhood|the Neighbourhood]] for her kind demeanour and willingness to support any in need, and her hostel's reputation as a haven earned it the moniker of '[[Brufort#Last Refuge]]'.

Danease offered her services to the first representatives of [[Pernach Solutions]] when they came to [[Brufort]], although she quickly became suspicious of their intentions. She could see them sowing seeds of fear and mistrust and, despite her warnings, there was a growing concern within [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]] that it was only a matter of time before outsiders descended to take over the mines. She felt helpless when [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] was given a contract to provide security for the city and her protests fell on deaf ears as the company took more and more control over the citizens. [[#Danease Garber|Danease]] found a likeminded group of locals who sought a way to open the eyes of [[Brufort]]'s people to the dangers of [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] and she was drawn in when the Aslan [[The Lost Duke#Ktyah]] delivered an impassioned speech about the need to band together against the outsiders and find a way to take [[Brufort]] back for its people. Now she works to gather information on [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] and local sympathetic offworlders who can help in the fight against [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] and [[Alistair Humbolt|the Lost Duke]].
