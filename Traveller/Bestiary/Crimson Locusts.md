While [[Brufort]] is home to many dangerous flora and fauna, the most feared are the deadly swarms of aggressive flying insects known as crimson locusts. Highly aggressive and territorial, these vicious creatures feed on the blood of mammals and fly in dense swarms to attack. While the amount of blood consumed is relatively small, the true danger is a toxin the crimson locusts inject into their victims. Creatures native to [[Brufort]] have developed a natural immunity to this toxin but non-native creatures and sophonts are highly susceptible. While a single crimson locust bite might produce irritation and rash, being swarmed by the creatures can result in anaphylaxis and even death. A sealed vacc or environment suit can keep them out but crimson locusts are small enough to crawl into any breach or external component that might be vital to the continued operation of the suit and they will try to bite through material. There are hundreds of locusts in an individual swarm and anyone caught in their midst will have a hard time doing anything and suffers DM-2 to any checks.

#### Particulate

A Particulate animal is made up of small and more or less independent components; a swarm of bees or ants could be considered to be a single particulate creature. Some highly exotic organisms are made of particles, making them very difficult to kill. Fire-based attacks have full effect; all other weapons do minimum damage.
