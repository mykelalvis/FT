## Okhotnikov

HIS GRACE, THE DUCAL HEIR, ARVINEN ELIOS OKHOTNIKOV
[[Vilani]] Male 32 (87AA9F)

![[Okhotinikov_Portrait.jpg]]
The ducal heir, or ‘your grace’ as the Travellers are permitted to call him, is a competent outdoorsman, although by no means an expert, and an excellent shot.
He is obviously not a person who has ever wanted for anything in his life and he tends to inflict his elevated status upon those around him.
