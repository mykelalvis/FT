## Lift Infantry Regiments and the Imperial Guard

Lift infantry regiments or ‘Huscarles’ are the private armies of the Imperial nobility. The greatest of these armies is the Imperial Guard, composed of 11 regiments of crack troops and other support units.

### Life Infantry Regiments

Largely a conceit of the Civil War era, powerful noble houses established personal bodyguard regiments, some of which were later converted into regular Imperial Army units. Perhaps the most famous of these is the 4518th Imperial Lift Infantry Regiment, the Duke of Regina’s Own Huscarles. This unit was initially assembled for the protection of Baron Caranda of Regina, who modified the force into a fighting unit. The Huscarles were used to quell dissent among the worlds of the Marches after Arbellatra Alkhalikoi ascended to the role of Imperial Regent. They also fought in all subsequent Frontier Wars as contributed formations of the Imperial Army.

In the modern era, many noble houses retain similar units which have varying degrees of utility and battle-readiness. Based on the precedent set by the 4518th, these units are called household troops or simply Huscarles. These private regiments may be established as attached or contributed formations of the Imperial Army but the Emperor has stated his preference that they be of the latter. If the peerage is to keep private military forces, it is best they are seen as team players when it comes to serving the empire. Nevertheless, some nobles maintain regiments as strictly attached formations for various reasons.

It may seem contrary or even seditious to have private military forces in the Imperium but it is allowed for a number of reasons. At their best, lift infantry regiments set the standard for other army units. Because the armies of Imperial worlds are organised independently, standards are virtually impossible to enforce. As the armies of the peerage, Huscarles have access to Imperial technology, which they may train local forces to use. They operate as agents and advocates for the greater Imperial Army, proffering tactical and training standards that might otherwise not exist on worlds that are far from the Core. Their presence is also a not-so-subtle reminder to the citizens of the Imperium that should they fail to comply with Imperial law, the noble bureaucracy can be transformed into a tool of enforcement when called upon to do so.

There are places in the Imperium where the nobility is much more at odds with one another but nobles are strictly forbidden to directly engage each other in private wars with their Huscarles regiments. In contentious sectors like Deneb, opposed noble houses sometimes push the envelope. Most are careful not to directly do battle with each other, but their Huscarles may sometimes be found on the same battlefield in direct opposition to each other with proxy forces formed from local armies and mercenaries doing the actual fighting.

### The Imperial Guard

The greatest of all household troops are the Emperor’s Imperial Guard. Headquartered on Capital, the Imperial Guard are responsible for the defense of the Imperial Palace and its Emperor. The Guard was officially founded by Emperor Cleon I in the year 52 when it consisted of just one regiment, the hallowed Sylean Guard. However, the Guard claims that its history extends back to the Rule of Man, whose Emperor was also defended by a force known as the Imperial Guard.

Imperial Guard forces inhabit a broad, multi-level section near the crown of the spherical palace, where they are trained and housed. The Imperial Guard is designed to reflect the diversity of the Imperium and includes nine lift-infantry regiments (one from each Imperial Domain plus the Aslan and Marine regiments), as well as artillery and cavalry regiments.

•  The Sylean Guard
•  The Vilani Guard
•  The Gateway Guard
•  The Ilelish Guard
•  The Antares Guard
•  The Imperial Artillery
•  The Household Cavalry
•  The Spinward Marches Guard
•  The Marine Guard (also known as the Marine Escort Service)
•  The Aslan Guard
•  The Solomani Guard

Adjuncts to the Guard are the Imperial Marine Escort Force, the Scout Service Protection Detail and the Imperial Navy Escort Squadron. The primary duty of the Marine Escort Force is to serve aboard the Pax Imperii , the 10,000-ton yacht that serves as the flagship of the Emperor’s personal fleet. Members of the Imperial Guard and its supporting forces are bestowed the honor of membership in the Knightly Order of the Emperor’s Guard.

The Imperial Guard are regularly seen by the public when performing the popular changing of the guard ceremony in the parade grounds directly below the [[Grand Imperial Palace of Arbellatra]]. However, they are much more than ceremonial troops. Guard members are hand selected from the ranks of the Imperial Army and Marines for their martial talents and distinguished service. While most serve on [[Capital]], Imperial Guard regiments have been assigned combat roles throughout history and deployed far and wide in service to the Imperium. Some of their more famous actions include an inspiring deployment to fight in the Vargr Campaigns, multiple Frontier War deployments, the fight to the death by the Aslan regiment in defense of Empress Jacqueline against Grand Admiral Olav and the palace coup that led to the ascendance of Emperor Gavin.

### Serving in the Imperial Guard

Travellers serving in Army or Marine careers may attempt to join the Imperial Guard. Most applications to the Guard occur mid-service, after the Traveller has already served one or more terms. Service in the Guard has the following prerequisites:

- Currently serving in the Army or Marines
- STR or END 10+
- Vacc Suit 1 or higher
- Received a promotion in the term just prior to application
- No Mishaps have been incurred during the Traveller’s career

**Qualification:** 11+.
DM+1 if STR 10+. DM+1 if END 10+. DM+1 if SOC 9+.

A Traveller may attempt only one qualification roll for service in the Imperial Guard. Failure indicates that the Traveller was not accepted or washed out during the qualification trials and has been banned from future qualification attempts.

The first term served in the Guard is spent in training. In addition to the skill that is normally received, Travellers obtain one additional skill from the Imperial Guard Service Skills table.

The Traveller may remain in the Imperial Guard if advancement is successful; otherwise, the Traveller leaves the Imperial Guard and may resume their career in the Army or Marines. Exceptions to the rule are the Marine Escort Service and the Aslan Guard. Members of these units may remain in the Guard for the duration of their careers regardless of whether they successfully advance in each term.

Travellers who serve two or more terms in the Imperial Guard receive DM+1 on all non-cash Benefit rolls and may automatically choose TAS Membership as one of their Benefits. In addition, the value of any material Benefit received (e.g., Gun, Blade, Implant) may be up to twice the value listed in the Benefit’s description. The Traveller also receives SOC+2 from having served in the most hallowed and decorated service of the Imperial military forces.
