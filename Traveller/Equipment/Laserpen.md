Built around the standard high-energy laser cartridge, this concealable handgun is used by intelligence operatives in the service of Neubayern. The weapon takes the form of a short rod that resembles nothing more than a bulky pen, complete with pocket clip. It is in no way a 'body pistol' however; the metallic construction and internal electronics will be detected by quite basic instruments, though the device might not be immediately recognised as a weapon.

Triggering the firing stud releases energy from the cartridge, delivering a powerful one-shot laser attack which has a very short range due to the difficulty of collimating a beam in such a small device. The cartridge can be replaced by unscrewing the rear of the weapon but this is not practical in combat. This weapon is not intended for that role; it is a last-ditch means of defence or assassination tool.
