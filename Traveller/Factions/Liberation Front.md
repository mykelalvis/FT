The Liberation Front are part of the growing separatist movement. They have around 20 cells operating on six different worlds. Liberation Front are fighting for the right to be independent from the [[Imperium]] and other political powers. For the most part, the groupâ€™s motives are peaceful but they do not shy away from sabotage. They only use violence when necessary and always avoid civilian casualties.

The Liberation Front has a growing support on many worlds. The group has been known to carry out acts of terrorism against Imperial targets so for this reason the members keep their identities secret but they are adept at motivating and manipulating local citizens to speak out on their behalf.

A number of [[Zhodani]] agents have infiltrated the Front (as well as other groups) and are encouraging dissent in the [[Imperium]]. The more internal problems the [[Imperium]] has to deal with, the less they see the problems outside.

Primarily in the [[Jewell Subsector]]
