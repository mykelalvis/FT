## CAREY
A small, wet world, Carey's ecosystem is dominated by a vast array of fungal species. Some are very large, growing into weird shapes and play a similar role to trees in other ecosystems. Native life is not particularly sophisticated, although there are some species of large flying insects and centipede-like creatures living among the larger fungi. Offworld species, including humans, find the spore-laden atmosphere of Cary intolerable and anyone venturing outside the carefully sealed downport buildings must undergo thorough decontamination upon their return. The risk of contaminating other worlds with Carey's rampant fungal growth is such that the Scout Service is considering imposing travel restrictions or even a full interdiction.
