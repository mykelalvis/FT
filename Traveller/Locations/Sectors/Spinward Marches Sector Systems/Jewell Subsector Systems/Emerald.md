Emerald Emerald 0206 B766555–B S 0206 B766555–B S I Ag Ga NI GI Ag Ga NI G Emerald forms part of the Jewell Cluster. The fertile lands produce abundant crops much of which is shipped to Jewell to support the population there. Emerald is vital to the success of lanthanum on Jewell and is also an important trade hub in its own right. Full details can be found on page 55 (Keystone).

There are four gas giants in the Emerald system and two planetoid belts. The inner and outer orbits are occupied by Emerald and an uninhabited planet respectively.

Emerald 0206 B766555–B S I Ag Ga NI G Emerald is a magnificent world of verdant lands and green tinted oceans. It was colonized in 308 by the Ecannis family. The isolationist attitude of the family restricted the colony's growth as offworlders were restricted to the starport and colonists were denied permission to settle here.

At the start of the First Frontier War in 589, the [[Imperium]] declared martial law on Emerald and many of the Ecannis nobles, suspected of being [[Zhodani]] sympathisers, were incarcerated on Jewell. Emerald fell to the [[Zhodani]] in 592 around the time that the [[Imperium]] lost control of Jewell. When Jewell was recaptured in 603, the [[Zhodani]] evacuated Emerald and the Ecannis family were allowed to return in 606.

In later years, the restrictions on offworlders became harder to enforce and new settlements were being founded around the planet. Turning this to their advantage, the Ecannis family used the new workforce to increase their agricultural exports. The fertile lands produced abundant crops and by 900 Emerald was a major grain supplier to Jewell.

Emerald fell to the [[Zhodani]] once more during the Third Frontier War, to be retaken several years later in 982. Once Emerald was back under Imperial control and reinforced with military bases and a naval fleet, there was in influx of refugees and the population grew rapidly. Since many refugees were from worlds that were ceded to the [[Zhodani]] after the war, they had little choice but to remain and build a home on Emerald.

Emerald has remained an Imperial controlled world but it is still ruled by the Ecannis family who have segregated into smaller families, each in charge of different industries and services. Marriage into

one of these families is much sought after and it is not uncommon for people to be adopted into the m.

# ATTITUDES

Although there is a distinct social segregation between the Ecannis nobles and the working class, there is never a shortage of jobs and only a few unskilled workers are dissatisfied with their standard of life. The working class are polite but the nobles tend to be unfriendly to offworlders.

# LAWS

All travellers are permitted to land on Emerald. Personal weapons are permitted but all other weapons are illegal. Contraband includes all computers, software and similar technology.

# PLACES OF INTEREST

## Eritrea

The capital city is the largest settlement on Emerald and home to the ruling family. The noble district is situated on the eastern edge of the city with many of the estates walled inside private compounds.

## Starport

The starport is located 50km southeast of Eritrea and a variety of transportation is provided to the capital and other nearby settlements.

## Agrellia

This remote settlement is located roughly 100km north of the starport. Although it is home to a small number of scientists, Agrellia is essentially a large research facility and nature reserve. Most of the research is focussed on studying the indigenous creatures in their natural habitats but it also sponsors research in other fields.

This region is also known for its high levels of electromagnetic energy that has been known to cause problems with advanced technology. This is the reason that the facility (which is shielded) was built here so that they could study the phenomenon.
