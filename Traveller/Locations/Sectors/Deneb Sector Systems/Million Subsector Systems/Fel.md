### FEL

Fel lies just outside the Imperial border, within the territory claimed by the United Followers of Augurgh. It is unusually steadfast in its support of the UFA which, combined with its importance as a source of industrial goods, makes it an extremely significant asset to the alliance. Fel maintains a small but effective system defence flotilla, backed up by a standing deployment of the UFA Navy. The infighting among captains and senior commanders within the fleet elements deployed to Fel rarely spills over into local politics but all the same Fel's government has openly stated that it would prefer the fleet to go and bicker somewhere else.

This is unlikely to happen, since the UFA feels the need to demonstrate its naval capabilities and Fel is a good place to be seen. Its high-standard port sees considerable trade from Imperial worlds as well as local systems, and several Imperial corporations are active on Fel or at its port. The UFA leadership considers that reminding the [[Imperium]] and surrounding worlds that they have a navy – of sorts –
is necessary and will sometimes concentrate almost the entire available force off Fel just to make a point.

Fel itself is not a welcoming world. It has an unbreathable exotic atmosphere and its ecosystem is saturated with heavy metals and other toxic minerals.
This makes food production a problem – Fel relies heavily on imports – but it does support an extensive mining and mineral-extraction sector. This in turn feeds the world's industry, which produces goods for export across the subsector and the territory of the UFA.

Fel also builds starships, mostly commercial ships or freighters, but Fel is a primary shipyard for the UFA and produces a range of vessels ranging from fighters through escorts to the occasional cruiser. Some vessels go to less than reputable operators and whilst Fel does not openly build corsairs for pirate bands some of its 'well-armed merchant ship' designs are distinctly paramilitary. Fel has been known to issue Letters of Marque to the operators of these vessels although it normally distances itself from activities of corsair bands in order to maintain the façade of a civilised power. This is important if the world wishes to avoid a raid in force by the Imperial Navy.

Fel's cities are mainly underground and tend to be focussed on an industrial or mining center with supporting infrastructure. Some structures protrude above ground level and are either pressurised or protected by a dome, however the majority are fully underground. Living quarters would be considered claustrophobic by most humans but public spaces like parks are large and well-kept.

The Khoeurrroe-class Armed Merchant Vessel is constructed at TL10 and designed to be capable of two successive jumps, with enough in-system thrust to ensure timely cargo delivery and armament to deter interference. It is the ideal vessel for secure freight delivery or service as a naval auxiliary. At least, so says its official design registry.

The Khoeurrroe-class is heavily armed for a merchant ship and has sufficient acceleration to chase down most commercial vessels. Its heavy torpedo armament is inefficient when attacking a small vessel but often a single torpedo fired as a warning will ensure compliance with the Khoeurrroe captain's requests. Several features are described with polite euphemisms; the heavy-duty cargo crane and forced linkage apparatus are 'attractive to the salvage and rescue market' whilst the armories and brig are 'secure transportation for passengers and high-value cargo'.

In reality, this vessel is only viable as a corsair or in a subsidized role such as providing escort to other merchants – the other side of the corsair coin. Its cargo capacity is inadequate for standard freighting and even if the crew take double-occupancy, the passenger accommodation is very small – unless of course the brig is actually used to transport people.

On-planet food production is industrial and mostly based on yeast products. These are palatable enough but not satisfying for the soul and many of the world's Vargr population spend a significant part of their income on imported food. One useful, if perhaps odd, distraction from the local food is hunting. Indoor game preserves do exist, although membership and licenses are very expensive. For most Vargr so inclined, the cheaper option of outdoor hunting offers at least the feeling of having chased real food. The local wildlife is so full of toxic chemicals that it is inedible but tucking into a plate of yeast-extract and noodles is somehow more satisfying after a successful hunt.

The world government is surprisingly stable, considering it is made up of a great many Vargr clans. As might be expected, personalities play a big part in governance and affairs of the planetary senate can be violent. Even when there is no outright conflict there is always a lot of noise and posturing in the senate, with threats and denunciations commonplace. Consensus is usually achieved and the end result is a stable society but the methods by which this is achieved can be vigorous.

GABRAEL Located close to Taproban in the central cluster of Million, Gabrael is to a great extent a typical Imperial world. About 1.2 million of its four million citizens are Vargr but all are Imperial citizens first and foremost. The world is rather dry and has a tainted atmosphere, which prevented it from ever being an attractive destination for settlement. In fact, the orbital starport is the world's main source of revenue and far more important than the planet itself.

The highport is owned and operated by Ling-Standard Products (LSP), which runs the facility as a wholly owned subsidiary and rents space to other businesses.
The port has a repair-and-maintenance contract with the subsector fleet, although this is mostly restricted to minor repairs on small escort vessels. The shipyards mainly produce small merchant and commercial vessels of a sort used by many clients throughout the subsector.
These are often armed for self-defence, given the world's location close to the border and many clients ask for their ships to be upgunned as tensions rise.

The highport generates a great deal of revenue from trade and shipbuilding but only a small proportion reaches the planetary government. Some of this is taxation and although LSP pays only a very small percentage to its hosting government, this still forms most of the income of a world with a population of four million. Some purchases are also made, notably foodstuffs from the belt of industrial farms around the downport.

Visitors could be forgiven for thinking that Gabrael has pretensions of being an agricultural world but only a small area is intensively farmed. This provides more than enough food for the population and sale to the highport operators.
Most craft based at the downport are agricultural haulage shuttles, with few passenger and cargo vessels.

The downport has minimal facilities, serving mainly as a transfer port for agricultural goods. The world's startown is located around 20km away, outside the immediate farming belt. It is reached by a fast and efficient rail service and caters to offworld visitors as well as acting as the center of government. Around 500,000 people dwell in the startown or immediately around it, with the remainder of the population living in small cities wherever there are resources and sufficient water.

IKHABA Located right on the Imperial border with the United Followers of Augurgh, Ikhaba is a world of little importance except as a buffer against UFA influence.
The 900,000 or so inhabitants have a mature TL8 society that cannot compete economically with nearby high-tech industrial worlds. Considerable amounts of food are shipped across the border to Fel in return for industrial goods, with Ikhaba very much the junior partner in the relationship.

This situation has been used as a rallying cry by various factions. Investment (by whatever faction is being denounced for not doing it) in worlds like Ikhaba would prevent Imperial systems becoming poor relations to powerful foreigners or so say those who do not have to fund it. At present, there are no practical reasons for sinking vast sums into backwater worlds in order to bring them up to high-tech standards and Imperial pride does not translate into freighters full of cash. Thus Ikhaba and worlds like it continue to get by without any real chance of development.

Ikhaba has a corporate government; in this case literally. The World Corporation of Ikhaba was founded specifically to oversee colonization of the planet and has governed it ever since. Whilst not a charismatic or inspiring organization, the worldcorp does an effective job of enforcing liberal laws and keeping the street lights on and the population are content due, perversely perhaps, to agitation by proponents of the UFA.
Whilst the UFA has won over a small segment of the population, the majority have gone the other way. There is a greater sense of national identity on Ikhaba now than has existed in the past.

Some of the more radical factions within the UFA have tried to sway opinion on Ikhaba by direct means but violence, intimidation and attacks on shipping have resulted in a further hardening of opinion against the alliance. Ikhaba's liberal weapon ownership laws have permitted the formation of highly unofficial militias, which occasionally clash with UFA-sponsored groups.
The subsector fleet has also stepped up patrols in the system to deter attacks on shipping.

TALON Talon is located a couple of parsecs from the Imperial border and forms part of the United Followers of Augurgh. Like the alliance itself, Talon is anything but united. Its states merge and split, with factions sometimes forming a quasi-state that somehow manages to exist alongside the local government for a time. The population consists of around 200 million Vargr and 1.8 billion Souggvuez, the native people of Talon. The two species are intermixed and have formed a united culture.

The first Vargr came to Talon around -300, fleeing disaster in their homelands. Theirs was a large-
scale migration but not an invasion as such. Instead,
the spacefaring Vargr found kindred spirits in the Souggvuez, who at the time had an atomic-era culture.
The Vargr were more energetic – some might say pushy – than the indigenous population and made themselves a niche in the upper echelons of society.
These distinctions gradually eroded over time and today there really is little distinction between a Vargr and a Souggvuez citizen of Talon.

Talon has a sufficiently large economy that it exerts influence on both sides of the border and routinely hosts Imperial trade ships up from Taproban and even Atsah.
Its ambassadors are major players in the politics of the local worlds, although their efforts to show the Imperials just how important they are tend to come off as noisy posturing for its own sake.

One characteristic of Talon's complex government system is that everything is done by committee, including interstellar affairs. When disagreements reach an impasse, the usual result is some variation on the theme of conflict. Skirmishing and corsair raids are more common than all-out war but it does happen from time-
to-time. The frequency of these breakdowns is such that Talon is locked in a cycle of growth and destruction.
