# Mushenku

![[CA2-50_1476396001.jpg]]

Another common species the Travellers see is the mushenku, roughly translated from the Vilani as ‘bird fish’. These creatures have dual gill-lung respiratory systems, enabling them to be equally comfortable swimming in the shallows or flying 20–100 meters above the water. Their bat-like wings enable them to stay aloft on [[Affinity]]’s dense atmosphere for hours at a time. Biologists have observed flocks – or khaalap, as they are called in Vilani – of mushenku following the exact lines of ocean currents, many of which end in gyres where nutrients gather.
