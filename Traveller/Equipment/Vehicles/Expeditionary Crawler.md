This hardy tracked vehicle is custom designed to travel on worlds like Indshiim Ganme. Its treads are spiked in order to grip the ground and when stopped, it bores into the ground with an array of anchors to prevent it from being thrown about by high winds. The crawler is armored and structurally reinforced to protect it from windborne projectiles. Accommodations are cramped but there is enough room for the crew to move around. Bunks, a fresher and a mini-galley are installed for extended expeditions. The crawler is segmented into three small compartments that enable it to navigate crevasses and deep inclines. The rear compartment is designed to hang at an angle of up to 90o in order to deposit its mini-submarine into the ocean over the edge of an escarpment or other angled surface.
