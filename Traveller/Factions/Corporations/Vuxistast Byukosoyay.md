# Vuxistast Byukosoyay

The borderline-unpronounceable name of this Droyne group has defied translation from the original Oynprith, with scholars suggesting meanings ranging from ‘Favourable Association’ to ‘Trojan Reaches Insignificant Event’. The group – it is not clear if it is a business in the normal human sense – is typically referred to as V-B or ‘Veeb’ by most humans.

The assets associated with Veeb include a number of small starships and enclaves on at least three non- Droyne worlds. The latter occupy part of the Starport but might as well be on another planet as far as human interactions go. Their leaders have dealings with the port authorities, world government and port users when it suits them, which means intermittently and with no discernable pattern. These dealings are typically commercial but occasionally stray into diplomatic territory as the Droyne suddenly request, demand or say they have been granted certain concessions. Like most interactions with Droyne, these dealings tend to be baffling and a bit alarming to humans.

Most of what is known about Veeb is based upon observations; the Droyne do not discuss their operations or way of thinking with outsiders, at least not in a comprehensible manner. It has been observed that Droyne facilities and vessels affiliated with Veeb use the same symbol; a sort of distorted disc with various different projections that presumably denote... something or other.

Virtually all observed assets of Veeb are constructed at TL14, and are aesthetically similar in many ways. The portside enclaves number a few hundred Droyne of the usual caste mix, and seem to have a little manufacturing capability. Certainly they do not import enough of anything to supply their estimated needs, and Droyne ships do not visit the enclaves often enough to resupply them. The ships themselves range from 200 to 800 tons; most seem to be cargo or transport vessels though it is possible that the smaller ones act only as personnel transportation.

The Veeb’s emissaries will ignore outside contact for weeks or months, then pick up discussions as if no break had occurred – or start a new one in apparent ignorance of anything that has previously been agreed. Despite this maddening tendency, there are still many who want to do business with the Droyne. In some cases, this is for a secondary purpose, such as learning more about them in the process of commercial activity, but many simply see the Droyne as another market. Their occasional tendency to vastly overpay for something quite mundane offsets the intense frustration of trying to interact with a species so very alien... at least to some extent.

Veeb ships do not carry commercial cargo, nor do they take non-Droyne passengers aboard. However, their leaders will sometimes charter a non-Droyne crewed vessel to carry items, or to accompany a Droyne ship on some mission. This usually turns out to be something startlingly mundane, but occasionally the chartered crew will find themselves trying to follow confusing and perhaps conflicting directives with no clear indication of what their patrons want from them.

Veeb is definitely doing something, and they will occasionally pay non-Droyne to take part in it. Beyond that their activities are shrouded in mystery.
