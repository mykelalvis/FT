### KIIRINDOR

Kiirindor is notable primarily as an x-boat station and naval base and provides an essential link for jump-4 traffic headed for Usani. Less capable ships have to make a long transit through Dunmag, adding weeks or even months to the trip. The world itself is unremarkable except for its unusual government.

Kiirindor is governed from Maelstrom, site of Imperial Research Station Gamma. This was originally an emergency measure imposed when local governance collapsed several decades ago but has since become the norm. Delegations of administrators and directors are sent to Kiirindor to provide leadership to a populace who have become so used to the arrangement that a proposal to return to self-governance was rejected by the vast majority of citizens.

It has been claimed that the administration of Kiirindor is overseen by the research station on Maelstrom but this is simply not true. The story has its origin in a vid drama of a few years back and has no basis in reality.  Kiirindor is governed by feudal technocrats from Maelstrom, not mad scientists from Research Station Gamma.
