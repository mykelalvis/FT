# INTRODUCTION

Economics is one of the fundamental driving forces in any society, and Charted Space is full of groups trying to make a living – or better, a big profit. Companies and Corporations presents some of these groups along with their agenda, their methods and any dark secrets they may have. These commercial bodies are much smaller than the great Megacorporations, but some of them are major players in their own field. They might be encountered as patrons, allies, opponents or victims of the Travellers’ schemes, adding depth and colour to that generic row of starport cargo brokers and putting a backstory to that pile of freight containers.

The companies and corporations in this book can be used in a variety of ways. They can be used as a quick means of filling in some detail when the Travellers decide to go off script, or can become a regular part of the game as opponents, allies, patrons or simply part of the scenery. Little details like a company logo on a shipping container can bring a game to life, and can be worked into the plot of a game to show that something is not right.

If the Travellers find the logo of company that only deals in electronics and cybernetics on a container of guns, they will suspect something is amiss. The referee could just tell them they know this company does not sell guns, but it may be better to let the Travellers realise for themselves. If they have dealt with this company before, even just as a passing incidental detail a couple of starports ago, the mystery will come to life in a subtler way.

In short, this book contains a number of commercial entities which can be used by the referee as part of the backdrop or a key part of an adventure. Since the Travellers keep encountering detailed companies, they will not be able to guess which one is important to the plot and which are essentially red herrings.

# COMMERCIAL & SHIPPING

Interstellar commerce is big business. It is also quite small business, and every size of business in between. Commercial and shipping firms range from a loose alliance of starport brokers to major shipping lines operating numerous merchant vessels. Technically, a Free Trader is a single-vessel ‘shipping line’ and many style themselves as such, but this is seen as highly pretentious by the more important players in this sector. Most savvy Travellers can tell the difference between a Free Trader captain trying to sound more legitimate and an actual multi-ship concern, but in truth there are more than a few single-ship ‘lines’ that are worthy of the title due to their professionalism and excellent service. There are also a number of outright crooks who hide behind a shiny corporate façade.

# INDUSTRIAL & MANUFACTURING

Travellers use all manner of equipment, usually without pondering where it came from. In the immediate sense that rarely matters unless the item is defective, but the process of putting a tool in a spacefarer’s hand or a spare part in a locker is a long and complex one. From raw materials and energy generation through design and development to the manufacturing process, every item out in space is at the end of a chain of near- miracles made possible by technology and ingenuity. The existence of something as mundane as a spanner or a hand-held diagnostics unit implies a multi-million- credit industry at the very least, and a chain of supply and procurement stretching back several parsecs. All this industry forms part of the backdrop against which Travellers have their adventures. Occasionally that backdrop leaps into sharp relief.

moon. These towns usually include a fair number of dependents as well as people employed in peripheral industries such as maintenance, fabrication and recreation. Not all of these are employed by Outsystem; many are independents or subcontractors who support the extraction and ore-processing marketplace.

Asteroid mining is normally carried out by jump-capable mobile platforms which carry a flotilla of cutters or shuttles. Mining platforms are usually supported by one or more transport ships, which are often independent merchant ships on a short or medium-term contract. Outsystem is well respected in the Free Trader community as a fair client who pays on time; an ore- hauling contract is not the most exciting of jobs but it provides a steady stream of modest income plus a reference that can be useful when working with other corporate clients.

Outsystem also works with independent belters and their communities. Far from oppressing them or stealing their claims as the vids suggest, Outsystem Minerals has discovered that paying a fair price for the rights to work a claim creates goodwill and makes belter groups more inclined to bring their claims to the firm rather than registering them and undertaking small-scale extraction as and when they can. This partnership between a mid- sized mining firm and freelance traders, prospectors and surveyors runs contrary to the stereotype but it generally works well.

Outsystem will often deploy a small ‘proving’ vessel to a new claim and begin small-scale extraction and sampling. If the claim proves worth exploiting, one of its larger mining platforms will be jumped in. These are not huge, but can produce a significant volume of ore on a regular basis and process it down into ingots for transportation. The presence of such a vessel in a given system can be very good for the local economy. Stores and supplies are typically bought from the mainworld, and trade ships are often attracted as a result. Ore may be supplied to local industry at a discount, since it is cheaper to haul it across a star system than to jump it to another.

If a ship mining ship is deployed for a long period, or an outpost is set up, the local world typically sees more ships through its port, an expansion of its planetside industry and some additional starport revenue as outsystem crews take some R&R time. When the ship leaves, these benefits are lost. This means little to a

# OTHER FIRMS

Some business organisations are highly diversified or difficult to categorise. Usually there is some internal logic to which pies they have their fingers in – often a firm’s history will give a clue to why its interests are very diverse. However, some organisations are very difficult to figure out. This may be the result of deliberate obfuscation but can often simply be due to a lack of information. Commercial entities are rarely generous with their information, forcing outsiders to take a best guess based upon observations that can be misleading. Some firms likely show their strengths; others prefer to conceal or confuse them. Others are based on an alien way of thinking and can be difficult to fathom from a human perspective.
