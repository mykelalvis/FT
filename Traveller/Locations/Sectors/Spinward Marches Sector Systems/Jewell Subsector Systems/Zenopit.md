[[Zenopit]] [[Zenopit]] 0210 D130546–7 0210 D130546–7 Po NI GPo NI G [[Zenopit]] is a small planet on the rimward edge of the subsector. What used to be a thriving mining colony has been reduced to only two mining facilities that trade with neighboring systems for food and other essential supplies. Full details can be found on page 42 (Conspiracies).

Two gas giants occupy the inner obits of this system with four planets in the outer orbits. Aqua is the fourth planet from the sun and Zenopit is the sixth.

Zenopit 0210 D130546–7 Po NI G Zenopit is a small planet on the rimward edge of the subsector. This desert world was never considered for colonization until a group of prospectors found traces of lanthanum. Further investigation revealed several rich deposits and in 782 the planet was colonized.

Like many other worlds, Zenopit thrived for many years until the [[lanthanum]] deposits ran dry and the economy collapsed, unable to support itself. This lead to a mass exodus in 893 where most people with the means to leave Zenopit did so while the opportunity was there. Those who were unable or unwilling to leave combined their resources and continued to mine the few remaining mineral deposits.

The population of 180,000 are spread out over three settlements, two of which are located close to mining facilities and the third operates the only working ore processing plant. The refined ore is then traded with neighboring systems for food and other essential supplies.

Until recently, Zenopit had regular trade routes with the Federation of Arden who began to show an interest in investing on Zenopit. However, with the sudden occupation of Utoland, the Zenopians pulled out from the negotiations. The Federation of Arden responded with a trade embargo, stating that it would only be lifted if Zenopit agreed to join the federation. This has made things difficult for the Zenopians but they still enjoy good trade relations with other nearby worlds.

# ATTITUDES

The inhabitants of Zenopit are a proud people. They work hard to survive and through the greatest adversary, their colony still struggles on. Many Zenopians are not afraid to speak their mind and more than anything else, they value their freedom and independence.

It is also important to note that the Zenopians' belief in independence is not an isolationist or xenophobic reaction but a resistance to being subjugated or dictated to. Relationships with other worlds are important to the Zenopians and they fully understand that trade is essential to the survival of many colonies, including their own.

The [[Imperium]] is not held in high esteem on Zenopit, for not only has the [[Imperium]] ignored requests for aid but some Zenopians blame the [[Imperium]] for strip-mining their world due to the demand for [[lanthanum]] at the time.

This anti-Imperial sentiment has been growing on Zenopit for some time and ultimately led to the formation of the Liberation Front. With the recent events concerning the Federation of Arden, life has become difficult on Zenopit but it has only strengthened the resolve of the people here. Although many Zenopians empathise with the Liberation Front, there are those who feel that the group has gone too far and their actions will ultimately harm the people of Zenopit.

# LAWS

Anyone is permitted to land on Zenopit. All weapons, except for shotguns, stunners and melee weapons are illegal. Most drugs are also considered contraband, except medicinal drugs and non- addictive narcotics.

# PLACES OF INTEREST

## Xenoport

Situated close to the starport, Xenoport has become the trade hub of Zenopit. Many consider it to be the capital but there is no official status in this regard. The southern region of the city is dominated by the ore processing plant. [[lanthanum]] ore is shipped here from Orelia and Lacuna. Once processed, the ore is ready to be exported by Xenoport's small fleet of ships and other merchants.

## Orelia

Orelia is located near the largest mine on Zenopit and produces nearly three quarters of the [[lanthanum]] exports. The city is a vast underground network of tunnels and caverns but since the exodus, only half of the city is used. The rest has fallen into disrepair and several tunnels have already collapsed.

## Lacuna

Lacuna is the smallest and newest settlement on Zenopit. The dome was taken from an abandoned settlement to be rebuilt near a refurbished mining facility. However, part of the dome was damaged in transit so nearly a quarter of it has been sectioned off and is uninhabitable.
