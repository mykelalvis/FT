### Gl'lu

The Gl'lu are native to [[Kubishush]] (0917), a forbidding world with a high-pressure corrosive atmosphere.  Kubishush is wracked by earthquakes, making survival a challenge. Despite this, the Gl'lu had developed a technological civilization by the time they were contacted by the [[Imperium]].

Gl'lu are septapods, with a slimy appearance most humans find highly unpleasant. Four of their six limbs can be used for movement or manipulation of objects - or a thoroughly disgusting combination of both – whilst their eyestalk is in constant motion. Gl'lu are hermaphroditic and need an ammonia-rich environment to survive. This makes direct contact with humans rare.

Despite their very alien appearance, the Gl'lu are friendly and welcoming, with a culture familiar to Imperial citizens in many ways. Their art and music are agreeable to human perceptions, while their languages are not difficult to learn and adaptable to the human voice and ear. Technology is locally manufactured but relies heavily on Imperial standards and produces finished goods for the Imperial market through General Products, Ling-Standard Products and Instellarms.

[[Kubishush]] has a multitude of subcultures, each with its own language. Government is decentralised, with city-states governing provinces and smaller cities managing regions within a province. This can lead to issues with variations in local customs, language and laws, but native Gl'lu are employed by both the Traveller's Aid Society and IISS as translators and guides for visitors.

#### Creating Gl'lu Travellers

The Gl'lu are descended from rough-terrain scavenger intimidators and look like nightmarish insectoids. Their porous mottled skin, slimy appendages and periscope-like eyestalk make them look like a cross between a [[Terra|Terran]] octopus and a slug. Indeed, upon first encountering the race during the Grand Survey, scouts mistook them for a far-flung colony of Githiasko or genetically altered hivers. Their body is asymmetric, with two sets of limbs; the front set comprises four legs, which have adapted hands, while the rear set consists of three stouter legs for stability and power. The Gl'lu have a single gender and for all intents and purposes are hermaphroditic.

#### Characteristics

Gl'lu Travellers have the following modifiers applied to their characteristics: END-1, DEX+1, EDU-2

#### Traits

Gl'lu Travellers all possess the following traits:
**Atmospheric Requirements:** The Gl'lu depend on an ammonia-rich environment and require a sealed suit to survive in other atmospheres.

**Fast Metabolism (+1):** Gl'lu have a heightened metabolism and very fast reactions. They gain DM+1 to initiative rolls.

**Heightened Senses:** Gl'lu have better hearing and sense of smell than humans. They receive DM+1 to any Recon and Survival checks they have to make.

**IR Vision:** Gl'lu have highly developed vision in the infrared part of the spectrum and can see clearly in darkness. However, they can only see in infrared.

**Natural Weapon (fangs, 1D+2):** Gl'lu have sharp fangs that they can use to bite enemies. The fangs do 1D+2 damage and use the Melee
(natural) skill.

#### Careers

All careers from the _Traveller Core Rulebook_ are suitable for the Gl'lu.

Gl'lu Starships The Gl'lu have become a minor starfaring race and thousands of Gl'lu traders can be found throughout the region. Their best-selling commodities include high-
grade materials and innovative environmental products, while the synthetic slime coating that grants the wearer protection from airborne corrosives is less than attractive to other races.

Gl'lu starship design is a focus of obsession with backup systems and redundancy, and all Gl'lu starships have two bridges and two maneuver drives, typically situated as far apart as possible. To a human, this wasted space seems inefficient and in cases of multiple backups even ludicrous, but to a Gl'lu humans live on borrowed time onboard ships with no real redundancy of critical systems.

The Gl'lu are accustomed to inhabiting small spaces and their staterooms require much less space than those intended for humans. They do not suffer any penalties for working within a small bridge (see page 17 of High Guard ) and a Gl'lu stateroom can comfortably support eight Gl'lu rather than two humans.

GL'LU TRADER

This trader is typical of Gl'lu design and many like it can be found in the Sabine and Inar subsectors. Noticeably larger than a free trader, its size is necessary to compete with comparative merchants from the [[Imperium]], due to the notorious design features of the Gl'lu. While cramped inside, the trader is supremely reliable and a well-maintained vessel can keep on plying trade routes for decades at a time.

Kirissukyoya The Kirissukyoya are native to Giikusu (2316), although they can be encountered almost anywhere in the sector aboard their own ships or travelling on those of other races. They evolved as hunters in the extensive forests of their world, where their six-limbed bodies adapted to movement among the undergrowth or along branches.

The Kirissukyoya developed a technological society despite a series of highly destructive wars, then plunged themselves into barbarism in a global conflict around
-2000. They might have become extinct but for the intervention of Droyne from Zeen, who helped some enclaves stabilize and eventually begin to rebuild the technological base. This process was accelerated after the Kirissukyoya became Imperial citizens and today they have a spacefaring civilization.

Much of Giikusu was reclaimed by forest after the fall of civilization and although cities are now being built in these areas the Kirissukyoya are respectful of their ancient woodlands. Possibly as a result, they are not welcoming of visitors to their homeworld although are friendly and sociable when encountered on their travels. Giikusu has only the most basic starport available to outsiders, although most major cities have a port for local traffic that is of much better quality. Special licences are required to use these ports and are not granted lightly.

Lurent The Lurent are a minor race native to Borlund in the Lamas subsector. They are large creatures, taking up as much space as six humans, with a headless torso in two segments. The thorax contains sense organs and has two tentacle-like appendages used for manipulation.
The abdomen has a pair of legs used for locomotion and a vestigial tail, and the entire body is covered in fur, usually in shades of pale blue or green.

The Lurent seem to go through cycles where they are compelled to wander far from their homes, eventually returning to become sedentary. Cycles vary in length; an individual might wander for months or decades and will not always settle for an equal period before setting out again. Lurent are tied to their place of origin somehow, and can become distressed if unable to return. The homeward urge is as powerful as the desire to leave and has defied clear scientific explanation.

Creating Kirissukyoya Travellers The Kirissukyoya have trilateral symmetry, with three arms and three legs. While Kirissukyoya have a recognizable head, their brains are located within their torsos.

Characteristics Kirissukyoya Travellers have the following modifiers applied to their characteristics: STR-1

Traits Kirissukyoya Travellers all possess the following traits:
Eidetic Sense (hearing): Kirissukyoya are able to recall anything they hear with perfect clarity.

Natural Weapon (claws, 1D): Kirissukyoya have retractable claws that they can use to eviscerate enemies. The claws do 1D damage and use the Melee (natural) skill.

Skill (mechanic 1): Kirissukyoya have an innate understanding of mechanical processes and all possess the skill Mechanic 1.

Careers All careers from the Traveller Core Rulebook are suitable for the Kirissukyoya.

Creating Lurent Travellers Lurent are very large by human standards. They have no vocal cords and communicate by a mix of tentacle gesture and body language. Their language is very subtle, with complex nuances of gesture

that humans simply cannot replicate. Lurent can hear perfectly well but sometimes forget to listen to words instead of following gestures. This can lead to embarrassing misunderstandings or occasional violence.

Characteristics Lurent Travellers roll 2D+4 when generating their STR and END.

Traits Lurent Travellers all possess the following traits:
Natural Weapon (Tentacle Bash, 2D): Lurent are big and powerful enough to be able to smash many opponents without needing to pick up a weapon.
Their tentacles do 2D damage and use the Melee
(natural) skill.

Wanderlust: Lurent who are in a 'wandering cycle'
cannot remain in one place for long. They will constantly agitate to be moving on and become increasingly irritable if they cannot. Those in a 'homeward' cycle will do the same but are compelled to make progress in the direction of Borlund. A Lurent in a 'sedentary' cycle will want to stay where he is and not be receptive to suggestions of further travel.

Careers The following careers from the Traveller Core Rulebook are all suitable for the Lurent: Drifter, Merchant, Noble, Rogue, Scout and Scholar.
