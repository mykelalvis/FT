### Souggvuez

The indigenous people of [[Talon]] generally use the [[Vargr]] name for themselves – Souggvuez – rather than their own self-name, ever since the two societies became intermingled. The Souggvuez are slightly larger than humans but more slightly built, with an asymmetrical three-section torso. The 'walking' section has three strong 'walking legs', with five 'balancing legs' in front of this. Their four arms end in dual-thumbed hands.

The complex system of gender-castes of the Souggvuez includes an egg-carrier/guardian of the young known as Hatchers, which require genetic material from two other castes to fertilise a clutch of eggs. Normally 2-6 young are produced by a Hatcher, with gender-caste varying across a clutch.

There are four other gender-castes, known to outsiders as Designers, Explorers, Hunters and Workers. The latter tend to be more solidly built than other gender-castes but there are few other outward indications.

The Souggvuez are 'doers' rather than 'thinkers' and this is reflected in both their learning abilities and society. They pick up new skills quickly but are poor at retaining complex details and leadership is based more upon status than qualifications. The latter made them compatible with the Vargr, who readily slotted into leadership roles within Souggvuez society.

As a result, traditional Souggvuez society has been eroded and replaced with a Vargr-style system of clans based upon loyalty to charismatic individuals of both species. Most Souggvuez seem unaware that anything has changed and have little attachment to their old way of life. The efforts of Imperial scientists to study and preserve the traditional art and culture of the Souggvuez generally meet with bafflement; things are how they are and if the old ways were good enough to care about they would not have been forgotten.

The Souggvuez have poor vision and no sense of smell; however they do have an innate ability to detect electrical fields. This can best be described as a form of 'remote touch' and is not very precise, but can allow a Souggvuez to find concealed cables or avoid an electric shock. Their bodies are covered in fine scales that convey a little protection.
