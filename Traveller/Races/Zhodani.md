Source not known.  Possibly [[Behind the Claw]]?

Information about the Zhodani is hard to come by and not always reliable, but it seems they arrived on their homeworld ([[Zhdant]]) about 300,000 years ago. They were brought from [[Terra]] by the [[Ancients]], who settled them and undertook a range of incomprehensible acts including remodelling mountains and cutting, then refilling, ocean trenches. They also reportedly built a city on the moon of [[Zhdant]].

Soon afterwards, perhaps as little as a few hundred years, [[Zhdant]] came under severe orbital bombardment. It is thought that the Ancient cities and other sites were destroyed using several hundred megatons of nuclear explosives, as well as deadfall ordnance (objects dropped from orbit as kinetic weapons) and other unidentified weapons. Modern [[Zhodani]] are descended from a few tens of thousands of survivors, who were cast back to barbarism. There are no records of survivors among the Ancients.

They are currently governed as/by the [[Zhodani Consulate]].

# THE ZHODANI

The Six Major Races are considered to be the Aslan, Droyne, Hivers, K'kree, Vargr and Humaniti (merging the Vilani, Solomani and Zhodani branches of the human race into one). However, the Solomani and Vilani branches would prefer to forget their Zhodani brethren exist, as they have built their empire upon the science of the mind. In a universe where science has finally given all the ability to seek their maximum potential – to know what pursuit can allow a person to unlock all he can be

- the Vilani and Solomani would prefer to not know.

The Zhodani found themselves on a world they did not come from and experienced repeated disasters to forge an interstellar empire. Along the way they have explored a path 5,000 parsecs coreward from their homeworld, drawn by an Ancient artefact to seek what lies at the end. Because of the fear the Vilani and Solomani have of psionics, the Zhodani and the Imperium have fought four wars and a fifth seems imminent.

## BIRTH OF THE ZHODANI

Humans evolved on Terra – it therefore came as a great shock for explorers from Earth to travel to the stars only to find other humans not only there already but ruling vast empires such as the First Imperium. It took many centuries to establish that all the races of Humaniti originated on Terra and were spread to worlds across charted space some 300,000 years before by the mysterious Ancients.

Of all these far-flung races of Humaniti, only three developed jump drive technology on their own: the Vilani of the First Imperium, the Solomani of Earth and the Zhodani. By Imperial standards, the Zhodani are the most alien.

The Zhodani have the longest unbroken stretch of interstellar civilization of any branch of Humaniti. Unlike the Solomani and Vilani, they did not experience a Long Night. However, they suffered their own tragedies, having faced near-extermination in their pre-history, overcoming that to achieve space flight, thrown back to another dark age, only to rise again with a unique civilization based around the power of the mind.

Even before they reached into space, the Zhodani developed the science of psionics and integrated it into their society. The result was a culture in which people act, and also think, in a different way – and one that possessed radically different values than those of the Solomani and Vilani-dominated Third Imperium.

## PHYSIOLOGY

While human in all respects, the Zhodani differ slightly in appearance from those of Solomani or Vilani ancestry. They tend to be tall and lithe, averaging close to two meters in height and massing roughly 90 kilograms. Complexions are predominantly swarthy and hair colour usually black or brown. Blond hair is uncommon but a mutation that occurred on Zhdant in the last 10,000 years made prematurely grey hair twice as common as red hair.

Zhodani have 28 relatively large teeth in contrast to the 32 possessed by Solomani and Vilani. This is not especially noticeable but does mean a brief dental examination can identify Zhodani (unless they have been surgically disguised for operations within the Imperium).

All physiological characteristics of Zhodani are the result of two factors; the original gene pool of humans who first inhabited Zhdant and minor mutations or developments that took place during the 300,000 years they lived on their new homeworld. Their height and physical build are both consequences of Zhdant's 0.85 g surface gravity.

An evolutionary adaptation allows Zhodani to digest certain proteins native to Zhdant, which are indigestible by off-world humans; eating them may result in digestive problems, allergic reactions or food poisoning. Restaurants in regions frequented by non-Zhodani humans (such as starports on the Zhodani-Imperial border) have menus that mark which foods are or are not appropriate for non-Zhodani. Likewise, caterers at official diplomatic receptions will be aware of the problem. Travellers eating elsewhere in the Consulate should exercise caution.

## SOCIETY

The fact that psionics make up a major part of everyday life within the Consulate has had a profound influence on the mental and emotional makeup of its people. While they are human, their way of looking at life is quite different from most non-psionic human cultures. It has been said that psionics have made the Zhodani Consulate government the most effective, powerful and absolute tyranny in human history – and also the happiest and most stable state to live in. Both of these statements may be true.

In contrast to the patchwork quilt of planetary societies making up the Third Imperium (whose techno-feudalism is an overlay that affects interstellar politics but rarely daily life), the worlds of the Consulate possess a homogenous society that, despite minor variations for local conditions, is essentially the same from planet-to-planet across its expanse.

Zhodani society is divided into three hereditary groups.

Nobles perform all elective governmental functions. They are the only inhabitants of the Consulate allowed to vote and be elected to office. Not all Nobles work in government

- some have senior military positions, manage large

hereditary estates or engage in artistic pursuits. Nearly 6% of the Zhodani population are Nobles.

Intendants are the psi-trained middle class. They include most bureaucrats, business and project managers, merchant captains and officers, teachers, psychologists and doctors, police and journalists (although some Nobles may also be found in these positions). Many serve as psionic troops (technically 'commissioned specialists') or military officers. Intendants also act as personal aides to individual Nobles. They make up about 15% of the population.

Proles are the commoners of Zhodani society and the largest social class. Proles include farmers and factory workers, supervisory and junior managers, small business owners and shopkeepers, enlisted soldiers and starship crews, scientists and technicians, and common labourers. Just over 79% of the Zhodani population are Proles.

There is a huge gulf between the lower-class Proles and higher-class Intendants and Nobles. That divide lies in psionics: possession and use of psionic abilities define the upper classes. Nobles and Intendants receive training in psionics from childhood. Only a high degree of talent allows movement from the Prole to Intendant class; when a Prole child is tested and found to have high psionic strength, they are adopted into an Intendant family and raised as an Intendant. Note that children of Intendants and Nobles who have a low degree of talent still receive psionic training and inherit their parents' social status. Similarly, Intendants and Nobles who suffer a permanent loss of talent (such as from an accident) do not lose their standing.

The Zhodani have been sexually egalitarian since their dark ages, largely because of the emphasis on mental rather than physical strength. Marriage between different classes is illegal; liaisons do occur but (especially between Prole and Noble) are socially disapproved of.

## SPIRITUALISM AND PHILOSOPHY

The Zhodani do not have religion for they do not acknowledge, let alone worship, any sort of supreme being, nor do they believe in an afterlife in any conventional sense. Instead, they have what some Imperial academics have termed a vaguely Buddhist/ vaguely 'green' philosophy. Tavrziansh (Morality's Path) is taught in schools as fact and endorsed by the state as a component of 'proper thought'. It is governed by a small organization, academic and secular, the Fevranzhtavrchedl' (Guardians of the Book), which every 50 years or so releases a slightly modified version of the Fevranzhtavr (the Book of Morality).

Morality's Path holds that life is a matter of duty. Duty arose with life; even the humblest creatures have and perform their duty, in an unconscious 'state of grace'. Nevertheless, even unintelligent life can fail in its duty. A plague of rodents, philosophically, indicates the rodents have forgotten their place and corrective measures would be justified.

With intelligence comes the ability to understand one's duty to all life and most especially to one's own people. Duty to race takes priority over all other duties but it is most praiseworthy to keep one's duties from coming into conflict. Zhodani can contemplate war, even genocide, to protect their people but they follow Morality's Path better if they protect other life, especially intelligent life, as well.

Duty is also the watchword of the individual. Everyone understands that they have a duty to the race; Proles do their duty in one way, Intendants and Nobles in another. Part of this duty is to recognize the duties of others and work to harmonise yours with theirs.

Death, to the Zhodani, is not a complete ending. The evil (that is, failure of duty) of the individual spirit will be lost. The good of the spirit will merge for a time with the universal energy field, the Tavrian, and then return to another Zhodani. The more dutiful the spirit, the more personality (and possibly even memory) will remain; this resembles reincarnation. An undutiful spirit diminishes in proportion to its failures. However, actual demotion on the 'chain of being' is rare. It would be a very bad Noble who returned as a Prole and a very bad Prole who returned as, for instance, an Imperial or rodent.

Dutiful spirits advance. Merit in Morality's Path, is tied with psionic power, at least as far as Zhodani spirits are concerned (Morality's Path recognizes spirits and duty of other races but has little to say about them). When a Prole displays psionic power, it means they showed great devotion to duty in their previous cycles and now receives greater duties as a reward. Interestingly, this is also a sign of past devotion in the family of such a Prole. Witnessing and participating in the elevation of a spirit is a sign that the parents themselves are also worthy; by performing their duty to their talented child, they confirm their worthiness. In some later cycle, their spirits will rise as well.

The spread of psionic training in the Consulate, and gradual increase in the proportion of Nobles and Intendants, proves the Consulate as a whole is behaving well and that the Zhodani as a whole are performing their duty to all life.

Imperial scholars and political scientists feel certain that Morality's Path and its brief holy book, the Book of Morality, were not organic developments of Zhodani belief. Later versions of the book do not reflect development of philosophy but rather a more skilled presentation of the underlying message: 'Conform, be good and you might be a Noble someday.'

## CUSTOMS

Zhodani society's acceptance and use of psionics strongly influences the way they think. It differs from that of the average Imperial citizen in many respects.

Extensive psionic ability among the ruling classes has permitted the Zhodani to weed out criminal personalities and potential subversives early in life and re-educate them as useful members of society. Thus, there has been practically no serious crime or dissent for thousands of years. One of the foremost values (which Imperial humans notice most quickly) is the fundamental honesty that pervades everything. Walls protect from the elements rather than from intruders. Locks are rare and most are safety devices to protect children rather than anti-theft precautions. Laws deal more with appropriate action than actual crime.

At first glance, the idea of negotiation, or bargaining, in a psionic society appears impossible. Looking deeper shows the practice is alive and well. Bargaining occurs when market pressures produce varying prices for goods and each side in the encounter tries to obtain the most advantageous price for the transaction.

Negotiators with psionics might be able to read the mind of their opponent, determine the worst acceptable offer and then offer that. Obviously, a psionic negotiator has a tremendous advantage but this model is simplistic. A

Zhodani does not approach a negotiation with thoughts of 'what can I get out of this deal' but rather 'what do I believe my work is truly worth' or 'what do I believe I deserve for my labour and skill'. Anyone reading those thoughts may still disagree and negotiate but there is no dishonesty in the process.

In any case, Zhodani view the use of psionics in such a situation as unfair, much like reading a teacher's mind for answers to test questions.

Regard for social superiors is a natural part of Zhodani society, ingrained into everyone. Of course, for true respect to persist, Nobles must earn it. Many do so in a roundabout way – their Intendants make sure they receive credit for a great many worthy activities. It is in the best interest of an Intendant to make their superior Noble look good because that Noble is responsible for their promotion and advancement.

Zhodani are largely conformists. Everyone knows the relatively narrow band of activities that all members of society understand and approve of, and everyone strives to act within that range. This extends to many areas of culture. Even the range of acceptable dress (while wide) is rarely exceeded. Interests rarely involve strange or unsuitable subjects. Too much deviation from the norm is considered an aberration and subject to re-education.

While Nobles have more freedom of thought than Proles, they are still subject to human failings. Eccentric Nobles, while rare, can and do still appear. Noble children are subject to careful psionic supervision when they are babies and pre-adolescents, so by the time they are proficient enough to possess mind-shields (usually as early adolescents) and have earned the right to mental privacy, they have been thoroughly integrated into Zhodani cultural mores.

Zhodani feel uncomfortable outside the Consulate, where 'liars and thieves are allowed to wander' and fundamental values of Zhodani society are not enforced. Moreover, as Zhodani lack racial diversity, the average Zhodani has had little experience with other types of Humaniti, who appear strange or unusual to their eyes. These two impressions tend to mingle, resulting in an instinctive distrust of anyone with non-Zhodani features.

## PROLES

The aspirations of the Proles are generally limited to economic and personal goals – to succeed at whatever they do and thus win financial security and personal satisfaction. While many individuals are content to do their jobs and enjoy happy lives, Proles with more ambition may seek to excel within a discipline, be it as an artist, athlete, scientist, explorer or whatever. Alternatively, they may seek economic success, perhaps using earnings to open a small business or working hard to impress superiors to win promotion and higher salaries.

However, this ambition has a definite ceiling: Proles working within an organization can attain junior management, supervisory or non-commissioned officer (NCO) positions that involve supervising other Proles but they will never rise to policy-making, executive, command or commissioned officer posts.

As such, the social ambition of Proles is sublimated into ambition for their children – hopes that they (or their grandchildren) will have great enough psionic power to warrant training and elevation into the Intendant class.

## INTENDANTS

As with Proles, an Intendant's childhood education will result from natural aptitudes being identified and trained for a suitable and necessary career. Additionally, psionic training is an important part of an Intendant's education.

After their studies (which may include education at a local or off-world university or college), records will be sent to those Nobles or public- and private-sector organizations that express a need for new Intendants with that career path. Usually, an Intendant will have already made such contacts during their studies and there will be a job waiting. Often, there will be a number of choices, some of which may require travel and interviews. Because the Intendant's education is geared toward the career, there is rarely any difficulty finding a position.

Each Noble has one Intendant specifically assigned to them; this direct relationship provides the Noble with a capable secretary and assistant. Such positions are avidly sought after by ambitious Intendants since much of the fame and power of a strong Noble rubs off on their personal Intendant.

Other Intendants take positions within corporations or institutes, the military, professions that require psionics (including psychologists, sociologists and teachers) or as secondary personal assistants with specific duties or assignments for Nobles. The remainder of the Intendant population works for the generalised bureaucracy that allows the Consulate government to function.

Intendant ambition centres on elevation to the Noble class. One method is through participation in the Thequzdievl, the Psionic Games (see page 254), which brings psionically powerful individuals to the Noble class; perhaps 10% of Intendants are elevated to the Nobility in this way. Another is as a reward for faithful service; another 10% of Intendants achieve this, usually near the end of their careers. Some Intendants strive for such rewards, while others are reasonably happy with their existing place in society.

## NOBLES

Nobles have more freedom to shape their own destiny than Intendants. From childhood, their education has a focus on psionic training and fostering proper social attitudes, with a more generalised 'classical' education on leadership, psychology and personnel management.

From the Noble's perspective, the most important skill is to be a good manager, to know which Intendants are doing a good job and which are simply time-servers, and how to motivate them. Since Intendants are also psionically trained (and thus, in many cases, their minds cannot be casually read), motivating them requires more skill than dealing with Proles whose thoughts are an open book.

There are several ranks of Nobility in Zhodani society. These do not come with hereditary government positions (which are elective) but correlate with the influence (and often wealth and estates) of a family. A member of the higher ranks of the Nobility will be expected to live up to his title; if they do so, they can benefit from its prestige and the social connections that come with it to rise far more rapidly through the military or be elected more easily to higher office.

## LAW

The character of crime in the Consulate is markedly different from that of other societies. Responsibility for law enforcement is maintained by the Tavrchedl'
(the Thought Police), who are as much concerned with mental health as actual deeds.

Three broad categories of crime are recognized among the Zhodani: inadvertent, incited and insane offenses. The concept of premeditated crime for personal gain is considered insane.

**Inadvertent crime** is an unintentional violation or infraction of the law, usually resulting from inattention or distraction. Examples include accidental violations of traffic or other regulations, failure to return borrowed materials to a lender or forgetting an appointment with a Noble. For minor cases, the punishment is a small fine, to compensate society and encourage the offender to be more thoughtful in the future. If significant damage or injury resulted, recompense to society can be substantial and extreme cases may be taken as evidence of wilful negligence requiring re-education, although such are rare.

Incited crime is an infraction of a law brought about by another. Often it results from an overreaction by an individual to an inadvertent crime or misfortune. For example, if someone responds violently to a perceived insult or injustice, this in an incited crime; Zhodani recognize that people can perform wrong actions out of anger or despair. This mitigates wrongdoing, if the crime is not unduly disproportionate to the situation but does not excuse it. The solution is re-education – often, the incited individual is seen as weak-willed or vulnerable because of a character flaw or subconscious fault. Re-education uses psychological and psionic techniques to remedy this flaw, retraining the individual to recognize similar provocations and avoid or properly handle them. Sometimes, the investigation of an incited crime will turn up an actual injustice: which will also be dealt with in as fair a manner as possible.

Those who have been outside the Consulate and have trouble behaving and thinking in a proper way when they return sometimes fall into this category.

Insane crime covers most major crimes against property or individuals, including theft, rape, premeditated assault, treason and murder. Zhodani believe that any individual who commits such a crime must be insane and sentences for insane crimes call for re-education until the insanity is cured. Sometimes the offender's personality must be rebuilt and, in rare instances, an execution will be ordered if the individual appears incurable.

Note that someone caught thinking about performing a crime may be arrested and judged guilty if mental examination shows there was serious intent to commit the actual deed.

## JUSTICE

Technically, all Nobles are empowered to sit in judgment of any accused criminal. In practice, Nobles not trained in telepathy are expected to defer judgment until a telepath can be found.

Cases are presided over by a Noble consul from the community council of the area where the crime was committed. If there are multiple Nobles on a council with telepathic abilities, the case will go to whichever Noble is not otherwise occupied. Some councils rotate judicial duties among themselves; others have a few Nobles that specialize in them. If a region, facility or ship is under military control, a Noble officer will handle the case.

Procedures are informal, the Noble listens to the case and considers the facts presented. In a dispute between two parties, the Noble will hear both sides and additional facts are gathered by reading the minds of those involved. If necessary, the Noble may dispatch Thought Police investigators to locate evidence, suspects or additional witnesses. A judgment is made and the decision recorded, usually sent telepathically to an Intendant clerk in the local records center.

Crimes committed by Nobles and Intendants are treated as special cases, since a Noble of higher rank than the accused must judge them. Inadvertent crimes are handled with a warning or admonition; repeated errors might also result in the Noble or Intendant being dismissed from their present job or losing hope of further promotion.

Nobles are believed, under the law, to be incapable of incited crimes. Insane crimes reflect a breakdown in a Noble's personality (portrayed to Proles as the result of overwork and demands of responsibility). Minor violations may be let off with a warning and usually a short or lengthy enforced vacation from work: major crimes call for re-education. For the good of all, a convicted Noble is usually transferred to another location or world after re-education. Intendants are also re-educated but usually revert to Proles and have mental blocks placed in their minds to make them forget how to use their psionic talents.

### Re-education

The cure for any aberrant behaviour is re-education. Psionics has made this extremely efficient and studies confirmed which educational techniques worked and how efficiently, allowing academics to plan lessons with and create examinations that confirm success. Psychologists and mental health professionals study the mind and develop mood and behaviour-altering techniques with levels of effectiveness unheard of elsewhere.

The result is excellent diagnosis and careful treatment in re-education centres. While duration of treatment will vary depending on the patient and complexity of the issues, when treatment is completed the individual re-joins society without stigma or blot. Re-education is viewed by Zhodani like a period of recovery from illness.

Proles It is important to remember that Proles are not citizens. They are subject to the jurisdiction of the Consulate, as manifested through the local government council in the region they reside or, in the case of individuals working directly for a consular agency (such as the military), that organization's hierarchy.

Proles are not serfs owned by a Noble family but are considered dependents of the Consulate as a whole. If a Prole wishes to change job and move to another town or planet, and can afford to pay for moving and transport, they still require permission of the local council. In practice, all this means is letting the council office know they are moving and explaining why to an Intendant bureaucrat. If they have a good reason to do so, such as an opportunity for a new, better-paying job or a region whose schools better suit the aptitudes of their children, the request will be routinely approved. If the decision seems frivolous, or not in the Prole's own best interest, the council may not grant it and the Thought Police will inquire into their mental health – why are they unhappy enough to want to change their job and move to a different location?

This is an important fact to remember; all of a Prole's major decisions are subject to the scrutiny of the Thought Police and upper classes (or superior officers, if the Prole is in the military). If their actions seem ill considered or unhealthy, the government may intervene for the Prole's own good.

Intendants and Nobles Privacy of thought is highly respected by Intendants and Nobles as their greatest freedom; Proles have no such rights. Nobles have an almost complete right of privacy and Intendants nearly as much; in either case, it can only be breached if there is suspicion (in the case of an Intendant) or clear proof (for a Noble) that the individual is guilty of aberrant thought.

In other ways, Intendants have less freedom than Proles do. Membership of this class carries a precondition of service: Intendants are expected to be engaged in socially acceptable work under the close supervision of the Nobility. Soon after reaching adulthood an Intendant will select a career path and generally remain in that career until either retirement (with pension) or successful promotion to the Nobility. Retired Intendants have somewhat more freedom and usually end up raising a family, taking up travel or becoming involved in hobbies or personal business pursuits.

Nobles are, to a large degree, as free as any Imperial citizen. They have the right to vote or hold office and are free to travel and do as they wish, provided they obey Consular laws. Those who choose to enter military service or join a government agency will, of course, be expected to obey their superior officers.

## ART

Artists have an important role in Zhodani society. Zhodani fine arts are much the same as those in the Imperium: painting, music, sculpture, theatre and literary endeavors all thrive. The Zhodani have one significant difference in the practice of their art, however.

An artist with telepathy soon learns what provokes a response. For example, a Zhodani artist learns exactly what mural to put in a dental waiting room to calm nervous patients. They know what effects specific colours have on viewers and can achieve exact (and sometimes subliminal) results through their artwork.

Because of the conformist nature of Zhodani society, most Zhodani art seems limited and unimaginative by Imperial standards. Zhodani artists are not placed under any legal restrictions or censorship, however. They simply know what is acceptable to society as a whole and remain within those limits voluntarily. Zhodani artists do not feel compelled to stretch the limits of their expression, as do many Imperial artists, and argue that their creativity is not stunted by the restrictions they work under.

## DRESS

The most distinctive elements of Zhodani dress are the turbans and cloaks worn by the Nobility, along with the stylish beards male Nobles favor and the headbands worn by Intendants. However, there is much more to Zhodani dress than this.

In work roles, Zhodani wear practical clothing to fit their station and responsibilities. At other times, Zhodani prefer comfortable, loose clothing (often trousers and tunics), generally made of lighter fabrics. During appropriate holidays, Proles can wear quite outlandish colours and clothes but the Nobility tend to be more restrained. Noble fashion is intended to provoke a response of respect and deference, and no Noble would ever go out in public in anything less.

## ROBOTICS

Almost every industrialised race uses robots in their factories but the vast majority are nothing more than reprogrammable machine tools that remain fixed in place. Zhodani use industrial robots but also mobile robots to a much greater degree than other major races outside of the Hivers.

The fact that robots do not have minds that can be communicated with through ordinary telepathy means that Zhodani do not try to anthropomorphise robots to the same degree as the Imperium. An Intendant or Noble need only to try to touch a robot's mind to know it is not 'alive' or see inside the machine's body with ESP to reveal its workings. Nor, in closely monitored Zhodani society, are the fears and prejudices other races have about a 'robot revolt' or 'android doubles' likely to occur – at least, not without swift treatment by the Thought Police.

Lacking biases that limit the use of mobile robots in the Imperium, it is not surprising that Zhodani make a greater use of them. However, the Zhodani preference for psionics has slowed the development of advanced Artificial Intelligence; instead, Zhodani robots are designed to receive orders from both computer inputs and psionically. As a result, they do require no great intellect. The role of robots in Zhodani society is simple; machines do repetitious or dangerous jobs, freeing Zhodani for safer or more rewarding pursuits.

## THE MILITARY

Although they do not consider themselves a warrior people, the Zhodani do have a lengthy military tradition. There are three major services: the Navy, Army and Consular Guard.

In the Zhodani military, Intendants and Nobles cannot hold enlisted rank. The lowest rank held by either is that of commissioned specialist, roughly equivalent to the lowest officer grades in the Imperial military. Commissioned specialists are officers by virtue of their psionic training, however, and although they hold officer-equivalent rank, they are not in the chain of command and do not give orders (an equivalent in the Imperial military is that of doctor, who holds a commission and officer-equivalent rank but is not in the chain of command). In addition, some positions require both a specific psionic talent and command responsibilities, such as the commander of a commando groupment.

Technicians, drivers, gunners, non-commissioned officers (NCOs) and so on are Proles. The Zhodani have also long used mobile robots as part of their armed forces.

## NAVAL ORGANISATION

The Consulate Navy carries out two principle duties: exploration and maintenance of the status quo. Exploration is driven by several long-range missions in the direction of the galactic core and the Navy also engages in scientific research and short-range survey operations closer to home, coordinating private and corporate research operations to cover gaps in its activities.

To maintain the status quo, the Consulate has developed a defensive perspective that accepts the need for pre-emptive strikes to shape the thinking of neighboring states or remove a prospective threat.

The Consular Navy is tasked with obtaining space superiority during war, besieging enemy worlds and protecting interstellar trade routes within the Zhodani Consulate. It is mainly equipped at TL12–14 but a small number of TL15 ships have been produced since the Fourth Frontier War. The Consular Navy is organised into eight provincial fleets, one per province, and in peacetime is nominally managed by provincial councils. Zhodani squadrons tend to follow a similar organization to that of the Imperium, with frontier systems defended by squadrons of battleships and cruisers and battle rider squadrons held back in reserve fleets within the Consulate.

The biggest difference between the Consular and Imperial Navy is that a good percentage of the former's ships are occupied with exploration duties, which in the Imperium would be the province of the Scout Service. Some Zhodani ships are dedicated exploration vessels packed with scientific instruments, while others serve as escorts or embark on armed reconnaissance missions. Many are tasked with supporting the core expeditions but exploration also continues in other directions, albeit at a much slower pace.

This 'warrior-explorer ethic' has a strong effect on Zhodani naval culture. Many Zhodani officers possess advanced degrees in sophontology or other scientific fields, as well as engineering and naval tactics, and senior officers will have spent a term or so serving on an exploration mission; as such, they are expected to be diplomats as well as soldiers.

## ARMY AND GUARD ORGANISATION

The Zhodani Army comprises the planetary-armed fighting forces of individual worlds and subsectors within the Consulate, dealing with planetary surface actions, battles and campaigns. Where necessary, they may serve as ship's troops aboard naval vessels. The army, like the navy, has its own command structure, which parallels governmental council structure. Consular Guard units, however, are under direct authority of the Qlomdlabr, the supreme council of the Consulate.

Leader-of-five Zhof Ievrepl is a native of Sriezdazh, a high-population, mid-tech world in the Ziafrplians sector. Like many members of the Prole class he aspired to a career of honorable service to the Consulate and joined the Zhodani Consulate Combined Interstellar Forces. The selection process indicated that physically he had an aptitude for low-gravity operations whilst mentally he was inclined towards steadiness and tenacity. These were ideal characteristics for a marine, so after basic training Zhof reported aboard Mobile Training Facility _Enjosiebr_.

By the time _Enjosiebr_ arrived at Cronor in the Spinward Marches, Zhof was a qualified Consular Marine. Unlike most members of his contingent, he did not transfer to a navy ship or base but was instead selected for the honor of remaining aboard as part of the Advanced Training Cadre during the next voyage of _Enjosiebr_. At the end of this voyage, Zhof joined the troops-aboard contingent of the heavy cruiser _Setlflal_ with the rank of Follower and, as expected, quickly advanced to lead his squad when his Leader-of-five was promoted.

Zhof is qualified in all aspects of troops-aboard operations, including low-gravity combat, explosives and breaching equipment. His personal specialism is close combat and he holds the position of Third Instructor of Hand Weapons to his shipboard contingent. Whilst this is not a particularly noteworthy position it is a portent of things to come and Zhof hopes one day to become an instructor to the family of a noble, perhaps by way of serving as a member of the Close Guard surrounding a senior officer. The ship's Mentor-of-Aspirations team has noted this ambition and pronounced it both worthy and attainable.

## PRIMARY WEAPON

The primary weapon of most Consular Marines is the Personal Energy Weapon Riebchi, generally referred to as the 'Consular carbine' by non-Zhodani observers. A standard direct-feed laser device, the Riebchi varies mainly in its inclusion of a rechargeable battery pack under the collimator tube. This permits 6–7 shots from the weapon if its backpack power supply is disconnected. The battery pack can be disconnected and used as an emergency power source for a damaged combat armor suit's life support or other light equipment.

## SECONDARY WEAPON

Zhof Ievrepl is equipped for close combat with a Standardised Medium Blade Weapon Vranz, typically known as the 'Vranz pattern boarding sword' outside the Consulate. The Vranz is a straight-bladed cut-and-thrust weapon which, despite its appearance, is primarily used for thrusting actions, which give a better chance of penetrating armor. As an instructor for this weapon, Zhof has the honor of wearing a stylised image of it among his insignia.

## COMBAT ARMOR

Zhof wears standard Consulate-issue non-power-assisted combat armor. Lighter than its Imperial equivalent, Zhodani armor uses articulated plates over a resilient flexible base with multiple-redundant life support and wound-management systems. The suit provides slightly better protection against radiation and electromagnetic threats than Imperial armor, and is designed to permit maximum agility at the expense of some physical protection.

## HELMET

Zhof's helmet uses the standard Consulate 'big eyes' design – as many Imperials call it – which incorporates multispectral emitters/sensors and user displays in the lower part of the 'eyes'. Although the design of the eyes is considered by some to create weak points in the helmet front, the difference from a single faceplate design is so small as to be negligible. The helmet also contains communications receptors and an independently powered communications unit. This gives a downed trooper a last chance to call for help even after suit failure, or pass along information, enemy coordinates, or a final inspiring message to his comrades.

## OPERATIONS PACK

Consulate combat armor can be used without a backpack, using a small distributed power storage array, but normally one of several operations packs are carried. In addition to power for the suit and any weapons carried, a standard operations pack contains tools, a breaching charge, a thrust pistol for open-space operations and additional equipment as assigned. This usually includes one or more hand grenades, an electronic intrusion kit and similar mission-specific items.

## SECURITY AND INTELLIGENCE

The Tozjabr (literally, 'the eye and the hand') is the Consulate's primary intelligence and covert operations agency. The institution is relatively young, having been established during the period of tension that led to the First Frontier War. Prior to establishment of the Tozjabr, intelligence gathering activities and special operations had been handled by various military branches and diplomatic offices, assisted by the Thought Police.

Faced with confrontation with a polity the size of the Third Imperium, the Qlomdlabr realised that treating covert operations as an adjunct to other operations was no longer practical. With the need for a dedicated covert operations and foreign intelligence organization identified, the Qlomdlabr established the Tozjabr as a civilian body independent of all other agencies, including the Thought Police.

The Zhodani character makes finding suitable candidates for undercover agents and giving them proper training a difficult proposition, even with telepathy. The stress of making decisions and compromises alien to Zhodani culture can be considerable. Extensive counselling is given to operatives before retirement but a small number of Tozjabr agents are unable to readjust to life in the Consulate and have required re-education or, in a few cases, turned to crime or defected to foreign powers.

### ZHODANI TRAVELLERS

Zhodani Travellers follow the same procedures and concepts as human Travellers, as detailed in the _Traveller Core Rulebook_. However, several changes take into account the cultural differences between Zhodani characters and other humans. Unless otherwise stated in this chapter, use all the creation and career rules described in the _Traveller Core Rulebook_.

## INITIAL TRAVELLER GENERATION

Use the characteristics and traits for Zhodani Travellers shown below:

### Characteristics

Zhodani roll 2D for the PSI characteristic at the start of Traveller generation. Note that there is no reduction in PSI by terms of service (as indicated in the _Traveller Core Rulebook_ ) for Zhodani, as they are tested before they enter a career.

Optionally, the Referee may allow PSI to be rolled using 1D+6 in order to create a greater proportion of Intendants and Nobles.

### Characteristic Adjustments

In the Consulate, all children are tested for psionic potential, while children of Nobles and Intendants receive better educations than Proles.

- If a Traveller rolls PSI 9+ and SOC 9-, raise their

SOC to 10.

- EDU cannot be higher than SOC, and should be

lowered to the SOC value if it is greater.

- If a Traveller rolls EDU 7- and SOC 10+, increase

EDU to 8.

These adjustments apply only at the start of Traveller generation. They do not apply if a Traveller's SOC changes because of career events or if PSI changes due to aging effects.

## STARTING AGE

Zhodani characters begin their careers at 18 years of age. Untrained and inexperienced, they embark on a career to gain new skills and experience. Each career term lasts for four Imperial years.

### Social Classification

Zhodani society has three broad social classes and SOC determines to which a Traveller belongs.

Noble: SOC 11+

Intendant: SOC 10

Prole: SOC 9-

Noble Titles Zhodani Intendants and Nobles are identified by a suffix to their names. A new name suffix replaces the previous one when an individual rises in SOC.

```
SOC Title Suffix Translation 10 -iepr Intendant 11 -atl Aspirant 12 -stebr Wellborn 13 -tlas Highborn 14 -tlasche' Noble Born 15 -iashav Princely Lord
```

While these do not directly correlate to Imperial noble titles, Zhodani Travellers visiting the Imperium are generally accorded status and honors based on their SOC.

### Psionic Training

Nobles and Intendants (not Proles) undergo standardised psionic training at an early age. As part of training, the Traveller attempts to learn the common psionic talents on the Psionic Training table by making a PSI check. The Traveller may attempt to learn the talents in any order but suffers a cumulative DM-1 per check attempted. If a Traveller learns a talent, they gain that talent at level 0.

Psionic Training Talent Learning DM Awareness +1 Clairvoyance +3 Telekinesis +2 Telepathy +4 Teleportation +0 Zhodani* –3

- New psionic talent detailed on page 277.

If a Prole gains PSI 9+ during a career, they are elevated to Intendant (increasing their SOC to 10) and immediately undergo this same training.

### The Psionic Games

Any Intendant may apply once during their lifetime to compete in the Thequzdievl, the Psionic Games, by making a PSI check. If successful, the Intendant devotes that term of service to competition in the Psionic Games instead of a career. The term still counts as a term in the Traveller's current career, except no survival or advancement checks are made, nor are skills gained from career skill tables.

Preliminary Competitions: For each psionic talent the Traveller is skilled in, make an Average (8+) check. Record the number of successes and failures.

Final Competition: Roll PSI 12+ to win the final competition, with DM+1 for each successful preliminary competition and DM-1 for each failed preliminary competition.

Awards: After the final competition, the Traveller receives PSI +1 if more preliminary competitions were successful than failed. A winner of the final competition receives PSI +2 and becomes a Noble, raising SOC to 11.

## CAREERS

Zhodani careers, in general, are used in the same way as described in the _Traveller Core Rulebook_. However, there are exceptions, which are noted here.

While Zhodani share most careers with other human cultures, there are some differences. The Agent career has no corporate specialty, as corporations within the Consulate do not conduct trade wars or espionage against each other. There is no specific career for Nobles, although the Government career shares some similarities. There is no Scout career, as that is specific to the Imperium. There is no Rogue career, as that represents behaviour considered unhealthy by Zhodani society. Finally, the pervasiveness of a psionic society requires changes across all careers.

Zhodani Travellers have no penalty for changing career, as Zhodani society recognizes that a new perspective on life is mentally healthy and often desirable.

The Draft Zhodani use the following Draft table if they fail to qualify for a career.

Draft 1D Career (speciality)
–3 Army (any) 4–5 Merchant (corporate) 6 Navy (any)

Skills Skills are determined as normal but there is an additional skill table for all careers except Prole. Travellers may only roll on the Psionic Skills table if they have Soc 10+.

Psionic Skills: Intendants and Nobles may develop talents over time as if they were normal skills. If they receive a talent they were not trained in or failed to gain during their initial psionic training, they may attempt again to gain that talent (all previous DMs apply, including the cumulative DM-1 per previous check). If a Traveller rolls the Talent skill choice, they may increase any psionic talent already possessed.

Rare Skills: The Deception, Gambling and Streetwise skills are generally not permitted to Zhodani Travellers. Deception and Streetwise can be gained by those in the Agent (tozjabr) career, as they deal with non-Zhodani who engage in unhealthy activities. However, Gambling is unknown in Zhodani society.

### Commission and Advancement

Zhodani society favors the careers of Intendants and, especially, Nobles. The following rules apply to all Zhodani Travellers.

- Nobles and Intendants automatically succeed with

Advancement (Commission if appropriate) in their first term of service, unless they are draftees.

- Drafted Nobles and Intendants receive automatic

Advancement (Commission if appropriate) in their second term of service.

- Nobles gain DM+1 to all Advancement rolls.
- Proles and Intendants in the Government career may

not advance higher than Rank3 (Executive).

## EVENTS TABLE

### Zhodani Life Events

1D Event 2 Sickness or Injury: You are injured or contract a serious illness. Roll on the Injury table. 3 Birth or Death: Someone close to you dies, such as a friend or family member.

On a 3-4 your partner leaves. On a 5–6 you leaves your partner. 5 Improved Relationship: A romantic relationship involving you deepens, possibly leading to marriage or some other emotional commitment. 6 New Relationship: You become romantically involved with an existing Ally or Contact.

If you are a Prole and this increases PSI above 8, you are elevated to the Intendant class (raising your SOC to 10) and sent to psionic training. 2 Aliens: You spend time among an alien race. Gain Language and a Contact with a member of that alien race. 3 Alien artefact: You come into possession of a curious piece of alien technology or an archaeological relic. 4 Amnesia : Something happened to you but you do not know what it was. Regardless of SOC, roll on the Re-education Events table (see table below). 5 Contact with Government: You have brief contact with the highest echelons of Consulate government. Gain one Benefit roll in your current career. 6 Ancient Technology: You have an item believed to be left behind by the Ancients. Because it interacts with you in a unique fashion, you have been allowed to keep it but both the item and you remain objects of occasional study by Consulate scientists and researchers.

## RE-EDUCATION EVENTS

For Proles, re-education is an important part of proper mental health. Intendants and Nobles are only sent to re-education in more serious circumstances. There is no social stigma for re-education; it is viewed as being as necessary as surgery is for physical health. Time spent in re-education does not count as time in a career for Benefit rolls, Advancement or gaining skills; it does count for aging.

Re-education Events 1D Event 1 Re-education requires two terms. You must enter a new career and reduce END by –1. If SOC 11+, reduce SOC by –1, to a minimum of 11. 2 Re-education requires one term. You must enter a new career and reduce END by –1. If SOC 11+, reduce SOC by –1, to a minimum of 11. 3 Re-education requires one term but you can continue this career. 4 Re-education requires less than a year and your career is not affected. 5 Fine of Cr1000 x 1D; you do not require re-education. 6 Exonerated! Receive an additional Benefit roll in your current career.

### Anagathics

Use the number of terms since you started taking anagathics as a negative DM to rolls on the Re-education Events table.

## MUSTERING OUT

Benefits are granted at the end of career service, as detailed on page 45 of the _Traveller Core Rulebook_. Zhodani have access to new mustering out benefits.

### Courier

You receive a Yetsasl courier with 25% of the mortgage paid off on it. This courier is identical to the one on page 296 but you must roll 1D times on the Outdated Ships Table on page 164 of the _Traveller Core Rulebook_. If you roll this benefit again, an additional 25% of the mortgage has been paid off – if you roll this benefit four times, the courier will have no mortgage and it will be all yours!

### Nenj

The Nenjchinzhe'driante (the Consular Legion of Merit) is a post-career recognition of valuable service to all Zhodani. Membership in the Consular Legion of

Merit is egalitarian – Nobles, Intendants and Proles are all eligible for the award. Those who have won enrolment are entitled to wear the distinctive gold sash of honor that marks them as recognized elite of the Consulate.

Although it is largely honorary, members do receive concrete benefits. Zhodani citizens almost invariably grant members a 10% discount on just about everything, from meals to equipment purchases to starship passages. Sums of more than MCr1 are rarely so discounted but bank loans in these amounts are made without interest. Membership is for life and is not transferable but companions of a member may share in the benefits when they do the buying.

Scout: You receive a Ninz scout with 25% of the mortgage paid off on it. This scout is identical to the one on page 294 but you must roll 1D times on the Outdated Ships Table on page 165 of the Traveller Core Rulebook. If you roll this benefit again, an additional 25% of the mortgage has been paid off – if you roll this benefit four times, the scout will have no mortgage and it will be all yours!

SOC: SOC may never be increased if it would raise a Prole character's SOC above 9. An unusable SOC increase is taken as a bonus Ship Share.

Trader: You receive a Zdebr trader with 25% of the mortgage paid off on it. This trader is identical to the one on page 298 but you must roll 1D times on the Outdated Ships Table on page 164 of the Traveller Core Rulebook. If you roll this benefit again, an additional 25% of the mortgage has been paid off – if you roll this benefit four times, the trader will have no mortgage and it will be all yours!

Pensions Zhodani Travellers can only receive pension payments within the Consulate. Nobles receive double the amount received.

### Aging Crisis

If PSI is reduced to 0 through aging, it does not constitute an aging crisis but the Traveller loses all psionic abilities and can never regain them. Reduction of PSI through aging does not affect SOC.

Anagathics: Within the Zhodani Consulate, use of anagathics is viewed as a symptom of mental illness. Use the number of terms since the Traveller started taking anagathics as a negative DM to rolls on the Re-education Events table. Additionally, the cost of anagathics in the Consulate is considerably higher than in Imperial space. They will cost Cr200000 x 2D for each term the Traveller uses the drugs.

# ZHODANI PSIONICS

The Zhodani have devoted millennia of study to psionic talents and the finest minds of the Consulate have examined the common psionic talents and discovered others. While these other talents are rare, they provide Zhodani Travellers with interesting ways to expand their psionic abilities.

#### ZHODANI

Zhodani Travellers have access to the Zhodani talent and its abilities.

##### Awareness of Others

The psion may perform any Awareness ability but only upon others and then only if the target is not wearing, or within, a psionic shield.

### Check

As ability

### Reach

As ability

### PSI Cost

As ability +2

### Blocking

Psions with this talent are capable of broadcasting psionic 'static' over some considerable distance, which effectively blocks the use of telepathic abilities, rendering weak telepaths powerless. While a psion maintains blocking, all psions within range (not including himself) suffer a penalty to Telepathy skill checks equal to half the blocking psion's current PSI (rounding down).

A psion entering an area being blocked in this way may make a PSI check to realise they are being blocked. The referee may make this check in secret.

### Check

Average (8+) Zhodani check (1D minutes, PSI)

### Reach

Long

### PSI Cost

4

### Control

The psion is able to control a machine's functions, overriding fixed settings, programming routines and so forth. Machines can be switched on or off and their functions changed, as long as the device is capable of performing the instruction the psion gives to it. The Effect of the Zhodani check indicates the degree of success; lower Effects reflect a partial control over function, whilst higher effects reflect total control. Only one instruction at a time can be given to a machine.

Check: Average (8+) Zhodani check (1D x 10 minutes, PSI)

Reach: Medium PSI Cost: 3

### Empathic Healing

The psion may transfer wounds from others to himself. The PSI cost is equal to the points of damage being transferred. The physical effects of the damage take immediate effect.

Check: Average (8+) Zhodani check (1D minutes, PSI) Reach: Personal PSI Cost: Amount of damage transferred

### Interact

The psion can sense the flow of data within a machine. This allows the psion to react more quickly and smoothly to changes in the data flow, lowering the difficulty of all Computer checks the psion attempts, making them one level easier.

Check: Average (8+) Zhodani check (1D minutes, PSI) Reach: Close PSI Cost: 1

### Interrogate

The psion can 'communicate' psychically with a machine, determining its physical state of repair, properties, age, programming and so forth. The psion effectively reads the psychometric aura that accompanies every device in much the same way an organic aura can be read. The Effect of the Zhodani check determines the depth and extent of the information but does not provide any measure of control.

Examples of information available with Interrogate:

- Effect 0: Who made the machine, when and where.
- Effect 1: Amount of power available in batteries.
- Effect 1: State of repair/damage.
- Effect 2: Access to stored data.
- Effect 2: Specific functions.
- Effect 3: Specific hidden instructions or

programming.

- Effect 4: Hidden functions.

### Check

Average (8+) Zhodani check (1D minutes, PSI)

### Reach

Close

### PSI Cost

2

### Mimic

A psion with this ability has a mental shield, much like any skilled telepath. However, other psions attempting to probe or use other psionic abilities against the mimic must make opposed PSI checks to succeed. If this check is failed, a telepath perceives an unshielded mind having a personality fabricated by the mimic. Clairvoyants will see and/or hear images appropriate to the mimic's fabricated personality, instead of the mimic's true personality.

### Psychic Transfer

### Teleprojection

The psion can perform any Teleportation abilities but only on others and then only if the target is not wearing, or within, a psionic shield. The teleported individual suffers the effects of relative motion or altitude as detailed on page 202 of the Traveller Core Rulebook.

Zhodani equipment across Tech Levels is functionally equivalent to that available in the Imperium. Most equipment is designed at up to TL14 (with an average of TL13); some TL15 items are manufactured on Zhdant and other advanced worlds but these are generally restricted to a few elite government agencies or military units.

Zhodani can use equipment and facilities designed for other human races with little difficulty. One exception comes from Zhodani height; as they average two meters tall, low doors and ceilings can occasionally be awkward, and clothes or armor designed for other humans may require re-tailoring (add +5% to cost) in order to fit properly. Aside from trousers possibly too long in the leg, other races using Zhodani equipment may have a different; equipment intended strictly for use by Nobles or Intendants (such as Guard combat armor or a personal vehicle) may only have psi-sensitive switches, safeties or triggers.

Firearms, other than semi-automatic slug weapons and shotguns, are generally unavailable for sale on Zhodani worlds, regardless of local Law Level, as no local market exists.

## PSIONICS AND TECHNOLOGY

As a psionic culture, the Zhodani look to technology to enhance or improve their talents and abilities. While not all research has been successful, there have been two noteworthy developments. The psi-sensitive switch has been available in Zhodani space for millennia and such switches are built into all technological devices within the Consulate. The psionic interface, on the other hand, is a very recent development and remains uncommon. Because of their nature, Imperial law makes items with either modification illegal to produce or import into the Imperium.

### Psi-sensitive Switch

Technological devices produced in Zhodani territory contain integral psi-sensitive controls (in addition to regular controls), which allow operation from a distance of up to 50 meters by mentally
'flicking'; telekinetic psions can double this distance. These switches are elementary on-off devices used to respond to a command by shifting from one state to the other and can be tripped by anyone psionically trained who has learned the technique. Most Zhodani starships are equipped with such switches, allowing Nobles and Intendants to operate equipment without being in physical contact with it. The cost of such a switch built into a device is negligible.

Modification TL Kg Cost Psi-sensitive Switch 7 — —

Psionic Interface: Any weapon or technological device can be outfitted with a psionic interface. This allows a Traveller using the device or weapon to use their PSI modifier instead of their DEX modifier; this requires physical contact. A Traveller without psionic ability gains no benefit from the interface. Adding a psionic interface increases the cost of the device by 20%.

Modification TL Kg Cost Psionic Interface 14 — +20%

Symbiosis Shielding: Devices can be shielded from the psionic control many Zhodani are capable of. Each level of shielding applies DM-1 to any Zhodani check made to assert control over the device and increases its cost by +10%.

Modification TL Kg Cost Symbiosis Shielding 13 — +10% per DM-1

## ARMOR

Most armor is restricted to military units, or used by Thought Police personnel, and is unavailable for sale on Zhodani worlds. Protective gear for hostile environments is widely available, although most likely owned by corporations, Intendants or Nobles, rather than Proles.

Trooper model combat armor is identical in function to the TL12 combat armor found on page 98 of the Traveller Core Rulebook.

### TELEPORTATION SUIT

This device can be worn as a form-hugging body-suit integrated or into a suit of armor. It rapidly cools or warms the body after teleportation, minimising damage from sudden energy gains or losses. The suit allows a Traveller to jump up to 600 meters up or down in a single teleport or up to 10 kilometers in a single hour when using successive jumps.

This is much like combat armor Zhodani troopers use but considerably lighter, substituting carbon-tube weave for the smart plastic of the Trooper armor. This is further enhanced with a specialized computer weave and communications system, with an installed Computer/3. This runs Intellect/1 and Expert (electronics (comms)) 2 software, assisting officers with unit coordination and control on the battlefield.

Guards combat armor is based on the earlier officer model (including the Computer/3) but has been further improved to enhance the psionic activity of the wearer. It combines a teleportation suit with special wiring patterns that provide psionic shielding for non-telepaths. Its glove palms can be removed to expose bare hands for psionic activity requiring physical contact.

Nobles in the Army and Guards wear this style of combat armor; based on the combat armor of the Guards, it offers improved protection without impairing movement. Noble combat armor is most distinguished by its broad cloak, made from deep black smart fabric. The armor also incorporates vislight chameleon technology, blending it into background scenery and making it extremely difficult to detect with the naked eye or optical instruments, granting the wearer DM+4 to Stealth checks. The workmanship on Noble combat armor is of very high quality, with special attention to finish and comfort.

## AUGMENTS

While augments are available in the Consulate, they are culturally frowned upon. Augments are seen as a sign of discomfort with how someone views themselves, a symptom of mental illness. However, recognizing that some augments have value (particularly to compensate for injuries), they are allowed – but all augments for Proles have psi-sensitive switches built into them, so they can be shut off by Intendants or Nobles if necessary. All augmentations listed in the _Traveller Core Rulebook_ and _Central Supply Catalogue_ up to TL14 are available in Zhodani space; however, requesting augmentations other than to replace lost limbs or injured functions will almost certainly result in re-education.

## MEDICAL SUPPLIES

Most medicines in the _Traveller Core Rulebook_ or _Central Supply Catalogue_ up to TL14 are available in the Consulate. The possession or use of anagathics within the Consulate is viewed as a symptom of mental illness, even for Nobles and items like inhibitor drugs are very restricted, although the Thought Police quietly makes use of them. They are not available on the open market. However, psi-drugs are widely available in the Consulate.

## ROBOTS

The Zhodani do not, as a rule, build humanoid or autonomous robots. The standard Zhodani mobile robot configuration is a legless torso containing computer, power plant and grav system. A number of arms, usually two, are attached, often with built-in tools or weapons. The robot is usually topped with a rotating head turret containing sensors and communication systems.

### A11/58231 TRASHBOT

This trashbot is commonly used by the Zhodani government and nobility. Wandering around a commercial or civic area, it continually picks up waste and stores it in a receptacle carried with it. When full, the robot dumps it at a local disposal location, then returns to trash patrol. The janitorial toolkit includes a collection of tools for sweeping, dusting, polishing and vacuuming, as well as static charge dissipaters and assorted mechanical cleaning aids. This toolkit also allows the robot to instantly shred most materials fed into it. This ability makes the robot ideal for information security applications and it can be found in many Zhodani government offices.

### A11/58231 MAINTENANCE BOT (TL12)

The maintenance bot has a cylindrical body with two arms each ending in complex tool-hands, and a small wedge-shaped head turret, and relies on its grav system for mobility. Manufactured by Chiadle, it is the most common general-purpose repair and maintenance robot used in Zhodani space. It can be seen at starports and aboard merchant or naval vessels, often negating the need for a dedicated maintenance crewman. It comes in various versions, mostly differing in the kind of tool systems used.

This warbot is light enough to be carried as equipment by a Zhodani commando team – massing a total of 9kg, a skilled teleporter can even carry one with him when he teleports. A favorite tactic of Zhodani commandos is to teleport deep into enemy territory, leave several light warbots behind and then teleport back to safety while the warbots wreak havoc on an unsuspecting enemy encampment, thoroughly demoralising the enemy.

## ZHODANI WARBOTS

The Zhodani traditionally use mobile robots as part of their armed forces. These robots are not sapient and form a cheap substitute for ordinary soldiers. Imperial propaganda paints the Zhodani use of 'death machines' as one more example of their soulless culture. The Zhodani have a different view; war is necessary but not glamorous and their soldiers' lives are too valuable to waste.

Warbots are normal parts of many Zhodani units and attached to others for special operations on a mission-by-mission basis. They are used in various ways, ranging from mass assault to mobile fire support platforms to providing security perimeters or post-battle pursuit. They are vital for clearing built-up areas, where casualties may be unacceptably high for troops. In such missions, they are normally sent to locations where clairvoyance-using psionic detachments have pinpointed enemy resistance. Against lower-tech forces, use is often made of their flight capabilities for surprise vertical envelopments.

Warbots are programmed to recognize and ignore friendly troops and are programmed with terrain maps, battle plans and threat criteria. They are all installed with transponders for battlefield 'friend or foe' recognition.

### MEDIUM WARBOT

This design is a popular warbot model, with customised versions in use throughout the Consulate. The warbot is solid and reliable, with good intelligence (as far as Zhodani robots go). The model shown here is a basic configuration but many other variations are available, depending on the operating environment or type of mission the warbot will be called upon to perform, carrying a variety of weapons, equipment and additional armor. Warbots intended for boarding actions often swap the laser rifle for a flamethrower.

### HEAVY WARBOT

This warbot is designed to hold its own in a full frontal assault involving armored troops with fusion and plasma weapons. Although hugely expensive, it stands up well in the most demanding battlefield situations. Besides the obvious offensive uses, it works well as a defensive warbot or forward scout, with its excellent sensors. The oblong half-dome chassis body presents a small frontal profile, thus minimising available targeting area, while the small rotating head contains the sensory and firing apparatus for the fusion weapon, allowing the main chassis body to remain behind cover while firing.

None

This is a medium-weight grav truck used by many civilian concerns within Zhodani space, as well as the military. The grav sled is noted for its ruggedness and safety in a wide range of planetary environments. It is sealed against water and vacuum, and durable enough to withstand collisions and incidental impacts.

## IMPERIOUS G-CARRIER

The Imperious is a good example of Zhodani light vehicle design philosophy: weaponry over armor. Sensors are less powerful than those in equivalent Imperial craft, presumably because the Zhodani place more stock in psionics as a supplement to sensors, rather than vice versa.

The Princely Lord Attack Speeder made its debut during the Fourth Frontier War. Despite its size, the speeder is a good example of the Zhodani military design philosophy of fast and deadly. However, the Princely Lord also has exceptionally good armor. This vehicle and its nearly identical cousin, the Silent Grasp, were responsible for more fear and panic among the Imperial populace in the Tloql sector than any other Zhodani fighting vehicle during the Fourth Frontier War.

The Silent Grasp Attack Speeder is visually similar to the Princely Lord but faster and has less armor. In addition, the Silent Grasp mounts twin fusion guns instead of an aerospace defence laser – a shorter ranged but more deadly weapon. The Silent Grasp looks so much like a Princely Lord that the two are often confused by civilians and military observers alike. Only with careful observation using dedicated sensors or close visual contact can the two craft be distinguished.

The Qiknavra (named after the smaller of Zhdant's continents) is one of the Consulate's latest grav tank designs. The craft is intended to be a small, relatively inexpensive, yet highly survivable vehicle on the battlefield. To date, the Imperium has been unable to determine the precise capabilities of the Qiknavra and, given its apparent ease of construction, its appearance has reignited fears of a new Frontier War.

EQUIPMENT

## HIGH GUARD: ZHODANI

Because the principles of physics and jump drive technology are constant throughout the universe, Zhodani starships are similar to the starships in use by other humans. The one major difference between Zhodani ships and those of other cultures is an abundance of psionic switches. Simple psionically sensitive switches are components of iris valves, automatic doors and many convenience items such as lights, temperature or environment controls and entertainment or communication devices.

## CIVILIAN STARSHIPS

It is customary for commercial shipping within the Consulate to travel unarmed; many commercial designs do away with weapons entirely. Ships intended for service in border regions, beyond the frontiers or in private hands, are more frequently armed. For this reason, crews for civilian designs almost never include dedicated gunners, even if the ship is armed.

## MILITARY STARSHIPS

Zhodani military starships are designed to be more general purpose in function than comparable Imperial vessels. While most Zhodani warships encountered on the frontiers are older TL13 designs, newer TL14 designs have been more common since the Fourth Frontier War.

Zhodani military starships often carry an additional crew member, a Counsellor, particularly on long voyages. While this person is generally a Thought Police member serving a term in the navy, they are responsible for the mental health of the crew and report to the captain of the ship, not the Thought Police hierarchy.

## NINZ-CLASS SCOUT

A standard civilian exploratory vessel used by both commercial concerns and the Consulate Navy for frontier exploration and reconnaissance. An old and reliable design, this scout is oriented more towards survey and scientific missions and less to courier-type duties than its Imperial counterpart is. Ninz-class scouts see extensive use for supplemental surveys off the main axis of exploration within the Core Expeditions. Ships in naval service are named after former naval officers.

## YETSASL-CLASS COURIER

The Yetsasl-class is named after a racing beast on Zhdant and individual ships often after similar creatures on other worlds. The courier design gives priority to transport of important personnel, such as government officials on diplomatic missions. The Yetsasl's role often takes it outside the Consulate and it is the Zhodani vessel most commonly encountered in the Imperium. Yetsasls are a separate design from Ninz scouts, unlike the Imperial practice of using the same hull for both scouts and couriers; a Yetsasl is larger than a Ninz and contains more extensive staterooms and fittings.

## ZDEBR-CLASS TRADER

Individuals and small trading companies are the most prolific operators Zdebr-class traders and these ships are a common sight in frontier regions of the Consulate. They are more general-purpose vessels than the 400-ton subsidized merchant used in the Imperium, being closer in concept to an oversized free trader. Atypically for a Zhodani commercial vessel the Zdebr is armed, albeit lightly. Zdebr-class ships are named after historically famous seaports and caravan routes on old Zhdant.

## SHIANJO-CLASS LINER

A passenger liner used in the core regions of the Consulate and along most of its main trade routes, the Shianjo ('Good Journey') has a reputation for its stylish interior design and high jump range. Nobles and Intendants typically occupy staterooms, while Proles travel in low passage unless they are servants or retainers. Commercial vessels are normally unarmed in peaceful Consulate space but in wartime this makes them easy targets for privateers and commerce raiders, forcing the Zhodani navy to provide escorts.

Supreme council members and their agents on Consular business use these fast, highly advanced ships. Interior fittings are notably luxurious, but they are unusual as they carry a second starship internally – a 200 ton Yetsasl courier, used for side-trips or ensuring the safety of the Consul on board should the corvette come under attack.
