At the apex of the [[Khiinra Ash]]’s life forms are the Bhu’oovaakaylaa, an immense species that defies strict definition. The species has two sexes, each of which weigh about four tons with females slightly larger than males. They bear live young, usually in litters of two or three, which are immediately mobile upon birth. Bhu’oovaakaylaa have a thick, elongated body with rear flippers for swimming, an armored carapace on their dorsal surface like that of a crustacean, two dextrous appendages that end in three fingers with an opposable thumb and a head- like structure at the front. The head has four eyes that wrap most of the way around it to provide 270o vision. The species is omnivorous with a large mouth that contains a dozen large molar-like teeth to masticate plant food and sharp incisors in the front to bite off chunks of meat from animals. The Bhu’oovaakaylaa have an internal bladder with which they extract gaseous elements from the atmosphere for various purposes. When filled, the bladder enables them to float short distances.

The Bhu’oovaakaylaa are classified as a Minor Race with human-level intelligence. They are currently at approximately TL2 with some tool manufacturing that extend to TL3. They are by and large a friendly species and were initially contacted by Vilani scouts thousands of years ago. The worldwide population of the Bhu’oovaakaylaa is difficult to determine but the Scout Services estimates that there are probably about 12 million of them. The listed population figure for the world represents only the humans present.
