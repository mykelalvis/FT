> [!info]- Referee's Note
> Jessica is secretly a member of the [[Liberation Front]] but she is not part of any particular cell. She frequently smuggles goods for their cause but does not get directly involved in demonstrations to avoid drawing attention to her position.

> [!info]- Referee's Note
> If the players question Jessica Nash, she will repeat her speech about independence and free speech. However, if she is interrogated, Jessica will eventually reveal that she is a [[Zhodani]] agent. She does not know the details of any [[Zhodani]] operations, her mission is simply to encourage dissidents to destabilize the [[Imperium]] in the Jewell subsector.
