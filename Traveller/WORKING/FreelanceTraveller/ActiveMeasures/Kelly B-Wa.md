Kelly is a short, attractive woman with jet-black hair cut short. She dresses in surplus IISS coveralls, with ship patches on both shoulders for the Crimson Folly, the Free Trader she has acquired. Over 28 years, she has worked her way up to ownership of the Folly, taking her lumps along the way. She is glad to finally have something of her own to show for her efforts, and will do what she can to keep the Folly flying, with her on board and in charge. When speaking of the Folly, her face lights up, and one might believe her to be about to giggle. Clearly, she loves her Folly, and considers it her pride and joy.

When the PCs encounter her, however, she will look badly stressed, with a pinched look and deep bags under her eyes. She walks or sits hunched in on herself, smokes furtively, and is on a few different medications for stress. A few minutes conversation will reveal that death, thievery, and incompetence have brought her to the point where she has an un-crewed ship, and no means to make next month's payment (which is due in 3 weeks).  Much of this is due to [[Gerald Goodepaster|Gerbil]].

Kelly has no family to speak of. Her mother passed away on Ruie almost a decade ago, and her older brother never survived his first term in the Scouts. Despite a generally crestfallen look, Kelly is sharp as a tack; from an enlisted cargo hand, she worked her way up, often with the benefit of correspondence courses, through all the ranks to Captain. In fact, she has a graduate degree in Astrogation, though that never translated into any commercial opportunity; the practicalities always fell towards taking care of the ship she was on, and the Free Traders rarely used navigators let alone paid extra for one. She still makes it a habit, however, to always personally lay in the best course for the Folly.

Kelly tries to melt away from any physical violence, but she is not squeamish. She carries her dagger in a boot sheath, and her body pistol in a discreet torso rig; both essentially disappear in the folds of the coveralls she wears. In the few times that Kelly has resorted to deadly force to get out of scrapes, it has been without warning or attendant drama, and therefore as a complete surprise. Kelly feels that is how death comes out in the black, and sometimes one must quietly help it choose another subject.
