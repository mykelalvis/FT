# Introduction

This booklet contains two comprehensive adventures for Traveller printed back-to-back. Each adventure is complete and independent. This adventure, titled Annie Nova, deals with a derelict starship encountered orbiting a small gas giant in the Keng stellar system.

It is assumed that this adventure will be administered by a referee who has read through this adventure, and who is familiar with both it and the rules for Traveller. This situation calls for only the basic Requires only Traveller booklets (Books 1, 2, and 3), and no additional Basic Traveller supplements, books, or other information. As usual, paper, pencils, six-sided dice, and square-grid graph paper will prove necessary during the course of the adventure.

## Standards and Assumptions

The following standards and assumptions are used in the text of this adventure.
The referee may alter them as necessary to correspond to a local situation.

### Dates

All dates herein correspond to the Imperial calendar. The date for this situation is sometime in 1105; that is, sometime in the 1105th year following the founding of the lmperium. The referee should indicate the exact date based on the local situation. Once the adventure starts, time should flow normally.

### Place

This adventure takes place in the [[Regina subsector]] within the [[Spinward Marches]] of the [[lmperium]], in space near a small gas giant in a stellar system with only one significant inhabited planet- [[Keng]] (0805-E2718CA-3). The Keng system has two gas giants, a large one much closer to the primary, and the small one very far out. As a result, starship traffic to the small gas giant is minimal, and there is little chance that anyone would normally be anywhere near it.  Keng, of interest only because it is the nearest habitable world, is a small world with a high population and a charismatic oligarchic government.

## Using This Adventure

The referee can use this adventure as an independent situation with pregenerated  characters (as written), or may use it with continuing characters from an existing campaign. Changes necessary for an existing campaign should be both simple and obvious.

REFEREE'S CHECKLIST

1. Assign characters.
2. Allow equipment purchase.
3. State situation.
4. Guide characters through situation based on their actions.

Referee's Checklist: The steps shown in the referee's checklist should guide the referee through the elements of administering this adventure. Characters are covered next in this section, as is equipment purchase. [[#The situation]] is stated, with additional materials contained in the remainder of the adventure.

### Characters

This adventure is intended for a band of adventurers numbering at least two and no more than eight. A group of pre-generated characters is supplied below, although the referee may allow other individuals instead.

|  #  | Character                         |   UPP  | Age | Terms | Money  |                                    Skills                                    | Possessions |

A skill level of 0 (for example, Vacc-0) has been assigned to show some familiarity with a skill, sufficient to allow use, but no expertise.

A skill level of 0 (for example, vacc-0) has been assigned to show some familiarity with a skill, sufficient to allow use, but no real expertise. A skill level of 0 with a gun (for example, carbine-0) shows the preferred, or best, weapon for an individual otherwise without weapon skill.

### Equipment

Referees using an on-going campaign should ignore the remainder of this section, with the possible exception of the [[#Available Equipment Table]].

Characters should review their equipment, and may purchase more. However, it is essential that one of the characters be the merchant captain (character number1 ), because he provides the ship which serves as transport for the adventurers. The merchant captain has possession of a far trader, the Empress Nicholle (a type A2, 200 tons).It's ship's locker contains the equipment loaded shown on the table. Before the char-acters are told the details of the ad-venture, they should be allowed to purchase any other equipment they feel will be necessary or desirable. Any equipment available may be purchased,subject to the following restrictions:

1. It must be described in Books 1 or 3 of Traveller or on the [[#Available Equipment Table]]. Items from other Traveller materials are not available.
2. The price indicated must be paid. Since the only assets available to the characters are the credit balances above, some items (battle dress, for example) are precluded because of expense.

> [!Info]- Merchant Ship Equipment
> The _Empress Nicholle_ is a type A2 far trader, 200 tons, now fifty years old and finally without a mortgage.
> It has six staterooms and four low berths; cargo capacity is 61 tons.

## Referee's Note

The information in this adventure is intended for the use of the referee. Only specific items of information should be made available to the players.

1. [[Annic Nova#Introduction|Introductory Material]] should be made available to the players through the referee, rather than allowing them to read it directly. Traveller's Advisory: [[AnnicNova- ship.jpg|The illustration]] and [[#Travellers' Aid Society Advisory Report 02-183-1105|advisory report]] should be shown to the players, and should be available for reference throughout the adventure.
2. [[#Aboard The Starship]] deals with the interior features of the ship, and with its details.  It is for the referee alone, and becomes divulged only through the course of the adventure.
3. [[#Referee's Notes]] are concerned with the starship Annic Nova, and are for the use of the referee alone.
4. Library Data: A variety of information is provided in the [[#Library Data]] section; it should become available when adventurers consult data files.

# The Situation

## Travellers' Aid Society Advisory Report 02-183-1105

![[AnnicNova- ship.jpg|100]]
[[AnnicNova- ship.jpg|Link]]

Reports received from the [[Regina Subsector]] in the [[The Spinward Marches]] tell of an unidentified starship of markedly unorthodox design which has been making use of unauthorized transmission frequencies.

Originally sighted in [[IY1103]], the ship immediately came to Imperial attention by standing off [[Heya]] (0802-8687745-A) and transmitting on a restricted military band. Interceptors scrambled immediately, but the ship jumped outsystem while the fighters were at extreme range.

Later reports have placed the ship at [[Kinorb]] (0602-A663659-5) where it stood off for nearly five weeks without any contact, then jumped. The lack of local bases or traffic made interception impossible. Last known contact took place off [[Dentus]] (0601-C979500-A) where the local scout base immediately set five Type S scouts on contact duty. Although the unknown immediately jumped, some basic data was recovered from scanners. Reports of additional sightings should be forwarded to the local Travellers' Aid Society for central consolidation.

# Aboard The Starship

This derelict starship stands as an obvious object for investigation. Once it is boarded, checked out, and fully understood, it promises to be a useful starship for nearly any type of adventurer. The ship appears to be in good condition, and can probably be made functional in a reasonably short period of time.

##### Entry Points

The computer supervised scan of the starship indicates several obvious (and not
so obvious) entry points. After some deliberation, the group of adventurers must
select one and enter the ship.

1. The keel-like structure projecting from the bottom of the ship is the furthest extension of the central communications and access shaft which connects the four lowermost decks. At its very lowest point, an operational iris valve is located; it opens to reveal a small interior chamber which is obviously an air lock. Safety interconnects prevent the inner iris valve from operating unless the outer valve is closed.
2. At the top center front of the ship is a transparent astrogation dome with a bearing race along the front half of its circumference. Mounted on the race is an electro-mechanical sextant connected to the computer; whenever the ship's power is on, this sextant is in constant motion. Smashing this dome will allow access to the interior, to a vertical shaft leading down through the cargo deck (but not opening onto it) and to the quarters deck. The quarters deck will be rendered airless by this action.
3. At the very rear of the lower decks is an arched indentation with a single sliding panel. Forcing the panel open will allow access to the cargo bay, although decompressing it in the process.
4. The transparent observation dome at the extreme rear of the ship covers a cantilever platform holding four fixed chairs and a small control panel mounted on a vertical column. The dome is light-sensitive, and turns opaque when subjected to any strong light (such as a spotlight), slowly returning to transparency after the light is turned off. The dome may be broken or shattered, allowing entrance at the cost of decompressing the entire engineering deck.
5. The shafts leading from the rear hub to the pods each have hatches toward the pod ends; these hatches lead to small air locks. The port hatch is locked on a throw of 4, 5, or 6. The starboard hatch is jammed shut, with marks indicating the after-effects of a minor collision. Forcing this hatch open is a mechanical problem, and can be resolved by mechanical-1 skill.

Simplistic solutions to the entry problem (such as cutting through the hull, or blasting the ship with laser fire) should be discouraged, either by the referee or through the ship's computer. The time spent determining which manner of entry to be used should be reasonably limited to perhaps ten minutes.

##### Exterior Features

![[AN-Numerical Equivalent Chart (Chart 1).jpg]]
As the starship is reconnoitered from afar, instruments indicate no transmissions from the ship. As the adventurers move closer°, sensors produce an image of the ship, but it is showing no lights, with the exception of low level red showing through the forward lower bank of windows. There is no sign of life or activity. Still closer, painted markings on the exterior of the starship become visible. A string of characters is placed on each of the pods to the rear, and on the top of the shaft leading aft to the hub. The characters are not anglic, being geometric in form, but an approximation of them would read (roughly) ANNIC NOV A. The port pod is marked ANNIC NOVA I, and the starboard pod is marked ANN IC NOV A V. The markings are actually numerals, although this should not be apparent to the adventurers.

The Numeral Chart shows the actual numeral represented (column 1 ), the symbol painted on the ship (column 2), and an approximation of a similar anglic letter (column 3). Note that in addition to a zero, there is a distinct symbol for the double zero. Any player who determines, in the course of play, that they are indeed numerals (including the double zero symbol), has demonstrated that he or she has a comprehension of the ship to at least a limited extent, and is allowed a DM of +1 thereafter when attempting to understand other aspects of the ship.

## Interior Features

See [[#Deck Plans]]

The starship interior is initially dark, and its intruders will be in vacc suits. The following information should be used by the referee as he or she administers the interior.

### Power

The ship is at low power, sufficient only for standby lighting on the bridge, and for emergency operation of the iris valves within. All locations are at zero-G. The starship is dark, and individuals will find their actions doubly clumsy- from zero-G and from their encumbering vacc suits.

A prominent power-on switch is situated on the bridge; and another is on the cantilever platform at the rear which will turn power on (but cannot turn power off). Power-on puts all interior lights on and activates the grav plates. When the grav plates go on, any individual not specifically stating that he or she is standing with feet on the floor, or sitting in a chair, is subject to a fall. Each throws 8+ to avoid an injurious fall; DM +2 if dexterity 8+, +1 if strength 10+, - vacc suit skill. If the fall occurs, the individual receives 20 hits.

### Atmosphere

The interior of the ship is fully pressurized, and an atmosphere tester will indicate breathable gases; there is no apparent (or real) danger of losing pressure. Fracture of domes, or other decompression activity will render a specific area in vacuum; its extent can be traced on the diagrams. Iris valves will automatically close to limit this effect whenever possible.

Vacc suit discipline should be broken as soon as possible, either by reassuring the adventurers that there appears to be no danger, or emphasizing the clumsiness of the vacc suits. Apply a DM -2 on weapon use by individuals without vacc suit skill, and reduce personal dexterity by -2. In addition, the ship is oriented to the small stature of the original crew, and passage through iris valves in vacc suit runs the danger of ripping the suit (throw 8+ to rip; OM+ vacc suit skill).

### Temperature

The interior temperature of the ship is about 25 degrees C.

### Iris Valves

Automatic, airtight doorways are installed in bulkhead throughout the ship. These portals open and shut much like the shutter of a camera; they do not swing. Valves are difficult to force once fully closed (throw 9+ to open a closed iris valve; DM +1 if strength 10+, +2 if dexterity 10+, -3 if in vacc suit). Gunfire will simply lock a valve tighter. Valves are impossible to force if open. Any strong object (metal bar or rod) placed in the valve when open will prevent full closure, and allow a partially closed valve to be opened with ease. Iris valves are operated by pressing a stud on the wall near the valve. As long as the ship has any power (the power accumulators have not actually been disconnected at the source), iris valves will function automatically if pressure drops.

### Hatches

Hinged solid airtight doors are mounted in some locations. These portals function manually.

### Doors

Any doorway not a valve or hatch is a sliding door. Such are not airtight (and easily visible as such), and open at the touch of a stud on the wall. If locked (all locks are controlled by the computer, even at low power), the door will not open unless broken down, shot open, or pried open with a prybar (all rather easy tasks, as the doors are not too substantial).

## Within The Starship

[[#Deck Plans]] map of the interior of the starship, and all explanatory text is coded to these diagrams. The adventurers' seemingly purposeless search will gradually enhance their knowledge of the interior features of the ship, and help in their growing understanding.

## Central Access Shaft

Leading directly through the bottom four decks, this shaft has iris valves at each level. Running parallel is a lift which can carry up to three persons at once, operated by a simple control button set marked (in ship's numerals), I, V, 7, and A.
At the rear of the shaft is a ladder which can be used in lieu of the lift. The iris valves in the shaft maintain airtight integrity, so that loss of pressure on any deck will not be transmitted past any closed valve. Each level has one iris valve, facing forward, with the exception of level 7, which has three valves, facing forward, port, and starboard.

## Bridge Deck (Locations 1 - 5)

Painted on the iris valve at this level is the figure I. The valve opens into a short corridor which further opens into room 1.

1. Large Room. The control room is a spacious area containing a long control panel against the forward wall under a row of windows. Five acceleration couches are centered in the area, two to each flank, and on, slightly raised, on the centerline of the ship, obviously for the pilot or captain. The controls for the bridge are arranged in a reasonably straightforward manner, and readouts can be puzzled out by any pilot or navigator with intelligence of 8+ in a matter of hours; the power-on control is obvious to anyone. There is no evidence of maneuver controls or readouts whatever; only a dual set of jump controls.
2. Computer Room. Nearly all of the available space in this room is taken up by computer equipment of large bulk, and requiring heavy cooling arrangements. A maintenance console for the computer is present in this room, but five other consoles similar in construction are installed on the bridge control panel.
3. Office. This room contains a desk, a computer terminal, and several drawers of papers covered with indecipherable symbols.
4. Ready Room. This room contains a pair of bunks (clean and made-up), and simple toilet facilities.
5. Avionics Room. This room is filled with a wide variety of detection and communication instruments. Individuals with electronics-1 or better will recognize each of the following on a throw of 7+: long range detectors, long range communications equipment, short range scanners, and deep radar.

## Quarters Deck (Locations 6 -19)

Painted on the iris valve at this level is the figure V,

6. Living Area. This lounge is spacious and carpeted, and several comfortable  chairs are scattered about around small tables. On the wall to starboard is a bar, while to port is a floor-to-ceiling visor screen. Each side wall has a hallway leading off laterally. The bar is well stocked with liquors, most having indecipherable labels. A close check (to take perhaps 15 minutes) will reveal at least one bottle labelled in anglic, and a date about 20 years ago. The quality of the liquors is excellent (by reputation to a connoiseur, and by taste if tasted). If this deck has been rendered airless, all the bottles will be broken, and the contents spilled and evaporated. The visor screen responds to the controls (on-off) on the wall next to it, or will come on (with sound at full volume) if someone sits down in the lounge chair directly facing it. The program shown is (throw 1D)
   1. an animated film with a great deal of violence, but no apparent injuries,
   2. an abstract color projection with an accompanying soothing music soundtrack
   3. a head and shoulders view of a bald, eyebrowless, humanoid talking in an unknown language while graphic maps projected behind him constantly change,
   4. an apparent travelogue showing a variety of animals in their natural habitats
   5. an animated lecture on the chemical elements, with accompanying text and voice-over
   6. static.

Close investigation of the visor will show a concealed set of controls (in a sliding panel on the wall), including a volume control, a channel dial marked `IV7 AJU`, and a speed control. The channel control will select among the six channels indicated. The speed control will slow down or speed up the program being shown; if channel 6 (U) is slowed down, it becomes a children's illustrated dictionary. Studying channel U or channel J will teach the ship's language (studying 12 hours per day) on a throw of 14+, OM +1 per day spent, OM +1 if intelligence 11+. ^area6

7. Sleeping Room. This small room is obviously sleeping quarters, and contains a bunk, fold-out desk, several drawers, mirror, and reclining chair. There are, however, no clothing, and no sign of personal articles. ^room-7

8. Sleeping Room. This small room is similar to [[#^room-7|room 7]], but has a lived-in look. In the top drawer is a box containing several rings mounted with gemstones (each with an apparent value of Cr500). Under the bunk's matress is an envelope containing several bills (apparently money), marked JO, IN, and INO, as well as various statements and phrases in the ship's language. A full length mirror is mounted on the wall. If power is on low level, it is indeed a mirror. If power is on full, the mirror is an operating color retransmitter screen, which means that it acts like a mirror, but presents an unreversed image. A person standing in front of it would see himself or herself as others do, rather than as a mirror image. Unless someone actually stands in front of the mirror  nd indicates that he or she is checking it out, the effect will be than anyone in the room will have an undefined, uneasy feeling. The mechanism for the retransmitter is behind the screen, accessible if a concealed latch is located and tripped. ^room-8

9. Sleeping Room. This room is larger, and contains a double bed rather than bunks. Personal effects for both male and female individuals are present in the drawers. ^room-9

10. Bedroom. In this room, the most obvious feature is the presence of the four small beds along the walls. Several small pieces of furniture are scattered about, and a lot of clothing is strewn in disorder. Aside from a few small toys, there is nothing of value here. However, after all have left the lateral hallway, a small robot-like device (about 300mm high, cylindrical, and emitting small peeping noises while an electric blue spark wanders around its head/top) will emerge. It will orient on one person, and follow him/her around anywhere on this deck, the sparks getting more violent whenver it approaches closer than one meter. This device is actually a child's toy, easily broken by a kick or blow; it can be turned off by touching it with an ungloved hand, and will turn on again at the next touch.

11. Bathroom. This small room contains toilet facilities and a shower.

12. Probably a Bedroom. The interior of this room has been charred black, as if by flame (possibly by a plasma gun). Nothing remains of its original furnishings.

13. Bedroom. This room is much like [[#^room-8|room 8]], but the full length mirror is cracked. If the latch (concealed) is found, the the area behind the mirror is found to be empty, the retransmitter having been removed. The area is now used for storage, and contains several cartons of books with garish covers. In addition, a map box with a chip installed for a specific world ([[Victoria]], located in the [[Lanth Subsector]] in the [[The Spinward Marches]]).

![[AN-50Diagram3.jpg]]

14. Bedroom. This room is much like [[#^room-9|room 9]], but contains two bunks rather than the double bed. Aside from ordinary articles of clothing, the only items of interest are an instant print camera, and a battery powered typewriter. Close examination of the typewriter reveals that it can be used as a remote (up to 500km distant) terminal for the ship's computer.
15. Locked Bedroom Door. Taped to the door is a crayon drawing (as if by a child) of a coiled snake. When the door is forced, a terribly foul odor and considerable quantities of dust roil from the room. Inside are four dead bodies, three adults and one child, all exhibiting considerable corruption. In addition, dirty linen is piled in the corners of the rooms, and the floor is filthy. Breathing the unfiltered air of the room exposes an individual to an extreme chance of infection. The dust will slowly spread to the entire deck (within ten minutes). after which anyone on the deck is subject to a strong chance of infection. If an iris valve is opened to another level, that level becomes a possible source of contamination (with a low chance of infection). The effects of this disease are covered [[#The Disease|here]].
16. Bathroom. This small room contains toilet facilities and a shower.
17. Kitchen or Galley. This area is studded with tables and chairs, between kitchen facilities along the lateral walls. The tables and chairs are collapsible, and the kitchen areas have sliding screens which can be used to conceal and protect them. The floor of this area is uncarpeted, and bears markings similar to that of a basketball court, obviously for some sort of game. This concept is furthered by the contents of one drawer in the kitchen area: several resilient balls and some handball gloves. A remote control switch in the drawer will turn off (and on) the grav plates in the galley/kitchen area.
18. Maintenance Area. Behind the cold box (it swivels out) on the port side is a maintenance area filled with life support systems, such as main temperature and air circulation ducts.
19. Pantry. Behind the cold box on the starboard side is a pantry stocked with canned and preserved foods, including many delicacies. Much of the food is from commercial preparers, and can be identified as edible.
20.

CARGO DECK (Locations 20-27)
This deck has three iris valves in the central access shaft; they lead starboard, forward, and port. Each is marked with a 7.

20. Forward Cargo Area. A large chamber nearly 20 meters wide and 9 meters deep. Well lit, it is empty except for a few empty crates in one corner and a bale of vegetable leaves near the iris valve. Closer investigation will reveal that the material is tobacco, which is a rarity in this part of the lmperium. It will sell for Cr20, for its full 50kg) if sold in the seedier parts of a starport town; it is also probably illegal on any world with a law level 8+.

21. Corridor. This passageway leads to port and makes a right angle bend aft, where it is then blocked by massive steel doors. Before the bend, large cargo doors open fore and aft into cargo areas; scratch and scuff marks indicate that cargo has been dragged across the corridor many times. A set of wall studs near these doors  will open them; however, a red button is also present-it turns off (and on) the grav plates on this deck to allow easier handling of cargo. The steels door at the end of the corridor is part of a cylinder set within a larger cylinder, It will not open without instructions from the main computer (a computer terminal is located on th wall next to each door). If some one attempts to force the door (or incorrect computer instructions are entered more than 3 times in a ten minute period), and power is on, an outlet valve will open, bleeding the air from this deck within thirty seconds. In any case, the door is nearly 200mm thick, and will require a long time to burn through (approximately 20000 hits administered by energy weapon, such as a laser, or by a cutting torch). If the door is opened by computer instruction, the entire inner ring of the turret rotates to match a door opening with the doorway in the outer turret ring.

22. Corridor. This passageway leads to starboard, and makes a right angle bend aft. It is treated in a manner similar to location 21.

23. Lower Turret Area. Beyond the steel doorway is a large crowded area filled with the mechanical and electronic apparatus which comprises the turret mechanism. A ladder leads upward into the ceiling.

24. Lower Turret Area. This location is similar to location 23.

25. Aft Cargo Area. This area is an irregularly shaped cargo bay, marked by an arched protrusion in its center, and bulges in the lateral walls. The arched protrusion is fitted with a sturdy sliding door, which will not open if there is air pressure in the cargo bay (unless, of course, it is forced, or a pinnace is in position on the other side of the door). This siding door serves as a loading dock for pinnaces. There is a mechanism which will magnetically lock a pinnace in position against the doors. Halfway back in the rear area, along the side walls, are sets of cabinets. The port cabinet has three vacc suits of unusual design. If they are tried on, they are found to be personalized, and non-adjustable, with only a slight chance that they will fit the individual involved (throw 10+ for the suit to fit; DM +1 if the individual is strength-5 or less, because they are on the small side). The suits are unusual in that an oxygen regeneration system is built into the fabric, rather than being contained in a separate pack. If the suit doesn't fit, however, altering it will render it useless. Each suit may be assumed to have a value of about Cr40000 to someone whom it will fit.

26. Gun Turret. At the top of the ladder leading from location 23, a small area contains a gunner's couch near a laser cannon tube. The couch will comfortably fit only for persons of small stature (assume a strength of 6 or less). The laser cannon is operated and fired from this position.

27. Gun Turret. At the top of the ladder leading from location 24, a small area contains a gunners couch near a laser cannon tube. This area is similar to location 26, and should be administered like it.

## Engineering Deck (Locations 28 - 31)

The iris valve on this level is marked with the numeral A.

28. Machine Shop. This area is relatively small, and filled to forward with machine tools, a workbench, and cabinets filled with a great many spare parts in paper cartons. To the port and starboard are large (floor to ceiling) gratings with radiator flanges behind them.

29. Metallurgical Shop. This small room contains facilities for detailled small scale metal work, from one gram to ten kilograms, and can be used to produce such diverse items as jewellery, gun parts, and mechanical spares. Such a shop is quite usable by a person with mechanical-2 or better.

30. Electronic Shop. This area is similar to location 29, but designed for electronics repairs. While this shop cannot create small electronics components, it does have a large supply of such parts, which can be identified through the shipboard computer. This shop is usable by a person with electronic-2 or better.

31. Gangway. Sloping at an angle upward, this corridor leads to the next deck.

## Drive Deck (Locations 32-42)

This deck is accessed within the ship only through the gangway leading from the Engineering Deck.

32. Hydroponics Area. This entire area is overgrown with plants. An iris valve is obvious aft, but the two corridors leading forward are not, being concealed by the extensive growth. Overhead, the area is roofed by transparent sloping ceiling panels, and banks of lights. The vegetation is covered with thorns, but is not especially dangerous unless a person were to actually fall into a group of plants, in which case about 1D hits would be inflicted.
33. Forward Control Area. A complete set of jump controls are installed at this point, including a computer terminal. If these controls are tampered with, the drive chargers will be set in operation. A humming will begin, and observers in the astrogation dome, the hydroponics area, and in ships outside, will note that the canopy is unfolding. After an hour, the process will be completed, revealing a skeleton framework and a circular thin black radiation-absorbent film about 1 kilometer in diameter. Stopping the process is impossible without computer assistance, but the canopy will refold itself when the accumulators are recharged, a period of 1D weeks. The twin corridors leading from location 32 to 33 are generally featureless, with single passageways leading port and starboard. The central area between the two corridors is a solid area containing a complex set of electronics parts, and several solid silver buss bars. Electronics-2 or better will deduce that this is the accumulator section of the starship power supply: When fully charged, there is a distinct odor of ozone in the air. Power cable connections (about 300mm in diameter, and insulated) rise from the accumulators and pass into the ceiling panels.
34. Jump-2 Pod. This engineering area contains a jump drive mechanism for the ship, and outwardly appears to be identical with the mechanism on the other side of the ship. An individual with engineering-3 or better will see that this drive is capable of jump-2.
35. Jump-3 Pod. This area is similar to location 34, and is administered in a similar manner. However, this equipment is capable of jump-3.
36. Air Lock. The iris valve at the aft end of the hydroponics area opens into an air lock. The valve itself is in a nearly closed position, but held open by a scratched and corroded metal rod wedged in place apparently by accident. Beyond the valve is a short corridor leading to another iris valve held open by a similar metal rod. Along the corridor, the attraction of the grav plates (assuming they are on) gradually diminishes from full (at the forward end) to zero (at the aft end).
37. Cabinet. Concealed behind a bulkhead to port, accessible from [[#^location-39|location 39]],  is a cabinet, with a concealed switch behind the upholstery on the wall. The cabinet itself contains a transmitter/receiver, with audio, video, and telemetry capability.
38. Cabinet. This cabinet is similar to location 37, but contains miniaturized  communicators keyed to the equipment in location 37. These devices may be carried in world surface exploration, and used to communicate with personnel aboard ship. Access to the ship's computer will reveal (when asked) that there are also several remote missiles fitted with audio, visual, and telemetric devices. The missiles are launched by computer from exterior racks in the hub area; each is a responsive discretionary missile of 12G12. There are four, each of which is reusable.
39. Lounge Area. This area is finished with a fur-like carpeting on floor, ceiling, and walls. Concealed panels in the forward bulkhead contain cabinets which are locations 37, and 38. This area is in zero-G. ^location-39
40. Observation Deck. This area is covered by a transparent observation dome facing aft, and contains a cantilevered platform with four fixed chairs and a small control panel. It is finished in the same style as location 39, and is in zero-G.
41. Lateral Shaft. This corridor slants upward at an angle and ends in a hatch. Beyond the hatch is another, plus another hatch leading out of the tube. It is in zero-G.
42. Lateral Shaft. This tube is similar to location 41. ^location-42

## The Pinnaces (Locations 43 - 50)

The two trailing pods visible at the ends of the shafts connected to the hub on the Drive Deck appear to be maneuver drive pods from a distance, but are actually 40 ton pinnaces. Normally transported in this position, they are detachable, and may be used for errands or missions. These small craft are laid out in opposite handedness, and will only attach on their proper shafts. Each is streamlined, and has fuel skimmers (for refuelling at a gas giant), and has provision for fuel transfer. Each also has a cable connection which automatically mates with ship power connections when in docking position.

43. Pinnace Controls. This area contains standard design controls usable by an individual with ship's boat skill. With seating for two, the port seat also has aiming and firing controls for the single pulse laser mounted on the boat.
44. Pinnace Controls. This area is similar to [[#^location-42|location 42]].
45. Pinnace Cargo Bay. The port pinnace is a cargo boat, and can carry bulk cargo totalling 12 tons. Collapsible seating can fill the area and carry up to 16 passengers instead. A large sliding cargo door is visible in the exterior bulkhead.
46. Pinnace Passenger Area. The starboard pinnace is a passenger vessel, with four half-sized staterooms complete with bunks and storage areas. This pinnace could carry up to five persons on relatively long (30 day) flightswith only minimal discomfort. There is no provision for cargo, although conceivably about two tons could be crammed into the central aisle.
47. Bathroom. This area contains toilet facilities and a shower.
48. Bathroom. This area contains toilet facilities and a shower.
49. Drive Room. The maneuver drives for this pinnace are contained in this area.
50. Drive Room. The maneuver drives for this pinnace are contained in this area.

# Referee's Notes

The following should enhance the referee's understanding of the Annie Nova.

## The Computer

Location 2 on the Bridge Deck contains the starship's central computer. Its programming language is unknown to the explorers, and the computer will not initially respond (assuming power is turned on). An individual with computer-2 can install a standard programming language from another source in about a day.

Someone with computer-4 can instead decipher the computer's language, altering it to respond to normal procedures; throw 12+, DM +1 per level of computer skill, once per week of trying. Once the computer is reprogrammed, it will be found to have the software list shown.
The computer is a non-standard device equivalent to a Model/3, but massing considerably more (in the range of 15 tons).

One feature of the computer is its graphics package, which can superimpose data on the forward window wall, making an immediate evaluation of a situation possible at a glance. For example, the computer can lay a three dimensional grid on the window wall, and then spotlight or code all objects present, showing their relation to the ship. It can then project and show trajectories or possible courses. A functioning computer will respond to keyword input, and reply with appropriate data. The referee may wish to limit random guessing at keywords by players, and may institute limits, or dispense clues, The following keywords are especially important.

### Maneuver, Acceleration, or Evasion

One or both of the pinnaces may be swiveled under computer control, and thrust may be applied by their engines. Such manipulation will alter the orientation of the ship, allowing the guns to be brought to bear, or the observation deck pointed as desired. Instructions are simply keyed into the computer.
For travel to any great distance, a pinnace must be physically moved (using pilot or ship's boat skill) to the rear of the cargo bay (location 25) and magnetically moored. Computer instruction for long distance maneuver is then entered, and up to one-tenth G thrust applied. Each pinnace is capable of ten minutes thrust for each ton of fuel burned.

### Fuel, Refuel, or Power

The canopy collects radiated stellar power and stores it in the accumulators on the drive deck. The only way to extend the canopy is with the controls on the drive deck or the control panel in the observation dome. It cannot be controlled from the bridge.
The accumulators can store enough energy to power each jump drive once, as well as maintain internal life support under normal conditions.
_Duration of internal power_: 60 days under ordinary load.
_Required recharge time_: 1 to six weeks (1 D), depending on the distance from, and spectral type of the star serving as the radiation source.
_Weapons_: The two laser cannon turrets are used as laser +1, the guns being quite effective in fire control.

## The Disease

The disease from location 15 is transmitted via an airborne virus with a long dormancy period. No symptoms will become apparent for at least one week. At that point, each person who has been exposed must roll for infection on the [[#disease table]], once, at the highest possible level. DM -1 for strength 10+ DM -1 for any person with service in the scout service (for the scout service immunizations). A doctor who has analyzed the situation may prescribe ; strict rest and sleep; following this regimen allows a DM -4.  Low passage or drugs may slow the onset of the disease, but there are no specific drugs or universal cures which will automatically counteract this disease.
Prevention: Any medic-3 (doctor) or better will know from his training and experience that infection from this virus can probably be lessened greatly by strict rest and sleep. Following such a prescription would preclude any physical or mental effort, including any use of skills, or any work.

DISEASE TABLE

| Individual's Endurance | Low | Strong | Extreme |
| :--------------------: | :-: | :----: | :-----: |
|        4 or less       |  8+ |   7+   |    2+   |
|          5, 6          |  9+ |   8+   |    4+   |
|          7, 8          | 10+ |   9+   |    6+   |
|          9, 10         | 11+ |   10+  |    8+   |
|       11 or more       | 12+ |   11+  |   10+   |

If the number on the table is rolled or exceeded, the individual has contracted the disease. Immediately roll two dice and subtract the skill level of  any attending medic (one medic may attend up to four persons). That number is the immediate damage inflicted. If it exceeds 8, roll again as before, and inflict that number of hits. Continue until the result is less than 8.

## The Ship

The following is a description of the Annic Nova in the same format as the Traveller ship descriptions.

Free Trader (Non-Standard Classified Type NS18):
Using an unorthodox 600 ton frame and hull, this artifact is allowed in Imperial commerce under the salvage laws provided the ship is registered with Imperial authorities (typical registration fee: Cr100,000).

The ship has 8 staterooms (of non-standard sizes) for the crew (captain/ navigator, chief engineer, two ordinary engineers, and medic), with provision for ordinary members (gunners, pinnace pilots, or passengers). There are no low berths.

The ship has two jump-drives (jump drive-F, and jump drive-J which operate independently (at J-2, and J-3, respectively). but may not sum their power. There are no maneuver drives (the pinances act as tugs to a minor extent); there is no power plant.

A stellar collector absorbs and collects energy for internal power and jump drives.

Two single turrets each mount a single laser cannon. Cargo bays hold up to 150 tons.

The computer is a non-standard model equivalent to a Model/3, but with nearly three times normal mass.

The ship is not streamlined.

Two 40 ton pinnaces travel in trailing positions. Each holds 12 tons of fuel. One is equipped to carry four passengers for relatively long periods of time; the other can shuttle up to 16 passengers or 12 tons of cargo.

Construction cost is impossible to calculate, but current market value can be placed at approximately Cr200,000,000.

# Library Data

Library data is information obtainable from any ship's computer (although probably not from the Annie Nova's) in response to correct keywords. Only the specific information requested should be given to the players; care should be taken not to reveal additional data as the information is made known.

## Atmosphere Tester

The Survival Products "Sniffer" Atmosphere Tester is a solid state miniaturized gaseous analyzer incorporating microprocessor circuitry to detect and indicate the molecular components in gas samples passing its detector head. The Sniffer is typical of most atmosphere testers on the market today.

### Specifications

One kilogram weight, and measuring 100mm by 175mm by 20mm. Corrosion resistant case of phenolic plastic. 8.7 to 9.3 volt power supply, from rechargable battery pack. Estimated charge life: 100 hours. Belt attachment available, optional. Sling carrying strap standard. Price: Cr150. TL 9.

### Operation

The device is in constant operation, with LEDs indicating chemical symbol for the three major components in the gas sample, with percentage of total shown. Pressing the button labelled "More" replaces this with the next three components. Up to 30 components and percentages may be read in this manner. in addition, three lights (red, amber, and green) are mounted on the face of the device. Whenever the light (or lights) showing changes, an audible beep indicates the change. Red indicates that the atmosphere is not breathable. Green indicates that it is. Green and amber indicates that it is breathable but tainted. Red and amber indicates that the atmosphere is not breathable and also contains material considered to be taint. Amber alone indicates a lack of pressure, but breathable mixture. The exact mixtures which trigger the lights are set at the factory, but may be adjusted to fit personal preference.

### Serial Numbers

Sniffers are numbered in the format nnnn-xxxx-y. N is the model year number; the year of production. X is the serial number. Y is a check digit to insure the correct serial number is stated.

### Recall Notice

Sniffers in the 4000 serial number range may have been assembled with a faulty detector head casing; this, in combination with the plastic case, allows gas to infiltrate onto the interior of the case. In some cases (insidious atmosphere) this may result in the contamination of the solid state electronics, and result in faulty readings, or outright failure. Such items should be returned to a factory representative for repair. Those with a two-digit check digit have already been recalled and repaired.

## Battle Dress

See [[Central Supply Catalog#BATTLE DRESS]]

Battle dress is somewhat bulky, but is roughly man-sized. Probably best thought of as a cross-between a 1950's conception of a "space suit" and plate armor. It should have some equipment built into it and thus increases its bulk. For example, a life support/power unit would not be a separate unit, but instead integrated into the suit back. No weapons are integral, but a visible computer socket/link is placed on the chest front at the right and left shoulders where a rifle would normally be braced.

## Combat Armor

Unpowered and fairly light-weight personal armor. Inexpensive when compared to battle dress, combat armor is widespread in military use for higher technology forces, and usually contains integral communications equipment. Armor protection is similar to battle dress.

## Empress Nicholle

Eleventh in the line of emperors of the lmperium. Oldest issue of Martin V. Born 401, proclaimed  mpress in 457, assassinated 475 by Cleon IV. Second empress to hold the throne.  The fact that Nicholle was assassinated by her successor is indicative of the strained fabric of the Imperium in those days before the Civil War and the Barracks Emperors. The incident, and the pressure of certain member worlds of the Imperium led to the establishment (now somewhat discredited) of succession by right of assassination.

## Pyramid

Traditional construction form for developing cultures; considered to be the simplest form of large scale architecture because of its load-bearing strength and ease of assembly. TL 1. Pyramid structures of all sizes have been believed to serve as focuses for psionic (or cosmic) power, and are claimed to sharpen dulled edges, cure diseases, and generally work miracles. Pyramids have been constructed on most worlds where the local culture has passed through TL 1. Many examples remain due to the massive strength of the structure.

## Second Frontier War (615-620)

Fought between the Outworld Coalition (Zhodani, Vargr, and Sword Worlds) and the lmperium during the period of the Barracks Emperors. Arbellatra (b. 587, d. 666) was named Grand-Admiral of the Marches and led the combined local and Imperial forces to defeat the Coalition, and then proceeded to restablish the central Imperial authority. She was named Regent in 622 as a result, and Empress in 629.

## Vargr

Intelligent alien race occupying an expanse of stars roughly to coreward of the Imperium. These Vargr Extents are inhabited by Vargr although not under any central authority.
Vargr are roughly humanoid derived from carnivore/chaser stock. Originally pack animals, they continue to congregate in groups or tribes with extensive and standing rituals which determine individual position within the group. Continuing rivalry between packs has made large scale cooperation impossible within the Extents; while planetary governments exist, their power is limited. Interstellar government on the subsector or imperial level has proven impossible.
It has been demonstrated that Vargr are the result of genetic manipulation by the Ancients. They did not evolve naturally, and they have a racial sensitivity on this matter.
