This alliance of free traders offers many benefits to independent merchants, including increased buying power, client networking, increased sales and a wider customer base. The more members that join, the greater the benefits. Members pay an annual fee to be in the Arkesh Spacers and they have to follow the traders' code of conduct. This means that anyone dealing with the member company can be confident that they are dealing with a legitimate and trusted business.

The code of conduct that all members must adhere to is in place to ensure that all members remain politically neutral and operate in accordance with both Imperial High Law and the local laws of the worlds on which they trade. The code also states that members should log their planned travel routes where possible at Arkesh Spacer facilities. This allows the Arkesh Spacers to analyse trade routes and ultimately provide better services and facilities where trade is most common.

Random checks are made on members to verify that they are adhering to the code but as the Spacers grow in size, it becomes more difficult to authenticate and monitor its members. This resulted in several illicit operations slipping through the cracks. Although the culprits are usually caught and prosecuted, their affiliation to the Arkesh Spacers has tarred the organization with the same brush.

In an effort to improve their reputation, the Arkesh Spacers have built several new outposts to administer areas that that are too distant from their headquarters in [[Lunion Subsector]]. One of these outposts has been built on [[Gougeste]] to administer, supervise and facilitate their members in Jewell.

# Gougeste Facilities

## ASOC

The Arkesh Spacers Operations Centre is the main corporate office on [[Gougeste]]. From here they administer member services and oversee the running of the city.

> There are two [[#ASOC SECURITY GUARDS]] who patrol the building and another two inside the security room who monitor the security cameras. For every attempt made to bypass the locks or security systems there is a one in six chance of the guards patrolling that area. If the guards are injured, it will reduce the players' chance of getting any cooperation from the Arkesh Spacers later on.
>
> With a successful Computers check DM –4, the blueprints to the building can be obtained from the construction company. Other security procedures can be found out by subtle observation and talking to employees. With enough information the players should be able to determine a security flaw and gain access without being detected.
>
> The main door can only be unlocked with an Engineering (Electronics) check DM –4 and the emergency exit can only be opened from the inside. All of the internal office doors have low security locks and no DM is applied to the Engineering (Electronics) check. The only way inside the building without being seen is through one of the windows but these are linked to the security system and must be deactivated with an Engineering (Electronics) check DM –2.
>
> There are computers in all of the office rooms but they are remotely powered down during the night and can only be turned on from the main computer center. However, the computers in offices 1 and 2 are not powered down as they are for the use of anyone who is working after hours.
>
> If an intruder is detected, the security guards will immediately inform each other and the main security headquarters (SHQ) who will send reinforcements. The guards in the security room will use the cameras to inform their comrades of where the intruders are.

## SHQ

There may be no official law on [[Gougeste]] but the Arkesh Spacers do have their own security force to deal with any trouble that gets out of hand. The Security Headquarters is located in the Commercial Dome and always has a number of guards on standby.

## The Spacers Retreat

One of the most popular bars for employees of the Arkesh Spacers, this large establishment is always packed during the evenings. Although it caters to employees, locals and member companies are also welcome here.

## Oasis

This drinking establishment can be found in the Commercial Dome near the access tunnels to the starport and is popular with travellers and traders. It is often the first stop for people who have recently arrived but it does have a fair amount of regulars too. The atmosphere inside 'The Spacers' is usually loud and a little rough but the place does have a certain charm. Due to the free traders and merchants who can always be found here, it is a good place to make contacts.

#### ARKESH SPACERS


Arkesh started out as an alliance of Free Traders which still maintains a nominal headquarters at Strouden however, it has few permanent facilities, relying on leasing or trading for whatever is needed. Arkesh has a bad reputation for highly dubious practices; some of its ships are known smugglers and there are rumors that acts of piracy have been committed by some members. Thus far, the organization has avoided Imperial attention though some of its members have been prosecuted.
