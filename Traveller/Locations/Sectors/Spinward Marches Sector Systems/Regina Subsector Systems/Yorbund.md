Yorbund is 7,000 miles in diameter, with an insidious corrosive atmosphere, and seas of fluid covering 60% of its surface.

Yorbund has a population of 227,000 persons, with no established government. A generally accepted law level of 3 will prohibit energy weapons and autorifles. Local technological level is 7, equivalent to the period 1970 to 1979 (only limited manufacturing of TL7 materials is possible, due to the low population base). The local starport is classed as type C, and is located near the major population center of the world.

Much of Yorbund is unexplored, with the population concentrated in a few underground complexes. Yorbund's major resource is fungi grown in the caverns; it provides food, fibers for cloth, fuel, and is exported as pharmaceuticals.

# Details

Ice asteroids in Yorbund's two large planetoid belts provide the only available source of fuel within the system.

## Mainworld Topography and Geography

Yorbund has a warm climate and a corrosive fluorine atmosphere that has so far limited efforts to explore the planet. The surface remains largely un-mapped and the general terrestrial climate is overcast with an almost constant, corrosive drizzle accompanied by a roiling fog composed of fluorine and other exotic elements and combinations in gaseous form.
