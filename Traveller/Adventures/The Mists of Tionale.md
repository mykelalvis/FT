This is a comprehensive adventure for
**Traveller** entitled _The Mists of Tionale_. Through a series of events, it entangles a band of adventurers in a mystery and ecological battle. Their actions could shape the future for an entire species. This adventure can act as a stand-alone adventure or as part of a larger campaign.

It is assumed that this adventure will be administered by a referee who has read through this booklet, and who is familiar with both it and the rules to **Traveller**. This book is based on the basic **Traveller** set (Basic Rules), and no additional supplements, books, or other information. As usual, paper, pencils, six-sided dice, and square-grid graph paper will prove necessary during the course of this adventure.

**Optional References:** The wide range of additional
**Traveller** materials remain available to the referee and they may be used if they are available and for the needs of the situation. Specific materials referred to within this book are not required. They are mentioned in order to allow their use for the referee’s convenience; they may be easily substituted by other materials, or by the referee’s own imagination.

**Chapters:** The adventure is divided into chapters. Specific chapters are intended for specific purposes; some are intended for the use of the referee while others provide material directly for the players. The purpose is to direct information to the proper individuals in the most convenient manner.

## STANDARDS AND ASSUMPTIONS



The following standards and assumptions are used in the text of this adventure, The referee may alter them by using a different time frame, or by using worlds set in a different **Traveller** universe run by the referee.


This adventure begins on 054-1107. Once the adventure begins, then time should flow normally.

This adventure takes place entirely on the world of [[Tionale]] (C674321-8). 
## CHARACTERS

This adventure is intended for use with any group of adventurers available; they can be any sort of individuals as long as they are looking for some type of remunerative job. The text of the adventure can be altered to use nearly any type of adventuring group. 

Pre-Generated Characters: A group of pre-generated characters is provided , although the referee may allow other characters instead. Any group of characters will suffice provided they have a wide range of skills and are adequately played by the players. Important skills for this adventure include blade combat, gun combat and streetwise. If pre-generated characters are used, but there are fewer than eight adventurers in the adventurers, the first listed characters should be used first. 

1. **Ex- Merchant Captain** 7989A7 Age 34 4 terms Cr25,000 Admin-1, Blade-1, Bribery-1, Gun Cbt-1, Navigation-1, Pilot- 2 Gun, Far Trader

2. **Retired Army Lt. Col.** 6778B9 Age 46 7 terms Cr45,000 Gambling-1, Electronics-1, Mechanical-2, Rifle-1, SMG-2, Tactics-1, Vehicle- 2 Gun, High Passage

3. **Retired Scout** 8978A6 Age 38 5 terms Cr40,000 Blade-1, Computer-1, Gun Cbt-1, Medical-2, Navigation-2, Pilot- 1 Blade, Gun

4. **Ex-Navy Commander** 788AC9 Age 30 3 terms Cr50,000 Blade-1, Engineering-2, Gun Cbt-1, Ship’s Boat-2, Vacc Suit- 1 Blade, TAS

5. **Ex-Other** 696CB7 Age 50 8 terms Cr30,000 Blade-1, Bribery-2, Gun Cbt-1, Forgery-2, Gambling-1, Streetwise- 2 Gun, High Passage

7. **Ex-Navy Lieutenant** 7A9986 Age 30 3 terms Cr20,000 Blade-1, Gunnery-2, Gun Cbt-1, Medical- 3 Blade, High Passage

8. **Ex-Merchant 2nd Officer** 6798A8 Age 34 4 terms Cr30,000 Admin-2, Blade-1, Gun Cbt-1, Jack-of-Trade-2, Steward- 2 Blade, Gun

Characters may be assigned randomly by the referee, or the players may be allowed to select the ones they specifically want by some sort of seniority system.

### Desirable Skills

The specific usefulness of any skill, ultimately depends on the players and how they use their characters. Nevertheless, vacc suit skill and weapon skill can be of relatively great importance to all characters. For those characters who do not have any vacc suit skill or desire to use other weapons, assign them vacc-0 and weapon-0. Vacc-0 indicates a certain familiarity with vacc suits sufficient to allow the use of one and to avoid making fatal mistakes when in vacuum. Weapon-0 should be taken by the individual in a specific weapon. Ideally the weapon will be mated to the individual’s strength and dexterity to allow dexterity bonuses, or to avoid dexterity penalties. In addition, weapon-0 avoids the negative DM associated with lack of skill.
### EQUIPMENT

Referees using an on-going campaign should ignore the remainder of this section.

Characters should review their equipment, and may purchase made. Each of the pre-generated characters has no items other than those detailed in the listing. At the beginning of the adventure, before the characters are told the details of their predicament, they should be told they are interstellar travellers in search of a job, and allowed to purchase any equipment they feel will be necessary or desirable. Any equipment available may be purchased subject only to the following restrictions:

The equipment must be mentioned and priced in Book 1 or Book 2 of **Traveller** or in the available equipment table, and

The price indicated must be paid.

Note that price levels preclude some equipment (for example, battle dress) due to the restricted finances of the group. Once the adventure begins, the items in the available equipment table are no longer possible to purchase, and only specific items of tech level 8 or less will be on the market to purchase.

### Available Equipment

The [[#Available Equipment Table]] presents  items which is also available to the adventurers. Individual characters may purchase, carry, and use these which are selected.

Players should be allowed approximately ten minutes to select the equipment which they would like.

The adventurers having access to a starship is essential, whether this is their own or through employment by a trade organization. The Ex-Merchant Captain in the pre-generated characters has a Far Trader which fulfills this criteria.

### Available Equipment Table

Filter Plugs: (Cr 25; TL 5). Filter plugs are an alternate to Filter Masks. Fitting into the nasal passages of most sophonts, they allow a trained user to breathe in tainted atmospheres without having to wear a full filter mask. Anyone with Marine, Navy or Scout background is automatically trained in the use of filter plugs. Other careers can receive the training for an additional Cr 250.

Mind Shield Diadem: (Cr 10000; TL 13). A refined version of the artificial mind shield, a special crystal in the mind shield diadem provides protection against telepathic intrusion. Mind shield diadems are rare, and generally only available to Imperial nobility. Limited to one purchase only.


### STARTING THE ADVENTURE

The referee should ensure that the players each have their characters, and should inform players of the basic background facts given in Standards and Assumptions.

Next, the referee should run the players through the events in the chapter [[#Complications With Repairs]].  This takes place on [[Tionale]], and introduces the adventurers to the situation they will be have to deal with.  

Before the adventurers set off to begin their investigations, they should have a further opportunity to buy anything additional they feel they might need, and to do research. When all the preliminaries are completed, the main adventure begins with [[#Into The Mists]].

![[MofT-6352.jpg]]
# Complications With Repairs

The failure of a key component in the Jump drive had forced your hand in seeking repairs at the [[Tionale#D’unsin City|starport]]. Luckily, the usually very busy docks had had space to accommodate your needs. Rosa Dynalez, the senior spaceport engineering officer, had promised the repairs would be completed within three days. And so, on the morning of the fourth day, after departing your accommodations, you made your way to the repair bays.

## “ONE OF OUR COMPONENTS IS MISSING”

Although the spaceport repair bays are normally swarming with people, on this particular morning the place is even busier than usual.

If the adventurers stop anyone to ask why there appears to be such a commotion, they may or may not get a response ( **_roll 9+; DM +1 Soc 8+, +1 Streetwise-1 - failure, the adventurers are told to find Rosa, success, the adventurers are told there has been a robbery_** ). If they ask where they can find Rosa, the adventurers will be directed to the bay their starship is housed in.

If the adventurers proceed to the bay, they will find that the commotion appears to be centered upon that location. They will find Rosa talking to a short, much more elderly man ( roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 8+, + Streetwise- 1 - the patches on the man’s outfit mark him as local law enforcement ). As they approach, Rosa will spot the adventurers and turn towards them. “I am so glad to see you. I was just about to call you.”

In conversation, Rosa will explain that the repair bay was hit by an indigenous raiding party overnight. Amongst the items taken was the Jump drive component, which was removed from the starship.

> “We will ensure that a new one is ordered immediately, and will get the repairs completed as soon as possible. However, it will likely take at least six weeks before we will have the job finished.”

If the adventurers ask either Rosa or the law enforcement officer about what action will be taken to find the stolen goods, they will both shrug their shoulders. “Look, these things happen. We just don’t have the time or available resources to pursue the thieves. Of course, if you chose to investigate yourself, and then try to retrieve the items, there is nothing we would do to stop you.”


## CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATIONS

If the adventurers choose to examine the crime scene they will find there is no-one around to stop them. Rosa and the investigator make no moves to prevent them from doing so either.

There are two main locations to examine - the repair bay and the starship.

As the adventurers search the repair bay they may find a number of clues to help determine what happened ( **_roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 8+, +1 Educ 9+, + Engineering-1, +1 Streetwise-1, +1 ex-Army or ex-Scout_** ). The adventurers can make one roll per 15 minutes of searching. For each success they find one of the following pieces of evidence:

- Large footprints lead from the jungle line to the repair bay rear entrance, and show that they retreated in that direction as well.
- The footprints indicate that the thieves were over 2 meters in height, heavily-built, and had clawed toes. This matches with descriptions of the indigenous species, the Sixes.
- Depth of the footprints indicate that the thieves took special care to walk in each other’s tread, concealing their overall numbers.
- The lock to the rear entrance to the repair bay was sheared off, allowing entry to the bay.
- The cabinets, lockers, and drawers on each desk in the repair bay have been ripped open and rummaged through.
- An oily footprint inside the repair bay reinforces the footprint findings from the exterior of the bay.
- The thieves evidently took tools and equipment with them when they departed, as there are more tools missing from the cabinets and shelves than are present in the mess on the floor.
- All then tools taken are used in repairs to starship drive systems.

Moving on to investigate the interior of their starship, the adventurers may find a number of clues to help determine what happened ( **_roll 7+; DM +1 Intel 8+,
+1 Educ 9+, +1 Engineering-1, +1 Streetwise-1, +1 ex_**

**_- Army or ex-Scout_** ). The adventurers can make one roll per 15 minutes of searching. For each success they find one of the following pieces of evidence:

- It appears that only one of the indigenous creatures went onto the starship.
- A second set of oily footprints lead onto the starship but are booted, and of average humanoid size.
- Each of the staterooms were searched but nothing was taken.
- The arms locker was searched but no weapons or ammunition were taken.
- Tools are strewn around the floor beside the Jump drive and the replacement component has been removed ( **_roll 8+; DM +1 Intel 8+, +1 Educ 8+, +1 Computer-1, +1 Engineering- 1 - computer logs show that the component was installed and tested, so the repairs had been completed_** ).

Once the adventurers are satisfied that they have completed their investigation, they will need to decide how to proceed.

## THE NEXT STEPS



If the adventurers speak with either Rosa or the police investigator in regards to the evidence they have found they will find them sympathetic but unwilling to help any further. They simple do not have the resources to pursue the indigenous thieves, who they will identify as Sixes.

> “Look, we’re really sorry but its outside our area of influence. However, if you want to go looking for them yourselves, then please go ahead with out blessing.” No one in the settlement will offer any additional help.

## Into The Mists

##### TRACKING THE THIEVES

Pursuing the thieves and retrieving the stolen components appears to be the best option available to the adventurers. If they attempt pursuit by air, they will quickly discover that the jungle canopy is extensive and sensors have a great deal of difficulty penetrating it, making tracking any life-forms beneath the canopy from above the canopy effectively impossible. This is partly why there has never been an accurate census made of the indigenous population.

Pursuing the thieves on the ground is a better option. Unfortunately, due to the high level of foliage large ATVs are unsuitable for traversing the terrain. However, the colonists do make use of individual [[Quad Bike ATV]]s. The adventurers will be able to hire these from a local supplier for Cr 100 per day per bike ( **_roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Soc 9+, +1 Bribery-1, + Streetwise- 1 - success reduces this to Cr 50 per day per bike_** ). Alternatively, they could buy the quad bikes ( **_roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Soc 9+, +1 Bribery-1, + Streetwise- 1 - success reduces the price to Cr 2000 per bike_** ).



### “YOU’VE SEEN ONE JUNGLE ...”

Due to Tionale's jungle [[Tionale#Environment|environment]], and tainted atmosphere, some precautions are in order.

To ensure the adventurers have the best chance of surviving in this potentially hostile environment they may wish to purchase appropriate jungle survival gear, which is available at a number of stores in [[Tionale#D’unsin City|D'unsin City]]. A standard jungle survival pack will cost Cr 500 per pack, and includes the following:

- Jungle Survival Clothing - treated as Jack, provides majority body coverage to protect against insect bites
- Short-Range Communicator
- Magnetic Compass
- 2 Cold Light Lanterns
- Tarpaulin
- Subsistence Rations for 5 days
- 2 liter water bottle with filter system
- Basic First Aid supplies, including 3 broad spectrum anti-venom ampules
- Fire Lighter
- Machete

Any of the adventurers with a background in Army, Marines, or Scouts will likely have received jungle survival training ( **_roll 7+; DM +1 Intel 8+, +1 Educ 8+, +1 two-terms, +2 three or more terms_** ). If an adventurer has received survival training then they will know the following information:

- Shelters - they will know how to construct a shelter using the available resources in the rainforest. They will know to avoid large bodies of water, and to avoid flood-prone locations for sheltering. They will know to ensure that they construct a raised bed toa avoid any ground-level creatures.
- Water - they will know how to locate sources of water for drinking., and how to make such water safe for consumption. They will also know that vines can be used as a source of water, as long as the sap runs clear.
- Food - they will know how to identify edible plants and fruits in the rainforest, and will know to trap small creatures which could then be eaten.
- Creatures - they will generally be able to identify signs of animal habitation in an area. They may be able to recognise tracks of predators ( **_roll 8+; DM +1 Intel 8+, +1 Educ 9+, +2 ex-Scout_** ).

![[MofT-6365.jpg]]
### LET THE HUNT BEGIN

Once all the preparations have been made, and any necessary equipment has been purchased, the adventurers can start tracking the thieves.

The trail from the repair bays leading into the jungle is not too difficult to track ( **_roll 8+; DM +1 Intel 8+, + Educ 9+, +1 ex-Army or ex-Marine, +2 ex-Scout_** ). Given the information from Rosa and the detective, the thieves have approximately a four hour head start and are familiar with the terrain. For each hour of tracking, the adventurers will need to make another roll:

- Success - the adventurers are able to clearly follow the trail of the thieves. Make next roll.
- Failure - the adventurers lose the trail. They spend an hour having to back track and look for fresh signs. Make next roll.
- Failure by 3 or more - the adventurers lose the trail. They spend three hours searching for clues before being allowed to make another roll.

As the adventurers travel through the jungle, they may face difficulties caused by events or creatures they encounter enroute ( 8+ roll for an encounter made every 2 hours of travel ). If the party have an encounter roll on the [[Tionale#Tionale Jungle Encounter Table|encounter table]] to determine its nature.

# Village of the Sixes

After following the trail for twelve hours the adventurers may hear noise ahead of them ( **_roll 8+; DM +1 Intel 8+, +1 ex-Army or ex-Marine, +2 ex-Scout_** ). It appears to be some form of drumbeat or similar rhythmic sound. They may also notice the smell of smoke and signs of a fire ahead ( **_roll as before_** ). The trail heads towards these, and as the adventurers get closer they can roll again ( **_reduce difficult by 1 for every 50m closer_** ).

## A VILLAGE IN THE MISTS

![[MofT-6241.jpg|200]]
[[MofT-6241.jpg|Sixes Village]]


As the adventurers continue to pursue the trail of the thieves, a head of them appears a small clearing in the jungle. Located in the clearing is a small collection of primitive dwellings, belong to a tribe of [[Sixes]].

The village is comprised of nine huts spread around a central larger building, with lanterns placed strategically between the structures. A fire pit is located at one side of the larger building, and acts as a gathering place for the tribe.

The noises and the smoke that the adventurers may have spotted belong to what appears to be some form of celebration being held by the residents of the village. There are nine [[Sixes]] eating, drinking and making merry in the open area of the village around the fire pit. None of the [[Sixes]] appear to be armed, although their sheer size would suggest that their need for weapons is limited, if they get within arms length. Piled up on the far side of the central building are tools and other items that were taken from [[Tionale#D’unsin City|D'unsin starport]] during the recent raid.

## “WELL, HELLO THERE.”

At this point, the adventurers have a few options available to them:

- They can storm into the village and confront the Sixes.
- They can try to sneak in and recover the missing piece of equipment.
- They can wait till the Sixes are asleep and then try to sneak in to recover the equipment.
- They can attempt to open dialogue with the Sixes.

Other options are also possible, and the adventurers may think of something that is not covered by any of these.

Storming into the village, although an option, is not a tactically sound choice. Any adventurer with a military background will easily realize this ( **_roll 7+; DM + Intel 8+, +1 Educ 9+, +1 Tactics-1, +2 ex-Army or ex-Marine, +1 ex-Navy or ex-Scout - although their numbers are small, the size and nature of the Sixes makes an armed confrontation risky_** ). If the adventurers choose to follow this route despite their understanding of the risks, then they will find themselves facing nine very angry and very capable Sixes.

```

**Sixes Warrior** HAA

Brawling 2, Stinger 3 Stinger, Cloth+

(Hides provide protection equivalent to Cloth+1)

```

If the adventurers conceal themselves first and then attack from hiding, the Sixes will quickly locate their hiding positions ( **_roll 5+; DM – 1 Intel 9+, -1 Tactics-1, - 2 ex-Army or ex-Marine or ex-Scout, +1 for each round of combat beyond first - success means that the Sixes have located the adventurers hiding places_** ) and will respond appropriately to any attack. 

In any combat, the Sixes will focus on neutralizing the adventurers. Once an adventurer is rendered unconscious they will no longer be targeted.  If the Sixes manage to neutralize all the adventurers they will tie them up using vines, and will then place them in a makeshift holding pen that they will construct from wood and vines. Adventurers can try to escape from the vines used to tie them up ( **_roll 8+; DM +1 Str 8+, +1 Dex 8+, +1 Streetwise-1, +1 Tactics-1, +1 ex-Army or ex-Marine, +2 ex-Scout_** ). Escaping from the holding pen is more challenging as there will always be a Sixes guarding them.

The options of sneaking into the Sixes camp and retrieving the technology are slightly better.

If the adventurers try to sneak into the camp while the Sixes are still celebrating they are more likely to be spotted ( **_roll 9+; DM +1 Dex 8+, +1 Intel 9+, +1 ex-Army or ex-Marine, +2 ex-Scout or ex-Other, -1 for every additional adventurer sneaking in - failure means that the Sixes have spotted the adventurers_** ). Three successes are needed to reach the pile of equipment without being spotted. Successfully searching through the equipment without being spotted requires a further three successes, and then three more successes will be needed to sneak back out of the camp.

If the adventurers are spotted, the Sixes will respond aggressively. Three of them will move to attack the adventurers, while the other six will move to secure the stolen equipment and to take up defensive positions in the camp. If the adventurers defeat the first three Sixes, a further three will move to attack, and the final three will move to attack if those three are also defeated. As with a direct attack approach, the Sixes will focus on neutralizing the adventurers. Once an adventurer is rendered unconscious they will no longer be targeted. If all the adventurers are rendered unconscious, the Sixes will tie them up using vines and place them in a makeshift holding pen.  Adventurers can try to escape from the vines used to tie them up ( ***roll 8+; DM +1 Str 8+, +1 Dex 8+, +1 Streetwise-1, +1 Tactics-1, +1 ex-Army or ex-Marine, +2 ex-Scout*** ). Escaping from the holding pen is more challenging as there will always be a Sixes guarding them. 


If the adventurers choose to wait until the Sixes go to sleep before trying to sneak in, they will need to wait for several hours before the celebration grinds to a halt. One Six will remain on guard, and will be replaced after two hours by another of the tribe. When all the Sixes, except the one on guard, have retired tot heir individual huts, it is much easier to sneak into the camp ( roll 7+; DM +1 Dex 8+, +1 Intel 9+, +1 ex-Army or ex-Marine, +2 ex-Scout or ex-Other, -1 for every additional adventurer sneaking in - failure means that the Sixes guard has spotted the adventurers ). Three successes are needed to reach the pile of equipment without being spotted. Successfully searching through the equipment without being spotted requires a further three successes, and then three more successes will be needed to sneak back out of the camp. If the guard spots any adventures it will raise the alarm. 

If the adventurers attempt to neutralize the guard before sneaking into the camp, they would need to do sufficient damage to render the Six unconscious in one round or it will raise the alarm. 

If the alarm is raised, the sleeping Sixes will respond after one additional round of combat. They will then act in a similar manner as to detecting the adventurers sneaking into the camp during the celebration. 

If the guard is successfully neutralized, the adventurers will find completing their search much easier ( for any remaining checks roll 5+; DM +1 Dex 8+, +1 Intel 9+, +1 ex-Army or ex-Marine, +2 ex-Scout or ex-Other, -1 for every additional adventurer sneaking in - failure means that one of the sleeping Sixes has been disturbed and will investigate the noise ). The adventurers will have one round to neutralize the awakened Six or the alarm will be raised as above.

Searching through the pile of equipment is a daunting task ( **_roll 10+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Educ 8+, + Electronics-1, +1 Engineering-1, +1 Mechanical- 1_** ). The adventurers will find that the equipment comprises electronics and mechanical parts used in starships. Unfortunately, the specific piece for their starship jump drive is not present in the pile.

The final option of attempting to open dialogue with the Sixes may prove to be the safest approach.

If the adventurers approach the camp openly while the celebrations are ongoing, the Sixes will stop and initially take up a defensive posture. Six of them will move to protect the stolen equipment while three will move to intercept the adventurers. The Sixes will not initiate combat but the three that move towards the adventurers will be clearly ready to fight.

Once the adventurers try to communicate, the Sixes will change their initial posture. The ones protecting the equipment will remain doing so while the other three will attempt to communicate back to the adventurers.

Communication between the adventures and the Sixes does not prove easy. Imperial research has not been able to translate the language used by the Sixes beyond rudimentary concepts ( **_roll 10+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Educ 9+, +1 Jack-of-Trades-1, +1 ex-Scout_** ).

Attempts to communicate can be improved by the following:

- Clearly removing weaponry and placing it openly on the ground ( **_DM +1_** ).
- Offering food after demonstrating that it is food by eating it first I **_DM +1_** ).
- Taking a seated position in a non-aggressive posture ( **_DM +1_** ).
- Offering a piece of equipment as a gift while gesturing towards the equipment pile ( **_DM +1_** ).

If the adventurers succeed in opening communications with the Sixes, then they will make gestures that clearly indicate to wait ( **_roll 8+; DM +1 Intel 9+, + Educ 9+, +1 Jack-of-Trades-1, +1 ex-Scout - success means the adventurers recognise the gesture to mean wait_** ) and one of the Sixes will disappear into the central hut. Shortly afterwards they will reemerge with another Six. This Six appears slightly different from the others, being larger and is adorned with facial markings and wearing a chain of teeth around its neck ( roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Educ 9+, + Leader-1, +1 Tactics-1, +1 ex-Army or ex-Marine - success means the adventurers realize this is the tribe leader ). If the adventurers are captured by the Sixes, once they have recovered, the tribe leader will emerge and will attempt to open communication with them. 

## OPENING TRADE

The tribe leader will take up a seated position beside the fire pit and will gesture for the adventurers to join them. Once the adventurers have done so, the tribe leader will start by speaking, “Karoth!”, and will place its right upper forearm on its chest. It will then point to each of the adventurers in turn (repeating until they say their names). 

Once introductions have been made, Karoth will then say “Karoth trade!”, gesturing towards the stolen equipment. If the adventurers start trying to have a lengthier conversation, Karoth will gesture stop and shake its head, saying “No! Not know!” 

The adventurers can secure the return of the stolen equipment by offering Karoth food supplies for its tribe or by offering it something shiny and impressive ( ***roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 8+, +1 Educ 9+, +1 Bribery-1, +1 Jack-of-Trades-1, +1 ex-Scout or ex-Other, +2 ex-Merchant*** ). 

Unfortunately, the piece for the starship jump drive is not amongst the stolen equipment, If the adventurers show Karoth a picture of the item, or draw a diagram or something similar, Karoth will answer by saying “Starman take!” 

Karoth will gesture to one of the other Sixes and will speak with them briefly. It will then turn to the adventurers and say “Go with Duruuk!”

Duruuk will lead the adventurers out of the Sixes camp and will take them on a pathway heading away from the village and from the settlement. Anyone checking will notice tracks on the ground indicating a standard sized humanoid has used this trail recently.

# A Meeting Of Minds
The adventurers are taken a considerable distance away from the Sixes village by Duruuk. The trail it follows takes them through the jungle and further away from the settlement as well. After about two hours of travel, the adventurers will notice what looks like a mountain range ahead of them. If the adventurers take a sensor reading the results will be interesting ( **_roll 8+; DM +1 Intel 8+, +1 Educ 8+, + Computer-1, +1 Electronics- 1 - the mountains have a high mineral content making sensor readings unreliable_** ).

Duruuk leads the adventurers only a little further before gesturing ahead of itself. Ahead, the trail starts to open out into a small clearing at the base of the mountain range. As the adventurers proceed they will see there is a starship carefully positioned in the start of the mountain range.

## SCOUT SHIP DOWN

![[MofT-6372.jpg|200]]
[[MofT-6372.jpg|Downed Scout Ship]]

The starship is a scout class vessel (anyone with any military or space background will instantly recognise this fact). The markings upon its hull are in an alien language ( ***roll 8+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Educ 9+, +2 ex-Merchant or ex-Navy or ex-Scout, +1 ex-Army or ex-Marine - the markings are in Zhodani*** ). There has been a clear attempt to conceal the presence of the starship, camouflage netting and leaves from the jungle cover the surface of the vessel. That, along with the high mineral content of the local rocks, has ensured that the starship has gone undetected by the locals. Evidence in, and around, the clearing indicates that there is at least one crewmember still alive (tracks, remains of a fire, a pit dug for waste disposal). 

Approaching the starship undetected is not an easy task ( **_roll 9+; DM +1 Dex 9+, +1 Tactics-1, +2 ex-Scout, +1 ex-Army or ex-Marine_** ). If the adventurers are successful, they manage to reach the hatch of the starship without alerting anyone onboard. If they are unsuccessful, anyone onboard the scout ship is alerted to the presence of the adventurers and will make appropriate preparations. Once the adventurers are closer to the starship, they can make a better assessment of the vessel ( **_roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 8+, +1 Educ 9+, +1 Engineering-1, +1 Mechanical-1, +1 ex-Navy or ex-Scout - scoring on the hull indicates that the starship made a controlled crashlanding_** ). If they take the time to do a more thorough examination of the vessel the adventurers will need to roll again to avoid detection and can then check what they find ( **_roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 8+, +1 Educ 9+, +1 Engineering- 1, +1 Mechanical-1, +1 ex-Merchant or ex-Navy, +2 ex-Scout - there appears to be some damage sustained to the drive systems, however, to learn more would require interrogating the starship computer_** ).

There are two possible points to gain entry to the starship, a hatch on the bow ( **_roll 11+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Educ 9+, +1 Computer-1, +1 Electronics-1, +1 Engineering- 1 - success bypasses the security lockout and the hatch can be opened_** ) which leads to the bridge of the ship, and an airlock door on the port front quarter ( **_roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Educ 9+, +1 Computer-1, +1 Electronics-1, +1 Engineering- 1 - success bypasses the security lockout and the airlock door can be opened_** ) leading into the crew recreation area. The cargo bay doors are not accessible without clambering around the ship’s hull, which would definitely alert anyone onboard.

## “ALL ABOARD!”

The Zhodani scout ship is comprised of seven compartments. Each compartment has pressure doors between them, ensuring that the integrity of the ship is secure in the event of a hull breach.

The doors are sealed with standard security protocols which the adventurers can attempt to bypass ( **_roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Educ 9+, +1 Computer-1, +1 Electronics-1, +1 Engineering- 1 - success bypasses the security protocol, opening the pressure door without setting off any warning alarms_** ).

### ZHODANI SCOUT SHIP
![[MofT-6374.jpg|200]]
[[MofT-6374.jpg|Zhodani Scout Ship]]

```
TONNAGE : 100 tons 
JUMP DRIVE: Jump- 2 
MANEUVER DRIVE: 2G 
POWER PLANT: Standard- 2 
FUEL: 40 tons (1 Jump-2 + power plant) 
GRAVITICS: 1G floor field, inertial compensators. Sleeping plates in staterooms. 
ELECTRONICS: Model-1bis computer 
CREW: One (Pilot/Navigator/Engineer) 
PASSENGERS: None 
CARGO: 15 tons 
ARMAMENTS: None (one hardpoint installed with double-turret but no weapons installed). 
VEHICLES: Air/Raft The Zhodani Scout Service, much like their Imperial counterparts, make use of a standard 100 ton scout ship design. However, unlike the Imperial service scout ship, there is only one stateroom onboard and the tonnage gained is used to boost the cargo capacity of the ship. This also allows for the ship to be smaller in general size, making for a stealthier profile. The ship’s hull is streamlined, allowing for atmospheric flight as well as being able to skim fuel from gas giants or from oceans.

#### Bridge

Section 1

The bridge of the scout ship has a variety of electronic arrays which enable the pilot to control the ship, and to programme the jump drive using the navigation computer. A hatch in the ceiling leads to the outside upper hull of the ship, and the bridge can be depressurized when needed while in space,

The adventurers can attempt to gather information from the ship’s computers from this location ( **_roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 8+, +1 Educ 9+, +1 Computer-1, +1 Electronics- 1_** ). If they are successful they can find out that the scout shup crashed on Tionale approximately eight months earlier after suffering a catastrophic drive component failure. Anyone who checks will realize that the component that failed is identical to the one taken from the Tionale spaceport, and is the same component that the adventurers need for the repair to their starship.

#### Crew Recreation Area
Section 2

This area contains the ship’s galley, where crew members can prepare meals and drinks for themselves. There is also a collapsible table at which the crew can eat their meals. An interface on the table allows for the crew members to paly games and other forms of entertainment. A small storage locker holds a single vacc suit, and the whole area can be depressurized to allow the crew to open the external airlock while in space.
#### Stateroom
Section 3
A standard stateroom with a single bed, small cabinet and a desk.
#### Fresher
Section 4
A standard fresher with a toilet, washbasin and shower facilities.

#### Corridor

Section 5

This short corridor connects the crew quarters with the cargo areas and the engineering area.

Moving around in this area can alert anyone in the Cargo Bay or Engineering to the presence of intruders ( **_roll 9+; DM +1 Dex 8+, +1 Tactics-1, +1 ex-Army or ex-Marine, +2 ex-Navy or ex-Scout - success means the adventurers avoid making noise that is detected beyond this area_** ).

#### Air/Raft and Cargo Bay

Section 6

The cargo bay holds a single air/raft, and has space for up to 15 tons of cargo. The bay can be depressurized, allowing for the cargo bay doors to be opened while in space. This would only be done in an emergency or if the crew knew that any cargo in the bay could withstand the pressure changes and the vacuum of space.

Moving around in this area can alert anyone in the Corridor or Engineering to the presence of intruders ( **_roll 9+; DM +1 Dex 8+, +1 Tactics-1, +1 ex-Army or ex-Marine, +2 ex-Navy or ex-Scout - success means the adventurers avoid making noise that is detected beyond this area_** ).

#### Engineering

Section 7

The power plant, maneuvering drives and jump drives are located in this area. In standard operations, the crew would perform routine maintenance on the drives as necessary.

The scout ship jump drive suffered a catastrophic event upon arrival in the [[Tionale]] system, burning out an uncommon but essential component. Unfortunately, the ship did not carry any spares of this specific component, stranding the pilot on [[Tionale]].

When the adventurers arrive at the scout ship, the pilot is making repairs to the jump drive, having managed to acquire the necessary component from the raid of the spaceport repair bays.

If the adventurers have managed to avoid detection, the pilot will be beneath the jump drive fitting the component into the drive system. If they have been detected, the pilot will be waiting for them in the engineering section, using the drives as cover.

## “MAYBE WE CAN REACH A DEAL?”

The Zhodani Scout simply wants to return home. Unfortunately, to do so, he needs the component that the adventurers need for their starship. He would prefer not to get into a firefight in the confined quarters of his ship and so will try to negotiate a deal with the adventurers first. 

The scout will offer to compensate the adventurers first. He is willing to pay them Cr50000 plus an additional Cr50000 per week that they are inconvenienced for while having to wait for the replacement component to arrive on Tionale. The scout can arrange the transfer of these funds to any bank account that the adventurers choose, and can do this immediately. However, the funds will not complete release until he sends a second code once he has safely departed from Tionale. 

Alternatively, he will ask if any engineers amongst the adventurers can look at his drive system and see if they can jury-rig a temporary repair, enabling the scout ship to depart from Tionale ( ***roll 11+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Educ 9+, +1 Computer-1, +1 Electronics-1, +1 Engineering-1, +1 Mechanical-1, +1 ex-Merchant or ex-Scout - success means the adventurer has managed to rig a temporary bypass using alternative components*** ). If they are successful, the scout will hand over the component that the adventurers need. If none of these options are successful, then he will engage in combat with the adventurers.

## Return To D'unsin Starport

After dealing with the Zhodani scout, the adventurers can make their way back to D’unsin Starport.

If they have the missing component they can present it to Rosa, who will arrange for it to be fitted to their starship immediately. These repairs will take eight hours to complete.

If the adventurers chose to reach a deal with the scout, and sold him the component, they will find that their compensation has been deposited into their account as promised, and will be accessible by the time they arrive back at [[Tionale#D’unsin City|D’unsin Starport]]. In this situation, Rosa will re-order the component for the repair. It will take six weeks for the component to arrive and a further day for the repairs to be completed.

## EVERYTHING IS NOT AS IT SEEMS


If the adventurers chose not to make a deal with he scout, and engage him in combat, they may find that not everything is as they expected it to be.

The Zhodani scout is a very powerful, and talented, telepath. With the ability to alter and implant memories, he used his abilities to convince the adventurers that they defeated him in combat and retrieved the component. However, they have actual returned with the damaged component from the Zhodani scout ship. This is a drawback but it is not insurmountable as Rosa and her team can make repairs to the component, enabling it to be fitted to the adventurers’ starship. This repair will take fifteen hours to complete but will only be a temporary solution, as the component will need to be replaced after three jumps at most.

If the adventurers were able to resist the memory alteration (one or more of them had a mind shield diadem), then the defeat of the scout will be real and they will have retrieved the genuine component. Rosa and her technicians will be able to compete the repairs within eight hours in this situation.

## ESTABLISHING A PEACE



The adventurers may feel that any truce they managed to reach with Karoth and his tribe might be used to establish a more permanent peace between the locals and the Sixes. They can approach various people within the colony to see if there is any interest in this ( ***roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Soc 9+, +1 Admin-1, +1 Leader- 1 - success means that the adventurers have found a local representative that is interested in establishing better relations with the Sixes*** ). If they are successful, the representative will agree to raise the possibility of establishing better relationships with the Sixes at the next assembly, in two months time. 

Unfortunately, if the adventurers are not present at this assembly, the decision will go against them. If they are present, and argue the case, they may be able to change the outcome ( roll 11+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Soc 9+, +1 Admin-1, +1 Leader--success means that the locals agree to attempt to establish peaceful trade with Karoth and his tribe ). 

Brokering such a peace is a much more complex situation, beyond the scope of this adventure. Both the Imperial [[Scout Service]] and the [[Imperial Navy]] will also be interested in learning about the presence of a [[Zhodani]] scout on [[Tionale]], and would definitely want to ask the adventurers more about their encounter with the scout. This may lead to further complications in the future for the adventurers.

# Referee’s Notes

Initially, this adventure may come across as a simple mystery to be solved. However, it will soon become evident that it is a much more complex situation.

It may be necessary to provide the adventurers with an incentive to want to pursue the stolen component. Possibly they have a cargo that needs to be delivered within a certain time frame, or maybe they have a rendezvous to make.

Exploring a jungle world can be a dangerous activity in itself. The adventurers need to be made aware of the dangers that they may face while travelling across the surface of [[Tionale]]. Sufficient information is provided on the indigenous animal life that could be extrapolated to turn exploring the surface into a larger activity. Maybe the adventurers could be contracted by the locals to help tame the nearby wilderness, allowing for an expansion of the settlement.

The [[Sixes]] are an interesting species, and the interactions between the native sophonts and the colony is a major point of conflict for [[Tionale]]. The colony is almost at the stage of hiring mercenaries to deal with the indigenous population, due to the number of attacks that have occurred. This goes beyond the scope of this adventure but could easily be turned into a mini-campaign. Part of the reason behind the hostility of the Sixes is the attempts by the colonists to change the planetary environment, and this will prove to be a difficult area to reach a compromise on, if the adventurers try to broker any form of long term peace between the colony and the Sixes.

The presence of a [[Zhodani]] scout on [[Tionale]] should send alarm bells ringing for any ex-Imperial military personnel. Although [[Tionale]] is within the [[Demilitarized Independent Region|DIR]], it is still an Imperial dependent. What were the [[Zhodani]] trying to do on [[Tionale]]? If the scout had not crashed, what was his mission? 

The declaration of the official outbreak of the [[Fifth Frontier War]] is on 187-1107, only 133 days after the date for this adventure starting. Was the scout on a mission to determine the strength of Imperial forces in the [[Vilis subsector]]? Will the adventurers find themselves drawn into the coming conflict? 

The ability of the scout to implant false memories makes for an interesting final confrontation. It is possibly for the adventurers to fight the scout but not be aware that the entire battle is only in their heads. The realization of this only comes once they have returned to [[Tionale#D’unsin City|D’unsin Starport]]. What other memories has the scout potentially tampered with? 

Although combat can be a way to resolve most of the situations that the adventurers will encounter in this adventure, it is most definitely not the best approach to take. The indigenous wildlife is tough, and the Sixes are exceptionally challenging to fight directly, even with the advantages of advanced weaponry. The adventurers will quickly find out that these situations can turn deadly for them rapidly. Encourage the adventurers to seek other means of dealing with the various encounters they will have. This will make for a more enriching experience for them, and will ensure that they have the best chance for survival.

This adventure could lead into [[The Phlume Triangle]].
