**Tinea-Fabre** is a low-population world with a population of less than 10,000 sophonts in size.

- This world has yet to take off economically or otherwise and the population remains low for reasons largely unknown.
- It is a member of the [[Imperium|Third Imperium]] in the [[Perite Subsector]] of [[[[Core sector]] ]] in the [[Domain of Sylea]]

## Description (Planetology)

**Gisid**, as it was formerly known, is the semi-private "outback world" of [[Duke Ernst Vohdk Okhotnikov]]from [[Alekvadin]]

- The 70 or so constant residents are free to govern themselves as they please between the duke's visits.  At any time, there may be up to 200 residents, but the 70 permanent ones are the only ones with governing autonomy.
