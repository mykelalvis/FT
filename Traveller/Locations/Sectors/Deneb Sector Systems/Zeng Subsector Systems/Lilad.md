### LILAD

Like Dawn, Lilad is a system of bodies rather than a single planet. The largest moon of a gas giant, Lilad is the capital of its local moon system. The system has a total population of around 80 billion, of whom more than half live on Lilad itself.

Although cold, Lilad is habitable and has a modest native ecosystem supplemented by a few imported species. Lilad is able to grow enough food locally to supply its own population and that of the other moons, although this leads to a repetitive diet composed mainly of cereals and yeast extracts. Food is a sought-after import item, particularly fruit. Even dried and preserved fruits are popular so long as they are strongly flavored and somewhere close to 'authentic' in taste.

The Lilad Group, as the moon system is officially named, does not have a central highport as such. Each of the moons has its own small port, with a large but rather basic commercial docking facility orbiting over Lilad itself. Shuttles and small craft flit back and forth between these installations, protected by a large force of fighters and armed small craft, backed up by missile-armed defence bases on the surface of the primary moons and many other smaller, uninhabited bodies.

The system defence flotilla at Lilad is adept at hiding among the many moons and ring-system debris and in the upper atmosphere of the gas giant. The favored method of dealing with intruders is a time-on-target missile salvo from several points, though the tactic of using missiles to chase a target into a close-range torpedo ambush is also practiced. The occasional corsair does try his luck, but the Lilad Group is an unhealthy place to operate and most smart raiders know it.
