Lying close to the Mora subsector, the longest-developed part of [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]], and also the established industries of Deneb, Rhylanor is a prosperous area that sees a considerable amount of commercial traffic. One reason for this is that every world in the subsector is on the Spinward Main or accessible from it using a jump-2 vessel. Indeed, a jump-2 ship can leave [[Belizo]] and  make a circuit through the [[Mora Subsector|Mora]], [[Lunion Subsector|Lunion]] and [[Lanth subsector]]s, all the way through to [[Celepina]] before crossing back to [[Belizo]] via [[Jae Tellona]].

Rhylanor has a long naval connection and was the birthplace of [[Admiral Olav hault-Plankwell]], victor of the [[First Frontier War]] and instigator of the [[Civil War]].

Unusually, the [[Spinward Marches]] does not have a system named Depot like most [[Imperium]]-dominated sectors. [[Macene]] is the largest and most important naval base in the sector and may eventually be expanded to a full Imperial Navy depot. At that time the name may or may not be changed.

The subsector is defended by the 23rd Fleet based out of [[Rhylanor]], [[Jae Tellona]], [[Macene]], [[Margesi]] and [[Nutema]] naval bases, and there are heavy elements of the Sector Fleet including several BatRons and CruRons held in reserve at [[Macene]].

Rhylanor subsector has a number of corporate bases, notably at [[Rhylanor]] itself. These include shipyards and manufacturing centres as well as research installations. The [[Imperium]] maintains a research station
(designated Gamma) at [[Vanejen]], located in a remote area of the planet.

There are three [[Red Zone]]s: [[Gerome]], [[Huderu]] and [[457-973]]. Conspiracy theorists keep trying to link the latter with the research station at [[Vanejen]] but this seems unlikely as the [[Imperium]] would place its station at a location within the interdicted system if there were something needing to be studied.

[[Kegena]] is currently [[Amber Zone]]d. This low-tech world recently suffered a major social upheaval and governmental collapse. A temporary administration is now in place courtesy of the [[Colonial Office]], and backed up by the [[Imperial Army|Army]], but the situation remains volatile and caution is advised.

The atmosphere of [[Pannet]] makes it hazardous to visit but contains a number of useful compounds, which are extracted for use by heavy industry. Several companies offer very good wages for hostile-environment qualified personnel to work in the extraction process.

The belt at [[Gitosy]] is unusual in that it is spherical; the orbits of the asteroids that make up the belt are not confined to the ecliptic but proceed at all angles. However, most are ice fragments and potentially habitable rocky asteroids are mainly found in the ecliptic plane or in only slightly eccentric orbits.

### GILEDEN
Gileden is a rather peculiar little world, with a denser atmosphere than its low surface gravity might normally produce. This has not prevented the world from taking a pounding in the past, with extensive evidence of asteroid impacts in its distant past. There are those who claim that the world was given its dense atmosphere by the Ancients and then bombarded in their Final War, yet the impacts vastly predate any known starfaring species.

The mystery is compounded by the composition of the asteroids; the impact craters are still very obvious and their centres tend to have high concentrations of unusual minerals. It is possible that the bodies that made these craters came from outside the Gileden system, although how that might come to pass is unknown. A wild tale surfaced some years ago about part of an extremely old sublight colony ship – carved out of an asteroid – which was found in deep space near Gileden.

Gileden is home to a handful of 'official' residents, mostly starport workers who decided to stay permanently and changed their citizenship. Much larger numbers of personnel work on Gileden but do not call it home.  Some work the port, some are scientists studying the impact sites or unusual atmosphere conditions, and some are prospectors hoping to make a big strike in one of the craters.

### RHYLANOR
Rhylanor is a small world with a very thin atmosphere located in a cluster of three star systems just off the Spinward Main. As such, it provides a useful short cut for high-jump vessels and x-boats but is somewhat inaccessible to commercial ships. The majority of traffic into Rhylanor comes via the Celepina-Jae Tellona link or from Fulacin to Porozlo. Access to the subsector capital was one reason for the construction of an excellent Class A starport at the otherwise unimportant world of Fulacin.

Rhylanor is home to several billion people, mostly human, and has a moderate society with liberal laws.
Entry to the world's ruling elite by those not born to the right families is not easy but it is possible to join the ruling class by a variety of methods, the most common through power and achievement.

Elevation through power is simply a recognition of the influence an individual already wields. Usually this means business interests, ownership of industrial assets and the like but in some cases individuals who have risen to lead political or social groups have been elevated to the ruling class. There are those who suggest that rising political stars, who might challenge the establishment are encouraged to sell out and join the existing system; others maintain that Rhylanor is a meritocracy where those who deserve a say in government are given it.

Elevation for achievement is generally linked with service to the [[Imperium]] or Rhylanor's armed forces.
Retired naval, marine and army officers are frequently offered generous inducements to take up government posts or simply be associated with the government as advisors and public supporters. Achievements in other areas, such as science or entertainment, are also rewarded in this way, ensuring that Rhylanor attracts the best and brightest.

Rhylanor's most famous citizen was Grand Admiral Olav hault-Plankwell, who not only defeated the Outworld Coalition in the First Frontier War but advanced on [[Capital]] and took the throne for himself. This is sometimes described as the ultimate expression of Rhylanor-style meritocracy. Plankwell had achieved great things as a naval officer and wielded great power, fulfilling both requirements for elevation, and deserved to be made part of the ruling elite, perhaps as Archduke of the Domain of Deneb. Empress Jacqueline was foolish not to reward Plankwell's greatness and paid the price when he took what he deserved by his own efforts.  Reminders that Plankwell did not manage to keep his position very long do not go down well on Rhylanor.

Admiral Plankwell's birthplace is now a small museum, which attracts large numbers of visitors every year.
This is only one of Rhylanor's many naval connections; although Macene is home to the heavy units of the Sector Fleet based in the subsector, the subsector fleet itself (the 23rd) has its headquarters at Rhylanor and there is a very powerful system squadron. Rhylanor also boasts a large naval academy where young officers-to-be undergo education and training.

One of the proud traditions of the Rhylanor Naval Academy is the 'manning the boats' ceremony held just before graduation of each class of cadets, commemorating the contribution of trainee personnel from the academy to the defence of Rhylanor in the Third Frontier War. Cadets volunteered in huge numbers to crew repaired and reactivated system defence boats from the system's reserve fleet during the Siege of Rhylanor. Casualties were very high in the dark months of the middle of 981 before the siege was finally broken.
The ceremony is held in memory of their sacrifice and as a reminder to cadets that they have not chosen a cosy, safe occupation.

Rhylanor also has a large Scout Service base, which acts as a communications depot for x-boat routes as well as a regional planning and command center. The facility is extensive and contains training facilities for some of the more specialized scout roles such as the use of advanced communications equipment and the security teams occasionally called upon to rescue personnel who have found more trouble than they can handle.

Rhylanor, with its large population base and extremely high Tech Level, is also a center for industry, commerce and education. The Rhylanor Institute of Technology is one of the most prominent hard-science and technological-research institutions in the entire [[Imperium]] and almost certainly the foremost facility this side of Corridor.

Several megacorporations have their regional headquarters on Rhylanor or at least a major installation for those who prefer to work out of Mora. Some of Rhylanor's extensive shipyards are privately owned but most are either megacorporate subsidiaries or partially funded by their money.

Rhylanor's importance as a communications hub and industrial center cannot offset the fact that it is difficult to get to. Free traders and similar independent starships are rarely seen in the ports of Rhylanor, Porozlo and Jae Tellona; they tend to stay on the Spinward Main.
The vessels that do come through are for the most part expensive jump-3 liners and freighters running through Eqqus, Celepina and Belizo.

Many of the ships on this route are megacorporate-owned, although a couple of smaller lines make a decent profit from dedicated vessels plying the trans-Rhylanor routes. The most prominent, Rhylanor Shipping LIC, is heavily subsidized by the government to ensure a regular service. The firm does not operate anywhere else but | | [[Imperium]] Mail LIC does, specialising in high-jump courier and subsidized trade route operations in various parts of [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]], as well as Deneb.
