# JOYEUSE

Named for the legendary sword of Charlemagne, which changed colour 30 times a day, Joyeuse has a standard atmosphere and 40% hydrographics. At first glance it might seem a good prospect for colonization but the numbers are deceptive. Joyeuse rotates slowly and has a year just 12 of its days long. As a result, it suffers extremes of heat and cold, with 12 days of darkness followed by 12 days of constant sunlight. Combined with a variety of fungal blights that cripple flowering plants of most species, this makes conventional agriculture difficult. In addition to producing a number of fungal foodstuffs, Joyeuse has an extensive ranching industry adapted to local conditions.

The 40 million or so inhabitants are dispersed in small to modest-sized towns, with few major population centres and therefore little in the way of economic or industrial efficiency. The largest city is Tholasborg, with a population of around 250,000. Despite this, Joyeuse manages to maintain a heavily decentralised TL10 industrial base, with the capability to build military starships and field an effective ground force.

The planetary navy of Joyeuse is based at Thoslinn, the next planet out from Joyeuse. Thoslinn is also the main naval base for the [[Sword Worlds Confederation]] as a whole, although the size of forces based there depends on internal and external politics. The base has extensive training facilities, including a collection of non-Sword Worlds vessels maintained ostensibly for familiarization purposes. It has been suggested that these vessels might also be used to train personnel to hijack or attack them, or even act as a Trojan horse in covert intelligence-gathering operations.
