# Trake

Small berry common to many worlds of the [[Imperium]]. The trake has a meaty, sweet body enclosing a single large seed and grows on a low, thorny bush. Trakes have been grown in the lmperial core since the time of the First Imperium. Introduced late to the [[Spinward Marches]], they have flourished on only a few worlds. notably Pysadi and [[Alell]], although they are cultivated on many others. See also [[Atrake]].
