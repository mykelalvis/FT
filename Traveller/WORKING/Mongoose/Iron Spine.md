Rimward Void Adventure 2

# Introduction

_Iron Spine_ is part two of a two-part adventure series. You may conduct this adventure either as part and parcel of the series or as a standalone adventure. This tale takes our intrepid travellers to Yero'ilra, deep into the realm of the hostile Glorious Empire.

There are many reasons to adventure into the Glorious Empire, but the obvious one is none other than the Aslan who live there. They're big. They're mean. They're the most _Aslan_ of all Aslan! The Glorious Empire is like a dying predator, cornered in a cave, prepared to strike at all comers with its nasty bite. Unlike the rest of the Trojan Reach Aslan, the Empire has not given up the practice of slavery. This makes them a pariah. They're hostile to virtually all of the human systems in the Outrim Void, and relations with their Aslan brethren in the Yásoisthea are tense at best. Yet they refuse to change their ways. With such a lovely, pleasant, and progressive culture, who _wouldn't_ want to go there for a visit?!

This adventure presents the story as if you are proceeding from part one of the series, [[The TkTk Convergence]]. At the conclusion of that story, the Aslan of the Yetrai clan have taken dozens of slaves from an archaeological dig site on Tktk. The human captives have been placed into low berths aboard a _Hkisyeleaa_ - class slaver for the journey back to Yero'ilra. A hundred or more tktks (the Chirper subspecies that calls the eponymously named planet Tktk their home) have also been captured.

The enslaved humans have been put to work in mining or research enterprises. In one highly classified project, several of them are developing a way to extract mineral resources from Htirlaosea, an outer zone world of the Yero'ilra system heretofore inaccessible due to solar flares from one of the system's red dwarf companions.

The Yetrai clan has many plans for their captives. As “preferred status” slaves, the academics are treated better than most. They are given superior food, lodging, and incentives to produce solutions to some of the clan's biggest problems. Their slavery will seem a bit more like indentured servitude than hard labor.

The fate of the tktks is much worse. They are assigned to a variety of tasks including menial labor and mining. Many have been sold as pets for Aslan children.

If you ran “The Tktk Convergence” before this adventure, one or more of the travellers might have been captured as well. If only some of the travellers were captured, this presents a refereeing challenge, essentially forcing you to conduct two stories at once. If this is the case, fear not! The story will reunite your disjointed traveller groups in due time and there are always ways to cut corners to get them back together sooner if need be.

If you are not conducting Iron Spine as a continuation from The Tktk Convergence, there are a number of ways you can draw the travellers into the story. For example:

- While travelling the Sindalian Main, one of the travellers might find out that allies or contacts were among a group of captured slaves. They might feel compelled to aid them.
- Several important academics were among the captives. Perhaps a consortium of university and/or corporate interests wants to hire the travellers as a mercenary force to free them.
- Perhaps one or more of the travellers has had run-ins with the Aslan before and the story of the captured humans compels them to get involved.

The possibilities are virtually endless.

## Getting In
![[IrnSpn-378.jpg|100]]
[[IrnSpn-378.jpg|Partial Sector Map]]

Jumping into Yero'ilra system and using its outer zone gas giants for refueling is not an issue. The vassal clans that control the system have little interest in prohibiting wilderness refueling. Aslan, as a general rule, do not consider the space between planets to be owned by anyone; however, an unauthorized starship that wanders close to Yero'ilra or other inhabited planetary bodies in the system can expect a hostile response.

The vassal clans of Yero'ilra do not have large capital ships. When such ships are present, it's usually because a visiting dignitary from the Tokoueáwe clan navy is present from Syoakh or one of the other more powerful systems in the Glorious Empire.

Yero'ilra has a large system defense fleet, most of which are in the 50-1,000 tonne range with a few destroyers of 3,000-5,000 tonnes. In addition, the planet is defended by orbital and ground-based missile batteries.

Yero'ilra is effectively an interdicted system with clearance to land granted only to the vassal clans, the Tokoueáwe, and a few Aslan trade corporations (primarily Glories Under The Claw) that have been granted docking privileges.

The travellers can get to Yero'ilra a number of ways, limited only by the imaginations of the referee and travellers. For expediency's sake, here are some suggestions:

- They can jump into the system on their own, be threatened with vaporization by fighters and SDBs, and taken prisoner or destroyed. Not the best approach but it will get them there even if their ship is immediately impounded and their lives forfeit.
- Get captured as a slave in one of the local systems that Yero'ilra raids. Again, not ideal, but it certainly puts them into the thick of things, especially if they are technically skilled.
- Stow away aboard an Aslan freighter bound for Yero'ilra. Doable but risky.
- Develop a relationship with an Aslan merchant, diplomat, or other agency that's going to Yero'ilra and arrange to be part of their flotilla.

The first three aren't very good ideas if the travellers value their health or future prospects, but if they choose one of these methods or something similar, make it interesting. The most hare-brained plans sometimes work, but the odds of their success are greatly reduced.

The fourth option, or some variation thereof, is probably the best way to go. The ideal system to find willing accomplices would be Hliyh (1323 B200AB7-E), but any nearby non-Glorious Empire system will do. Most of the systems in the Hierate are on neutral or friendly terms with humans, frequently engaging in trade and diplomacy with them, so incorporating human guests is not out of the question.

Once in a friendly Aslan system, the travellers will have to initiate contact with an Aslan group that is going to Yero'ilra. To find an Aslan starship or flotilla that's going to Yero'ilra: make an Average (8+) Streetwise check (1D hours, INT or SOC).

Once they find an Aslan group that matches their parameters, they must find a way to join them. Most Aslan ship captains have no desire to hire human crew. They have plenty of labor options and would probably resort to robots before hiring humans for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that Aslan user interfaces are not compatible with human hands.

However, an Aslan merchant might be convinced to bring a human trader or other ship along as a freighter, carrying extra goods for them on a large supply run. A diplomat might have personnel who need passage.

The travellers might present themselves as traders or envoys who have business to conduct in the Glorious Empire (however unlikely that might be) and would like safe passage with a flotilla of Aslan starships.

How the travellers get into the Glorious Empire is up to them and you. It depends on the type of campaign you are running and the creativity of the travellers.

If the travellers do not have a starship of their own, you might have to make an exception to the “no human employees on Aslan starships” rule.

After finding the right group, the travellers must convince the Aslan to take them along: make a Very Difficult (12+) Diplomacy or Persuasion check (1D minutes, INT or SOC). Reduce the task difficulty to Difficult (10+) if they speak Trokh.

Chances are the travellers are going to fail one or more times. Finding willing accomplices might seem overly difficult, but it _should_ be. The Glorious Empire is as xenophobic as they come and finding a Hierate Aslan willing to risk a voyage into the Empire with humans, Vargr, or other species in tow is not going to be easy.

Even so, Hliyh is a high-population world. There should be no shortage of Aslan ships to whom the travellers can petition. Most experienced Aslan captains know that escorting a human ship into Yero'ilra or taking humans along as passengers is asking for trouble; however, if the travellers keep plugging away, they'll eventually find a group willing to risk it.

If they manage to “hook their wagon” to a trade mission, they might be able to make some money in the process. How much they make depends in part on how they present themselves to their would-be partners, and how effective they are at negotiation.

If they approach the Aslan expressing a need to get to Yero'ilra, the Aslan broker (a female) might sense their urgency and recognize that they can get the humans to go along without paying them or possibly even _charge the travellers_ for the privilege.

On the other hand, if the travellers play their cards right and they're patient, they'll find an Aslan merchant with a need for assistance. They might even make a tidy profit enroute to Yero'ilra.

To hire on as a freighter with an Aslan flotilla: Difficult (10+) Diplomacy or Broker check (3D minutes, SOC). Reduce the difficulty to Average (8+) if they speak Trokh.

How much they get paid depends on the Effect of their check:

0-3 The Aslan broker “smells” their desperation and charges them a 25% premium to join the flotilla. The travellers receive 0.75 x standard freight fees. 
4-5 The Aslan graciously accept the humans' assistance as a small freighter. They will be paid standard freight fees. 
6+ Same as above, but they receive 1.1 x standard freight fees and the captain says he'll help them with the local brokers if they like so they can obtain speculative cargo from otherwise xenophobic and uncooperative suppliers.

If the travellers succeed at convincing an Aslan captain to let them come along but fail to hire on as a freighter, expect the Aslan purser to charge the travellers a tidy sum for the privilege of joining their flotilla. If this is undesirable to the travellers, they can always start at square one and find a different patron.

# Planetfall: Yero'ilra

Landing on Yero'ilra is a formidable undertaking even if the travellers enlist a reputable Aslan merchant or diplomat to help them get there. Unless they have managed to make the trip as passengers aboard an Aslan ship, they can expect to receive a rude welcome.

A few minutes after coming out of jump, they are targeted by system defense boats. The SDBs have identified the travellers' ship as a human one (unless they have somehow procured an Aslan ship for the journey). They notice that the Aslan ships in the flotilla are not subjected to the same aggression. This is basically a case of racial profiling in space. Make it tense, but after they either talk down the SDBs or have their Aslan comrades do it for them, calmer heads prevail and no shots are fired. One possible hitch: The SDB captains only speak Trokh.

The travellers' ship is subjected to a highly invasive inspection that takes approximately three hours. If one or more of them speaks Trokh, they can reduce the time to one hour with a successful Difficult (10+) Persuasion or Diplomat check (SOC). If the inspection goes through as planned, the travellers will be stripped of any weapons and armor that they have not hidden.

Landing at the downport, they feel the seething xenophobia of the Glorious Empire. They do not see humans as worthy of respect or even acknowledgement. After the travellers are permitted to offload their freight, they quickly discover that they are personae non grata. There are many other humans about, but they are virtually all slaves. In effect, the travellers (the non-Aslan among them, anyway) are viewed as “freed slaves” on a planet that hasn't emancipated their own.

# Yero'ilra DOWNPORT

Once they arrive, the travellers are subjected to dirty looks, uttered curses, and personal slights too numerous to mention. They are strangers in a strange land, and their hosts are very inhospitable.

After receiving their disbursement for any freight or passengers that they have brought to the planet, the receiving clerk asks them in Trokh or deeply accented Galanglic, “So where are you jumping to now?” with the implication being that they couldn't possibly be staying in system. The question isn't meant to intimidate. It is merely an indication of how racially and culturally unwelcome non-Aslan are. The clerk cannot imagine why they would stay on planet for longer than a day.

If they ask for help, at least one or two members of the ship or flotilla they jumped into the system with might serve as guides in the startown. If they're lucky, their Aslan cohorts might even be willing to take them to the capital city, Ayekhe, if the travellers request it. They should note that this is no small act of kindness. They are essentially sacrificing the good will of their species by accompanying the humans.

It might seem odd that their Aslan cohorts would be willing to assist the travellers, but despite appearances, most Trojan Reach Aslan are quite cosmopolitan. They frown upon the racial prejudice exhibited by the Glorious Empire and some might even relish the opportunity to flout their racist, slave-owning cousins. Conflict and assertion of one's will are key tenets of Aslan culture. For the Aslan who came to Yero'ilra with the travellers, this scenario might present an opportunity to exercise what they believe to be their cultural superiority.

## Unwelcome Feeling

During their time on Yero'ilra, the travellers can engage in the same activities they would on any other planet; however, they will suffer anti-human prejudice and might be the victims of petty or violent crime. They are a minority on Yero'ilra and a despised one at that.

A visit to the starport bar might result in a challenge from a drunken Aslan (or perhaps even a duel). An attempt to work with local brokers to obtain speculative cargo could be fraught with challenges and serve as an opportunity to break through the barriers of racial prejudice, but breaking the ice will be challenging.

Taking public transit is allowed, but the dismissive glances and the curious gaze of Aslan citizens and their children might grate on the travellers. Visiting a city on such a foreign and uninviting planet should be an experience unto itself.

Despite some of the uncomfortable encounters the travellers have, most of the locals do not taunt or provoke them. They are not accustomed to seeing free humans and rather than wanting to somehow enslave or confront the travellers, most Yero'ilran Aslan would rather just ignore them.

The one way the travellers can ameliorate the situation is by trying to blend in as slaves. Wear dirty clothing. Obtain a miner's uniform. Appear unkempt and destitute. If they decide to carry weapons, it is essential that they conceal them. Appearing to be slaves will enable the travellers to blend into their environment.

## Human Slavery in the Glorious Empire

The treatment of human slaves varies from system to system in the Glorious Empire. The travellers' imaginations might conjure images of their human brethren in chains, receiving corporal punishment and humiliation at every turn. They do witness incidents that substantiate these notions, but the more variegated reality might surprise them.

Some humans in the Empire do experience a brutal existence, but most merely live out their lives as the designated underclass, not chattel slaves. Humans live a meager existence and are virtually incapable of rising in societal ranks (though a few have modestly improved their lot in life, as shall be seen) but most have some degree of choice in what they do for a living.

There are many jobs available to slaves in Empire society and most humans are free to pursue these vocations as they see fit. Mining is by far the most common work for humans on Yero'ilra, but they also serve as unskilled laborers, teamsters, household servants, janitorial workers, and in other jobs that are considered the bottom rung of the employment ladder.

Even on high-tech worlds that might otherwise use robots for menial tasks, the Aslan like to employ manual labor. Domination and control are important to the Aslan male and flouting power over subordinates is desirable to them. Being in a position of ownership and authority is what they're all about.

Once human slaves have been selected for a job, they have limited mobility. They may only leave a job when given permission to do so, effectively making them the property of a given clan for the duration of employment. Typically, jobs have a limited duration and a slave will eventually be out of work and looking for their next gig; however, some jobs provide lifetime employment... whether the slave wants it or not.

Humans live mostly in squalor. Slave labor does not pay in any form of recognized currency; rather, each slave vocation grants certain forms of access to staples and basic goods. Miners have access to rations, work clothes, and dormitories; hospitality jobs grant boons of textiles, leftover food stocks, residence in the slave quarters, and so forth. One must not forget that Aslan males do not engage in monetary exchange, so it is virtually unheard of for the concept to matriculate to slave populations. Barter and charity are the most slaves can hope for.

To the visiting traveller, the mildly liberated appearance of many human slaves is an illusion that is dispelled from time to time. There's nothing to stop an Aslan from brushing aside, physically abusing, or even killing slaves in most cases. If any retribution for such acts occurs, it's more out of concern that “property” was damaged than it is for the rights of fellow sentient beings. Restitution for a slain human slave is more likely to be a monetary exchange between Aslan _ekhos_ (families) than any form of criminal justice.

Slaves in the Glorious Empire speak a pidgin version of Trokh which includes many humanocentric slang words. Members of the resistance have managed to acquire Galanglic language training texts on the black market. Speaking Galanglic is a form of passive resistance and a way to codify communication. Most Aslan in the Empire do not speak or understand human languages.

Humans in Empire society know their limitations. Centuries of subjugation have been etched into their collective psyche. While many have the vague notion that humans in other systems live free lives, and some even know of the Imperium, the Zhodani Consulate, and other human governments, only a select few have any notion of being on an even keel with the Aslan and even fewer have ever found a way to escape their bondage.

A very select group of humans have ascended to positions of authority in Aslan society. These humans are known in Trokh as the saihlea. The authority of the saihlea is limited to other humans. You will never see a human in charge of an Aslan, even an outcast. As such, their reach stops abruptly at the upper extent of slavedom.

The saihlea are used by the Aslan as a communication channel to the human slave population. These emissaries are both admired and reviled by their subordinates. Some humans are happy to have leaders who can help resolve conflicts and curry favor with their Aslan betters. Others despise them for their obsequiousness and adulation of the Aslan. The latter see the saihlea as complicit in their suffering and would sooner see them experience an airlock accident or crushed by a falling crane than they would bow to their authority. For this reason, it is common for saihlea to have a security entourage, a small group of lightly armed humans (usually carrying cudgels or small blades) dedicated to their defense.

> [!info]- Dreams of Sanctuary
> While the Glorious Empire does a pretty good job of squelching dissent and limiting the flow of information to the slave population, a growing number of slaves know the story of Tryaoke (1524 D556978-8), a system populated by billions of former human slaves who were liberated by the Hierate when they took the system from the Glorious Empire several decades ago.
> 
> Despite the desperate reality of life on the planet, Tryaoke has become a beacon of hope for many human slaves. The system has acquired an almost mythical status among the slave resistance.

> Tryaoke's main sequence star, quite bright in Yero'ilra's sky due to its proximity, is part of a constellation the Aslan call “The Noose.” Human slaves refer to the constellation as “The Ring.” Resistance members have created a symbol intended to represent the Ring that looks very much like an inverted Imperial sunburst.


## Vive la Résistance!

After the travellers get settled and engage in a few activities, they are noticed by members of the human resistance.

Despite their enslavement, some humans have developed the will to resist and many dream of a future in which the Aslan are overthrown. Some are even aware that their masters are clinging desperately to the vestiges of a dying empire.

The resistance engages in a range of activities including sabotage, terrorism, organized crime, assassination, and guerrilla warfare.

When a resistance cell is discovered, the Aslan respond with great brutality and efficiency. Extra- judicial soldiers (“death squads” by another name) are usually dispatched to round up and execute resistance fighters, often after interrogating or torturing them. For this reason, many in the resistance keep some type of poison or a small blade handy to commit suicide rather than be subjected to such horrors.

Khahei Ohmelig, a member of the resistance, eventually contacts the travellers. If the travellers actively search for a contact among the slave population, you may optionally have them find him. Ohmelig wants information and weapons that will aid the cause. In return, he will provide information about the whereabouts of their captured friends.

Ohmelig can help the travellers cut corners in their search. As a teamster for the port authority, he is privy to a great deal of information pertaining to incoming cargo, freight, and slaves. He knows where the majority of the tktks have been distributed and he knows where the Yero'ilran contingent of the humans are. He does not know the location of the second human group, but he knows that they were assigned to a secret project.

In return for this information, he's going to expect something from the travellers. Information is valuable, but ultimately, he's going to want materials that will help the resistance. Weapons, explosives, armor. Something that directly aids their cause.


> [!note] Referee's Note

> Rather, they are primarily trained to quash rebellion in all forms with brutal, physical response. They are riot police first and foremost.

> As long as the travellers stay out of trouble, they will only be subjected to a little harassment and racial profiling.

# Where the Captives Are

Unfortunately for the travellers, their enslaved friends have been distributed widely around the Yero'ilra system. Reacquiring all of them is going to be a tall order. Following are summaries of each captive group and where they have been taken.

## The Tktks

Woe are the tktks. The hundreds of tktks that were captured have been spread far and wide. Liberating them all will be nigh impossible. About a third have been distributed to the noble households as light servantry. Another third have been sent to work in the mines. The final third have or will become pets.

The tktks distributed to the noble households are virtually impossible to recover. They have been distributed across the planet and are serving on the many estates of the clans that run the system. Taking them by force is a suicide mission. The houses are well defended and the travellers are in enemy territory.

The tktks in the mines are another story. Most of them have been taken to the gold and tungsten mine northwest of Ayekhe (refer to the map in "Library Data" on page 15). The mine has many tight spaces where the Aslan deemed the tktks would be useful. Getting into the mine will be difficult. Security is tight. If they take it upon themselves to do so, they could launch an assault on the mine and free a large number of tktks.

An assault on a mine is an assault on Yero'ilra's economy, and the Aslan won't take it lightly. The travellers will become public enemy number one, and it might behoove them to get off the planet immediately after conducting such a raid.

The third group of tktks will be equally difficult to recover. After their arrival, they have become a popular acquisition as pets for Aslan children. You might say there's been a bit of a tktk sensation on Yero'ilra. Two thirds of the original stock have been sold, but the remaining third are being held at a warehouse in Ayekhe. It's on the outskirts of the city, has no armed guards, and the only impediment is the security system, which a technically trained traveller could circumvent with Electronics (Computers) or possibly Mechanic skill.

If they attempt to break them out without disabling the security systems, the hunters will become the hunted. The Aslan put the pieces together quickly and at that point, the travellers will need to get offworld. If they do manage to disable the security equipment, liberate the tktks, and find a way to successfully get them back to their starship, they might very well do so without incurring the wrath of the Aslan. Quite simply, it's the best chance they have of freeing a large number of them without consequences.

To summarize, rescuing the tktks from either of the above locations will result in the travellers being hunted. If they hope to free the tktks, they will have to either coordinate their operations or experience increasingly greater risk with each successive “jailbreak.”

## The Scientists and Researchers

The academics that were lured to Tktk and enslaved by the Aslan have been assigned to two tasks:

- Serving as Ancients researchers at the museum of antiquities in Ayekhe. Their primary task is to evaluate artifacts that the Empire has obtained over time to determine if they can be used as weapons or trade bait. This team is comprised of about six individuals, including Dr. [[Bledsoe]] of “The Tktk Convergence” fame.
- The geologists, archaeologists, robotocists, and planetologists have all been taken to Htirlaosea, a mineral-rich world that orbits companion star, Oúolaoeis, a temperamental red dwarf that bathes the system in electromagnetic radiation. This team, of 20 individuals has been tasked with developing a means to exploit the planet's riches.

# Night at the Museum

When the travellers go to rescue the scientists at the museum, Dr. [[Bledsoe]] is extremely relieved to see them.
“How on the Emperor's black and pearly tableau have you come to be here?!” she asks them.

While she admits that the Aslan have treated them more as guests than slaves, their freedom of movement is limited. It has also been made clear that a great deal is expected of them.

The Glorious Empire has an acute dearth of scientific and technical personnel, and their “investment” in slaves with such talent is important to them. They do not threaten their captives, but there it is implied that they had better be productive...or else!

Dr. [[Bledsoe]] and her team live in a spartan dormitory that is attached to the museum. The museum itself is secure, but the travellers, using their technical skills, should be able to circumvent the security systems.

Alternatively, the travellers could pose as foreign dignitaries who are visiting the planet or come up with any number of other methods to get into the museum and establish contact with the scientists.

Getting out of the museum itself will not pose a problem, but navigating the city and finding a way back to their starship could prove challenging. The travellers will have to be extremely creative to ensure that they make a clean escape.

They will have a few unexpected assets that might help. Dr. [[Bledsoe]] has identified three artifacts that they can use during their escape:

- A time tripper: a small, handheld device that appears to have limited charges ([[Bledsoe]] believes it has three charges left based on her interpretation of its instrument panel) and grants the user the ability to advance time approximately 20 seconds. During the time lapse, the individual can do anything desired with his person or with objects in his possession. An energy bubble appears around the bearer, preventing contact with all outside objects above the atomic level. It also seems to limit the bearer to approximately walking speed. One user attempted to run while in the bubble and his leg was atomized and cauterized in the process. Use with caution.
- A nutrients assembly device: This toaster-sized object appears to be made of shiny white plastic. After the user activates it by manipulating a few dials and buttons (Dr. [[Bledsoe]] believes she has figured out the correct sequence), it evaluates the user's current needs and provides a synthetic meal that is nutritious, delicious, and fulfilling. Yum! It has an unknown number of charges and the instrument panel is thus far ambiguous to the research team.
- A nuclear grenade: Yes, you read that right. The third artifact, a small gray globe with what appears to be a “happy face” logo on its surface, is a small thermonuclear device. If it is similar to other devices Dr. [[Bledsoe]] has seen, you activate it by tracing certain characters from the Ancients' alphabet on its rear surface. The character you “inscribe” determines the power of the explosion. Once activated, it creates a 5-meter wide shield around the source area of the thrower that is protected from the explosion. If the device is similar to the other ones Dr. [[Bledsoe]] has read about, its explosive capacity is enough to destroy several city blocks when set to maximum power.

Dr. [[Bledsoe]] emphasizes that each of these devices are to be used with extreme caution, but she agrees that if they aid their escape, it's worth the risk. She and her team do not relish the idea of being enslaved for the rest of their lives.

In addition to the artifacts, the museum has an impressive array of exhibits. Ayekhe is the capital of an important Empire planet, and its exhibits are meant to show the grandeur and power of the Glorious Empire. Ancient armors and weapons, tapestries from the Hierate, and hundreds of beautiful paintings, sculptures, literary works, and other pieces of art adorn its halls. The architecture of the building is aesthetically pleasing, with the complex curvature and roundedness seen elsewhere in Aslan design from their skyscrapers to their starships. It is also quite colorful, primarily using a pleasing array of deep reds, oranges, golds, and silvers.

If they are not cautious, the rescue of the scientists in the museum dormitory will result in the alarm being sounded, much as any rescue of the tktks would. After getting the scientists out, it would behoove the travellers to get offworld as soon as possible. The Yero'ilran police and military will leave no stone unturned while trying to capture the invaders who performed the rescue.

## Altruistic Notions

Once the travellers successfully infiltrate the museum facility and free Dr. [[Bledsoe]] an the scientists on site, she insists that they also free the service personnel who served as their caretakers.

Two human females and one male were tasked with caring for the scientists. In addition to liberating them, Dr. [[Bledsoe]] requests that the travellers free their families. While it seems risky, each of the service personnel believe they can gather their closest 3‒5 family members in 30 minutes or less.

You can play the delay for suspense, with a near miss by an Aslan security patrol, or just let the 30 minutes pass by. The result is that the travellers are now responsible for not only the scientists and possibly some tktks, but also 10-12 escaped slaves. If the travellers care to find out, have them attempt a Difficult (10+) Advocate (EDU) check. Reduce it to Average if the player checking speaks Trokh. The end result is the discovery that free slaves is punishable by summary execution.

# Ace in the Hole: The Yetrai Clan?!

If Ferlyewá Yetrai, the patriarch of the Yetrai clan, survived “The Tktk Convergence,” he will play a part in this adventure as well. If he did not survive, his wife Ahfoisa almost certainly still did, and her eldest son, Faakea, is now head of the clan.

Ahfoisa will take notice after one or more slave groups have been liberated by the travellers. She keeps a close eye on clan affairs, and the link between two such events will appear suspicious to her.

Ferlyewá (or Faakea as the case may be) is momentarily distracted by a war of assassins. The Yetrai are being challenged by another vassal clan, the Kheastoitastya, for dominance of the Yero'ilra system. So far, the war has resulted in the deaths of several minor to middling males in each clan's hierarchy.

Unfortunately for the Kheastoitastya, Faakea is a master assassin and has single handedly eliminated several low-level functionaries of the Kheastoitastya clan, including the clan patriarch's two bodyguards.

While most of a war of assassins is conducted behind the scenes and is therefore invisible to the general public, the travellers see at least one incident related to the ongoing power struggle. This could be the dead bodies of the bodyguards found in an alley or if you really want to increase the stakes, one of the Kheastoitastya second sons is killed, perhaps right in front of the travellers.

In any case, once Ahfoisa gets wind of the travellers' efforts, she will take one of several actions:

- Send clan assassins after the travellers
- Send a clan strike team after the travellers
- Attempt to negotiate with the travellers

Regardless of which action she takes, she will most certainly notify them of her intentions before doing so. Despite the fact that they are humans and therefore beneath the Aslan in all ways, she will act with honor.

Her message to them will be loud and clear: the body of either Khahei Ohmelig or one of his functionaries, will be dropped in the streets for them to find with a note unceremoniously stapled to his chest. The note will indicate her intentions going forward.

Suffice it to say this ups the ante a bit for the travellers who will then know they are being pursued by highly trained soldiers or assassins in addition to any other trouble they have stirred up for themselves.

#### Parleying with Ahfoisa

The travellers' subterfuge comes at a bad time for the Yetrai. Their war of assassins has occurred just as they are on the verge of a scientific breakthrough on Htirlaosea.

After “miraculously” finding a way to exploit the mineral resources of the radiation-laden planet (for more information, see The Fox and the Grapes, below), the Yetrai had intended to curry favor with the ruling Tokouea'we clan on Syoakh, thereby increasing their standing in the Glorious Empire considerably.

Fighting both the war of assassins and dealing with the travellers stretches the Yetrai's resources dangerously thin. If the travellers were to attempt a negotiation with Ahfoisa, they might find her receptive.

When this happens is up to you. If you would like to have the travellers engage in a little combat with highly trained and well-equipped Aslan assassins, that's your prerogative. It should be a lethal encounter, but if the travellers inflict significant casualties on the Aslan, that will only increase the likelihood that Ahfoisa will want to bring the travellers to the negotiating table.

The fact is the more mayhem and destruction the travellers wreak without being captured, the more likely Ahfoisa is to make a deal with them.

Following are deals Ahfoisa is willing to make:

- She will allow the travellers to depart Yero'ilra with any slaves they have freed so far provided they do not cause any additional destruction or mayhem. They will be allowed to take their ship to jump point without interference from Yero'ilra System Defense. They are forbidden to extract the slaves from Htirlaosea as part of this bargain.
- If they have successfully freed Dr. [[Bledsoe]] and absconded with the Ancient artifacts, she will grant them the same deal as above, and also return all of the tktks that were captured (Ahfoisa's influence reaches that far!) provided they return the stolen artifacts. Recovering the tktks will take a few days, during which time, the travellers may retreat to their starship.

Under no circumstances will she grant the travellers permission to proceed to Htirlaosea to free the other 20 scientists who were taken captive. Their work on the planet is the lynchpin of the Yetrai's goals.

# The Fox and the Grapes

In Aesop's fable of the same name, there is a fox who greatly desires grapes from a particular tree. The fox cannot reach the grapes no matter how hard he tries, but rather than admit that he has failed, he proclaims that the grapes are undesirable.

On the outer-system planet Htirlaosea (the proverbial tree as it were) the Aslan are unable to reach rather impressive lodes of lanthanum, platinum, gold, and rare earth metals (You guessed it: The “grapes”) that lay buried on the bright side of the tidally locked planet.

Htirlaosea orbits the system's tempestuous red dwarf companion star, Oúolaoeis, which makes it incredibly dangerous to mount expeditions to the regions with the greatest riches. In almost taunting fashion, the dark side of the planet is mostly silicates, ice, and granite, none of which has great value in interstellar trade. The riches on the bright side are coveted by the Yetrai, but the radiation danger makes any large expedition too risky.

The fox has forsaken the grapes for many years on Htirlaosea. With limited technological and personnel resources, they have had little choice. The much more powerful Tokoueáwe clan with their resources on Syoakh and Htourlao, could extract the mineral resources from the planet with their superior technology.

The Yetrai have deemed it prudent to downplay the value of the planet. For decades they have engaged in an active program of denigrating its value, all the while desperately seeking a way to secretly extract the planet's riches for themselves.

Without much of an innovative culture, they have found it difficult to solve this problem, and they have lain their hopes on the scientists they acquired on Tktk.

The text of this adventure suggests that the scientists have helped the Aslan develop plasma boring devices, but this is really up to the referee. Perhaps they have developed superior tunneling technology that enables the Aslan to bore subterranean access to the mineral nodes. Alternatively, they might help the Aslan harden their robotics tech so that it can operate in the electromagnetically challenging environment of Htirlaosea's bright side. Perhaps they are doing all of the above and more. It's up to you.

## Considerations

To get to Htirlaosea, the travellers are going to need a ship if they do not have one already. It is possible that they might convince the Aslan who brought them into the system to help. Failing that, they're going to need to somehow borrow or steal a ship.

Oúolaoeis is constantly spewing electromagnetic radiation and poses a danger to any unshielded ship that approaches it. The travellers are unlikely to have the resources to completely shield their ship; however, a generous referee might reward their creativity if they try to find ways to temporarily shield key components.

In addition, the travellers can attempt to perform some crafty spaceflight, approaching from the dark side and using Htirlaosea's shadow to protect them to some extent. In addition to taking such precautions, they will ideally be wearing vacc suits or other radiation shielding during their approach. This will help them avoid being cooked by stellar radiation.

## Flight to Htirlaosea

If the travellers are wise, they have already refueled their ship one way or another. Getting unrefined fuel (the only kind on hand) at the downport might prove to be an exercise in futility, given that a) the travellers are presumably not all Aslan; b) the downport has constant shortages of the stuff; and c) they don't have the connections to cut in line. This is one of the many challenges they'll face when preparing for a trip to Htirlaosea.

If the travellers can then somehow finagle their way off the planet without being shot out of the sky for operating a human starship, they might discover that the access lane to and from Htirlaosea is monitored, but surprisingly unguarded. If they can manage to keep a low profile, the travellers can cover most of the distance unmolested by SDBs. As Yero'ilran system defense gets the idea where they're going, the travellers will be hailed and asked to either return to the system mainworld, or jump out of the system. Refusal to comply will result in compulsory vaporization by the nearest SDB.

At the time the travellers are in the system, Yero'ilra is approximately 500 million km from Htirlaosea. Under the power of a 1-G maneuver drive, the flight to the planet takes approximately 114 hours (4.75 days). If they choose to maximize the use of Htirlaosea's shadow for radiation protection, extend the travel time to 140 hours (5.8 days). Depending on the circumstances of their departure from Yero'ilra, they might choose to microjump to Htirlaosea instead (see Parleying with Ahfoisa). While it increases their travel time by a few days, it reduces their exposure to radiation, at least temporarily removes the threat of the Yero'ilran system defense fleet, and prevents Ahfoisa from knowing what they are up to if they made a deal with her.

No matter which method they choose to get there, when they arrive within 50 million km of the planet, they begin to feel the effects of Oúolaoeis' solar flares. The travellers' starship is subjected to a torrent of 700- 900 RADs. If they're flying in a civilian starship with unhardened systems, they will experience intermittent failures of their comms, sensors, and various life support systems. Keeping those systems online will be a challenge and will keep their technical personnel busy for the last portion of their journey. Every time they address one problem, a new alarm will go off and another crisis arises for them to tackle.

Anyone not wearing some kind of radiation-resistant suit will be subjected to severe levels of radiation. Refer to the Traveller Core Rulebook for information on the effects. Once they are behind the planet and within a few diameters, the rad levels drop and they can optionally remove their protective gear, which by then might be chafing quite a bit and perhaps not smelling very good either!

Because of the radiation issues, the Yetrai have only placed two very expensive shielded satellites in orbit. These are primarily used for survey purposes, but also function as sentinels. With a Difficult (10+)
Electronics (Comms or Sensors) check, the travellers will be able to determine that the satellites are also beaming a constant stream of information to Yero'ilra system defense. The computers in these satellites are of abysmally low tech, and a hacker can spoof their transmissions by a) penetrating their security, and then b) falsifying the transponder ID data. This requires a task chain:

Hack satellite security: Average (8+) Electronics (Computers) check (1D minutes, INT). followed by...

Falsify their ship's transponder data to fool system defense: Difficult (10+) Electronics (Sensors) check (1Dx10 minutes, INT).

If they succeed, they are able to land on Htirlaosea without incident. If they fail, Yero'ilran system defense has been notified and will dispatch one or more SDBs immediately. Note that these are very fast ships and the travellers will have a limited amount of time (maybe 24 hours or less) to get in and get out before they arrive.

## Perpetual Twilight

The Htirlaosea laboratory is perched 1,000km from the stellar horizon, keeping it relatively safe from Oúolaoeis' flare activity. The dark side of the planet is reasonably safe with its rocky body providing a radiation shield for the lab. The temperature varies from a frigid -170°C in the darkest regions of the planet to an almost manageable -25 to 25°C near the twilight zones.

In the light zones, under the blistering gaze of Oúolaoeis, the temperature rises to a molten 380°C. Of course, this is the least of your worries if you attempt to cross the bright side of the planet given that the star's radioactive tendrils that will fry all but the the most hardened tech.

The presence of radiation is constant. While it is reduced on the dark side, safely traversing the surface still requires a shielded vehicle or radiation-resistant vacc suit (refer to the Central Supply Catalog).

The base itself is an unassuming construction, a collection of three large, semi-dome-shaped advanced bases, each approximately two storeys tall. The bases are linked together and there are only two entrances: one large maintenance airlock in the front and a much smaller service airlock in the back.

The base is guarded by four Aslan males in hazardous environment vacc suits, all armed with gauss rifles (with undercarriage grenade launchers) and laser pistols.

Inside the facility itself, the staff consists of 25 Aslan females, three of whom are managers and the remainder research scientists and engineers. Ten of the human slaves taken from Tktk are present, all of whom are working on projects with the staff.

If the travellers manage to infiltrate the base (likely over the dead bodies of the guards), they will be surprised to discover that most of the slaves are rather enthusiastically working to solve the Yetrai's problems. If the travellers manage to barge in, armed and armored, the Aslan research team surrenders immediately. Despite being members of a slavery-based society, the female members of the research community are quite removed from the day-to-day management of slaves. Most, if not all, of them probably abhor violence and conduct their lives in pursuit of scientific discovery.

If the travellers persist in threatening the Aslan research staff, some members of the enslaved human scientific team will come to their defense and demand that the travellers stand down.

## Time to Go

Whether or not they come to the defense of their Aslan peers, most of the scientists who were taken as slaves on Tktk are happy to see their liberators; however, most (if not all) of them have also made friends among the Aslan research staff, whom they do see as mildly complicit in their plight, but not actively so.

Donning radiation-resistant vacc suits, the majority of them pack up their humble belongings and prepare to depart with the rescue team, but amazingly enough a small minority choose to stay. One or two of the enslaved scientists are genuinely consumed by the work they're doing and refuse to leave. While their prospects for eventual liberation are dubious at best, they see themselves as not only scientists but ambassadors of human civilization. They might idealistically believe that they can help change the Glorious Empire for the better by teaching them that cooperation need not be coerced. Sometimes all you have to do is ask for help and you'll get it.

## Drill Baby Drill

The Yetrai research team has used three boring vehicles to drill a tunnel several hundred kilometers westward, toward the bright side of Htirlaosea. The tunnel is being excavated about 20m below the surface of the planet to provide ample radiation protection.

The Yetrai were heretofore unable to drill through the dense, rocky body of the planet until their captive scientists helped them to construct a plasma boring device that they mounted to some of their mole vehicles.

In their wake, they have left dozens of construction robots, which are working like busy bees assembling steel struts and frameworks, with the intention of eventually making the tunnel a permanent passage to the bright side.

Three Aslan scientists (all female, of course) and 10 of the scientific research team are present at the current terminus of the tunnel, 225km from the facility.

Referee's Note: For the boring vehicles, use the Termite Excavating Vehicle from p. 91 of the Vehicle Handbook, adding a plasma drilling device to its equipment.

The humans might have concocted numerous other solutions to the Aslans' problems as well. This text leaves it up to the referee as to what additional problems needed solving and the inventions and technological solutions the captured scientists have come up with to remedy them.

Extracting the 10 scientists in the tunnel is going to be a problem. While the drilling team has installed several vertical tunnels to the surface, spaced fairly evenly along their course toward the bright side, only the hardiest of gear can survive the temperatures and radiation levels outside. The travellers are not likely to have such equipment, but if they do, the option of flying to the furthest vertical tunnel and extracting the captives the easy way is available to them and will result in the fastest extraction time.

If they must traverse the passage underground, that presents a challenge. The travellers have more than likely tipped Yero'ilran System Defense to their presence by this time, especially if they killed one or more of the guards. Even if they successfully hacked the satellites, once the guards do not check in on an hourly basis using voiceprint tech, the missile-equipped SDBs will head to Htirlaosea fast and furious.

Travelling to the scientists via the tunnel will take a great deal of time, very likely more than the 24 hours it will take for the SDBs to arrive. If they have an air/raft or similar vehicle, they might be able to pull it off. The tunnel is not that large and it will require some very good driving to make the trip without damaging the vehicle.

There is one other option for them to travel overland: the Aslan have two two-man radiation-shielded walkers. Use Drive skill and all tasks rolls are made at -2 to compensate for their alien interfaces. Once they get to one of the more distant vertical access tunnels, there is the problem of momentary heat and radiation exposure, but let's leave that to the realm of traveller creativity.

## Take a Lode Off, Annie

After infiltrating the research base and liberating the scientists, one of them mentions a lanthanum lode. During their test runs to the bright side, they managed to acquire several ore and mineral samples including a valuable 20-tonne lot of lanthanum and trace amounts of other rare-earth ores. It might help the travellers recoup some of their losses on this trip if that lode managed to “slip” into their cargo hold.

## The SDBs

If the travellers take too long to extract the scientists from the tunnel, Yero'ilran system defense ships arrive to give them a hearty send off.

The SDBs are of the mind that they should shoot first and ask questions later, but they will not target the travellers' ship if it is adjacent to the research facility. They will land and dispatch a squad of marines in powered armor to deal with the interlopers up close and personally.

# Get the Heck Outta Dodge

Once the travellers have rescued the desired number of enslaved scientists and tktks, they can depart Yero'ilra system. After what they have experienced, they will probably be happy to see its trinary star system in their rear-view mirror.

# Author's Note

The Tktk Convergence and Iron Spine were originally intended to be parts 1 and 2 of a trilogy. While a third part was never written, if you can get your Travellers to nearby Hteakya (one parsec from Yero'ilra), you can run a slightly modified version of Mongoose Publishing's Reach Adventure 6: Exodus as the third part of the story. The start of Exodus has the Travellers on Acis to start, but they are quickly whisked away to Hteakya where the adventure starts in earnest. If you skip the Acis part, you can start on Hteakya and roll right into the next chapter of the story. This will require a little transitional hocus pocus on the part of the referee, but after an escape from Yero'ilra to Hteakya, you can drop right into the action of Exodus.
