## Library Data on the Lariinaan

A [[Imperium|Third Imperium]] battle cruiser, commanded by Captain Bleddyn Mathias Wilson- Aadarkhi. Disappeared in the Phlume system in 1100. No wreckage or survivors were ever found despite numerous searches for the cruiser. Speculation amongst the space-faring community is that it was a victim of _The Phlume Triangle_.
