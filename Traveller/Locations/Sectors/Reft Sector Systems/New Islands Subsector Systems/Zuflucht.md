Zuflucht has a thin, tainted atmosphere but is otherwise habitable. As the extreme spinward-coreward point of the Islands Cluster it would not normally be important in the affairs of the region but since the arrival of the Imperium in the Islands, Zuflucht has become the arrival/departure point for trans-rift traffic. As such, it is of some importance to the Imperium. The orbital component of the starport has been expanded to serve as a naval base.

In practice, the Imperial naval base at Zuflucht is little more than offices used by liaison and intelligence personnel plus a berthing area only occupied when an Imperial warship is in port. This is not often; the Imperial Navy maintains a presence in the Islands but its ships are constantly engaged in flag-showing cruises and spend little time in orbit around Zuflucht.
