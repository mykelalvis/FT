On our small planet, at this moment, here we face a critical branch point in history. What we do with our planet, right now, will propagate down through the centuries and powerfully affect the destiny of our descendants.

It is well within our power to destroy our civilization and, perhaps, our species as well. If we capitulate to superstition, greed or stupidity, we can plunge our world into a darkness deeper than the time between the collapse of classical civilization and the Italian renaissance.

But we are also capable of using our compassion and our intelligence, our technology and our wealth, to create an abundant and meaningful life for every inhabitant of this planet. To enhance enormously our understanding of the universe, and to carry us to the stars...

# INTRODUCTION

Traveller is a science fiction roleplaying game of the far future. A multitude of universes await players and you will find Traveller is capable of handling almost any kind of science fiction setting, from highly intricate cyberpunk worlds to campaigns spanning entire galaxies where mighty empires clash and suns explode.

If you have a favorite science fiction film or TV show, Traveller will be able to replicate it for you, bringing your best-loved futuristic moments to your tabletop.

CHARTED SPACE While Traveller is intended to be used for any science fiction setting its players devise, the longest running commercially available universe (indeed, one of the oldest roleplaying game settings of all) is Charted Space.

Humanity has gone to the stars and found them crowded with other forms of life and other sentient species, and science and technology have advanced vastly over the present day – but the essential nature of humanity is unchanged. Life continues as it does now, only spread out over the sea of stars. A mighty Imperium unites thousands of worlds under a single rule but it is beset by enemies both internal and external.

The Imperium commands the space between the stars, ensuring that civilization endures and trade continues. Megacorporations and feudal lords conduct the bulk of this trade but there will always be a place for the free trader – hardy Travellers and adventurers on the fringes of Charted Space, dealing in strange goods and smuggled cargoes, doing whatever they can to make a Credit.

While Traveller can be used to model almost any science fiction novel, movie or setting, the traditional setting for adventures is the Third Imperium of Humaniti, the third great empire to stretch across the stars. In the Charted Space universe, players take on the roles of tramp traders and mercenaries, wandering the galaxy in search of profit and adventure.

Players and Travellers Most participants in a Traveller game will be players. Usually, each player generates a character using the Traveller Creation rules; that character becomes the player's avatar in the game world and is called a Traveller. These Travellers are the central protagonists of the game and scenarios revolve around their adventures and actions.

Throughout this rulebook, the terms player and Traveller are synonymous. The term character is used to describe those in the game controlled by the referee rather than the players – what are often called non-player characters. However, rules that apply to Travellers are usually applicable to characters and vice versa.

THE REFEREE One of the participants is the referee, who describes the world around the Travellers, presents them with challenges and dangers, and takes on the role of the supporting cast and antagonists. The referee creates the basic outline of the adventures that the Travellers encounter and resolves the results of their actions using the rules in this book as a guideline.

TRAVELLER RULE ZERO Many roleplaying games have a 'rule zero', which marks out a referee's fiat, the notion that the referee is free to ignore or change any rule to fit in with their campaign. This is true of Traveller as well but it is worth making a special note about this game.

Traveller comprises several 'mini-games' such as world creation, trade and character creation that allows much of the game to run on 'autopilot'. In many circumstances, the referee is able to make a few rolls on a few tables and generate characters, battles, even a sizeable part of the known universe – this is great news for the busy referee who can then concentrate on the adventure. However, while these tools are in place, the referee should never feel bound by them and has the latitude to ignore any generated results in preference to their own creations.

Traveller Rule Zero is this: The rules in this book, indeed in every Traveller book, provide merely a framework. If any rules conflict with a referee's vision for their universe, even if that universe is the official Charted Space setting, then they must give way and be altered to fit.

ADVENTURES AND CAMPAIGNS In an adventure, the Travellers embark on a journey or scenario overseen by the referee. The referee determines what dangers the Travellers will face, from hostile aliens and criminals to solar flares and automated defence systems or even political intrigue and deception. The Travellers decide how they will react and overcome these obstacles. For example, the Travellers may be hired to bring a cargo from one world to another but a rival merchant is trying to stop them and has hired a band of mercenaries to attack the Travellers' ship en route. The Travellers have to get the cargo through safely.

An adventure can be a one-off game, using Travellers created by the referee specifically for that game and discarded afterwards or it can be part of a campaign. An adventure takes one or more game sessions to complete.

A campaign is a series of adventures, charting the continuing escapades of a group of Travellers, and is the most common form of Traveller – mainly because it is the most fun and rewarding! A campaign can be continuous or episodic. In a continuous campaign, each adventure follows on almost immediately from the end of the last and the fuel, resources and money available to the Travellers is carefully tracked. In an episodic campaign, there are longer gaps between adventures and the game focuses only on the exciting and conflict- filled parts of the Travellers' lives.

CAMPAIGN IDEAS These are a few common types of campaign that are often used in Traveller.

The Trader Campaign: The Travellers form the crew of a free trader merchant vessel, taking whatever cargoes they can get to keep their spacecraft flying and in one piece. Inspiration for games like this could come from the TV series Firefly or video games such as Elite and Privateer.

The Military Campaign: The Travellers are all members of a military unit, usually veterans of similar careers, participating in wars, skirmishes and other military activities. Inspiration could come from the Honor Harrington novels, the film Aliens or Starship Troopers – the book, animated series or film.

The Explorer Campaign: In a campaign of this type the Travellers go beyond the borders of Charted Space, looking for objects, planets and civilizations of value or curiosity. The Travellers will have to be highly self-sufficient to survive on their own for long stretches. For inspiration look no further than the original series of Star Trek.

The Traveller Campaign: The traditional Traveller campaign features a little of everything. The Travellers will go from exploring abandoned alien ziggurats to rescuing missing pets to taking on the local crime lord in a protracted gang war. Inspiration could come from anywhere.

Specialised types of campaign are detailed in two expansions – Mercenary and Element Class Cruisers. Mercenary shows Travellers how to recruit, run and fight with a dedicated military unit, allowing them to make their fortune with a platoon or company of soldiers. Meanwhile, Element Class Cruisers includes the Naval Campaign Sourcebook, which provides everything needed to run a
'bridge crew' style of campaign, where the Travellers will be the senior officers of a mighty capital ship!

FURTHER READING Throughout this book, mention is made of other titles available in the Traveller series. Each of these books concentrates on a particular aspect of Traveller, allowing you to expand your game into new realms of play. However, none are vital or necessary to the game and are presented only for your continued enjoyment

- you can explore a huge portion of the galaxy with the Traveller Core Rulebook alone!

Traveller Companion: Space is big and there was only so much we could squeeze into the pages of the Traveller Core Rulebook. The Traveller Companion is a book dedicated to alternative methods of play, differing technologies and the experimentation of expanded genres. From environmental hazards on alien worlds to alternate career creation, the Traveller Companion is a massive toolkit allowing you to tailor your campaign exactly how you want it.

High Guard: For campaigns that include a great amount of space travel, High Guard is invaluable. Including a complete spacecraft design system, this book allows Travellers and referees to create their own ships from scratch or customise those already designed. As well as featuring a veritable fleet of new ships, High Guard also introduces a brand new scale of combat – [[Capital]] scale, where giant dreadnoughts and battleships clash across entire star systems.

The Third Imperium: The Third Imperium is the greatest interstellar empire in the history of Charted Space. This book contains everything Travellers and referees need to explore the Third Imperium, including descriptions of its people, society, military forces and power brokers, and a complete exploration of the [[Core sector]]  - the heart of the entire empire.

Behind the Claw: Covering two complete sectors on the frontier of the Third Imperium (the Spinward Marches and Deneb), this book lays out a classic area of the Charted Space universe. Here you will find worlds, megacorporations, alien species and powerful factions all ready to be explored in your adventures and forming a backdrop to entire campaigns.

Central Supply Catalogue: This book contains all manner of unique items that no self-respecting Traveller should be without. Whether you are looking for a more powerful weapon, sophisticated bugging equipment or the finest in home comforts, this book has it all. Neatly divided into easy to find sections, the Central Supply Catalogue greatly expands the range of equipment and tools available to Travellers.

Vehicle Handbook: This book contains a complete construction system allowing you to build any vehicle from any universe, from a simple bicycle to advanced power armor, from a floating aircraft carrier to a massive piloted robot. Full rules are also given to completely customise your vehicles and a huge number of ready built designs are included to expand your campaigns.

Robot Handbook: Advanced civilizations build automated servants to perform the most arduous, mundane or dangerous tasks. The Robot Handbook provides a complete construction system for mechanical servants, from simple domestic droids to huge and powerful war robots that can dominate battlefields. Also included are many robots, ready to populate your universes.

Pirates of Drinax: If you are looking for an exciting and in-depth campaign that is ready for Travellers to dive into, look no further than the Pirates of Drinax. A massive sandbox covering the Trojan Reach sector, the Travellers will be given a letter of marque and a mission to bring an old empire back to eminence through piracy!

GAME CONVENTIONS A quick discussion of terminology and conventions is needed before proceeding. Traveller uses two six-sided dice to resolve most actions. Some situations involve fewer or more dice.

1D/2D: To avoid writing 'roll two six-sided dice and add them together' over and over again, Traveller uses the abbreviation 'roll 2D'. Where you see 'roll 2D' read 'roll two six-sided dice and add them together'. Sometimes you may also see '1D', '3D' or other numbers of 'D'. This simply means roll one six-sided dice, three six-sided dice, or however many six-sided dice are indicated, and add them together to gain the final result.

2D+3/3D-2: If an addition or subtraction appears after the normal dice abbreviation, that simply means add or subtract the number shown to the total rolled. So, for example, 2D+3 means 'roll two dice, add them together and then add three'.

D3: Occasionally, you may see a reference to D3. This means we treat the dice as if they have only three sides each, by dividing the number rolled by two and rounding upwards. So, a roll of 1–2 means one, a roll of 3–4 means two and a roll of 5–6 means three. If a number appears before the 'D' (such as 2D3, for example), this means roll two dice and divide the results of both by two before adding them together.

D66: This is shorthand for a special way of rolling two six-sided dice. Before rolling nominate one dice as the 'tens' die and one as the 'units' die, to give you a two-digit number between 11 and 66. Some numbers cannot be rolled on a D66 (any number with a 7 or higher in it), giving you a total of 36 possible outcomes.

Rolls: To determine if a Traveller succeeds or fails at a particular task, you must make a roll. A roll is always done by rolling 2D and adding any appropriate Dice Modifiers. If the total is equal to or greater than the target number for that roll, they succeed. The target number for a roll will always be listed in its description. For example, you may be asked to roll for STR 10+. This would mean roll two dice, add your Strength modifier and get 10 or more to succeed.

Checks: A check is exactly the same as a roll but the Dice Modifier will always be a characteristic or skill. Thus, you will be asked for a characteristic check or skill check. For most characteristic or skill checks, you will need to get an 8 or more after all Dice Modifiers have been applied in order to succeed.

Natural 2/Natural 12: Some rolls refer to a 'natural' number – this is the actual number rolled on the dice before any modifiers are applied.

Dice Modifier (DM) : A number to be applied to a dice roll before it is used. Dice Modifiers are always followed by a sign, which indicates if the number is to be added to or subtracted from the roll. For example, DM-2 indicates that two is to be subtracted from the roll; DM+4 indicates that four is to be added to the roll.

Rounding: Unless otherwise stated, whenever you are asked to divide in Traveller, always round down.

TECH LEVELS The concept of Tech Levels (or TL) runs through Traveller in most of its universes. Tech Levels measure the scientific capacity of a world and the complexity and effectiveness of a piece of equipment. The Tech Level scale starts at 0. In the Charted Space universe, the most advanced scientists are probing the upper boundaries of TL15 but most core worlds range between TL10 and TL13. Out on the fringes of the Imperium in sectors like the Spinward Marches or Trojan Reach, Tech Levels vary wildly. Isolated systems visited only once or twice a generation might have slipped back into the darkness, losing technology to war or disaster. On other worlds, secret research bases, isolationist colonies or relics of the Ancients hold scientific secrets of vast worth.

Even on a less advanced world, there might be examples of higher technology. A warlord on a primitive planet might enforce their rule with advanced weapons imported from offworld; colony worlds are often dependent on their sponsor civilization for supplies and support. Some low-technology worlds are aware of the larger universe and have consciously decided to reject advanced technology.

TL0 (Primitive) No technology. TL0 worlds have only discovered the simplest tools and principles and are on par with Earth's Stone Age.

TL1 (Primitive) Roughly on a par with Bronze or Iron age technology. TL1 science is mostly superstition but manufacture weapons and work metals.

TL2 (Primitive) Renaissance technology. TL2 brings with it a greater understanding of chemistry, physics, biology and astronomy as well as the scientific method.

TL3 (Primitive) The advances of TL2 are now applied, bringing the germ of industrial revolution and steam power. Primitive firearms now dominate the battlefield. This is roughly comparable to the early 19th Century.

TL4 (Industrial) The transition to industrial revolution is complete, bringing plastics, radio and other such inventions. Roughly comparable to the late 19th/early 20th Century.

TL5 (Industrial) TL5 brings widespread electrification, telecommunications and internal combustion. At the high end of the TL, atomics and primitive computing appear. Roughly on a par with the mid-20th Century.

TL6 (Industrial) TL6 brings the development of fission power and more advanced computing. Advances in materials technology and rocketry bring about the dawn of the space age.

TL7 (Pre-Stellar) A pre-stellar society can reach orbit reliably and has telecommunications satellites. Computers and integrated circuits become ubiquitous. At the time of writing, Earth is currently somewhere between TL and TL8.

TL8 (Pre-Stellar) At TL8, it is possible to reach other worlds in the same star system, although terraforming or full colonization are not within the culture's capacity. Permanent space habitats become possible. Fusion power becomes commercially viable.

TL9 (Pre-Stellar) The defining element of TL9 is the development of gravity manipulation, which makes space travel vastly safer and faster. This research leads to development of the jump drive, which occurs near the end of this Tech Level. TL9 cultures can colonize other worlds, although travelling to a colony is often a one-way trip.

TL10 (Early Stellar) With the advent of commonly available jump drives, nearby systems are opened up. Orbital habitats and factories become common. Interstellar travel and trade lead to an economic boom. Colonies become much more viable.

TL11 (Early Stellar) The first true artificial intelligences become possible, as computers are able to model synaptic networks. Grav- supported structures reach to the heavens. Jump- travel becomes possible, allowing easier travel beyond the one jump stellar mains.

TL12 (Average Stellar) Planetwide weather control revolutionises terraforming and agriculture. Portable plasma weapons and carrier- mounted fusion guns make the battlefield untenable for unarmored combatants. Jump-3 travel is developed.

TL13 (Average Stellar) Battle dress appears on the battlefield in response to new weapons, heralding the pinnacle of personal armor and making infantry the equivalent of less advanced armored vehicles. Cloning of body parts becomes easy. Jump-4 travel appears.

TL14 (Average Stellar) Fusion weapons become portable. Flying cities appear. Jump-5 drives are built.

TL15 (High Stellar) Black globe generators suggest a new direction for defensive technologies, while the development of synthetic anagathics means that human lifespan is now vastly increased.

Higher Tech Levels exist (indeed, there is no theoretical upper limit) and may appear in other universes or be discovered by pioneering scientists within Charted Space.

# TRAVELLER CREATION

Instead of choosing a class and various skills or abilities, in Traveller you start off as a bright-eyed 18 year old with the whole universe at your feet. You will then decide what kind of career you might want to pursue and then watch as your Traveller's life unfolds – very possibly in a completely different direction!

When you have finished this process, you will be ready for play with a Traveller who has history and a full career (successful or otherwise) behind them. They will now be ready for the next phase of their life, one full of excitement and adventure...

It should be noted that there are no 'super' characters in Traveller. This game is very much based around the idea of putting ordinary people in extraordinary situations and of playing with the cards that the universe has dealt you. Be ready to make the best of what you get – much like real life (although real life tends to lack starships, exploding suns and eight foot tall intelligent lion-like aliens).

So, another Traveller may end up as a battle-hardened marine who can shoot out a fox's eye at 100 paces with any weapon in Charted Space but your failed rock star who never managed to get anywhere in their career may well have more to contribute to the group. After all, not every problem can be solved with a gun. In fact, in Traveller, a gun may cause more issues than it solves.

CREATION SUMMARY A Traveller's abilities and skills are determined by training and past experience. Traveller creation begins with rolling characteristics, six values that describe your initial physical and mental capabilities. After determining characteristics and a few background skills from adolescent life, it is time to embark on a career. Each Traveller goes through one or more four-year career terms, which grant various skills and benefits. There are risks associated with each career – serving a tour of duty in the Imperial Marines may give a Traveller a good grounding in combat and weapons use but there is always the risk of injury in battle. A term spent in a corporation is unlikely to get a Traveller injured or killed but will not usually provide skills valuable in combat.

In addition to skills, Travellers pick up benefits such as cash, equipment or contacts from a career. However, there are limits on how many career terms a Traveller can go through – the risks of aging or injury mount up over time and some Travellers will move between two or three careers in their lives. At some point, you will decide to leave your career for a new life of adventure before your Traveller gets too old.

While going through a career, you can establish ties between your Traveller and those of the other players, so everyone will be old friends (or rivals!) before play begins. You will also be able to pick a skills package after everyone has finished creating their Travellers, which will allow you to fill any gaps in the group's skill range.

For alternate forms of Traveller creation such as point allocation systems, consult the Traveller Companion.

GROUP CREATION It is common in roleplaying games for players to create their characters before play begins, so everyone turns up on the first day of a campaign ready to go. It is rare for us to say this but, in Traveller, this is the Wrong Thing to do.

Traveller creation is intended as a group activity, partly because of the Connections Rule (see page 19) but also because it was specifically designed to be done as a group activity, with players able to see how one another's Travellers are progressing and get a deeper understanding of what they were doing before the campaign begins.

So, treat Traveller creation as a kind of 'mini' game that takes place in the first session of every new campaign. Your enjoyment of Traveller will increase greatly, we promise you!

CHARACTERISTICS Every person in Traveller, human and alien, has several characteristics that describe their base mental and physical potential. The basic characteristics for humans are shown here.

**ROLLING CHARACTERISTICS** To determine your Traveller's characteristics, roll 2D one after another and assign the scores in any order you wish to the six characteristics, starting with STR. Record them on your character sheet.

Alternatively, you may wish instead to assign each score to the characteristics in order, starting with STR, then DEX, then END and so on. After all, we do not get to decide how strong or smart we are before we are born!

For each characteristic, determine its Dice Modifier
(DM) on the Characteristic Modifiers table.

Characteristic Modifiers

Characteristic Score Dice Modifier

0 -

1–2 -

3–5 -

6–8 +

9–11 +

12–14 +

15+ +

As you progress through your career, you may find your characteristics change.

The maximum score for a characteristic is 15 for an unaugmented Traveller. There are exceptions to this but they will be covered later for specific rules and circumstances.

PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS Strength (STR): A Traveller's physical strength, fitness and forcefulness. Dexterity (DEX): Physical co-ordination and agility, reflexes. Endurance (END): A Traveller's stamina, determination and ability to sustain damage.

MENTAL CHARACTERISTICS Intellect (INT): A Traveller's intelligence and quickness of mind. Education (EDU): A measure of a Traveller's learning and experience. Social Standing (SOC): A Traveller's place in society.

SKILLS Skills are the most important aspect of a Traveller and discussed in detail on page 58. A Traveller's proficiency in any skill is denoted by their level in that skill.

BACKGROUND SKILLS Before embarking on your careers, you receive a number of background skills equal to your EDU DM
+3 (so, 0 to 6, depending on your EDU score), chosen from the list here. This represents the knowledge you have picked up during adolescence and will allow you to function at a basic level in a technological society.

Admin 0 Electronics 0 Science 0 Animals 0 Flyer 0 Seafarer 0 Art 0 Language 0 Streetwise 0 Athletics 0 Mechanic 0 Survival 0 Carouse 0 Medic 0 Vacc Suit 0 Drive 0 Profession 0

At this point, you are 18 years old and ready to take on the universe!

**WHERE DO I COME FROM?** While knowledge of a Traveller's homeworld is not necessary, it is a very nice tool to start shaping the character from the outset. Background skills can be picked to help suggest the kind of world the Traveller grew up on. For example, a Traveller coming from a naturalistic, agricultural world may well have Animals, Seafarer and Survival skills, whereas one whose childhood was spent in an asteroid belt would likely have Vacc Suit, Electronics and Flyer, representing a life in space surrounded by high technology.

This is by no means compulsory but you may find the Traveller you create starts to come alive much faster.

CAREERS Next, your Traveller engages in one or more career terms, representing their experiences and adventures before the start of the campaign. Each career term lasts for four years, even if a Traveller fails a Survival roll or is forced to leave a career.

At many points during a career, a Traveller will have to make a dice roll of some sort. Many of these rolls are based on characteristics – simply roll 2D, add the DM from the listed characteristic and try to get a total higher than or equal to the listed value.

So, a roll of INT 8+ means 'roll 2D, add your Intellect DM and you succeed if you roll an 8 or more'.

SOCIAL STANDING AND NOBILITY Travellers with a high SOC are the cream of their civilizations and may be very well known on their world and possibly across vast swathes of Charted Space. However, while the Third Imperium maintains a system of nobility recognised across most of its worlds, not everyone with a high SOC necessarily has a noble title – or is even a noble at all. Nobles of very high rank have many duties and obligations that may preclude them from a life of adventure. After all, a typical duke will reign over many worlds and Travellers will generally want to explore the universe rather than be engaged in constant administration.

A few rolls are skill checks, where you add any levels in that skill. For example, a roll of Gun Combat 8+ would mean 'roll 2D, add your Gun Combat skill level and get 8 or more to succeed'.

Note that later in the rules, you are able to add further modifiers to checks like this (for example, when using the Gun Combat skill to shoot, you can often add your DEX DM). However, these other modifiers are never applied during Traveller creation.

In each career, there are three assignments, representing different aspects of the career. Pick one of these assignments when you enter the career.

If the group includes a Traveller with a high SOC, we recommend one of the following courses:

•  Sons, daughters and more distant relations to a named noble may carry a great deal of social weight without actually having a title themselves (although they may well inherit later, depending on how far down the line of succession they are).
•  The Traveller may well be a high-ranking noble – but has been deposed or otherwise ousted from their position. Perhaps they will someday regain their seat or maybe they will spend the rest of their life trying to escape those who removed them.
•  SOC need not be tied to nobility – celebrities will also command a high score in this characteristic. A Traveller's career might point the way to why a SOC is so high, perhaps as a war hero or famous writer. However, it is also possible that the Traveller is simply known for being known, much like some celebrities in our own world.

If a title is desired, the Noble Titles table provides a suitable link between specific noble titles and SOC.

Noble Titles Social Standing Possible Titles 11 Knight 12 Baron 13 Marquis 14 Count 15 Duke

Name: We recommend naming your Traveller before anything else. Trust us on this! Species: Are you an alien? See page 52.

Armor: This provides protection against attacks and, sometimes, radiation. See page 100 for more details.

Characteristics: Roll 2D for each and then consult page 9 to determine their Dice Modifiers (DM).

Study Period: During down time and long voyages, you will have the chance to study new skills.

Finances: You may earn a lot of money during your Career, but it can disappear quickly!

Skills: This section shows what you can do, Skills and Tasks are covered on page 58.

Equipment: Anything that you carry that is not armor or a weapon is noted here. A full list of equipment can be found on page 97.

Augments: These are biological and cybernetic implants that improve your Traveller. Augments are covered on page 106.

Weapons: Weapons can be gained during Traveller creation or purchased while adventuring. See page 124 for their characteristics.

**People You Know:** During your career, you may meet many Allies, Contacts, Enemies and Rivals. Remember them, as they may appear in a later adventure.

Previous History: A personal history of the Traveller to date including careers, awards and decorations.

Background Notes: Here you can detail any additional information about your Traveller that may be relevant. Experiences that changed their outlook on life, personality quirks or psycological traits are just a few examples.

Personal Data File: All of your Traveller's vital statistics at a glance a second time for efficiency. With a spot for a selfie!

Wounds: Any long-term wounds your Traveller may be suffering from, including any medication they need, can be listed here.

Your character sheet can be folded into a neat little booklet!

PRE-CAREER EDUCATION Before a Traveller embarks on a lifelong career, there are educational options that may be worth considering. These are going to university or attending a military academy.

This usually takes place in a Traveller's first term (in place of a career), although it can be delayed up until the third term if a term or two in a career is desired. From term four onwards, pre-career education is no longer available.

A Traveller can select university or military academy, making a roll for successful entry. If this is failed, the Traveller must immediately attempt entry into a career and, failing that, be drafted as normal. Further attempts can be made in terms two and three if desired but only one attempt can be made for entry to one of these pre- career options in any one term.

Once successful entry has been achieved, the Traveller will gain any skills noted and roll on the Pre-career Events table. Upon successful graduation, one or more benefits will be awarded. Unlike a career, there is no mustering out or gaining of anything else other than the benefits listed. If graduation is not achieved, then no benefits are gained although the Traveller will still have earned some skills during this time.

After successful graduation, a Traveller may attempt to enter a career of their choice as normal, although they may have earned bonuses or automatic entry to certain careers, as listed under graduation benefits.

UNIVERSITY Many worlds have one or more universities within their major settlements but even citizens of the most remote system can engage in university education through the use of computer networks and interstellar communications. A university education will channel a Traveller's efforts into a narrow range of skills but there are few other ways to become more skilful within them so quickly.

Entry: EDU 6+ DM-1 if in Term Two, DM-2 if in Term Three DM+1 if SOC 9 or higher

Skills: Choose a level 0 and a level 1 skill from the following list:

Admin, Advocate, Animals (training or veterinary), Art
(any), Astrogation, Electronics (any), Engineer (any), Language (any), Medic, Navigation, Profession (any), Science (any).

Increase EDU by +

Graduation: INT 6+. If 10+ is rolled, graduate with honors.

Graduation Benefits
•  Increase both of the skills chosen before by one level.
•  Increase EDU by an additional +1.
•  Graduation grants DM+1 (DM+2 if graduation was with honors) to qualify for the following careers; Agent, Army, Citizen (corporate), Entertainer
(journalist), Marines, Navy, Scholar, Scouts.
•  Graduation allows a commission roll to be taken before the first term of a military career, so long as it is the first career chosen after university. Success will mean the Traveller enters the career at officer rank 1. If graduation was with honors, DM+2 is granted on this first commission roll.

MILITARY ACADEMY For those looking to dedicate their lives to military service, there is no better option than joining an academy to round out an education. This is a popular choice for those coming from 'military' families or those having grown up never considering anything other than a life in uniform. A term within a military academy can set a recruit's career for great things, so competition to gain one of the limited number of open student slots is fierce.

Before joining a military academy, you must decide whether it is an academy of the Army, Marines or Navy.

Entry: Army END 7+, Marines END 8+, Navy INT 8+ DM-2 if in Term Two, DM-4 if in Term Three.

Skills: Gain all Service Skills of the military career the academy is tied to at level 0, as with basic training.

Graduation: INT 7+. If 11+ is rolled, graduate with honors. DM+1 if END 8 or higher, DM+1 if SOC 8 or higher.

Graduation Benefits
•  If entering the same military career the academy is tied to, select any three Service Skills and increase them to level 1.
•  Increase EDU by +1.
•  If the Traveller graduated with honors, increase SOC by +1 as well.
•  Graduation allows automatic entry into the military career the academy is tied to, so long as it is the first career attempted by the Traveller after graduation.

•  Graduation allows a commission roll to be taken before the first term of a military career, so long as it is the first career chosen after university, with DM+2. Success will mean the Traveller enters the career at officer rank 1. If graduation was with honors, the Traveller will automatically pass this roll.

If a Traveller attends a military academy but fails to graduate, they may still automatically enter the military career that the academy is tied to, so long as they did not roll 2 or less on the graduation roll. If they choose to enter this career, they may not make a commission roll in the first term.

**EVENTS DURING PRE-CAREER EDUCATION** For any term a Traveller spends in pre-career education, roll on the Pre-career Events table. As with career events, other Travellers may be linked to with the connections rule – perhaps they even spent time in the same university or academy!

If drafted through an event, enter the new career next term but do not graduate. This (and similar effects) can cause a Traveller to be drafted more than once.

**Pre-Career Events**

|2D| Event|
| 2 | You are approached by an underground (and highly illegal) psionic group who sense potential in you. You may test your PSI and attempt to enter the Psion career in any subsequent term, (see page 236). |
| 3 | Your time in education is not a happy one and you suffer a deep tragedy; perhaps you become hopelessly addicted to drink or drugs, a failed romance leaves you in tatters or a fatal accident involving a close friend shakes your confidence. You crash and fail to graduate. |
| 4 | A supposedly harmless prank goes wrong and someone gets hurt, physically or emotionally. Roll SOC 8+. If you succeed, gain a Rival. If you fail, gain an Enemy. If you roll 2, you fail to graduate and must take the Prisoner career in your next term. |
| 5 | Taking advantage of youth, you party as much as you study. Gain Carouse 1. |
| 6 | You become involved in a tightly knit clique or group and make a pact to remain friends forever, wherever in the galaxy you may end. Gain D3 Allies. |
| 7 | Life Event. Roll on the Life Events table (see page 46). |
| 8 | You join a political movement. Roll SOC 8+. If successful, you become a leading figure. Gain one Ally within the movement but gain one Enemy in wider society. |
| 9 | You develop a healthy interest in a hobby or other area of study. Gain any skill of your choice, with the exception of Jack-of-all-Trades, at level 0. |
| 10 | A newly arrived tutor rubs you up the wrong way and you work hard to overturn their conclusions. Roll 9+ on any skill you have learned during this term. If successful, you provide a truly elegant proof that soon becomes accepted as the standard approach. Gain a level in the skill you rolled on and the tutor as a Rival. |
| 11 | War comes and a wide-ranging draft is instigated. You can either flee and join the Drifter career next term or be drafted (roll 1D: 1–3 Army, 4–5 Marine, 6 Navy). Either way, you do not graduate this term. However, if you roll SOC 9+, you can get enough strings pulled to avoid the draft and complete your education – you may attempt graduation normally and are not drafted. |
| 12 | You gain wide-ranging recognition of your initiative and innovative approach to study. Increase your SOC by +1. |

CAREER DESCRIPTIONS Each career in this chapter has the following sections.

QUALIFICATION This is what you need to roll to enter that career.

If you fail this check, you cannot enter your chosen career this term. You must either submit to the draft or take the Drifter career for this term. If you leave a career, you cannot return to it in the next term.

The draft and the Drifter career are exceptions to this rule – you can be drafted into a career you were previously in but got ejected from and the Drifter career is always open. Also see Changing Assignments on page 20 for another exception.

SKILLS AND TRAINING Each career has four or five types of skill table associated with it – Personal Development, Service Skills, Assignment Skills (divided into three sub-tables corresponding to assignments), Officer and Advanced Education. In each term you spend in a career, pick one of these tables and roll 1D to see which skill you increase.

You may only roll on the Advanced Education or Commissioned tables if you have the listed requirement
(usually EDU 8 or higher, or a certain rank).

Skills can be listed with or without an associated level. If no specific level is listed, then you gain that skill at level 1 if you do not have it already, or increase its level by +1 if you are already trained in that field. If a level is listed, then you gain the skill at that level so long as it is higher than your current level in the skill.

For example, Gambler 0 would mean you receive the Gambler skill at level 0. This is of benefit to you only if you have no Gambler skill.

Vacc Suit would mean you increase your Vacc Suit skill by +1 or gain it at level 1 if you have no Vacc Suit skill to begin with. If you have Vacc Suit 0, it increases to 1, if you have Vacc Suit 2 it rises to 3 and so forth.

Streetwise 1 would mean you get the Streetwise skill at level 1. If your Streetwise skill is already 1 or more, then this is of no benefit to you. If you have no Streetwise skill, or it is only at 0, you jump straight to Streetwise 1.

SKILL LIMITS A skill may never be increased beyond level 4 during Traveller creation. Once a skill has reached level 4, any additional increases are lost. In addition, a Traveller may never have a total number of skill levels higher than three times their combined INT and EDU.

BASIC TRAINING For your first career only, instead of rolling for a skill, you get all the skills listed on the Service Skills table at level 0 as your basic training. For subsequent careers, you may pick any one skill listed in the Service Skills table at level 0 as your basic training.

Citizens and Drifters are an exception to this. They both use their appropriate Assignment Skills for basic training.

SURVIVAL Each career has a survival roll. If you fail this roll, you must immediately roll on the Mishap table for the career. This mishap will force you to leave the career immediately unless otherwise stated. You will also lose the Benefit roll for the current term. A natural 2 on the survival roll is always a failure.

EVENTS If you are still in your career after resolving the survival roll, roll on the career's Events table to see what interesting things befall you this term.

ADVANCEMENT Each career has an advancement roll to represent your successful (or otherwise) path through the career. You start each career at rank 0.

If you make a successful advancement roll, move to the next higher rank and gain an extra roll on any of the skill tables available for your career. You also get any bonuses listed for your new rank. You may only attempt to advance once per term.

If your advancement roll is equal to or less than the number of terms you have spent in this career, then you cannot continue in this career after this term. Either your services are no longer required, or events have caused you to leave, or perhaps you are simply bored and want a new challenge.

If you roll a natural 12, then you must continue in this career. You are too valuable to lose and will be strong- armed into staying.

COMMISSION This only applies to the military careers of Army, Navy and Marines. A Traveller who succeeds at a commission roll becomes a rank 1 officer in that career and progresses on the officer's rank table from then on. Trying for a commission is optional.

You may only attempt to gain a commission in your first term unless your SOC is 9 or higher, in which case you may try for a commission in any term. However, there is DM-1 applied to commission rolls for every term after the first.

Some events give a bonus DM to advancement rolls or grant automatic advancement. You can apply these DMs to commission rolls also.

If you gain a commission, you may not roll for advancement in the same term. Travellers can still roll for advancement if they fail a commission roll.

RANKS AND BONUSES You begin at rank 0 in a new career. Each time you succeed with an advancement roll, you move up to the next rank. Ranks are most important for military careers, such as the Army or Navy, but every career has its own internal hierarchies and levels of authority and responsibility. However, not all ranks have a title like the military.

Some ranks have bonuses associated with them, such as extra skills. These are acquired immediately upon attaining the rank.

BENEFITS When you leave a career for any reason, you gain material benefits from that career, representing money, equipment and influence acquired during your years of work.

Benefits are described fully on page 46.

DRIFTERS AND THE DRAFT You may attempt to enlist in one career each term if you are not continuing with an existing career. If you fail to qualify for a new career, you have two options. You can either apply to the draft, and be randomly sent to one of the military services, or you may spend that term travelling as a Drifter, without true career or purpose. A Traveller may only enter the draft once in their lifetime unless otherwise stated.

THE CONNECTIONS RULE During Traveller creation, the aim is to not only to create interesting histories for Travellers through career decisions, events and mishaps but also to ensure Travellers know one another before the campaign begins. This avoids every campaign starting with the words 'right, you all meet in the starport bar...'. In Traveller, you will all know one another to some degree and can get stuck into adventuring straight away.

If two Travellers agree, then any event rolled for one Traveller can involve another. Only one Traveller needs to have rolled the specific event, though you will find it more exciting if Travellers can link events together (this is why it is best to create Travellers as a group activity, going through terms one-by-one together).

If an event can be linked between two Travellers in this way, then they both get one extra skill of their choice. You may gain a maximum of two free skills from the connections rule and each connection must be with a different Traveller. For each connection you make, you may gain any skill but cannot bring a skill above level 3 using this rule nor may you take the Jack-of-all- Trades skill.

For example, Erik is working as an Agent and he rolls an undercover mission (event number 8 on the Agent Events table). Erik's player suggests that Erik could have met Kathya while on this mission and Kathya's player agrees. They then discuss exactly what happened during the mission and this begins to form previous history for both Travellers. Both Erik and Kathya will then gain an extra skill because of this.

Draft Table 1D Career (assignment)
| 1 | Navy (any) |
| 2 | Army (any) |
| 3 | Marine (any) |
| 4 | Merchant (merchant marine) |
| 5 | Scout (any) |
| 6 | Agent (law enforcement) |

CHANGING CAREERS A Traveller may get forced out of a career due to a mishap or event, or may simply leave voluntarily to pursue a more exciting or more lucrative life elsewhere.

To enter a new career, a Traveller need only make the appropriate qualification roll at the start of a new term. If they fail, they must either submit to the draft (if they have not already done so earlier in life) or become a Drifter.

CHANGING ASSIGNMENTS Instead of a whole new career, a Traveller may instead be interested in focussing on another aspect of their existing career by changing their assignment.

For assignments in the Army, Marine, Navy, Nobility, Rogue, Scholar or Scout career, this simply requires a qualification roll. If this is unsuccessful, the Traveller continues in the career with the same assignment they had before without penalty. If the qualification roll is made, the Traveller now adopts the new assignment and continues in the career, retaining their rank.

New assignments in the Agent, Citizen, Entertainer and Merchant careers are considered to be new careers. Upon voluntarily leaving the career (a change in assignment cannot be done if you have been ejected from the career – no one will hire you!), Benefit rolls are made as normal and a qualification roll is necessary to enter the assignment. If this is failed, the Traveller must enter the draft or become a Drifter.

If the attempt to change assignment is successful, the career begins afresh with the new assignment, with the Traveller starting at rank 0.

CONTACTS, ALLIES, RIVALS AND ENEMIES Over the course of their careers, Travellers will have made friends and foes, and established ties with various people who may play a part in future adventures. There are four categories of such associates.

Contacts: These are individuals the Traveller knows and has had friendly dealings with in the past. They have useful skills or positions and may be willing to aid the Traveller.

Allies: These are like Contacts but are willing to help the Traveller and actively go out of their way to provide aid.

Rivals: These are people who hate or oppose the Traveller and will attempt to interfere or harass them.

Enemies: These are even worse than Rivals – a Rival will normally work within the law but an Enemy wants the Traveller dead, imprisoned or otherwise doomed.

When you gain an associate from a random event, note it on your character sheet. You can give as much detail as you wish, from the sketchy ('Rival in Navy') to the detailed ('Captain Harrick, the Pride of Sylea, is my Rival, because I disobeyed his orders while on a mission. He had me drummed out of the Navy, damn him! I'll yet have my revenge!'.)

Other Travellers can be Contacts, Allies or even Rivals and doing this qualifies for taking advantage of the connections rule.

LIFE EVENTS Even in the distant future, humans are still people
(in fact, some non-humans are also people...). They work, they quarrel, they get sick, they fall in love, they complain about their in-laws... in short, life goes on. If you roll up a Life Event during your career, roll on the Life Events table.

BENEFITS In the course of a Traveller's career, they may manage to save some money. They may also acquire equipment and other benefits from their previous employers – a Scout might be mustered out of the service with a reserve Scout Ship, for example, or a Marine might get to keep their combat armor and so on. These are determined by Benefit rolls.

Benefits are gained when a Traveller leaves a career. A Traveller gets one Benefit roll for every full term served in that career. You also get extra Benefit rolls if you reached a high rank.

There are two columns for Benefit rolls in each career

- the Cash column and the Other Benefits column. You may only roll on the Cash column a maximum of three times across all your careers.

Benefits of Rank Highest Rank Reached Bonus Benefit Rolls 1–2 1 3–4 2 5–6 3, and DM+1 to all Benefit rolls from this career

CASH BENEFITS A Traveller with the Gambler skill gains DM+1 to all rolls on Cash columns.

If the Traveller has any money left, they may purchase personal equipment worth up to Cr10000 before they start adventuring. More expensive items can be bought in play but Travellers will have to seek them out. Any left-over money can be converted into cash, trade goods or just saved.

OTHER BENEFITS When you leave a career in good standing with your previous employers, you are permitted to keep various pieces of equipment or even shares of a vessel. Different careers grant different Benefits.

**Armor:** Select any type of armor with a limit of Cr10000 and TL12. If you roll this Benefit again, then you can either select another type of armor with the same limits or trade your original in for armor with a limit of Cr25000.

**Ally:** Gain an Ally.

Blade: Select any blade weapon with a limit of Cr1000 and TL12. If you roll this Benefit again, you may take another blade or one level in the Melee (blade) skill.

Characteristic Increases: Increase the listed characteristic by the amount shown, up to your racial maximum. Human characters are limited to a score of

15. Characteristic increases above 15 are lost, with the exception of SOC increases – every point of excess SOC becomes a Ship Share.

**Cybernetic Implant:** Gain any augmentations (see page 106) with a limit of Cr75000 and TL12. If you roll this Benefit again, then you may either take a different augmentation or increase the one you already possess by one level of Improvement as shown on the table on page
| 106 | (this may take it above the Credit and TL limit). |

Contact: Gain a Contact.

Free Trader: You receive a free trader with 25% of the mortgage paid off on it. This free trader is identical to the one on page 194 but you must roll 1D times on the Spacecraft Quirks table on page 188. If you roll this Benefit again, an additional 25% of the mortgage has been paid off – if you roll this Benefit four times, the free trader will have no mortgage and it will be all yours! Alternatively, you may select a far trader (page 196) instead.

Gun: Select any common or military ranged weapon with a limit of Cr3000 and TL12. If you roll this benefit again, you may take another weapon or one level in the appropriate Gun Combat skill for a weapon already received as a Benefit.

L **ab Ship:** You receive a lab ship with 25% of the mortgage paid off on it. This lab ship is identical to the one on page 206 but you must roll 1D times on the

Spacecraft Quirks table on page 188. If you roll this Benefit again, an additional 25% of the mortgage has been paid off – if you roll this Benefit four times, the lab ship will have no mortgage and it will be all yours!

Personal Vehicle: You receive a personal vehicle, such as a ground car or air/raft. You can choose exactly what type of vehicle this is but it may not be armed and has a limit of Cr300000 and TL10. If you roll this Benefit again, gain a level of Drive or Flyer.

Scientific Equipment: Gain any one piece of scientific equipment with a limit of Cr2000 and TL12. If you roll this Benefit again, take another piece of scientific equipment or gain one level in Electronics or Science.

Scout Ship: You receive a scout ship. You have full use of the ship and can modify it as you see fit but it still belongs to the Scout Service and can (and will!) be recalled back into service as needed. This means you will be expected to complete missions for the Scout Service from time-to-time. If you roll this Benefit more than once, re-roll the result.

Ship's Boat: You receive a ship's boat or other small craft with a limit of MCr10 and TL12. If you roll this Benefit again, gain Pilot (small craft). Alternatively, receive a Ship Share instead.

Ship Shares: You obtain one or more Ship Shares that can be put towards obtaining a ship. Each share is worth MCr1 but cannot be redeemed for cash.

Weapon: Select any weapon with a limit of Cr3000 and TL12. If you roll this benefit again, you may take another weapon or one level in the appropriate Melee or Gun Combat skill for a weapon already received as a Benefit.

TAS Membership: You are a member of the Traveller's Aid Society (TAS), a private organization that maintains hostels and facilities at all Class A and B starports in many parts of human space. Facilities are available
(at reasonable cost) to members and their guests. Receipt of membership in the Traveller's Aid Society as a benefit may be construed as a reward for heroism or extraordinary service to the Society rather than an official benefit from a career. Membership is for life and not transferable.

Membership may also be purchased for MCr1, although it is possible for an application to be 'black-balled' by an existing member. The Traveller's Aid Society is an exclusive organization, made up of those who are truly citizens of the galaxy, not just a single world.

The TAS invests its membership fees and other incomes; it uses its capital and return to provide benefits to its members. Every two months, it pays dividends in the form of one high passage (see page 158) to each member. This passage may be used, retained or sold.

Membership may only be received once per Traveller. If you roll this Benefit again, receive two Ship Shares instead.

Yacht: You receive a yacht with 25% of the mortgage paid off on it. This yacht is identical to the one on page
| 202 | but you must roll 1D times on the Spacecraft Quirks | table on page 188. If you roll this Benefit again, an additional 25% of the mortgage has been paid off – if you roll this benefit four times, the yacht will have no mortgage and it will be all yours! Alternatively, you may select a Safari Ship instead (see page 198).

SHIP SHARES Ship Shares represent contacts, credit rating, savings and favors owed that a Traveller can put towards ownership of a space vessel, worth roughly one million Credits. Travellers can pool their Ship Shares towards the use of a vessel but cannot trade Ship Shares for cash. It is very unlikely that the Travellers will be able to own anything but the smallest starship outright at the start of the game, so most crews end up working to support a mortgage on their spacecraft. The more Ship Shares that a group of Travellers can put together, the bigger a ship they can afford.

See the Spacecraft Operations chapter for more on ship mortgages and how Ship Shares can be applied against them.

Pensions A Traveller that leaves a career (other than Scout, Rogue, Prisoner or Drifter) after at least five terms is considered to have retired and receives a pension. This pension is paid at the beginning of each year, effective upon leaving the service and may be collected at any Class A or B starport.

Terms Pay
| 5 | Cr10000 |
| 6 | Cr12000 |
| 7 | Cr14000 |
| 8 | Cr16000 | 9+ Cr2000 per term beyond 8

AGEING The effects of ageing begin when a Traveller reaches 34 years of age (at the end of their fourth career term). At the end of the fourth term and at the end of every term thereafter, the Traveller must roll 2D on the Ageing table. Use the Traveller's total number of terms as a negative DM on this table; the older you are, the heavier the effects of ageing will weigh upon you.

The Traveller may choose which characteristics are affected by ageing.

SHIPS WITH BENEFITS There are several ways of starting a Traveller with a ship after completing careers, although it is difficult. However, for simplicity and balance, only one Traveller may start with a ship in their possession before the campaign begins. If two or more Travellers have gained ships, you should debate who actually gets a ship. The other Travellers will receive an additional pension of Cr25000 every year for each time they rolled a ship as a benefit. This represents part ownership in a commercial vessel and the dividends received on the investment.

While individual Ship Shares cannot be redeemed for cash either, if they are not used to help purchase a ship the Traveller will instead receive an additional pension of Cr1000 every year (they might not be in possession of the ship but it is somewhere out there in the galaxy, earning dividends for those who invested in it, possibly many years ago).

**Ageing**

2D Effects of Ageing
-6 Reduce three physical characteristics by 2, reduce one mental characteristic by 1
-5 Reduce three physical characteristics by 2
-4 Reduce two physical characteristics by 2, reduce one physical characteristic by 1
-3 Reduce one physical characteristic by 2, reduce two physical characteristic by 1
-2 Reduce three physical characteristics by 1
-1 Reduce two physical characteristics by 1 0 Reduce one physical characteristic by 1 1+ No effect

**Ageing Crisis:** If any characteristic is reduced to 0, then the Traveller suffers an ageing crisis. The Traveller dies unless they pay 1D x Cr10000 for medical care, which will bring any characteristics back up to 1. The Traveller automatically fails any qualification rolls from now on.

**Anagathics:** At the start of any career term, a Traveller can start taking anagathics by rolling SOC 10+ (if you roll 2 exactly, you must instead go straight to the Prisoner career in this term). While using anagathic drugs, the Traveller effectively does not age – add the number of terms since the Traveller started taking anagathics as a positive DM to rolls on the Ageing table. If a Traveller stops taking anagathics for any reason in the future, then they must roll immediately on the Ageing table as the shock of their system beginning to age again strikes.

Anagathics have two drawbacks. First, the combined risk of trying to obtain a reliable supply and the disruption to their biochemistry means the Traveller must make two Survival checks in each term instead of one. If either or both checks are failed, the Traveller suffers a Mishap.

Second, the drugs cost 1D x Cr25000 for each term the Traveller uses the drugs. These costs are paid out of the Traveller's eventual cash benefits. If the Traveller cannot pay these bills, they go into debt – see Medical Bills.

**Ageing and Anagathics During Play:** If your campaign lasts long enough, Travellers will have to make further ageing rolls every four years. Travellers may also seek out anagathic drugs during a campaign – in fact, if a Traveller started using anagathics during creation, they may be driven to seek them out as a matter of necessity or be faced with sudden rapid ageing. See Anagathic Drugs on page 115 for more details.

INJURIES Travellers wounded in combat or accidents during creation must roll on the Injury table to see how bad their injuries are.

Injury 1D Injury
| 1 | Nearly killed – reduce one physical characteristic by 1D, reduce two other physical characteristics by 2. |
| 2 | Severely injured – reduce one physical characteristic by 1D. |
| 3 | Missing Eye or Limb – reduce STR or DEX by 2. |
| 4 | Scarred – you are scarred and injured. Reduce any physical characteristic by 2. |
| 5 | Injured. Reduce any physical characteristic by 1. |
| 6 | Lightly Injured. No permanent effect. |

Medical Care: If you have been injured, then medical care may be able to undo the effects of the damage. Some worlds have the technology to clone or rebuild damaged organs; others specialize in transplants or cybernetic replacements. Regardless of the technique used, medical care is expensive.

The restoration of a lost characteristic costs Cr5000 per point.

If you were injured in the service of an organization, then a portion of your medical care may be paid for. Roll 2D on the Medical Bills table, adding your rank as a DM.

Medical Bills Career Roll of 4+ Roll of 8+ Roll of 12+ Army/Navy/Marine 75% 100% 100% Agent/Noble/ Scholar/Entertainer/ Merchant/Citizen

50% 75% 100%

Scout/Rogue/Drifter 0% 50% 75%

For example, Morn suffers an injury during his career as a barbarian, reducing his STR by 2. He has the limb regrown at a starport hospital, at the cost of Cr10000. He has to pay this entire amount himself – but has no money. Morn starts the game with a Cr10000 debt to the hospital.

Any debt left is hanging over you at the start of the game and you can be sure it will be collected, likely with interest.

WHY ARE YOU TRAVELLING? The final step of creation is to choose your Traveller's initial goal – why are they travelling? The lure of the unknown? The chance to strike it rich? Running from their past? Loyalty to another Traveller?

At this stage of creation, you have guided your Traveller from their teenage years to the present day. Who are they? How has their past shaped their beliefs? What cause are they willing to fight for? Do they have any odd tics or habits? What do they want?

ALIENS Up to now, we have only considered human Travellers. However, many Traveller universes also contain numerous non-human sophonts – aliens.

Other universes will detail the aliens that can be Travellers and the Aliens of Charted Space books add more but, to get you started, here are two commonly found in the Third Imperium; the Aslan and Vargr.

CREATING ALIEN TRAVELLERS Alien Travellers are created in the same way as humans but with the following two differences.

Aliens have modifiers applied to some of their characteristics as soon as they are rolled. This may take them above the normal maximum of 15 but cannot take a characteristic to less than 1.

Aliens have traits, or special rules, that mark them as different.

Both of these are detailed for each alien species in their descriptions.

You can find out more on playing aliens in the Aliens of Charted Space books but presented here are everything you need to create Aslan and Vargr Travellers in the Third Imperium. It should be noted that while aliens have their own cultures and societies that can powerfully affect their career choices (some aliens even have their own unique careers), those created with this book are assumed to have grown up within the Third Imperium itself, among humans and adopting human ways, and so they use the same careers detailed in this chapter.

PRISONER CAREERS The Prisoner is a special career that Travellers cannot enter voluntarily. Instead, they may be forced to spend time in this career through various events in other careers. A Traveller is free to pick a new assignment in the career every term.

LEAVING THE PRISONER CAREER A Traveller may not normally leave or be ejected from this career – not even Mishaps will force them to leave. Instead, they have a value called a Parole Threshold. At the end of each term in the prisoner career, if the Traveller's advancement roll is greater than their Parole Threshold, it means their prison sentence has come to an end and they leave this career. Otherwise, they may not leave this career and must continue in it for another term.

A Traveller's Parole Threshold starts at 1D+2. A Traveller's Parole Threshold can never go above 12.

ANAGATHICS Travellers may not use Anagathics in prison.

Aslan Dewclaw

**ASLAN** The Aslan are the youngest of the great powers, an expansionist species of feuding clans and predatory warriors, eager to seize all the universe has to offer. Aslan are descended from four-limbed carnivorous pouncer stock, which was originally near the top of the food chain in the forests of their homeworld, Kusyu. True to their pouncer ancestry, Aslan are capable of short bursts of speed somewhat greater

than that manageable by humans. They also have slightly superior hearing and night vision. Otherwise, they are one of the most human-like of all alien species, excepting, of course, the Vargr (who are, after all, genetically-altered mammalian stock originally from Earth).

Early Terran explorers regarded the Aslan as 'lion- like' and the simile has stuck ever since, although the Aslan bear only a passing resemblance to terrestrial lions. Nonetheless, this early misnomer has influenced a great deal of human thinking about the Aslan, including terminology (the use of pride to translate ahriy, for instance) and ascribed behaviour – which is not at all leonine.

Characteristics Aslan Travellers have the following modifiers applied to their characteristics: STR+2, DEX-2.

Traits Aslan Travellers all possess the following traits:

Dewclaw: All Aslan have a dewclaw, which can be extended to make for a vicious close combat weapon. The dewclaw uses the Melee (natural) skill and does 1D+2 damage.

Heightened Senses: Aslan have better night vision, hearing and sense of smell than humans. All Aslan receive DM+1 to any Recon and Survival checks they have to make.

Vargr Canines

VARGR The Vargr are the only Major Race to have been uplifted by the Ancients, a fact that the Vargr are extremely proud of. They are typically seen by other species as aggressive pirates and scavengers but the Vargr actually have a diverse culture that is deeply rooted in their pack mentality and the desire for companionship, charisma and loyalty. Their constant struggle for charisma and leadership results in a culture fuelled by conflict and change.

The Vargr are descended from carnivore/chaser stock; genetically engineered by the Ancients circa
-300,000 from the genus Canis. The carnivores were transplanted from Terra to Lair/Grnouf in the Provence sector. The Vargr bear a close resemblance to their canine ancestry, as can be seen by their muzzle, tail and fur, although several anatomical modifications were made by the Ancients to the canine body structure. Vargr adopt a digitigrade stance (putting their weight on their toes rather than the soles of their feet) and many have a slight stoop.

Characteristics Vargr Travellers have the following modifiers applied to their characteristics: STR-1, DEX+1, END-1.

Traits Vargr Travellers all possess the following traits:

Bite: All Vargr possess pronounced canines, which make for a nasty close combat weapon. This bite uses the Melee (natural) skill and does 1D+1 damage.

Heightened Senses: Vargr have better hearing and sense of smell than humans. All Vargr receive DM+1 to any Recon and Survival checks they have to make. However, their eyesight is worse in darkness and they suffer DM-1 to any skill check requiring sight in dark conditions.

POST CAREER EDUCATION Once a Traveller leaves their career and begins to wander the stars, they will have every opportunity for adventure and excitement. All these possibilities may leave the Traveller thinking they are not adequately prepared for this life and the idea of continuing their education may come to mind.

Education in the far future is accessible to everyone and ranges from finding teachers in remote star systems who grant secret knowledge, to a plethora of distance learning courses that Travellers can diligently follow to increase their skills and abilities.

This is all handled by training, which gives a Traveller the opportunity to increase existing skills and learn new ones.

**TRAINING** In order to train for a new skill, or improve an existing one, a Traveller must commit to a Study Period. A Study Period is equal to eight weeks (or two months) of study and practice. These weeks within a Study Period need not be consecutive but each week must be fully dedicated to study with at least eight hours per day spent learning and practicing.

If this cannot be achieved, if the Traveller is interrupted on the third day of a week and must perform a task for a patron, for example, then any training performed that week is wasted. Make a note for every week of training that is completed – an area for this has been set aside on the Traveller character sheet.

Once eight weeks of training and learning have been accumulated, over any length of total time, a Study Period has been completed.

At this point, the Traveller must succeed at an Average
(8+) EDU check.

Success indicates the Traveller has learned something and if they were attempting to learn a brand new skill at level 0, they can now add that to their character sheet.

Failure indicates the Traveller has learned nothing new or useful but may try again after another successful Study Period.

To improve skills to the next higher level, the Traveller must accumulate a number of successful Study Periods equal to the level of skill they are trying to reach. For example, if a Traveller had Electronics (computers) 1 and was trying to learn Electronics (computers) 2, this would require two successful Study Periods.

Many Travellers take the opportunity of week-long jump travel to study, learning new skills during what might otherwise be a dull journey.

It is important to note that failing a Study Period does not necessarily mean the Traveller has not understood the study materials, just that they failed to get anything useful out of them. A Traveller failing their EDU check while studying Science (physics) during jump travel, for example, might find the captain of the ship is constantly ordering them to clean the cargo deck, they might be distracted by a hobby or new vid show, or they might just be spending their time sitting in their bunk eating Sugary Puff sandwiches while reading What Space Bike? Magazine when they really should be studying...

LIMITATIONS Remember, your Traveller may have a maximum number of skill levels equal to three times their combined INT and EDU score. If they already have this many skills after leaving a career, any additional skills may only be learned to level 0.

EXCEPTIONS There are a number of exceptions that must be kept in mind when learning new skills.

•  The Jack-of-all-Trades skill may never be learned or improved.
•  The Athletics skill may be learned or improved but does not use EDU. Instead, use the appropriate physical characteristics (STR, DEX or END). Any physical characteristic can be used to gain Athletics 0.

# SKILLS AND TASKS

Every Traveller will acquire a variety of skills during creation that will indicate the tasks they perform well.

•  If a Traveller has no level in a skill at all, then they are untrained and will suffer DM-3 when trying to use that skill.
•  If a Traveller has zero level in a skill (Skill 0), then they are competent in using that skill but have probably had little experience in actually using it. They do not get any bonus from their skill level but at least avoid the penalty for being untrained.
•  If a Traveller has one or more levels in a skill (Skill 1, Skill 2, and so on.) then they are trained in that skill. Each level represents several years of experience using that skill and grants DM+1 per level to all skill checks using that skill. A Traveller with level 2–3 in a skill is a skilled professional in that field. A Traveller with level 4 or 5 is probably both well-respected and well-known in their field.

For example, a Traveller with Medic 1 may be a paramedic or nurse, while another Traveller with Medic 2 might be a doctor. If a Traveller had Medic 3, they would likely be a very well-regarded doctor with many years of practice under their belt. A Traveller with Medic 4 or 5 would be at least world-renowned and may well be known across several star systems for their expertise.

SPECIALTIES Some skills have specialities – specialized, more focused forms of that skill. A Traveller picks a speciality when they gain level 1 in a skill that has two or more specialities.

For example, a Traveller might have Engineer 0, allowing them to make Engineer skill checks without the unskilled penalty. They might then gain a level in Engineer, at which point they would need to choose a speciality. For Engineer, this is a choice between j-drive, m-drive, power plant and life support.

If they choose j-drive, they would record this on their character sheet as Engineer (j-drive) 1. They would then make all Engineer checks involving jump drives at

DM+1 but would still make all other Engineer checks at DM+0 (in other words, with no penalty). A Traveller can have multiple specialities in a skill – they might have Engineer (j-drive) 1 and Engineer (power plant) 2. They would therefore make checks related to jump drives with DM+1, checks related to power plants with DM+2 and all other Engineer checks with DM+0.

TASK CHECKS Most actions undertaken by Travellers do not require a skill check. A Traveller does not have to make an Athletics check to run through a forest or Electronics
(computers) to access information from their ship's library. Some actions will require the Traveller to have a particular skill but will still not require a check. A Traveller with Flyer 0, for example, can fly an air/raft under normal conditions without having to make a check.

The referee should only call for checks when:

•  The Travellers are in danger.
•  The task is especially difficult or hazardous.
•  The Travellers are under the pressure of time.
•  Success or failure is especially important or interesting.

MAKING CHECKS To make a check, the Traveller rolls 2D and includes any appropriate Dice Modifiers (DM). If the total is 8 or more, the Traveller succeeds.

The most common forms of task checks are characteristic checks and skill checks.

CHARACTERISTIC CHECKS The Traveller adds their characteristic DM. For example:

•  When forcing open a sealed door on a derelict ship, a Traveller would use their STR Dice Modifier.
•  When balancing on a narrow beam, a Traveller would use their DEX Dice Modifier.
•  When trying to endure a long trek through the desert, a Traveller would use their END Dice Modifier.
•  When trying to decipher an alien puzzle-box, a Traveller uses their INT Dice Modifier.

•  When attempting to remember some trivia or piece of common knowledge, a Traveller uses their EDU Dice Modifier.
•  When trying to impress a guard with their wealth or position, a Traveller uses their SOC Dice Modifier.

**SKILL CHECKS** For a skill check, the Traveller adds both their skill level and, if appropriate, a characteristic DM. The combination of skill and characteristic varies depending on the situation, as chosen by the referee:

•  Shooting a gun would use the appropriate Gun Combat skill and the Traveller's DEX Dice Modifier.
•  Repairing a damaged gun might use Gun Combat and EDU.
•  Trying to work out what sort of gun caused a particular wound might use Gun Combat and INT
(or perhaps Investigate and INT).
•  Hiding from an enemy soldier would call for Stealth and DEX, while staying still for a long time to avoid detection would be a Stealth plus END check.
•  Just generally carousing at a party might use Carouse on its own, without any particular characteristic. If the Traveller wants to beat

someone in a drinking contest, then they might use Carouse and END; spotting who is out of place at a party would be Carouse and INT, and snubbing someone might use Carouse and SOC.

If a Traveller does not have any levels in a skill used in a check, they suffer DM-3 on the check for being unskilled.

To summarise;

To make a normal (Average) skill check, a Traveller rolls 2D + Skill Level + Characteristic DM + any other relevant DMs and must get a total of 8 or more to succeed.

For example, Kathya (DEX 10, Stealth 0), Erik (DEX 6, Stealth 2) and Morn (DEX 12, no Stealth) are all trying to sneak down a corridor. Kathya has DEX DM+1 and while she gets no DM from only having Stealth 0, she at least avoids the unskilled penalty. Her final modifier is DM+1; she rolls 2D+1 and tries to get 8 or more. Erik has DEX DM+0 but has Stealth 2. His final modifier is DM+2; he rolls 2D+2 and tries to get 8 or more. Morn is more dexterous than either of his companions, with his DEX DM+2. However, he has no Stealth skill at all and so suffers DM-3 for being unskilled. His final modifier is DM-1, so he rolls 2D-1 and tries to get 8 or more.

TASK DIFFICULTIES Some tasks are easier or harder to complete than others and so far we have just looked at Average checks that need 8+ to succeed. When the referee decides a task should be either easier or harder, they may change the target number needed for the check.

Simple tasks are trivial for everyone. A Simple task might be requesting weather data from a standard tourist computer system, ordering a meal in a language you know well or sneaking up on a drugged guard. Simple tasks require a 2 or more to be rolled for the check if, indeed, they are rolled for at all.

CALLING FOR TASK CHECKS Often, if the Travellers have the requisite skills the referee can just assume they succeed. For example, if the Travellers are trying to find an informant in a city you could keep calling for Streetwise or Carouse checks until they succeed but that is dull; you will just have the Traveller rolling dice until they can move on. However, if failure carries a consequence – say, a failed check will result in the Travellers picking up a false rumor – then it is a good time to call for a skill check.

WHICH CHARACTERISTIC? The characteristic that applies to a skill check will be obvious in most cases – balancing atop a wall is blatantly a DEX-based check, while using brute force to disable a mechanism is governed by STR. The main area of overlap is between INT and EDU. The former covers inspiration, improvization and pure reasoning, while the latter is for trained responses and known solutions. For example, a brilliant but unschooled mechanic might fix a ship using Engineer and INT, while a trained mechanic might follow the procedure in the book using Engineer and EDU. Some checks can be attempted with either characteristic but no amount of EDU will help you deal with a totally unfamiliar problem and no amount of INT will let a Traveller know some piece of trivia or technical information unless they learned it beforehand.

Easy tasks are trivial for a trained professional and simple for an amateur. An Easy task might be hiking cross-country for a few hours, holding a ship in perfectly level flight, or activating an unfamiliar device that has a clear and simple interface. Easy tasks require a 4 or more to be rolled for the check.

A Routine task is trivial for a trained professional and relatively easy even for an amateur. A Routine task might be hitting a prone victim in melee, landing a ship in optimum conditions with computer assistance, translating a newspaper and so on. Routine tasks require a 6 or more to be rolled for the check.

An Average task is a moderate obstacle to a trained professional. Shooting a gun accurately at range, plotting the jump calculations for a starship, repairing a damaged circuit board or finding a buyer for a cargo bay full of machine parts on an industrial world are all examples of Average tasks, which require the normal 8 or more to be rolled for the check.

A Difficult task is tough even for a trained professional. Examples might be making an accurate shot in the middle of a ferocious storm, defending a client in court when they are clearly guilty, hacking into a secure computer network or spotting the flash of sunlight reflecting off a sniper's scope. Difficult tasks require a 10 or more to be rolled for the check.

Very Difficult tasks are hard for a trained professional and nearly impossible for an amateur. They require a 12 or more to be rolled for the check.

Formidable tasks are exceptionally hard, such as performing surgery on an alien of radically different biology, hacking a military-grade computer network, disarming a terrorist bomb or convincing a city of superstitious natives that you are a peaceful trader and not a demon from the outer darkness when you do not speak a word of their language. Formidable tasks require a 14 or more to be rolled for the check.

Impossible tasks require near-miracles to pull off, such reconstructing alien DNA, rebuilding a worldwide military-grade computer network from scratch or flying a starship through an area of space filled with treacherous stellar phenomena in record-beating time. Impossible tasks require a 16 or more to be rolled for the check.

These difficulties are summarized on the Task Difficulty table.

**Task Difficulty**

Difficulty Target Number Simple 2+ Easy 4+ Routine 6+ Average 8+ Difficult 10+ Very Difficult 12+ Formidable 14+ Impossible 16+

_For example, Erik (INT 9, Carouse 1) is trying to find_ information about a mysterious ship that landed at the starport. He goes to a bar frequented by wanderers and spacers, hoping to pick up a rumor. This is a Carouse _check and the referee says that it is a Difficult (10+) task._ Erik has one level of Carouse, which grants him DM+1, _an INT of 9 (for an additional DM+1), giving him a final of_ DM+2. He rolls 2D+2 and tries to get 10 or more.

Note that if no difficulty is listed for a check, you can always assume it is Average (8+).

BOON AND BANE The task difficulty levels allow a referee to pre-plan the skill and characteristic checks Travellers will need to succeed in during an adventure. However, there will likely be situations that arise that will make things either easier or harder for the Travellers. This is where Boons and Banes come in.

If a Traveller has help, such as good tools, competent aids or other beneficial circumstances, they receive a Boon. This means they roll an extra dice during a check and discard the lowest.

If a Traveller is hindered in a check, such as with poor tools, a dimly lit environment or other negative circumstances, they receive a Bane. This means they roll an extra dice during a check and discard the highest.

A Traveller can only be under the influence of one Boon or Bane during any one check. If they receive both a Boon and a Bane for the same check, they cancel out and no extra dice are rolled. At the same time, if they receive multiple Boons or Banes, they will only be subject to one.

EFFECT For most situations, the only thing that needs to be determined is whether or not the Traveller succeeds. If the Traveller's total throw after applying all Dice Modifiers equals or exceeds the target difficulty (eight or more for an Average check), they succeed. If it is less, they fail.

Often, however, it is important to know how well the Traveller did – or how bad. To do this, subtract the target number from the dice roll of the check, including any modifiers. This margin of success (or failure) is the Effect that can be consulted on the Effect Results table. This is also used in combat to calculate damage (see below).

For example, if a Traveller rolls a 4 and a 3 for an Average (8+) check, then applies DM+3 for a total of 10, their Effect is (10 – 8) 2.

**Effect Results**

Effect Success or Failure
-6 or less

Exceptional Failure: The Traveller failed as completely as it is possible to fail. Anything that can go wrong goes wrong. If attempting to repair a device, the device is further damaged or even destroyed. In a social situation, the Traveller gets into further trouble.
-2 to -5 Average Failure: The Traveller has failed the task.
-1 Marginal Failure: The Traveller has almost succeeded and the referee may permit them to scrape a success if they take a significant consequence. A Traveller trying to jump across a chasm hangs onto the far side by their fingernails but can only pull themselves up if they drop their backpack. A Traveller trying to land a ship can bring it down safely but the ship may never fly again. A Traveller hacking a computer gets in but the security programs can trace their location. 0 Marginal Success: The Traveller barely succeeds at the task and may have to accept a condition on their success. They fix the engine but it will overheat. They find a buyer for the goods but the buyer is an untrustworthy criminal. 1 to 5 Average Success: The Traveller succeeds normally. 6 or more Exceptional Success: The Traveller succeeds in an impressive and elegant fashion.

OPPOSED CHECKS If two or more Travellers are opposing one another directly in a task or if a Traveller is directly opposing another character, an opposed check is made. Both Travellers or characters make their task checks as normal, with the winner being the one with the highest Effect.

In the case of a draw, the two opponents are locked into standstill with neither gaining an advantage – they may try again or events may overtake them rendering the opposed check meaningless.

MULTIPLE TASKS A Traveller can try to do two or more things at once, like firing a spacecraft's weapons while also flying, or disarming a bomb while hiding from guards. For every extra thing the Traveller is doing, the level of difficulty for each task is made one level harder. So, an Easy task becomes Routine, while a Very Difficult task becomes Formidable.

TIMEFRAMES Each task has a random timeframe of one to six time units. The unit depends on the task – shooting someone or throwing a punch takes 1D seconds, while prepping an air/raft for flight might take 1D minutes,

looking for rumors on the street might take 1D hours and repairing a damaged component on a ship might take 1D x 10 hours.

Some sample timeframes are listed in the Timeframes table. The referee can use these examples for their own checks and actions.

Timeframes Timeframe Increment Example Action 1D Seconds One second Shooting, punching, jumping 1D Combat Rounds

Combat round
(six seconds)

Hurrying a maths problem 1D x 10 Seconds

Ten seconds Rerouting power, opening a comms channel 1D Minutes One minute Applying first aid, basic technical tasks 1D x 10 Minutes

Ten minutes More complex technical tasks, searching an area thoroughly 1D Hours One hour Building a shelter, moving through the wilderness 1D x 4 Hours Four hours Researching a problem 1D x 10 Hours

Ten hours Repairing a damaged ship 1D Days One day Combing a city for a missing person

**GOING FASTER OR SLOWER** You can choose, before you roll, to move up or down one level on the Timeframes table. Moving up (reducing the time increment) inflicts DM-2 on your check; moving down and increasing the time taken gives you DM+2 on your check. You can only move a time increment one level in this way.

_For example, Kathya is trying to fix a damaged jump_ engine in the middle of a battle. Repairing the engine would normally take 1D hours but an enemy ship is _closing fast and they need to jump as soon as possible. Kathya therefore decides to increase the difficulty and suffer a DM-2 to her check in order to reduce the time_ by one step. Instead of 1D hours, it will only take 1D x 10 minutes. She rolls a 3 for the timeframe, so it takes her 30 minutes to repair the engines.

_The ship jumps successfully but the engine needs_ more repairs. A week later, when they emerge from hyperspace, Kathya overhauls the engine. This time, there is no time pressure, so she opts to increase the time taken from 1D hours to 1D x 4 hours to make the task easier, giving her DM+2. She rolls a 3 for the timeframe again, so it takes her 12 hours to repair the engines properly.

TASK CHAINS Often, Travellers will find themselves performing a series of interlinked tasks or working as a group.

Finding a buyer for a cargo of illegal goods, for example, calls for a Streetwise check to find a fence, then a Broker check to negotiate a price. The result of the Streetwise check could conceivably influence the quality and competence of the fence, which will affect the Broker check.

Alternatively, when coming up with a plan to attack a fortress, the Travellers would begin with a Recon check to scope the place out, then a Tactics check to find weak spots in its defences, then Stealth and Electronics checks to get past the security system. The quality of information gleaned from the Recon check will certainly have an impact on the tactics the Travellers choose to adopt and this in turn will make their Stealth checks easier or harder, and so on.

When tasks are linked together like this they are called task chains and the result of one check can give a DM to the next – for better or worse. The DM gleaned from one check and then applied to the next is shown on the Task Chain table.

**Task Chain**

Previous Check

DM to Current Check Previous Check

DM to Current Check Failed With Effect -6 or less

-3 Succeeded With Effect 0

+1

Failed With Effect -2 to -5

-2 Succeeded With Effect 1 to 5

+2

Failed With Effect -1

-1 Succeeded With Effect 6 or more

+3

For example, Erik and Kathya are trying to locate a hidden base on an icy moon. Erik has Electronics
(computers) and suggests trying to augment their ship's scanners. Kathya has the Electronics (sensors) skill and stays on the bridge while Erik goes down to the sensor pods with his toolkit.

Firstly, Erik makes his Electronics (computers) check. He gets Effect 5, which grants DM+2 to the next task in the chain. Kathya will now make her Electronics
(sensors) check with DM+2 thanks to Erik's efforts.

Chains of linked task checks can be formed.

To continue the previous example, if Morn were then to use his Science (geology) skill to determine which of the heat traces from Kathya's sensor readings were the result of natural geological activity and which were heat exhausts from a hidden base, then Kathya's Sensors check would be the previous check in the chain leading to his Science (geology) check and so her Effect would grant a DM for his check.

Travellers need not rely on one another to create a task chain. One Traveller working diligently on something that requires multiple checks can potentially link them together into a task chain if the referee agrees that one check can affect the next.

WORKING TOGETHER Task chains usually assume that while Travellers are working together, they are waiting for the results of one check in order to affect the next. However, there will be times when Travellers are working at the same time on exactly the same task and will wish to combine their efforts.

In these situations, the task chain rules can still be used but with one Traveller making the 'final' check and the others making checks to add task chain modifiers.

For example, Erik and Kathya are trying to force open a locked door within a smuggler's asteroid lair with brute strength. Erik is the strongest with STR 9 and so he puts his shoulder into the door but fears he alone mighty not be enough. Kathya has STR 7 and helps. Kathya makes an STR check and consults the Task Chain table in order to provide a DM to Erik's STR check, which will determine whether the door is forced open or not.

DIFFICULTY, BOON/BANE AND DMS There are three factors that can affect a check in Traveller; Task Difficulty, Boons and Banes, and Dice Modifiers. However, all three are used in very specific circumstances and referees should use the following principles when applying them.

Difficulty: Before any other factors are taken into account, the referee should set the difficulty of a task, based on how hard they believe the task should be without any exterior effects. For example, making a phone call is a Simple task and remains so, even if a Traveller is hanging upside down from a spacecraft flying through a storm.

Dice Modifiers: In general, these should be regarded as being 'hard-wired' into the rules and only applied if they are listed in a Traveller rulebook or supplement.

Boon and Bane: If an exterior factor is influencing the task, for better or worse, then a Boon or Bane is applied to the check. Making a phone call while hanging upside down from a spacecraft is a good example of a Bane being applied. Boons and Banes are applied only at the prerogative of the referee and will never appear within any rulebook or published adventure. They are intended to be used on the fly to quickly provide an advantage or disadvantage to Travellers.

In the vast majority of cases, a referee simply need set a Task Difficulty and then decide whether a Boon or Bane need be applied. Any necessary Dice Modifiers will be suggested by the rules.

Each Skill is described using the following format.

Description: What the skill does. Specialities: If the skill has several specialities, they are listed here. When a Traveller reaches level 1 in a skill, they must take a speciality in that skill at level 1. When they gain another level in the skill, they may increase that speciality to level 2 or take a different speciality. Most skills have no specialities. Common Checks: Common uses for the skill and what time increment, characteristic DM and difficulty are associated with those uses.

Admin This skill covers bureaucracies and administration of all sorts, including the navigation of bureaucratic obstacles or disasters. It also covers tracking inventories, ship manifests and other records.

**Jack-of-All-Trades** The Jack-of-All-Trades skill works differently to other skills. It reduces the unskilled penalty a Traveller receives for not having the appropriate skill by one for every level of Jack-of-All-Trades. For example, if a Traveller does not have the Pilot skill, they suffer DM-3 to all Pilot checks. If that Traveller has Jack- of-All-Trades 2, then the penalty is reduced by 2 to DM-1. With Jack-of-All-Trades 3, a Traveller can totally negate the penalty for being unskilled.

There is no benefit for having Jack-of-All-Trades 0 or Jack-of-All-Trades 4 or higher.

**Language** There are numerous different Language specialities, each one covering reading and writing in a different language. All Travellers can speak and read their native language without needing the Language skill and automated computer translator programs mean Language skills are not always needed on other worlds. Having Language 0 implies the Traveller has a smattering of simple phrases in a few common languages.

**Specialities** There are, of course, as many specialities of Language as there are actual languages. Those presented here are examples from the Third Imperium setting.
•  Galanglic: The common trade language of the Third Imperium, derived originally from the English spoken in the Rule of Man.
•  **Vilani:** The language spoken by the Vilani of the First Imperium; the 'Latin' of the Third Imperium.

•  Spacecraft: Trade ships and other vessels between 100 and 5,000 tons.
•  [[Capital]] Ships: Battleships and other ships over 5,000 tons.

Profession A Traveller with a Profession skill is trained in producing useful goods or services. There are many different Profession specialities but each one works the same way – the Traveller can make a Profession check to earn money on a planet that supports that trade. The amount of money raised is Cr250 x the Effect of the check per month. Unlike other skills with specialties, levels in the Profession skill do not grant the ability to use other specialties at level 0. Each specialty must be learned individually. Someone with a Profession skill of 0 has a general grasp of working for a living but little experience beyond the most menial jobs.

There are a huge range of potential specialities for this skill, one for every possible profession in the universe. Some examples suitable to a science fiction setting are given here. Also note that on some worlds other skills, such as Animals or Electronics (computers), may be used to earn a living in the same manner as Profession skills.

Vacc Suit The Vacc Suit skill allows a Traveller to wear and operate spacesuits and environmental suits. A Traveller will rarely need to make Vacc Suit checks under ordinary circumstances – merely possessing the skill is enough. If the Traveller does not have the requisite Vacc Suit skill for the suit they are wearing, they suffer DM-2 to all skill checks made while wearing a suit for each missing level. This skill also permits a Traveller to operate advanced battle armor.

Performing a Systems Check on Battle Dress: Average
(8+) Vacc Suit check (1D minutes, EDU).

# COMBAT

As the Travellers journey through the cities and wilds of worlds they visit, they will encounter both sophonts and beasts. While battle involving high-powered technological weaponry is often best avoided, at times the only way encounters can be dealt with is by force. Combat in Traveller is designed to be deadly, especially if there is a gap in technology between combatants.

The combat system is based on the skill system. Firing a gun, swinging a sword or ordering troops into battle are all skill checks; respectively, Gun Combat, Melee and Leadership checks. The main difference between combat and a regular skill check is that timing and situational awareness play a much bigger part in combat. Travellers will have to move between cover and avoid being hit by the lethal weaponry common on the battlefields of the far future.

Firing a gun, swinging a sword or throwing a grenade are all combat actions but a combat action need not be an attack – jamming communications, giving orders or applying first aid are also combat actions.

INITIATIVE At the start of any combat, every Traveller makes either a DEX or INT check (it pays to be quick of the hand or quick of the mind). The Effect of this check is their Initiative for the duration of the combat and will reflect when they get to act in a combat round. Those with higher Initiatives act quicker than those with lower Effects.

Travellers may freely delay their action until later in the turn. The Initiative check simply indicates the first opportunity to act.

OPPOSING FORCES If they so wish, the referee may make just one DEX or INT check for all of the forces under their control, using the highest DEX or INT score of the characters they control. This will speed up the game a great deal, especially if there are many characters fighting the Travellers.

AMBUSHES With high-powered weaponry routinely available in Traveller, victory in battle will often go to the side that has managed to surprise or ambush its enemy.

If one side is aware of the presence of the other but the other is unaware that they are nearby, then an ambush has taken place.

The side that is aware that combat is about to begin gains DM+6 to its Initiative check for the first round only. The side that is not aware it is about to be attacked suffers DM-6 for the first round only.

TACTICS So long as they are not surprised, one Traveller (or character under the referee's control) may make a Tactics check at the start of a combat. The Effect of this check is then applied to the Initiative of everyone on the same side.

MAPS The referee may prepare detailed maps or even models of battlefields and encounter areas or just use sketch maps or descriptions. However, in most simple firefights, you should find this is not necessary.

Traveller uses a scale of 1.5 meters per map square or hex for personal combat.

In most combats, the combatants begin at Medium range. See page 74 for more details about range.

THE COMBAT ROUND Each combat round lasts around six seconds of game time.

In each combat round, each Traveller may perform a Minor Action and a Significant Action. Travellers take these actions in Initiative order, starting with those who rolled the highest Initiative check. If two or more Travellers are acting on the same Initiative order, the one with the highest DEX score will go first. If they are still tied, they will act simultaneously.

When it is a Traveller's turn to act, they take both their Minor and Significant Actions at the same time before play moves onto another Traveller.

Once every Traveller has had a chance to act the combat round is over and a new combat round begins. Every Traveller retains the same Initiative score for every combat round.

SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS A Traveller may perform one Significant Action in every combat round, chosen from those below.

ATTACK The most common Significant Action used in combat is to attack. An attack is an attempt to damage or injure an enemy with either a melee or ranged weapon, such as a knife or a rifle.

The Traveller declares they are going to attack and selects a target. The target may then choose a Reaction. The Traveller then makes an appropriate skill check and, as normal for any Average skill check, if they score 8+, the attack is successful and damage is dealt to the target (see Damage on page 77).

ACTION SUMMARY In every round a Traveller can...

•  Perform one Significant Action and one Minor Action.

Or

•  Perform up to three Minor Actions.

They may also...

•  Perform any number of Reactions.
•  Perform any number of Free Actions
(although the referee is free to impose a limit according to circumstances).

The standard skill checks used when making an attack are as follows.

Melee Attack 2D + Melee (appropriate speciality) +STR or DEX DM

Ranged Attack 2D + Gun Combat (appropriate speciality) + DEX DM

Some ranged weapons will use a skill other than Gun Combat. A rocket launcher, for example, will use Heavy Weapons (portable), while grenades and any other weapons that are thrown will use Athletics (dexterity).

When using weapons of this nature, simply substitute Gun Combat with the appropriate skill.

Common Modifiers to Ranged Attacks Dice Modifiers (DM) are commonly used to influence Gun Combat (or Heavy Weapons or Athletics) checks when attacking as shown on the Common Modifiers table.

LEADERSHIP The Traveller can pass orders, commands and suggestions to comrades fighting on the same side. To do this, the Traveller makes a Leadership check (INT, EDU or SOC). The Effect of this check is the number of bonuses (each equal to DM+1) the Traveller can give to any skill checks, including attack rolls, to other Travellers on the same side. The Traveller must be able to freely communicate to another Traveller in order to grant a bonus and no Traveller can benefit from more than one DM+1 bonus for any single check.

However, bad leadership can end a battle quicker than good leadership can win one. If the Effect of the Leadership check is negative, the opposing side may inflict a number of penalties equal to the Effect to combatants on the Traveller's side. Each penalty is equal to DM-1 and is applied in the same way as the bonuses for good leadership.

MINOR ACTIONS Instead of performing a Significant Action, a Traveller may instead perform two Minor Actions in its place, giving them a total of three Minor Actions in that combat

Common Modifiers Bonuses DM Penalties DM Aiming +1 per action spent Aiming Fast Moving Target -1 for every full 10 meters of target movement relative to the attacker Laser Sight +1 if Aiming Long Range -2 Short Range +1 Extreme Range -4
— — Target in Cover -2
— — Prone Target -1

round (the two from the Significant Action, plus the one Minor Action they receive every round anyway).

**MISCELLANEOUS** A Traveller may make a skill check or do something else as a Significant Action when it requires their full attention, concentration, complicated physical or mental actions, or a combination thereof. These include the following:

•  Applying first aid to a wounded comrade.
•  Trying to bypass a security system to gain access to a bunker.
•  Using a psionic talent.
•  Get into a crew position in a vehicle.
•  Calling in an ortillery strike.

MINOR ACTIONS A Traveller can normally perform a single Minor Action in a combat round, although they may perform up to three if they forego their Significant Action.

**AIMING** A Traveller who spends a Minor Action aiming at a target will receive DM+1 to their next ranged attack on the target, so long as they do nothing else but aim. A Traveller may use consecutive Minor Actions to aim, gaining a maximum of DM+6 to an attack if they are able to spend six consecutive Minor Actions aiming at the same target while doing nothing else.

**CHANGING STANCE** A Traveller may stand, crouch or lie prone as a Minor Action.

**DRAWING/RELOADING** Most weapons require a Minor Action to draw or otherwise make ready for combat and a Minor Action to reload once they have run out of ammunition. If a weapon requires a longer time for either, this will be noted in its description.

**MOVEMENT** The Traveller may move a number of meters up to their Movement score (for humans and most humanoid Travellers, this will be six meters) for each Minor Action. Difficult terrain, such as ruins or mud will halve a Traveller's Movement. Being prone will quarter a Traveller's Movement score.

Some aliens and animals have different Movement scores and this will be noted in their descriptions.

MISCELLANEOUS A Traveller may make a skill check or do something else as a Minor Action if it does not require their full attention, concentration, complicated physical or mental actions. These include the following:

•  Spotting a good sniping position.
•  Identifying equipment used by an enemy.
•  Picking something off the ground or nearby surface.

FREE ACTIONS These are actions that can be accomplished so quickly that they do not even warrant a Minor Action. This includes shouting a warning or pushing a button, for example.

A Traveller may perform as many Free Actions in a combat round as they wish, although the referee is free to impose a limit if they decide the Traveller is attempting to do too much.

EXTENDED ACTIONS Some skill checks take longer than a single combat round to complete. A Traveller may be attempting to download valuable data from a computer as a firefight erupts around them, for example, or they may be desperately trying to fix the engine of an air/raft so they and their friends can escape an ambush.

When performing a skill check that will take longer than a combat round, roll for a suitable timeframe, as shown on page 62. This will indicate how long it will take to complete the skill check. Note that a Traveller can sometimes opt to go faster or slower on such a check as also shown on the same page.

If a Traveller sustains damage while performing an Extended Action, they must make an immediate check with the skill they are currently using, with the amount of damage sustained as a negative DM. If they fail the skill check, this round's work will not count towards the completion of the task. Failure with an Effect of -6 or less will ruin the task completely and the Traveller will have to start again from scratch.

REACTIONS A Traveller who is about to be attacked can react, either dodging a shot or parrying a blow.

This is called a Reaction and a Traveller can perform an unlimited amount of Reactions in every

combat round. However, every time a Traveller performs a Reaction, they will suffer DM-1 on their next set of actions.

DODGING A Traveller who is dodging will inflict a penalty equal to their DEX DM or Athletics (dexterity), whichever is higher, to their attacker's attack roll. Every attack must be dodged separately, so if a Traveller is shot at by two enemies in the same round, they can dodge both but will suffer DM-2 on their next actions.

Both ranged and melee attacks may be dodged.

DIVING FOR COVER This is similar to dodging but instead of just ducking down or away from an attack, a Traveller will be throwing themselves to the ground, hopefully behind something solid. A Traveller may only dive for cover from ranged attacks.

A Traveller diving for cover will inflict a DM-2 on the attack roll of every attacker who targets them in this combat round and may get a bonus to Protection.

They may dive behind any object within 1.5 meters of their current position. If there is no suitable cover nearby, the Traveller only inflicts DM-1 on any attack rolls made against them, for being a prone target.

However, a Traveller diving for cover will forgo their next actions completely – they are too busy trying to avoid being hurt!

PARRYING A Traveller in close combat may attempt to parry an opponent's melee attack as a Reaction. In so doing, they will inflict their Melee skill as a negative DM to the attacker's attack roll.

MELEE ATTACKS When a Traveller is within two meters of an enemy, they are said to be locked in close combat. At this very short range, certain rules apply.

•  Melee attacks may be made (see below).
•  Neither the Traveller nor their enemy may attack any other target other than those they are in close combat with.
•  Only single-handed ranged weapons, such as pistols, may make ranged attacks against a target in close combat. Note that a pistol can be parried in close combat, representing the weapon getting knocked aside.
•  Larger weapons, such as rifles, may only be used as clubs (see page 125).
•  If one combatant moves while locked in close combat, their enemy may make an immediate (and
'free') attack with DM+2 to the attack roll.

WEAPONS A variety of weapons are available to Travellers, from humble knives and clubs, to high-powered laser rifles and plasma guns. All these weapons share some common characteristics.

Two weapons are shown below as examples, a dagger and a rifle.

TL: This is the Tech Level that the weapon first appears. Generally speaking, it would be highly unusual to buy a weapon on a world that has a lower Tech Level.

Range: This is the effective range of a weapon, the range at which an average user might have a chance of getting a shot on target.

Short Range: If a target lies within one quarter of a weapon's Range score, the attacker will gain DM+1 to all attack rolls made with it as they will be within the weapon's Short Range.

Long Range: If a target is beyond the weapon's Range but less than twice the Range away, it is at Long Range. The attacker will suffer DM-2 when making an attack roll.

Extreme Range: If a target is beyond the weapon's Long Range but less than four times the Range away, it is at Extreme Range. The attacker will suffer DM-4 when making an attack roll.

Weapon TL Range Damage Kg Cost Magazine Magazine Cost Traits Dagger 1 Melee 1D+2 0.2 Cr10 — — — Rifle 5 500 m 3D 3 Cr200 20 10 —

Note that unless a weapon has the Scope trait (see page 79), all attacks made at a range greater than 100 meters are automatically considered to be Extreme Range. This assumes the Traveller is in a combat situation – if the Traveller is in a no-stress environment, the referee is free to increase this to 300 meters.

Damage: This is the base amount of damage dealt by the weapon when it successfully hits a target. Damage is covered in more detail below.

**Kg:** A simple measure of the mass of the weapon. This will affect how much a Traveller can carry.

Cost: The cost of buying the weapon, in Credits.

Magazine: Most ranged weapons are capable of holding more than one round or projectile before they need reloading. How many shots can be fired before reloading is necessary is noted here.

Magazine Cost: This is simply the cost of a spare magazine that will fully reload the weapon.

Traits: Some weapons have special rules. These will be listed here and are covered in more detail on page 79.

DAMAGE Each weapon in Traveller lists the damage it inflicts as a number of dice. A rifle, for example, has a Damage score of 3D:

- Upon a successful attack, damage is rolled for, with
    the Effect of the attack roll added to the total.
- Damage is initially applied to a target's END. If
    a target is reduced to 0 END, then any excess
    damage is deducted from either the target's STR or
    DEX (target's choice of which).
- If either STR or DEX are reduced to 0, the Traveller
    becomes unconscious and any further damage is
    deducted from the remaining physical characteristic.
- If all three physical characteristics (STR, DEX
    and END) are reduced to 0, the Traveller has
    been killed.

When characteristics have been eroded by damage, their DMs should be recalculated and the impaired DM used until the damage is healed.

Healing damage is covered on page 82.

MELEE ATTACKS When a melee attack is successful, the attacker adds their STR DM to the damage rolled for the weapon, in addition to the Effect of the attack roll. Bigger things hit harder!

ARMOR Armor reduces the damage sustained in an attack by the value of its Protection score. An attack with Effect 6+ always inflicts at least one point of damage, regardless of the actual damage rolled or the Protection score.

Some weapons have the AP, or Armor Piercing, trait. These weapons ignore an amount of Armor equal to their AP score.

COVER When the bullets start flying, Travellers are advised to take cover behind something solid, ducking back when shot at and popping up to return fire.

A Traveller using cover to shield themselves while engaging in combat inflicts DM-2 against all ranged attacks made against them.

HIDING If a Traveller is able to position themselves completely in cover so the enemy cannot see them, and chooses not to make any attacks, they can hide.

However, if an enemy is aware of the Traveller's presence, they can still be attacked. The Traveller gains all the benefits of cover but also gains a bonus to their armor's Protection (or giving the Traveller Protection if they did not already have one). The amount of bonus Protection a target receives depends on the type of cover it is hiding behind.

If a Traveller could potentially claim cover from two different types of cover (for example, they have ducked down behind a ground car within a forest and also has trees between themselves and their attacker) then they only receive a Protection bonus from the most effective cover.

The following table gives some examples of Protection bonuses granted by cover. The referee is free to devise their own based on the values of this table:

Cover Bonus Protection Vegetation +2 Tree Trunk +6 Stone Wall +8 Civilian Vehicle +10 Armored Vehicle +15 Fortifications +20

DESTRUCTIVE WEAPONS Some weapons are so powerful, they are capable of blasting apart small vehicles with a single shot. Such weapons are referred to as being Destructive.

A Destructive weapon is noted in its Damage score with two Ds (for example, if a weapon was listed as having Damage 3DD, it would be Destructive, rolling three dice for damage).

A Destructive weapon multiplies the total rolled for Damage by 10.

GRAPPLING In close combat, a Traveller may try to wrestle or restrain their enemy, rather than simply hitting them.

To grapple an enemy, the Traveller makes an opposed Melee (unarmed) check with their target, each using either STR or DEX DM. The winner of this check may choose to do one of the following:

•  Force an opponent prone on the ground.
•  Disarm an opponent. If the Effect is 6+, they may take their opponent's weapon.
•  Throw an opponent 1D meters, causing 1D damage. This automatically ends the grapple.
•  Inflict damage equal to 2 + the Effect of the Melee check. This damage ignores any armor.
•  Inflict damage using a pistol or small blade- sized weapon.
•  Escape and move away (as a normal movement action), ending the grapple.
•  Drag their opponent up to three meters.
•  Continue the grapple with no other effect.

While involved in a grapple, the Traveller may not perform any Significant or Minor Action except to make opposed Melee (unarmed) checks.

DUAL WEAPONS Under some circumstances, a referee may allow a Traveller to use two weapons at the same time. These have to be weapons that can be reasonably be used in a single hand each, such as two blades, two pistols or a blade and pistol.

If a Traveller is using two weapons at the same time, they may attack with both in the same combat round. However, they may not aim with either and will suffer DM-2 to the attack rolls of both. This penalty will not apply if the Traveller is carrying two weapons but only attacks with one.

WEAPON TRAITS Some weapons have additional special rules that will greatly affect their use. These special rules are listed under the Traits section of a weapon's description and are detailed here.

**AP X:** This weapon has the ability to punch through armor through the use of specially shaped ammunition or high technology. It will ignore an amount of Protection equal to the AP score listed. Spacecraft scale targets (see page 167) ignore the AP trait unless the weapon making the attack is also Spacecraft scale.

**Auto X:** These weapons fire multiple rounds with every pull of the trigger, filling the air with a hail of fire. A weapon with the Auto trait can make attacks in three fire modes: single, burst and full auto. Attacks using the Auto trait lose any benefits gained from aiming.

•  Single: Attacks are made using the normal combat rules.
•  Burst: Add the Auto score to damage. This uses a number of rounds equal to the Auto score.
•  **Full Auto:** Make a number of attacks equal to the Auto score. These attacks can be made against separate targets so long as they are all within six meters of one another. Full auto uses a number of rounds equal to three times the Auto score.

A weapon cannot use the Auto trait in the same action as the Scope trait or an aiming action.

**Blast X:** This weapon has an explosive component or is otherwise able to affect targets spread across a wide area. Upon a successful attack, damage is rolled against every target within the weapon's Blast score in meters. Dodge Reactions may not be made against a Blast weapon but targets may dive for cover. Cover may be taken advantage of if it lies between a target and the center of the weapon's Blast.

Bulky: A Bulky weapon has a powerful recoil or is simply extremely heavy – this makes it difficult to use effectively in combat by someone of a weak physical stature. A Traveller using a Bulky weapon must have STR 9 or higher to use it without penalty. Otherwise, all attack rolls will have a negative DM equal to the difference between their STR DM and +1.

Radiation: When a Radiation weapon is fired, the target will receive 2D x 20 rads (see page 81), multiplied by three for Spacecraft scale weapons (so, they deal 2D x 60 rads). If the Radiation weapon is Destructive, every target within 10 meters will also receive 2D x 20 rads.

Scope: The weapon has been fitted with vision- enhancing sights, allowing it to put shots on target from far greater ranges. A weapon with the Scope trait ignores the rule that limits all attacks made at a range greater than 100 meters are automatically treated as being at Extreme range, so long as the Traveller aims before shooting.

Smart: This weapon has intelligent or semi-intelligent rounds able to guide themselves to a target. They gain a DM to their attack rolls equal to the difference between their TL and that of the target (usually their armor or vehicle, although Smart weapons can also home in on communications devices, computers and weapons). This DM will be a minimum of DM+1 and a maximum of DM+6.

Stun: These weapons are designed to deal non-lethal damage, incapacitating a living target rather than killing it. Damage is only deducted from END, taking into account any Protection. If the target's END is reduced to 0, the target will be incapacitated and unable to perform any actions for a number of rounds by which the damage exceeded their END. Damage received from Stun weapons is completely healed by one hour of rest.

Very Bulky: Some weapons are designed only for the strongest combatants. A Traveller using a Very Bulky weapon must have STR 12 or higher to use it without penalty. Otherwise, all attack rolls will have a negative DM equal to the difference between their STR DM and +2.

Zero-G: This weapon has little or no recoil, allowing it to be used in low or zero gravity situations without requiring an Athletics (dexterity) check.

# ENCOUNTERS AND DANGERS

When adventuring through the universe, a Traveller has a great deal more to be worried about than finding themselves in the middle of a battle. This chapter covers the dangers and hazards that can be found among the stars and how Travellers can avoid them.

ENVIRONMENTAL DANGERS Most life-bearing worlds feature biology completely incompatible with alien visitors, so Travellers are utterly unaffected by their native pathogens. The exceptions are typically planets where everything is inimical to human life. Alien diseases that affect humans are comparatively rare, most of which are mutations or engineered variants of diseases originally from Earth. Panacea drugs can help the immune system resist infection on unfamiliar worlds. Poisons are rarer but more dangerous – injecting an unfamiliar chemical into your bloodstream is never a good idea.

DISEASES Diseases reduce a Traveller's characteristics, starting with END. The Traveller must make a series of END checks to resist the effects of the disease. If the Traveller fails an END check, they take the listed damage and must make another END check a few hours or days later, depending on the Interval of the disease. Once an END check has been passed, the Traveller has fought off the disease. At the referee's discretion, some more tenacious diseases may require multiple successful checks to shake off.

Disease END check Difficulty Damage Interval Anthrax Very Difficult (12+) 2D 1D days Biological Weapon

Formidable (14+) 3D 1D hours

Pneumonia Average (8+) 1D 1D weeks Regina Flu Routine (6+) 1D-2 1D days

FALLING A Traveller who falls on a 1-gravity world suffers 1D damage for every two meters they fall. High- or low- gravity worlds (see Gravity) will increase or decrease the damage by 1D for every four meters fallen. A Traveller who make a successful Athletics check

can reduce the distance fallen for the purposes of calculating damage by a number of meters equal to the Effect of their check.

Armor does not protect against damage sustained from falling.

FATIGUE A Traveller can become fatigued in several ways:

•  After staying awake for a number of hours greater than their END + 18.
•  After performing heavy labour for a number of hours greater than their END.
•  After making a number of consecutive melee attacks greater than their END in a single combat.

A fatigued Traveller suffers DM-2 to all checks until they rest. At the referee's discretion, continuing exhausting work while already fatigued can result in the Traveller falling unconscious. Various drugs and treatments can relieve fatigue.

POISONS Poisons operate in the same way as diseases but generally work much faster and often have a wider range of effects.

Disease

END check Difficulty Damage Interval Arsenic Difficult (10+) 2D 1D minutes Tranq Gas Difficult (10+) Unconscious 1D seconds Neurotoxin Very Difficult
(12+)

1D INT 1D seconds

GRAVITY Grav plates are common on spacecraft and space stations and so Travellers may spend most of their lives in comfortable Earth-like gravity (1G). However, grav plates can malfunction and once a Traveller steps off their ship onto the surface of a world, they become subject to the often brutal effects of gravity.

High Gravity: Environments that have a gravity of 1.4 G or more (typically worlds of Size 10) are classed as being High Gravity. Humans find high-gravity worlds unpleasant. Especially high-gravity worlds require

the use of pressured or powered suits to support the human frame. Travellers on high-gravity worlds suffer DM-1 to all skill checks until they acclimatise, a process that takes 1D weeks. Travellers with the Athletics
(strength) skill acclimatise within 1D days.

**Low Gravity:** Environments that have a gravity of 0.7 G or less (typically worlds of Size 6 or smaller) are classed as being Low Gravity. Humans tend to find life on low-gravity worlds to be initially pleasant but regular exercise regimes and medicinal supplements are required to prevent bone and muscle degradation. Those who spent too long on low-gravity worlds cannot tolerate higher gravities. Travellers on low-gravity worlds suffer DM-1 to all physical skill checks until they acclimatise, a process which takes 1D weeks. Travellers with the Athletics (dexterity) skill acclimatise within 1D days.

**Zero Gravity:** A Traveller in a zero gravity situation suffers all the effects of Low Gravity (the world Size is assumed to be 0). In addition, they must be careful to watch for things that can affect their momentum – most notably, firing weapons that have recoil.

Every time the Traveller uses a close combat weapon or any ranged weapon that does not have the Zero-G trait, they must make an Average (8+) Athletics
(dexterity) check or not only automatically miss their target but start to spin helplessly out of control.

A Traveller spinning out of control in zero gravity may regain control with an Average (8+) Athletics
(dexterity) check.

**RADIATION** Radiation is a constant danger throughout space. Spacecraft hull materials shield against most radiation; coupled with the added protection offered by hydrogen fuel tanks lining the inner hull means that exposure suffered by most spacers is only a few times that of being planetside. Travellers in vessels flying too close

to a star or with breached hulls or damaged reactors do risk exposure and the presence of harmful radiation on worlds or in combat means Travellers must be wary when they step off their ships.

Radiation exposure is measured in rads. Once a Traveller has absorbed a certain number of rads, they will suffer the effects of radiation. One problem with radiation exposure is that while physical symptoms can be treated and may heal, the cumulative effects of the radiation itself never go away. The Traveller's rads must be kept track of and further exposure adds to what the Traveller is already suffering until a deadly level is reached. Accumulated rads can only be removed by using anti-rad drugs.

Radiation effects are suffered each time a Traveller is exposed to radiation, and as a result of cumulative rads over time. Thus a Traveller who has absorbed 75 rads in the past and subsequently recovered from the effects, who then absorbs another 20 rads from a solar flare, now has a total of 95 rads, whether they suffer any serious effects this time or not. They are fast approaching a moderate dose, as shown on the Radiation Effects table.

Travellers exposed to a weapon with the Radiation trait will receive a one-time dose of radiation. Entering a radioactive area or being exposed to a leak or solar flare will cause exposure every few minutes or hours.

Radiation Exposure Radiation Source Rads Received Minor reactor leak 2D/hour Serious reactor leak 2D/20 minutes Minor solar flare 1D x 100/hour Major solar flare 3D x 100/hour Radiation weapon 2D x 20 immediately

Vacc suits and other measures of protection reduce radiation exposure, as shown on page 102. The hull of a spacecraft decreases the radiation exposure of those inside by 500.

**Radiation Effects**

Immediate Radiation Exposure Immediate Effects

Cumulative Radiation Exposure Cumulative Effects 50 rads or less None 50 rads or less None 51–150 rads 1D damage, Nausea (-1 to all checks until medical treatment received) 51–150 rads None

151–300 rads 2D damage 151–300 rads -1 END permanently 301–500 rads 4D damage, hair loss 301–500 rads -2 END permanently 501–800 rads 6D damage, sterile 501–800 rads -3 END permanently 801 rads or more 8D damage, internal bleeding 801 rads or more -4 END permanently

Solar flares are therefore still dangerous even to a starship, so when a serious flare is detected vessels usually try to take cover behind asteroids, moons and so forth, or at least have their crew don vacc suits to increase their protection. Orbital stations in systems with a lot of flare activity have layers of radiation- absorbent materials and personnel sanctuaries with even more protection and can ride out even the worst flares. This level of protection is too bulky for all but the most specialized starships.

SUFFOCATION A spacecraft or self-contained, sealed structure with power can usually sustain life support for one person per stateroom for one month comfortably, and for six months at a stretch (number of staterooms x 5,000 person/hours). Without power, this drops to two weeks at most. Various shelters will list the amount of air and life support available if they differ.

Without life support, a Traveller begins to suffocate, suffering 1D damage each minute. A Traveller who is utterly without air (such as one being smothered or strangled or who has been thrown out of an airlock) suffers 1D damage each round instead.

TEMPERATURE Unusually hot or cold worlds can cause damage
(starting with END) unless the Travellers are suitably protected. Temperatures are in Celsius.

VACUUM If a Traveller finds themselves outside of a spacecraft without a vacc suit, in the cold vacuum, they are in very big trouble.

Any air in the lungs will be expelled violently, blood will boil and skin will bloat and stretch. In short, the Traveller will have seconds at best to get back to safety.

Any Traveller exposed to vacuum will suffer a cumulative 1D damage every round. Thus, the Traveller will suffer 1D damage in the first round, 2D damage in the second round, 3D damage in the third and so on.

WEATHER High winds and torrential rain inflict DM-1 to all skill checks made in the teeth of the weather, depending on the intensity of conditions. Unusual weather effects include flammable methane clouds, rain of sulphuric acid, mists of poisonous gas, flash floods, and carbon dioxide glaciers subliming to gas in the heat of the Traveller's footsteps...

HEALING With all the dangers present throughout the galaxy, it is inevitable that Travellers will get hurt. Fortunately, there are several options to heal and repair oneself.

There are two forms of healing – medical treatment and natural healing. Note that failed Medic checks can easily end up causing the patient more damage – we recommend you see trained doctors only!

MEDICAL TREATMENT First Aid: Applying first aid restores a number of characteristic points equal to the Effect of a Medic check (EDU), for a minimum of one point. Points restored by first aid are divided as desired among all damaged physical characteristics. First aid requires at least basic medical equipment (such as a medikit), must be initiated within one minute of the injury and can only be successfully applied once.

Surgery: A Traveller who still has three damaged characteristics after first aid has been applied requires surgery. Surgery restores characteristic points just like first aid but if the check is failed the patient loses more characteristic points equal to 3+ the Effect of the Medic check (EDU). Surgery requires a hospital or sickbay. Once one characteristic is back to its maximum level the patient can benefit from medical care.

Temperature Table Heat Effect Cold Effect 50º (very hot desert) 1D/hour -25º (Arctic) 1D/hour 200º (~Mercury) 1D/round -50º (~Mars) 2D/hour 500º (~Venus) 2D/round -200º (~Pluto) 1D/round Burning Torch 1D/round Industrial Freezer 1D/round Welding Torch 2D/round Liquid Nitrogen 2D/round Inferno 3D/round — —

Medical Care: A Traveller who has only one or two damaged characteristics after first aid has been applied, or who has had one of their three physical characteristics restored to normal through surgery, can benefit from medical care. Medical care restores 3+ the Traveller's END DM + the doctor's Medic skill in characteristic points per day, divided evenly among all damaged characteristics. Medical care requires a hospital or sickbay and for the Traveller to undergo full bed rest.

In high technology hospitals, standard procedure in most cases is to use the Slow Drug (see page 115) to hasten healing.

For example, Morn is mauled by an alien predator while exploring a strange moon. He is able to drive _the predator off with his pistol, wounding it. Morn has suffered damage to all three of his characteristics – he_ has lost 10 END, 5 DEX and 3 STR. Kathya applies _first aid, bringing Morn's STR back up to its maximum_ level. With only two characteristics now wounded, _Morn qualifies for medical care and, once in their ship's_ sickbay, is quickly restored to health.

**Augmentation and Medical Care:** Cybernetic or genetic augments can interfere with medical treatment. All medical care or surgery Medic checks treating a Traveller suffer a negative DM equal to the difference in Tech Level between the medical facility and the highest relevant implant. For example, a Traveller with TL13 Enhanced Vision being treated in a TL10 hospital would inflict DM-3 to the surgeon's Medic checks.

Mental Characteristics: Other than PSI, characters may also suffer damage to their INT or EDU (the latter reflecting loss of memory). Unless otherwise specified, each mental characteristic heals at a rate of one point each per day.

**NATURAL HEALING** An injured Traveller regains a number of characteristic points equal to 1D + END DM per day of full rest.

A Traveller who requires surgery only regains characteristic points equal to their END DM per day of rest, which means that the Traveller may never heal naturally and will even get worse if their END DM is currently negative (and it probably will be...).

UNCONSCIOUSNESS An unconscious Traveller may make an END check after every minute. If successful, they regain consciousness. If they fail, they must wait another minute before trying again, this time with a cumulative DM+1 for every previous check failed.

ENCOUNTERS Throughout their adventures, Travellers will have the opportunity to meet many strange animals, aliens, robots and other potential hostiles. When the referee determines an encounter has occurred, it will be important for them to know exactly where any potential hostiles are and when Travellers will become aware of them.

During encounters, a range band system is used for convenience, as shown on the Range Band table.

Range Band Range Distance to Target Close Up to 5 meters Short 5–10 meters Medium 11–50 meters Long 51–250 meters Very Long 251–500 meters Distant 501–5,000 meters Very Distant Over 5 kilometers

When an encounter occurs, the referee should roll on the Encounter Distance table to determine when the Travellers might first become aware of the potential danger. There are a variety of modifiers given here to reflect specific situations but the referee should feel free to further modify the results based on circumstances. For example, if the Travellers are being tracked by hit men in a crowded city street, they are unlikely to spot them at Distant range (over 500 meters). However, this could be entirely possible if the hit men are not on foot but flying above the street in an air/raft...

Encounter Distance 2D Range Band 2 or less Close 3 Short 4–5 Medium 6–9 Long 10–11 Very Long 12 or more Distant

Apply the following modifiers:

Clear Terrain DM+3 Forest or Woods DM-2 Crowded Area DM-2 In Space DM+4 Target is a Vehicle DM+2 for every 10 tons of Shipping or part of Travellers actively looking for danger

- highest Recon skill

Under normal circumstances, Travellers will automatically spot the target as an item of interest (at least) and be able to start taking appropriate action. However, if the target is attempting to remain hidden, perhaps get closer before launching an attack or simply to remain in place to observe passers-by, the Travellers will need to spot the target before they can take any action against it.

This is normally accomplished by a simple Recon check opposed by the target's Stealth. Use of basic optical devices by the Travellers or camouflage by the target can impose modifiers of DM+1 to +3 at the referee's discretion.

However, in the technological universes of Traveller, there is always the option to use sophisticated electronic sensors, some of which are detailed in the Equipment chapter.

When using any kind of sensor, the Electronics
(sensors) skill is used, opposed by the target's Stealth. More advanced uses of sensors and stealth are detailed in the Vehicle Handbook.

ANIMALS Many worlds in the galaxy are capable of bearing life and across the galaxy evolution (or genetic engineering) has produced bizarre creatures, forming complex ecosystems very different from those of the worlds the Travellers are used to.

Animals are defined by a handful of characteristics as shown in the example here, a larker – a massive but gentle insect found on the open grassy plains where it grazes on long foliage.

Hits: How much damage the animal can sustain before it is killed. All damage is applied to Hits, rather than STR, DEX and END as for Travellers. When an animal's Hits are reduced to zero, it is dead.

Speed: How far the animal can move in a single combat round with a Minor Action.

Skills: Any skills the animal is able to perform are listed here, together with their DM. Unless otherwise stated, all animals have Athletics 0 and Survival 0.

Attacks: Any attacks the animal is capable of are listed here, together with the damage they deal.

Traits: These are special rules the animal has that determine its abilities beyond Hits, Skills and Attacks. Some animals are Amphibious, for example, while others are Very Large.

Behaviour: Animals tend to act in very specific ways according to their place within an ecosystem and will aid a referee in determining its actions. An animal's behavioural characteristics are detailed further on page 89.

TRAITS The following traits may be applied to animals of the referee's creation:

Alarm: When panicked or under threat, this animal emits a powerful screech, odour or makes a bright visual display, alerting others of its kind to danger. At the referee's option, this will either cause all animals of the same type in the immediate area to flee or will bring an additional 2D of them into combat.

Amphibious: The animal is equally at home on land or in the water. It will not suffocate while submerged and its movement is not affected underwater.

Armor (+X): The animal has dense layers of fat, horny plates or some other form of physical protection. It has a Protection score equal to the figure shown in the Armor trait.

**Bioelectricity (+X):** The animal naturally generates a powerful electric current that is discharged when it makes an attack. With each successful attack, the animal will cause an additional amount of damage with the Stun trait, as listed in its Bioelectricity trait.

**Camouflaged:** The animal has physical adaptations that allow it to blend into its environment, such as chameleonic skin or psionic shielding. It gains DM+2 to all Stealth checks.

**Diseased (Difficulty/Damage/Interval):** The animal is a carrier of disease and will infect any creature it comes into physical contact with. At the referee's option, merely being in the animal's lair may cause exposure. The difficulty, damage and interval of the disease is noted within the Diseased trait.

Echolocation: This animal has organs adapted to emit high-frequency sounds, which it uses to pinpoint objects and 'observe' its surroundings with high precision. It can operate in complete darkness, although two-dimensional details (such as writing on a page) cannot be made out. Echolocation can operate in noisy environments but can be completely blocked by sounds operating at similar high frequencies.

**Fast Metabolism (+X):** The animal has a heightened metabolism and very fast reactions. It gains a DM to Initiative rolls equal to the figure shown in the Fast Metabolism trait.

**Flyer (X):** The animal has wings, air sacs or some other method of gaining altitude and soaring. When flying, it may travel at a maximum Speed Band listed in the Flyer trait.

**Heightened Senses:** The animal has better hearing and sense of smell than humans. It receives DM+1 to any Recon and Survival checks it has to make.

**IR/UV Vision:** The animal views the world at a greatly extended electromagnetic range, encompassing at least infrared or ultraviolet wavelengths and perhaps more. This allows it to see clearly in darkness and, at the referee's option, it may notice certain electromagnetic emissions from the equipment of Travellers.

**Large (+X):** The animal is extremely large and presents a huge target. All ranged attacks made against the animal gain a DM equal to the score listed in the Large trait.

ANIMAL HITS The Hits characteristic provides a quick and easy method for a referee to keep track of whether an animal is alive or dead. For most encounters, this will be sufficient but situations may arise when the players need to have a little more detail, such as when they are hunting.

Driven Off: At the referee's option, an animal may be driven off and forced to retreat if it is reduced to half of its Hits or less.

Unconscious: If an animal is reduced to a tenth of its starting Hits or less, it will be rendered unconscious (and seriously injured!).

Destroyed: If an animal suffers enough damage to reduce its Hits to a negative equal to or less than its starting Hits, its body is completely destroyed and will have little or no value for harvesting hides, meat or other materials.

Poison (Difficulty/Damage/Interval): The animal's attacks are poisoned, making them much deadlier. The difficulty, damage and interval of the poison is noted within the Poison trait.

Psionic (X): The animal has a PSI characteristic equal to the score listed in the Psionic trait. The referee should determine which talents it has access to as shown in the Psionics chapter.

Slow Metabolism (-X): The animal has a lethargic metabolism and very slow reactions. It suffers a DM to Initiative rolls equal to the figure shown in the Slow Metabolism trait.

Small (-X): The animal is very small and presents a difficult target. All ranged attacks made against the animal suffer a DM equal to the score listed in the Small trait.

ANIMALS OF ALIEN WORLDS

Carthus A tall, pale creature that dwells in deep desert caves. Its four limbs and spine are extremely flexible as it can dislocate joints at will and feel its way through cracks and crevasses in their dark surroundings looking for prey. A huge mouth scrapes the roof of caves sucking moisture from fungus and moss. Although poor sighted the carthus other senses are highly tuned to search out prey.

Erakruul This is an extremely large sea worm with bioluminescent spots and markings across the length of its body. Its most notable feature is a large sucker-like disk of a mouth filled with hundreds of tiny sharp teeth. The erakruul spends the majority of its life in the very deep, inky black oceans of its homeworld where it feeds on corpses that sink to the bottom of the sea. While it is unknown how large these creatures can grow, the largest sighting to date was over 60 meters in length.

**Gazaal** In the wild, the Gazaal is a dangerous animal due to its size and tendency to charge and trample when threatened. The natives of its world have long learned to domesticate it for their own needs, be it as beast of burden or personal mount. Indeed, while it is not a fast runner, the Gazaal is capable of travelling long distances.

Klian Sea Sifter Living in temperate shallows, the sea sifter is a small aquatic mammal that spends its time searching the seabed for tiny invertebrates. Instead of fur, its skin is covered in small articulated plates that protect it against most predators attacking from above while it feeds.

Animal Hits Speed Klian Sea Sifter 6 2m Skills Recon 1, Stealth 0, Survival 1 Attacks Claws (D3) Traits Amphibious, Armor (+4), Camouflage, Small (-2) Behaviour Carnivore, Grazer

Nibbon A small cute creature commonly found in pine forests inside the trunks of trees, they make popular pets and companions due to their friendly and loyal demeanour. Nibbons resemble small green fennec foxes with antennae similar to moths, as well as surprisingly strong and colourful wings to warn off predators. They used to be a delicacy on their homeworld but can only be cooked by extremely talented chefs who know where their deadly poison glands are located. Their favorite foods are small insects and fruit.

Ruuta The ruuta is a small ball covered in mottled down. There are no apparent eyes or other features apart from webbed spines protruding from each side of its sphere, like wings, which flap at incredible speed and make a deep buzzing noise. It spends the majority of its life in the upper clouds of its homeworld feeding on chemicals by absorption through its wing membranes and only returns to the surface to lay eggs. The males of this species are approximately four centimeters in diameter and tend to be vibrantly coloured in order to attract mates while the females are around eight centimeters in diameter and tend to be mostly black, white and varying shades of grey.

BEHAVIOUR Regardless of their world of origin or biochemistry, the majority of creatures fall into the following categories; Herbivores, Omnivores, Carnivores and Scavengers. These categories are further broken down into other categories, such as Grazers or Filters. A Carnivore that hunts by ambushing its prey will be a very different encounter to one that is part of a pack.

Terran creatures that exemplify these behaviours are noted in brackets after the descriptions below. Suggested traits and skills are noted after the description – the exact level of skills varies depending on the particular creature as defined by the referee.

•  Carrion-Eater (vulture): Scavengers that wait for all other threats to disperse before beginning. Carrion-eaters have Recon.
•  Chaser (wolf): Animals that kill their prey by attacking and exhausting it after a chase. Chasers have Athletics (dexterity and/or endurance).
•  Eater (army ant): Eaters will eat anything they encounter, including Travellers.
•  Filter (earthworm): Herbivores that pass their environment through their bodies are termed filters. Unlike grazers, which move to food, filters move a flow of matter through themselves and filter out the food.
•  Gatherer (raccoon, chimpanzee): Gatherers are herbivores that collect and store food. Gatherers have Stealth.
•  Grazer (antelope): Grazers move from food source to food source, often in large packs. Their primary form of defence tends to be fleeing danger.
•  Hunter (baboon): Opportunistic predators that stalk easy prey. Hunters have Survival.
•  Hijacker (lion): Scavengers that steal the kills of others through brute force or weight of numbers are hijackers.
•  Intimidator (coyote): Scavengers that establish their claim to food by frightening or intimidating other creatures. Intimidators have Persuade.
•  Killer (shark): Carnivores that possess a raw killing instinct, attacking in a frenzied manner. Killers have Melee.
•  Intermittent (elephant): Herbivores that do not devote their entire time to searching for food.
•  Pouncer (cat): Pouncers kill by stalking and ambushing their prey. Pouncers have Stealth, Recon and Athletics (dexterity or strength).
•  Reducer (vermin): Reducers are scavengers that act constantly on all available food, devouring even the remains left by other scavengers.

**HOW BIG A BEAST?** When creating a new animal for an encounter, a referee simply has to decide on a concept for the creature, assign an appropriate amount of Hits and attacks, and then record any desired skills, Traits and Behaviour.

**Animal Size**

Hits Trait Damage Animal 1–2 Small (-4) 1 Mouse or Rat 3–5 Small (-3) D3 Cat or Raccoon 6–7 Small (-2) D3 Badger or Dog 8–13 Small (-1) 1D Chimpanzee or Goat 14–28 — 1D Human 29–35 Large (+1) 2D Cow or Horse 36–49 Large (+2) 3D Shark 50–70 Large (+3) 4D Rhino 71–90 Large (+4) 5D Elephant 91–125 Large (+5) 6D Carnosaur 125 or more

Large (+6) 7D Sauropod or Whale

The number of Hits and attacks an animal can have may vary greatly although it will be based loosely on size. A referee need not be bound by the suggestions here and can vary Hits as they see fit. After all, an ostrich is taller than a human but is relatively lightweight and so would have less Hits. A gorilla is of a similar size to a human but is far bulkier and so would have more Hits. However, the Animal Size table gives some examples of various animals and suitable Hits and Large/Small traits that the referee can base their own creations upon.

Remember, these are just guidelines. A giant floating gaseous jellyfish may be larger than a dinosaur (Large +6) but have less Hits (perhaps 12 or 14) than an average human...

•  Siren (Venus fly-trap): Sirens create a lure to attract prey. Usually, this lure will be specific to the species the siren preys on but some rare lures are universal. Sirens have Deception.
•  Trapper (spider): An animal that allows its prey to enter a trap. Generally, any creature surprised by a trapper is caught in its trap.

ANIMAL REACTIONS Non-domesticated animals usually react to threats or provocation by either fighting or fleeing. When Travellers disturb an animal or otherwise draw attention to themselves while within its territory, roll 2D and consult the Fight or Flight table. If the result is high enough to indicate hostility, the creature attacks. If the result is low enough to indicate flight, it flees, although may return later. If the result on the table is neither attack nor flee, then the animal continues its natural behaviour until provoked, in which case roll again.

OTHER CHARACTERS During the course of the Travellers' adventures, the referee will play a huge variety of characters – starport staff and guards, traders, Imperial bureaucrats and nobles, dangerous criminals, archaeologists and

scientists, naval officers, alien diplomats, untrustworthy brokers, primitive tribesmen, deranged artificial intelligences, alien hive-minds and whoever else the Travellers encounter. Most of these characters will appear only for a single scene, so there is no need to lavish detail on a trader or guard. Just come up with a personality trait or two and a name, and jot them down. If a character is to appear multiple times in the campaign, then the referee should determine characteristics, skills and a fuller personality. While the focus of the game is always on the Travellers, important characters do not exist solely to serve as allies or antagonists. They have their own agendas and desires and will pursue their own goals. Sometimes, their schemes might just enmesh the Travellers!

For example, Erik has a Contact named Tarel Paragi, an Imperial diplomat. Erik can call on Paragi when dealing with Imperial bureaucracies. What Erik does not know is that Tarel is secretly a Zhodani spy and that every favor that Erik asks of his friend is putting him deeper in debt to a foreign power.

GENERATING CHARACTERS While characters can be generated using the Traveller Creation chapter, it is generally faster just to note down characteristics and a few appropriate skills. A skilled

professional has two or three levels in skills related to their occupation and zero or one levels in a half-dozen other skills.

There are five types of character who are likely to show up throughout a typical campaign; Allies, Contacts, Rivals, Enemies and Patrons.

**Allies:** These people are willing to go out of their way to help the Travellers. An Ally is willing to risk their reputation, status and even life for their friends but will expect equal consideration from the Travellers. Allies are actively looking to further the careers of the Travellers, passing on useful information and rumors. In general, Travellers can call on an Ally's aid once per year without penalty but expecting more will stress the Ally's resources. The Ally will still give help if asked but this may result in the Ally losing position or influence.

Erik's Ally is his old Naval commander, Jan Halos, who mustered out of the Navy around the same time as Erik. Halos is now a wandering free trader with his _own starship. In the past, Halos has flown in to rescue_ Erik's ship from attack and aided Erik in a dangerous smuggling mission. If Erik asked, Halos would risk anything for him.

Contacts: These people are willing to help the Traveller when they can but only in a limited fashion. An Ally would give the Travellers a weapon but a Contact would only tell the Travellers where they could purchase it.

Erik's Contact is Tarel Paragi, a diplomat. Tarel will pass on useful information to Erik, in exchange for other rumors and bits of data. Tarel will advise Erik when dealing with the Imperial bureaucracy but will not endanger himself. Theirs is an alliance of convenience as far as the diplomat is concerned.

**Rivals and Enemies:** These are both adversaries of the Travellers – Enemies are just willing to go further. While adventures can revolve around the efforts of a Rival to discredit or kill the Travellers, the referee should also drop Rivals and Enemies into other plots. For example, if the Travellers are trying to find a starport willing to repair their damaged ship, a Rival might show up in the system and poach passengers.

Enemies, and especially Rivals, should be mobile. If the Travellers are going to spend their time jumping from system-to-system, then their Rivals should have starships of their own so the Travellers encounter

them again and again. Enemies can be stationary but should have a long enough reach to affect the Travellers. Totalitarian governments, evil conspiracies or interstellar corporations all make great Enemies.

Erik's Rival is Manfred Greel, a notorious corsair and thief. Greel has a grudge against Erik and takes great pleasure in tormenting or sabotaging anything Erik does. Greel has come to enjoy their little contests, however, and greatly prefers to humiliate and provoke Erik instead of trying to kill him.

Patrons: These people supply the Travellers with work and adventure, and are covered in greater detail later in this chapter.

COMMUNICATIONS Remember, there is no faster-than-light communication in the Third Imperium. Allies and Contacts can only be contacted when the Travellers are in the same system and there will be a delay in communications traffic of several seconds or even minutes if the Travellers are on different planets within that system.

QUICK CHARACTERS If a referee needs to quickly create a Contact, Ally, Rival or Enemy, or if a Traveller needs inspiration to create one, you can roll on the Allies and Enemies table. If desired, also roll on the Character Quirks table to give the character an added dimension.

In addition to rolling on the tables to create quick characters, the referee may also use experience levels to rapidly give a character suitable characteristics and skills.

Green characters have completely average characteristics (a score of 7 for each one). More experienced characters have modified characteristics, adding +1 to a single characteristic if they are Average, another +1 to any two characteristics if they are Experienced and so on, as shown on the Experience table. The characteristics increased in this way should relate to the occupation of the character (so, a scientist would likely have increased INT and EDU, while a mercenary would likely have increased DEX and END).

Additional skills can be added to further specialize a character. A scientist, for example, will likely have Electronics (computers) and Science, while a navy fighter pilot will have Pilot (small craft). The referee can add skills and equipment as they feel appropriate to the character's role in the adventure.

PATRONS AND MISSIONS Patrons are characters in positions of power, authority, influence or dire need who employ the Travellers and give them missions. Sometimes, the reward from a mission will be purely financial – the Travellers might be hired as bodyguards, mercenaries, couriers, thieves or scouts for a few hundred or a few thousand Credits. Other missions will have less tangible rewards, such as being owed a favor by the patron, acquisition of status or influence, or just the knowledge of having done the right thing.

While the referee should normally design missions in detail, tailoring events to the skills and personalities of the Travellers, random missions can be generated in a hurry by using the tables in this chapter.

RANDOM ENCOUNTERS These random encounter tables for settled planets cover a wide cross-section of society and can be used by referees in emergencies or when the Travellers do something unexpected. Encounters should be adjusted based on the culture and technology of the planet. The referee should roll for a new encounter every six hours on average (more often if the Travellers are moving great distances or attracting attention).

PAYMENT FOR MISSIONS The scale of payment for missions varies depending on how difficult the mission is but also on the Travellers' circumstances. A band of penniless Travellers who make their way from system-to-system in low berths might be happy to be paid Cr5000 each for two weeks' work but the crew of a free trader can make hundreds of thousands of Credits by spending that time shipping cargo. In fact, Travellers with huge ship mortgages to maintain may have to turn down unprofitable missions.

A wise patron, therefore, will always offer the Travellers a little more than they can get by trading.

# EQUIPMENT

The vast number of tools and devices in the universe and the variation in potential costs and values defy classification; it is impossible to note and define them all. The objects in this chapter are presented as indications of common qualities and values. Different worlds use different manufacturing techniques, design styles and even physical principles to achieve the same effect. A pistol on one world might resemble a conventional firearm; on another, the same type of gun might be elaborately decorated and coloured to reflect its importance in that world's martial culture; elsewhere, it might be heavily integrated with computers to aid targeting, use bullets formed from ice mixed with plastic polymers or be constructed from sensor-baffling materials and treated woods to avoid detection by security sensors.

Each item is listed with the Tech Level needed to manufacture it, its mass (in kg) and its cost. If an item's weight or cost is not listed, then its weight or cost is negligible. In this case, you can assume that 10 such items would mass one kg or cost Cr1 respectively.

You should note that items are available for several Tech Levels after they first appear but it is often quite hard to find a low-tech item on a high-tech world (few TL13 spacefaring civilizations are going to produce a lot of crossbows or backpack radios).

CREDITS The Credit (Cr) is the standard unit of currency in Traveller. Larger denominations include the KiloCredit
(KCr1 or Cr1000) and the MegaCredit (MCr1 or Cr1000000). It is assumed that the physical Credit is minted by the dominant empire of the universe and is virtually impossible to falsify.

In other settings, other currencies may be used. In 2300AD, for example, the base currency is the Livre, or Lv. However, that actual value of the Livre or any other currency used in any other universe is assumed to be identical to that of a Credit so you will be able to make direct comparisons (and purchases) between the two. For example, Tech Level 10 Combat Armor costs Cr96000 in Traveller. In 2300AD, it would cost Lv96000.

SPENDING CREDITS Citizens of high-technology (TL8 or higher) planets often use electronic Credits. Transactions are authenticated and managed using computers or personal comms. While electronic Credits work perfectly well in-system, lack of faster than light communications in some universes means it is possible for a Traveller to outrun their Credits – having a million Credits in one's bank account on Sylea is all well and good but if you are 20 parsecs away and the data has not caught up with you, then it is inaccessible. Large banks, corporations and other financial institutions use x-boat networks or similar facilities to synchronise important financial records but private citizens must make arrangements to keep Credits available.

It is possible to notify one's bank and have a line of Credit sent ahead (or at least sent at the same time) if you know your destination but wandering Travellers must sometimes default to using physical cash or trade goods. In addition to physical Credits, precious metals, gemstones, radioactive elements or technological wonders are sometimes used in barter on many worlds.

SELLING EQUIPMENT Travellers are likely to accumulate equipment they cannot use, either taken from defeated enemies or replaced by more advanced items. In these cases, they will want to sell equipment for ready cash.

For a quick and simple measure, a referee can presume a Traveller can sell an undamaged item for half its purchase price. There may be times when the referee will want to impose limits on this, perhaps when a Traveller tries to sell a highly advanced technological device on a world with a low Tech Level that has no means of generating electricity, for example.

STANDARDS OF LIVING A standard meal typically costs Cr5–50 or more per person, depending on quality and service. A burger of unidentifiable meat-like substances eaten standing up in a fast-food joint may cost just Cr2–3; a fine meal at a Traveller's Aid Society hostel could cost Cr20, while a sybaritic feast of a dozen courses and entertainments costs Cr500 or more.

Accommodation for a night in a cheap hotel costs Cr10; a good hotel can be found for Cr50–100. Luxury hotels cost Cr300 or more per night. Traveller's Aid Society hostels is available to members and their guests for Cr20 per night.

A Traveller living on board ship is assumed to have their food and lodging taken care of. A Traveller living on a planet or orbital for a long period must spend money on living costs – the amount depends on the quality of life desired. A Traveller who does not live at the standard listed for their SOC risks being embarrassed and perhaps even losing their standing.

Standard of Living Cost/Month Suitable For Very Poor Cr400 SOC 2 Poor Cr800 SOC 4 Low Cr1000 SOC 5 Average Cr1200 SOC 6 Good Cr1500 SOC 7 High Cr2000 SOC 8 Very High Cr2500 SOC 10 Rich Cr5000 SOC 12 Very Rich Cr12000 SOC 14 Ludicrously Rich Cr20000+ SOC 15

ENCUMBRANCE Under most circumstances, the referee can simply rule that Travellers can carry a 'reasonable' amount of equipment without actually tracking it – armor, a main weapon, a pistol, a few grenades and items in a backpack are all reasonable.

However, Travellers being who they are, there may be times when they attempt to carry an unreasonable load.

The first thing to consider is how they are actually carrying something. Six modern rifles may not weigh all that much but without a suitable pack or bundle they are not easy to carry for long stretches without dropping one. When Travellers start to carry a lot of items, the referee should step in and ask where or how they are being carried.

Most items of equipment have a list Mass and a referee can also use this to limit what is being carried. A Traveller should be able to carry equipment totalling a number of kilograms equal to their combined STR and END without penalty, plus any levels in Athletics (strength and/or endurance).

Travellers can carry up to twice this amount but will suffer DM-2 on all physical actions while they do so. They will also count as performing heavy labour as detailed under Fatigue on page 80.

The mass of armor is distributed around the body when worn properly, thus reducing its effective weight. You can reduce the mass of armor that is being worn by 75% for the purposes of encumbrance.

#### THE CORE COLLECTION

Unless otherwise noted, only one type of armor can be worn at a time but there are exceptions. Resolve damage from the outside in – damage that gets through the outer layer of armor is next applied to the inner layer.

Some armors have a required skill. A Traveller suffers DM-1 to all checks taken in the armor per missing skill level. For example, a Traveller with Vacc Suit skill  0 who is in a suit that requires Vacc Suit 2 would have DM-2 to all their checks. Not having the skill at all inflicts the usual DM-3 unskilled penalty instead.

Radiation is a very present danger to many Travellers, whether in combat or exploration. Some armor provides a measure of defence against radiation, as noted in the Rad column of the armor table. This amount is deducted from the rads a Traveller receives every time they are exposed to radiation.

Reflec Armor

cloth Armor

ablat Armor

Ablat: A cheap alternative to reflec, ablat armor is made from a material that ablates (vaporises) when hit by laser fire. Each laser hit on ablat armor reduces its Protection value against lasers by one but the armor is cheap and easily replaceable.

Battle Dress: The premier personal armor, battle dress is a powered form of combat armor but much tougher. The servomotors vastly increase the user's speed and strength, increasing STR and DEX by +4 while wearing the armor. Damage to the wearer's characteristics is calculated as normal but the bonus values from the armor are used for all other purposes such as melee damage or skill checks. An on-board Computer/2 gives tactical advice and updates, and the suit is commonly outfitted with numerous upgrades. The suit is fully enclosed, with a six-hour air supply and gives substantial protection against NBC (nuclear/ biological/chemical) hazards. All weapons used while wearing battle dress count as having the Scope trait. TL14 : This more advanced battle dress is considerably stronger, granting STR +6 and upgrades the internal systems to Computer/3.

Cloth: A heavy duty body suit tailored from ballistic cloth. The fabric absorbs impact energy and spreads it over the body, which can result in bruising. However, cloth armor is highly useful and versatile. TL10 : This armor is lighter and more flexible, and can be indistinguishable from ordinary clothing under normal circumstances.

Combat Armor: This full-body suit is used by the military and not generally available on the open market, although those with military or criminal contacts can obtain suits. It is issued to troop units and mercenary battalions. Combat armor can function as a vacc suit and provides life support for six hours. All weapons used while wearing combat armor count as having the Scope trait. TL12 : Considerably lighter, substituting carbon-tube weave for the smart plastic of the previous generation. TL14 : Offers vastly improved protection.

Flak Jacket: A less expensive version of ballistic cloth, the bulky flak jacket is an unmistakably military garment.

Hostile Environment Vacc Suit: Hostile environment suits are designed for conditions where a normal vacc suit would be insufficient, such as deep underwater, worlds with toxic atmosphere, extremes of radiation or temperature. HEV suits provide life support for six hours.

Jack: A natural or synthetic leather jacket or body suit covering the torso and upper arms and legs. Jack is better than ordinary clothing or bare skin when defending against blades but is useless against guns.

Mesh: A jacket or body suit lined with a flexible metal or plastic mesh that gives it added protection against bullets.

Reflec: Reflec armor is a flexible plastic suit with layers of reflective material and heat-dispersing gel. It is highly effective against lasers but provides no protection against other attacks. Reflec can be worn with other armor but is hard to obtain, quite expensive and imposes DM-2 on any Stealth checks the wearer attempts.

Vacc Suit: The vacc suit or space suit is the spacer's best friend, providing life support and protection when in space. Early vacc suits are unwieldy and uncomfortable but quickly shrink as technology advances. A vacc suit provides life support for six hours. TL10: An improved version that masses a lot less. TL12: At this Tech Level, 'tailored' vacc suits feel like ordinary clothing with a flexible hood and face mask.

ARMOR OPTIONS Chameleon, IR (TL 12) : This technology can be added to any full-body suit. It selectively bleeds heat to match background infrared levels and effectively renders the wearer invisible to infrared detection (DM-4 to detect with sensors). IR chameleon costs Cr5000.

Chameleon, Vislight (TL13) : A more advanced form of IR chameleon, vislight chameleon layers the surface of the armor with light-bending technology, making the wearer nearly invisible to the naked eye (DM-4 to spot). Vislight chameleon costs Cr50000.

hostile environ m ent vacc suit

Computer Weave (TL10) : Computer weave can be added to any armor that does not already have a computer system and adds a Computer/0 to that armor. Costs Cr500. TL11 : Improved computer weave adds Computer/1. Costs Cr1000. TL13 : Advanced computer weave adds Computer/2. Costs Cr5000.

Extended Life Support (TL10) : This upgrade can be added to any suit that provides life support (vacc suit, HEV suit, combat armor, battle dress). By adding high- pressure oxygen tanks and recycling systems, the suit now provides 18 hours of oxygen. Costs Cr10000.

Eye Protection (TL6) : A lot of armor includes eye protection such as visors or goggles to guard against flying debris but such protection becomes absolutely vital at TL9 to guard against the blinding effects of lasers. Eye protection can be added to any armor but is automatically included in any TL9+ armor. Costs Cr50.

Grav Assist (TL12) : This upgrade can be added to combat armor or battle dress only and adds the functionality of a grav belt (see page 119) to the armor at the cost of Cr110000. TL15 : The TL15 version lasts longer. Costs Cr120000.

Magnetic Grapples (TL8) : Magnetic plates in the boots of the armor allow the user to walk normally on a spacecraft without artificial gravity. Costs Cr100.

Medikit (TL10) : An internal medical scanner and drug injector, the medikit can be installed in combat armor, battle dress or a vacc suit. It automatically applies first aid if the Traveller is reduced to END 0 (treat as having Medic 3). It can also administer Fast Drug on command or if life support systems are failing. Costs Cr5000. TL11 : A military medikit can also inject combat drugs and metabolic accelerators on command. Costs Cr10000.

Self-Sealing (TL11) : Self-sealing systems can be added to any armor (except ablat) when it is being made. The armor can seal breaches and repair minor damage. This cannot reconstruct a severely damaged suit of armor but does ensure that a ripped vacc suit or torn jacket repairs itself. Self-sealing only repairs minor damage - getting shot or stabbed is about the limit of the self-sealing capability to manage. Self-sealing costs Cr2000.

Smart Fabric (TL10) : Smart fabric resists stains and dirt, cleaning itself automatically, sloughing off dirt, dust and mud (this function can be suspended for the purposes of camouflage). Adding smart fabric costs Cr1000.

Thruster Pack (TL9) : A simple thruster pack gives the user the ability to maneuver in zero-gravity over short distances. An Athletics (dexterity) check is required to use it accurately. Thruster packs can only be used in microgravity environments. A thruster pack costs Cr2000. TL12 : The long-range thruster pack gives 0.1g acceleration for up to 48 hours, using standard starship fuel. This costs Cr14000. TL14 : The TL14 version of the long-range pack is much smaller, as it uses grav-thruster plates instead but has the same performance profile as the TL12 version. This costs Cr20000.

While technology is capable of significantly altering and improving the body, obvious cybernetic, genetic or surgical alteration of the human form is frowned upon in many universes.

While humans can be altered to survive on hostile worlds

- denizens of a waterworld might be given gills and finger- webbing, while those living on a world with dangerous native micro-organisms might have their immune and digestive systems altered to compensate – unnecessary augmentation is seen as unpleasant and even perverse in many cultures. There are some worlds where genetic alteration or cybernetics are widespread or even mandatory, just as there are worlds where they are strictly forbidden.

Most of the items in this category can be cybernetic
(mechanical or electronic implants and prostheses) or biological (genetic engineering and surgical alternation) or both (a more common solution) but the general term of
'augment' is used for all of them.

Cybernetic Eye

Augmentations can take characteristics above the normal maximums for a Traveller's species.

Augments can interfere with medical treatment. All long-term care or surgery Medic checks treating an augmented Traveller suffer a negative DM equal to the difference in Tech Level between the medical facility and the highest relevant implant. For example, a Traveller with TL15 Endurance Augmentation implants being treated in a TL10 hospital would inflict DM-5 to the surgeon's Medic skill checks.

Cognitive Augmentation: Replacing slow nerve cells with faster synthetic substrates and implanting optoelectronic boosters can increase the speed at which a Traveller thinks, effectively boosting their intelligence.

Neural Comm: A neural comm has identical capacities to a standard comm but the cost is much higher as is the required TL. A Traveller can access the capabilities of a neural comm by thought alone but it still takes a skill check to use for complicated activities.

Physical Characteristic Augmentation: A Traveller's END, STR or DEX can be increased in various ways, from replacing motor neurons with faster synthetic cells, to reinforcing bones and replacing organs with tougher vat-grown clones. Augmentations must be purchased for each characteristic separately.

Subdermal Armor : Adds a mesh of ballistic fibres to the skin and reinforces the bones, giving the Traveller extra armor. Subdermal armor stacks with other protection.

Skill Augmentation: The Traveller's nervous system is rewired to be more suited to a particular task. A pilot might have their reflexes and sense of balance improved; a broker might be made capable of controlling their pupil responses and smelling pheromones and skin salinity of others. A skill augmentation gives the Traveller DM+1 when using that specific skill. A Traveller can only have one skill augmentation and must initially possess that skill at least at level 0 to benefit from the augmentation.

Wafer Jack: A wafer jack is a computer system implanted into the base of the skull that contains a physical data socket and processor running an interface program. A Traveller with a wafer jack can use Expert programs for tasks relying on INT or EDU only. The main benefit of the jack is that it is much smaller and more discrete than a hand computer and the user can access the Expert program by thought alone. A wafer jack has Computer/2 for Expert programs only and is always running Intelligence Interface.

The Intelligence Interface does not use any Bandwidth, so all available Bandwidth may be used for Expert software. Swapping out software is done with physical media and not possible in the heat of the moment.

INSTALLING AUGMENTS The installation of any augments into a Traveller requires surgery, often very extensive surgery. It is assumed that any reputable augments dealer the Traveller visits will have access to first class hospital services (this will not apply if the Traveller visits a back street or illegal augments dealer!) and so there will be no actual danger in the process. However, it will take time; typically 1D weeks, although this is often reduced through the use of the Slow Drug (see page 115).

Communications technology rapidly merges with computer technology at higher Tech Levels. Above Tech Level 8 in most cultures, it is unthinkable to be out of touch except in the most remote areas, with even short-ranged devices able to connect to a planetary- wide communications grid.

**Bug:** Surveillance devices such as hidden microphones and tiny cameras, bugs are available from TL5 onwards. They rapidly miniaturise and become more intelligent. A TL14 bug can be no bigger than a dust mote. The smaller a bug, though the shorter its range – a bug that transmits data needs a much larger power supply than one that just records until collected.

**Audio:** The bug records anything it hears.
**Visual:** The bug records anything it sees. Data: If attached to a computer system, the bug can search and copy data from the computer. The bug cannot breach computer security on its own but if a user accesses the computer in the bug's presence, the bug can read their data. Bioscan: The bug has a basic biological scanner, allowing it to sample the area for DNA traces, chemical taint and so forth. Computer/1: The bug has an onboard computer system rated Computer/1.

A bug can be active or passive. An active bug transmits data (either constantly, or when triggered). Passive bugs just record until activated.

**Commdot:** A commdot is a tiny microphone/ speaker and transmitter, ranging in size between a few centimeters and a few millimeters across. A commdot is capable of interfacing with another communications device and relaying messages back and forth. Commdots have a range of only a few meters and are usually used as hands-free communicators but can also be used as improvised bugs or throat microphones.

**Mobile Comm:** A mobile comm unit is a portable telecommunications device/computer/camera, ranging in size from a bulky handset to a slim watch or pen-like cylinder – in today's world we call them mobile phones or cell phones. Larger comms have physical controls and screens while smaller units either project data and control displays onto nearby surfaces, have fold-out plastic screens, or connect to cybernetics. Comms have only short-range transmission and reception capabilities but most technologically advanced worlds will have planetwide comm networks allowing the user to send messages and access data anywhere.

**Transceiver:** A transceiver is a stand-alone communications device, what today we would call a two-way radio. Unlike a mobile comm, which relies on the presence of an established communications network, a transceiver can send and receive directly under its own power. Most transceivers are radio or laser-based. Meson communicators are possible but generally not easily portable or available. To reach orbital ranges reliably, a transceiver requires a range of 500 kilometers. Mobile Comm

##### computers & software

Any technological society runs on computers, with access to them as basic as the right to air and water. To those both knowledgeable and skilled, computers open a vast array of possibilities in all areas of life and having the right computer for the right job is usually more important than carrying a gun.

USING COMPUTERS Computers in Traveller are ranked by their Processing score. A Computer/3, for example, has a Processing score of 3. This is its ability to run software.

Note that the storage capacity of computers is not used in Traveller as, beyond TL8, the capacity of even a modest computer is effectively unlimited.

All software has a Bandwidth score, which represents the processing power a computer requires in order to run it. At any one time, a computer can run a number of software packages whose combined Bandwidth does not exceed its Processing score.

For example, a Computer/3 could run Translator/1 and Security/2 simultaneously, but if the Traveller using it then wanted to run Intelligent Interface (which has Bandwidth 1) then they would have to swap it out with one of the existing software packages.

A Traveller can use any high-Bandwidth software at a lower Bandwidth, to a minimum of the lowest Bandwidth shown. For example, a Traveller could run Intrusion/3 on a Computer/1 but it would only function as Intrusion/1.

A computer with Processing 0 can only run one software package of Bandwidth 0 at a time.

Note that Processing does not limit how much software a computer can store and have ready to use, just how many software packages can be active and useable at any one time.

A computer must be of a TL equal to or greater than that of the software in order to be able to run it, regardless of available Bandwidth.

Software packages of more than Bandwidth 1 cannot be copied easily, as they require a non-trivial amount of bandwidth to transfer.

For example, an Agent package might be commanded to hack into an enemy computer system and steal a particular data file. They are effectively specialized combinations of Expert Electronics
(computers) and less capable Intellect software packages. Intellect 1

Intellect is an improved Agent, which can use Expert systems. For example, a robot doctor might be running Intellect/1 and Expert Medic/3, giving it a Medic skill of 2. An Intellect program can simultaneously use a number of skills equal to its Bandwidth.

**SHIP-BASED COMPUTERS** The computers used on spacecraft to calculate jump travel and combat solutions are much more powerful than those typically found planetside and can run much more sophisticated software. These are covered on page 161 and in detail within High Guard.

Computer Terminal: This is a 'dumb' terminal with only limited processing power. It serves as an interface to a more powerful computer such as a ship's computer or planetary network. Terminals range in size depending on their control method – a holographic display terminal can be much smaller than one with a physical keyboard and screen. These terminals are treated as Computer/0.

ITEM TL MASS COST Computer Terminal 7 2 Cr200

Portable Computer: A portable computer is a computer system with considerable processing power, yet able to be easily carried – in today's world, this covers laptops and tablets of all sizes. It is more powerful than a computer terminal and can be used without access to a network.

TL PROCESSING MASS COST TL7 Computer/0 5kg Cr500 TL8 Computer/1 2kg Cr250 TL9 Computer/1 1kg Cr100 TL10 Computer/2 0.5kg Cr500 TL11 Computer/2 0.5kg Cr300 TL12 Computer/3 0.5kg Cr1000 TL13 Computer/4 0.5kg Cr1500 TL14 Computer/5 0.5kg Cr5000

OPTIONS Comms (TL8+): Any computer of TL8 or more can act as a short-ranged comm unit or transceiver if specified at purchase. This does not increase the cost of the computer.

Data Display/Recorder (TL13): This headpiece provides a continuous heads-up display for the user, allowing them to view computer data from any linked system. DD/R headsets are commonly used by starship crews, to access information without changing their primary console displays. DD/Rs can display data from any system, not just computers – they can display vacc suit oxygen reserves, grav belt status, neural activity scanner results and so forth. Costs Cr500.

Data Wafer (TL10): The standard medium of information storage in many universes is the data wafer, a rectangle of hardened plastic about the size of a credit card. The interface for a data wafer is standardised but the internal workings vary. A TL10 data wafer is memory diamond, with information encoded in structures of carbon atoms; more advanced wafers use more exotic means of data storage. Costs Cr5.

SOFTWARE PACKAGE MAXIMUM DIFFICULTY Expert/1 Difficult (10+) Expert/2 Very Difficult (12+) Expert/3 Formidable (14+)

Specialised Computer: A computer can be designed for a specific purpose, which gives it a Processing Score of +1 or +2 higher for that software only. The navigation hand computer used by an explorer, for example, might be only a Computer/1 but could run the Navigation/3 software because it is specially designed for that task. A specialized computer costs 25% more per added rating – so, a Computer/1, Navigation/3 portable computer costs 150% of the cost of a basic Computer/1. At TL9 this would be Cr150.

**INTERFACES AND INTELLECTS** Choosing the right program to use on your computer is important and depends on what you are trying to do with the computer:

•  If you are just using the computer for general tasks, then all you need is a basic Interface/0.
•  If you are using the computer to access an Expert program, then you need Intelligent Interface to get the benefit. If you want the computer to do the work for you, then you need to run an Intellect program.

**COMPUTER VARIANTS** A computer's optimum Tech Level is the level at which it reaches standard production and is no longer considered a prototype or experiment. Most computing systems will be built at the optimal level or higher, to allow utilization of higher TL programs. Computers may be built at lower than optimum Tech Levels (Prototech) or reduced Tech Levels (Retrotech).

**Prototech:** A computer type may be produced at up to 2 levels below its optimum TL as a prototype (or reverse engineered experiment) or as a substandard but cheaper model. The system has its Processing and TL at normal values but cost and mass are multiplied by 10 for construction at one TL lower and 100 for construction at two TL lower.

For example, a TL10 Computer/2 salvaged from a mysterious alien wreck could be used to reverse engineer a Computer/2 by a TL8 society. It would run as a TL10 Computer/2, but would cost Cr50000 and mass 50kg.

RetroTech: While computers may be built at, and rated as, any TL above the optimum TL, a higher TL society may produce a lower rated TL system for reduced cost and mass. Any system may be built at any TL below the society's current level but not below the optimum TL for the model. Each reduced level halves the cost and mass of the basic model.

**EXPERT SKILLS** Having a tool or weapon with the appropriate Expert program and an Intelligent Interface can grant a Traveller DM+1 to relevant checks. However, the program can only help if the difficulty of the task is less than a certain value. In combat, add up any negative DMs to determine the effective difficulty of the attack or action.

Most of these supplies require a Traveller with the Medic skill to use properly. These items are, in the main, useful only in emergencies, such as when a Traveller is injured on a distant planet far away from a hospital facility.

Healing: An injured Traveller who needs hospital care for a prolonged period will pay approximately Cr250 per month per Tech Level (at TL11+ doctors may just use Medicinal Slow in many cases). Surgery costs 1D x Cr50 x Tech Level.

Replacements: A Traveller whose injuries require cloning limbs or cybernetic replacement must pay Cr5000 per characteristic point lost.

##### medical & care supplies

Cryoberth (TL10): A cryoberth, or 'icebox', is a coffin-like machine similar to the low or frozen berths used on some spacecraft. The main difference is that a cryoberth works much faster than a low berth, freezing and preserving its occupant almost instantly. A cryoberth can therefore be used to place a severely injured Traveller into stasis until they receive medical treatment. A cryoberth's internal power system can function for up to one week on its own but a berth is usually connected to a vehicle's or ship's power supply. Costs Cr50000 with a mass of 200kg.

Medikit (TL8+): There are different types of medikit available at different Tech Levels. All medikits contain diagnostic devices and scanners, surgical tools and a panoply of drugs and antibiotics, allowing a medic to practise their art in the field. Advanced medikits can help with more exotic problems or when treating augmented individuals. For example, a TL8 medikit can test blood pressure and temperature, while a TL14 kit has a medical densitometer to create a three-dimensional view of the patient's body and can scan brain activity on the quantum level. All medikits mass 1kg, except at TL14 where they have an effective mass of 0kg. TL8: Costs Cr1000. TL10: Grants DM+1 on Medic checks performed for first aid. Costs Cr1500. TL12: Grants DM+2 on Medic checks performed for first aid. Costs Cr5000. TL14: Grants DM+3 on Medic checks performed for first aid. Costs Cr10000.

Medikit

Metabolic Accelerator (TL10): These boost the user's reaction time to superhuman levels. To the user, everyone else appears to be moving much slower. A Traveller using a metabolic accelerator in combat gains DM+8 to all Initiative rolls. They also gain two free Reactions every round with no penalties applied for either. The drug kicks in 45 seconds after ingestion or injection and lasts for around 10 minutes. When the drug wears off, the user's system crashes. They suffer 2D points of damage and is Fatigued (see page 80). Metabolic accelerator costs Cr500 per dose.

Panaceas (TL8+): These are wide-spectrum medicinal drugs specifically designed not to interact harmfully. They can therefore be used on any wound or illness and are guaranteed not to make things worse. A Traveller using panaceas may make a Medic check as if they had Medic 0 when treating an infection or disease. Panaceas cost Cr200 per dose.

Slow Drug (TL11): This is a variant of the metabolic accelerator. It can only be applied safely in a medical facility where life-support and cryotechnology is available, as it increases the metabolism to around 30 times normal, allowing a patient to undergo a month of healing in a single day. Using this drug outside of a hospital or sickbay is a messy and painful way to commit suicide, as the user will rapidly cook their internal organs and suffer massive brain damage. Slow drug costs Cr500 per dose.

Stims (TL8): These relieve fatigue, although at a cost. A Traveller who uses stims removes Fatigue
(see page 80) but also sustains one point of damage. If stims are used repeatedly without natural sleep in between, the user suffers a cumulative additional point of damage every time (so, on the second use, two points of damage are sustained, on the third, three points and so on). Costs Cr50 per dose.

**DRUGS** There are several drugs (or 'meds') in standard use.

Anagathics (TL15): These slow the user's ageing process. Synthetic anagathics become possible at TL15 but there are natural spices and other rare compounds that have comparable effects. Anagathics are illegal or heavily controlled on many worlds. One dose must be taken each month to maintain the anti- aging effect. They cost Cr20000 per dose.

Anti-rad (TL8): Anti-rad drugs must be administered before or immediately (within 10 minutes) after radiation exposure. They absorb up to 100 rads per dose. A Traveller may only use anti-rad drugs once per day – taking any more causes permanent END damage of 1D per dose. Costs Cr1000 per dose.

Combat Drugs (TL10): Combat drugs increase reaction times and improve a body's responses to trauma. A Traveller using combat drugs gains DM+4 to all Initiative rolls. They also gain a free Reaction every round with no penalty applied and reduces all damage sustained by -2 points. The drug kicks in around 20 seconds (three rounds) after ingestion or injection and lasts for around 10 minutes. When the drug wears off, the user is Fatigued (see page 80). Combat drugs cost Cr1000 per dose.

Fast Drug (TL10): Also called Hibernation, this drug puts the user into a state akin to suspended animation, slowing their metabolic rate down to a ratio of 60:1 – a subjective day for the user is actually two months. Fast drug is normally used to prolong life support reserves or as a cheap substitute for a cryoberth. Fast drug costs Cr200 per dose.

Medicinal Drugs (TL5+): Includes vaccines, antitoxins and antibiotics. They range in cost from Cr5 to several thousand Credits, depending on the rarity and complexity. Medicinal drugs require the Medic skill to use properly – using the wrong drug can be worse than doing nothing.

Most sensors are designed to be plugged into a computer system but can display the data directly to the user on built-in screens or by feeding it to the user's suit display.

**Binoculars:** Allow the user to see further. TL8: Electronic enhancement allows images to be captured; light-intensification allows them to be used in the dark. TL12: PRIS (Portable Radiation Imaging System) allows the user to observe a large section of the EM- spectrum, from infrared to gamma rays.

**Bioscanner:** The bioscanner 'sniffs' for organic molecules and tests chemical samples, analysing the make-up of whatever it is focused on. It can be used to detect poisons or bacteria, analyse organic matter, search for life signs and classify unfamiliar organisms.

**Densitometer:** The remote densitometer uses an object's natural gravity to measure its density, building up a three-dimensional image of the inside and outside of an object.

**EM Probe:** This handy device detects the electro- magnetic emissions of technological devices and can be used as a diagnostic tool when examining equipment or when searching for hidden bugs or devices.

**Geiger Counter:** Detects radiation.

**IR Goggles:** Permits the user to see exothermic
(heat-emitting) sources in the dark.

**Light Intensifier Goggles:** Permits the users to see normally in anything less than total darkness by electronically intensifying any available light. TL9: Combines with IR goggles into a single unit.

**NAS:** The Neural Activity Scanner consists of a backpack and detachable handheld unit and can detect neural activity up to 500 meters away. The device can also give a rough estimation of the intelligence level of organisms based on brainwave patterns.

##### survival gear & supplies

On worlds and places hostile to human life, Travellers must use environmental suits to protect themselves. If colonies are established on such worlds, then the Imperium usually begins a terraforming process to transform the planet and make it more Earth-like.

Terraforming takes decades, even millennia, and is a ferociously expensive and intensive process. Sometimes, it might be easier to remake the colonists to fit the world using genetic engineering and surgery.

Artificial Gill

**Artificial Gill:** Extracts oxygen from water allowing the wearer to breathe underwater. Only works on worlds with breathable atmospheres (Atmosphere 4–9).

**Breather Mask:** Combines filter and respirator into a single package. TL10: The more advanced filter is small enough to fit into the nose or can even be a lung implant.

**Climbing Kit:** A set of accessories designed to make climbing easier. Includes a safety harness, gloves and rock shoes, belt with secure holders for tools and head protection. The kit provides DM+1 to attempts to climb rock surfaces. TL8: The kit includes a lightweight harness suitable for abseiling or rappelling, expanding mini-pitons for small rock crevices and more advanced versions of the accessories in the basic kit, providing DM+2 to attempts to climb rock surfaces.

**Environment Suit:** Designed to protect the wearer from extreme cold or heat, the environment suit has a hood, gloves and boots but leaves the face exposed in normal operations. A mask or rebreather can be attached but truly hostile situations call for the heavy- duty hostile environment vacc suit.

**Filter Mask:** Filters are breathing masks that strip out harmful elements from the air inhaled by the Traveller, such as dangerous gases or dust particles.

**Grav Belt:** A harness worn across the body, the grav belt is equipped with artificial gravity modules, allowing the Traveller to fly. The internal battery can be operated for a maximum of four hours before recharging. At TL15, the battery can operate for 12 hours before recharging. The grav belt allows the wearer to fly at Medium speed.

Habitat Module: A modular unpressurized quarters for six people, capable of withstanding anything less than hurricane-force winds. Includes survival rations and battery power to last a week. Requires 12 man- hours to assemble and can be attached to other modules to form a base. TL10: The TL10 module is pressurized and includes life-support for six occupants for one week (1,000 person/hours).

Portable Fusion Generator: This is a light-duty portable fusion generator, capable of recharging weapons and other equipment for up to one month of use.

Radiation Suit: A radiation suit protects the Traveller against direct radiation, such as solar flares or a reactor breach. A vacc suit will offer some protection but for areas of hard radiation a dedicated radiation suit is required, reducing exposure by 100 rads.

Rescue Bubble: A large (two meter diameter) plastic bubble. Piezoelectric layers in the bubble wall translate the user's movements into electricity to recharge the bubble's batteries and power its distress beacon and a small oxygen tank both inflates the bubble and provides two person/hours of life support. A self-repairing plastic seal serves as an emergency airlock. Rescue bubbles are found on both space and sea vessels as emergency lifeboats.

Respirator: This rebreather concentrates inhaled oxygen, allowing a Traveller to breathe on worlds with a thin atmosphere. Respirators take the form of a face mask or mouthpiece initially. TL10: The more advanced respirator is small enough to fit into the nose or can even be a lung implant.

Tent: A basic tent provides shelter for two people against the weather. TL7: The TL7 version can be pressurized. There is no airlock – the tent is depressurized when opened.

OPTIONS Climate Controlled (TL10): Structures can be given the climate-control option, allowing their internal temperature and other conditions to be controlled for comfort. Costs Cr500.

Self-Assembling (TL11): The self-assembling upgrade can be given to tents, habitat modules and other basic structures. The structure is capable of expanding and assembling itself with only minimal aid, reducing the time needed to set up the shelter to a single man-hour. Costs Cr5000.

Self-Sealing (TL13): Structures can be made self- repairing and self-sealing for Cr2000. Small breaches and rips are automatically fixed in seconds.

TOOLKITS Technical skills require specialist tools of various kinds. These kits contain diagnostic sensors, hand tools, computer analysis programs and spare parts.

Toolkits may be purchased at higher Tech Levels and will be much more capable at fulfilling tasks. If a toolkit is at least two Tech Levels higher than the item or task that is being worked upon, it will grant DM+2 to all related checks. However, if a toolkit is two Tech Levels or more lower than the item or task that is being worked on, it will inflict DM-2 on all related checks.

SCIENTIFIC TOOLKITS A scientific toolkit is a set of instruments and dedicated expert computer packaged to help a professional perform specific science-related tasks. The combination of tools and expert computer provides DM+2 to Science checks related to the toolkit's science-related speciality.

Toolkit instruments are specific to a speciality or related specialties of scientific endeavors. The tools alone will provide DM+1 to checks related to their specialities for Travellers who have at least Science 0 but will not aid an unskilled individual. Toolkit computers are tablets running Intellect and Expert software in the specified speciality. On their own they provide DM+1 to checks related to their specialities for Travellers who have at least Science 0 or allow unskilled Travellers to attempt Difficult (10+) or easier checks associated with the science speciality without an unskilled penalty.

Archaeology Science Toolkit: The archaeology toolkit provides tools for recovering and understanding the relics of past civilizations using the Science
(archaeology) skill. The kit does not contain large-scale excavating tools but includes deployable sensors for locating and observing buried objects, including small radar and lidar sensors, remote camera controllers and small observation drones. The toolkit's computing resources contain extensive databases of known relics and their context and a library of published papers. In addition, the archaeology toolkits will provide DM+1 to Science (history) checks related to archaeological finds.

Cybernetics Science Toolkit: This provides instruments to analyse, troubleshoot and repair cybernetic components using the Science (cybernetics) skill. These tools do not include equipment to construct new cybernetic components but do allow for the installation or reattachment of cybernetic components on a living being. The cybernetic toolkit also provides DM+1 to Medic checks involving the intersection of biological and cybernetic components. The toolkit also provides DM+1 to Electronics (computers) or Profession (robotics) checks to repair cybernetic components.

Life Sciences Toolkit: The life science toolkit contains tools to aid the performance of tasks with the Science specialities of biology, genetics and xenology. It contains biological sampling equipment, optical and electron microscopes, chemical analysis equipment and sequencers for DNA, proteins and other common life-related molecules. In addition, the toolkit can also aid in medical diagnosis, providing a DM+1 to Medic or Investigate checks to diagnose a medical condition.

Life Sciences Toolkit

Planetology Science Toolkit: This is a set of instruments intended to analyse the characteristics of a planetary environment using the Science (planetology) skill, applicable to the study of planets, asteroids, comets or other natural non-stellar bodies within a solar system. It contains atmospheric samplers, chemical analysis equipment focused on element and mineral composition of surface samples, ground monitoring sensors to sense seismic activity and analytics and display tools that provide a workup of atmosphere and surface composition, climatic conditions and rough internal planetary structure. Additionally, the planetology toolkit provides DM+1 to tasks related to the environment of solar system bodies using the Science specialities of astronomy, chemistry or physics, and DM+1 to tasks related to the environmental conditions of lifeforms using the Science specialities of biology, genetics or xenology.

Psionicology Science Toolkit: Since the psionicology toolkit is focused on the understanding of psionic talent using the Science (psionicology) skill, it is generally considered contraband on worlds that prohibit the use of psionics. On those worlds, toolkits might be in the hands of government operatives but outside the confines of law enforcement or government-sanctioned research mere possession could be a crime. The toolkit includes testing equipment to determine the latent PSI potential of an individual, including tests for PSI strength and understanding talents, which can be trained. The toolkit provides feedback analytics for both psionic training and diagnosis of psionic-related mental conditions or psionic blocks and includes a dose of inhibitor drug to temporarily limit psionic ability.

Robotics Science Toolkit: For use with the Science
(robotics) skill, this toolkit includes the tools to diagnose, repair and construct robotic components. It is not intended to allow for the construction of a robot but may aid in repair and enhancement. It includes debugging software for robotic brains, electronics tools to repair or create connections between robotic components and delicate mechanical tools to repair or assemble a robot. This toolkit also provides DM+1 to robotic related tasks performed using Electronics
(computers) or Profession (robotics).

Space Sciences Toolkit: The space sciences toolkit contains sensors and analytic tools valuable to performance of the Science skill specialities of astronomy and cosmology. It does not contain telescopes or other large sensors but does have equipment such as spectroscopic analysers and

interferometer calibrators, which aid in the use of those instruments and correlation of results. The toolkit's analytic engine allows an expert to predict conditions and locate planets around distant stars and allows for modelling of the risks of stellar activities such as flares and other magnetic disturbances, plus it can help identify the source of faint emissions across the electromagnetic spectrum. Within a solar system, the toolkit is focused on the properties of the system's stellar objects and general organization and development of smaller system bodies. When used in conjunction with tasks related to the study of planetary and smaller system bodies using the Science
(planetology) skill this toolkit provides DM+1.

**Physical Sciences Toolkit:** This toolkit provides instruments and analytic tools for the performance of the Science skill specialities of chemistry and physics. These tools including sampling equipment, chemical analysis tools, sensors to detect electromagnetic or gravitic radiation and ultrasensitive measurement equipment. The toolkit can help a specialist analyse unknown minerals, physical phenomena and the basic composition and properties of everything from atoms to stars. The toolkit can also aid the Science specialities of astronomy and planetology by providing DM+1 in tasks which directly involve the measurement of physical and chemical properties.

**Social Science Expert Packages:** Social sciences do not generally require tools but access to methodologies, data collection algorithms and large libraries of information, both qualitative and quantitative. Social science expert packages are installed on specialized dedicated computer tablets running Intellect and Expert software in the speciality. These computers contain extensive databases and analysis engines for social science specialities and provide DM+2 to checks in the speciality. Travellers unskilled in the Science speciality of the Expert system may interact with the computer to understand or complete tasks of up to Very Difficult (12+) complexity with effective skill level 1 in the system's speciality. Specific library packages apply to the economics, history, linguistics, philosophy, psychology and sophontology specialities.

More obscure packages for esoteric social science specialties may also exist, but may be difficult to locate, expensive, or of questionable reliability.

##### Melee weapons

With the advent of powered armor and portable fusion generators, the line between personal weapon and heavy artillery is blurred. The high-end weapons available in the Imperium are staggeringly powerful. Few private citizens can obtain such weapons legally but small brush wars can turn into alarming plasma- fired conflagrations when mercenaries are involved.

Melee weapons are a symbol of status among the nobility of many worlds but they also serve a useful purpose in boarding actions. When attempting to capture an enemy vessel, a sword is much less likely to cause significant damage to vulnerable systems or cause a hull breach than a gun but is better at opening a self-sealing vacc suit to the airless cold of space.

These weapons require the Melee skill, using the blade speciality if they have a sharp edge, bludgeon if they do not and unarmed if you are left with nothing but your fists; though fists are a poor substitute against a better prepared enemy.

Shield

**Blade:** A small blade weapon, somewhere between a dagger and a cutlass.

**Broadsword:** A heavy two-handed sword.

**Club:** The first weapon emerging civilizations usually discover. Clubs can range from a length of heavy wood to extending riot batons of advanced polymers but they remain a popular and practical weapon regardless.

**Cutlass:** The standard shipboard blade weapon, often kept near airlocks to repel boarders.

**Dagger:** A small knife weapon, approximately 20–30 centimeters in length.

**Improvised:** Sometimes a Traveller just has to use whatever comes to hand. This covers any non- weapon object a Traveller grabs during a fight.

**Rapier:** A duelling foil. Rapiers grant DM+1 for parrying.

**Shield:** A Traveller using a shield increases their effective Melee skill by +1 when parrying. A Traveller with no Melee skill counts as having Melee 1 when using a shield to parry.

**Staff:** A length of wood or metal.

**Stunstick:** A short and innocuous looking weapon, this ceramic stick can deliver a painful and debilitating shock to anyone who touches the wrong end.

##### slug throwers

Despite advances in energy weapons and other offensive technologies, accelerating a small piece of metal to high velocity is still one of the most efficient ways of killing someone. Chemically propelled firearms give way to gyrojet (rocket bullets) and gauss (electromagnetically launched bullets) as technology advances.

These weapons require the Gun Combat (slug) skill.

**Accelerator Rifle:** Also known as gyrojet weapons, accelerator rifles are designed for zero-gravity combat. They fire tiny missiles that leave the rifle with minimal velocity and thus minimal recoil, then accelerate to high speed.

**Advanced Combat Rifle:** The ultimate evolution of the conventional firearm, advanced combat rifles are the weapon of choice for many military units. Standard equipment includes an electronic battlefield sight, incorporating both light amplification and passive IR, visual magnification and a laser rangefinder, which may also be used as a target painting device. The weapon is also gyroscopically stabilized during firing. A sling is provided and the muzzle of the rifle includes an integral flash suppressor and adaptor for launching a 40mm RAM shoot-through grenade.

**Antique Pistol:** A flintlock or other primitive projectile weapon. Unless the weapon is especially well made, it will have DM-1 to all attacks. Antique pistols require a successful Gun Combat (slug) check to reload, taking 2D3 Minor Actions.

**Antique Rifle:** A musket or other primitive rifle. Unless the weapon is especially well made, it will have DM-1 to all attacks. Antique rifles require a successful Gun Combat (slug) check to reload, taking 2D3 Minor Actions.

**Autopistol:** Variants of this semi-automatic pistol is the standard sidearm for law enforcement officers and criminals across the Imperium.

**Autorifle:** Automatic rifles have a higher muzzle velocity and are capable of automatic fire. Sometimes called battle rifles.

**Body Pistol:** Body pistols are manufactured from plastics and cultured bone, making them very difficult to detect using conventional weapons scanners. Body pistols impose DM-4 to any Electronics (sensors) checks made to detect them.

**Gauss Pistol:** Gauss pistols use electromagnetic coils to accelerate metallic darts to hypersonic speeds. Gauss weapons are lightweight, efficient and deadly.

Gauss Rifle: Gauss rifles replace conventional rifles at TL13. Like the smaller gauss pistol, rifles fire high- velocity projectiles using electromagnetic rails.

**Revolver:** A conventional six-shooter handgun.

**Rifle:** A long-range hunting rifle or light infantry weapon.

Shotgun: Shotguns are smoothbore weapons that typically fire ammunition containing multiple small pellets. They are most effective at short range. A shotgun using pellet ammunition ignores Dodge dice modifiers but armor gives double Protection against pellet attacks.

Snub Pistol: These lightweight, low-recoil weapons were designed for use aboard spacecraft and in zero gravity.

Submachine Gun: A short weapon capable of automatic fire, it puts the power of an assault rifle into a small package. However, it lacks a rifle's accuracy at range.

Directed-energy weapons first enter the battlefield as target designators and range-finders but by TL9 weapons capable of inflicting damage directly appear. Laser weapons require a power supply – pistols come with a belt- or wrist-mounted power pack, while rifles come with backpacks connected by a cable. As the Tech Level increases, power packs gradually become integrated into the weapons themselves.

All energy weapons come with a power pack that can be recharged using a ship's power plant or another power source. It takes eight hours to recharge a power pack and switching from one pack to another is a Minor Action.

These weapons require the Gun Combat (energy) skill.

Laser Pistol

Laser Pistol: The TL9 pistol is bulky but effective, with no recoil and a large magazine. At TL11, advances in battery technology and miniaturization mean the pistol is no larger than a conventional firearm but must still be connected to a battery pack for sustained use.

Laser Carbine: Laser carbines are shorter and lighter than laser rifles and have a correspondingly shorter range.

Laser Rifle: Laser rifles are highly accurate at long range and are powered by heavy backpacks.

Laser Sniper Rifle: A six-shot model designed to be used for mobile sniping. The power pack is integrated into the weapon itself, removing the need for a heavy backpack.

Plasma Rifle: TL16 technology allows the bulky reactor and plasma chamber of the PGHP to be made small enough to fit into a rifle frame. The plasma rifle is a high-powered weapon designed to crack battle dress.

Stunner: A non-lethal weapon designed to inflict a massive shock to the target, incapacitating it.

##### grenade weapons

These weapons are thrown or launched at an enemy and are typically designed to affect several targets across a wide area at once.

Thrown grenades use the Athletics (dexterity) skill, while those that are launched use the Heavy Weapons
(portable) skill.

Missed attacks with grenades will generally result in nothing interesting happening unless there are dangerous or amusing targets nearby, at the discretion of the referee.

Aerosol: Aerosol grenades create a fine mist that diffuses any lasers that are fired into or through it but the mist does not block normal vision. Any laser attack tracing a line of sight into or through the mist has its damage reduced by -10. Laser communications are completely blocked by the mist. Aerosol clouds dissipate after 1D x 3 rounds, although heavy winds and rain can drastically reduce this time.

Frag: Fragmentation grenades explode in a blast of shrapnel designed to kill or cripple anyone close by.

Smoke: Smoke grenades creates a thick cloud that disrupts vision. This imposes DM-2 to all attacks on targets within the cloud. IR vision completely bypasses this cloud of smoke. Smoke clouds dissipate after 1D x 3 rounds, although heavy winds and rain can drastically reduce this time.

Stun: Stun grenades release a powerful pulse of energy, usually in the form or light and/or sound that incapacitates targets rather than killing them.

##### heavy weapons

These are among the most powerful weapons to appear on the battlefield and require special training to use effectively. Only those mounted on vehicles and ships will be more powerful at any equivalent Tech Level.

These weapons require the Heavy Weapons
(portable) skill.

**FGHP:** The ultimate personal firearm, the Fusion Gun, Human Portable (similar weapons are available for other alien species) is more like a piece of artillery. It includes a gravity suspension system to reduce its inertia and fires what amounts to a directed nuclear explosion. Those without radiation protection who are nearby when a FGHP is fired will suffer a potentially lethal dose of radiation.

**Grenade Launcher:** Grenade launchers are used to fire grenades over long distances. They may be equipped with any normal type of grenade.

**Machinegun:** A larger and less portable version of the autorifle, the machinegun may be relatively low tech but it is capable of sawing even armored targets in half.

**PGHP:** The Plasma Gun, Human Portable is the standard assault weapon of the marines. It is so heavy and bulky that it can only be used easily by a trooper in battle dress. It is powered by a built-in micro-fusion generator and fires a high-energy plasma stream. More advanced plasma guns adjust the weapon's optimum range and plasma temperature.

**RAM Grenade Launcher:** Rocket Assisted Multi- purpose grenade launchers have a longer range and are capable of firing up to three grenades with a single attack. They may be equipped with any normal type of grenade.

**Rocket Launcher:** A simple tube device that launches rockets. Anyone standing behind a rocket launcher when it is fired will be caught in its back blast and suffer 3D damage from the burning gasses. It takes three Minor Actions to reload a rocket launcher.

The Explosives skill is used with explosives. Multiply the damage of the explosives by the Effect of the Explosives check used to set them.

Doubling the amount of explosives used will increase the Damages by 1D and the Blast by +1. Continually doubling the amount of explosives used will have a cumulative effect.

Weapons can be customised to a massive degree. Listed here are just some of the more popular choices.

##### weapon options

**Auxiliary Grenade Launcher (TL7):** An underslung grenade launcher can be added to any rifle weapon at the cost of Cr1000. This grenade launcher has a magazine of one grenade and takes three minor actions to reload. Otherwise, it is identical to the grenade launcher on page 133.

**Gyrostabilizer (TL9):** Stabilizers can be added to any Bulky weapon, reducing its recoil and removing the Bulky trait at a cost of Cr500. They cannot be added to any Destructive weapon.

**Intelligent Weapon (TL11):** This adds Computer/0 to any weapon. Costs Cr1000. TL13: This adds Computer/1 to any weapon. Costs Cr5000.

**Laser Sight (TL8):** Integrated optics and laser sights grant DM+1 to any attack made at less than 50 meters. Costs Cr200. TL10: Ultraviolet lasers and improved display technology removes the tell-tale 'red dot' of a vislight laser.

Scope (TL5): A high-quality telescopic scope for attachment to a rifle or heavy weapon, allowing accurate shots to be made at extreme ranges. Any rifle or heavy weapon equipped with this gains the Scope trait. Costs Cr50. TL7: Adds image enhancement and light intensification, allowing the scope to be used in low- light environments without penalty.

Secure Weapon (TL10): A secure weapon requires authentication in some fashion (scanning the user's DNA or iris patterns, entering a password, transmission of an unlocking code from a comm) before it can be fired. Costs Cr250.

Suppressor (TL8): A suppressor can be added to any non-automatic slug thrower, masking the sound produced by firing. Costs Cr250.

# VEHICLES

From a simple horse drawn cart to a jet fighter, from a bicycle to a multi-turreted, super heavy grav tank, billions of vehicles exist across the galaxy. They serve as transportation systems that allow people to travel further, faster, while taking more with them.

Travellers will come into contact with many vehicles of different types and it is important they know how all function.

All vehicles share some common characteristics. The example shown here is a simple ground car found on most low-Tech Level industrialised worlds.

MOVEMENT While the distance a Traveller, alien or animal can move is listed in meters per combat round, vehicles are capable of travelling much, much faster. For this reason, the rate at which a vehicle is moving is determined by Speed Bands, as shown on the Speed Bands table. This table shows the relative speed each Speed band represents in kilometers per hour for reference.

A vehicle may change its current speed by one Speed Band at the start of every combat round if it is travelling at Fast speed or less, or by one Speed Band every minute if it is travelling faster. Travellers on foot will typically use the Idle band.

The Speed Band Number is a useful abbreviation of the Speed Bands and is used for some rules a little further on.

Speed Bands Speed Band Speed Band Number Kilometers per Hour Stopped 0 0 Idle 1 1–20 Very Slow 2 20–50 Slow 3 50–100 Medium 4 100–200 High 5 200–300 Fast 6 300–500 Very Fast 7 500–800 Subsonic 8 800–1,200 Supersonic 9 1,200–6,000 Hypersonic 10 6,000 or more

ROUGH TERRAIN The listed speed for any ground vehicle is what is normally attainable on a relatively flat or even surface, such as a road, track or short grass. If a ground vehicle
(any vehicle that uses the Drive skill) is taken off-road, the going will get more difficult.

Any ground vehicle going off-road will suffer DM-2 to all checks to control it and its maximum speed is reduced by two Speed Bands.

Some terrain is classed as Rough and cannot be traversed at all by most ground vehicles. Rough terrain comprises heavy forest, very broken ground, hills with 20–50% slopes, and similar ground.

A vehicle that is noted as being off-road capable, or requires the Drive (track) skill, does not suffer any penalties when it is driven off-road and can even negotiate rough terrain with care. Such vehicles can cross rough terrain while suffering DM-2 to all checks to control them and reducing their maximum speed by two Speed Bands.

AIRBORNE MOVEMENT Most aircraft (vehicles that use the Flyer skill) are designed for a specific atmosphere and planetary gravity. This means aircraft can only fly on worlds with Size and Atmosphere codes within two of their world of creation.

For example, an aircraft manufactured on a world with Size 7 and Atmosphere 7 could function properly on worlds with Atmosphere 5–9, and Size 5–9.

Aircraft suffer DM-1 to all checks made to control them if they are not within their home Atmosphere and/or Size codes and cannot fly at all if they are operating beyond the range listed above.

In any case, aircraft require a minimum Atmosphere 1 in order to function.

GRAV VEHICLES Vehicles using the Flyer (grav) skill employ anti-gravity technology rather than traditional methods of flight and so are unaffected by the Atmosphere and Size of worlds they travel on.

EQUIPMENT AND WEAPONS Entertainment system, Navigation system (basic)

ARMOR FRONT 2 REAR 2 SIDES 2

TL: The lowest Tech Level the vehicle is available at.

Skill: Which skill is used to drive or pilot the vehicle.

**Agility:** How easy the vehicle is to drive or pilot. This is applied as a DM to all checks made to control the vehicle.

Speed: The maximum Speed Band the vehicle is capable of travelling.

Range: The maximum distance the vehicle can travel without refuelling.

**Armor:** Similar to the armor worn by Travellers, this is how well the vehicle can resist damage.

Equipment & Traits: Any included equipment or special rules that are applied to the vehicle.

**Crew:** How many crew members the vehicle requires.

**Passengers:** How many additional passengers can be carried.

Cargo: How much cargo the vehicle can carry, in tons.

Shipping: How much space the vehicle will require for transport on a spacecraft.

**Hull:** A measure of how much damage the vehicle can sustain before it is destroyed or rendered inoperable.

Cost: How much it costs to purchase the vehicle.

CRUISING SPEED The Speed of vehicles in Traveller shows the maximum rate at which the vehicle can normally travel. The Range will show the distance they can travel while at this maximum speed.

However, most vehicles will rarely travel at their maximum speed and will instead cruise to maintain a better balance of speed and endurance. The cruising speed of any vehicle is assumed to be one Speed Band lower than the vehicle's maximum speed and if it maintains this rate of movement, its Range will increase by 50%.

COMBAT Combat in and on vehicles is much the same as ordinary combat, although there are some differences.

•  Unlike people, who are mobile and manoeuvrable, careful track must be kept of which way a vehicle is facing. Vehicle-mounted weapons and to a lesser extent armed passengers, are restricted to certain fire arcs.
•  Vehicles are considered to move on the driver's Initiative. The driver must spend a Minor Action every round to keep control of the vehicle under normal circumstances – a straight road or simple maneuvers – or a Significant Action to navigate obstacles, conduct evasion or pursue a target.

CLOSED VEHICLES Closed vehicles include typical cars, g/carriers, tanks and other vehicles with crew and passengers within a protective enclosed hull. All vehicles are assumed to be closed unless otherwise stated.

•  Closed vehicles grant cover to any visible occupants, with a bonus equal to the Armor of the vehicle in the facing from which the attack originates.
•  Any occupants not visible cannot be directly attacked at all.
•  Only a few people in a closed vehicle can shoot out, depending on the number of windows or other firing ports and the internal space available. Unless the description mentions otherwise up to two people can fire into each arc from a civilian vehicle and one person in each arc in a military one.

OPEN VEHICLES Open vehicles include motorbikes, air/rafts and other vehicles where the occupants are exposed. If a vehicle is open, this will be stated in its description under Equipment & Traits.

•  Open vehicles grant no cover to the passengers.
•  Any passenger in an open vehicle can shoot (or otherwise attack) in any direction.

VEHICULAR ACTIONS These are all significant actions that the driver (or pilot) of a vehicle can perform during their turn in a combat round. All skill checks used in these actions use the Agility of the vehicle as a DM.

Dogfight: A vehicle within one kilometer and within one Speed Band of another may initiate a dogfight. This is a series of maneuvers whereby the driver of one vehicle attempts to gain a position of advantage over another and, hopefully, destroy it.

The drivers of both vehicles make opposed skill checks using the skill appropriate to their vehicle (Drive, Flyer, or Seafarer), modified by their vehicle's Agility as normal. For every additional enemy engaging in the dogfight, DM-1 is applied.

A draw means that neither vehicle may attack the other unless it possesses a weapon in a turret. The winner may choose to place their opponent's vehicle in a fire arc of their choice and may choose which of the opposing vehicle's fire arcs their own vehicle lies in.

In this way, the winner of a dogfight can ensure all their forward facing weapons can attack their enemy while ensuring they stay out of their opponent's forward facing (and the weapons present there). In addition, the winner of a dogfight gains DM+2 to all their attack rolls for this round while the loser suffers DM-2.

If one of the vehicles' drivers chooses to initiate a dogfight again in the following combat round, the winner of the previous dogfight applies the difference between that round's opposed check as a positive DM to this round's opposed check.

Evasive Action: The driver may declare they are taking evasive action when their turn arrives. They make a skill check (the skill being determined by the type of vehicle and do not forget to apply the vehicle's Agility!) and the Effect acts as a negative DM to all attacks against the vehicle or its passengers. The Effect also acts as a negative DM to any attacks made

from the vehicle too, as the sudden movement will make aimed attacks difficult. This lasts until the driver's next action.

**Maneuver:** A driver can maneuver their vehicle without making any skill checks. This allows the vehicle to avoid large or obvious obstacles, get to where it is going, move out of one fire arc of an enemy vehicle and into a different one, or change the fire arc a single target is in. More extreme maneuvers are covered by the Stunt action.

Ram: Deliberately driving a vehicle into someone or something requires a significant action and a successful skill check (skill determined by vehicle). Ram attacks are affected by dodging and evasive action as normal. The referee may grant bonuses to a ram attempt or declare it automatically successful if the target is particularly large or stationary.

Stunt: With a successful skill check the driver or pilot can do pretty much anything it is possible to do in their vehicle – stand a car up on two wheels, perform stunning aerobatics in a jet fighter or skim a speedboat over a low sandbar. A stunt can be used to put a single target into one additional fire arc for one round (putting an enemy vehicle into both front and rear arcs by spinning a car, for example), to set up some other skill check (often allowing passengers to line up weapons) using the rules for task chains on page 63, to achieve something that would normally be very difficult or impossible in the vehicle (driving down an alley too narrow for the car by flipping it onto two wheels), to achieve up to three maneuver actions in one go, just to show off, or anything else you can imagine. The referee is free to set the difficulty of the skill check to reflect the attempted action.

**Weave:** In an environment with many obstacles, such as an inner city or tight underground caverns, a driver or pilot may choose to weave their vehicle in and around obstacles at high speed in order to evade pursuit. The driver chooses a weaving score, between one and their current Speed Band Number and must then make a skill check (skill determined by vehicle) with the weaving score as a negative DM on this check. If they fail, they have driven/flown into an obstacle and crashed. If they succeed, any pursuers must also choose a weave action in their turn and make the skill check at the same penalty with the same consequence for failure. Alternatively, they can choose to break off pursuit and either give up or try to reacquire the target later.

VEHICLE WEAPONS Attacking with ranged weapons mounted upon a vehicle uses the same rules as detailed in the Combat chapter, with the following exceptions:

•  Firing a vehicle-mounted weapon uses the Heavy Weapons (vehicle) skill.
•  The Range of weapons designed to be mounted on vehicles is noted in kilometers, not meters.
•  All weapons mounted on a closed vehicle may not be used to attack targets within 5% of the weapon's Range. They are simply not designed to engage close targets.
•  Note that unless a vehicle-mounted weapon has the Scope trait (see page 79), all attacks made at a range greater than one kilometer (as opposed to 100 meters for Travellers shooting on foot) are automatically considered to be Extreme range.
•  Weapons mounted on vehicles are subject to fire arcs.
•  An additional DM-1 is imposed on all attack rolls for every Speed Band difference between the attacker and its target. This applies to Passengers firing from the vehicle as well.

FIRE ARCS Weapons mounted on vehicles are limited in what direction they can fire. A weapon mounted in the front arc, for example, can only fire into a 90o area in front of the vehicle. Weapons in turrets can fire in any direction.

What weapons a vehicle has in which fire arcs is listed in its description.

Examples of Fire Arcs

90 o Pintle Mount Rear Facing Fire Arc

90 o Pintle Mount Left Facing Fire Arc

90 o Pintle Mount Right Facing Fire Arc

360 o Turret Fire Arc

Fixed Mount Forward Facing Fire Arc

Fixed Mount Rear Facing Fire Arc

DAMAGING VEHICLES Once the total amount of damage a weapon is causing has been calculated, any armor the vehicle has is deducted from it. Some vehicles have different armor scores on different facings – the armor used against a weapon is always the facing the attack is made from. Basically, if an attack is made to the side of a vehicle, the vehicle will use its side armor against the attack.

The remaining damage is the total that is removed from the vehicle's Hull. Once a vehicle has been reduced to zero Hull, it is wrecked and becomes totally inoperable and is normally beyond any repair although parts may be salvaged.

VEHICLE ARMOR Even on dedicated military vehicles, the roof and floor tend to be weak points in their structure that a canny enemy can exploit. Unless otherwise stated, all vehicles will use half the value of their side armor against attacks on the roof and half the value of their rear armor against attacks on the floor.

LIGHT WEAPONS Most weapons carried by Travellers, such as pistols, rifles and lasers, are not well-suited to destroying vehicles and their effects are greatly weakened.

Against any weapon that has less than Damage 4D or has the Stun trait, a vehicle will have an extra amount of armor equal to its TL on each facing.

LARGE VEHICLES Vehicles, by their nature, tend to be large machines and are much easier to hit than a ducking Traveller. Attack rolls against vehicles gain DM+1, plus an additional DM+1 for every full 10 tons of their Shipping score (to a maximum of DM+6).

CRITICAL HITS If an attack roll against a vehicle has an Effect of 6 or higher and it causes damage (rather than just bouncing off armor), a critical hit has been scored – some vital system has been damaged by the attack, reducing the effectiveness of the vehicle.

If a critical hit has been inflicted upon a vehicle, roll 2D and then consult the Critical Hits Location table. If a particular location does not apply to this vehicle, roll again.

The Severity of the critical hit is equal to the Effect of the attack roll minus 5. Consult the Critical Hit Effects table to determine the nature of the critical hit and how

it affects the vehicle. Any extra damage caused by the effects of critical hits ignores the vehicle's Armor.

If a vehicle has already sustained a critical hit to a location that receives another, use the Severity of the new critical hit or the original plus one, whichever is higher and immediately apply any new effects. Once a location has reached Severity 6, it cannot suffer any more critical hits. Instead, the vehicle will receive 6D extra damage every time the location suffers another critical hit.

Sustained Damage A vehicle will also have its components degraded through sustaining constant damage. Every time a vehicle sustains damage equalling 10% of its starting Hull score, roll 2D and then consult the Critical Hits Location table. The vehicle will suffer a Severity 1 critical hit to that location.

COLLISIONS When a vehicle collides with something else – a Traveller, another vehicle or obstacle – both take damage. Roll 1D for every Speed Band Number the vehicle was travelling at during the time of impact. This is applied as damage directly to anything hit and, if the object struck is solid enough, also to the ramming vehicle.

In a head-on collision between two vehicles, the Speed Band Numbers of both are added to calculate the collision damage.

Any unsecured passengers in a vehicle damaged in a collision take the same damage and, in open vehicles, are thrown 10 meters for every Speed Band Number. Damage to passengers involved in collisions ignores any personal armor.

Secured passengers (those wearing seatbelts or something similar) are not thrown anywhere and take one quarter of this damage.

REPAIRING VEHICLES A vehicle that has suffered Hull damage may be repaired in any facility with suitable maintenance capabilities. An Average (8+) Mechanic check (1D hours +1 per point of damage, INT or EDU) is required to make the repairs and this will consume spare parts costing Cr500 per point of damage repaired.

Any critical hit may be repaired with an Average (8+) Mechanic check (1D hours, INT or EDU), using its Severity as a negative DM.

All weapons and equipment that are destroyed by critical hits will have to be completely replaced at full cost.

VEHICLE WEAPONS These are among the more common weapons fitted to vehicles in an effort to bring heavier firepower to the battlefield.

All these weapons require the Heavy Weapons
(vehicle) skill. Note that, for these weapons, ranges are listed in kilometers and tons are used instead of kilograms for mass.

Cannon : A large calibre gun used to arm the heavy tanks and armored vehicles of mid-Tech Level armies.

Laser Cannon : A single barrel laser main gun for a vehicle, the laser cannon is the first truly effective vehicle energy weapon.

Light Autocannon : This is a conventional autocannon, of 20–25mm calibre. It is designed to destroy light vehicles and massed infantry.

VEHICLE EQUIPMENT The following items can be found on vehicles as part of their standard specification or may be added later. Equipment and weapons may be mounted on any vehicle that has enough spare cargo space. Items massing less than 250kg do not require any cargo space in a vehicle.

Aquatic Drive : This equips the vehicle with a watertight hull, props or water jets, and a snorkel, allowing it to traverse liquid surfaces. When in the water, the vehicle will suffer DM-1 to all checks to control it and Range will be reduced to a quarter of its original score and maximum Speed will drop by two Speed Bands. Vehicles must be designed with aquatic drives in mind and cannot be modified to use them.

Autopilot : At TL5 autopilots only function on aircraft and sea vessels but become available to all vehicles at TL9. They allow the complete autonomous function of a vehicle and are considered to have a Drive, Flyer or Seafarer skill level of 0. This skill level increases by
+1 every two Tech Levels thereafter to a maximum of three. There is an additional cost of Cr5000 for every skill, on top of the basic cost of the autopilot.

Communications : Most communications systems use some form of electromagnetic radiation, such as radio, laser or maser. At higher Tech Levels, meson

communicators become possible. The standard range of the communications system is five kilometers but the range of any communicator can be multiplied by itself by doubling the cost. TL6 : Range increases to 50km. TL8 : Range increases to 500km and can communicate with overhead satellites. Can also use lasers or masers to precisely aim a signal so it cannot be intercepted. TL15 : Range increase to 5,000km.

Entertainment System : At lower Tech Levels this will be purely audio but video becomes possible very quickly. The cost indicated represents a basic entertainment system found on many stock civilian vehicles but Travellers are welcome to spend almost any amount to create a custom entertainment system that could be fairly described as 'well banging, innit'.

Navigation : From simple GPS systems to intelligent location-scanning guidance systems, this equipment helps a vehicle's crew find their way around. Provides DM+1 to all Navigation checks. Improved: Provides DM+2 to all Navigation checks. Advanced: Provides DM+3 to all Navigation checks.

Off-road : Any vehicle that uses the Drive skill may be modified to go off-road. This lowers the Speed of the vehicle by one Speed Band and costs 50% of what the vehicle itself originally cost.

Sensors : At low Tech Levels, sensors may be little more than headlights and a pair of binoculars but as technology increases, they become increasingly more

sophisticated and capable. Even basic civilian vehicles may start to sport radar, densitometers and thermal systems. The range of basic sensors is one kilometer but note that Tech Level is a very important component to the capability of sensors. For every three Tech Levels above TL5, increase the cost of the sensors by +50%. Improved : Provides DM+1 to all Electronics (sensors) checks and increases range to 5km. Advanced : Provides DM+2 to all Electronics (sensors) checks and increases range to 25km.

Short Term Life Support : This provides a breathable atmosphere inside a closed vehicle for one day, no matter the exterior conditions. The cost is for every person the system must support.

Turret : The addition of a small turret allows a vehicle- mounted weapon to track and target any enemy within line of sight, without being restricted by fire arcs. A turret will mass an amount equal to the weapons it holds and cost Cr10000 for every ton.

Weapons : A vehicle may have weapons installed simply by paying the cost of the weapon, which will then consume Cargo space. Unless a turret is also installed, the weapon will be upon a fixed mount that can only fire into a specific arc (see page 139). A vehicle may be mounted with one weapon for every 10 points of Hull or part of.

Personal weapons (such as rifles) may be mounted upon a vehicle and these will consume no cargo space. However, it will cost Cr1000 to sufficiently modify a vehicle for each weapon installed if a turret is not used.

# SPACECRAFT OPERATIONS

This chapter covers operations and encounters in space, other than combat between spacecraft (refer to the Space Combat chapter). Ship captains are advised to read this chapter carefully as it contains everything needed to operate and maintain a spacecraft during day-to-day activities.

SPACECRAFT The term spacecraft covers any interplanetary or interstellar vehicle – anything that can travel through space under its own power. There are subdivisions of spacecraft that further define these vessels.

Ship: A spacecraft of 100 tons or more. Small Craft: A spacecraft of less than 100 tons. Small craft are incapable of jumping to other star systems. [[Capital]] Ship: A ship of more than 5,000 tons. System Ship: A ship without jump drives. Streamlined Hull: A ship designed to fly through atmosphere – will feature a wing or lifting body. Partially Streamlined Hull: These ships may enter atmospheres but are not specifically designed to do so and are extremely ungainly. Unstreamlined Hull: These ships are completely non-aerodynamic. While they can potentially enter atmospheres, this tends to be very dangerous.

The size of a ship, its components and cargo is measured in displacement tons or simply tons. A displacement ton displaces a volume equal to one ton of liquid hydrogen. One displacement ton is roughly equal to 14 cubic meters.

BUYING A SHIP Spacecraft are eye-wateringly expensive to the extent that, ordinarily, only the very rich, governments or large corporations can afford them. However, an industry of ship mortgages has sprung up that allows individual Travellers at least the dream of owning their own ship, although the repayments can be suitably astronomical and may force them to make less than noble decisions in order to meet bills charged every four weeks (this is the basis and driving force of many Traveller campaigns).

The monthly repayments on a ship mortgage are easy to calculate. Start with the total purchase price of the ship being bought, then divide this amount by 240.

This is the amount that must be repaid every Maintenance Period for the next 40 years.

CAREER BENEFITS It is possible for some Travellers to receive a ship as a Benefit when leaving a career, such as a merchant receiving a free trader or a scholar receiving a laboratory ship. This represents them buying a ship earlier in life and a proportion of the mortgage will have already been paid off.

Every time a ship is rolled as a Benefit, 25% of the original mortgage has been paid off. In practice, the Traveller may choose to continue to pay the calculated mortgage for 10 years less every time the Benefit is rolled (continuing the mortgage) and pay their ship off faster, or deduct 25% from the purchase price of the ship before calculating the mortgage cost (effectively re-mortgaging) to be paying less every four weeks.

SHIP SHARES Individual ship shares may also be earned during careers, each worth MCr1. If they are put towards the purchase of a ship, deduct MCr1 from the purchase cost of the ship for every share, then calculate the mortgage.

SPACE AND TIME The following units of measurement are used to describe astronomical distances.

Astronomic Unit: The distance between the Earth and the Sun – 149,597,870 kilometers. Light Second: The distance light travels in one second – 299,792 kilometers. Light Minute: 17,987,547 kilometers. Light Year: 9,460,730,472,580.8 kilometers. Parsec: Parallax of one second of arc – 30.857 x 1012 kilometers or 3.262 light years.

Ships Name : What you name your ship can define its personality.

Armor : This provides protection against attacks.

Systems : Other ships systems can be listed here.

Power Points : How much power the ship has to make everything function.

Class : What type of ship is it?

Hull Points : The life blood of the ship.

Sensors : Sensors are basically the eyes of the ship.

Ships Computer : The brain of the beast along with all of the software programs it can run.

Costs : Handy areas for the basic maintenance and operation costs of the ship. So you never need to be late with a payment.

Weapons : If your ship has any weapons they can be listed here.

Drives : Is your ship a speedster, a jumper or good at dodging?

Cargo Hold Content : The most important part of the sheet for any Trader Travellers.

Critical Hits: You really want to avoid anyone touching this section.

AIRLOCKS A ship has at least one airlock per 500 tons. The average airlock is large enough for three people in vacc suits to pass through. An airlock takes 10 seconds to cycle. Under normal circumstances, airlocks are locked down from the bridge and require a Very Difficult (12+) Electronics (computers) check to override from either the interior or exterior of the ship. An unlocked airlock can be triggered from outside. Airlocks generally have vacc suits (see page 102), rescue bubbles (see page 119) and cutlasses (see page 125) in lockers nearby.

Ships with cargo space have cargo hatches, which can effectively be used as an ad hoc airlock if needed.

ATMOSPHERIC OPERATIONS A streamlined ship is designed to enter a planetary atmosphere and can function like a conventional aircraft. Pilot checks are required in high winds and other extreme weather.

Partial streamlining allows a ship to skim gas giants and enter Atmosphere codes of 3 or less, acting in the same way as streamlined ships. In other atmospheres, the ship will be ponderous and unresponsive, reliant on its thrusters to keep it aloft. All Pilot checks will be made with DM-2.

An unstreamlined ship is completely non-aerodynamic and if it enters an atmosphere it runs the risk of sustaining serious damage. Such a ship must make a Pilot check at DM-4 when it enters an atmosphere and for every minute of flight. Each failed check inflicts 1D damage to the ship, ignoring any Armor.

DOCKING AND LANDING These two procedures are routine and performed whenever a ship travels between systems, so ship captains should be very familiar with their operation. Note the rules for atmospheric operation will apply whenever a ship lands on a planet with an atmosphere.

LANDING Landing at a starport requires a Routine (6+) Pilot check
(1D x 10 seconds) but most pilots will take 1D minutes to perform a landing and gain DM+2 on the task.

Ships have landing gear, allowing them to touch down
'in the wild', which requires an Average (8+), Difficult
(10+) or even Very Difficult (12+) Pilot check, depending

on local terrain. They can also land on bodies of water. Failing a Pilot check while attempting a landing means the ship has landed improperly or even crashed.

DOCKING Two spacecraft may dock if they are close together and neither ship attempts to resist the docking maneuver. Many airlock designs across charted space are compatible; for incompatible airlocks, ships extend flexible plastic docking tubes that adapt to the target airlock. Docking with another vessel requires a Routine
(6+) Pilot check (1D minutes).

BOARDING Hostile ships may be docked with and boarded, although this is a very dangerous operation at all stages. Boarding attempts are detailed on page 175.

POWER Every spacecraft has a power plant that produces an amount of Power, as listed in its description in the Common Spacecraft chapter. Under normal circumstances, most ships will produce enough Power to run all systems and weapons without any attention needed from the crew. However, some ships may be built underpowered, usually to fulfil specific budgetary or design criteria. Other ships may run into power problems if they receive damage to their power plant
(see Critical Hits on page 168).

A ship needs the following Power points available for each of these listed systems. The spacecraft in the Common Spacecraft chapter have a summary of these systems, which will greatly speed play if Power starts getting low.

Basic Ship Systems: This includes everything a ship needs for day-to-day operations, including artificial gravity, heating, lighting and life support. The amount of Power needed for basic ship systems is equal to 20% of the total tonnage of the hull.

Maneuver Drive: In order to use the maneuver drive, the ship requires an amount of Power equal to 10% of the hull's total tonnage multiplied by the ship's maximum Thrust.

Jump Drive: In order to use the jump drive, the ship requires an amount of Power equal to 10% of the hull's total tonnage multiplied by the ship's maximum jump range. Note that this Power requirement is only needed when the ship actually initiates a jump – at all other times, the jump drive remains inert.

Weapons: The Weapons and Power table summarises the requirements for various spacecraft armaments included in this book.

**Weapons and Power**

System Power Required Beam Laser 4 Missile Rack 0 Particle Beam 8 Pulse Laser 4 Sandcaster 0 Turret 1

**RUNNING OUT OF POWER** So long as a ship's power plant is producing enough Power to run all systems, the spacecraft can operate normally. If, for any reason, the amount of Power available drops below this, the crew need to make some tough decisions, shutting down various systems so they are no longer a drain on the power plant.

The consequences of shutting down various systems are detailed here. See the Space Combat chapter for ways a crew can shut down systems in battle and, potentially, increase the output of the power plant.

Basic Ship Systems: Basic ship systems cover essentials such as life support, the ship's computer and the gravitic systems providing artificial gravity, which are absolutely vital to the continued running of a ship. However, there are many non-essential systems that can be shut down on a temporary basis (the chicken soup dispenser on deck C is unlikely to be needed in battle, for example), which will halve the amount of Power needed for basic ship systems.

**Maneuver Drive:** The maneuver drive can be throttled back or shut off altogether. This will save an amount of Power equal to 10% of the ship's total tonnage multiplied by the Thrust being deducted.

**Jump Drive:** The jump drive does not ordinarily drain any Power until it is used – however, it is when a crisis has developed that has reduced a ship's Power that the crew usually want to jump, so it will be more common for other systems to be shut down in order to allow the jump drive to function!

Weapons and Systems: Individual weapons and systems can be switched off on a temporary basis, regaining the amount of Power listed on the Weapons and Systems table.

RUNNING COSTS

AND MAINTENANCE A starship operator faces many costs every four weeks, which must be paid in order to carry on flying. This four week 'block' is often known as a Maintenance Period.

Commercial starships usually make two jumps per Maintenance Period. They spend one week in jump, followed by one week in the star system, travelling from the jump point to the local world, refuelling, marketing cargo, finding passengers, leaving the starport and proceeding to a jump point again. The week in the system usually provides some time for crew recreation and exploring the planet.

SKIPPING ON DEBTS Ship captains hoping to avoid crippling repayments on multi-million Credit loans may be tempted to skip out on repayments, jumping to distant systems to make a new life for themselves. If the Travellers do so, they may be chased by ship tracers (bounty hunters) employed by the bank or logged as criminals in the Imperial database and hunted down by naval vessels. For each new system, roll 2D and apply the modifiers here. If the result is an 8+, the Travellers will be hunted for their crimes.

Per parsec distant: -1, reset every time the Travellers are discovered Changes to the ship (repainting, altering transponders, refits and so on): -1 to -6 Per MCr10 of value of ship stolen: +1 If the Travellers have visited this system more than once in the past three months: +2 Payment is less than four weeks overdue: -4 Payment is 4–24 weeks overdue: +4 Payment is 25 weeks to one year overdue: +2 Payment is more than one year overdue: +0 Add local Law Level -5

Non-commercial ships usually follow the same schedule of one week in jump and one week in a system. If haste is called for, a ship may refuel at a gas giant immediately and re-jump right away. This allows the ship to make one jump per week but makes no provision for cargo, passengers or local stops.

Mortgage or Debts: If the crew are paying off debts on their spacecraft, then these must be paid every Maintenance Period.

Life Support and Supplies: Each stateroom on a ship costs Cr1000 every Maintenance Period. This cost covers supplies for the life support system as well as food and water, although meals at this level will be rather spartan.

Each person on board a ship who is not in a low berth will cost an additional Cr1000 every Maintenance Period in life support costs.

Each occupied low berth costs Cr100 every Maintenance Period.

Fuel: Fuel costs Cr500 per ton for refined fuel or Cr100 per ton for unrefined fuel. Fuel is required for both the jump drive and power plant.

Repairs and Maintenance: A ship needs maintenance, which costs 0.1% of the total purchase price of the ship per year. Maintenance should be carried out every Maintenance Period (divide the year's maintenance cost by 12 to find the Maintenance Period cost. Once per year this should be performed at a shipyard.

If maintenance is skipped or skimped on, roll 2D every subsequent Maintenance Period, with a DM equal to the number of Maintenance Periods skipped. On 8+, the ship suffers a critical hit. Roll 2D on the Poor Maintenance table and apply the effects.

To repair this damage, see page 159.

Crew Salaries: Salaries for hired crew members must be paid every Maintenance Period.

Berthing Costs: Landing at a starport incurs a weekly cost, which varies wildly from world to world. See Starports on page 257.

Poor Maintenance 2D Critical Hit Effect 2–4 Fuel Leak The spacecraft loses 1D x 10% of its fuel capacity. 5–7 Drive Damaged Roll 1D. On 1–3, the maneuver drive is hit; reduce Thrust by -1 and all Pilot checks suffer DM-1. On 4–6, the jump drive is hit and disabled – it may not be used until repaired. 8–9 Weapon Faulty One random turret (or weapon, if no turrets are present) is damaged DM-1 on all attack rolls made with it. 10–12 Power Plant The spacecraft's Power is reduced by 25% and it takes 1D extra damage, ignoring armor. All crew suffer 2D x 10 rads per week.

Running Cost Summary Item Maintenance Period Cost Mortgage Varies on ship Life Support Cr1000 per stateroom, Cr100 per low berth, Cr1000 per person Fuel Cr500 per refined ton, Cr100 per unrefined ton Repairs and Maintenance 0.1% of purchase price, divided by 12 Salary: Pilot Cr6000 Salary: Astrogator Cr5000 Salary: Engineer Cr4000 Salary: Steward Cr2000 Salary: Medic Cr3000 Salary: Gunner Cr1000 Salary: Marine Cr1000

ENCOUNTERS Space is unimaginably vast – on a galactic scale, stars are little wisps of hydrogen and gas giants are just specks of matter. If ships travelled through the whole of the space in a system, they would never encounter each other. However, spacecraft tend to flock to just a few places in any given system, such as the 100-diameter jump limit of colonized worlds, industrial belts in orbit, and gas giants and settled moons. Outside of these regions, the chance of an encounter is negligible.

To generate a random encounter, roll 1D every day. On a 6, the ship has encountered something – roll D66
(see page 5) on the Space Encounters table, applying the following DMs to the first dice rolled on the D66 only (thus, Settled Space has a range of 21–76 and Wild Space has a range of 01–56).

Highport (DM+3): The space near an orbital starport High-Traffic Space (DM+2): The space near an industrial world with a high-class starport. Settled Space (DM+1): Most core worlds in settled or colonized space. Border Systems (DM+0): Outlying worlds near the border, such as the Spinward Marches. Wild Space (DM-1): Amber or Red Zone worlds. Empty Space (DM-4): Untravelled space or unexplored systems.

Encounters in bold cannot be ignored – they are potentially hostile ships or encounters that will force the Travellers to respond.

The encounter distance depends on the results of an Electronics (sensors) check. Civilian vessels and military craft not on maneuvers broadcast a continuous IFF beacon, which gives DM+4 to detection attempts. See Sensors on page 160.

Collisions, signals and solar flares are exempt from encounter distance rules.

Collision!: Almost any collision at high speed is lethal even for the most powerful spacecraft. In this case, the ship has collided with a tiny object that has nevertheless smashed into the hull. The ship suffers 1D damage.

Distress Signals: Ships transmit the standard time- stamped SOS message (also known as Mayday in Solomani or Signal GK in Vilani within the Third Imperium setting) when in distress. Any vessel who detects an SOS is legally required to respond and offer assistance or contact the authorities. Failure to render assistance is a criminal offence but the harsh requirements of life support and orbital mechanics mean that many deaths in space are slow ones, where a crew know they are doomed but have days or weeks in which to contemplate it. Many ships carry low berths where the crew can freeze themselves and wait for rescue.

Some distress calls are fakes, intended to draw ships in so they can be attacked.

Police Vessel: This result may also indicate a military vessel or government ship. A police vessel will aid the Travellers if they are attacked but will also challenge them to identify themselves and scan for contraband cargo.

Pirate: Pirates operate in three ways, all aimed at avoiding contact with the authorities at a spaceport
(except in lawless systems where pirates operate with impunity). Some ambush ships travelling through normal space to outlying moons and colony worlds. Others lurk around the 100-diameter mark, hoping to surprise a ship as it prepares to jump. The pirates then quickly loot the most valuable cargo and supplies, and jump before the authorities arrive. The third category of pirates have agents and spies in the starport and know exactly which ships are suitable targets.

Pirates often use armed free traders or even scout/couriers.

Salvage: A derelict vessel or jettisoned cargo can be salvaged. Universal law in space permits salvage but the discovery must be registered first with the system starport, if any. Roll 2D on the Salvage table, applying DM-0 to -6 depending on how damaged the derelict is. If the result is an 8+, then D3 times on the Salvage table.

Note that pirates have been known to use derelicts as bait...

FUEL Most ships use refined hydrogen as fuel for their fusion power plants engines and jump drives. Starports (see page 257) and virtually any other facility that regularly hosts spacecraft will offer refuelling facilities. Hydrogen is obtained from water or the atmospheres of gas giants and costs Cr500 per ton for refined fuel.

Some out-of-the-way places only offer unrefined fuel, at the bargain price of just Cr100 per ton. Using unrefined fuel is dangerous when jumping (see Jump Travel).

Either way, it typically takes 1D hours to refuel a typical ship.

Salvage 2D Salvage 2D Salvage

| 12 | Ship: The ship is potentially repairable. |

A ship with fuel scoops may gather fuel from bodies of water using hoses. It may also scoop hydrogen from a gas giant, requiring a Difficult (10+) Pilot check (1D hours, DEX). Fuel gathered in the wild is unrefined but a ship with fuel processors may refine it. More notes on fuel scooping are covered in the Traveller Companion.

JUMP TRAVEL Jump travel covers the method by which ships can travel the enormous distances needed to journey to other star systems with relative speed. Other methods of star travel are covered in High Guard.

Jump travel is the only known means by which a vessel may travel faster than light. To jump, a ship creates a bubble of hyperspace by means of injecting high- energy exotic particles into an artificial singularity. The singularity is driven out of our universe, creating a tiny parallel universe that is then blown up like a balloon by injecting hydrogen into it. The jump bubble is folded around the ship, carrying it into the little pocket universe.

This new universe is short-lived and will eventually collapse, precipitating the ship back into normal space several light-years from its original position.

A ship can only safely jump when it is more than 100 diameters distant from any object larger than the ship. A vessel could only jump away from Earth, for example, when it is more than 1.27 million kilometers distant (as well as 140 million kilometers away from Sol and 300,000 kilometers away from the Moon). Gravity can cause a jump bubble to collapse prematurely, bringing a ship back into normal space early – so, if a ship tried to jump from Earth to Mars when the Sun was between the two, the vessel would fall out of jump space as soon as it came within 100 diameters of the Sun.

**PREPARING FOR JUMP** To jump, the following procedures must be performed as a task chain using Astrogation and Engineer
(j-drive) checks.

**Astrogation:** The jump needs to be plotted. This is an Easy (4+) Astrogation check (1D x 10 minutes, EDU), modified by the jump distance (thus, a jump covering four parsecs gives DM-4 to the check). If the check is failed, then the astrogator must plot the jump again. Astrogation can be done in advance (a jump is normally plotted while the ship is travelling out to the 100-diameter distance).

Jump!: Firing the jump drive requires an Easy (4+) Engineer (j-drive) check (1D x 10 minutes, EDU), modified by the task chain of the original Astrogation check and the following modifiers.

•  Jump drive not maintained: DM-1 per month behind maintenance
•  Using unrefined fuel: DM-2
•  Still within the 100-diameter limit: DM-4

If this check is failed, then the ship misjumps.

Divert Power: A jump drive requires a tremendous amount of power to function, which must be supplied by the ship's power plant. On many vessels, especially older ships, the power plant strains to provide this much, leading to the tradition of 'jump dimming' where non-essential systems including lighting is shut down to allow for jump. If insufficient Power is available, the jump drive cannot be activated.

JUMP TRAVEL When making a jump, a ship will use an amount of fuel equal to 10% of its hull tonnage for every parsec jumped. For example, if a 200-ton ship makes a two parsec jump, it will require 40 tons of fuel (10% of 200 tons = 20, multiplied by two parsecs = 40 tons).

A jump carries the vessel a number of parsecs equal to the jump number. Jumps of less than one parsec
(less than three light years or one hex on a sector map) are possible and count as jump-1 for the purposes of Astrogation checks and fuel expenditure. Regardless of how far the ship jumps, it always stays in jumpspace for roughly one week (148 + 6D hours).

While in jumpspace, the ship is completely and utterly cut off from the universe. It hangs in a shimmering bubble of boiling hydrogen, a pocket dimension from which nothing can escape. It cannot communicate with the normal universe, not even by psionic means. It is utterly alone.

When the ship exits jumpspace after an accurate jump, it tends to arrive close to the target world but outside or on the verge of the 100-diameter limit. Inaccurate jumps dump the ship somewhere in the inner system, requiring a long space flight.

MISJUMPS On rare occasions, normally because of a lack of maintenance or using unrefined fuel, a ship can misjump. Many misjumps are lethal, causing the jump bubble to collapse early or for time in the bubble to flow

differently, so that trillions of subjective years pass inside the bubble and all that comes out the other end is hard radiation caused by protons exceeding their half-life.

If the Engineer (j-drive) check made to initiate a jump is failed by an Effect of -1, the ship will arrive in the target system but appear 1D days later than normal. At the referee's option, roll an additional 1D – this is the number of extra days the ship spends in jumpspace from the point of view of the crew (the relativity error generated by this misjump causes a difference in perceived time aboard the ship and the rest of the universe).

If the Engineer (j-drive) check made to initiate a jump is failed by an Effect of -2, the ship will arrive in the target system but find itself a number of 100-diameters away from the intended world multiplied by 1D.

If a worse Effect is rolled, a merciful referee may wish to subject the Travellers to the most survivable form of misjump, where the ship ends up 1D x 1D parsecs in a random direction, potentially in deep (and empty) space.

PASSENGERS Passenger travel within the Imperium has been standardised into five overarching categories; High, Middle, Basic, Working and Low. It is assumed that the ship will take between one and three weeks to deliver the passenger to its destination (allowing enough time to fly out, jump for a week, then travel to the destination world).

The process of finding paying passengers is detailed in the Trade chapter. However, ship captains hoping to turn a profit when transporting passengers should be aware of the following:

High Passage: The passenger gets the best possible treatment. The passenger receives a stateroom and one ton of cargo space for baggage and can expect high-quality entertainment. One level of the Steward skill is required for every 10 high passengers.

Middle Passage: Middle passage is generally sold on a stand-by basis so middle passengers can be
'bumped' by high passengers who arrive later – many ships will only take middle passengers if they cannot fill staterooms with high passage clients or lack enough stewards. Baggage allowance is 100kg. One level of the Steward skill is required for every 100 middle passengers. A Traveller with Steward 0 can provide suitable services for 10 middle passengers.

Basic Passage: Also called steerage, this is where a ship's captain tries to fill all available space with low-paying passengers. It is generally considered more trouble than it is worth but there is nearly always someone desperate enough to use basic passage. Two basic passengers can be crammed into one stateroom and other areas of the ship can be kitted out with simple bunks to carry more – two tons of space is required for every basic passenger not in a stateroom. Baggage allowance is 10kg.

Working Passage: This is identical to middle passage but the passenger pays their way by serving on board ship in some capacity, usually fulfilling one of the crew positions.

Low Passage: A low passenger is frozen in a low berth and counts as cargo. There is real danger to the passenger, as a Routine (6+) Medic check (1D x 10 minutes, INT) is required upon opening the capsule, applying the passenger's END DM to the check.

A further DM+1 is applied if the ship is TL12 or higher, while non-humans suffer DM-2. An emergency low berth inflicts DM-1 on this check.

If the check failed, the passenger does not survive.

It is customary for the ship's captain to contribute Cr10 from every low passage towards a lottery in which each low passenger randomly guesses how many will survive the trip. If the winner is among the dead, the captain collects the prize. The lottery is administered by a ship's steward.

REMOTE OPERATIONS Some ships carry a variety of drones to enable their crew to perform tasks without leaving their ship or manoeuvring their vessel into hostile territory. Drones are piloted from their mother ship with the Electronics
(remote ops) skill and can operate at up to Medium range (see page 165).

Drones are typically man-sized and have gravitic drives that allow them to operate in both space and atmospheres. However, while they can land on a planet, they do not have the power to travel from the surface to orbit and must be recovered manually.

Some of the ships in the Common Spacecraft chapter carry the drones detailed here. High Guard contains more drones along with details on how they may be used with any ship.

**MINING DRONES** Mining drones allow a ship to mine asteroids without manoeuvring perilously close to spinning hunks of rock. Each set of mining drones allows the ship to process 1D x 10 tons of asteroid per day (typically producing common ore). The presence of drones includes ore handling machinery, allowing the ship to take on ore and transfer it to the cargo bay.

**PROBE DRONES** Probe drones are for surveying planetary surfaces and are commonly found on board scout ships. They can be dropped from orbit in disposable entry shells but must be recovered manually. Probe drones are also capable of surveying orbiting satellites, derelicts and other space debris and can also be used as communications relays.

**REPAIR DRONES** Carrying repair drones allows a ship to make repairs during combat, allowing access to exterior components without risking crew. They also have sufficient intelligence to allow repairs to be initiated by a drone controller rather than a dedicated engineer.

Repair drones allows a Traveller with the Electronics
(remote ops) skill to use the Repair System action (see page 172). The repair drones are considered to have an Engineer skill level of 1 or the level the Traveller has in Electronics (remote ops), whichever is lower, in all specialities for the Repair System action alone.

Critical Hit Repair Engineer or Mechanic Effect Spare Parts Required
| 1 | 1 ton |
| 2 | 0.8 tons |
| 3 | 0.6 tons |
| 4 | 0.4 tons |
| 5 | 0.2 tons |
| 6 | None |

REPAIRS Damage to a ship falls into two categories – hull damage and critical hits. See the Space Combat chapter for how both are applied to a ship.

Critical Hit: A critical hit can be jury-rigged back to use
(see page 172) but will stop functioning again after 1D hours. Properly repairing a critical hit requires not only an Engineer or Mechanic check (1D hours) but also spare parts. The Effect of the check determines how many spare parts are required, minus the Severity of the critical hit. Spare parts can be purchased at the cost of Cr100000 per ton and capable captains will always ensure they carry some in reserve. A destroyed weapon or item of equipment will need to be completely replaced, and cannot be repaired using spare parts.

Hull Damage: Each lost Hull point can be replaced with a Routine (6+) Mechanic check (1 hour, INT or EDU), consuming one ton of spare parts.

SENSORS All spacecraft have advanced sensors that allow them to spot potential threats and items of interest from possibly thousands of kilometers distant. They have limited automatic operation but, as always, it requires a human present to actually interpret the information in a useful way.

Under normal circumstances, an Electronics (sensors) check is all that is required to detect and identify a target that has moved into range of sensors. What information can be determined from this depends on the type of sensors employed.

The kind of sensors a ship possesses depends on the sensor package installed. Distances between ships and other objects in space is determined by range bands, as shown on the Range Bands table.

Once the range has been determined, consult the Sensor Target and Sensor Detail tables to determine what information can be gleaned on the target from the sensors on board.

Range Bands Range Band Distance Adjacent 1km or less Close 1–10km Short 11–1,250km Medium 1,251–10,000km Long 10,001–25,000km Very Long 25,001–50,000km Distant More than 50,000km

SENSOR TYPES The following are the types of sensor commonly found on spacecraft across Tech Levels.

Visual (all): Electronically-enhanced telescopes. Thermal (all): Picking up heat emissions. EM (all): Sensors detecting emissions across the electromagnetic spectrum from low-frequency radio waves to gamma rays. Radar/Lidar (all): Detects physical objects. Active use bounces beams off a target and thus makes it easier to be seen (DM+2 to Electronics (sensors) checks to be detected in return). NAS (advanced): Neural Activity Scanner. Detects neural activity and intelligence. Densitometers (improved): Determines internal structure and makeup of an object through its natural gravity.

SHIP COMPUTERS The computers installed on board ships to run their systems are a great deal more powerful than those commonly used planetside.

**SPECIALISED COMPUTERS** Some ships, such as the Type-S scout, have very specialized computers that allow them to run jump software beyond their normal Processing score. These are noted as /bis computers (such as the computer/5bis installed within the Type-S) and can run Jump Control software as if their Rating was +5 higher.

A Model 1/bis computer (normal Processing 5 but Processing 10 for Jump Control software) can therefore run Jump Control/2 (requiring Processing 10).

**SHIP SOFTWARE** Ship software operates in exactly the same way as normal computer software but typically has a much higher bandwidth. Ship computers are fully capable of running normal software as well.

SPACECRAFT SECURITY Hijacking is one of the biggest threats faced by independent traders, especially those that carry passengers or travel to dangerous space. As the Travellers will likely face this threat (or be this threat at some point), it is worth looking at in some detail.

CAMERAS & SENSORS Most vessels have security cameras in public areas, such as the galley, cargo bay and lounge but not in private staterooms (although these can be added). Cameras can be viewed from any terminal by an authorized person. Internal sensors on a ship are limited to environmental detectors like smoke alarms and most ships are not calibrated to, say, detect heat traces or life signs within their own hull. It is possible to detect when a door is opened or closed, although these sensors can easily be disabled.

COMPUTERS The difficulty to hack into a ship's computer depends on what is being accessed and from where. Few ships require anything less than Very Difficult (12+) Electronics (computers) checks to access critical systems from outside the ship but often the security system will apply only to these external connections and a hacker inside the ship will only face Average (8+) Electronics (computers) checks.

**Ship Software**

The computer reacts automatically to incoming fire, applying a negative DM equal to the Evade program's score to all attacks.

Fire Control/1 Fire Control/2 Fire Control/3 Fire Control/4 Fire Control/5

Allows the computer to fire a number of turrets per round equal to the listed number. Alternatively, it can give a positive DM to an attack equal to the listed number or any combination of the two. For example, a ship with Fire Control/2 could make two automated attacks, grant DM+2 to a gunner making an attack or make one automated attack with DM+1. Auto-Repair/1 Auto-Repair/2

Allows the computer to make a number of repair attempts per round equal to the listed number. Alternatively, it can give a positive DM to a repair attempt equal to the listed number or any combination of the two. Requires the ship to carry repair drones. Library 8 0 Included Contains a wealth of data on numerous subjects.

Gaining access to the ship's records requires an Average (8+) Electronics (computers) check. Convincing the computer you are a member of the crew is Difficult (10+). Overriding security systems is Very Difficult (12+) and gaining control of key systems like navigation or power is Formidable (14+).

Note that Security software (see page 110) can be installed on a ship's computer to make a hacker's job even harder.

LOCKS Doors, airlocks, lockers and other secure panels are locked. In general, external locks are tougher than internal ones (increasing the difficulty by one level). Locks used on spacecraft are generally electronic but other types are possible.

Mechanical: Requiring a key or combination. These can be opened with an Average (8+) Mechanics check or by stealing a key/learning the combination. Electronic: Requiring a keycard or combination. These can be opened with a Difficult (10+) Electronics (computers) check or by stealing a key/ learning the combination. Biometric: Requiring a voiceprint, DNA test, palm print or retina scan. These can be opened with a Very Difficult (12+) Electronics (computers) check or by stealing a sample from an authorized person. Intelligent: Intelligent locks recognise authorized crew. These can be opened with a Very Difficult (12+) Electronics (computers) check or by hacking the ship's computer.

Any non-mechanical lock can be opened or closed remotely if the crew wishes to allow this option (but then the doors can also be hacked). Bulkhead doors
(also called iris valves) on a ship are airtight but others, such as those leading to staterooms, are not.

SECURITY SYSTEMS If a ship finds itself the target of hijacking or boarding, there are several security systems common to all vessels that can be employed by the crew.

Alarms: If an alarm is tripped (hull breach, fire, door being forced open, alarm button pressed), it will alert the crew. The location of the alarm will be shown on computer displays. A passenger ship may have several crew trained in combat; military ships will carry dedicated marines. Some vessels may even have security robots who respond automatically to alarms. Gravity: It is possible to alter the artificial gravity on board. Reducing gravity to zero will limit actions to

the level of an attacker's Athletics (dexterity) skill (see Zero Gravity on page 81). Gravity can also safely be increased up to 3G with an Electronics (computers) check, which will count as high gravity (see page 80). Tranq Gas: Some ships carry tranq gas canisters in the air vents, which can be released automatically. These flood a compartment with gas that forces END checks, with a cumulative DM-1 every round. Any Traveller who fails the END check is knocked unconscious for 2D minutes. Venting Atmosphere : If a compartment is connected to an airlock, then the air can be vented from that area. Travellers in that area must make a STR check to hang on and not be blown out into space and will also begin to suffocate.

TRAVEL TIMES Spacecraft are extremely fast – however, space is very large and even with all their advanced technology, it still takes a long time to reach destinations. Worlds orbiting the same star are accessible by interplanetary travel, on ships operated by local entrepreneurs or with a variety of small craft.

Interplanetary travel takes time. The travel formulae can determine time required (if distance and acceleration are known), acceleration required (if distance and time are known) and distance travelled (if time and acceleration are known). All of these formulae use meters and seconds and assume the ship is undertaking a journey from rest, that it accelerates continuously to midpoint of the trip, then decelerates to rest again. 1G is equal to approximately 10 meters per second per second.

TRAVEL CALCULATIONS The following calculations can be used to work out specific travel times if required – you are going to need a calculator for this!

Time Required: Time = 2 x Square Root of
(Distance/Acceleration) Acceleration Required: Acceleration = (Distance x 4)/Time^2 Distance Travelled: Distance = (Acceleration x Time^2 )/4

While some of you may be very comfortable with such formulae, we know others will not be and so many useful distances are summarized on the Transit Times table.

# SPACE COMBAT

Clashes between spacecraft in Traveller can involve small, faster craft, zipping between asteroids as they snap laser blasts off at one another or battles taking place over distances of thousands of kilometers, sometimes over long hours. These battles are slow, calculated affairs, with spears of brilliant light lancing out into the darkness across relativistic distances, aimed at where the enemy is predicted to be.

The former type of battle takes place at short range, often close enough for crews to visually sight their enemy through a viewport. This kind of close ranged
'knife fight' uses rules very similar to those used between vehicles and is summarized on page 138. It can be likened to swirling aerial dogfights where pilots are flying by the seat of their pants in order to get a shot at the enemy.

Most space combat, however, will take place at ranges far beyond the visual, where distances are so great that even weapons that function at the speed of light have to adjust for relative motion. This kind of battle can be likened to submarine warfare, where decisions have to be weighed and the environment is both methodical and claustrophobic.

COMBAT ROUNDS Combat between spacecraft is similar to that between Travellers or vehicles but uses a six minute combat round (rather than six seconds). Each Traveller on board can take up a particular position or duty on board, such as pilot, gunner or engineer. In each round, every Traveller will have the opportunity to perform actions or move between positions.

When spacecraft are involved in combat against Travellers or vehicles directly or against other spacecraft at Close range (10km or less) use the Dogfighting rules on page 174.

COMBAT STEPS When spacecraft fight, instead of one ship completing all of its actions before you move onto the next, as happens in combat between Travellers and vehicles, you instead go through the following steps in every combat round.

**1. Maneuver Step:** In order of Initiative, each ship maneuvers based on its Thrust.
**2. Attack Step:** In order of Initiative, each ship can attack, using weapons or conducting boarding actions.
**3. Actions Step:** In order of Initiative, ships can perform other, miscellaneous actions, such as repairing damaged systems, jumping out of the system or launching craft.

Once the Actions Step is complete, the combat round ends and if there are still ships fighting, a new combat round begins with the Maneuver Step.

CREW DUTIES Every Traveller on board a ship who intends to take part in a battle must be assigned to one of the following duties. There can only be one pilot and one captain but other duties may have multiple Travellers performing them and Travellers can move between different duties during the battle.

Pilot: Flies the ship, responsible for changing course and making evasive maneuvers. Captain: Commands the ship and can use Leadership and Tactics skills. Engineer: Engineers can be assigned to the power plant and maneuver and jump drives, or handle general damage control. Sensor Operator: This position engages in electronic warfare and keeps track of enemy spacecraft. Turret Gunner: Each turret has its own gunner. A Traveller must choose which turret they are controlling at the start of the combat. Bay Gunner: Each bay weapon has its own gunner. Marine: Prepares to repel boarders or to board enemy ships. Passenger: Passengers are all Travellers who are not assigned a duty and are assumed to be waiting in their staterooms.

A list of possible actions related to each duty can be found on page 171.

AUTOMATED DUTIES A ship's computer can cover several duties if it is running the appropriate software.

•  Fire Control programs can either act as gunners or assist gunners.
•  A ship equipped with repair drones and Auto-Repair software can perform damage control.
•  A ship running an Intellect program and Expert
(engineer – j-drive, m-drive or power) can act as an engineer.
•  A ship running an Intellect program and Expert
(pilot) can act as the pilot.
•  A ship running an Intellect program and Expert
(electronics - sensors) can act as a sensor operator.

STARTING A BATTLE Before a battle begins, it is important to note where ships are relative to one another. In general, all that is required in space is to know how far away each ship is from its opponents. This is determined by using Range Bands, as described in the Combat chapter, although the actual distance for each Range Band is much greater in space combat. Consult the Range Bands table for reference.

Range Bands

Range Band Distance Adjacent 1km or less Close 1–10km Short 11–1,250km Medium 1,251–10,000km Long 10,001–25,000km Very Long 25,001–50,000km Distant More than 50,000km

Most hostile encounters in space will start at Very Long or Distant ranges, when the combatants first detect one another. However, actual combat will start when one of the combatants manages to move into range of their weapons, typically Long or Medium range. However, in some circumstances ships might get a lot closer before hostilities begin, perhaps getting as near as Close range if a pirate successfully pretends to be an honest merchant, for example.

INITIATIVE Once the relative positions of ships have been determined and crew assigned to duties, the battle begins. Initiative is rolled once for each ship as usual when the combat begins but with spacecraft you roll the following:

2D + the pilot's Pilot skill + the ship's Thrust score

Ships with better pilots and faster maneuver drives will therefore be quicker to act in space combat.

FACING AND FIRE ARCS Most spacecraft are manoeuvrable enough to spin or rotate to face their enemies in combat and have weapons mounted in turrets with very wide fire arcs so, generally speaking, it is not important to track which way a spacecraft is facing as it is with vehicles. However, some spacecraft, particularly small craft such as fighters, have fixed weapon mounts and must actually point towards the target they are engaging. In this instance, it can be important to keep track of where a spacecraft is pointing.

TACTICS (NAVAL) SKILL In addition, the commander of each spacecraft (or the commander of a fleet, if more than one ship is present) may make a Tactics (naval) check at the start of a battle. The Effect of this check is added to the Initiative of the spacecraft (or fleet).

SURPRISE Under normal circumstances, surprise is very difficult to achieve in space, as there are few places to hide behind. However, damaged sensors or inattentive sensor operators can mean a ship can approach another without being spotted and some ships may use asteroids or other astronomical objects to hide behind, while others may pretend to be harmless and then suddenly reveal their intentions.

If one ship does manage to surprise another, its opponent will not be able to take any actions in the first round of the combat.

MANEUVER STEP In order of Initiative, each ship can allocate Thrust to either movement (closing or increasing the range between it and another ship) or combat manoeuvring
(docking with another vessel, lining up a shot or dodging incoming fire).

All movement and combat manoeuvring is performed by the Traveller assigned to pilot duty.

MOVEMENT The amount of Thrust required to increase or decrease the Range Band between ships by one category, up or down, is shown on the Ship Movement table – the Thrust listed is the amount required to move from that Range Band to either the next closest or next furthest. A ship can spend Thrust over multiple rounds to close or open a category.

If two ships are travelling towards one another, then the proportion of their Thrusts devoted to movement are added together for the purposes of Range Band changes. If one ship is trying to escape another, then subtract the lower Thrust from the higher to work out the Range Band change – the faster ship will either gain on or pull away from the slower.

As will be readily apparent, it takes a lot of Thrust to move between Range Bands once ships get to Long range or further. This is because space is vast and even the most powerful ships take a long time to cross any significant distance. At these ranges, ships will rarely expend vital energy trying to change range unless they are looking to board a target or escape.

Note that once a spacecraft moves to within Close or Adjacent range of another, immediately start using the Dogfighting rules on page 174.

COMBAT MANOEUVRING Any remaining Thrust that has not been allocated for movement may be used for combat manoeuvring.

One point of Thrust allows a ship to do one of the following, and several of these maneuvers may be attempted if enough Thrust is available. However, each maneuver may only be attempted once with the exception of Evasive Action.

Aid Gunners: A pilot may attempt to aid thair gunners by providing a more stable firing platform along the optimum attack vector. The pilot makes a Pilot check to start a task chain with their gunners, as described on page 63.

Ship Movement Range Band Distance Thrust Required Example Adjacent 1km or less 1 Docked ships Close 1–10km 1 Nearby or dogfighting vessels Short 11–1,250km 2 Ships in same orbital path Medium 1,251–10,000km 5 Surface to orbit Long 10,001–25,000km 10 Near to a planet Very Long 25,001–50,000km 25 Within jump limit Distant More than 50,000km 50 Distant ships

Docking: The pilot must make a successful Pilot check. If the other ship does not wish to be docked, then both ships must make opposed Pilot checks, with the ship trying to dock suffering DM-2. When a docking is successful, boarding actions can take place.

Evasive Action: Any remaining Thrust can be used as a reaction to dodge incoming fire. This is covered on page 171.

ATTACK STEP Once all ships have worked out their movement and combat manoeuvring, they can launch attacks! This is done in Initiative order.

Attacking with weapons mounted on spacecraft uses the same rules as detailed in the Combat chapter, with the following exceptions:

•  Firing a spacecraft-mounted weapon uses the Gunner skill.
•  The maximum Range of weapons is noted in Range Bands, not meters.

Weapons on board a spacecraft are fired by Travellers assigned to gunner duty. However, a pilot may fire any weapons in a single turret at DM-2 to the attack roll or weapons noted as being in fixed mounts (this is usually found on smaller craft that are not always large enough to accommodate turrets, such as fighters and shuttles).

FIRING WEAPONS When a ship fires at another, it declares it is going to attack and selects a target. The target may then choose to perform Evasive Action. The Traveller on gunner duty for the weapon being fired then makes an appropriate skill check and, as normal for any skill check, if they total 8+, the attack is successful and damage is dealt to the target (see Damaging Spacecraft on page 168).

The standard skill check used when making an attack from a spacecraft is as follows.

2D + Gunner (appropriate speciality) + DEX DM

**COMMON MODIFIERS TO SPACECRAFT ATTACKS** The following modifiers are commonly used to influence Gunner checks when attacking.

Bonuses Penalties Short Range +1 Long Range -2 Using a Pulse Laser

+2 Very Long Range -4

Using a Beam Laser

+4 Distant Range -6

For every full 1,000 tons of the target

+1 (max. DM+6)

**SPACECRAFT DAMAGE SCALE** Spacecraft are larger and able to withstand a great deal more punishment than the average vehicle. They are also capable of mounting much larger weapons.

While spacecraft are theoretically capable of mounting vehicle-type weapons, such as autocannon and howitzers, they may also carry beam lasers, missile racks and other high-energy weapons, all of which are able to vaporise an unlucky Traveller or vehicle in a single shot.

To reflect this, a new scale of damage is used for Spacecraft weapons.

Note that if an ordinary weapon is mounted upon a spacecraft, the weapon still uses the ordinary (or Ground) scale – scale is reflected by the weapon being used, not what it is mounted upon.

Spacecraft scale affect two things. First, it is much easier to hit a spacecraft if you are using a Ground scale weapon (simply because it is that much larger), while it is much more difficult for a Spacecraft weapon to hit a Ground target.

Second, Spacecraft scale weapons cause a lot more damage. When Spacecraft weapons attack a Ground target, they multiply their damage by 10. So, for example, a beam laser that normally does 1D damage at Spacecraft scale will do 1D x 10 when shooting at a Ground target.

The reverse is true as well. A Traveller attacking a Spacecraft with a Ground scale weapon will divide its damage by 10 (as always, rounding down).

This is all summarized in the Damage Scale table.

Damage Scale Ground Weapon

Spacecraft Weapon Attacking a...

DM to hit Damage DM to hit Damage

Ground Target

+0 x1 - 2 x10

Spacecraft Target

+2 /10 +0 x1

Note that the multiplication or division of damage due to scaling is performed after all other modifiers for damage have been applied, including Effect and the Destructive trait.

When attacking a Ground target, Spacecraft weapons can be assumed to have the Blast 10 trait.

SPACECRAFT WEAPONS These are among the more common weapons fitted to spacecraft, whether as defensive systems used to deter pirates or those found on small military ships (the truly awesome weaponry mounted on capital ships can be found in High Guard).

All these weapons are Spacecraft scale and require the Gunner skill. Note that, for Spacecraft scale weapons, maximum ranges are listed in Range Bands and they cannot attack targets that lie beyond their listed Range Band.

Beam Laser: A laser-based weapon that fires a continuous beam, allowing targets to be tracked and hit more easily. However, this does require more power to function and so is shorter ranged and does less damage than a pulse laser.

Missile Rack: Although missile racks require ammunition and the warheads take time to reach distant targets, they can be very powerful weapons and, when a range of warheads is available, extremely versatile too. Missiles use slightly different rules to other spacecraft weapons, which are covered on page

172. Each turret with one or more missile racks holds 12 missiles and costs Cr250000 to refill all 12. It takes one round to reload a missile rack (see page 172).

Highly illegal in most areas of space, adding nuclear warheads to missiles makes them devastatingly powerful, even with reduced blast effects in space. Each turret with one or more missile racks can hold 12 nuclear missiles and costs Cr450000 to refill all 12 if legally purchased.

Particle Barbette: Taking advantage of the increased power efficiencies and space available to a barbette, this is a much larger weapon than those mounted in turrets.

Pulse Laser: Utilising capacitors to discharge its energy in a powerful blasts, the pulse laser is less accurate than its beam-based counterpart but is longer ranged and does more damage.

Sandcaster: Although mounted in turrets and of use against boarders, the sandcaster is primarily a defensive weapon used to protect ships from laser weapons. Each turret with one or more sandcasters holds 20 sand canisters and costs Cr25000 to refill. It takes one round to reload a sandcaster (see page 171).

MOUNTING WEAPONS A spacecraft weapon can be attached to a fixed mount or a turret. Fixed mounts can only be fired directly forward and, where present, are noted in the Common Spacecraft chapter.

Turrets are sometimes fitted to a spacecraft as standard but may be added to any ship that has a hull of 100 tons or more. Every 100 tons of the ship's hull allows one turret to be installed so, for example, a 600 ton ship could have up to six turrets installed.

DOUBLE AND TRIPLE TURRETS Some spacecraft are fitted with double or triple turrets, which allow two or three weapons to be mounted in the same turret. If these weapons are different (a pulse laser, missile rack and sandcaster in the same triple turret, for example), then only one type may be used in a single combat round.

However, if two or more weapons are of the same type, they may be fired together. One attack roll is made for all weapons being fired, but each additional weapon adds +1 per damage dice to the final damage total.

For example, if a triple turret with three pulse lasers is fired, it will only make one attack roll but will deal 2D+4 damage (two additional pulse lasers each adding +1 per damage dice).

Sandcasters can also be linked in this way, granting
+1 to the damage negated by laser attacks for each additional sandcaster beyond the first.

Missiles are handled differently when in double or triple turrets, so do not get the bonus above. See page 172 for missile combat.

DAMAGING SPACECRAFT Once the total amount of damage a weapon is causing has been calculated, applying the Effect of the attack roll to the damage rolled as normal, the Armor of the spacecraft is deducted.

The remaining damage is the total that is removed from the spacecraft's Hull. Once a spacecraft has been reduced to zero Hull, it is wrecked and becomes totally inoperable and is beyond any economic repair
(although see the guidelines for salvage on page 156). Those on board will find themselves without power or life support.

CRITICAL HITS If an attack roll against a spacecraft has an Effect of 6 or higher and it causes damage (rather than just bouncing off armor), a critical hit has been scored – some vital system has been damaged by the attack, reducing the effectiveness of the spacecraft.

If a critical hit has been inflicted upon a spacecraft, roll 2D and then consult the Critical Hits Location table. If a particular location does not apply to this spacecraft, roll again.

The Severity of the critical hit is equal to the Effect of the attack roll minus 5. Consult the Critical Hit Effects table to determine the nature of the critical hit and how it affects the spacecraft. Any extra damage caused by the effects of critical hits ignores the spacecraft's Armor.

If a spacecraft has already sustained a critical hit to a location that receives another, use the Severity of the new critical hit or the original plus one, whichever is higher and immediately apply any new effects. Once a location has reached Severity 6, it cannot suffer any more critical hits. Instead, the spacecraft will receive 6D extra damage every time the location suffers another critical hit.

**SUSTAINED DAMAGE** A spacecraft will also have its components degraded through sustaining constant damage. Every time a spacecraft sustains damage equalling 10% of its starting Hull score, roll 2D and then consult the Critical Hits Location table. The spacecraft will suffer a Severity 1 critical hit to that location

CALLED SHOTS Ships at a range of Short or less may attempt to make called shots with direct-fire weapons (not missiles or torpedoes). The attacker nominates the location they wish to target and then makes an attack roll with DM–2. If the attack is successful and scores a critical hit, the attacker may choose which location is hit.

REACTIONS Just as in other forms of combat, those on board a spacecraft can perform reactions in response to the enemy they are fighting. Reactions can only be performed by Travellers assigned to specific duties, as described below.

**EVASIVE ACTION (PILOT)** The pilot of a spacecraft may dodge incoming attacks, so long as the spacecraft has unspent Thrust after movement and combat manoeuvring.

Each point of unspent Thrust will allow the spacecraft to attempt to dodge one attack. The attack suffers a negative DM equal to the pilot's skill.

**POINT DEFENCE (GUNNER)** Using a turret-mounted laser (beam or pulse), a gunner can destroy incoming missiles. Note that a weapon used for point defence cannot be used to make attacks in the same combat round and vice versa. Point Defence may only be performed against missile salvos
(see page 172) as they are about to make their attack roll against a target – missiles are too small and too fast to be targeted at greater ranges. A gunner may only attempt Point Defence once every round.

The gunner must succeed at a Gunner (turret) check against any missile salvo that is about to make its attack roll against their spacecraft. The Effect of the check will remove that many missiles from the salvo. A turret equipped with two lasers provides DM+1 to this check, while a turret equipped with three lasers will provide DM+2

**DISPERSE SAND (GUNNER)** While cheap and versatile, laser weapons are easily foiled by dispersed particles or sand as it is often called. Sandcasters are designed to create temporary defences against incoming laser attacks.

Using a turret-mounted sandcaster, a gunner can attempt to block laser attacks. The gunner must succeed at a Gunner (turret) check against a laser weapon and, if successful, will add 1D plus the Effect of the check to the ship's armor against that laser attack only. Each Disperse Sand reaction uses one canister of sand.

Sand may also be directed against incoming boarding parties. If the Gunner (turret) check is successful, each target in the boarding party suffers 8D point of damage at Ground scale (so do not multiply it).

ACTIONS STEP Once all ships have resolved their attacks, their crew can perform one action each in the Actions Step. This is done in Initiative order and the actions a crewman can perform are determined by the duty they are assigned to.

IMPROVE INITIATIVE (CAPTAIN) The captain of the spacecraft may perform a Leadership check. The Effect of this check (even if it is negative!) is applied to the Initiative of the spacecraft for the next round only.

JUMP (ENGINEER) See Jump Travel on page 157. Jumping in combat is the same as jumping in normal conditions but the astrogation calculations have to be done in a hurry, raising the difficulty one level on both the Astrogation and Engineer (j-drive) checks to bring the time down to 1D minutes (within one combat round).

OFFLINE SYSTEM (ENGINEER) Specific systems and weapons on board the ship can be powered down to reduce the energy requirement from the power plant, allowing Power to be used for other systems. A successful Engineer (power) check (1 round, EDU) will allow the engineer to shut down any number of systems, freeing up Power for subsequent rounds. It requires another round to bring any of these systems back online.

OVERLOAD DRIVE (ENGINEER) By overloading the maneuver drive, the engineer can lend the ship extra speed and manoeuvrability. A successful Difficult (10+) Engineer (m-drive) check (1 round, INT) will increase the ship's Thrust by +1 during the next round. If the check fails with an Effect of –6 or less, the maneuver drive suffers a critical hit with Severity 1, as detailed on page 168. This check suffers a cumulative DM–2 each time it is attempted after the first. This penalty can be removed by performing maintenance on the drive, a procedure that requires Engineer (m-drive) and 1D hours.

OVERLOAD PLANT (ENGINEER) A favorite of engineers on action vids, the power plant can be overstressed on a temporary basis to provide the ship with more Power. A successful Difficult (10+) Engineer (power) check (1 round, INT) will increase the ship's current Power by +10% during the next round. If the check fails with an Effect of –6 or less, the power plant suffers a critical hit with Severity 1, as detailed on page 168. This check suffers a cumulative DM–2

each time it is attempted after the first. This penalty can be removed by performing maintenance on the power plant, a procedure that requires Engineer (power) and 1D hours.

REPAIR SYSTEM (ENGINEER) A Traveller on engineer duty can attempt to affect a quick repair to the effects of a critical hit. This requires an Average (8+) Engineer check (1 round, INT or EDU) with a negative DM equal to the Severity of the critical hit. A cumulative DM+1 is gained every round the Traveller works on repairing the same critical hit. If the spacecraft receives a critical hit to the same location during this time, the Traveller must start again from the beginning with no positive DM.

Note that only the effects of the critical hit can be repaired and these quick repairs will only last for 1D hours. Any Hull damage or destroyed equipment and weapons cannot be repaired this way and will require the spacecraft to leave combat.

RELOAD TURRET (GUNNER) During prolonged battles, turrets mounted with sandcasters or missile racks may run out of ammunition. A turret may be reloaded by any Traveller with the Gunner skill but it will be unable to make any attacks in that round.

SENSOR LOCK (SENSOR OPERATOR) An improved target lock may be obtained on an enemy spacecraft with a successful Electronics (sensors) check. Attacks made by the spacecraft against this target gain DM+2 until the sensor lock is broken (see Electronic Warfare).

ELECTRONIC WARFARE (SENSOR OPERATOR) A ship's sensor operator may attempt to jam the communications of an enemy by making an opposed Electronics (comms) check against the sensor operator in the target spacecraft. The same process may also be used with the Electronics (sensors) skill to break a sensor lock.

BOARDING ACTION (MARINE) If two ships are at Adjacent range, it is possible to launch a boarding party to storm an enemy ship. Boarding actions are covered on page 175.

REASSIGNMENT (ANY) Any Traveller may elect to change their assigned duty instead of performing any other action. They do nothing else in this round but will have adopted their new duty in the following round.

MISSILE COMBAT Unlike most weapons that travel at or close to the speed of light and so hit enemy ships almost instantly, missiles take time to cross the gulf of space. However, despite this drawback, missiles are capable of doing a great deal of damage when they hit an enemy ship.

LAUNCHING MISSILES Missiles used against targets within Adjacent or Close ranges lose any Smart trait they possess, as there is not enough time for them to obtain a solid lock and take advantage of their advanced guidance systems.

Missiles are launched in salvos. A salvo is all the missiles launched by a ship against a single target in the same combat round. This could be a single missile from a single turret, three from a triple turret with three missile racks or dozens from multiple turrets or bays (see High Guard for more information on weapon bays).

Missile salvos effectively have Thrust 10 and will reach their target a number of combat rounds after they have been fired, as shown on the Missile Flight table.

Missile Flight Range Rounds to Impact Medium and below Immediate Long 1 Very Long 4 Distant 10

Note that while missile salvos can be fired at Distant ranges, the attacking ship must have detected its target before they can be launched. Given the limited information that can be gained from sensors at this range, friendly fire incidents may be common among Travellers who are too trigger happy with their missiles.

If a missile has not reached its target within 10 rounds, it will run out of fuel and become inert.

DETECTING MISSILE LAUNCH Once missiles have been launched at a ship, the target has options to avoid the attack or reduce the number of missiles that reach it. However, in order to do this, the crew must know that missiles are in-bound!

When a ship launches missiles, sensor operators on board other ships may make an immediate Routine (6+) Electronics (sensors) check in order to detect them. If the firing ship has not been detected itself, this becomes an Average (8+) check. DM+1 is applied for every full 10 missiles in the salvo, up to a maximum of DM+6.

Undetected missiles may be picked up by the sensor operator at the start of every combat round with an Average (8+) Electronics (sensors) check.

**COUNTERMEASURES** Combat involving missiles creates a very tense atmosphere. The target spacecraft will likely have detected the launches and its crew will have several anxious minutes to watch the blips on their sensor screens gradually get closer and closer.

Fortunately, the crew need not be idle as they await their destruction as there are several countermeasures that can be taken against incoming missiles.

As missiles can take several rounds to reach their targets, you should keep track of how many missiles remain within each salvo, reducing them as countermeasures take effect.

Electronic Warfare: A Traveller performing sensor operator duties on a spacecraft can use the Electronic Warfare action to destroy or misdirect incoming missiles before they impact their vessel or another ship within Close range.

During the Actions Step, the sensor operator must succeed at a Difficult (10+) Electronics (sensors) check in order to destroy or render inert incoming missiles within a single salvo. The Effect of this check will immediately remove that many missiles from the salvo.

Electronic Warfare may be performed upon a salvo multiple times over several rounds, with the effects being cumulative. However, a salvo may only be subjected to Electronic Warfare once per round, no matter how many sensor operators are available.

Flee: A spacecraft under missile attack may simply turn around and engage its maneuver drive, thrusting away from the missiles by increasing the Range Band between missiles and ship. Missiles are extremely long-ranged weapons and so it is not normally possible to outrange a missile in this way but it can perhaps buy enough time to prolong electronic warfare or make a jump.

Point Defence: Finally, just as a salvo is about to strike, gunners may engage in point defence, as detailed on page 171.

MISSILES AND TARGETS When a missile salvo reaches its target, the missile makes an attack roll as normal in the Attack Step. However, neither the Gunner skill of the Traveller(s) that fired the salvo nor range are used as modifiers. Other modifiers, such as Evasive Action, are used as normal.

Instead, the number of missiles remaining in the salvo greatly affects their chances of making a successful attack. Apply DM+1 to the attack roll for every missile in the salvo.

Note that missiles almost always have the Smart trait
(see page 79). For missiles, use the TL of the missile itself or that of the attacking ship, whichever is greater.

Finally, missiles launched at Distant range expend most of their fuel just reaching their target, leaving little to counter the target's maneuvers. Missile salvos launched at Distant range suffer DM–2 to their attack rolls.

IMPACT If an attack roll for a missile salvo is successful, the target will sustain damage. Roll for damage as if for a single missile and deduct the target's armor as normal but do not apply the Effect of the attack roll. Instead, any damage is multiplied by the Effect of the attack roll but the Effect cannot be higher than the number of remaining missiles in the salvo.

VARIANT MISSILES High Guard introduces different types of missiles that are more accurate, carry more fuel or are faster but these rules suit the missiles included in the Traveller Core Rulebook. If a ship launches different types of missile at the same target in the same round, then all the missiles of each type are counted as a different salvo.

DOGFIGHTING As mentioned at the start of this chapter, spacecraft fighting at ranges of less than 10km or attacking vehicles or Travellers directly, use the normal six second combat round rather than the six minute round normally used for space combat.

Combat is conducted using the dogfighting rules for vehicles. Remember to take into account scaling differences for damage and attack rolls as described on page 167 if vehicles or Travellers are directly involved.

Dogfighting does not cost an action – it is automatic if two hostile vessels wish to interact at a close enough range.

Escaping from a Dogfight requires having greater Thrust than your enemy or for your enemy to be willing to let you leave. If neither of these conditions are true, then your only choice is to win the dogfight!

DOGFIGHTS Battling spacecraft within Close or Adjacent range of one another use these 'dogfight' rules. This is a series of maneuvers whereby the pilot of one ship attempts to gain a position of advantage over another.

Combat rounds in dogfights are six seconds long and follow the normal combat rules as detailed on page

138. The combat steps detailed on page 164 are not used in dogfights.

At the start of every round, the pilots of both spacecraft make opposed Pilot checks, with the following modifiers.

Dogfighting Modifiers Dogfighter Modifier Ship is 50 tons or more -1 Ship is 100 tons or more -2 For every 100 tons more than 100 tons

-1

For every additional enemy in the dogfight after the first

-1

Ship's Thrust +1 per point of Thrust dedicated to dogfighting

A draw means that neither ship may attack the other with fixed weapons. The winner may choose to place their opponent's ship in a fire arc of their choice and may choose which of the opposing ship's fire arcs their own vehicle lies in.

In this way, the winner of a dogfight can ensure all their forward facing weapons can attack their enemy while ensuring they stays out of their opponent's forward facing (and the weapons present there). In addition, the winner of a dogfight gains DM+2 to all their attack rolls for this round while the loser suffers DM–2.

Note that many weapons mounted on spacecraft are in turrets and are able to fire into any facing, meaning that dogfights will normally only force a penalty to the attack rolls of the loser, not remove their ability to fight.

If the dogfight continues into the following combat round, the winner of the previous dogfight applies the difference between that round's opposed Pilot check as a positive DM to this round's opposed check.

DOGFIGHTING VEHICLES The dogfighting rules used for spacecraft are compatible with those used for vehicles and may be used when a spacecraft enters an atmosphere and, perhaps, is forced to engage with jet or grav fighters. However, even relatively nimble space fighters are designed for battle across enormous distances in the void of space and will find themselves at a disadvantage against smaller and more nimble vehicles.

In addition to the dogfighting modifiers listed, spacecraft suffer an additional DM–2 when dogfighting vehicles. In the spacecraft's favor, very powerful engines can counter this, although a typical merchant will be very ponderous in a dogfight.

Spacecraft are capable of any Speed Band listed in the Vehicles chapter and will typically be going at Hypersonic speeds when entering an atmosphere.

DOGFIGHTING AND DISTANT ENEMIES Under normal circumstances, spacecraft involved in dogfights cannot take actions against those at further ranges as their crew are far too focused on more immediate dangers much closer. By the same token, spacecraft outside of a dogfight cannot attack within for fear of hitting a friendly ship (if they do not overly care about that, the referee is welcome to randomise targets).

A dogfight will normally be over long before spacecraft outside it are able to act, as dogfights use six second rounds while space combat usually uses six minute rounds, so resolve the dogfight fully before moving back to space combat rounds.

BOARDING ACTIONS There is little in space combat more exciting and terrifying than a boarding action. Marines launch themselves from a closely manoeuvring ship or dedicated small craft and hurl themselves at an enemy vessel in an attempt to gain entry and pacify the crew. These actions lead to vicious firefights with high- powered weaponry being used in the tight confines of a ship's corridors.

Once two ships are within less than one kilometer of each other (Adjacent range), any marines on board can launch a boarding action during the Actions Step. A boarding action takes 2D rounds to complete, after which its results are decided.

**RESOLVING A BOARDING ACTION** To resolve a boarding action, both sides roll 2D, apply the following modifiers and then the defender deducts their total from that of the attacker. The final score is then compared on the Boarding Actions table.

**Boarding Actions** Superior Armor +1 Superior Weaponry +1 Superior Skills and Tactics +2 Superior Numbers +1 Vastly Superior Numbers +3 Defender has no Marines on duty -2

At their option, the referee may like to continue playing out the boarding action at the Ground scale on any
'fighting continues' result. The attackers will have successfully gained entry to the enemy ship and will now be desperately trying to expand their way out of the beachhead. This will be an opportunity for the Travellers to make their own decisions when fighting the crew of the enemy ship and of what targets they will try to reach.

Boarding Actions Total Result
-7 or less The attackers are soundly defeated. If the attacker's ship is docked with the defender's, the defenders may mount a new boarding action of their own and gain DM+4 on the roll to resolve it.
-4 to -6 The attackers are defeated. The attackers must retreat back to their own ship or space – if they are unable to do so, they are killed or captured.
-1 to -3 Fighting continues. Resolve the boarding again in another 1D rounds but the defender gains DM+2 to their roll. The ship being boarded loses 2D Hull. 0 Fighting continues. Resolve the boarding again in another 1D rounds. 1 to 3 Fighting continues. Resolve the boarding again in another 1D rounds but the attacker gains DM+2 to their roll. The ship being boarded loses 2D Hull. 4 to 6 The boarding action is successful and the ship being boarded suffers 1D damage, ignoring any armor. The attackers may take control of the ship after another 2D rounds of pacification. 7 or more The attackers storm the enemy ship and take control of it immediately.

# SPACECRAFT CONSTRUCTION

The spacecraft construction system detailed in this chapter is your gateway to create your own ships or reverse engineer existing designs, allowing you to populate the spacelanes of your universe with unique craft. These rules will allow you to create the most common sorts of ships likely to appear in a campaign but if you want to try your hand at much larger or more specialized vessels, consult High Guard.

Throughout the design process, you will keep track of two key numbers – the total tonnage of the ship (and how much space each added component consumes) and the total cost. The mathematics required to create a ship are not complex but you may find it handy to have a calculator close by!

CONSTRUCTION TIMES Construction times vary wildly, depending on the size and complexity of the spacecraft and the capabilities of the shipyard. On average, assume that it takes one day per million Credits to build a spacecraft at an average commercial shipyard.

STEP 1: CREATE A HULL The first step in designing a ship is to build its hull – this is the body of the ship, its fuselage.

Decide on the total tonnage of the ship. This will affect the performance of the ship and, ultimately, limit what it can carry and achieve.

A basic hull costs Cr50000 per ton. The ship will have 1 Hull point for every full 2.5 tons of hull.

HULL CONFIGURATION The configuration of a hull dictates its shape which, in turn, affects the capability of the ship. Some ships may be capable of entering atmospheres, for example, while others may be destroyed if they try.

The hull configuration chosen for a ship can often affect its cost as more complex engineering factors must be resolved before it can be built, as shown on the Hull Configuration table. Once chosen for a ship, the hull configuration can never be changed – it is not possible to retrofit a new hull configuration.

Hull Configuration Hull Configuration Streamlined? Hull Points Cost Standard Partial — — Streamlined Yes — +20% Dispersed Structure

No -10% -50%

Streamlined hulls include hulls that are needles, wedges, cones and cylinders in shape. They are designed to enter planetary atmospheres and function in a similar fashion to conventional aircraft.

Starting at TL9, all hulls are self-sealing. A self-sealing hull automatically repairs minor breaches such as micrometeoroid impacts and prevents hull hits causing explosive decompression.

INSTALL ARMOR All hulls provide some protection from celestial hazards but it is possible to add heavier armor for better defence.

All hulls start with armor Protection +0, although this can be improved upon. Dispersed structure ships cannot be given increased armor.

The Hull Armor table shows how much of the hull's tonnage is consumed per point of Protection added, along with its costs. A minimum TL is required for each type of armor and there is a maximum amount that can be attached to a hull – this includes any armor the ship had prior to modification.

HULL CONFIGURATIONS

spacecraft construction

STEP 2: INSTALL DRIVES Once you have your basic hull complete, it is time to start filling it! The first items to add are the engines so the ship is able to move through space. These are divided into maneuver and jump drives. Maneuver drives use gravitic technology that pushes the ship through space – it is these that give a ship its Thrust score. Jump drives are special systems that allow a ship to travel faster-than-light across interstellar distances.

To fit a maneuver drive, consult the Thrust Potential table and decide what Thrust score you want your ship to have. The figure below that Thrust score shows what percentage of the ship's hull the maneuver drive requires.

Maneuver drives are limited by TL, as shown on the table. You cannot select a maneuver or reaction drive with a higher TL than the shipyard that is building it. So, for example, a TL9 shipyard can only install maneuver drives that are a maximum of Thrust 1.

Maneuver drives cost MCr2 per ton.

Jump drives follow a very similar pattern. Select the jump score you wish your ship to have and use the Jump Potential table to find the percentage of the ship's hull that the jump drive will consume, then add 5 tons.

A jump drive must be a minimum of 10 tons.

As with maneuver drives, jump drives are also limited by TL, as shown on the Jump Potential table. You cannot select a jump drive with a higher TL than the shipyard that is building it. So, for example, a TL12 shipyard can only install jump drives that are a maximum of jump-3.

Jump drives cost MCr1.5 per ton.

STEP 3: INSTALL POWER PLANT The heart of a spacecraft is the power plant. Typically fusion-based, the power plant meets all the energy requirements for every system on the ship, from the massive amounts required for jump and maneuver drives to the expresso machine in the captain's stateroom. Ships are typically built with power plants large enough to supply energy to all systems on a ship without interruption, although some cheaper vessels may require weapons and other systems to be off-lined while making a jump, for example.

The Power Plant table illustrates the types of power plant available, how much Power they generate and their cost.

Power Plant Type Power per Ton Cost per Ton Fusion (TL8) 10 MCr0.5 Fusion (TL12) 15 MCr1 Fusion (TL15) 20 MCr2

POWER REQUIREMENTS There are three main requirements a power plant must meet in terms of Power needed by a ship.

Basic Ship Systems: This includes everything a ship needs for day-to-day operations, including artificial gravity, heating, lighting and life support. The amount of Power needed for basic ship systems is equal to 20% of the total tonnage of the hull.

Maneuver Drive: In order to use the maneuver drive, the ship requires an amount of Power equal to 10% of the hull's total tonnage multiplied by the maximum Thrust the drive is capable of.

Jump Drive: In order to use the jump drive, the ship requires an amount of Power equal to 10% of the hull's total tonnage multiplied by the maximum jump number the drive is capable of.

spacecraft construction

It is considered good practice to ensure there is enough Power available to use the basic ships systems and the maneuver drive simultaneously

- being able to use the jump drive at the same time without taking power from other systems is considered a good advantage. You should also note that certain weapons and types of equipment require additional Power, as noted in their descriptions.

STEP 4: INSTALL FUEL TANKS All ships require fuel to function and the total fuel tankage for a ship must be indicated in the design plans. There is no cost associated with space allocated to fuel tanks but their capacity will influence how often the ship must refuel.

JUMP DRIVES The fuel tankage needed for a jump drive is related to the size of the ship and the length of the jump, as follows:

10% of the total tonnage of the ship, multiplied by the maximum jump score of the drive.

The result of this is the number of tons that needs to be dedicated to jump fuel.

POWER PLANTS Power plants require fuel tankage equal to 10% of their size (rounding up, minimum one ton). This provides enough fuel for the power plant for four weeks. This can be extended further by increasing the fuel tankage for the power plant (so, doubling it will provide enough fuel for eight weeks and so on).

STEP 5: INSTALL BRIDGE All ships must have a bridge containing basic controls, communications equipment, avionics, scanners, detectors, sensors and other equipment for proper operation of the ship. The size of the bridge varies depending on the size of the ship and can range from a massive deck with multiple crew positions on a capital ship to a snug single-seat cockpit in a fighter.

The size of bridge required and its cost are shown on the Bridges table.

Bridges Size of Ship Size of Bridge 50 tons or less 3 tons 51–100 tons 6 tons 101–200 tons 10 tons 201–1,000 tons 20 tons 1,001–2,000 tons 40 tons 2,001 tons or more 60 tons

The cost of any bridge is MCr0.5 per 100 tons (or part of) of the ship it is installed within.

COCKPITS Instead of a bridge, ships of 50 tons or less may install a cockpit. This is a self-contained, sealed area that contains a single seat and all controls necessary for the operation of the ship. Cockpits are typically entered via an external hatch or canopy.

A cockpit consumes 1.5 ton of space and costs Cr10000.

A dual cockpit provides space for an additional crew member, such as a sensor operator or dedicated gunner. This consumes 2.5 tons of space and costs Cr15000.

A cockpit is not designed for long term use and only has life support for 24 hours. However, pilots will want to leave the cockpit long before then...

STEP 6: INSTALL COMPUTER Every ship needs a central computer, usually installed near the bridge. The computer is the heart of the ship, controlling all functions from life support to the complex calculations needed to perform a jump.

Computers are identified by their model number and the Computers table indicates their price, capacity and Tech Level. In general, larger and more powerful computers are advantageous in combat. The computers installed in a ship work just like personal computers (see page 110) but are considerably more powerful because the software needed for ship operations requires a great deal of processing power.

Computers do not consume any tonnage on a ship

- while they do have a physical presence, they are distributed throughout the ship and considered part of other components such as the bridge, staterooms and drives.

**Jump Control Specialization (/bis):** A computer's Processing score can be increased by +5 for the purposes of running Jump Control programs only by selecting this option. This increases the computer's cost by +50%.

STEP 7: INSTALL SENSORS All ships come equipped with basic communications, sensor and emission-control suites, usually as part of their bridge. However, specialized or military ships often benefit from more advanced systems that are far more sensitive and resistant to jamming.

The DM column in the Sensors table is applied to all Electronics (comms) and Electronics (sensors) checks made by crew in the ship. All ships have Basic sensors unless upgraded.

STEP 8: INSTALL WEAPONS Military ships rely on a broad range of weaponry to project power across space but even a humble merchant or scout will find a weaponised turret a useful addition when straying into rougher star systems.

Weapons are installed in the same way as components, taking note of the tonnage they consume within the hull and their cost. Most weapons also have a Power cost associated with them and so you should ensure your power plant is still large enough to handle all the needs of the spacecraft after weapons have been installed.

Specific details of weapons and how they are installed in a ship can be found on page 167.

STEP 9: INSTALL OPTIONAL SYSTEMS There are a multitude of optional systems, components and other accessories that can be added to a ship. These are covered on page 184.

Note that most of these optional systems consume tonnage and some also require Power, both of which you should make careful note of.

STEP 10: DETERMINE CREW The Crew Requirements table shows how many crew are needed for a ship. Salary can vary but the values on the Crew Requirements table shows a monthly average for skill level 1 crew, with the presumption that salaries will increase by +50% for every skill level above this.

spacecraft construction

Note that these are the crew levels a ship should have. When Travellers get their hands on a ship, they may want to do things a little differently.

SMALL CRAFT Ships of 100 tons or less that do not possess a jump drive typically have only a single pilot. The journeys undertaken by such ships are generally short and it is assumed regular maintenance will remove any need for mid-voyage engineering.

Specialised small craft, such as those engaged in scientific work or with separate weapon stations may function more efficiently with more crew positions but they are not strictly necessary to the operation of the ship.

SMALL STAR SHIPS Spacecraft in the hands of small-time traders or adventurers usually run with the barest minimum of crew, with personnel often fulfilling more than one role as situations demand. For example, it is very common on a smaller ship for the pilot to also act as the astrogator or a steward to have basic medical skills. This keeps the monthly salary bill low and increases what may otherwise be very slim profits.

Ships of less than 1,000 tons can, in theory, be run by just one or two multi-skilled people but the ship will be at a serious disadvantage in high-stress situations such as combat. The crewman acting as pilot will likely be kept busy in the cockpit, actually flying the ship, while the other will find their attention split between engineering, damage control and the weapon systems – a quick look at the Crew Duties section on page 164 will quickly demonstrate how inefficient this will prove to be.

STEP 11: INSTALL STATEROOMS Staterooms represent the living space for both crew and passengers on ships. A single stateroom contains living and sleeping facilities, including a bed, fresher and a very basic kitchen.

Each stateroom consumes four tons and costs MCr0.5. Most ships will allocate one person to each stateroom.

DOUBLE OCCUPANCY Some ships have bunks in their staterooms rather than single beds, allowing two people to share the same stateroom. This is called double occupancy and is often done on exploratory ships, privately-owned vessels and, especially, military ships.

Employing double occupancy on a ship does not cost anything (which is why many commercial captains insist on it) but lack of privacy for extended periods of time can quickly wear on crew who are not used to it.

LOW BERTHS A low berth provides suspended animation facilities for emergencies and low-paying passengers. They are not always safe to use (see page 158) but take up relatively little space or power.

A low berth can hold one low passenger. It consumes half a ton and costs Cr50000. Low berths require 1 Power for every 10 berths or part of.

COMMON AREAS AND LIVING SPACE It is common practice to assign an additional amount of tonnage, perhaps equal to a quarter of that used for staterooms, as common areas or general living space. These will typically be recreation area such as a mess, canteen or lounge and can provide facilities such as parks, pools, theatres and so on, for the amusement and entertainment of visiting crew and passengers.

1 per 10 High or 100 Middle passengers

spacecraft construction

This is not strictly necessary and ships can and will vary in this allocation, either increasing it to give crews and passengers a more luxurious (or at least more comfortable) journey or cutting back to give more space to useful components though at a cost of crew comfort.

Common areas cost MCr0.1 per ton.

STEP 12: ALLOCATE CARGO SPACE Any space left on the ship that has not been allocated to other components is considered to be free for cargo. There is no cost associated with areas designated for cargo but any cargo or other materials taken on board the ship can obviously not exceed the tonnage set aside for cargo.

STEP 13: FINALISE DESIGN Once cargo space has been allocated, the design process has been completed – your ship is now ready to fly.

All that remains is to total up the tonnage consumed by components to ensure you have not tried to squeeze too much within the hull and to add up all components to find the final cost of the ship. If you need to go back and revise any part of the ship, now is the time.

At this point, you should work out the maintenance cost of the ship. For this, simply take the total cost of the ship, minus any other ships it is carrying and divide by 1,000. Divide this final figure by 12, and you will have the regular maintenance cost of the ship, payable every Maintenance Period (see page 46).

WEAPONS Weapons (both offensive and defensive in nature) are an important component for many ships. Presented here are some of options available to spacecraft architects looking to weaponise their creations.

NUMBER OF WEAPONS There are only so many weapons that can be attached to a ship, the limiting factors being the supply of energy, the stresses imposed upon the hull through the use of high-powered weaponry and the surface area of a hull it is possible to cover with weapons.

Spacecraft therefore have a maximum number of Hardpoints to which weapons can be attached.

A ship has one Hardpoint for every full 100 tons of its hull.

Each weapon system uses one Hardpoints.

SMALL CRAFT Ships of less than 100 tons have Firmpoints instead of Hardpoints. A Firmpoint on a small craft is a fixed mount (typically forward-facing but there is no requirement for this) but can be upgraded to a single
(not double or triple) turret.

A ship of less than 35 tons has one Firmpoint. A ship of 35–70 tons has two Firmpoints, and a ship of 71–99 tons has three Firmpoints. Beyond this size, ships use Hardpoints.

A weapon mounted upon a Firmpoint has the following changes applied to it:

•  Weapons of Medium range or less are reduced to Adjacent range.
•  Weapons of greater range are reduced to Close range.
•  A weapon on a Firmpoint may not have its range increased beyond Close by any means.

TURRETS AND FIXED MOUNTS Turrets and fixed mounts use the same type of weapons but whereas a fixed mount may only fire at targets directly ahead of it, a turret rotates and may engage any target in sight.

One turret or fixed mount may be attached to each Hardpoint on a ship.

Up to three weapons may be mounted on a fixed mount
(small craft may only mount one weapon), while turrets can mount one, two or three weapons, depending on their type. These weapons need not be identical.

If two or more weapons are of the same type, they may be fired together. One attack roll is made for all weapons being fired but each additional weapon adds
+1 per damage dice to the final damage total.

Turrets and fixed mounts require just one gunner to operate, even if multiple weapons are mounted upon them.

spacecraft construction

The particle barbette is a very large type of turret, consuming 5 tons within a ship.

SPACECRAFT EQUIPMENT Beyond the basic drives, sensors and weapon systems, spacecraft can be customised to perform specialized functions in many different ways, giving rise to an unlimited amount of variation. These optional systems are covered here and many more can be found within High Guard. While they will be considered during the design of a spacecraft, most can be retrofitted to existing designs by any capable shipyard of sufficient Tech Level.

While many options can be accommodated by any shipyard capable of building or repairing spacecraft, some require far more advanced technology. Where a minimum Tech Level is required for an option, this is listed in the option's title.

AEROFINS Extendible aerofins improve a spacecraft's manoeuvrability in atmosphere, giving a far greater degree of control over its movements.

A ship with aerofins deployed gains DM+2 to all Pilot checks when within an atmosphere.

Aerofins consume 5% of the ship's tonnage and cost MCr0.1 per ton.

CARGO CRANE Built into the ceiling of a cargo hold, this overhead gantry crane is designed to shift cargo containers in and out of the ship. The crane's mechanism moves about the bay on a sliding jig and can extend beyond the cargo door on a gibbet to deposit freight directly onto a dockside or vehicle. The crane is strong enough to lift fully loaded 32 and 65 ton containers and can couple to most types of pallets or creates.

The traversing lift mechanism of a cargo crane consumes 2.5 tons but the gantry jigs require a further 0.5 tons per 150 tons of cargo space. Cargo cranes cost MCr1 per ton.

CARGO SCOOP A cargo scoop allows a ship to pick up cargo or other objects floating in space. The scoop includes anti- gravity baffles to minimise the impact but using a scoop with a high relative velocity is not recommended.

A Pilot check is required to scoop up an object; if failed, the ship collides with the object, taking an amount of damage equal to the negative Effect. Armor will negate this damage as normal, so most accidents will be embarrassing rather than catastrophic and merely require a little repainting. A scoop can sweep up one ton of material per round.

A cargo scoop consumes two tons of space and costs MCr0.5.

COLLAPSIBLE FUEL TANK Collapsible fuel tanks (also called fuel bladders) are large flexible bladders that expand when filled with hydrogen fuel. They take up cargo space in a ship and are used to extend range without the need to fit demountable tanks. Fuel cannot be pumped directly from these tanks to the jump drive and so a ship must complete a jump before it can use fuel stored in collapsible tanks.

spacecraft construction

When empty, collapsible tanks take up 1% of the tonnage they use when full. They cost Cr500 per ton.

**CONCEALED COMPARTMENT** A smuggler's favorite, concealed compartments are cunningly hidden from visual searches and shielded against sensors, allowing them to be used to transport contraband or other questionable items.

Up to 5% of a ship's tonnage may be designated as a concealed compartment and inflicts DM–2 to Electronics (sensors) checks and DM–4 to Investigate checks made to search for it.

Concealed compartments cost Cr20000 per ton.

**DOCKING SPACE** This is an internal bay in which a smaller auxiliary ship or vehicle can dock. When sealed, the docking space completely covers the auxiliary ship. It normally takes 1D minutes for the auxiliary ship to enter or leave the larger ship.

Docking space consumes an amount of tonnage equal to that of the largest ship to be docked, plus 10%
(round up to the nearest ton). Use Shipping size for vehicles, as detailed on page 137.

Docking space costs MCr0.25 per ton.

**DRONES** Drones are small robotic craft typically controlled from the bridge or dedicated station. They are used as labour-saving devices and for tasks that might otherwise endanger the crew.

Drones are typically human-sized and have gravitic drives that allow them to operate in both space and atmospheres. However, while they can land on a planet, they do not have the power to travel from the surface to orbit and must be recovered manually. The Electronics (remote ops) skill is required for their use.

Mining Drones: Mining drones are larger unmanned craft that allow a ship to mine asteroids without manoeuvring perilously close to spinning hunks of rock. Each set of five mining drones allows the ship to process 1D x 10 tons of asteroid per day (typically producing common ore, as detailed on page 244). The tonnage consumed includes ore handling machinery, allowing the ship to take on ore and transfer it to the cargo bay.

Every 10 tons dedicated to mining drones contains five drones and costs MCr1.

Probe Drones: Probe drones are for surveying planetary surfaces and are commonly found on board scout ships. They can be dropped from orbit in disposable entry shells but must be recovered manually. Probe drones are alo capable of surveying orbiting satellites, derelicts and other space debris, and can also be used as communication relays.

Each ton dedicated to probe drones contains five drones and costs MCr0.5

Repair Drones: Carrying repair drones allows a ship to make repairs during combat, allowing access to exterior components without risking crew. They also have sufficient intelligence to allow repairs to be initiated by a drone controller rather than a dedicated engineer.

Repair drones allows a Traveller with the Electronics
(remote ops) skill to use the Repair System action (see page 173). The repair drones are considered to have an Engineer skill level of 1 or the level the Traveller has in Electronics (remote ops), whichever is lower, in all specialities for the Repair System action alone.

A ship needs to dedicate 1% of its tonnage for effective repair drone coverage (minimum 1 ton), at a cost of MCr0.2 per ton.

FUEL PROCESSOR Fuel processors convert unrefined fuel (typically acquired through the use of a fuel scoop) into refined fuel, making the ship both self-reliant and safe.

Each ton of fuel processor can convert 20 tons of unrefined fuel into refined fuel per day.

Each ton consumed by fuel processors costs Cr50000. Fuel processors require 1 Power per ton.

FUEL SCOOP Fuel scoops allow an unstreamlined ship to gather unrefined fuel from a gas giant (streamlined ships have fuel scoops built in automatically).

Adding scoops costs MCr1 and consumes no tonnage.

spacecraft construction

HIGH STATEROOMS These are very similar to the staterooms detailed on page 182 but are trimmed in finer materials and offer more space for the occupant. They are not required for a ship to take on high passengers but a high passenger will almost always choose a ship that has a stateroom they deem appropriate. A high stateroom will typically grant DM+1 when seeking high passengers (see page 238).

A high stateroom consumes six tons of space and costs MCr0.8.

HOLOGRAPHIC CONTROLS (TL9) This bridge design incorporates advanced interactive holographic displays and can automatically reconfigure itself to adapt to changing situations. A bridge with holographic controls is always optimized for the task at hand and grants DM+2 when rolling for Initiative.

Holographic controls add +25% to the cost of the bridge.

Holographic Hull (TL10) Multiple holographic projectors are embedded within the hull allowing the ship to change hull colours, add graphics and adopt a different appearance (although its shape remains the same). Changing the hull colour or adding a stored graphic can be done by anyone with access to the ship's computer. Creating a complex colour scheme from scratch requires the talents of a skilled artist. Some young nobles try to outdo one another by changing the schemes daily or hiring artists to create the most complex scenes imaginable. Some pirates have made use of this system to simulate visual hull damage and lure other ships in with a GK distress call. However, most ship owner's use it for the purposes of advertising.

A holographic hull system costs Cr100000 per ton of hull and uses 1 Power for every two tons of hull. The projectors are small enough that they do not consume tonnage themselves.

LABORATORY Space allocated to laboratories can be used for research and experimentation, effectively turning the ship into a space-going laboratory.

Every four tons dedicated to laboratories space allows one scientist to perform research on board the ship.

The cost for research equipment can vary depending on the nature of research undertaken but is generally around MCr1 for every four tons.

LIBRARY (TL8) A library room contains computer files as well as lecterns, display screens, holotanks and perhaps even hard copies of books. A good library is useful for both research and passing time in jump space.

Having a library on board a ship grants DM+1 on any EDU check made when training for new skills in jump space or other periods of extended inactivity.

A library consumes four tons and costs MCr4.

LUXURY STATEROOMS This is state of the art accommodation for the most discerning passenger. It is noticeably a step above even the high stateroom and more richly appointed, found on private yachts and the most luxurious of liners. A luxury stateroom will typically grant DM+2 when seeking high passengers (see page 238).

A luxury stateroom consumes 10 tons of space and costs MCr1.5.

MEDICAL BAY The presence of a medical bay on board a ship can mean the difference between life and death for the crew, so long as there are sufficiently trained personnel on board.

A medical bay grants DM+1 to all Medic checks made within it.

Medical bays consume four tons and cost MCr2, which will support the treatment of five patients so long as one medic or autodoc (see Central Supply Catalogue, page 81) is present. It requires 1 Power.

Multiple medical bays can be combined into one larger facility.

MULTI-ENVIRONMENT SPACE The environment of this designated area can be modified to a wide range of conditions including salt water, extreme temperatures or unusual atmospheres, all to suit the needs of the occupant, usually an alien, animal or exotic plant.

One ton of environmental equipment is needed for every 20 tons of space designated as multi- environment, at a cost of MCr0.5 per ton of equipment. Each ton of environmental equipment requires 1 Power.

spacecraft construction

**SENSOR STATION** While every bridge has equipment dedicated to monitoring and controlling the ship's sensors (even if this is tied into the pilot's own screens), some ships benefit from having additional stations to handle an increased number of sensor operators. Some scout and survey ships feature additional sensor stations, while military vessels may feature similar stations dedicated to locating the enemy and electronic warfare.

Each sensor station allows an additional sensor operator to perform actions, costs MCr0.5 and consumes one ton.

**WORKSHOP** A workshop can be used to repair parts and fabricate new ones and is a common feature on scouts and other ships that operate in the wilderness areas of space.

Every six tons of space dedicated to workshops allows for two Travellers to use the Mechanic skill on board the ship with DM+2.

Workshops cost MCr0.15 per ton.

# COMMON SPACECRAFT

Space ships are constructed and sold at shipyards throughout the galaxy. Any Class A starport has a shipyard that can build any kind of ship, including a starship with jump drives; any Class B starport can build small craft and ships that do not have jump drives. The military procures vessels through these shipyards, as do corporations and private individuals can purchase ships they have designed through them as well. The major restriction on the purchase of ships is money.

OLDER SHIPS Many ships serve for decades or even centuries before being scrapped. Travellers and free traders are often forced by necessity to purchase outdated and damaged vessels instead of new and pristine ships. Travellers purchasing an outdated ship may do so by rolling on the Outdated Ships table. Older ships will have a number of 'quirks' that may affect their operation, rolled for on the Spacecraft Quirks table.

The scout ship is built for exploration, survey and courier duties, with many thousands in service throughout Charted space. Despite the small 100 ton hull, the scout is faster than most merchant ships and can jump further too.

While multiple crew positions are technically required, it is standard practice for a scout to be crewed by just one or two highly skilled individuals who understand the requirements needed for self-sufficiency.

A variation on the traditional scout/courier, the seeker is occasionally produced in this configuration by shipyards but it is far more common for it to be created by re-fitting an old Scout retired from active service.

A seeker has fewer staterooms and a smaller fuel tank but its larger cargo bay and mining drones allow a single well-skilled prospector to scavenge asteroids and make a living looking for deposits of valuable minerals.

Using a 200-ton hull, the free trader is an elementary interstellar merchant ship designed to ply the space lanes while carrying a mixture of cargo and passengers. It is the archetypal tramp freighter and common among adventuring groups and mercenary bands, often retrofitted with turrets,

weapons and other 'special' modifications. As such, actual specifications can vary wildly, often being proportional to the age of the ship but the free trader presented here is typical of a vessel fresh out of a shipyard.

Because SDBs have no jump drives, shifting them from system-to-system can be a problem. Some have jump shuttles that attach themselves to the boat and provide jump capability. Another method is simple transport in large bulk cargo carriers; the SDBs are loaded into 10,000-ton or 20,000-ton bulk carriers for the multi-parsec journey. This method, of course, is not recommended if immediate combat is expected at the destination.

# PSIONICS

In Traveller, a few humans (and aliens) have developed potent psionic abilities such as telepathy, telekinesis and even teleportation. Learning to properly control psionics is never easy and their use cannot always be relied upon but they are guaranteed to provide their practitioners with a dangerous edge simply not possible for normal humans.

THE IMPERIUM: PSIONICS AND THE LAW In the Charted Space universe, learning to harness psionics is a difficult process, made harder by the Third Imperium's ban on psionics. The Psionics Institutes that study mental powers have gone underground, following a disastrous attempt to guide human development centuries ago. In other civilizations, such as the Zhodani Consulate, psionics are a fully accepted part of the human condition.

PSIONIC STRENGTH Psionics are powered by the Psionic Strength
(PSI) characteristic. This characteristic cannot be rolled during Traveller creation without the referee's permission and even then it is quite rare. To determine a Traveller's PSI, roll 2D and subtract the number of terms served by the Traveller in all careers thus far
(PSI diminishes over time unless actively used). For example, a 38 year old Traveller (five terms served) would roll 2D–5 to determine their PSI. A Traveller with PSI 0 has no potential for psionic talents.

Using a psionic power costs a number of PSI points, temporarily reducing the Traveller's total. As the characteristic DM for all psionic skill checks is determined by the Travellers' current PSI total, it gets harder and harder to use powers as the Traveller's PSI declines.

RECOVERING PSI Expended PSI points are recovered at the rate of one point per hour, beginning three hours after the Traveller last used a psionic talent.

INSTITUTE TESTING A Traveller who wishes to develop psionic abilities requires training. In settings where psionics are uncommon or illegal, the Traveller must find a teacher, normally an underground Psionics Institute. Finding such an instructor can be an adventure in itself. Most teachers will charge at least Cr5000 to test the Traveller's abilities. Testing takes two weeks.

The first step is testing a Traveller's PSI, which is determined as described before (2D minus the number of terms served). If the Traveller has any PSI remaining, they can be trained.

Training requires four months of work and costs Cr100000. As part of training, the Traveller may attempt to learn any of the common psionic talents on the Psionic Training table by making a PSI check. They may attempt the talents in any order but suffer DM–1 per check attempted. If a Traveller learns a talent, they gain it at skill level 0.

TELEPATHIC POTENTIAL Telepaths are by far the most common among those with psionic potential. If a Traveller chooses Telepathy as their first talent, it will be gained automatically with no need to roll on the Psionic Training table.

Psionic Training Talent Learning DM Telepathy +4 Clairvoyance +3 Telekinesis +2 Awareness +1 Teleportation +0 Per previous talent acquisition check -1

For example, Luka has just determined that she has PSI 9. She now rolls to determine talents. She can select powers in any order, so she begins with telekinesis. She roll 2D+1 (her PSI DM), +2 (the Telekinesis learning DM) but unfortunately, the dice roll is a 3 for a total of 6 – less than the number she needs, so she does not gain telekinesis.

Next, she tries telepathy. She rolls 2D+1 (her PSI DM), +4 (the Telepathy learning DM) and –1 (one previous talent learning check) and gets a total of 10. Luka gains Telepathy 0.

PSIONIC TALENTS There are several psionic talents, each of which is controlled by a different skill. Within each talent are several powers, all of which may be used by a Traveller trained in the talent. The most common talents are:

Telepathy: Reading minds & communicating
**Clairvoyance:** Perceiving at a distance Telekinesis: Mind over matter
**Awareness:** Control over one's own mind and body Teleportation: Moving from one point to another instantly

**USING PSIONIC POWERS** To activate a power, the Traveller must make a skill check using the appropriate skill (Telepathy, Telekinesis and so on), adding their PSI DM, along with any other appropriate DMs. They must also spend the listed number of PSI points if they succeed or one point if they fail. If this cost brings them below zero PSI, then any excess points are applied as damage. A Traveller with no PSI points cannot attempt to activate a power.

Most powers can be used at a distance and have a Reach characteristic. This is the distance, using the Psionic Range table, at which the power can normally be used. However, a strong psion can increase the range at which they use powers with greater mental effort.

The Reach of a power can be increased by one Range Band if twice the PSI Cost is paid and increased by two Range Bands if the PSI Cost is multiplied by four.

USING THE PSION CAREER A Traveller may only attempt to enter the Psion career with the permission of the referee normally because of the single Life Event (see page 46) that allows it.

Unlike other careers, a Psion takes skills from the appropriate Specialist table instead of the Service Skills table during basic training.

The Psion must still roll to acquire talents when they determine their PSI. When rolling on the Service Skills table, if the Psion gains the skill for a talent they do not yet possess, they may attempt another roll to learn that talent.

The assignments for Psions are considered to be separate careers and a Traveller must roll for qualification as normal if they choose to change assignment during their career.

Psionic Range Range Band Distance to Target Personal Less than one meter Close 1 to 5 meters Short 6 to 10 meters Medium 11 to 50 meters Long 51 meters to 250 meters Very Long 251 meters to 500 meters Distant 501 meters to 5 kilometers Very Distant 6 kilometers to 500 kilometers Continental 501 to 5,000 kilometers Planetary 5,001 to 50,000 kilometers

For example, a psionic Traveller could read the mind of a target at Long range using Read Surface Thoughts for 2 PSI points normally, or boost it to Very Long range for 4 PSI points, or even Distant for 8 PSI points.

Telepathy Telepathy is the talent of mind-to-mind contact. It is normally subtle by nature but can be used to bluntly crush the wills of those who oppose the telepath.

Life Detection The most elementary form of telepathy is the ability to detect the presence of other minds. Life detection enables a Traveller to sense the presence of other minds, the number of minds present, the general type of minds (animal, human and do on) and their approximate location.

Life detection is reasonably sophisticated and can distinguish intelligent beings from bacteria or unimportant animals in the area. It functions best in detecting intelligent minds. Shielded minds are undetectable. If an individual whom the telepath knows is detected using this power, they will be recognised.

Check: Easy (4+) Telepathy check (1D x 10 seconds, PSI) Reach: Distant PSI Cost: 1

Mind Link This power is used by telepaths to communicate with one another – it is far easier to create a long lasting telepathic link to another telepath than to a mundane. Both telepaths must use this power for it to work but once this is done, they may communicate silently with one another for a number of minutes equal to the combined Effects of their Telepathy checks.

Check: Easy (4+) Telepathy check (1D seconds, PSI) Reach: Distant PSI Cost: 1

Telempathy The communication of emotions and basic feelings is accomplished by telempathy. This ability serves well in the handling of animals and beasts of burden but may also be applied as a psychological weapon against sophonts. Sending of emotions such as love, hate, fear and others may influence other beings (although not necessarily in the manner desired). The Effect of the Telepathy check is used to judge the strength of the emotion projected.

Telempathy also allows the emotions and feelings of others to be read by a Traveller.

Other telepaths will always recognise when someone is using telempathy to bend their emotions but others will not. The change in mood may be dramatic and inexplicable but most will simply ascribe it to the mercurial nature of human emotions.

Check: Routine (6+) Telepathy check (1D x 10 seconds, PSI) Reach: Long PSI Cost: 1

Read Surface Thoughts The most commonly known feature of telepathy is the ability to read the thoughts of other individuals. Only active and current thoughts are read by this ability, with the subject (if themselves not a telepath) unaware of the activity. Individuals with telepathic ability cannot be read due to the presence of their natural shields, unless they willingly lower their shielding. The Effect of the check determines the clarity of the telepath's perceptions.

Check: Average (8+) Telepathy check (1D x 10 seconds, PSI) Reach: Long PSI Cost: 2

Send Thoughts Complementary to the ability to read surface thoughts is the power to send thoughts to others. Such individuals need not be telepathic themselves to receive such thoughts. Telepathic individuals are normally open to such transmissions but may close their shields against them if they become bothersome or threatening.

Check: Difficult (10+) Telepathy check (1D x 10 seconds, PSI) Reach: Distant PSI Cost: 2

SPECIAL POWERS The psionic powers described here are not the only manifestations of psionic ability. There are other, rarer abilities such as precognition, electrokinesis, telepathic control or astral projection that may also be encountered but these abilities are usually plot devices used by the referee and are found in other Traveller books.

**Suggestion** The telepath implants a thought, idea or command into the mind of another, who interprets it as their own. Unless the suggestion is plainly harmful the subject will follow the command or enact upon the idea. If the Effect of the Telepathy check is 6 or more, even suicidal suggestions will be followed.

Check: Very Difficult (12+) Telepathy check (1D x 10 seconds, PSI) Reach: Short
**PSI Cost:** 3

**Probe** The application of great psionic strength will enable a telepath to delve deep into the mind of a subject and to then read their innermost thoughts. Questioning can be used in the procedure to force the subject to divulge specific information. The telepath can easily determine deliberate untruths told (thought) by the subject. Probe cannot be used against a shielded mind. Again, the Effect of the check determines the clarity of the telepath's perceptions.

Check: Very Difficult (12+) Telepathy check (1D minutes, PSI) Reach: Close
**PSI Cost:** 4

**Assault** Violence may be dealt by a telepath. Against an unshielded mind, the result is automatic unconsciousness and possible death. Against a shielded mind, an instant duel ensues. An unshielded mind, when assaulted telepathically, is rendered unconscious immediately and causes Effect x 3 damage.

When a shielded mind is assaulted, the two telepaths make opposed Telepathy checks. If the attacker wins, the victim suffers damage.

Check: Formidable (14+) Telepathy check (1D seconds, PSI) Reach: Short
**PSI Cost:** 8

**Shield** All telepathically enabled Travellers learn how to create a mental shield, which protects the mind against unwanted telepathic interference. Such a shield is automatically in force at all times and requires no PSI expenditure to maintain but can be lowered to allow telepathic contact or use of telepathic powers.

CLAIRVOYANCE Clairvoyance is a talent that allows a person to sense events at some location displaced from the viewer. There are several levels of clairvoyant ability.

Clairvoyance powers allow eavesdropping activities as well as spying and detection-free exploration of situations. While telepathic life detection will determine the presence of living minds in a closed room, for example, sense will determine if a room is occupied or empty. Clairvoyant activity cannot be sensed by others, including by other psionic talented individuals.

Sense The basic power to sense things at some point in the distance. A Traveller will become aware of the most rudimentary characteristics of a location when applying this ability. For example, the referee will give a basic description, without detail: 'a room, containing four dogs' or 'an open plain with a tree and no animals or men present'. The clairvoyant Traveller must state the range at which they are applying the power and will generally sense the most interesting or important feature at that range. The Effect of the check determines the level of accuracy and clarity.

Check: Routine (6+) Clairvoyance check (1D x 10 seconds, PSI) Reach: Very Distant PSI Cost: 1

Tactical Awareness With this power, the Traveller can perceive dangers and foes around them using their clairvoyant abilities. This enhanced spatial perception allows them to ignore the effects of darkness, smoke, fog or other environmental effects that impede vision. They may also detect hidden foes within range. The Effect of the check determines the number of combat rounds the awareness lasts.

Check: Average (8+) Clairvoyance check (1D seconds, PSI) Reach: Long PSI Cost: 2

Clairvoyance This specific power allows actual viewing of a situation at some displaced point. The clairvoyant Traveller must state the range at which they are applying this power. The Effect of the check determines the level of detail perceived.

Check: Average (8+) Clairvoyance check (1D x 10 seconds, PSI) Reach: Very Distant PSI Cost: 1

Clairaudience This power is identical to clairvoyance, with the exception that it allows hearing instead of seeing.

Check: Average (8+) Clairvoyance check (1D x 10 seconds, PSI) Reach: Very Distant PSI Cost: 1

Clairsentience A Traveller is capable of both seeing and hearing a specific situation by using this power.

Check: Difficult (10+) Clairvoyance check (1D x 10 seconds, PSI) Reach: Very Distant PSI Cost: 1

TELEKINESIS Telekinesis is the talent that allows objects to be manipulated without physically touching them. Any manipulation is treated as if the Traveller was physically handling the item but physical danger, pain or other stimuli are not present. Telekinesis includes a limited amount of sensory awareness, sufficient to allow intelligent manipulation.

Telekinesis This basic form of the talent allows the Traveller to move objects at range. The Effect of the check determines the duration of the telekinesis in combat rounds. The number of PSI points spent determines the mass that can be moved.

Check: Average (8+) Telekinesis check (1D seconds, PSI) Reach: Short PSI Cost: 1 per 10kg

Flight By applying telekinesis to their own body, the Traveller can fly, or at least levitate over short distances. The Traveller can fly for a number of rounds equal to the Effect of the check at a speed of 15 meters per round.

Check: Difficult (10+) Telekinesis check (1D seconds, PSI) PSI Cost: 5

Telekinetic Punch Telekinesis can be used as a direct attack, smashing the foe with a blast of telekinetic force. The damage inflicted is equal to the Effect. Protection from any armor is applied as normal.

Check: Average (8+) Telekinesis check (1D seconds, PSI) Reach: Short PSI Cost: 1

**Microkinesis** This more challenging form of telekinesis allows for fine manipulation of very small or even microscopic objects. A telekinetic can use this power to pick locks, perform microsurgery, sabotage a computer system and so forth.

Check: Difficult (10+) Telekinesis check (1D x 10 seconds, PSI) Reach: Close
**PSI Cost:** 3

**Pyrokinesis** By exciting the substance of an object, the Traveller can raise its temperature, possibly even causing it to burst into flames.

Telekinesis Effect Target... 0–4 becomes warmer but is undamaged. 5–8 is burnt, suffering 1D damage. 9+ suffers 2D damage and may burst into flame if flammable.

Check: Routine (6+) Telekinesis check (1D x 10 seconds, PSI) Reach: Short
**PSI Cost:** 3

AWARENESS Awareness is the psionic talent that allows fine control of one's own body. Awareness powers never have Reach – they are used only on the Traveller themselves. Awareness is not capable of affecting others and may never be used for healing or enhancing other Travellers.

**Suspended Animation** Personal body activity may be suspended for varying periods of time. A Traveller with awareness may enter a suspended animation state (similar to cold sleep but without the intrinsic danger of death) by willing themselves into it. Such a state continues for seven days, without need for food or water and with minimal air needs. The Traveller could effectively travel in a cold sleep berth, without actually undergoing cold sleep and its dangers. Suspended animation may be stopped at any time, provided external stimulus is given to awaken the sleeper (such as a friend nudging them or a mechanical alarm).

Check: Average (8+) Awareness check (1D minutes, PSI)
**PSI Cost:** 3

Enhanced Strength PSI points may be converted to STR points on a temporary basis. The Traveller makes the commitment, reduces their available PSI by a specified number of points and increases their STR characteristic by the same amount. STR reaches its new level immediately, remains at that peak for number of minutes equal to the Effect of the Awareness check x 10 and then declines at the rate of one point per minute until the Traveller's normal STR is reached.

Check: Average (8+) Awareness check (1D seconds, PSI) PSI Cost: STR increase

Enhanced Endurance PSI points may be converted to END points on a temporary basis. The Traveller makes the commitment, reduces their available PSI by a specified number of points and increases their END characteristic by the same amount. END reaches its new level immediately, remains at that peak for number of minutes equal to the Effect of the Awareness check x 10 and then declines at the rate of one point per minute until the Traveller's normal END is reached.

Check: Average (8+) Awareness check (1D seconds, PSI) PSI Cost: END increase

Fortitude By channelling psychic energy to their skeletal structure and boosting their healing rate, the Traveller can enhance their ability to absorb damage. Fortitude lasts a number of rounds equal to the Effect of the Awareness check and provides Protection equal to the number of PSI points expended. Fortitude stacks with worn armor.

Check: Difficult (10+) Awareness check (1D seconds, PSI) PSI Cost: Amount of Armor

Inspiration Through both mental and physical activities, psionic enhancement can lead to flashes of inspiration, dexterous fine-tuning and momentarily toughened physique. Inspiration adds DM+2 to any one check the Traveller attempts within the next minute.

Check: Average (8+) Awareness check (1D seconds, PSI) PSI Cost: 1

Regeneration Wounds may be healed by the application of this power, exchanging one PSI point to regenerate one lost characteristic point. Should one session of healing be insufficient, further healing and regeneration may be applied after expended PSI is recovered. Regeneration may also be applied to the growing of new limbs or organs to replace lost ones or to heal old wounds suffered prior to psionic training. Regeneration may not be used to counteract ageing, nor may it be used to regain lost SOC.

Check: Difficult (10+) Awareness check (1D x 10 seconds, PSI) PSI Cost: Amount healed

Teleportation Teleportation is a talent that allows effectively instantaneous movement from one point to another point, without regard to intervening matter. Psionic teleportation is limited to the movement of the teleported Traveller's body and (for highly skilled teleports) their clothing and equipment.

Check: Average (8+) Teleportation check (1D seconds, PSI) Reach: Distant PSI Cost: 2

To teleport with clothing (but not armor) and up to 10kg of equipment, the Teleportation check is increased to Difficult (10+) and costs an additional 2 PSI.

To teleport with clothing (but not armor) and up to 500kg of equipment, the Teleportation check is increased to Very Difficult (12+) and costs an additional 4 PSI.

Teleportation always involves the movement of one's body to another location. Independent items or other individuals may not be moved. Teleportation involves certain requirements in order to be accurate and to ensure obedience of the laws of physics.

Pre-knowledge of Destination: A Traveller must always have a mental image of their destination before teleporting. This mental image is acquired by personally visiting the location first (this includes viewing it from a distance), having the mental image implanted in one's mind (via telepathy) by another person who has visited the destination or by viewing the location through clairvoyance.

Energy and Momentum: Teleportation involves serious restrictions on movement in order to ensure the conservation of energy and momentum, two laws of physics that can cause teleporting Travellers serious issues.

On planetary surfaces, teleportation is restricted to jumps of no more than Very Distant ranges. Jumps beyond visual range involve disorientation for a period of 2D – Effect of Teleportation check x 10 seconds.

This restriction results from the law of conservation of momentum; on a rotating planet, two locations will have different rotational speeds and directions. A jump from a point on the Earth's equator to its antipode would result in a total velocity difference between the Traveller and their surroundings of over 3,300 kilometers per hour.

Changes in altitude (actually all movement to locations of differing gravitational potential) will result in potential energy changes, manifesting themselves as alterations in body temperature. A jump of one kilometer straight down will result in an internal temperature increase of 2.5oC; this is sufficient to cause extreme fever, brain damage and even death. A jump upwards will cool the body by the same amount, with equally serious results. To be safe, a jump may not involve an elevation change of more than 400 meters and multiple jumps should not involve a cumulative elevation change or more than 600 meters in one hour. These problems may be circumvented somewhat through the use of technological devices such as energy compensators, heated suits and other means. Travellers may feel driven to invent such materials, commission their invention or seek them out from those who already have them.

PSIONIC TECHNOLOGY The ban on psionics within the Imperium means that most of these technologies are illegal in the Charted Space universe. The exceptions are anti-psionic devices like the psionic shield.

Psi-Drugs (TL8): These drugs restore PSI if taken when the Traveller has already spent PSI points or temporarily increase the Traveller's PSI if taken when they are at full strength.

Psi-Drug PSI Restored PSI Boosted Cost Standard 6 +4 Cr1000 Double 9 +6 Cr4000 Special 12 +10 Cr10000

A Traveller who takes more than one dose of Standard or Double psi-drug, or a single dose of the Special psi-drug must make an END check, with DM-1 per dose of psi-drug taken in the last week. If the check is failed, the Traveller falls ill, suffering 3D damage and permanently reducing their PSI by one.

**Inhibitor Drug (TL9):** Psionic inhibitors dampen the brain's ability to generate psychic effects. A Traveller who takes (or, more often, is forcibly injected with) an inhibitor drug suffers DM-3 to all PSI-related checks and cannot regain PSI points. Each hour, the Traveller may make an END check to throw off the effects of the drug. Inhibitor drugs have no effect on non-psionic individuals. The drugs cost Cr500 per dose.

**Psionic Shield (TL12):** Any armor incorporating a helmet or hood can be outfitted with a psionic shield, automatically blocking all telepathy powers. This costs Cr4000. Buildings and vehicles can also be psionically shielded but this is much more costly, increasing the cost of the vehicle by 10%.

Psionic Interface (TL14): Any weapon or technological device can be outfitted with a psionic interface. A Traveller using a device with a psionic interface can use their PSI DM instead of their DEX DM when using the weapon or device; a Traveller without psionic ability cannot use the device. The Traveller must either touch the device or use Telekinesis (at no PSI cost) to interact with it. Adding a psionic interface increases the cost of the device by 20%.

Teleportation Suit (TL12): This device can be integrated into a suit of armor or worn as a form- hugging body-suit. It rapidly cools or warms the body after a teleport, minimising the damage from sudden energy gains or losses. The suit costs Cr5000, and allows a Traveller to jump up to 600 meters up or down in a single teleport or up to 10 kilometers in a single hour when using successive jumps.

# TRADE

As they explore the galaxy, Travellers will have plenty of opportunities to earn money and either become rich or simply keep their spacecraft running. Some may hire out their services as mercenaries, while others concentrate on developing a network of contacts that allow them to easily find wealthy patrons. However, everyone can indulge in a little speculative trade or other commercial interests.

Travellers traditionally deal in three forms of commerce; taking on passengers, shipping freight and speculative trade.

ON TRADE At first glance, the trading rules in this chapter may look like they will take time away from adventuring and involve a lot of dice rolling. However, a canny referee can use them to their advantage without increasing their workload.

We recommend that, for most campaigns, referees hand over this entire chapter to the Travellers and simply let them get on with it. You will find they should be able to generate a fairly regular amount of cash, which will cover their ship expenses and perhaps allow them some new equipment. Occasionally they will get a 'big score' and occasionally they will make a loss. However, overall there should be a steady progression upwards in their bank balance.

Letting the Travellers handle all their own trading allows the referee to concentrate on their own adventure, perhaps quickly revising the next section or prepping a new encounter while the Travellers work out what they want to trade next and where. It also encourages the Travellers to consult star maps and read planetary descriptions, which helps immerse themselves in the universe.

In short, referees have little to fear in letting their Travellers loose in this chapter and everyone stands to gain.

PASSENGERS Passage on board any ship is standardised into three categories; high passage, middle passage, basic passage and low passage, reflecting the quality of service that can be expected during the journey (in a way reflecting first class, business class and cattle class on airlines today). The cost increases with the distance travelled and is for a single jump.

High Passage: This is the equivalent of a luxury cruise or flight in first class. Comfortable quarters, good food and staff to wait on hand and foot are expected. It requires a stateroom, one ton of cargo space and one level of Steward per 10 passengers.

Middle Passage: This is 'standard' class. There will be a stateroom for every passenger and occasional service from the steward but it is considered more functional than enjoyable as an experience. It requires a stateroom, 100kg of cargo and one level of Steward per 100 passengers

Basic Passage: For those not willing to risk low berths, the option of basic passage, or steerage as it is often called, exists. Staterooms will be shared (typically two people to a stateroom) or, on some less scrupulous ships, areas in the cargo bay or engineering will be set aside for very basic accommodation and services (which may only extend to two meals a day and meagre washroom facilities). This requires two tons of spare room on the spacecraft, a resilient personality on the part of the passenger and comes with a 10kg baggage allowance.

Low Passage: This involves being cryogenically frozen and stuffed into a tube with the intention of being thawed out when the destination is reached. It is by no means unknown for Travellers to die during low passage, whether from system shock at being frozen, being improperly revived or simply a malfunction of the low berth. This requires a low berth and comes with a 10kg baggage allowance.

Travellers considering taking passengers on their own ships should consult the Spacecraft Operations chapter for the requirements needed to do so.

**SEEKING PASSENGERS** Having enough staterooms (or low berths) on board a spacecraft is one thing – but Travellers looking to make money from bringing passengers on board must find them first.

The number of potential passengers seeking passage to any given destination varies depending on a number of factors. When looking to see how many passengers are available, roll 2D on the Passenger Traffic table four times, once each for Low, Basic, Middle and High passengers and apply the following modifiers:

The Effect of an Average (8+) Broker, Carouse or Streetwise check

Chief Steward DM+ highest Steward skill on ship

Rolling for High Passengers DM-4 Rolling for Low Passengers DM+1

For both source and destination worlds, apply these DMs: World Population 1 or less DM-4 World Population 6–7 DM+1 World Population 8 or more DM+3

Starport A DM+2 Starport B DM+1 Starport E DM-1 Starport X DM-3

Amber Zone DM+1 Red Zone DM-4

Each parsec of destination past the first DM-1

The referee may add their own modifiers as they see fit, factoring in a war that might induce people to leave a world, for example, or a tourist attraction or booming economy drawing people to a planet.

Passengers pay an amount for their passage depending on the distance travelled and degree of luxury as shown on the Passage and Freight table.

More details on passengers can be found on page

240. The number of passengers available cannot usually exceed the number of people resident on a planet, except in unusual circumstances. For example, a passenger liner might break down in a nearly uninhabited system, so a planet with a population of only a few dozen might have hundreds of passengers clamouring for transport out.

FREIGHT Travellers not wishing to risk speculative trade can go for the safer option of shipping freight. Freight shipments pay a fixed rate as shown on the Passage and Freight table.

Freight lots must be transported in their entirety and come in three sizes.

EXCITING PASSENGERS Referees on the ball will have already spotted the possibility of using passengers as a way to spice up the lives of their Travellers. This is in perfect keeping with Traveller and has our wholehearted support.

For example, passengers may be wanted criminals, a runaway couple hoping to escape their cruel parents, a desperate escapee from prison looking to hijack a ship to freedom, a rogue psion... or anything else the referee can devise to make life 'interesting' for the Travellers.

While this is not recommended for every time the Travellers take passengers on board their ship, referees might like to use the Random Passenger table as a starting point to creating passengers the Travellers will remember or perhaps even the Allies and Enemies or Random Quirks and Personalities tables on page 92.

A freight lot cannot be broken up. Cargo is paid for upon delivery, assuming it is delivered on time. Failing to deliver cargo on time reduces the amount paid by 1D+4 x 10%.

**MAIL** Mail is a special form of freight, consisting of large data storage drums that contain a vast amount of information, as well as physical packages, which must be transported from one world to another but not vital enough to be entrusted to the x-boat service or a private courier. To determine if there is mail available, roll 2D and then apply the modifiers on the Mail table.

- Travellers' highest SOC DM

On 12 or more, the Travellers are chosen to transport mail to the destination world. Mail containers take up five tons of space and the Travellers will be paid Cr25000 for transporting the container. There will be 1D containers available to transport and the Travellers must take them all or none at all.

Mail deliveries are priced at a flat-rate and the payment does not scale with distance.

SPECULATIVE TRADE & SMUGGLING The greatest profits and losses are to be found in speculative trade – buying low and selling high across the stars. It sounds simple but while great fortunes have been made through speculative trade, many ships have found themselves bankrupted by the same process.

Speculative trade is performed by going through the following steps:

Trade Checklist

1. Find a supplier or local broker 2. Determine goods available 3. Determine purchase price 4. Purchase goods 5. Travel to another market 6. Find a buyer or local broker 7. Determine sale price

FIND A SUPPLIER On worlds regularly visited by trade vessels, finding a supplier is easy. There are traders and brokers at the starport eager to deal with offworlders and the whole planetary economy may rely on trade with other planets. Technologically advanced worlds will have computer networks that can be searched for suppliers, while on lower-tech worlds traders seek out suppliers in markets and bazaars. Travellers can search for multiple suppliers but there is DM-1 per previous attempt on a planet in the same month.

The following skill checks are used to find suppliers:

Finding a Supplier or Broker: Average (8+) Broker check (1D days, EDU or SOC). Finding a Black Market Supplier or Broker of Illegal Goods: Average (8+) Streetwise check (1D days, EDU or SOC). Finding an Online Supplier or Broker (TL8+ worlds only): Average (8+) Admin check (1D hours, EDU).

The size of the Starport provides a bonus to finding a supplier.

Class A: DM+6 Class B: DM+4 Class C: DM+2

DETERMINE GOODS AVAILABLE Goods are divided into two categories; Common and Trade Goods. Common Goods can be purchased on any world. Trade Goods can usually only be found on a world with a matching Trade code. The amount of each type of goods available is limited – the tons column on the Trade Goods table determines how many tons of a given type of goods are available for purchase.

Availability is influenced by the size of the market. On Population 3– apply DM–3 to the roll for quantity. This can result in a number of zero or less, reflecting no availability of even common goods. Conversely, Population 9+ worlds have vast economies and grant DM+3 on the roll for lot quantities.

A supplier will have all Common Goods available, the Trade Goods that match the world's Trade codes and a quantity of randomly determined goods equal to the

LOCAL BROKERS A trader can hire a local broker to help find goods and negotiate a deal. Local brokers will have a Broker skill of 2D/3 and will normally charge a flat fee of 10% of the gross proceeds of a transaction. Local brokers gain DM+2 on negotiations, since their local knowledge helps them find the best deal and avoid the pitfalls of dealing with outsiders.

For illegal goods, a local broker or fixer will have a Streetwise skill of 2D/3 and gain DM+2 on negotiations but charge 20% of the gross proceeds, possibly higher for highly illegal or dangerous cargos. If the roll to determine the fixer's skill is a natural 2, they are an informer, government agent or double-crosser. The referee should determine resulting events, which should remind the Travellers why it is best to tread carefully when dealing in illegal goods.

MAKING A LIVING Speculative trading can be harsh to the newcomer, especially if they are unskilled, and even the most experienced broker can be caught by a bad trade and lose tens of thousands of Credits – or more.

It may occur to some Travellers to ask how can the big shipping corporations even survive, let alone make a profit, if they are doing the same risky speculative trading as everyone else. The answer is simple.

They don't.

Just as in our world, the big boys follow different rules to the little guy. A big, interstellar corporation not only has far larger ships that can carry far more cargo but also government contracts, the ability to bribe their way ahead of small competitors, contacts among suppliers, tax breaks and many other ploys that keep them one step ahead.

Population code of the world. Roll on the Trade Goods table to randomly determine the goods available, re- rolling results 61–65 unless dealing with a black market supplier. If you roll the same type of goods multiple times, then the supplier has extra amounts of those goods available.

Some goods are illegal and can be purchased only through a black market supplier. A black market supplier has whatever illegal goods match world's Trade codes, as well as any randomly rolled illegal goods. Roll 1D on the Trade Goods table and use '6' as the leading digit. Illegal goods can include illegal exotics, which may not be strictly illegal but have
'questionable' providence.

For example, the Travellers have contacted a supplier on an Industrial world. Consulting the Trade Goods table, the supplier has the following goods available: Common Electronics, Common Machine Parts, Common Manufactured Goods, Common Raw Materials, Common Vehicles, Common Ore, Advanced

Electronics, Advanced Machine Parts, Advanced Manufactured Goods, Advanced Weapons, Advanced Vehicles, Polymers & Robots, as all those goods are Common or Industrial. The referee can now generate an additional number of goods equal to the world's _Population code to reflect the random items the_ supplier has.

**DETERMINE PURCHASE PRICE** To determine the purchase price, roll 3D and apply the following modifiers:

+The Traveller's Broker skill (or the local broker's skill)
+any DM from the Purchase DM column
–any DM from the Sale DM column
–the supplier's Broker skill (this is assumed to be Broker 2, but may vary)

In cases where multiple Purchase or Sale DMs apply, use only the largest from each column.

Next, consult the Purchase column of the Modified Price table. The trader does not have to accept this price but if they reject the deal, they cannot deal with that supplier again for at least a month.

ILLEGAL GOODS Some goods are illegal throughout the Imperium. These are marked as illegal in the Trade Goods tables. Other goods are illegal only on particular worlds (see Law Level, page 255).

Trade in illegal goods is highly profitable but risky. Universally illegal goods have high Sale DMs. For other banned goods, their Sale DM is the difference between the Law Level they are banned at and the Law Level of the world. For example, Military Weapons are banned at Law Level 3. If a trader smuggles any weapons onto a Law Level 9 world, the weapons have Sale DM+6 (if a type of goods is both universally and locally illegal, use whichever Sale DM is higher).

The downside of smuggling is that if the trader is caught, they face fines or imprisonment. See Law Levels, page 255.

Purchase and Sale Prices are calculated as a percentage of the Base Price.

Modified Price Result Purchase Price Sale Price
-3 or less 300% 10%
-2 250% 20%
-1 200% 30%
| 0 | 175% 40% |

| 22 | 30% 200% |
| 23 | 25% 250% |
| 24 | 20% 300% | 25+ 15% 400%

SELLING GOODS Selling goods works just like purchasing goods, with the following changes. A Traveller must find a buyer, instead of a supplier. The same rules apply.

When selling goods, add the Sale DMs for the world's Trade codes and subtract the Purchase DMs. Deduct the purchaser's Broker skill (this is assumed to be Broker 2, but may vary).

If a Traveller does not accept the price offered for their goods, they must find another buyer or wait a month.

# WORLD AND UNIVERSE CREATION

A universe needs to be created for Travellers to explore and find adventure. Many referees use published universes to save themselves a great deal of time, such as Charted Space or 2300AD.

However, some referees will prefer to create their own universes. This chapter will show you how.

SECTORS AND SUBSECTORS A universe is mapped in convenient segments, called subsectors. Each subsector is an area of hexagonal cells measuring eight hexes by 10 hexes. Since the recommended scale is one parsec (equal to 3.26 light years) per hex, the subsector covers an area 10 parsecs by eight parsecs.

Sixteen subsectors (arranged in four rows of four subsectors each) form a sector, about the largest size practical for a continuing Traveller campaign.

Mapping subsectors consists of two sequences: star mapping and world design. Star mapping examines each hexagon in the subsector grid and determines if there is a star system present. It also determines the presence or absence of starports, bases and fuel for starships. All of this information is coded onto the subsector hexes and serves as a guide to the referee and Travellers during interstellar travel. World design examines the single most important world in each system and determines basic characteristics for it. This information is retained for use during adventures on the world's surface.

Note that not all universes will require the creation of a subsector or sector. Indeed, entire campaigns can be set in just one star system or on a single world, or even within a single city.

STAR MAPPING In order to create a subsector, the referee uses a blank subsector map and dice to determine the presence of systems, starports and bases. Reading World Profiles on page 248 shows the coding and placement of information about worlds within a subsector. This format should be used to allow Travellers and referees to note information that

would normally be available to them. The referee may elect to omit some information and only allow it to be inserted after the Travellers have determined it for themselves.

World Occurrence: There is a basic one-half chance that one world (and its attendant stellar system) will be in a hex on a subsector or sector map. Systematically check each hex, throwing 1D and marking the hex with a circle if the result is a 4, 5 or 6. This indicates that a world of note or interest is present; otherwise, leave the hex blank.

The referee may elect to alter the normal chances of worlds, making them more frequent or less frequent to correspond to specific regions of the galaxy. A 50% density (no DM) is appropriate for the most areas. Apply DM-2 for rift (all but empty) sectors, DM-1 for sparse sectors and DM+1 for densely populated sectors.

Starport Type: Many worlds have starports, their presence being essential to interstellar trade and commerce. See Starports, page 257.

Bases: Stellar systems may have bases for military forces, the navy, the scouts or other arms of interstellar government. See Bases, page 259.

Bases will also help determine political boundaries in the sector. An interstellar government will place bases along its borders to guard against aggression from rival states or to control local systems. The presence of multiple bases within a few parsecs might indicate a contested border or a mighty stronghold.

Gas Giants: A star system may have one or more gas giant planets (similar to Jupiter or Saturn). The presence of a gas giant allows streamlined starships to refuel by skimming; this eliminates fuel cost for the vessel and increases profit. It also allows refuelling at systems that do not have starports. Refuelling in this fashion requires 1D days to travel to the gas giant and commence refuelling. Fuel gained by skimming is unrefined.

Gas giants are relatively common. Roll 10+ for a gas giant not to be present in the system. If one is present, mark the system hex in accordance with the world format.

System Name: Each system is generally named for the primary world within. This name should be decided upon by the referee and placed in the hex for identification.

**Travel Zones:** Most worlds are assumed to be civilised or at least amenable to Travellers and visitors. Some, however, are caught in the throes of war, plagued by disease or simply not ready for interstellar visitors. Such worlds are classified by Travel Zones to denote such status. In most cases, the referee should indicate Travel Zones based on the information available. Two such zone types exist; Amber and Red.

Amber Zones indicate that Travellers should exercise caution when visiting such worlds. The Amber code may mean that the citizens of the world are xenophobic, that the political situation is chaotic or that some other danger exists within the system.

GALACTIC DIRECTIONS North, south, east and west are insufficient terms for referring to directions within the galaxy. Instead, the following conventions have achieved widespread acceptance when referring to direction: Coreward – toward the galactic core; Rimward – toward the rim of the galaxy; Spinward – towards the direction the galaxy is rotating (or spinning); Trailing – opposite the spin of the galaxy.

Red Zones usually indicate that a major danger exists within the system. This danger may be disease and the world is quarantined. The system may be involved in a war and surface or space battles may be probable. Red Zones are also used to show a government edict prohibiting entry to the system or world. This may be to protect a local civilization that is still developing and not yet ready for interstellar contacts or to protect valuable resources until the government can mine them.

Polities: Worlds may be independent or part of a larger polity that spans a system or more. Polities range from loose confederations of a few worlds with common trade or defence policies or cultural links, to vast star empires containing thousands of systems and trillions of citizens. Polity borders should be drawn on the map. Note that larger polities will usually have sub-domains, which could also be marked.

Communications Routes: Within the subsector, local governments will have established communications routes connecting some (but not all) worlds. These routes serve as a conduit for messages between businesses and governments, as well as people. They also serve as the basic routes that liners and large freighters travel. The referee should examine the subsector map and connect key worlds with communications routes. If the subsector is an isolated community, the routes might not leave the map; if it is part of a larger confederation or empire, the routes will probably leave the edges to join with other parts of the sector. Use starports as guides when drawing communication routes – in general, the best routes are the shortest connections between Class A starports and naval bases.

Communications routes should be carefully drawn so as to avoid making all parts of the subsector accessible; a subsector should have some areas as backwaters for exploration and adventure. Communications routes are drawn as single lines connecting hexes on the subsector grid.

Trade Routes: Trade routes link worlds that have strong commercial ties. Consult the Trade Routes table

- if any pair of worlds matching the two columns are within four parsecs of each other and there is a jump-1 or jump-2 route between them, then mark a trade route connecting those two worlds.

Trade Routes First World Second World Industrial High Tech

Asteroid Desert Ice-Capped Non-Industrial High Population Rich

Agricultural Garden Waterworld

The subsector or sector map, once generated, shows the distribution of star systems in space and their relationships to each other in terms of relative distance and commercial space-lane connections.

WORLD CREATION The term world refers to the various bodies contained in a stellar system; it encompasses planets, satellites and asteroid belts. For example, the single most important world in a system may not be a planet at all but a satellite of a gas giant or maybe a planetoid within an asteroid belt.

The worlds contained in star systems on the subsector map may be further classified in terms of their gross physical characteristics and their effects on persons living on them or travelling to them. These codes indicate specific facts about a world through the use of a numeric code.

This world creation process applies only to the single most important and most travelled world in a star system; additional planets in a system can be created by the referee as necessary.

The basic planetary codes are Size, Atmosphere, Hydrographics, Population, Government, Law Level, Technology Level, Starport and Bases, and are

READING WORLD PROFILES Traveller describes planets using a single line of hexadecimal code. Hexadecimal codes use base 16 notation; digits 0 through 9 are represented by common numbers; digits 10 to 15 are represented by letters A through F. A is equal to 10, B equal to 11 and so on – the highest digit will F, equal to 15. In some unusual cases, further sequences of letters can also be used, such as using G as a digit to describe TL16.

Once you get used to this method of laying out the characteristics of a planet, it becomes easy to decipher during play. This is an example world:

Cogri 0101 CA6A643-9 N Ri Wa A

The first component is the name : Cogri

The second component (the four digit number) is its hex location on a sector map. : 0101

The next string of digits denote, in order:

- Starport quality : C
- Size : A
- Atmosphere type : 6
- Hydrographic percentage : A
- Population : 6
- Government type : 4
- Law Level : 3
- Tech Level : 9

The next component marks any bases present on the world – examples include N for Naval Base and S for Scout Base. : N

This is followed by any Trade codes for the planet. Cogri is a rich waterworld : RI WA

The Travel Zone for the system is last; A = Amber Zone, R = Red Zone. If no code is given then the world is either unclassified or a Green Zone : A

generated using 2D each, with DMs applied based upon the results of other codes. These codes establish the basic identity of a world, as shown in Reading World Profiles. Additional information can be created and should be, to more fully describe a world.

When creating worlds, a subsector table containing world name, location, profiles and other basic data should be compiled. This should be available to Travellers who journey through the subsector and is assumed to be routinely available information. In addition, the referee should create other information that may be pertinent. This may include details of other planets in the star system, radiation emissions from the star, types of terrain present on the planetary surface, unique encounter tables, data on flora and fauna, industrial or agricultural capacity, social structure and government, and possibly actual maps of the planetary surface.

Creating an entire universe is a fun process and can be as detailed as you like!

SIZE The Size code for worlds ranges from 0 to 10 and is determined by rolling 2D-2. Size measures a world's diameter in thousands of kilometers and the bigger a planet, the higher its gravity. The values for gravity in the Size table assume that the world has a density similar to that of Earth. Worlds like gas giants have a lower gravity than their size would indicate, while extremely dense worlds would have a higher gravity.

Intelligent species (sophonts) are unlikely to evolve naturally on worlds smaller than Size 4 or 5. Larger planets tend to imply larger populations, as there is more room for expansion.

CHARTED SPACE: ROUTES AND JUMPS In the Charted Space universe, communication and trade routes are classified by the type of jump drive necessary to travel them. This is simply because of refuelling issues – few starships carry enough fuel to make multiple jumps in succession, so they must make sure to jump only to systems where they can refuel; either to a starport or a system with a gas giant or water-bearing worlds where unrefined fuel can be skimmed.

A jump-1 route has a starport or gas giant in every hex, a jump-2 route has at least one one-hex 'gap' between refuelling points (either an empty hex or one without a starport or gas giant), while a jump-3 route has at least one two-hex gap and so on. In this way, a ship's captain will know that any route classified at less than or equal to their ship's jump capability can be travelled with no risk of becoming stranded in deep space.

Size

Size Diameter Example

Surface Gravity (Gs)
| 0 | Less than 1000km | Asteroid, orbitalcomplex Negligible |
| 1 | 1,600km Triton 0.05 |
| 2 | 3,200km Luna, Europa 0.15 |
| 3 | 4,800km Mercury, Ganymede 0.25 |
| 4 | 6,400km Mars 0.35 |
| 5 | 8,000km 0.45 |

| 8 | 12,800km Earth 1.0 |
| 9 | 14,400km 1.25 |
| 10 | (A) 16,000km 1.4 |

Worlds of Size 1 or less are asteroids, planetoids, orbital complexes, space stations and other small satellites, and much too small to retain a breathable atmosphere. They are uninhabitable by most forms of life without technological support.

HIGH & LOW GRAVITY WORLDS Worlds where the gravity is 0.7G or less (Size 6 or less) are low gravity worlds. Common features include improbable-looking rock formations, thin and spindly life forms and flying as a common form of locomotion (assuming the atmosphere is thick enough to support flyers). The effect on Travellers is detailed on page 80.

High-gravity worlds have a gravity of 1.4G or more. They tend to be extremely dense worlds; common features include wide rocky plains, squat, muscular creatures and plant life that spreads out like lichen instead of growing up. Crawling, burrowing or swimming are the most common forms of locomotion. The effect on Travellers is detailed on page 80.

ATMOSPHERE The Atmosphere code measures the type of atmosphere present. A planet's Atmosphere is generated by rolling 2D-7 and adding the planet's Size. Consult the Atmosphere table for specifics.

ATMOSPHERE TYPES Tainted: Tainted atmospheres contain some element harmful to humans, such as an unusually high proportion of carbon dioxide. A Traveller who breathes a tainted atmosphere without a filter will suffer 1D damage every few minutes (or potentially hours, depending on the level of taint), in addition to any other effects.

Exotic: An exotic atmosphere is unbreathable by humans but not otherwise hazardous. A Traveller needs an air supply to breath in an exotic atmosphere without suffocating.

Corrosive: Corrosive atmospheres are highly dangerous. A Traveller who breathes in a corrosive atmosphere will suffer 1D damage each round.

Insidious: An insidious atmosphere is like a corrosive one but is so potent that it attacks equipment as well. The chief danger in an insidious atmosphere is that the toxic gases will destroy the seals and filters on the Traveller's protective gear. An insidious atmosphere worms its way past protection after 2D hours on average, although vigilant maintenance or advanced protective gear can prolong survival times.

Very Dense: These worlds have thick N 2 /O 2 atmospheres but their mean surface pressure is too high to support unprotected human life (high pressure nitrogen and oxygen are deadly to humans). However, pressure naturally decreases with increasing altitude, so if there are highlands at the right altitude the pressure may drop enough to support human life. Alternatively, there may not be any topography high enough for humans to inhabit, necessitating floating gravitic or dirigible habitats or sealed habitats on the surface.

Low: The opposite of a Very Dense atmosphere, these massive worlds have thin N 2 /O 2 atmospheres that settle in the lowlands and depressions and are only

WORLD TEMPERATURE A planet's surface temperature is primarily dependent on its distance from its primary star (how much solar radiation it receives) and how thick its atmosphere is (how much of this heat it can retain). The habitable zone is the area around a star most conducive to the development of Earth-like, habitable worlds and it is assumed that most colonized worlds will be in this habitable zone. Roll 2D for the planet's temperature, applying the DMs listed below for the Temperature table:

Atmosphere 0 or 1: No modifiers, but temperature swings from roasting during the day to frozen at night. Atmosphere 2 or 3: DM-2 Atmosphere 4, 5 or E: DM-1 Atmosphere 6 or 7: DM+0 Atmosphere 8 or 9: DM+1 Atmosphere A, D or F: DM+2 Atmosphere B or C: DM+6

Optionally, the referee may also choose to impose one of the following:

Hot edge of Habitable Zone: DM+4 Cold edge of Habitable Zone: DM-4

Boiling 81º+ Boiling world. No ice caps, little liquid water.

breathable there – the pressure drops off so rapidly with altitude that the highest topographic points of the surface may be close to vacuum.

**Unusual:** An Unusual atmosphere is a catchall term for an atmosphere that behaves in a strange manner. Examples include ellipsoidal atmospheres, which are thin at the poles and dense at the equator; Panthalassic worlds composed of a rocky core surrounded by a water layer hundreds of kilometers thick; worlds wracked by storms so intense that local air pressure changes from dense to thin depending on the current weather and other planets with unusual and hazardous atmospheric conditions.

HYDROGRAPHICS The Hydrographic code measures the amount of surface liquid and hence the amount of dry land on the world. Hydrographic percentage goes from 0 to 10, measuring the surface liquid in increments of 10%. For normal worlds, this will be water; on other worlds with corrosive or exotic atmospheres, it could be a corrosive or exotic liquid like ammonia or methane.

Hydrographic code is obtained by rolling 2D-7 and adding the planet's Atmosphere. Some Atmospheres use the modifier below:

Size 0 or 1: Hydrographic 0 Atmosphere 0, 1, A-F: DM-4

If the planet's Atmosphere is not D or Panthalassic F (and thick enough to retain water under extreme circumstances), then you can also apply DMs for temperature:

Hot Temperature: DM-2 Boiling Temperature: DM-6

**Hydrographics**

Hydrographics

Hydrographic Percentage Description
| 0 | 0%–5% Desert world |
| 1 | 6%–15% Dry world |
| 2 | 16%–25% A few small seas |
| 3 | 26%–35% Small seas and oceans |
| 4 | 36%–45% Wet world |
| 5 | 46%–55% A large ocean |
| 6 | 56%–65% Large oceans |
| 7 | 66%–75% Earth-like world |
| 8 | 76%–85% Only a few islands and archipelagos |
| 9 | 86%–95% Almost entirely water |
| 10 | (A) 96%–100% Waterworld |

POPULATION The Population code measures the planet's intelligent population. The Population code can be generalised as the number of zeroes following a one, so Population 6 indicates a population in the millions (1,000,000).

Population is generated with 2D–2. However, the referee may like to introduce extremely high population worlds (Population B or C) at their discretion.

LOW-POPULATION WORLDS Planets with Population 3 or less are very small colonies and may differ considerably from the descriptions in the rest of this chapter. A world with Population 1 can change its Government code with an argument over dinner and is unlikely to bother with a worldwide network of communications satellites even at TL15.

If a world has Population 0, it is uninhabited and so has a Government, Law Level and Technology Level of 0.

GOVERNMENT The Government code indicates a range of possible ruling systems, determined by rolling 2D–7 and adding the planet's Population code.

The Common Contraband column on the Government table determines goods such a government is likely to restrict but should not be taken as a universal rule.

Population Population Inhabitants Range Description
| 0 | None 0 — |
| 1 | Few 1+ A tiny farmstead or a single family |
| 2 | Hundreds 100+ A village |

RIVALS, FACTIONS, CONNECTIONS & COLONIES The Government code determines the dominant government type on that planet but there are usually other factions such rival political parties, cultural groups, religions, rebels and so forth who oppose the government. Conflicts on a planet can involve the Travellers; they might be hired to smuggle weapons to a rebel group or be asked to investigate a political scandal involving a government leader.

Roll D3 to determine how many factions there are on the planet, with DM+1 if the Government is 0 or 7, and DM-1 if the Government is 10 or more. In cases where the faction code is the same as the current Government code (or similar, such as two democracies or two dictatorships), then it is a splinter faction within the ruling government. In cases where it is radically different (anarchists against a bureaucracy), then the faction is a rebel group or movement.

For each faction, use the Government table again to determine what form it takes. Then roll 2D on the Factions table below to determine the strength of each faction.

On a balkanised world there may be dozens or even hundreds of governments but they are generally divided into factions with a common ideology or identity.

Factions 2D Relative Strength 2–3 Obscure group – few have heard of them, no popular support 4–5 Fringe group – few supporters 6–7 Minor group – some supporters 8–9 Notable group – significant support, well known 10–11 Significant – nearly as powerful as government 12 Overwhelming popular support – more powerful than government

CULTURAL DIFFERENCES While colonies trace their heritage back to their mother worlds and patron governments and from then onto the ancient homeworlds of the species, every world has a measure of unique cultural drift. Spacefarers may run into bizarre customs or beliefs on different worlds. The referee should either decide how a culture has developed over the centuries or roll on the Cultural Differences table (or better yet, both – a combination of reasoned extrapolation and random strangeness produces a nicely organic-feeling culture).

Cultural Differences D66 Culture
| 11 | Sexist – one gender is considered subservient or inferior to the other. |
| 12 | Religious – culture is heavily influenced by a religion or belief systems, possibly one unique to this world. |
| 13 | Artistic – art and culture are highly prized. Aesthetic design is important in all artefacts produced on world. |
| 14 | Ritualised – social interaction and trade is highly formalised. Politeness and adherence to traditional forms is considered very important. |
| 15 | Conservative – the culture resists change and outside influences. |
| 16 | Xenophobic – the culture distrusts outsiders and alien influences. Offworlders will face considerable prejudice. |
| 21 | Taboo – a particular topic is forbidden and cannot be discussed. Travellers who unwittingly mention this topic will be ostracised. |
| 22 | Deceptive – trickery and equivocation are considered acceptable. Honesty is a sign of weakness. |
| 23 | Liberal – the culture welcomes change and offworld influence. Travellers who bring new and strange ideas will be welcomed. |
| 24 | Honorable – one's word is one's bond in the culture. Lying is both rare and despised. |
| 25 | Influenced – the culture is heavily influenced by another, neighboring world. Roll again for a cultural quirk that has been inherited from the culture. |
| 26 | Fusion – the culture is a merger of two distinct cultures. Roll again twice to determine the quirks inherited from these cultures. If the quirks are incompatible, then the culture is likely divided. |
| 31 | Barbaric – physical strength and combat prowess are highly valued in the culture. Travellers may be challenged to a fight or dismissed if they seem incapable of defending themselves. Sports tend towards the bloody and violent. |
| 32 | Remnant – the culture is a surviving remnant of a once-great and vibrant civilization, clinging to its former glory. The world is filled with crumbling ruins and every story revolves around the good old days. |
| 33 | Degenerate – the culture is falling apart and is on the brink of war or economic collapse. Violent protests are common and the social order is decaying. |
| 34 | Progressive – the culture is expanding and vibrant. Fortunes are being made in trade; science is forging bravely ahead. |
| 35 | Recovering – a recent trauma, such as a plague, war, disaster or despotic regime has left scars on the culture. |
| 36 | Nexus – members of many different cultures and species visit here. |
| 41 | Tourist Attraction – some aspect of the culture or the planet draws visitors from all over civilised space. |
| 42 | Violent – physical conflict is common, taking the form of duels, brawls or other contests. Trial by combat is a part of their judicial system. |
| 43 | Peaceful – physical conflict is almost unheard- of. The culture produces few soldiers and diplomacy reigns supreme. Forceful Travellers will be ostracised. |
| 44 | Obsessed – everyone is obsessed with or addicted to a substance, personality, act or item. This monomania pervades every aspect of the culture. |
| 45 | Fashion – fine clothing and decoration are considered vitally important in the culture. Underdressed Travellers have no standing here. |
| 46 | At war – the culture is at war, either with another planet or polity, or is troubled by terrorists or rebels. |
| 51 | Unusual Custom: Offworlders – space travellers hold a unique position in the culture's mythology or beliefs and travellers will be expected to live up to these myths. |
| 52 | Unusual Custom: Starport – the planet's starport is more than a commercial center; it might be a religious temple or be seen as highly controversial and surrounded by protestors. |
| 53 | Unusual Custom: Media – news agencies and telecommunications channels are especially strange here. Getting accurate information may be difficult. |
| 54 | Unusual Customs: Technology – the culture interacts with technology in an unusual way. Telecommunications might be banned, robots might have civil rights or cyborgs might be property. |
| 55 | Unusual Customs: Lifecycle – there might be a mandatory age of termination or anagathics might be widely used. Family units might be different, with children being raised by the state or banned in favor of cloning. |
| 56 | Unusual Customs: Social Standings – the culture has a distinct caste system. Travellers of a low social standing who do not behave appropriately will face punishment. |
| 61 | Unusual Customs: Trade – the culture has an odd attitude towards some aspect of commerce, which may interfere with trade at the spaceport. For example, merchants might expect a gift as part of a deal or some goods may only be handled by certain families. |
| 62 | Unusual Customs: Nobility – those of high social standing have a strange custom associated with them; perhaps nobles are blinded, must live in gilded cages or only serve for a single year before being exiled. |
| 63 | Unusual Customs: Sex – the culture has an unusual attitude towards intercourse and reproduction. Perhaps cloning is used instead or sex is used to seal commercial deals.  |
| 64 | Unusual Customs: Eating – food and drink occupies an unusual place in the culture. Perhaps eating is a private affair or banquets and formal dinners are seen as the highest form of politeness. |
| 65 | Unusual Customs: Travel – Travellers may be distrusted or feted, or perhaps the culture frowns on those who leave their homes. |
| 66 | Unusual Custom: Conspiracy – something strange is going on. The government is being subverted by another group or agency. |

LAW LEVEL The Law Level of a planet represents the relative force of law extant on the world. A high Law Level indicates that visitors to the world will have their activities curtailed. Law Level determines two things in particular – what it is illegal for Travellers to possess on the world and the likelihood the Travellers will run afoul of the law.

Law Level is determined by rolling 2D–7 and adding the Government code.

BANNED GOODS Different governments ban different goods. A Traveller might be able to carry their laser rifle slung over their shoulder on one world and be arrested for carrying a simple knife on the next planet over. An alien might enjoy full rights on one world and be treated as an animal on another. Banned goods are important for smuggling.

As far as Travellers are concerned, the most common restriction a government imposes is on the possession of weapons and this is reflected on the Law Level table. However, the referee might consider the stance of a government for all of the following:

Weapons: A government that bans weapons begins with restricting weapons of terror and mass destruction, then moves onto personal weapons. Governments will also often ban armor, with a view that an overly militarized appearance simply attracts trouble.

Drugs: A government that bans drugs begins with narcotics but at higher Law Levels, medicinal and anagathic drugs may also be banned.

Information: A government that seeks to control information begins by restricting the use of computers and computer programs, especially information-retrieval and information-control. At higher Law Levels, bringing data from offworld or even communicating with natives can be forbidden.

Technology: A government that bans technology seeks to shield its citizens from the influence of advanced technology.

Travellers: A ban on Travellers restricts the ability of outsiders to visit the world, confining them to the starport or forbidding landing entirely.

Psionics: Restrictions on psionics are common and most worlds ban psionics as a matter of course. On other worlds, psionics may be technically legal but there is such prejudice against it that most psionic users hide their abilities.

Law Level Law Level Weapons Banned Armor
| 0 | No restrictions – heavy armor and a handy weapon recommended... |  |
| 1 | Poison gas, explosives, undetectable weapons, WMD | Battle dress |
| 2 | Portable energy and laser weapons | Combat armor |
| 3 | Military weapons |Flak |
| 4 | Light assault weapons and submachine guns | Cloth |
| 5 | Personal concealable weapons | Mesh |
| 6 | All firearms except shotguns & stunners; carrying weapons discouraged|  |
| 7 | Shotguns|  |
| 8 | All bladed weapons, stunners| All visible armor |
|9+| All weapons| All armor

THE LAW & TRAVELLERS A planet's Law Level can be used to determine the Travellers' interactions with the law. In each of the following situations, roll 2D, add the listed modifiers and if the total is equal to or lower than the planet's Law Level, the Travellers are investigated or challenged by agents of planetary law enforcement.

Situation DM Response First approach to a planet +0 Check Offworlders wandering the streets of a city (once per day)

+0 Check

Offworlders acting suspiciously

-1 Check

Bar fight -1 Apprehended Shots fired -2 Apprehended Breaking and entering -2 Investigate Firefight involving armored Travellers and military weapons

-4 Apprehended

Murder and carnage -4 Investigate

Check: This result means the Travellers' travel documents and identities are checked, either by a police officer or guard, or electronically by querying the Travellers' comms. A successful Admin or Streetwise check can allay suspicion but if it is failed, the planetary authorities move on to Investigation.

Investigate: This results in a detective or bureaucrat probing deeper into the Travellers' backgrounds. If the Travellers have a ship, it will be searched. They may be followed or have their communications tapped. They may also be questioned closely.

Apprehended: The police show up ready for a fight. Their response will generally be proportional to the threat posed by the Travellers; if the Travellers are just making trouble in a bar, then most police forces will use batons, stunners, tranq gas and other non-lethal weapons. On the other hand, if the Travellers are in battle dress and firing PGHPs at the palace of the planetary duke, then the police will show up with the best weapons and armor available at the planet's Tech Level (or even a few levels higher), possibly with the army not far behind them.

Travellers arrested for a crime will face punishment, determined by rolling 2D+DMs on the Sentencing table.

For crimes involving smuggling banned goods, the DM is equal to the difference between the planet's Law Level and the banned goods in question (for example, laser weapons are banned at Law Level 2, so a Traveller found with a laser weapon on a Law Level 6 world would have DM+4 on the Sentencing table).

Other crimes have a set DM.

Crime DM False Identity Law Level -5 Destruction of Property Law Level -3 Assault Law Level -2 Manslaughter Law Level -1 Murder Law Level +0

A Traveller with the Advocate skill may attempt to reduce the severity of sentencing by making a check. If successful, reduce the Sentencing DM by the Effect of the check.

Sentencing

2D+DM Sentence 0 or less Dismissed or trivial  1–2 Fine of 1D x Cr1000 (per ton of contraband) 3–4 Fine of 2D x Cr5000 (per ton of contraband) 5–6 Exile or a fine of 2D x Cr10000 (per ton of contraband) 7–8 Imprisonment for 1D months or exile or fine of 2D x Cr20000 (per ton of contraband) 9–10 Imprisonment for 1D years or exile 11–12 Imprisonment for 2D years or exile 13–14 Life imprisonment 15 or more Death

A result of Exile means the Traveller must leave the planet immediately and never return.

STARPORT Starports are the arteries of interstellar commerce. These ports for spacefaring craft range in size from a landing field with a rudimentary radio beacon and hydrogen fuel still, to city-sized edifices where tens of thousands of ships land daily. Many planets have only a downport, a landing zone on the ground accessible only by entering the atmosphere. Ships that cannot land at a downport are serviced by a fleet of shuttles and other smaller vessels. Worlds advanced or rich enough may possess a highport, an orbiting starport. Some are equipped with space elevators or even gravitic lifts connecting highport to downport.

Starports are classed from A to E. To determine the level of a starport on a planet, roll 2D and apply these DMs to the Starport Class table:

DM+1 if the planet's Population is 8-9 DM+2 if the planet's Population is 10+ DM–1 if the planet's Population is 3-4 DM–2 if the planet's Population is 2–

Quality: This determines both the condition of the port itself and the level of competence of the staff. Quality may vary – it is possible to find a Class D port run by expert engineers or a Class A that has succumbed to decay. Some worlds have entirely inappropriate starports; a world that was once a center of commerce but has now been bypassed by new trade routes, might have a cavernous port capable of handling thousands of freighters now almost abandoned.

A frontier installation is just a bare spot of bedrock, marked with a beacon, and is a starport in the most technical sense only.

Berthing Cost: This is the price paid by any ship that wants to land or dock at the starport and is due weekly. Prices can vary wildly between starports but tend to remain stable at each (roll once for each starport and record it for future reference).

Fuel: This refers to the fuel available for purchase – either refined or unrefined. Refined fuel costs Cr500 per ton; unrefined fuel costs Cr100 per ton but is risky to use when jumping. Bases have their own fuel-refining ability – see Bases on page 259.

Facilities: These are the starport's repair and construction ability. A shipyard allows for the construction of new vessels. A shipyard capable of building all types of ships can construct small craft (less than 100 tons), spacecraft (100 to 5,000 tons) and capital ships (more than 5,000 tons). However only a Class A starport can construct jump-capable spacecraft.

Repair facilities allow a damaged ship to be repaired and have plenty of spare parts for most common systems.

Limited repair facilities can only fix Hull damage.

Use the following modifiers when determining whether a highport is present: DM+1 if TL9–11, DM+2 if TL 12+, DM+1 if Population 9+, DM–1 if Population 6–

Use the following modifiers when determining whether a corsair base is present: DM+2 if Law Level 0, DM–2 if Law Level 2+.

Bases: This lists what sort of bases may be present. Roll 2D for each base type listed; for more details, see Bases on page 259.

TECH LEVEL The Tech Level of the planet is determined by rolling 1D and adding DMs from the Tech Level table.

The Tech Level measures the average technology presence on the planet and gives an idea of local production and repair capability. Trade with offworlders may bring in advanced technology; on average, a rich individual can afford technology two or more levels higher than the planetary average. The government may also have access to higher-technology items.

A planet's technology may be one or more levels higher or lower in a particular field, such as Medicine, Communications, Weaponry, Ship Construction, Power Generation, Computers and so forth.

COMMUNICATIONS If the planet is below Tech Level 3, then there will be no telecommunication system whatsoever except for whatever facilities the starport offers. If it is between TL4 and TL6, then it has radio and telephone communications between major cities at least but

CHARTED SPACE: STARPORTS AND THE LAW Technically, a starport is Imperial territory and not under the jurisdiction of the planetary government. The local government may share in the construction costs, running costs and profits of the starport but the port is extraterritorial and run by an Imperium-appointed governor. This means that Travellers can carry locally illegal goods onto a planet so long as they do not leave the starport. It also means that criminals and refugees often claim sanctuary in a starport and that a starport's Tech Level may be considerably higher than that of the rest of the planet. Starports operate according to Imperial Law
(equivalent to Law Level 1 for most items and forbidding all use of psionics).

However, Travellers should be aware that not every world honors this approach and paranoid governments have been known to forcibly board and inspect ships to root out what they see as unpleasant influences.

no satellite facilities. From TL7 onwards, the planet has a progressively more advanced communications grid. At TL9, it is accessible from every point of the surface (communications satellites become cheap and easy to deploy).

**ENVIRONMENTAL LIMITS** Certain Atmospheres require a minimal Tech Level. A world can have a Tech Level lower than this limit but the population cannot maintain or repair their life support systems and are likely doomed.

BASES In addition to the basic facilities at a starport, there may be one or more special bases at the starport or nearby in the system. These are the common types of bases but others are also possible, such as prison facilities, naval shipyards, alien embassies or consulates and

other secret operations. Some are specific to the Charted Space universe but their equivalents could be found almost anywhere.

Corsair Base (C): Popularized by Vargr, corsair bases do not have the full range of facilities as naval bases but provide enough to refuel and maintain corsair ships. A corsair base is often the main staging point from which raids are conducted.

Depot (D): Used by the Imperium's sector fleets, a depot is a massive naval base, often consuming an entire star system. It can support a sizeable fraction of a sector fleet's ships at once, offering building, repairing, rearming and experimental facilities. As well as servicing ships, depots also have command and control facilities, academies and mothballed ships.

Military Base (M): These are planetary facilities for the support, maintenance, repair and refit of ground vehicles and troops.

Naval (N): A naval base is a supply depot, refuelling station, repair yard or fortress of either the Imperial Navy or the local sector navy. Naval vessels can obtain refined fuel and supplies here. Naval bases are always guarded by armed vessels and fixed defence. Ex-Naval Travellers may meet Contacts or Allies here and mercenary Travellers can try to pick up work. Naval bases also have an advanced hospital, although it is normally available only to naval personnel. Travellers may also be able to purchase navy-surplus weapons here.

Scout (S): A scout base offers refined fuel and supplies to scout ships (including retired scout ships obtained by retired scouts). They are also an excellent place to pick up rumors and news.

Way Station (W): A large Imperial Interstellar Scout Service installation dedicated to the x-boat communication network and servicing scout ships.

TRAVEL CODES There are two travel codes in the Charted Space universe – Amber and Red – although other universes may have equivalent classifications. An Amber world has been deemed dangerous by the Imperium and Travellers are warned to be on their guard. Amber worlds are often undergoing upheaval or revolution, or else are naturally hazardous environments.

Red worlds are interdicted and travel to them is forbidden. A world might be Red because the Imperium wishes to preserve it or because the world is too dangerous to allow visitors. Interdictions are enforced by the Imperial Navy.

A world with Atmosphere 10+, a Government 0, 7 or 10 and Law Level 0 or 9+ should be considered for Amber status. Red codes are applied at the discretion of the referee.

TRADE CODES Trade codes designate particular types of worlds and the types of goods likely to be found there. If a world meets all requirements listed for one or more Trade codes, it gains those classifications. Trade codes are used extensively in the Trade chapter.

**Agricultural (Ag):** Dedicated to farming and food production. Often, they are divided into vast semi- feudal estates.
**Asteroids (As):** Usually mining colonies but can also be orbital factories or colonies.
**Barren (Ba):** Uncolonized and empty.
**Desert (De):** Dry and barely habitable.
**Fluid Oceans (Fl):** Worlds where the surface liquid is something other than water and so are incompatible with Earth-derived life.
**Garden (Ga):** Worlds that are Earth-like.
**High Population (Hi):** A population in the billions.

High Tech (Ht): Among the most technologically advanced in Charted Space. Ice-Capped (Ic): Worlds that have most of their surface liquid frozen in polar ice caps and are cold and dry. Industrial (In): Dominated by factories and cities. Low Population (Lo): A population of only a few thousand or less. Low Tech (Lt): Pre-industrial and cannot produce advanced goods. Non-Agricultural (Na): Too dry or barren to support their populations using conventional food production. Non-Industrial (Ni): Too low in population to maintain an extensive industrial base. Poor (Po): Lacking resources, viable land or sufficient population to be anything other than marginal colonies. Rich (Ri): Blessed with a stable government and viable biosphere, making them economic powerhouses. Vacuum (Va): No atmosphere. Water World (Wa): Almost entirely water-ocean across their surface.
