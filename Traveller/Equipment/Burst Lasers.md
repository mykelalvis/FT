# BURST LASERS

Aimed as a midpoint between pulse and beam lasers, burst lasers are a rapid-firing turret weapon that have gained some popularity with the Trojan Reach and beyond. Using smaller but more numerous capacitors designed to be charged and discharged in quick succession, the burst laser can fill an area of space with powerful but short-lived laser beams.
