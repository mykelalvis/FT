'Gerbil' was the medic, gunner and general Mr. Fix-it on the Crimson Folly for several years, until his addiction to Yixter got the best of him. He absconded with Cr 178,540, and has spent almost all of it on his habit. Gerbil is aggressive and verbally abusive, virtually shrieking his demands, and threatening to have the authorities lock everyone up. When first seen, he will be in the manic phase that follows awakening from a Yixter coma. Gerbil has been consistently using Yixter for 3 months. He will, if given any opportunity, commit sabotage or other acts designed to distract or cause confusion, and in the resulting chaos, he will attempt to locate and steal cash or salable valuables to feed his Yixter habit. He wears the dagger like a short sword, his snub pistol in a shoulder rig, and is clothed in an extensive pink muumuu-like robe.
