## THE ECOLOGY OF ADAN

Adan is located in a cluster of star systems that link the rich industrial worlds of the Saregon subsector and the economically depressed Chanestin Cluster of Dunea. Adanian civilization was brought to its knees by the ravages of the Long Night. Its remnant culture had nearly died out 1,500 years ago when it was recontacted by the Chanestin Kingdom, a mere two parsecs away. The kingdom provided aid to its struggling population and established colonies on the planet. The descendants of the remnant and Chanestin populations make up the majority of Adan's people in modern times.

Adan has an unusual ecosphere. It has a single sea - called the Cleft – that fills a deep horizontal gash near the equator. The Cleft is fed by porous aquifers that cycle in nutrient-rich water, enabling it to host thousands of microbial species and primordial plant life. The majority of its flora are algae, seaweeds and other water-bound plants but the world also hosts a variety of land-based plant life that extends from the shores of the Cleft when Adan's stars shine overhead.

Most desert and near-desert worlds like Adan have difficulty establishing much more than a thin atmosphere. A large portion of a planet's breathable atmosphere is generated by photosynthesising oceanic plant life. Oceans also provide a portion of a planet's albedo, which reflects light and radiation, enabling it to retain atmosphere. Worlds with little to no hydrosphere are therefore at a distinct disadvantage when it comes to developing and maintaining standard, breathable atmospheres. Adan defies the odds with the help of the Clench, a massive bramble of adaptive seaweed, coastal ivies, vines and other plant life that extend themselves thousands of kilometers from the Cleft, far into the surrounding deserts. These perennial life forms contribute to Adan's atmosphere by photosynthesising oxygen and exuding a dusky pollen, which spreads out over much of the planet. The pollen would be capable of seeding additional plant life but fails to do so in Adan's arid deserts where conditions are less than optimal. However, the pollen does have the fortuitous side effect of adding to the planet's albedo and reflecting light and radiation, which might otherwise burn away the atmosphere.

A single day on Adan is approximately 44 standard days long. Its axial tilt is slight, so most of the planet experiences a consistent climate. The Clench grows when Adan's binary pair – Metalhava, an orange main sequence star, and Olauvi, its red dwarf companion- shines upon it and recedes when night descends.

Technically, day and night are each 22 standard days long but Adanians do not measure it that way. Numin is 26 standard days long and begins as the light of dawn first touches upon the eastern portion of the Cleft, causing the Clench to begin growing. As light reaches the central portion of the Cleft, the eastern Clench attains its maximum size, extending approximately 1,000 kilometers from the coast and covering about three million square kilometers. Meanwhile, the western Clench has already begun to gather and bustle along the west coast, preparing for its mad dash into the desert. By the time the dawn light shines upon the western shore of the Cleft, the western Clench has already reached half its maximum size, growing at a rate of 5–10 kilometers per hour, its progress clearly visible to the naked eye. At its longest reach, the western Clench extends nearly 3,000 kilometers into the desert, covering approximately 6.3 million square kilometers as the stars shine brightly overhead. While the eastern and western Clenches cover a scant 3.6%
of the surface of Adan at their apexes, the industrious plants photosynthesise enough oxygen for the world to maintain a standard atmosphere. Numin ends as Metalhava and Olauvi disappear over the western horizon and Tarashu, the night consisting of 18 standard days, descends upon the region around the Cleft, where the vast majority of Adanians live.

Numin is hot, ranging from 26° Celsius at dawn, reaching 55° when the binary pair shines directly overhead. Tarashu is cold, reaching depths of -6o, which would be worse if not for warm convection winds that blow in from the desert. Numin is the busy season for Adanians. They harvest crops from dozens of Clench species during this time. There is precious little arable land along the Cleft but clever farmers have found ways to cultivate fast-growing crops with what resources they have. After the harvest and approach of Tarashu, the processing begins at factories for sale and distribution to Adanian citizenry. Surpluses are sold as exports to visiting merchants at the downport. Among the most popular of these are the many varietals of bramblewine, edible cactus apples, rich and durable fibres and exotic pigments extracted from colourful floral blooms.

Harvesting the Clench is a tricky business. The best crops are extracted from deep within its rapidly advancing brambles and tangles, which grow anywhere from one to 50 meters high, in some cases completely blocking out the light of the twin suns. For centuries, the harvest has claimed its share of sacrifices, farmers and pickers who become lost in the floral maze or trapped by vines and tendrils. In more recent times, Adanians have enlisted members of the Community to assist them with the harvest. Clairvoyants are used to predict the flow of the Clench and identify safe entrances and exits from its myriad pathways. Telepaths find lost pickers and lead rescue parties to free them, including telekinetics whose talents enable them to reach into the brambles to lift or extract victims. There are even a few psions whose abilities enable them to redirect the growth path of the plants. In spite of the propaganda and stories that everyone hears about psions, most Adanians have come to quietly appreciate the contributions of the Community.
