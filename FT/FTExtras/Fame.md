Fame works like [[Physique]] or [[Will]] for your notoriety.  There exists a stress track for [[Fame]] exactly like your physical and mental stress tracks.  In this way, it is somewhat different from the extra [[Social Standing]] in that the track works precisely like a more concrete skill.

Fame will not be attractive to most characters, and the Fame stress track is _really_ only important for characters whose fame or infamy is essential to their nature.  If you want to live a life where your Fame does not rule your existence, then keep your [[Fame]] skill at +0.

The [[Fame]] skill is a bit of a counterpart to [[Social Standing]], representing the character's fame (or infamy) and ability to be recognized or such.  It is the counterpoint to being unnoticed.

![[oc_r.svg|30 ]][[Overcome]]: You can use [[Fame]] to [overcome any obstacles](../four-actions/index.html) that require the application of being famouse---most often to overcome a [[situation aspect]] of a social nature.

![[adv_r.svg|30 ]][[Create Advantage]]: [[Fame]] has a lot of potential for advantages in social conflict, usually related to smearing an opponent's name or building up an ally.

![[att_r.svg|30 ]][[Attack]]: [[Fame]] may be used to directly harm the Fame stress track.

![[def_r.svg|30]][[Defend]]: You may use [[Fame]] to provide active opposition to someone else's social attack on your fame or that of someone lse.

**Special**: The [[Fame]] skill gives you additional Fame [stress or consequence slots](../stress-consequences/index.html). Average (+1) or Fair (+2) gives you a 3-point stress box. Good (+3) or Great (+4) gives you a 3-point and a 4-point stress box. Superb (+5)and above give you an additional mild consequence slot along with the additional stress boxes. This slot can only be used for harm visited on your noteriety.

## The Nature of Fame

Fame is fickle.  The more you have of it, the harder it is to keep.  You must continue to do things that make you famous in order for Fame to remain unaltered.  In this vein, the more famous your are, the more likely that injury will make you equally _infamous_.  If you're the Dread Pirate Bobby, that might be OK.  But if you're a Knight of the Realm and a famous explorer, it might be a bad thing.

Fame is also double-edged.  While it can be an assistance to various forms of social interations, a character's [[Fame]] score is applied as a negative modifier to any attempts at subterfuge _that does not capitalize on that fame_.  This means most [[Deceive]], [[Provoke]], and [[Rapport]] rolls,  and even some [[Profession]]s.  Also, _half_ of your [[Fame]] score is applied as a positive modifier to [[Notice]] attempts for anyone looking for you, unless you are specifically countering it.  Famous people are just easier to spot.

Finally, fame creates envy.  Famous characters will be more subject to attacks of all sorts, not just Fame stress.  

## Healing Fame Stress and Consequences

This is more role-played than anything else.  Several different sources may start the recovery process.  "Mild" slights disappear at the end of the scene, as with mental harm.  But consequences might take a bit longer and require special work..

For instance, for legal battles [[Profession]]:Advocate could be used.  For governmental troubles, [[Profession]]:Bureaucrat.  For salacious issues, public relations might be the way.

Finally, [[Fame]] can assist in managing [[Social Standing]] stress (and vice versa).  However, to do so runs the risk of having the "assistance" backfire, injuring one or both tracks.
