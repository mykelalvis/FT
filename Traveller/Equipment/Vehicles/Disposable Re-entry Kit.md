Sometimes referred to as the 'poor man's escape pod', disposable re-entry kits are a suitable backup tool for jump troops who do not have access to a reentry capsule or other means of conducting an orbital assault. The kit consists of an ablative shield, harness, stabilizer tripod, lightweight chemical thrust adjuster and basic flight computer, all of which are disposable. The ablative shield is made of a polymer foam that absorbs heat during re-entry. At higher Tech Levels, the material becomes more durable and reliable. The flight computer is attached to the stabilizer and assists the user with adjustments during descent. The harness buckles the user in for the ride.

The user supplies their own vacc suit, combat armor, battle dress or other vacuum-sealed environment suit with a life support system. Users must make certain they have enough air in their tanks for the drop. The denser the atmosphere, the longer the duration of the descent.

Some kits include a parachute that deploys once a suitable atmosphere is present. Others require the user to bring an appropriate in-atmosphere locomotion system; for example, a chemical rocket pack or grav belt. Disposable re-entry kits are popular with extreme sports enthusiasts, some of whom hold drop competitions in which time to landing, landing zone accuracy and other factors are scored.

#### Making a drop with a portable re-entry kit

Difficult (10+) Flyer (any) check (variable timeframe, DEX). The timeframe varies with atmosphere type. If the Atmosphere code is 5 or below, it is 2D x 10 minutes; if 6–7, it is D3 hours; and if 8–9 it is D6 hours to complete the drop. The Referee may adjust the drop difficulty to account for other factors. For example, if the Traveller is dropping into a region in which a tropical storm is brewing, the in-atmosphere portion of the drop might warrant a higher level of difficulty.
