### Makhidkarun

Makhidkarun produces luxury goods and items of great sophistication such as data processing equipment and robots. It is active all over the sector but maintains a major facility on Vincennes, where the megacorporation develops next-generation communications equipment and robotics. A subsidiary operates some of the most prestigious liners in the sector, which act as travelling showrooms for the very latest in top-end electronics, robotics and luxury goods.

Makhidkarun is one of three Megacorporations (Naasirka and
Sharurshid being the others) that have their origins in the First
Imperium. None was exactly a corporation during that period; they
were termed 'Bureaus', each of which was responsible for overseeing
a part of the Ziru Sirka. Economic activity was one of the key means
by which the Vilani Imperium maintained its control over subject
worlds, so the Bureaus were heavily involved in trade, commerce
and industry.
Although the Bureaus were very similar in function and composition,
each had unique characteristics which influenced its development
during the primacy of the Vilani Imperium and in the centuries
since. Each of the bureaus was based on one of the three powerful
groups in traditional Vilani society: the aristocracy, the merchants
and the Shugili. The latter were experts in food production, and were
vital to human survival on Vland as virtually every potential food
item required extensive preparation to make it edible.

Makhidkarun was established by the aristocracy and was particularly
interested in governance. Today this is reflected in its status as the
premier supplier of luxury goods such as wines and gourmet foods.
The communications division deals mainly in data processing
equipment and data itself; particularly entertainment and art.
Makhidkarun also supplies electronics and computer equipment
to the Imperial armed forces and operates an assetâ€“management
service.
