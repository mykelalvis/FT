Doing business in the Imperium can be highly profitable. With a few aberrations, its history has been one long steady climb to wealth and prosperity. Built upon the twin pillars of free trade and self-defense, with little in the way of laws or regulations to guide the actions of individual worlds or the companies that do business on them, the environment is ideal for competition. The few regulatory agencies that do exist are there primarily to ensure that corporations do not violate Imperial law or sovereignty.

Most corporations of the Imperium are restricted to a single world or small number of worlds within a few parsecs of each other. Very successful corporations can dominate the market in a large expanse of a sector or sometimes the entire sector. Only a precious few corporations can be said to be pan-Imperial. These are known as the megacorporations.

Megacorporations are truly massive in scope, with offices, factories, research-and-development facilities and administration centres spread throughout Imperial space and often beyond its borders. Most are run like any other company, including corporate officers, boards of directors and multiple levels of management. The main difference is that these companies cover such a broad area that top executives are only responsible for strategic decisions and long-term planning with the bulk of day-to-day decisions made by regional managers who are empowered at the level of a chief executive officer at smaller corporations. The distance between branch offices and the time required for communication necessitates this level of autonomy.

Megacorporate operations are so diverse and widespread that subsidiaries may find themselves inadvertently competing with each other. Sometimes this is even desirable if doing so adversely affects a competitor in another market. Megacorporations are exorbitantly wealthy, with capital and assets distributed throughout Imperial space. Most are simply too large to be traded on a single exchange; therefore, their stock is divided into regional financial centres with overall value published on an intermittent basis, limited by the speed of interstellar communications. Data is carried in encrypted storage blocks on the x-boat network but most of the megacorporations maintain [[Intell-class Courier|courier]] fleets to carry more sensitive data.

The oldest megacorporations are the three dominant Vilani bureaux: Makhidkarun, Sharurshid and Naasirka. In the Ziru Sirka era, the bureaux were responsible for the governance of vast regions of space. Naasirka governed its spinward sectors, Sharurshid the trailing sectors and Makhidkarun dominated the coreward region of the empire. The central region and various tributaries were run by a mix of the three along with smaller contenders. After the fall of the Ziru Sirka, the bureaux were gradually transformed into bona fide megacorporations, each with a massive sphere of influence and accumulated wealth.

###### THE MEGACORPORATIONS

While local commercial and industrial activity is important, especially
that of the high–technology industrialized worlds, a very significant
chunk of the funds that go into the Imperial treasury comes from
mulitworld corporations. Some of these are sufficiently enormous
as to be referred to as Megacorporations.

The Megacorps have holdings on dozens or hundreds of worlds
across the Imperium. Most are diversified in terms of activity as
well as location, with interests in shipping, manufacturing, banking,
research and other critical areas. The Megacorporations wield far
more power than any given world government and in many cases
could literally buy out a government if that seemed desirable.

Conflicts of interest between the Megacorps and world governments,
or between different corporations, are inevitable from time to time.
Outright trade wars have been fought between corporate assets,
which include mercenary security forces and sometimes armed
starships.

The Megacorporations wield enormous power due to their wealth
and control of critical industries, and for another reason too. Many
of the great nobles of the Imperium are shareholders or officers of
the Megacorporations. This is hardly surprising as the Imperium
was founded by a businessman and of its original nobility was
made up of his allies and supporters. The Imperium is built upon
economic activity, and many its leaders are captains of industry.

This can create conflicts of interest, and there are laws to limit how
far a corporate noble can favor his own and his economic allies'
interests. However, the simple fact is that money and power go
together, and the Megacorporations have both in large quantities.

There are 13 Megacorporations within the Imperium, plus many
more huge corporate entities. All are entitled to use the suffix 'LIC',
which stands for Limited–liability Imperial Charter and designates
corporate status. However, some corporations use a different suffix
for stylistic or historical reasons. For example GSb uses the ancient
[[Terra|Terran]] suffix AG to remind all and sundry of its claim to have been
founded long before the Third Imperium.

Some Megacorporations have their regional headquarters at the
domain, sector and subsector capitals; others use a similar system
of tiers but maintain their bases elsewhere. It is not usually worth
the trouble and cost of setting up a regional headquarters on some
outsystem rockball, though there are security benefits for doing so.
Most Megacorps have their offices at worlds that are major trade
hubs, though there are exceptions. For example, if a corp owns a lot
of interstellar shipping it may be worth setting up a private starport
to house both the regional headquarters and maintenance yards.

There is no overall policy; Megacorporations tend to do what works
best in the circumstances and will adapt to local conditions.
