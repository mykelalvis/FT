# INTRODUCTION


This adventure takes place on the world of Mithril, in
Sword Worlds subsector of the Spinward Marches.
It could be transplanted elsewhere without undue
difficulty, with Mithril replaced by any cold, low-
population frontier world. The mission requires the
use of a starship to reach Mithril but once there the
Travellers will require only ground transportation.


Mission to Mithril is in part homage to the Classic
Traveller adventure, Mission on Mithril , and in some
ways a sequel. No previous knowledge of that
adventure is required. Almost any group of Travellers
will be suitable for this adventure, although outdoors
skills such as Recon and Survival will be highly useful,
as will the ability to drive an ATV and fight.


In Mission on Mithril , the Travellers land at Mithril’s
rudimentary starport, only to find their vessel disabled.
The base is strangely empty. As the Travellers explore,
they discover there may be survivors of whatever


happened at the port. A distant distress beacon is
detected but reaching it requires an overland trek.
Having located the survivors, the Travellers discover
their problems are only just beginning...

SETTING UP AND RUNNING


THE ADVENTURE
The Travellers require a reason to go to Mithril. More
than likely, the Travellers will be making a routine
stopover on the way to somewhere more interesting.
The reason for the visit is not relevant to the adventure,
so the Referee has plenty of options if this adventure is
being inserted into an ongoing campaign. If the Referee
desires, the Travellers might be given a cargo to deliver
to somewhere that requires passing through Mithril.
All that is necessary is for the Travellers to approach
what passes for a starport on Mithril, at which point the
events of the adventure will begin to unfold.

# REFEREE'S INFORMATION

The following information is for the use of the Referee. How
much of it is made available to the Travellers and in what
manner, is for the Referee to decide. Much of this data
is commonly known or available through data terminals,
info feeds to Travellers’ comms and so forth. However, the
commonly available version may be incomplete, dumbed-
down or wildly inaccurate for all manner of reasons. The
Referee has the whole story; if the Travellers want accurate
information they may have to search for it.

SWORD WORLDS SUBSECTOR
This subsector is dominated by the Sword Worlds
Confederation, with only a handful of worlds not belonging
to the Confederation. These are Imperial possessions,
some separated from Imperial territory by Confederation
systems. The generally anti-Imperial stance of the
Confederation, along with its rather vigorous internal
politics, creates an uneasy border region.

Four systems (Iron, Bronze, Mithril and Steel) are
claimed by the Sword Worlds Confederation as ‘reserve
worlds’ but are not members of the Confederation
as they have no indigenous population. Largely
undeveloped and unexplored, the reserve worlds
have a token Sword Worlder presence and are
occasionally patrolled by naval vessels. Attitudes to
Imperial starships, which sometimes pass through
from Lunion subsector to District 268 or Five Sisters,
vary considerably depending on which factions are
in power within the Sword Worlds. Polite hostility is
not uncommon and it is rare that Imperial visitors feel
welcome on any Confederation world.

However, despite being on opposite sides in the
occasional war, the Sword Worlds and Imperium
are not enemies. Tension is normal, incidents not
uncommon, but for the most part conflict is restricted
to harassment of merchant vessels and a general
policy of making outsiders feel unwelcome. As a
result, there is little Imperial traffic into or through the
Sword Worlds subsector, apart from a few shipping
companies who have the right contacts on both sides of
the border. Some merchant factors (in both the Sword
Worlds Confederation and Imperium) are actively on


the lookout for crews willing to undertake trans-border
work. In reality it is not risky but many captains consider
any possibility of harassment to be too much.


The Sword Worlds Confederation itself is a very loose
organisation, with its member worlds frequently at
odds (and sometimes even at war) with one another.
Naval and military assets encountered, especially
around the reserve worlds, tend to be in service to the
Confederation as a whole rather than any of its member
states but even so they are on loan from one of those
states and thus as embroiled in its politics as anyone
else. It is not always possible to predict exactly what the
attitude of a given ship captain or port director might be.


MITHRIL
Mithril is a cold but habitable world orbiting an F4 V star
along with six terrestrial (rocky) planets and one gas giant.
No other bodies in the system are known to be inhabited
and Mithril itself has no official population although it
does have a small Sword Worlds Confederation outpost
maintained mainly to assert territorial rights.


Mithril’s surface is largely covered with ice. Its extensive
oceans are frozen at the poles, with large ice caps
and have other areas which are at most semi-liquid.
Nearer the equator the water is a little above freezing
but icebergs are not uncommon in any region. Similarly,
much of the land is also covered in deep snow or ice.


Travellers tend to evolve shorthand that conveys
necessary information. Often vague, generally
unscientific and sometimes quite insulting, many of
these terms have nonetheless found their way into
common speech and whilst planetologists may cringe
at the terms, Travellers find them useful. The terrain of
Mithril is generally subdivided into four unofficial types.


Arctic Zones: Some areas of Mithril are permanently
under arctic conditions. Their seas support a variety of
plant life, fish, crustaceans and the like, with a few land-
dwelling species, but for the most part the extensive
arctic zones of Mithril have very little life on land.


Ice Zones: Ice zones are subject to thick ice, covering land
or sea. Occasionally, conditions warm up sufficiently that
the ice breaks up creating crevasses, icebergs and other
hazards but ice zones are very rarely clear of ice – and
never for long. Some ice zones are extensive; others, such
as glaciers, are relatively small. Ice zones tend to have
more life on land than arctic zones, due to the availability of
food under the ice or in more hospitable nearby regions.

**Snow Zones:** Snow zones are warm enough that
plants can grow, at least for short periods. Snowfall is
frequent and snow can lie deeply at times. The ground
may be frozen much of the time, although there are
sheltered areas that remain above freezing more or
less permanently. Thick ice can be encountered in a
snow zone but it is not the primary terrain.

**Rock Zone:** Mountains, badlands and areas where there
are significant amounts of bare rock are imaginatively
known as rock zones. Temperature conditions can vary,
which will determine whether there is much life present.
Many rocky areas have a considerable amount of plant
life, especially on the sheltered sides of mountains or in
gaps between large boulders.


THE SWORD WORLDER OUTPOST
Mithril is officially designated as possessing a Class E
starport – little more than a marked landing area. This
is accurate but the presence of the outpost provides
visiting starships with minimal services if the staff are
friendly to them. Sword Worlder vessels are usually
welcome, as well as some independent trade ships
that pass through from time-to-time. Imperial-registered
ships are generally directed to the system’s gas giant
for refuelling or granted grudging permission to land
and take on water and ice, to be internally converted to
fuel. These vessels are then pointedly ignored.


Some Imperial ships receive a warmer welcome at
Mithril, usually due to previously-established good
relations or possession of a transponder code that
indicates a friendly vessel. There is little trade to be
had at Mithril; at least, not in the volumes that keep
a starship flying. However, the outpost staff will buy
small luxuries and items, so there is sometimes a
little money to be made.


#### MITHRIL

UWP: E568000-

Referee's Information


The outpost consists of an administration building,
reactor shed, accommodation block and vehicle garage.
It can house up to 12 people with ease but normally
has a staff of five. They are bored most of the time, with
little more to do than to bulldoze snow off the landing
area in the ATV and monitor automated equipment on
the off-chance a vessel comes through. The staff have
secondary duties connected with weather monitoring
and collecting data on Mithril’s soil, water, air and wildlife.
This is mostly scientific make-work, creating a body of
knowledge that might some day be useful to settlers or
colony planners but is of little importance today.

The outpost is not a military base, although the
personnel assigned there are armed and trained to
handle their weapons. The installation is sovereign
Sword Worlds Confederation territory (as is the whole
planet) and an attack upon it would be an act of war.
One reason for the refusal to accept many ships is that
the outpost is simply not in a position to conduct much
business with outsiders, especially badly behaved
ones. It is simpler to shut the doors than enforce any
sort of law and order, and less disruptive of routine.

Occasionally the outpost plays host to people not
assigned there, usually a party of scientists or
explorers engaged in work connected with the eventual
colonisation of Mithril. It is very rare for two such groups
to be on-planet at the same time, so the spare capacity
of the accommodation block usually suffices. At present,
the installation is hosting a family of four visitors. The
parents are explorers and their children are assisting
them. This party conducted a range of weather and soil
experiments at the port during the first few weeks of their
stay and recently headed into a remote part of the planet
to investigate points of interest.

THE INCIDENT
There is, or rather was, another guest at the port. This
individual came on a ship out of the Imperium and quietly
disembarked, remaining unofficially at the port to await
a ship to any port deeper in the Confederation. He did
not tell the port staff his business and they did not ask as
he was carrying the identification of a diplomatic courier.
The fact that a courier was crossing the border quietly
suggested skulduggery was afoot but the port staff had
seen this sort of thing before and were not concerned.

Perhaps they should have been. The courier was indeed
what they suspected; an intelligence officer bringing back
reports and observations from his time in the Imperium.
There was nothing illegal about any of this, not as such.
Discreet observation of conditions along the border are


part of the constant intelligence and counter-intelligence
game played by the Imperium and its neighbours. Part of
the game is not letting the opposition know what has been
reported and what has not, so information is often carried
by personnel crossing the border ‘on the quiet’.


The courier was carrying reports on the movement
of Imperial commercial and naval assets among the
worlds of the Lunion Shield; the strategically critical
star systems just across the border. Knowing whether
the Imperium is in a position to defend its assets in
that region, and what assets are present, is vital to the
Sword Worlders’ strategic planning. The Imperials do
the same thing to the Confederation, after all.


The Imperial authorities did not know about this courier
and would not have cared much if they had. Disrupting
information flow to the opposition is always worthwhile
but there was nothing going on worth taking risks over.
However, not everyone thought so. Ironically, it was not
the Imperial authorities that detected the information
transfer but a consortium of merchants engaged in shady
trans-border shipping. Worried that their activities might
be brought to light, they decided to intercept the courier.


The first attempt failed but caused the courier to miss his
pickup by a routine resupply ship coming through Mithril.
Arriving after it left and forced to wait for the next ship,
he was still present when an independent far trader – the
E-a-taka Wasab, registered out of Tarsus in District 268.
Despite being named in the language of the Bwaps,
E-a-taka Wasab was crewed by humans. She was not
known at the port, so was brusquely directed to stick a
hose in the snow for fuel and subsequently ignored.


E-a-taka Wasab refuelled then blasted the front doors off
the accommodation block with a low-powered shot from
her laser turret. Armed personnel stormed the installation,
catching the three Sword Worlders and courier who were
present by surprise; the Sword Worlders put up a creditable
fight but were quickly overwhelmed and shown no mercy.
The wounded courier was taken aboard the ship along with
his data and notes, and E-a-taka Wasab took off.


One of the Sword Worlders at the installation had a
background in military electronics and had been working
on a personal project to alleviate the boredom of her
posting. This was an electromagnetic pulse device
designed specifically to disrupt gravitic lifters of the sort
used by vehicles and starships. She managed to arm the
device before she was killed but its setup sequence was
incomplete when E-a-taka Wasab left Mithril. The device
is now armed and charged, with no-one to turn it off. It will
be triggered by the first set of gravitic lifters that pass over
the landing field; i.e. the next starship that touches down.

TRAVELLER


THE SURVIVORS
Two of the base personnel were out in the field at the time
of the attack, assigned to assist the family of scientists
currently on-planet. This mostly meant flying them around
in the installation’s air/raft or making supply runs back
to the port. They were far enough away when the attack
occurred that they were not detected and upon hearing a
distress call from the port, they attempted to rush back to
help. This went awry in two ways.


The family were opposed to being abandoned in the
field and argued vigorously against the idea, to the
point where the father came to blows with one of
the base personnel. In the resulting chaos, he made
a serious piloting error and ran the air/raft into a
rocky outcrop on takeoff. Believing it still flyable, the
two Sword Worlders raced homewards to help their
comrades, only to come down hard in a region of rocky
hills. They are still alive, although injured.


The family are also still alive, although they are stuck in
the far outback of a world whose human population was
more or less halved by gunshots at the port. They are
resourceful people, and trying to survive as best they
can, but there is a limit to how long they will manage in
the harsh conditions of Mithril.

IMPERIAL ATTITUDES


TO SWORD WORLDERS
The attitude of many Imperial citizens to the Sword
Worlders is one of unintentional prejudice. This is fed by
entertainment shows that keep re-using various rather
inaccurate tropes when they portray the Sword Worlders.
As a result, many Imperials expect Sword Worlders to
behave like sexist cartoon Vikings, in some cases down
to the horned helmets and mead-filled drinking horns.


In reality, the Sword Worlders are proud of and heavily
influenced by the spiritual roots of their culture, which
is based on the values of archaic North Europeans
and particularly Icelandic culture. Resourcefulness,
independence and personal integrity are highly valued
and there are stronger concepts of male and female
roles than in most other starfaring societies (the Aslan
are a notable and far more extreme example). Sword
Worlder culture holds that males and females are
disposed towards different strengths and this natural
order of things creates a strong partnership that
should not be lightly ignored.


Put simply, to the average Sword Worlder it is obvious
that men should undertake most tasks that take place
outside the home and that women should run the
household. Since the men must live in that household,
there are various opinions about who actually wields
the power in Sword Worlder society. The typical Sword
Worlder finds it questionable that men from other
cultures do not take ‘proper care’ of their women,
and try to force them into roles unnatural for them.
The more egalitarian Imperials see this viewpoint as
archaic, chauvinistic and rather silly.


Sword Worlders do not see themselves as sexist and
resent the label. They feel that each person has a
natural role that plays to their strengths, as determined
by gender, and that this is not sexist; it is merely
common sense. Many Imperials think this means
women are second-class citizens in Sword Worlder
society and are surprised to see strong women working
alongside men in many fields.


The other common expectation is partially true. Sword
Worlders do tend to have an accent, even when
speaking Anglic, and are prone to use traditional
figures of speech which supposedly come from ancient
Icelandic or Norse sayings. However, it is far more
common for a Sword Worlder to refer to a starship as a
starship than a ‘mighty star-steed’, although some play
to that stereotype just for the fun of it.


Some stereotypes are true, at least to a degree. Sword
Worlders are, on the whole, proud and independent.
They enjoy competition and relish the respect of those
they feel are worthy of their own. Complaining all
the time, being incompetent or cowardly are seen as
personality defects as well as weaknesses but stupid
recklessness is also poorly regarded. Sword Worlders
are mistrustful of over-complexity in devices or plans,
preferring straightforward solutions.


Ease of use is more important than advanced
functionality, causing many Sword Worlders to dismiss
fragile and complex devices as unreliable – and have
little respect for those who rely upon them. This attitude
can be summed up as ‘grav vehicles beat walking but the
passenger who doesn’t bring along their boots is a fool.’


Overall, most Imperials first discover the Sword Worlders
are a lot more like them than they imagined, then over
time realise that there are indeed some great differences
between Sword World and Imperium culture. A common
reaction to first encounters with Sword Worlders is ‘I was
surprised to find they’re just like us... then I found out
they’re not. But not in the ways you’d expect.’

Referee's Information


# OVERVIEW

_Mission to Mithril_ has three main components; an
investigation of the deserted starport, an arduous
overland trek to the site of a distress beacon and the
return to the starport. The adventure is very much about
the interaction of the Travellers with the world around
them; they must undertake an overland journey and this
is one case where the journey is more important than
arrival. Along the way, the Travellers must solve a variety
of problems, few of which can be dealt with by bribery
or gunplay. For much of the adventure, there is no-one
outside the Travellers’ group to interact with.

The Referee has a chance to show the Travellers the
wonders of an alien world – and some of its dangers. It
could be possible to reduce the journey to a series of
checks but this would miss many of the opportunities
for adventure along the way. The Travellers have a
destination to reach, and may be impatient to do so, but
there is a world to be experienced. The obstacles are
not delays to be shoved aside with the right check; they
_are_ the adventure.


Eventually the Travellers will reach the beacon and find
out at least some of what happened at the starport. They
will also discover that critical components they need
to fix their starship are available but must be found by
locating a crashed air/raft. This leads the Travellers to
the second group of survivors, after which they will need
to return to the starport. The journey back will be slightly
different to the outward trip as it involves interactions
with the survivors, which may not all be amicable.


Travellers being what they are, it is likely that
the Referee will be presented with all manner of
unexpected incidents and self-inflicted setbacks. The
main opposition to the Travellers is a harsh world
where stupidity or bad luck can be fatal. On the other
hand, these conditions have led to some unique local
plants, creatures and phenomena which might spark
the Travellers’ interest and it might be that finding out
more about Mithril becomes a priority for the Travellers.
The Referee should not fall into the trap of letting the
Travellers dash from one encounter or plot point to the
next in the manner of a flow chart. Instead, the Referee
should show the Travellers the world they are on and
let them experience it up close and personal.

# CONDITIONS ON MITHRIL


Mithril is not a friendly or welcoming world, although it is
nothing like as hostile as the typical airless rockball or
toxic-atmosphere moon. To survive on Mithril, humans
need heat and food, neither of which the world supplies
in any great quantity but they have air and water provided
for them. There are far worse places to be marooned.


The equatorial area of Mithril, where the starport is
located, is mostly a snow zone, with large areas of
rock zones and some ice zones, mostly in the form of
glaciers. There is also a fair amount of open sea, most
of which is clear of pack ice. Large icebergs can still be
encountered there, however.


Conditions in the equatorial area can be harsh but
nowhere near as bad as elsewhere. The temperature
sometimes goes above freezing for several days at
a time, which results in an explosion of plant growth.
Animals usually emerge soon afterward, cramming
what might normally be months’ or years’ worth of
activity into a few short days.


Rainfall is rare in the equatorial area, although sleet is
almost as common as snow. Hailstorms are not infrequent
and occasionally the region will be swept by tremendous
storms characterised by huge hailstones and repeated
lightning strikes. A Traveller equipped with good cold
weather clothing can operate outdoors for an extended
period with only mild discomfort, providing somewhere
warm and dry is available, with plenty of food.


The plant and animal life of Mithril is at best unpleasant
to eat and can make some Travellers mildly unwell.
There is little nutrition to be gained from plant life,
even when processed into ration bars or porridge by
a survival still. Animals and fish provide a little more
sustenance, if carefully prepared or processed, but
overall a human cannot survive for long by hunting or
foraging, even in an area with relatively abundant life.


WEATHER
Weather in the equatorial area is moderate compared to
the arctic zones, where freezing windstorms can blow for
weeks on end. Extremes of weather – storms at one end
and warm conditions at the other – are uncommon, with
most days cloudy and sleet or snow falling at intervals
throughout the day. A weather category is used to
indicate the prevailing conditions on any given day.


Warm: The temperature is well above freezing, around
4–8oC. Rarely, a hot spell takes the temperature above
10 oC but this is short-lived and only occurs once every
couple of years. During a warm period, there will be
some melting of thinner ice but these conditions rarely
last long enough to affect thick pack ice. During a warm
spell, the phenomenon of the Ephemeral Glade (see
page 69) is likely to take place. Warm days are quite
overcast, and may see some rain or sleet.


Cool: Cool conditions would be considered cold on
most planets but for Mithril any day above freezing is
a good one. On a cool day, the temperature typically
hovers around 0–4oC. An Ephemeral Glade is possible
in areas with thin snow cover and snowfall or hail is
also likely but intermittent.


Cold: The average temperature in Mithril’s equatorial zone
is around -10oC. A cold day sees temperatures around this
average, ranging a few degrees either side. Snowfall or hail
is common, and can last for several hours.


Very Cold: Very cold for Mithril means temperatures in the
-20oC to -40oC range, averaging around -30oC. This is too
cold for much snowfall unless a storm blows it into the area.


Extremely Cold: Extremely cold refers to temperatures
of -50oC and below. These conditions are uncommon in
the equatorial area but near-constant in arctic regions.
Snowfall is unlikely unless a storm moves it but strong
winds are common and can carry small ice particles
which are deposited on any surface they strike.

10


STORMS AND PRECIPITATION
Storms can occur in any temperature conditions. To
determine the possibility of a storm, the Referee should
roll 2D, adding DM+1 for every day since the last
major storm. A result of 7+ indicates there is significant
precipitation that day (rain in a warm period, sleet or
hail if cool, snow or hail if colder conditions prevail). A
result of 13+ indicates a serious storm.

A storm will last 2D hours and is characterised by
strong gusty winds that blow snow into deep drifts,
driving hail or snow, and heavy precipitation that
reduces visibility to almost nothing. Driving in these
conditions is inadvisable – an ATV can be blown
sideways on ice and might even be tipped over by an
extreme gust. Moving around outside on foot is also
highly dangerous. There is a one in six chance that the
storm will be accompanied by spectacular lightning.

To determine the weather conditions each day, the Referee
should throw 2D and consult the Weather Conditions table.


Weather Conditions
2D Result
2 or less Extremely Cold
3–5 Very Cold
6–9 Cold
10–11 Cool
12+ Warm


Apply the following DMs:
Snow Zone: Ignore all other DMs
Ice Zone: -
Arctic Zone: -
Storm Occurred Yesterday: -


It is possible for the temperature to suddenly rise by more
than one category. This is accompanied by thawing and
cracking of surface ice which can make conditions even
more hazardous. A large change the other way makes a
storm likely; roll 2D, on 8+ a storm occurs the next day.

Conditions on Mithril


# MITHRIL DOWNPORT


Nothing seems out of the ordinary as the Travellers’
ship approaches Mithril Downport. There is no
message of welcome, just an automated beacon
informing incoming vessels that they are permitted to
land at the port but not granted clearance to enter the
installation or travel on the planetary surface. Vessels
can take on fuel by melting snow and those who want
anything else are advised to file a request with the port
director’s automated message system. If the Travellers
do this, they get an automatic response but no action,
for reasons that will soon become apparent.


Mithril is predominantly grey-white, as far as the eye
can see, and the Travellers may be moved to speculate
that perhaps this is the origin of its name. The port is in
a Snow Zone, so depending on the temperature there
might be anything from a light dusting to a metre-deep
pack of snow with huge drifts. The sky overhead is
cloudy with the threat of yet more snow.


As the Travellers make their landing, some may note
there are no signs of life at the port installation, although
there is power; lights are on and a dish rotates endlessly
on the roof. Looking more closely, the Travellers realise
there is something odd about one of the four buildings.
Its outer snow-screen, a light framework designed to
stop snow drifting in front of its entrance, is in place
making it difficult to see the actual doors but it becomes
clear the screen is damaged. Heat scoring suggests
intense energy, such as a laser weapon.


Before the Travellers can act upon this information, the
ship’s instruments spike and it drops the last metre onto
the landing field, hitting hard and shaking the Travellers
up. Loose objects tumble to the floor and for a moment
the lights go dim. Any attempt to take off again fails; the
ship’s drive and lifters are simply not responding.


FIRST IMPRESSIONS
The Travellers’ ship has suffered damage but it is
mostly cosmetic. Lighter fittings may be dented and
anything not properly secured has at least been
rearranged. The landing gear has taken a pounding but
should have been able to withstand the shock. All the
same, it needs inspection. Power and most significant
functions are still online, although there are signs that
an overload has occurred and fried a few circuits. The
only system with critical damage is the drive.


Inspection of the drive reveals the control circuits are
intact and working but the gravitic lifters and drive are
inoperable. The fault is presumably within the systems
themselves, necessitating a crawl into the inspection
spaces. There, an ominous smell of burning circuitry leads
to the gravitic systems’ governor circuits. All of them have
been overloaded by a power surge generated by feedback
in the gravitic lifters themselves. Something like this could
happen in one system because of malfunction – although
that is still very unlikely – but for every single governor to be
overloaded at once there must be an outside cause.


A replay of sensor data from the landing indicates there
was an electromagnetic pulse just as the ship touched
down. It was on a narrow frequency and apparently
designed specifically to interfere with gravitic systems.
The pulse originated somewhere nearby but it is not
possible to pin down the precise location.


There are no footprints or signs of vehicles, starships or
any other form of traffic to and from the port installation
but it has snowed recently which would cover any
tracks. Nobody is moving in the port; the Travellers do
not seem to be under attack.


The damage is not repairable with the equipment and
spares the Travellers have to hand. They are stuck on the
landing pad until they repair their ship or another vessel
comes by. The latter might not be for weeks. The only
course of action seems to be to investigate the downport.


INVESTIGATING THE DOWNPORT
The port installation consists of four buildings with a
perimeter fence around them. It is not clear what the
fence is designed to keep out; it is a simple wire barrier
without barbs or heavy posts, and seems to have been
erected mainly to delineate the installation. There is no
gate, just a gap wide enough to drive a couple of ATVs
through side-by-side. A road of sorts runs the short
distance from the landing pad to the installation and about
150 metres past before stopping abruptly. Whatever the
road was intended to lead to was never built; today there
is a large pit near the end of it, which is used to dispose of
large objects that would otherwise clutter the installation.
The road is of the same crushed-and-fused stone as the
landing pad, a common building material used by most
advanced cultures throughout Charted Space.

The installation consists of four drab, blocky buildings
with thick windows covered by storm shutters, all
closed. Doors are equally thick and well insulated, and
protected by an overhang of the roof with a light fabric
snow screen extending to the ground.

At the time the Travellers land, there is a small fire
burning within the reactor building and an alarm sounds
for a few minutes as the fire suppression system is
activated. The installation is silent and without mains
power for about four minutes after the EMP device
goes off, after which the reactor automatically comes
back online. The Travellers might be too busy with their
own problems to notice this.


THE VEHICLE GARAGE
This is a windowless brick-shaped structure with a
large access door on the front and smaller personnel
entrance at the side nearest the accommodation block.
The doors are shut and it is in darkness but the lights
will come on automatically if someone enters. The
building has a heating system, which is run at low level
just to keep the vehicles from freezing up.


The garage has a cradle for an air/raft – the vehicle is
not present – and an all-terrain vehicle is parked beside
it. The ATV (see page 84) is functional and unlocked.
The keys – actually a data storage device with a finger
grip, giving the impression of a key – are in the driver’s
access slot. Clearly the installation staff preferred to be
able to use the vehicle at a moment’s notice rather than
having it secure. The Travellers may wonder why but
there is no big secret here – the ATV was mainly used
as a bulldozer to clear snow from the landing area.

Mithril Downport


TRAVELLER


Anyone with a background in starship engineering or
grav vehicle operations will realise that an air/raft has
similar governor circuitry to a starship, just less of it.
Finding the missing air/raft will enable the Travellers to
get their ship off the ground and back to a port where a
full set of spares is available.


Racks at the back of the garage contain maintenance
tools for the ATV, along with an assortment of manual
tools such as snow shovels. Most are in their racks and
have seen little use.


There are no signs of combat within the garage; the
attackers merely made sure the building was empty.


THE REACTOR SHED
The reactor ‘shed’ is a very solid building with thick
walls and no windows. It has a single entrance, a heavy
door which is closed. Within is a compact fusion reactor
adapted from a standard Sword Worlder design that
normally powers small starships. The reactor’s fuel
reserves are contained in a series of large tanks under
the landing pad, connected by underground pipes. These
tanks also provide fuel to passing starships and contain
enough processed fuel to run the reactor for years.


Additional fuel is normally obtained by way of smaller
pipes running out from the landing pad to artificially
constructed dips in the ground. These are not obvious
when covered with snow but will show up on thermal
sensors as warm spots. Slight heating in these areas,
caused by low-powered dispersed elements, causes
melting snow to run down the dip and be collected in a
small tank just underground. It is then pumped through
the purifier (also under the landing area) and stored
as liquid hydrogen ready for use. In periods of high
demand, often additional snow could be bulldozed onto
the collection points and heated more quickly to create a
considerable volume of water which is then cracked into
hydrogen and oxygen, but this has never been needed.


The reactor shed contains a small electronics workshop,
which is in complete disarray. It looks like it has been
ransacked but investigation will reveal it has merely been
used to store, dismantle and fiddle with every piece of
scrap electronics the base staff could find. This took place
over a lengthy period and there are several parts of half-
built devices lying around. It was here that the EMP device
was constructed and the presence of several heavy-duty
coils, all of them misaligned or damaged in some way,
will give a clue that someone was building some kind of
electromagnetic device if a Difficult (10+) Electronics or
Average (8+) Engineer check (INT) is made.


By the time the Travellers enter the reactor shed, it is
likely that the power will be back on and the fire out. It was
caused by the detonation of the EMP device which has
crippled the Travellers’ gravitic lifters. The remains of the
device itself can be found in a corner of the electronics
workshop. Its detonation was electromagnetic rather than
explosive, and has not caused a blast effect, but it did
become hot enough to melt itself and cause the small
fire. The EMP affected the reactor only a little, causing a
short shutdown and automatic reset, but has destroyed
nearby electronics. None of the civilian electronic devices
under repair in the workshop are salvageable but shielded
electronics will be untouched.


THE ADMINISTRATION BUILDING
The administration building follows the same general
design as the other structures; thick-walled and blocky.
There is a small vestibule, intended to reduce heat
loss and provide somewhere to leave outdoor clothing.
Beyond the entryway, the building contains four offices,
two of which look like they have rarely if ever been
used, a communications suite, an administrative centre
with far too many desks for such a small installation
and two secure storage areas.


The Vestibule is a small chamber with racks for coats
and a couple of snow shovels. It would be unremarkable
under most circumstances but there is a lingering smell
of solvent-based cleaning products and an odd reddish
stain here and there. It appears that someone has
cleaned up quite a lot of blood here and there are a
couple of bullets embedded in the row of parkas hanging
down the wall. They are too flattened to identify.


The Offices are very small, with little more than a
workstation and a few shelves. One was routinely used
by the port warden and another by whoever was on
duty when he was not. The other two have only been
used occasionally. The port’s records are intact and can
be accessed from any of these terminals but require an
authorisation code. If the Travellers can hack the terminals
with a Very Difficult (12+) Electronics (computers) check
(2D x 10 minutes, INT), they will be able to view the (very
sparse) shipping records for the past few months. The last
visitor to the port was the far trader E-a-taka Wasab. Before
that, subsidised merchant Jinfrei came through a couple of
weeks previously and three weeks earlier a Sword Worlder
vessel designated only Supply Run 4-14 called at the port.


Appended notes indicate Jinfrei makes a semi-regular
run from Zaibon to Caladbolg by way of the reserve
worlds and is a friendly vessel – i.e. her crew interact
with the port staff. On this trip, one of her passengers
disembarked and remained at the downport. There is
no indication as to this person’s identity.

14

Mithril Downport


Similarly, Supply Run 4-14 has an appended note that
supplies were delivered and four personnel remained at
the port. These were Eric and Myntelle Bothildr, noted to
be explorer-scientists, and their children Egino and Runa.

**The Admin Centre** is the largest space in the building
and clearly intended to house a full port staff. A double
row of desks has been pushed together down the
middle of the chamber and is strewn with outdoor
clothing plus several sets of what appear to be home-
made skis formed out of resilient plastic. From the
cracks, the experiment does not seem to have been a
success. There is another stain, much like the one in
the vestibule, in the doorway to the communications
centre and the walls are pockmarked by a considerable
number of bullet holes.

**The Communications Centre** is a small room jammed
full of electronics. Most of the downport’s systems are
still functional, although the data storage cores of the
comms system have been removed.

**The Secure Storage Chambers** were used to house
an armoury and a home-made still. There are racks for
a dozen longarms and the same number of pistols but
no sign of any weapons or ammunition. Some webbing,
cleaning equipment and so forth remain, suggesting the
armoury was looted. Likewise, only a couple of bottles
of home-made hooch remain.

**THE ACCOMMODATION BLOCK**
The door to the accommodation block has received a
hit from a laser weapon and it is obvious this has been
deliberately concealed by lowering the snow screen.
The accommodation block has a small entrance
vestibule leading into a main chamber, which is used
for dining, meetings and recreation, along with 12
individual accommodation chambers, a kitchen and its
associated storage area, and two configurable areas in
use as a lounge and gym.

**The Main Chamber** , like that in the administration
block, was the scene of a brief but vicious gunfight.
Numerous bulletholes in the furniture and chips out
of the walls indicate well over 100 rounds fired. Most
casings have been cleared up but a few were missed.
They come from Sword Worlder smallarms and generic
weapons common along the frontier, as well as within
the Imperium. The central dining table was overturned
as a barricade and is riddled with bullets. A large stain
has been cleaned up behind the table.


The Kitchen and storage area are well equipped with
gadgets and can turn out meals for well over 20 people
at once. Large stocks of food remain, with perishable
items in cold storage. The kitchens have not been
unduly disturbed except for the cleaning products,
which have been ransacked.


The Configurable Chambers are currently set
up as a lounge and a gym. They are untidy but
otherwise not disturbed.


The Accommodation Rooms are small and basic.
Indeed, they are slightly inferior to those aboard a
second-rate commercial starship. A couple have been
used as ‘junk rooms’ where various items have been
dumped – notably a large number of holed, torn and
otherwise damaged pieces of outdoor clothing. Another
contains various basic medical supplies, most of which
is in cases that have at some time been opened to deal
with a minor emergency.


It is obvious that six of the chambers were in recent
use. Five of these have clothing and personal items
belonging to a mixed male/female crew, in varying
degrees of tidiness. They have been cursorily searched
and notably lack items like jewellery, personal
electronics and any form of cash.


The other room will remind the Travellers of a starship
cabin used by someone who dislikes to pack and unpack.
A few items have been placed on shelves or hangars
but it appears occupant lived out of his bags. These are
missing, as is the occupant, although there is a blood trail
leading to this chamber from the central one. It has been
thoroughly doused in some solvent-based cleaner.


THE PIT
At the end of the road is the downport’s refuse pit.
It has been used for many years to dispose of large
items that would otherwise create obstacles. The
original snow-clearance vehicle, having finally given
up the ghost, was dumped in here along with various
broken tables and fittings. There are signs that
something has burned in the pit, although anyone
climbing in will run the risk of being cut or even
impaled by twisted metal. There are three burned
bodies, along with clothing and personal identification,
in the pit. They were doused pretty thoroughly before
being burned and identification is impossible.

TRAVELLER


EVENTS AT THE DOWNPORT
The Travellers may be able to piece together what
happened here. After refuelling their ship (in case a
quick getaway was needed), the attackers disembarked
and moved towards the administration building. Two
of the base staff were outside and, in accordance with
standing orders, they were armed whilst foreigners
were present. These two were fired upon, resulting
in a running fight across the installation. One made it
to the accommodation complex where he joined the
base’s other visitor – the intelligence officer – inside.
They sealed the door, only to see it shot away by the
ship’s laser. They made a last stand in which the staff
member was killed. The intelligence officer attempted to
retreat into the living chambers but collapsed from his
wounds and was captured.


The other Sword Worlder was separated from her
colleague and entered the reactor shed. There, she
attempted to arm her experimental EMP device in the
hope it would cripple the attacker’ ship, after which she
slipped back out and began trying to get around the
attackers and into the admin building. She was eventually
killed somewhere between the reactor shed and her
destination in an exchange of gunfire that killed or
wounded at least one of the attackers. It would be hard
to find the location in the snow but a thaw would reveal
numerous cartridge cases and discarded magazines.


Meanwhile, the installation commander attempted to
defend the entrance to the administration building,
wounding some of the attackers, and fell back to the
central chamber. He finally attempted to destroy the
communications logs and code data in the comms room,
but was killed before he could reach the data cores.


The attackers burned the bodies of the three staff and
attempted to clean up or at least degrade blood spills
in the hope it would not be obvious who was dead and
who had been captured. Their goal was the intelligence
officer and they have him along with the installation’s
(not very valuable) comms data. Subsequent events
concerning this individual are beyond the scope of this
adventure but the incident may well increase tensions
along the Imperium/Sword Worlds border.


THE CURIOUS SILENCE IS BROKEN
The Travellers may be expecting some deadly alien
threat to have overwhelmed Mithril Starport and might
engage in a ‘bug hunt’ looking for a lurking monster.
There is none to be found, although there are clues
as to what happened here. The fact that sometimes
there is no monster waiting to leap out at the Travellers
will keep them guessing next time they encounter a
deserted outpost or drifting alien wreck...


However, the Referee should not allow the Travellers
to wander around the downport for too long. They may
become bored and aimless, especially since they are
stuck there. Instead, the Referee should allow the
Travellers time to collect any clues, then introduce the
next element of the story. This comes when the port’s
automated systems, or those of the Travellers’ ship,
pick up a weak and distant signal.


The signal is nothing more than a repeater beacon, of
a sort used by distressed colonists and starfarers. It
conveys no information except a location and appeal
for assistance. There is no reply to any attempt to
contact the operators of the beacon.


If the Travellers ignore the beacon, sooner or later a
ship will come through the starport and they will be able
to get assistance. Of course, if this is a Sword Worlder
ship (which is likely) they will have to explain where the
port crew are and why they ignored a distress beacon.
That might lead to further complications.


The best solution might be to respond to the beacon.
The Travellers’ ship will not fly and there is no answer on
the radio, so the only option is to take the port’s ATV (or
any ground vehicle the Travellers’ have on board their
ship – remember, any grav vehicles they have will also
be inoperable) and drive to the signal site. The ATV’s
communications equipment is powerful enough to reach
the starport if any ships come in whilst the Travellers are
en route; they are in no danger of missing the chance to
get help by investigating the beacon.

Mithril Downport


# OVERLAND

The distress call is emanating from a point around 2,
kilometres to the west of the starport. That is no great
distance in an air/raft, and a short hop for a starship, but
for a band of Travellers in an ATV it is quite a trek. Still, it
should be possible to reach and investigate the signal and
get back to the starport in less than three weeks. There
is little chance of a ship coming through in that time and
if one does the ATV’s communications suite will enable
contact to be made from anywhere on the planet.

Mithril has a 20-hour day, creating roughly 10 hours of
daylight and 10 of darkness. Driving an ATV at night is
entirely possible, although more hazardous than travelling
by day, but trying to drive around the clock would quickly
exhaust the Travellers. It is not possible to get much sleep
in a bunk aboard a vehicle crossing rough terrain.

The Travellers would therefore be best advised to
adopt a routine of travelling for most of the day, with the
occasional stop to investigate a point of interest, check out
some obstacle ahead or perhaps just to take a break.

The ATV is capable of quite high speed on open ground
but when driving on unknown terrain this is inadvisable.
On reasonably open terrain, the Travellers’ ATV can
cover about 250 kilometres per day (assuming 10 hours
of driving) on average, although at any given time the
vehicle might be moving much faster or slower than its
average speed of 25 kilometres per hour.

The Travellers’ rate of progress will depend on a
number of factors, including terrain, obstacles, weather
and a willingness to take risks. The nominal speed
of 250 kilometres per day assumes the Travellers
are cautious and gives them a good chance to spot
anything of interest along the way. Groups who insist
on travelling faster may run right into a problem before
they have a chance to spot it, or could drive straight
past something of importance. The rate of travel affects
the chance of a mishap along the way (see page 67).

Each day, or each significant segment of a day if the
Travellers enter different terrain or some other change
in circumstances occurs, the Travellers should indicate
how fast they intend to travel.


Normal Travel: The nominal speed of the ATV is, as
already noted, an average of 25 kilometres per hour.
At this speed, the primary focus is on covering ground
rather than exploring. The Travellers are unlikely to
notice anything but the most obvious features. Chances
of an event, incident or mishap are normal.


Travelling Fast: Maintaining a high average speed
and approaching obstacles with little reconnaissance or
forethought is risky but allows the ATV to proceed 20%
faster; i.e. an average speed of 30 kilometres per hour.
Chances of a mishap are higher.


Reckless Driving: If the Travellers are in a real hurry
they can take risks and charge through obstacles that
others would normally go around. Driving recklessly is
100% faster than normal travel (50 kilometres per hour
on average) but incurs significant risks.


Proceeding Cautiously: Moving more slowly reduces
the chance of a mishap and increases the chances of
spotting something interesting along the way. Speed is
reduced by 20% to 20 kilometres per hour on average.


Exploring: Moving very slowly and weaving about to
investigate anything interesting from the ATV, sometimes
dismounting to take a closer look, reduces movement
speed by about 40%, i.e. the Travellers proceed at an
average of 15 kilometres per hour. Exploring does not
just mean looking for points of interest, it also results in
being very cautious about obstacles and hazards. This
greatly reduces the chance of a mishap.


Driving at Night: Other than making it hard to get any
sleep in the ATV’s bunks, driving at night also increases the
chance of a mishap. Speed is reduced by about 20% if a
full set of instruments, including radar and thermal imaging
is available (the ATV’s sensors include these instruments).
If using lights alone, speed is reduced by 50%.


TERRAIN
Terrain also plays an important part in determining
movement speed and the possibility of a mishap.


Ice: Ice is the predominant terrain in arctic and ice zones,
and can sometimes be encountered in a snow zone. Solid
ice that has not been thawed and refrozen is stable and

relatively smooth, allowing progress up to 50% faster than
normal without increasing the chances of a mishap.

**Broken Ice:** Broken ice may have rock projecting through
it or littering its surface and may also be very uneven due
to thawing and refreezing. Crevasses and similar hazards
are not uncommon. Broken ice can be traversed at
normal speed but the chances of a mishap are greater.

**Plains:** The flat lands of a snow zone may be covered in
shallow snow which will not impede the ATV’s progress.
Snow cover will conceal dips and watercourses, which
can result in sudden lurches or even a plunge into a
shallow lake through thin ice. Plains may also have a fair
amount of vegetation, although this is low and hardy and
does little more than to conceal the nature of the terrain.
Plains can be navigated at normal speed.

**Snow Plains:** Snow plains are simply plains covered in
deep snow, necessitating the ATV using its dozer blade
and pushing through. Snow plains slow the ATV by 50%
and may conceal hazards that require backtracking or
present themselves too late to be avoided.

**Broken Terrain:** Rock zones may be characterised
by tumbled boulders and sharp-edged outcroppings.
Sudden dips and small cliffs are not uncommon. Speed
is reduced by 25% and hazards are more likely.

**Mountains:** Minor hills are not much of an obstacle for the
ATV and can be considered the equivalent of plains for
most purposes so long as the Travellers take easier routes
through valleys and over saddles rather than trying to drive
over peaks. A tougher route through hills can be treated as
broken terrain. Mountains, however, tend to be tough going
for an ATV. Speed is reduced by 90% unless an easy route
through a valley can be found, in which case the reduction
is 50%. Even using a known pass can be tricky; the ATV
will need to struggle over obstacles and occasionally
backtrack. Mishaps and incidents are quite likely.

**Mithril Taiga:** Some areas of Mithril, notably sheltered
areas in the lee of hills or mountains, have an equivalent
to Terra’s taiga forests. On Mithril this takes the form
of low, scrubby and thorny bushes which are almost
impenetrable to an ATV and difficult to find a path through
even on foot. The taiga regions have more animal life,
but have been little explored. Taiga will snarl up an ATV
within a few metres, requiring hours of work to free it.
Travellers on foot can make slow progress or cut a path
into the vegetation to create shelter but anyone trying to
get anywhere needs to go around this obstacle.

**Seacoast or Lake:** Shores and shallow water can be
navigated easily enough and are treated as plains or


snow plains depending upon conditions. The ATV can
drive through lakes and calm rivers without hazard or
drive over frozen ones. Thin ice, i.e. which is forming or
melting, is more of a hazard as the vehicle might break
through and become stuck.


Open Water: Attempting to navigate the open sea in a
ground vehicle is hazardous. If the water is calm, the ATV
can make headway at about 2.5 kilometres per hour, i.e.
around a 10th of normal offroad land speed. Strong winds
or currents will take the ATV wherever they will, typically in
a westwards and towards-the-equator direction. A storm
will be a horrible experience for everyone aboard and will
almost certainly injure or even kill the occupants if the
ATV is rolled over but the vehicle itself will stay afloat and
ultimately survive to be washed up somewhere.


OTHER FACTORS
Offroad driving in rough terrain is physically and
mentally tiring and even driving on a flat ice plain
causes fatigue – largely due to monotony. Drivers
should be changed every two hours and not drive
more than a quarter of any given day/night cycle.
Players who roleplay this rather than just dismounting
to investigate something of interest when it arises
are entitled to some slight leniency on the part of the
Referee if they hit a major problem as they will be less
tired and stressed than those who insisted on the ‘iron
man’ approach to overland travel.


MISHAPS AND INCIDENTS
Each day the Travellers are driving or are otherwise
outside the downport, the Referee should determine if
an incident or mishap occurs. This is a straight check
on 2D, with a base chance of an incident determined by
the local terrain, as shown on the Mishap table.


The question may arise as to who is driving at the time
an incident potentially occurs. This can be determined
randomly by asking the Travellers to indicate who is
driving in each hour of the day and rolling 2D-2. This
gives a result of 0–10. A number indicates the hour
and can be matched to a driver, whilst a 0 permits the
Travellers to choose who was driving. Alternatively, if an
Average (8+) Recon or Navigation check is made the
Travellers may decide who was driving when the incident
occurred – forward planning allows them to put the best
driver in the hot seat when things look like getting tricky.


Note that many incidents occur in such a way as to
permit the Travellers to plan their approach. It is not
mandatory for the person driving the ATV when a
hazard was spotted to be the one who negotiates it.

Hidden Obstacle: The ATV encounters a previously
undetected obstacle. A Difficult (10+) Recon check will
allow the driver to halt before it is too late; otherwise the
vehicle will not be able to avoid the hazard. Backtracking
will take 2D hours. The nature of the obstacle depends
upon terrain; a deep gulley or crevasse is likely
anywhere, or perhaps an area of thin ice causes the ATV
to plunge through and become stuck.


ATV Malfunction: The ATV starts making some
alarming noises or suffering intermittent power loss.
The Referee should roll 2D to determine the severity
of the problem. The resulting number is the amount
of cumulative Effect that required on Average (8+)
Mechanic checks (INT) to fix the problem, e.g. a result


of 9 will require multiple skill checks to eventually fix the
malfunction. A check can be attempted for every hour of
work, which necessitates operating outside the vehicle.
If the Travellers choose to ignore the warning signs, the
Referee should roll 1D-2 for each hour of driving and add
the result to the existing severity. When the total reaches
12, the ATV is no longer drivable. It can be repaired in
the field requiring a Very Difficult (12+) Mechanic check
(INT) and each attempt requires an entire day of work. If
the Travellers lack the requisite skills, they may be able
to improvise a solution using their starship engineering
or scientific skills, hack the vehicle’s onboard computer
to compensate, or otherwise cleverly bypass the
problem. Any such solution is temporary.


Terrain Feature: The Travellers encounter something
unusual but not necessarily hazardous. Warm-water
geysers are possible in any terrain and create a local
warm spot that will have vegetation and some animal
life. Other possibilities are wind-carved rocks that look
almost artificial, curious snow dunes and patches
of impenetrable taiga ‘forest’, which might conceal
something of interest if the Travellers want to spend all
day hacking away to investigate.


Blocked Passage: The Travellers’ progress is blocked by
some obstacle, which might be a crevasse, thick boulder
field or blind canyon. They will have to backtrack a while
and find a way around – this takes 2D hours minus the
Effect of an Average (8+) Navigation check (INT).


Ground Subsidence: A recent thaw has weakened
the ice or created loose, possibly muddy, conditions.
Crossing this area requires a Difficult (10+) Drive
(wheel) check (DEX); failure indicates the ATV has
become stuck. Extricating it is a long process; the
Referee should roll 2D for the severity of the situation.
Getting out requires a cumulative Effect on Average
(8+) Drive (wheel) checks equal to the severity value.
A check can be made every hour, with DM+1 for every
Traveller who has found a means of helping. Once free,
the ATV is still in the middle of the hazardous area and
requires another Drive (wheel) check to get out.


Navigational Error: Having become quite lost, the
Travellers emerge from the hex they are currently in,
in a random location. Roll 1D, counting round map hex
sides from the top (north) side for their heading. This
may take them into new hazards.


EVENTS
Where incidents and mishaps can occur because of
the Travellers’ own actions – or they may get lucky
and avoid them – events are semi-scripted. That

20

Overland


is, they are applied whenever the Referee feels
appropriate. Not all of the events listed below need
occur in the course of the journey; the Referee can
choose which seem the most appropriate.

Some events are best applied when the Travellers are
stopped for some reason; whether they are camped for
the night, halted to investigate something or dealing with
a mishap. Others can be hinted at, perhaps by an odd
sensor return or a shape glimpsed through the snowfall.

Events can be spaced along both the outward and
homeward legs of the journey, with different events used
for changes of pace. The Referee should not forget that
the Travellers are operating in extremely cold conditions,
often with poor visibility. This can complicate the simplest
of tasks and make a mundane event quite deadly.

**THE ATV WRECK**
A strong sensor return leads the Travellers to a wrecked
ATV. It is a tracked vehicle, unlike the wheeled one they
are driving. It may be washed up on a shore or disabled
in a gulley. The vehicle has been stripped of everything
the crew could carry, suggesting there were survivors.
However, the wreck is very old (decades at least) and
few components remain in a salvageable state.

**THE CRATER**
The Travellers come across a large crater, presumably
the result of a large meteorite impact in the distant
past. The crater rim is around 30–40 metres high in
some places and too steep for the ATV to negotiate.
The crater is around one kilometre across and 150
metres deep at its lowest point. The crater sides shelter
the interior to some extent, resulting in a small lake of
semi-liquid water surrounded by tumbled rocks and ice.
The sides are overgrown with Mithril’s equivalent of
taiga forest and home to various small creatures.

**THE RUIN**
A strangely regular rock surface nearby turns out – if
investigated – to be a wall. It was originally part of an
octagonal building with two storeys above ground and
one below, with a minimal lighting system powered by
solar cells on the roof and not much else in the way of
amenities. The top floor has completely collapsed into
rubble and there is little left above waist height of the
middle storey. The underground segment is intact (if
rubble is cleared to access it) and contains water storage
tanks and some decayed shipping crates that once held
emergency rations and other supplies. The Travellers may
recall hearing rumours of a chain of ‘octagon shelters’
built to assist stranded starfarers but why one was built in
Sword Worlder territory is a mystery.


THE MAGNETIC ANOMALY
The ATV’s sensors record unusually strong magnetic
interference. Investigation reveals a reasonable deposit
of ferrous metal ore close to the surface. If the Travellers
choose to map the deposit and take core samples (a
process that will take a couple of hours in clear weather,
longer in heavy snowfall), they can sell the data for
Cr10000 to the Sword Worlder authorities. There are no
plans to exploit Mithril’s resources as yet – indeed, it is
prohibited – but an accurate map of prime resource sites
will be useful when the order is given to open up Mithril.


THE CHASM
A fissure in the bedrock has created a deep chasm.
Warmer conditions inside keep ice from forming
over the top, at least most of the time, and result in a
constant trickle of meltwater down the sides. In some
places this produces small waterfalls that have carved
the chasm sides into fantastic shapes. The chasm
is around 50 metres deep, with some deeper areas
filled with water. Plant life not seen elsewhere grows
in this sheltered environment, feeding a variety of
animals. The chasm offers good shelter from a storm,
although it would not be possible to get the ATV into
it (not in a manner that would facilitate getting it out
again, anyway). Travellers who explore the chasm will
eventually discover there are caves, some underwater,
running off to the sides. In one of these caves is a large
pile of bones. They are ancient and there are dozens or
perhaps hundreds of sets. Closer examination suggests
they might be Aslan but also a primitive culture and
dating the bones would place them here long before
Aslan ever reached this region of space.


THE EPHEMERAL GLADE
An ephemeral glade occurs when the temperature rises
above freezing for a day or two in areas where this is
rare. Warmer regions have vegetation all the time but in
colder areas life must make the most of the few chances
that occur. An ephemeral glade centres on a pool of
meltwater, around which plants spring up at an incredible
rate. It is possible to watch the plants grow, with some
bamboo-like species reaching a height of two or three
metres in just a few hours. Creeping plants climb the
taller varieties and a carpet of moss-like growth covers
the ground. Within an hour or two, small creatures can
be seen clambering over the plants and devouring them.
Thus begins an orgy of feeding, mating and egglaying
which goes on until the temperature drops enough
to start freezing the pond. Once that happens, the
vegetation rapidly dies. Creatures continue to feed on
dying plant matter for a while but it quickly dissolves into
brown sludge. Within hours of a temperature drop the
glade is gone and the creatures return to hibernation.

# ANIMAL ENCOUNTERS


Animal life is sparse on Mithril. Most of what exists is primitive and small, variations of thick-skinned reptiloids with the
ability to burrow into snow. There are few large predators on Mithril; most creatures are either herbivores or opportunistic
scavengers. The Referee should use the following creatures – with the possible exception of snow-worms – at any time
it seems appropriate. An animal encounter can make one of the events noted above a lot more complicated.


CALAMANDER
The calamander is a reptiloid scavenger, with
individuals falling into three distinct types; male, female
and protector. It lives in ice or snow terrain, burrowing
out extensive tunnels through which individuals can
move surprisingly quickly.


The large female is attended by several drone males
who feed her and take care of the warren; it is these
males that are the most likely initial encounter with
a calamander colony. Males are about the size of a
badger, are amphibious and tend to flee or hide when
threatened, except when the warren is attacked. If
unable to hide, males give off a curious squealing
sound which attracts other calamanders.


The third type of calamander is a protector, which
normally remains close to the warren. Protectors will
come to the aid of a squealing male and are vicious,
although they can be driven off if the warren is not
under threat. If it is, protectors will defend the female to
the death. The protector is significantly larger than the
male, although not as big as the female. Most tunnels
in a warren are not large enough to accommodate a
female; a mature female rarely leaves her burrow.


Calamanders are attracted to shiny objects and
will steal important components if they are left lying
around. Their tunnels are large enough for a human
to crawl into, although encountering a protector is
hazardous to say the least.

**CRYSTALLICE**
Crystallice are small but nasty creatures resembling ice
crystals. They are extremely hard to see, even for those
who know what to look for, and will attach themselves
to clothing or skin when something warm passes by.
Over the next few hours the Crystallice will crawl to
bare skin and begin to feed. They inflict a bite that
causes no real damage but is intensely painful and take
a small quantity of blood over the course of an hour or
two. After this, the crystallice – now a reddish colour –
drop off and digest their meal. Few can stand the pain
of the bite for this long but other than waiting for them
to drop off the only solution is to pick the Crystallice off

- which is in itself a painful exercise.

**RAUCUSS**
The raucuss probably has a proper scientific name but
the Sword Worlders assigned to the starport do not
know it and nicknamed the creature for the raucous
noise it makes. The raucuss is a flying scavenger,
which will devour anything organic and try to eat almost
anything else. Often encountered in small groups,
raucuss will mob other creatures to drive them away
from food and are prone to landing on buildings or
vehicles (including air-rafts in flight, which can be
comical) and pecking at seals or ripping antennae out
of fittings. Raucuss are noisily defiant and more likely to
hop out of reach and scream at Travellers than flee.

SNOW-WORM
The snow-worms of Mithril are rarely sighted and
thought by many to be myth. They move endlessly
under snow plains and can tunnel through solid ice
given enough time. Snow-worms are filter feeders,
extracting small particles of food from snow or ice
forced through their bodies, although a snow-worm will
eat larger organic matter, including the remains of an
ephemeral glade or some hapless creature trapped
in the snow. The worms are essentially mindless,
existing only to feed, but will rear up out of the snow
and lash at any source of damage with either end
of their long bodies. They may also attempt to eat
downed Travellers. Most snow-worms are about a
metre in diameter and around 25 metres long but giant
specimens have been (unreliably) reported.

# THE EXPEDITION

Once the Travellers get within 250 kilometres of the
beacon location, they will be able to contact the Bothildr
family. They are quite excited to be speaking to anyone,
which may make it a little difficult at first to get any
useful information. The family will ask what happened
at the port – all they heard was a garbled distress
signal – and if the Travellers have seen Egil and Katrin.
The Travellers will not know who that is at first.

It will not be hard to follow the beacon to the expedition
camp. It lies in a sheltered area, on the fringes of a
range of broken hills. Steep rockfaces are common
in the area, which has been fractured by ancient
upheavals to create multiple faults in the bedrock.
Scrubby Mithril taiga is common, providing additional
shelter but also making travel difficult.

The expedition camp consists of two semi-rigid field
shelter modules (see page 87), one configured as
living quarters and one as a working area. These
are surrounded by a windbreak constructed of
scrubby bushes cut and wired together. A framework
supporting an angled roof of the same vegetation
provides overhead cover.

There are a few items outside; mostly equipment
left carelessly on a folding table or dumped in a pile
where no-one is likely to trip over it. The working
area contains only a couple of portable computer
terminals and a network interface. There is no long-
range communications antenna since the expedition
were using the one onboard the air/raft before it left.
The living quarters are equally sparsely appointed,
with a few personal items

The Bothildr family have no reason to be suspicious –
indeed, they have many reasons to be glad to see a
vehicle approach – but they do have a healthy caution
due to working in the wilds. Eric stands in the open,
waving to the ATV, with his shotgun nearby in case
it is needed. Myntelle positons herself out of sight
where she can use her rifle if necessary. The kids, too,
disappear among the nearby vegetation.


If the Travellers seem non-threatening, the family
welcomes them with greetings and anxious questions.
Although they are gravely concerned, the family
are also bound by a long habit of frontier hospitality.
Anyone who stays still long enough will be offered a
bowl of stew and hot drink. Eric also slyly produces a
flask of something stronger and quite unpleasant. The
offering of food and drink is not merely a social ritual; it
is a chance to take the measure of the newcomers.


The Travellers will notice the stew is thin and tastes
odd. It is made from rations that will only last so long
and has been supplemented with local ingredients –
calamander meat and berry-like objects picked from
a bush. Although these have little food value, they
add bulk to an otherwise meagre meal. The Bothildrs
will think much more highly of the Travellers if they
reciprocate the offer of food from their more plentiful
supplies but only if they do so in a sensitive manner.
The family are proud, like most Sword Worlders, and
will not take kindly to being patronised or offered what
looks like charity – even if it actually is charity.


The Bothildr adults are quite happy to talk about
events like an attack on the starport in front of the
children; they are going to need to deal with what
has happened sooner or later, after all; this may
surprise Travellers who are careful what they say
around the kids. Eric wants to get his family back to
the starport and offworld as soon as possible and will
ask the Travellers to take them.


The Travellers, for their part, know the family came out
here in an air/raft but it is clearly not present. Eric can
fill in some of the details – including the part where
he and Egil had a short and not very fair fight over
the vehicle. The two port staff wanted to race back
immediately as soon as the distress call from the port
was heard. The last Eric saw of them was a hurried
takeoff that clipped a nearby rock stack. The air/raft
disappeared into the distance, flying unsteadily. It did
not answer any communications from the family and
soon after it took off its distress beacon was activated.
Since the air/raft was not present at the port, Eric
believes it might have come down in the snow plains.


25


TRAVELLER


Eric and his kin have been stuck here since, eating
reduced rations and trying to continue their work
as best they can in the hope that ‘something...
you maybe... would turn up’. He makes little of the
fact that his family would eventually starve or die
of exposure if help did not arrive – it either would
appear or it would not; there was no point in fretting
over what Eric could not control.


Eric proposes breaking camp and heading back to the
port as soon as possible but suggests setting off at first
light rather than halfway through a day. He also wants
to look for the downed air/raft; he did not like the port
staff members much but they may be stranded and he
feels he should try to help them.


In the interim, Eric asks his kids to show the
Travellers around the site and explain what they have
found. If anyone is interested, the Bothildr kids offer
a highly erudite explanation of what they have been
working on as they lead a quick tour of the area. This
is a little tricky in places as the local vegetation can
be thick and surprisingly resilient.


THE EXPEDITION’S FINDINGS
Some years ago, a starship came through the port with
a crippled jump drive. As luck would have it, a suitable
spare part was in storage and, in return for it, the crew
undertook a rather amateurish (in the opinion of Runa,
anyway) survey of some points of interest. They found
strange rock carvings in one location (‘and managed to
miss all the others!’) and a radioactive waste site dating
back hundreds or maybe thousands of years. The port
warden duly noted the findings and sent them off to be
forgotten about in his report.


Eric and Myntelle Bothildr came across the report
some years ago (‘while they were killing time at
the university so us kids could grow up a bit’) and
decided to come to Mithril to investigate. An aerial
survey indicated rock carvings at several spots, all of
them widely spaced, but virtually no evidence of an
advanced settlement. That suited the Bothildrs; they
were mostly interested in primitive cultures.


The initial hypothesis was that Mithril was once
warmer, had an indigenous intelligent species, which
never reached the technological stage, and that the
radioactive waste came from some other source. This
idea was blown out of the water (‘Dad says his idea
evolved, though!') by proof that Mithril has not had a
warmer phase in hundreds of thousands of years.


The rock carvings are primitive but impressive. They
seem to depict giant Aslan-like figures but also smaller
ones that also appear to be Aslan. There is at least
one better set of carvings somewhere on Mithril but the
survey neglected to indicate where and the Bothildr
family have not located it. What they have found,
however, is a crude cave-village settlement not far
into the hills. It was surrounded by refuse that had
been buried over many years, suggesting primitive
people lived there for some time. Conditions in the hills
are tough but not as bad as out on the snow plains.
Presuming plant and animal life could support these
people, a settlement could have been sustained.


What the Bothildr family are sure of is that these
people were Aslan – genetically, if not culturally.
They have measured the bones and teeth found at
the site, including some in a burial cave, and have
concluded without any doubt that primitive Aslan at
one time lived on Mithril. The question of how they got
here, considering Mithril is far from the Hierate and
the bones date from long before Aslan moved into
this region of space, is a good one. Eric believes the
reported radioactive waste dump suggests these Aslan
had high technology at their disposal. Perhaps they
arrived by starship – an extremely long-range colony
ship perhaps? If so, their colony presumably could not
sustain its technological base and eventually failed. Later
generations lived a primitive life until they died out.


Eric believes the fate of these Aslan was not a
miserable one. Their new world was harsh and
unforgiving but Aslan are tough and relish challenges.
They were lords of this world in their time and perhaps
they were content.


He also harbours a theory that some remnants of
ancient Aslan technology could be still on Mithril.
Despite his primary interest in primitive peoples, he
would be fascinated to find out more about these
ancient interstellar voyagers. Why come so far from
the Hierate? Why settle on Mithril? Did they build
colonies elsewhere? If they got this far, where else did
the ancient Aslan voyage to? Are there more of them
out there somewhere?


These questions will have to wait, however. There is
pressing business; notably to find the downed air/raft
and get back to the starport.

The Expedition


# SEARCHING

Eric roughly knows the direction taken by the air/raft. For
some reason – he does not know why – it was not headed
directly back towards the starport. Eric’s best guess is
that the navigation system was damaged in the collision,
which might also explain the lack of communication once
the vehicle was out of sight. Myntelle remembers seeing
a storm front on the horizon and suggests the port staffers
were trying to go around it. Either way, the air/raft will not
have come down on a direct line back to the port.

The air/raft’s location should be chosen by the Referee,
somewhere off the Travellers’ route to the expedition
site by about 200 kilometres. Its guidance and main
communications systems are indeed damaged but
the short-range emergency beacon works. Once the
Travellers get within 100 kilometres they will pick up the
signal and can begin a more detailed search.

During this time it should be noted that the ATV may
be getting a bit full. Once the two air/raft survivors are
located, the situation will get worse. One solution, in
clearer weather at least, is for some to ride outside the
vehicle on its outer gantry. This is a little precarious –
the kids will love it however – and can get very cold
if it is windy. However, with suitable clothing a perch
outside the vehicle at least reduces crowding inside.

There are two minor incidents, both related, during
the search.

A SUDDEN LURCH
Even in clear conditions, patches of deep snow,
sometimes with layers of ice buried within, are not
uncommon. Some patches go on for tens of kilometres
and, apart from being monotonous to the eye, they are
generally a good thing – snow and ice are often more
even than bare ground and allow a higher cruising speed.

Whilst crossing such a patch of snow, the ATV suddenly
lurches forward and down, coming to a violent halt with
the driving cab buried in the snow. Everyone outside will
be flung off, although they will land in snow for only 1D
damage. Those inside will be flung into hard surfaces or
each other, suffering 2D damage and possibly causing


tempers to flare, although anyone who makes an Average
(8+) Athletics (dexterity) check can reduce the damage by
1D. Those strapped into seats suffer no damage.


It is not possible to open the cab doors due to packed
snow around the vehicle’s front end. Rear or roof access
points are free, enabling the Travellers to get outside
and take stock of the situation. Investigation shows that
the ATV has broken through a thin layer of frozen snow
and plunged its front wheels into a cavity beneath. This
is strangely tunnel-like, extending away in both directions
before ending in other collapsed sections. The cavity is
almost two metres in diameter and lined with packed,
frozen snow. It will remind Travellers of a pipe or burrow.


Getting the ATV free is mostly a matter of hard work.
Digging the cab out and shoving something under
the wheels to improve grip will enable it to be driven
clear. It will take time, however, and the work may be
complicated by bad weather or other problems; this is
an excellent opportunity for an interaction with Mithril’s
wildlife. Calamanders will try to steal small tools, the
raucuss will try to eat them and crystallice may be
found on Travellers’ skin after the vehicle is freed.


SOMETHING MOVING IN THE SNOW!
While the Travellers are digging out their ATV, someone
spots movement in the snow or just under it. After a
few minutes, more movement is spotted some distance
away. Staring at a large expanse of snow is likely to
play tricks on the eyes and Travellers who are watching
for movement cannot work properly. The Referee
should play a couple more incidents of this sort out,
with people pointing and shouting, sometimes looking
in completely different directions.


After a few repetitions, Travellers who make an Average
(8+) Recon check will spot that the last movement is
snow falling into a cavity remarkably like the one the
ATV plunged into. No known natural phenomenon could
cause such regular cavities through the snow but there
is no creature around that could have done it, either.


Once the ATV is freed, the Travellers can press on.
Eventually the air/raft distress beacon is detected and
as the ATV closes in voice contact can be made with
the survivors. They are both alive but not in a good


27


TRAVELLER


situation. The air/raft is unflyable but Egil managed to
get it down in the mouth of an ice cave. While power
remains, the survivors have light and heat but their food
ran out days ago and what vegetable matter Katrin
managed to drag together does not seem to make
good ration bars even when processed through the
emergency field utility module (see page 87) carried as
part of the air/raft’s survival stores.


Egil is injured and cannot move around much, so the
survivors could not leave the cave and meet the Travellers
even if there were not ‘something’ lurking outside. They
do not know what it is, only that they have seen glimpses
of something moving under the snow; something serpent-
like. The survivors have not been attacked but fear they
will be if they encounter whatever is under the snow.


GETTING TO THE SURVIVORS
The cavities encountered by the Travellers were made
by a particularly large example of a snow-worm, one of
Mithril’s largest creatures. They are attracted to warmth
and will eat anything they can filter out of the snow.
However, the worm outside the ice cave is big enough
to swallow a person whole.


The worm will detect the approaching ATV and move
towards it under the snow, rearing up underneath with
enough force to tip the vehicle on its side. It will then lash at
the ATV with its body, potentially causing serious damage.


The worm is tough and persistent, and will have to be dealt
with somehow. It could be riddled with bullets but, rather
than fighting or killing the worm, the Travellers might treat it
as a problem to be solved. It can be driven off by powerful
vibrations through the ground and snow (small explosions
or an extremely loud sound system would do the trick) or by
something it does not like the taste of in the snow. Since the
worm cannot move without ingesting snow, anything toxic
or irritant will cause it to retreat rapidly. Fuel oil or solvent-
based chemicals, or almost any acritical liquid, will cause it
to retreat. Clever Travellers might be able to create a barrier
this way. Electricity will also work; zapping the worm with a
live cable from the ATV’s power plant will cause it to retreat,
although doing this without harming themselves might be a
challenge for the Travellers.


Once the worm is dealt with, the ATV can be righted
(digging away snow on one side and pushing the other
will work) and finally the survivors can be rescued.


EGIL AND KATRIN
Egil and Katrin are not in a good state. They are
extremely hungry and have been living in a crippled
air/raft for many days. The air/raft is of a ‘ragtop’
design, with a flexible cover over the six-person crew
compartment. This enabled the survivors to keep the
internal temperature above freezing but waste heat
has melted part of the ice cave, creating a puddle of
meltwater around the air/raft which has then frozen
again. Not only is this dangerously slippery, the vehicle
is frozen to the ground in several centimetres of ice.


If the Travellers want to remove the gravitic lifter
governor circuits, they will have to thaw out the ice
and gain access. This may require some ingenuity
and extracting the circuitry will be a cold job since
the Travellers have to stand on half-melted ice with
icewater running over their boots. There are no major
technical problems however.


Egil needs medical attention and has either fractured
or badly bruised ribs. It hurts him to breathe, let alone
move and, on top of hunger, cold and the knowledge
that the crash was his own stupid fault, this does not
make him a pleasant companion. He and Katrin are
suspicious of the Travellers, since they know something
bad has happened to their comrades at the port.
However, food and blankets will go a long way towards
overcoming their reservations.


Egil and Katrin do not know much more than the
Travellers, except that the visitor at the downport was
some kind of intelligence officer or maybe a courier.
He was supposed to have met the ship the Bothildr
family came in on and was annoyed at being delayed
by something in Imperial space. Other than that, the
intelligence officer was tight-lipped and surly, and did not
make good company. Katrin can add that she volunteered
for this assignment mainly to get away from him, as he did
not seem to understand the concept of ‘no’.


Finally, with the parts they need and an ATV full of
rescuees, the Travellers can head back to the starport.
The journey will take a few more days, during which
additional adventures could occur. The Referee
should use any events not yet encountered, perhaps
complicated by the overcrowded vehicle. The journey
back might become a nightmare of people riding
outside in a huff, others yelling at one another in the
passenger compartment while their comrades try to
sleep and so forth. It should be a memorable trip....

28

Searching


# RETURN

There is one last complication awaiting the Travellers
at the starport. Soon after reaching Imperial space with
their prize (the wounded intelligence officer), the crew
of the far trader _E-a-taka Wasab_ were curtly told to go
back and finish the job. There were to be no witnesses,
but more importantly they had failed to find critical data
the intelligence officer had stashed at the downport.
Without it, their employers were going to be displeased.
So, loading up some additional muscle _E-a-taka Wasab_
set off back towards Mithril downport, arriving a few
hours ahead of the Travellers.

The far trader crew spotted a starship on the landing
pad but it was silent and locked down. They landed a
force at the port and did a quick reconnaissance, after
which their starship took off again and began flying
an orbital search pattern. Believing they had plenty of
time, the attackers began a methodical search of the
port buildings, intending to crack open the starship
on the pad at their leisure. They did not know that the
Travellers’ ATV was approaching the port....

A SHIP IN ORBIT?
The ATV’s communications suite starts receiving a
feed from the port, which indicates a ship is in orbit.
Its behaviour is strange; it makes no attempt to
communicate but begins an approach to land. The
ships behaves as if its crew are not expecting an
answer from the port, which implies they know it is out
of action. The ship touches down, spends about an
hour on the landing pad, then takes off again. It begins
flying what looks like an orbital search pattern.

What the Travellers make of this, and how they
respond, will dictate the course of this part of the
adventure. Smart Travellers will be able to access
the communications logs, which show radio traffic
between the downport’s antenna and the ship in orbit.
This traffic is encrypted and cannot be read – the
port’s system is boosting the signal but not interpreting
it, so unless the Travellers can unscramble the
comms’ encryption (they may have the skills but not
the time, as it would take many hours to even attempt


breaking the encryption) they will not be able to tell
what is being said. However, knowing that something
is being said at all might still be useful.


It would be possible to hack the downport’s
security cameras from the ATV with a Difficult (10+)
Electronics (comms) check (1D hours, INT) and
doing so will enable the Travellers to determine what
is going on there. Essentially, a group of well-armed
personnel, probably low-end mercenaries, seem to
be tearing the place apart looking for something. The
Travellers’ ship seems intact for now.


How many mercenaries are at the port is up to the
Referee, and a count made using the cameras might
not be accurate. The opposition faced by the Travellers
should be significant but not overwhelming. The
mercenaries arrived aboard a far trader but it is possible
some of them were crammed into bunks in the cargo
hold rather than using standard staterooms aboard the
ship. If so, there could be quite a lot of them.


The far trader E-a-taka Wasab missed the Travellers’
ATV in its first sweep, largely because it overflew
during the initial climb to orbit when the crew had not
begun their search. It has now disappeared over the
horizon and will not be back for some time (the crew
are investigating something of interest spotted in a far
distant location; the radioactive waste dump reported by
the original survey perhaps?). Thus, the Travellers have
some time to act. Their ship is a sitting duck if E-a-taka
Wasab returns, however, so they act with some haste.


ENDGAME
The Travellers need to reach their ship and rig a repair on
the gravitic lifters. That will take D3+3 hours. It is unlikely
they will remain unobserved for that time but a stealthy
group might manage it – especially if the weather is bad.
An alternative approach would be to charge into the
downport and fight it out with the mercenaries. This is not
necessarily a great plan, since the Travellers’ resources
are limited and they have children aboard their vehicle.


29


TRAVELLER


Between these extremes is a smarter approach in which
the Travellers sneak into the installation and eliminate
some of the mercenaries quietly while others try to reach
their ship. The vessel does not need to be able to fly to
fight; its weapons turrets will function even if the lifters
are offline. Someone with a good Gunner skill could
ambush E-a-taka Wasab or at least hold it off with the
threat of weapons fire. That would require bringing up
the power plant to full capacity, a process that normally
takes about 30 minutes from standby. A good engineer
could do it faster, of course, with a Difficult (10+)
Engineer (power) check (5D minutes, INT)


The mercenaries will respond violently as soon as they
spot anyone in the downport. If the Travellers conduct
reconnaissance first, they may be able to stage ambushes
and rig the odds in their favour. If they just blunder in blindly
they will have to react to whatever happens.


The mercenaries, for their part, are complacent but
not stupid. They have a couple of personnel on guard
to patrol the installation and at least one sniper armed
with a laser rifle on the top of one of the buildings. The
effectiveness of any sniper will be limited in bad weather,
which might be used to the Travellers’ advantage.


The Referee can play fast and loose with timing if
necessary, perhaps allowing the repair to be completed
just in time for an escape if everything else has gone
badly wrong. A mad dash to the ship and a hurried takeoff,
pursued by E-a-taka Wasab and weapons fire from the
ground would make a suitably dramatic ending to the
adventure but the endgame can play out in many other
ways. A clever band of Travellers might simply slip away
without the mercenaries even realising they are there at all.


AFTERMATH
Once the Travellers have escaped from Mithril or eliminated
the threat from the mercenaries, there are a few choices
to be made. The Bothildr family want to continue their
research but Mithril seems very dangerous at present.
They will ask to be taken somewhere they can get a ship
home and re-outfit for another expedition and would prefer
to go somewhere in Sword World space. The survivors of
the port staff also need to get somewhere they can report
what has happened. None of them have money to pay for
passage, of course, but they should be able to arrange
payment if the Travellers can convey them to Biter or Sting.


It is possible that the Travellers might return to Mithril
with or without the Bothildr family and investigate the
mysterious primitive Aslan further. They may also stumble
upon what the mercenaries were searching for; a set of
data storage devices concealed among the pipes leading
from the reactor chamber to the underground fuel tanks.
Hidden inside a maintenance cover, these devices contain
multiple copies of the intelligence officer’s findings. They
are encrypted but can be broken sooner or later, and
make for interesting reading.


The intelligence officer compiled a detailed listing
of ships moving among the worlds of the Lunion
Shield, highlighting several that might be involved in
intelligence-gathering and others that could possibly
become assets for the Sword Worlds Confederation
(are the Travellers on this list, perhaps?). His findings
indicate some discrepancies in the movement of certain
Imperial merchant vessels, which may not be making
the stops their logs claim.


What the Travellers do with this data is up to them.
The Sword Worlds Confederation and Imperium would
both be willing to pay a finders’ fee of up to Cr25000
for the data, with no questions asked. It might even
be possible to sell it to both sides. Each will issue dire
warnings against doing so but you should fully expect
your Travellers to try it anyway. Indeed, they might be
approached to sell a ‘doctored’ version of the data to
the other side and might end up being able to sell two
versions of the same information, twice, to both parties.


As to the attack on the downport and abduction of
a Sword Worlder intelligence officer... he will likely
never be found (perhaps that was the point; what
if this was all an elaborate ploy to plant false data
and extract an operative?). Paranoia on both sides
creates ripples in their intelligence communities
but there is no indication this was an incident of
aggression. Nobody can prove anything.


The result, in the short term, is a slight escalation of
tensions and some sabre-rattling speeches by hawkish
political and military figures on both sides of the border.
There are those who fear the region is heading for
war and attention-grabbing headlines appear on the
datanets. For now, the only real consequence of the
Travellers’ Mission to Mithril is seeing their ship named
in an article called ‘12 Reasons Mithril Will Be The
Flashpoint of the Next War (View Now)’. There will,
however, be days when the Travellers wonder if the
screaming headlines were correct. Tensions remain
high along the border and there are many on both sides
who seem to want a new war.

# CHARACTERS AND OPPOSITION

THE EXPLORERS
Eric and Myntelle Bothildr have worked together for many years, returning to the field when their children were old
enough to be safe in a frontier camp. The kids are well-educated, especially on matters of history, geology and
wilderness survival, but not used to being around large numbers of people.

Eric is primarily an archaeologist, with an interest in
primitive cultures. This is what brought the family
to Mithril; old rumours of evidence on-planet of
habitation in the distant past. Eric is not an
‘Ancients hunter’; he believes the quest for
answers about the mysterious Ancients
is less interesting than finding out
how primitive people lived and what
they believed. He is a practical and
pragmatic man; whilst protective of his
wife and children, he trusts them to
take care of themselves.

and Myntelle will figure out why from the local conditions.
They are in many ways an ideal Sword Worlder couple,
with skills that complement one another and create a
partnership stronger than individuals. Myntelle is well
aware of this and might offend a female Traveller who
she sees as ‘trying to be just another man when you
could be a remarkable woman’.

Egino Bothildr, at 11 years old, is the youngest of
the children and on his first field expedition. He was
enjoying the experience until one of the port staff
dashed off with the air/raft. Egino saw his father try to
prevent this and get a bloody nose, so is likely to be
nervous around people he does not know. His mother
has dealt with this in pragmatic fashion by giving
Egino the spare gun; a small-calibre revolver normally
stashed in the expedition supplies. Egino has orders
not to show it to anyone but may pull it out if scared
enough. He is trying to be a tough Sword Worlder
man but he is ultimately a frightened kid.

Runa Bothildr is 14 and also on her first field
expedition, although she did some practice runs with
her father whilst Egino was too young to be taken
on an expedition. Runa hated the university where
her parents were working and enjoys the wide-open
spaces of Mithril. Like the others, she is concerned
about recent events but confident her parents will
figure something out. In the meantime, she has been
exploring the site more thoroughly than the others and
was the one who discovered the village.

TRAVELLER


Egil Tedorsson is a field operative, which basically
means he is assigned to Mithril Downport to do heavy
work and provide security, normally bulldozing snow
off the landing field or driving parties across the plains
on one of the intermittent sample-collecting missions.
He is not technically minded and at something of a loss
when there is no obvious path forward. He is currently
frustrated to the point of barely-repressed fury, not least
because it was him who damaged the air/raft and he has
no idea how to fix it. He is naturally transferring this to
Katrin, further damaging their already poor relationship.

THE PORT STAFF
Katrin Gyrowetz and Egil Tedorsson have both served on Mithril for a couple of years. They are a sort-of couple,
although do not really like each other all that much and are together more due to a lack of anyone more suitable.
This caused some friction with Myntelle Bothildr, who can be a little smug about her perfectly balanced family and
who made the mistake of giving relationship advice to Katrin.


Katrin is a technician, whose primary task at the port
was to look after the communications equipment
and deal with minor maintenance issues. She was
thoroughly bored during the field expedition, and
became argumentative at every opportunity, but on the
whole is dealing with the situation better than Egil.


In addition, Egil is injured and in quite a lot of pain. He
may have broken ribs from the second air/raft crash
and cannot move around quickly.

THE ATTACKERS
The crew who originally attacked the downport were sent back to finish the job. They are a typical low-end starmerc
group, of the sort who do not bother with niceties like licenses or bonding authorities. They are ruthless but not
especially skilled and are not expecting any resistance. Given how easily they overran the place last time (those
who were wounded are more a source of derision than a warning to others), the mercenaries are overconfident and
trying to cover several bases at once. They tend to shoot first and not bother with questions at all, and since they
have been told to eliminate everyone they encounter, they are not inclined to be merciful. Indeed, some enjoy the
idea of killing everyone on an entire planet.

# EQUIPMENT AND WEAPONRY

SWORD WORLDS


ALL-TERRAIN VEHICLE
The ATV found at Mithril Starport is a Sword
Worlds-built vehicle, slightly different to the version
encountered in the Imperium. Notably, it is vastly more
expensive but has effectively unlimited range. It is
also less well protected due to the need to shoehorn a
fusion plant into a relatively small space.


The hull is significantly larger than the standard
Imperial ATV and the vehicle runs on six very large
wheels rather than eight, with tyres filled with a
lightweight gel which seals punctures and provides the
vehicle with buoyancy in water. The vehicle’s interior
consists of a driving compartment, main compartment
subdivided into two configurable areas separated by
the tiny galley on one side and fresher on the other,
and rear section which is accessed by way of an
airlock. There are side doors just behind the driving
compartment, and roof hatches in the driving and main
sections of the vehicle, but the only way to use these
as an airlock is to close the airtight partition between
the main and driving compartments. This is little more
than a plastic curtain but sufficient to allow atmosphere
to be retained in either compartment whilst the other is
evacuated or exposed to outside conditions.


Airlocks are not necessary on Mithril, as the
atmosphere is breathable, but the ATV is designed to
function on airless worlds. It has a small but efficient
life-support plant under the main compartment floor,
alongside its fusion power plant. So long as the vehicle
has power, it can recycle air and water, processing a
range of biological matter, gases and liquids. Plant and
animal matter can also be processed into an edible
paste served like porridge or formed into dried blocks
and carried as emergency rations. How nutritious
and bad-tasting these rations are depends on what is
available but in theory an ATV of this type can keep its
crew alive for months or even years.


The control cab has seats for a driver and an additional
crewmember, who can move the secondary seat
around to face a configurable instrument console.
The ATV is equipped with powerful driving lights and
remotely controlled spotlights plus radar, thermal and
low-light instruments. It is also equipped with magnetic
sensors and a seismic activity detector as standard.


The two configurable spaces are currently set up with two
bunks which can be collapsed when not in use, creating
additional working or living space. One configurable area
has a dining/meeting table on the other side, whilst the
forward compartment has workstations for two crew. This
is a common configuration for ATVs used for exploration.


The ATV has a narrow gantry running around the
outside from the cab doors to rear airlock, with
retractable ladders to reach the ground. This platform
is intended for use as an elevated working station, with
another pair of ladders giving access to the flat roof of
the vehicle. Like many similar vehicles, the ATV has
a small retractable dozer blade on the front, which on
Mithril is mainly used to clear snow, and a winch for
towing or self-recovery if the vehicle becomes ditched.


There is a small turret on the roof containing various
antennae and instruments including a powerful multimode
camera, and can support a light weapon. A locker next
to the rear airlock contains a shotgun and rifle, with 100
rounds of ammunition for each. They do not appear to
have ever been removed from their brackets.


The ATV is outfitted with a range of common tools,
including shovels, saws and various power tools which
can be charged or run directly off the ATV’s power
plant, along with an awning that can be used to protect
a work crew from the sun (unnecessary on Mithril!) or
increase living space by acting as a tent.


Typical working crew is four; two in the cab and two riding
in the rear area or sleeping as best they can in the bunks.
Collapsing the bunks makes it possible to accommodate
a more people in the rear area in cramped semi-comfort
and up to six or possibly more if they are jammed in like
sardines. Many crews resort to space-gaining tricks like
opening the airlock or moving items into it for storage, or
rigging seats or hammocks over the cargo, making a trip
more tolerable for a larger crew.

Equipment and Weaponry


**FIELD SHELTER MODULE**
Favoured by explorers and field teams, the FSM
system is designed to create a warm and weatherproof
shelter without being difficult to transport. Each module
is the same size; a 4x8x3 metrer block built out of an
inflatable frame/wall filling sandwiched between two
layers of extremely tough fabric. The roof is the same,
with the floor using a thicker inflatable layer over which
a thin flooring layer is laid. Translucent panels allow
some natural light into the shelter, which is supported at
the corners and edges by semi-rigid pipes that become
solid when pumped full of high-pressure air.

The shelter gives good insulation and is reasonably
resilient but cannot survive strong winds or snow piling
on the roof; a windbreak or overhead cover is essential
in these conditions. Each module has its own pump
unit, which can run on its own batteries or an external
power source. The pump can also be configured to
act as a heating, ventilation and compressor/filter unit,
taking in external air and making it safe to breathe
before pumping it inside. A detachable secondary outer
door creates an airlock if one is needed.

An FSM can theoretically be used on a vacuum or
trace atmosphere world but is not designed for these
conditions and may fail unexpectedly. It is safe in very
thin or tainted atmospheres and remains tolerable even
in extremely cold conditions.


FIELD UTILITY MODULE
The FUM is a ubiquitous and almost universally hated
piece of survival equipment, with a range of applications.
At its core is a small but powerful mashing and grinding
unit that can pulp almost any organic matter, which can
be processed into drinking water and a compressed
‘food bar’ or porridge-like substance. The nutritional
value of the product depends on the raw materials;
on Mithril there is little that can provide sustenance to
humans, so the output of an FUM will be both disgusting
and of poor quality. There are those, calling themselves
FUM-chefs, who claim to be able to feed the right
ingredients into an FUM and produce something edible
but this usually means just adding a vast quantity of hot
sauce to the mix and hoping for the best.


The FUM runs off an external power source such as an
ATV or air/raft and has internal batteries which will keep it
in operation for at least two weeks. The FUM can supply
heat to a tent or shelter, and has a hotplate for more
conventional cooking, and has detachable flashlights.


Most ATVs have a larger version of the FUM as part
of the galley but it is rarely used except on very long
expeditions. A standard FUM is carried as part of the
emergency kit in some ATVs and most air/rafts intended
for use outside major cities. In theory, an FUM can keep
survivors warm and fed, supplying them with drinking
water, until they are rescued. More commonly, it is used
as a mobile power source by teams in the field.

# FINAL NOTE: ASLAN ON MITHRIL


Classic Traveller Double Adventure 2: Mission on
Mithril/Across the Bright Face presented a tantalising
hint that Aslan had at some time in the distant past
been present on Mithril. This was an anomaly, which
was never really explained in later materials.


The conclusions drawn by the Bothildr family are
essentially correct; the primitive people of Mithril are
indeed Aslan and they originated offworld. The Aslan
discovered the jump drive in -1999 but it is not clear
exactly when they came to Mithril. If they arrived before
the invention of the jump drive, they must have used a
‘sleeper’ ship of some kind. If so, it is quite possible that
Mithril was not their intended destination but that some
or all of the colonists were placed there for some reason.


There is an implicit implication that, at some point,
there was a technological society on Mithril. This is
correct; a segment of the colony mission’s population
was deposited on Mithril with sufficient materials and
equipment to build a small city. This may have been
intended as a waypost, or they might have been
exiled for some reason.


The colony on Mithril failed and by the time the Sword
Worlds were colonised around -400 there were no
Aslan living there. They lingered for some centuries
after the collapse of their technological society, eking
out an existence as hunter/gatherers and creating
increasingly crude monuments to their former
greatness. The earliest Aslan carvings on Mithril were
made with energy weapons or instruments developed
from them; the last were chipped out with stone tools.
Yet all seem to depict the same thing – giant, ‘godlike’
Aslan and smaller ‘mortal’ Aslan. The message was
clearly important but is lost to history unless someone
like the Bothildr family can decipher the carvings.


In the meantime, the presence of Aslan on Mithril raises
new questions:
•	 Why did they come so far?
•	 Why did they leave the Hierate at all?
•	 Are there remains of their technological enclave
somewhere on Mithril?
•	 Did some other part of the expedition keep going
past Mithril and where might they have ended up?


It is possible that these early Aslan voyagers
encountered the Darrian civilisation, which had reached
TL3 by -1500 and (with the assistance of Terran
settlers) could build jump-capable ships by -1395. The
Darrians lost a lot of their records in the Maghiz, a
self-inflicted nova event that destroyed their interstellar
civilisation in -925, so it is entirely possible they did
encounter the early Aslan colony mission but have
since lost that knowledge.


Inquisitive Travellers might want to find out more
about the lost Aslan of Mithril and there are those
who would pay well for good information. Several
universities would be interested and some Imperial
agencies might try to use the previous settlement of
Mithril to undermine Sword World control. The Aslan
Hierate might also be very interested in knowing what
happened to their lost brethren and could make use of
the discovery that they once had a foothold in what is
now human space.


These implications are beyond the scope of this
adventure. Subsequent events are, as always, at the
discretion of the Referee and their Travellers.
