# INTRODUCTION

Career Book 1 is the first of a short series of career books
from Spica Publishing offering new career options for

Traveller character generation. A few of the careers available
in the Traveller Main Rulebook have been deliberately left out
but alternative character generation options are included in

this book for the remaining careers.

##### CHARACTERS AND CAREERS

Characters are central to any role-playing game; they are the
alter-egos of the players in the game universe. Within each

game universe, there are many thousands of ways a
character can live, work or otherwise occupy their time. This
book presents players and Referees with new character

generation options that allow players greater choice in the
characters they choose to play, and Referees a wider range
of sources for generating non-player characters.

Within a science fiction RPG setting, the number and types of
careers available to characters (both human and alien) can be
massive, and each race or species has its own unique take

and influence on careers, often offering skills or benefits not
available to other races in similar or identical careers.

The eight new careers available in this book are suitable for

all human characters and the majority of alien characters.
Wherever possible, players should discuss their character‟s

career options with their Referee before generating a
character, especially if the player intends to generate an alien
character. However, in some cases, some modification of the
career tables may be necessary by the Referee or player to

enable alien character generation. This approach is nothing
new in the world of RPGs and is actively encouraged by Spica

Publishing.

This book is presented in two distinct sections: the first
provides some alternative tables for a selection of the careers

available in the Traveller Main Rulebook, whilst the second
presents completely new careers for players and Referees to
use for character generation.

##### EXPANDED TABLES

**Mishap and Events Tables:** The expanded tables

chapter of this book (beginning on page 3) provides

players and Referees with alternatives to the original

Mishap and Events tables for the _Agent (10 TMB),_

_Drifter (16 TMB), Entertainer (18 TMB), Merchant (_

_TMB), Nobility (26 TMB), Rogue (28 TMB)_ and _Scholar_

_(30 TMB)_ careers.

New tables for _Army (12 TMB), Marine (20 TMB), Navy_

_(24 TMB)_ and _Scout (32 TMB)_ are not included in this

book, as these will be covered in future _Traveller_ books

from Mongoose Publishing.

**Expanded Life and Unusual Events Tables:** The expanded
Life Events and Unusual Events tables in this book are

intended to be complimentary to or alternatives for the original
table on _34 TMB_.

##### NEW CAREERS

This book contains eight new careers: Adventurer, Bounty
Hunter, Clergy, Colonist, Corporate Citizen, Militant Religious,
Space Patrol and Worker. Each career includes:

 A brief description of the career and its assignments;

including ranks (where applicable) and mustering out
benefits tables;
 Mishap and Events tables.

Aliens and New Careers
These new character career types are just a few of many,
many thousands of different occupations available throughout
inhabited space.

All of these careers are suitable for human player or non-
player characters; some are more suitable than others for
various alien species. Players who wish to generate a
character that is one of the alien races from an already
publish game universe should discuss their idea of how the
alien character should be generated with the Referee
responsible for the current game.

It is always worth looking back at previously published
material about alien species to see if the intended career from
this book has been available for the alien species before.

# PRE-GENERATED CHARACTERS

On pages 31 and 32 of this book are pre-generated
characters: one from each assignment of each of the new

careers and several multi-career characters. These
characters can be used as player characters or as non-player
characters.

##### THE CHARACTER PROFILE

Each character‟s information is presented in a standard

format called the Character Profile. This format is based on
the format shown for the character generation example
character on _40 TMB_ , but is expanded here.

**Number, Career, Assignment and Final Rank**
Each character profile shows the number of the character in

this list, followed by the character‟s career, assignment within
the career and final rank on leaving the character generation
process.

**Basic Information**

The next line of the profile shows the character‟s age in
standard years, the number of terms served in total and the

character‟s Credit balance on mustering out. Note that
character 19 has a negative Credit balance.

**Retirement Pay:** The character‟s retirement pay (in Credits

per year) is also shown on this line if the character has served
five or more terms in a career that qualifies for retirement pay.
Note that the _Adventurer_ and _Bounty Hunter_ careers do not

qualify for retirement pay due to the high earnings such
characters can achieve.

**Characteristic Block**

The characteristic block shows the values of each
characteristic and associated Characteristic DM, as described
on _5 & 6 TMB_.

**Psionic Strength (Psi):** Psi is shown at the end of the normal
characteristic block on a separate line. This value and

characteristic DM has been generated by and is used as per
the rules in the Psionics chapter _(152 TMB)_.

**Skills**

Skills for each character are listed in alphabetical order.

Wherever a skill has a specialization, this is shown as (any)
after the skill name (e.g. Engineering (any)). This allows

Referees and players to adjust the pre-generated character‟s
skills to suit the game more readily with the minimum of effort.

Where a character has a skill of Level 2 or more (such as Gun

Combat (any) 2) the Referee or player can split the skill levels
into separate skills, such as Gun Combat (Slug Rifle) 1 and
Gun Combat (Slug Pistol) 1.

The Social Science (Theology) skill specialization is new and
is described below. It has been pre-selected for the Clergy

and Militant Religious careers.

**Psionic Talents**
Psionic talents are listed in alphabetical order on a separate

line, underneath the list of normal skills.

Equipment
Equipment for each character is listed in alphabetical order.

The equipment the character gained when generated is listed
in the Equipment section. Equipment can include vehicles,
Travellers‟ Aid Society membership (shown as “TAS”), travel
passages (Low, Mid or High Passage), body armor, and
starships.

If a character has more than one weapon or ship share as
part of their equipment, the number of each is shown (for
example: 3 Ship Shares, 2 Weapons).

Allies, Contacts, Enemies and Rivals
Allies, Contacts, Enemies and Rivals are shown in the
Equipment section of the character profile. Some have a
clarification in parenthesis after them, such as Contact
(Criminal) or Ally (Alien). This serves to indicate what type of
ally, contact, enemy, or rival the character has.

If a character has more than one Ally, Contact, Enemy or
Rival listed in their Equipment, the number of each is shown
(for example: 3 Allies, 2 Rivals). Different types of each are
differentiated by type. For example, a character with two Allies
might have Ally and Ally (Alien).

##### NEW SKILL SPECIALISATION

The Social Science (Theology) skill specialization is new. The
Clergy and Militant Religious careers have this skill
specialization pre-selected.

Social Science (Theology)
The character has extensive knowledge of their chosen
religion and has the ability to practically apply the tenets,
values and beliefs of that religion to everyday life.

This includes being able to justify their actions by quoting
references from religious texts, and using parables, stories
and examples to provide illustrations of their chosen religion
being superior to any other.

Higher levels of Social Science (Theology) specialization
indicate a deeper and more complex understanding of the
religion.
