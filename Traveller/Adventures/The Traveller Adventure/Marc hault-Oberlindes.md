Marc hault-Oberlindes, Baron Feri, is owner of [[Oberlindes|Oberlindes Lines]]; he inherited a small merchant corporation and has devoted most of his life to its expansion; he has dreams of making it an [[Imperium]]-wide megacorporation. Oberlindes Lines is based in the [[Regina subsector]]: present projects include increased trade with the [[Vargr Extents]] and further penetration of markets in the [[Aramis subsector]]. Oberlindes runs a paternalistic organization; he is extremely loyal to his employees and expects unquestioned loyalty in return. Oberlindes delights in frustrating authority; for example, he once purchased a [[The Emissary|60,000-ton lmperial cruiser]] , ostensibly for scrap, and then proceeded to put the ship (christened Emissary) into operation in the [[Vargr Extents]]; by fancy paperwork and by playing various groups of bureaucrats against each other, he was able to obtain the ship with its high-powered armaments intact, an action which is against [[Imperium|Imperial]] policy but not strictly illegal provided the ship never enters the [[Imperium]]. Oberlindes also bears a grudge against the [[Kforuzeng]]. Several months ago, elements of the Emr'ssary's crew attempted to take control of the ship and sell it to the [[Kforuzeng]], presumably at their instigation. The mutiny was quelled with the aid of [[Arrlanroughl]], but Oberlindes' son, Sergei, was injured.
