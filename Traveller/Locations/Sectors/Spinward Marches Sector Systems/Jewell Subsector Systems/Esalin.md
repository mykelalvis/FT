# DETAILS

Of the eight planets in this solar system, four are gas giants. Esalin is the seventh planet from the sun and is the only colonized world in the system.

Esalin 0204 C565673–8 Z Ag Ga G Esalin was first settled by Imperial colonists in 835 and was occupied by the [[Zhodani]] at the beginning of the Fourth Frontier War in 1082. Its location between the Imperial and [[Zhodani]] borders has made it a key factor in many diplomatic negotiations.

Esalin has always been known for its fertile lands and rich harvests. The planetary conditions and varied climates have also allowed for a wide variety of crops to be grown, from tropical fruits to exotic vegetables.

Even during the [[Zhodani]] occupation, the Imperial farmers were allowed to continue their work unhindered. The rich harvests of this world have been a benefit to both [[Zhodani]] and Imperials alike. In 1098, a treaty was signed declaring Esalin as neutral territory but the [[Zhodani]] government remained to administer its inhabitants.
