# ARAMIS

Aramis is part of a secondary main lying just off the coreward-trailing tip of the [[Spinward Main]]. A spur leads rimward into the [[Rhylanor subsector]] but the primary arm runs to trailing across the rimward end of [[Pretoria]]. This gives jump-2 access to [[Pretoria]] itself and the very edge of the Lamas [[subsector]] beyond, although astrography intervenes at that point.

As a result, [[Aramis]] and the region around it is something of a nexus for trade into Deneb as well as the [[Vargr Extents]] to coreward. Considerable quantities of goods come into Aramis Highport from Pretoria via jump-1 vessels plying the main and then transhipped aboard jump-2 vessels via [[Nutema]] and [[Celepina]], either to the [[Spinward Main]] or Rhylanor cluster.

There is a very healthy brokerage and private shipping industry operating out of Aramis Highport, in addition to vessels of the mid-level shipping line Akurat, a subsidiary of Tukera Lines dedicated to serving this region. Actual Tukera vessels do come this far coreward, if infrequently. Akurat ships call at the smaller ports of the coreward end of the subsector although their main business is done in the more settled areas towards the rimward ends of Aramis and Pretoria.

Few vessels proceed to the surface of Aramis. The world itself is forbidding, with a exotic atmosphere and no surface water. Despite this unpromising aspect, several hundred thousand people live in Aramis, underground in comfortable, high-tech and carefully sealed cities.

Aramis is the fief of an important member of the Tukera family, although it is not directly ruled - officially. The Marquis of Aramis is the richest and most powerful member of the ruling class on Aramis, all of whom are heads of critical industries or important businesses.
Thus, although the rank of Marquis is an Imperial title and does not confer rulership of the world, the Tukera family and the Marquis in particular dominate all government affairs.

Aramis also hosts both a naval and scout base. The naval base is co-located with the Highport and acts as the headquarters for the subsector fleet and system squadron, which is not large and augmented by a handful of system defence boats crewed by mercenaries. These are in service with the Aramis Port Authority but paid for by donations coming from the office of the Marquis. Heavy units of the Sector Fleet are based elsewhere in the subsector but there is usually a cruiser or carrier task group in the Aramis system on guardship deployment.

Guardships are usually deployed for several weeks at a time and normally relieved on station by a replacement vessel or task force. It is not possible to maintain many such standing deployments, especially of larger vessels like heavy cruisers, without diluting naval strength in the region excessively. Most naval deployments are part of a patrol schedule whereby vessels proceed through a series of locations in the course of a cruise, staying a few days at each before moving to the next.

The fact that Aramis enjoys the more-or-less permanent assignment of a heavy cruiser or similar-sized vessel, along with escorts and support vessels, suggests the navy considers it to be of great importance. However, there are plenty of other ports which see more trade and a lot of worlds whose industrial base is greater, so what is so special about Aramis?

The answer, at least as far as most cynics are concerned, is that Aramis is the fief of a senior member of a megacorporate family and given naval protection as a result of his firm's importance to the Imperium.

Whether or not this is true, the location of Aramis at the coreward end of the subsector protects it from most raids launched by corsairs out of the Vargr Extents.
Akurat vessels are well defended and more than a match for a typical merchant-ship-turned-corsair. However, their very toughness makes them a target for a certain kind of raider captain, who seeks to make a reputation back home as much as profit from his voyages. Although requiring heavy firepower, good planning and luck, such strikes have been successful. As a rule, however, pirates tend to go after easier targets.

The Aramis scout base is not large, being mainly concerned with supporting the x-boat route from Rhylanor to Pretoria. Survey and exploration vessels operate out of this base, mainly to monitor and collect data on the rimward parts of the subsector; affairs to coreward are the province of the much larger way station at Junidy and the smaller base at Nasemin.
