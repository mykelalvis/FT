[[BtC-5505.jpg|Llellewyoly]]

[[Junidy]] is a small world with a very thin atmosphere, home to a population numbering around 30 billion of whom about half belong to the minor race nicknamed 'Dandelions' or 'Dandies'. Their correct name is Llellewyoly, as near as humans can pronounce it. The Dandies are adapted to the extremes of temperature experienced by Junidy in the course of its day and display traits of both plant and animal.

Llellewyoly have five multi-jointed limbs, which house their sense organs and serve interchangeably as hands and feet. The central, spherical, body is covered with long, coarse hair. These rather odd beings have a TL3 culture which is extremely complex. Individuals hold a number of social ranks, each with its own form of address, depending on the current situation. Using the wrong form of address for an individual's current social status (which can literally change from one minute to the next) is a major social gaffe and can result in ostracism.

> The Llellewyloly are native to Junidy, although can sometimes be encountered on similar worlds with low surface gravity and very thin atmosphere. They are unusual among sentient species in that they have five limbs, all of which can function as legs, arms or something in between, whilst a central 'head' contains the major organs. Respiration is carried out across the entire surface of the central structure, enabling survival in a very thin atmosphere.
>
> Llellewyloly society is very complex and outsiders typically find the shift in focus from one individual to another bewildering. Even the humans of Junidy, who have shared their homeworld with the Llellewyloly for centuries, struggle to keep track of who is pre-eminent at any given moment.
>
> Physically, Llellewyloly are much more lightly built than humans, massing around 35kg. Their limbs are highly dextrous but fragile, with relatively poor lifting power, and they have difficulty in manipulating devices built for human hands.

> Llellewyloly Travellers roll 2D3 to determine their STR and END.

> ### Traits

> Llellewyloly Travellers all possess the following traits:
> Alien Digits: Unless a device is specifically adapted for Llellewyloly, they suffer DM-2 for any checks related to its use.
> Atmosphere (thin): Llellewyloly can function without protection in a very thin atmosphere but require protection from a dense or very oxygen-rich atmosphere.
