The Sher system was virtually uninhabited until the early years of the Third Imperium when it became host to the Core's largest prison system. There are several facilities, each designed to house criminals of various stripes, from organised crime bosses to mass murderers. The prisons are reserved only for those who have broken Imperial law or severe violations of subsector and planetary laws with a sentence of life without parole. All of the prison facilities on the planet are located in the murky nitrogen soup of its lower atmosphere. Some are subterranean and others are bunkers half submerged in rocky plains and valleys. Stepping outside without the aid of an environment suit brings about a quick death as cold nitrogen replaces oxygen in the lungs, causing asphyxiation. As if the environment alone were not sufficient to prevent escape attempts, the prisons use high-technology surveillance and access systems to monitor and limit each prisoner's every move.

The civilian population of the planet are housed in cities on the planet's mountains and plateaus, where the atmosphere is a breathable oxygen-nitrogen mix. Workers take the high-speed maglev train to work in the dismal prison facilities below. There is no naval base in the Sher system but the navy does have an administrative office on the planet, which reports to the base on Temra. Temra provides offworld management of the prison planet and supplies its civilian personnel.
