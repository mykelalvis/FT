Glisten lies entirely within the [[Imperium]], for many years a backwater lying on an unimportant frontier, receiving little attention. X-boats bound for Imperial holdings in Pax Rulin (rimward, towards the [[Great Rift]]) ran through [[Glisten]] itself but otherwise there was little need to develop the region. The opening of [[District 268]] for Imperial expansion in [[IY0940]] brought greater importance to Glisten and has stimulated investment.

Many of the worlds in the subsector lie on the [[Spinward Main]], although the [[Glisten Arm]] is a lightly travelled part of the main. It terminates at [[Bendor]], however a jump-2 capable ship can reach any world in the subsector and proceed beyond into [[Trin's Veil Subsector|Trin's Veil]] and finally back to [[Mora Subsector|Mora]].

The subsector is the responsibility of the 100th Fleet, with its headquarters at [[Glisten]] itself. The fleet is understrength and contains mostly small or obsolescent vessels, its strength further diluted by the need to patrol [[District 268]] and maintain a detachment there. The Sector Fleet also has a light presence in the subsector; the region is a long way from likely combat zones in a war with the [[Zhodani]].

There are seven [[Amber Zone]]s in Glisten and one world that, while not actually a [[Red Zone]], has access strictly restricted. This is [[Mithras]], an Imperial prison world.  Environmental conditions are harsh, making survival outside the prison complex problematical at best. Although some prisoners are life-long exiles, there are separate areas for those serving long but finite sentences. The complex has a good rehabilitation record and a small, attached institution for the criminally insane.

[[Egypt]] is a major training base for [[Colonial Office]] personnel. Originally set up for a large-scale move into [[District 268]], the facility has supported several operations elsewhere and offers a retraining service for ex-Imperial service personnel seeking to make a new life on a frontier world.

[[Glisten]] itself is named for the capital settlement in a system characterised by cities built in the two asteroid belts. Originally called Gliss Ten (Gliss being the name of the system's star), Glisten City rose to become the system capital and eventually the administrative center for the subsector. There are many other large cities throughout the system's belts, most specialising in one aspect of industry or economic endeavor.

[[Marastan]] is an Imperial reserve world. Although access to the starport and associated city are unrestricted, only properly accredited academics are permitted access to the world at large, as Marastan is preserved as a showcase for plant and animal species collected by the [[Scout Service]]. Some of these are now extinct in their home environment but survive on Marastan in carefully segregated reserves.

Other worlds of interest in the subsector include [[Romar]], source of dust-spice, a narcotic valued by the [[Aslan]], and [[Melior]], whose population is about half [[Jonkeereen]].  [[Callia]] also has a significant Jonkeereen minority, numbering around a quarter of the total population.
