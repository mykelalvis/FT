**Akussanja** is an agricultural, nonindustrial world still lacking adequate means to expand its economy.

- As an agricultural world, this world is a near-ideal environment  for producing quality foodstuffs of plant, animal, and other forms. Quality foodstuffs are a major export commodity for this world.
- It requires extensive imports of outside technology to maintain a modern, star-faring society. Having to import most manufactured and high tech goods drives the price up for these items at this world.
- It is a member of the [[Third Imperium]] in the [[Perite Subsector]] of [[[[Core sector]] ]] in the [[Domain of Sylea]](/Domain_of_Sylea "Domain of Sylea").
- This world contains an [[Third Imperium|Imperial]] [[Scout Base]], capable of handling [[Scout Service|IISS]] [[starship]]s and personnel.

## Description (Planetology)

Akussanja is tidally locked to its primary, Blaukasa.

Approximately every 2.5 standard years, the secondary star Iona comes close enough to Akussanja to have a significant effect on the planet.

## History & Background (Dossier)

The [[Scout Service]] base in the system is there to observe the unusual Akussanjan life forms. IISS scientists believe that studies of the biochemistry of these creatures might have applications in the cryogenics field.

## NATIVE LIFE

[[#Akussanja]] hosts a variety of unusual life forms whose behaviors are affected by its red dwarf binary pair, Blaukasa and Iona. [[#Akussanja]] orbits Blaukasa, the larger of the two stars. Companion star Iona has an eccentric orbit, approximately 45° off the plane of the ecliptic. Every 2.5 standard years, Iona comes close enough to [[#Akussanja]] to have a significant effect on the system mainworld. When Iona is distant, [[#Akussanja]]'s hydrosphere is frozen, creating ice caps the world over. The planet's abundant sea life mostly goes dormant during this period but when Iona is close, its frozen oceans partially melt and the seas come to life.  Most [[#Akussanja]]n aquatic and amphibious life forms hibernate during the cold periods and become active only when they have significant heat from both stars. In addition, Iona casts its dim light on what is otherwise [[#Akussanja]]'s dark side.

The existence of native life is rare in red dwarf systems but [[#Akussanja]] has a complex ecosystem. It might have been more so if not for the interruption of a cataclysmic event approximately 500 million years ago, interrupting the equivalent of Terra's Devonian Era, thereby limiting the world's panoply of animals to aquatic and a few amphibious species.

The awakening is a very active period for the world's biosphere. As Iona comes close, animals burst into activity, consuming available plant and other animal life, mating and nesting. Amphibians and oceanic mammaloids race to build up much-needed body fats, which enable them to survive and extend their active period. The cycle of activity extends for nearly two years for most of the heterothermic species, long after the orbit of Iona has taken it to the far side of Blaukasa. As the cold increases, the animals return to hibernation for six to nine months.

The personnel at the scout base are present to observe and study the unusual [[#Akussanja]]n life forms. IISS scientists believe that studies of these creatures might have applications in the cryogenics field. The scouts have an uneasy partnership with [[SuSAG]], with whom they share governance of the world. [[SuSAG]] is present for much the same reason as the IISS but focuses on developing commercial products from their research.

From [[FTINVASIVE SPECIES|Invasive Species Adventure]]
[[#Akussanja]] is a frigid world and the Travellers are going to need cold-weather clothing and gear to operate in the wilderness. Refer to Arctic and Cold Environments on page 43 of the Central Supply Catalogue for a listing of appropriate kit. In addition to any of the items listed in this section, their patron provides them with an allowance of Cr10000 apiece to acquire other items they might need.

[[#Akussanja]] [[Downport]] is a utilitarian affair, designed to serve [[SuSAG]], the company that governs the planet and an array of subcontractor companies that provides services to the vastly larger megacorporation. The Scout Service maintains a base on the planet as well. The scout base was adjacent to the downport at one point in time but a falling out with [[SuSAG]] resulted in the scouts moving their operations to a new campus several kilometers away.

From [[Third Imperium]]

Akussanja hosts a variety of unusual life forms as a result of its unusual relationship with its red dwarf binary pair, Blaukasa and Iona. Like most worlds that orbit red dwarf stars, Akussanja is tidally locked, so one side of the planet always faces Blaukasa while the other faces away. Iona has an eccentric orbit, approximately 45o off the plane of the ecliptic. Approximately every 2.5 standard years, Iona comes close enough to Akussanja to have a significant effect on the planet. When distant, Akussanja's hydrosphere is frozen, creating ice caps nearly the world over. The planet's abundant sea life is mostly dormant during this period but when Iona is close, its frozen oceans partially melt and the seas come to life. Akussanjan fish hibernate during the cold periods and become active only when they have significant heat from both stars. In addition, Iona casts its dim light on what is otherwise Akussanja's dark side.

The Scout Service maintains a base in the system to observe the unusual Akussanjan life forms. IISS scientists believe that studies of the biochemistry of these creatures might have applications in the cryogenics field. After failed attempts to involve the [[Core sector]] 's Research Stations Beta and Gamma, the IISS extended offers to the corporate community and – much to their chagrin – drew the interest of SuSAG, which established a permanent presence on the planet. As it turns out, the IISS and SuSAG do not get along well and have recently stopped sharing their findings with each other. Most of the population on Akussanja are members of the Scout Service, employees of SuSAG, or workers from various companies present to support the two organizations. As the rift between the IISS and SuSAG has gotten worse, the service companies have found themselves caught in the middle. Accusations have been made on both sides that the service companies include spies for one side or the other. Unfortunately, the situation has continued to get worse and shows no signs of abating.
