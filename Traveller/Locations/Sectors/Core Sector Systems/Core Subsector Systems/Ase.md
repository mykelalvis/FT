**Ase** is a poor, non-agricultural, industrial, high-population desert hellworld, with a billion or more sophonts struggling to survive in a inhospitable environment.

- Hellworlds often offer daily, and sometimes hourly, life-threatening situations to their inhabitants. Survivors often form intense survival skills and tend to be grim realists.
- This world has no free-standing water.
- As an industrial world, this planet has well-developed manufacturing and processing industries. Manufactured goods are a major export item.
- It is unable to produce quality foodstuffs and must import them.
- Despite this world's industrial prowess, the world remains poor. Some blame it on the high prices of food, which must be imported. Others blame the nature of a hellworld. Whatever this reason, something needs to change in order for this world to prosper.
- This is a "high technology" world with technology achievements at, near, or over technology standards for [Charted Space](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Charted_Space "Charted Space").
- It is a member of the [[Third Imperium]] in the [[Core Subsector]] of [[Core Sector]] in the [[Domain of Sylea]].
- This world has a colony at [[Affinity]].

## History & Background (Dossier)


This world is part of the "Shaaaki Cluster" cultural zone. Shaaaki were the product of a hybrid Vilani-Solomani culture, and once prosperous. However, two centuries into the Imperial era, the environment of Shaaak (modern [[Syroe]] ) had become severely degraded by unbridled industry. Emperor Martin II deindustrialised the planet and ordered a mass emigration of the Shaaaki people to several nearby worlds, among them Ase.

### World Government

**Ase** is governed by a _Civil Service Bureaucracy_, the Resource Concordat.

The government leadership may select the bureaucracy leadership, but not its membership.
