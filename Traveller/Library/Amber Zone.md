# AMBER ZONE

An Amber Zone is a warning to Travellers. It may be an official warning from an interstellar polity, the world itself or it may be a classification of a private service such as the Traveller’s Aid Society. Conditions warranting an Amber Zone designation may include natural hazards, such as a corrosive or insidious atmosphere, very high pressures or temperatures, severe geologic activity or high risk of meteoric activity such as in a primordial star system. Human factors, including lack of a government or law enforcement, extremes of either or both, an ongoing war or civil disturbance may prompt an Amber Zone designation.

Travellers’ Aid Society classification for a nation, world or system which presents a need for caution in dealings and activities. The amber code may indicate chaos, upheaval or xenophobia in local business, politics, society, or culture, or may be applied for other reasons. Travellers should exercise caution when visiting an amber zone.
