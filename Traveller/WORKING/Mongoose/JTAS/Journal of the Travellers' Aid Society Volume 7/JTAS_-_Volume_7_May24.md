##### A Week in Jump

By Peter Simon

'Okay. The ship enters jumpspace...'

While making a transit through jumpspace the Travellers' ship is in a
bubble, unreachable and untouchable for a week. At the gaming table,
this time is often glossed over or only slightly remarked upon 'Does
anyone do anything besides maintenance and studying during jump'
Usually the ship transits from jumpspace without a hitch and onto its
next adventure.

However, with a little rolling on big tables, in true Traveller fashion you
can randomly spice up that time in jump.

THE ROUTINE OCCURRENCES
When a ship transits jumpspace there is a routine followed by crew
and passengers. The power plant is humming along, energising the
ship's computer, gravitics, internal comms and life support systems.
The business of the ship is taking place; anyone injured is being tended
to, crewmembers are standing watch, inspecting and maintaining
equipment, and honing ship-relevant skills.

Passengers and off-duty crew are also filling the hours; some are
exercising, working through study courses, plotting and scheming,
consuming media, immersing in games, enjoying hobbies or imbibing.
The truly self-motivated might be running 'do at home' businesses while
in jump. There might be socialising like a movie night, a story or lecture
from the steward, or a friendly card game.

This is all normal. What about not-normal

OUT OF THE ORDINARY AND STRANGER THINGS
The small plot points in the following tables are designed for later
(and optional) development by the Referee. The events are meant to
be broadly applicable to a small ship typical of Traveller adventures,
however your mileage may vary; the Referee may determine that a
given outcome could not possibly apply to the Travellers or simply
that the resulting roll does not feel right. Roll again, or pick one that
catches your eye.

Some of the events have origins in activities that took place prior to
jump and were only discovered at some point during the transit. There
are a few instances where possible 'big stuff' shows up in the results;
these events probably require roleplaying. If you would rather not do
this, feel free to ignore or dial-down the result.

Does Something Unusual Happen

THE FLAG OF ACIS
The flag of Acis features its two stars, Galatea and Polyphemus,
wrapped in a traditional Acisian chaplet; the wreath worn by members
of the Senate made from the leaves of the indigenous goldenbough
plant. The green and blue fields represent the earth and sky of Acis.

HISTORY
Acis (B885796-A) is one of the most continuously settled planets in
all of the Dustbelt, the narrow channel of star systems that stretches
across the Trojan Reach (also known as the Outrim Void). Its
breathable atmosphere, pleasant climate and active biosphere has
made it a welcoming home to humans for over 2,500 years, since it was
initially settled by Terran colonists.

The first settlers landed at the southern shores of the planet's largest
continent where the mouth of a river empties into one of its oceans.
The river was reddish brown due to the high iron and red phosphorus
content in the runoff of a nearby mountain range, the bloody colour of
the water inspiring the name of the region and eventually the planet
itself. In ancient Terran mythology, Acis, who loved the nereid Galatea,
was crushed by a boulder thrown by the jealous cyclops, Polyphemus.
Galatea, lamenting the loss of her lover, transformed his blood into
the River Acis. The mythological lore of Acis was extended to the
system's primary and secondary stars, which were named Galatea
and Polyphemus.

Galatea, a white-hot F7 V star, will have a shorter life span than
cooler dwarf stars. Most F-type stars burn their fuels too quickly to
develop the complex array of conditions required to foster life, even
when hospitable planets are in the star's habitable zone. Acis has
bucked that trend.

Prior to colonization, an advance team of planetologists studied
Acis and determined that the closest approximation of the planet's
geological age was the Devonian period of Terra (~400 million years
ago). The planet featured abundant sea life and a fairly complex
land-based ecosystem, dominated by amphibians. The flora was
rich, supported by Acis' size, hydrography and dense atmosphere.
In addition to its native biosphere, the presence of rich minerals and
nutrients in the planet's soil made it an ideal candidate to host a
veritable bounty of agricultural products.

Acis' 35o axial tilt exposes its poles to extreme temperature shifts and
results in distinct seasons in the temperate zones and a propensity for
deserts and steppes in the far northern and southern latitudes.

Galatea's far companion, Polyphemus, is a smouldering M2 V red
dwarf. The star is quite distant from the system primary, perched
far in the outer zone. With no planets of its own, Polyphemus rarely
receives visitors, leading a forlorn existence much like the creature from
which it derives its name. The star has negligible effects on all but the
outermost planetary bodies of the Acis system.

HE SAID, SHE SAID
In modern times, Acisian society is notable for its regimented gender
stratification. Occupations and appointed positions in society are strictly
managed by the Central Authority – the ruling government of Acis –
which determines each citizen's ability to perform a certain task or hold
a specific station based on their qualifications and gender.

For example, positions in government and politics are almost
exclusively the realm of females. Perceived to have calmer
demeanours, multi-tasking prowess and level-headedness, women

are deemed more suitable for the task of governance by Acisians. In
accordance with this belief, it is thought that females rarely decide
to go to war and when they do it is done for defensive reasons, not
imperialistic gain or resource exploitation. The veracity of such claims
may be doubtful, nevertheless this and similar beliefs have become
pillars of Acisian culture.

Men are assigned all roles requiring greater physical strength and
aggression. The military is completely staffed by males but is governed
by a female civilian authority. This is not to say that men are thought of
as brutes who are only good for hunting, killing and fighting. Far from
it. Acisian social science adheres to the belief that men are driven by
their desires in a more basic and atavistic way than women. This is
sublimated into the creation of competitive and aggressive businesses,
managing competitive projects, engaging in challenging scientific and
engineering careers in the realm of the free market and many other
such pursuits.

Acisian gender politics often appears draconian and unnecessarily
byzantine to offworlders. For example, the Secretary of the Army is
always a female position but the civilian position responsible for military
procurement is always held by a male. While the complex array of
gender stratification has created a web-like lattice of assignments;
many positions are neutral, open to either sex.

Procreation is not managed in any way by the government but
once children are born, they are assigned to a communal care and
development facility where they are raised and educated by a staff of
women. Once children reach maturity, they undergo secondary and
potentially university education, which is staffed almost entirely by men.
The early education program is where Acisian children are indoctrinated
into the concepts of gender-based society.

Acis is an agricultural world and while most of its plantations are near
urban areas, some are quite distant; children born in such areas are
sometimes not enrolled in communal education facilities. The Central
Authority regularly sends agents to communities to force adherence to
the system but there are pockets of resistance who manage to evade
them for extended periods of time. Notably, citizens who are not reared
at the educational facilities have a difficult time adjusting to cultural
norms if and when they join greater Acisian society.

The agricultural sector features a greater and more meticulous degree
of stratification and hierarchy than any other. Roles in Acis' lucrative
agribusiness are highly sought after and there is a great deal of
pressure to make many of the positions gender-neutral, regardless of
what the regulations dictate. Whilst the planting, fertilization and picking
of crops is primarily done by robots, there are millions of lucrative
careers in agriculture.

Acisian scholars have authored and maintained a complex library of
treatises on the subject of gender stratification. For centuries, Acis
strictly maintained its laws and guidelines in physical texts (books
and scrolls) that were reprinted every few years as amendments were
made. About a century ago, with technological improvements, Acis
stopped printing these and began uploading the texts to a secure
computer network.

Encrypted copies of the compendium are maintained on several
independent networks. In addition, the master compendium is uploaded
annually to an encrypted data storage device and transported aboard
an official vessel to an archive in the Albe system for safekeeping. The
original physical texts are now on permanent display in the Senate
building of the Acisian capitol.

The Central Authority is the ultimate arbiter of all vocational
assignments but a subordinate judicial authority exists to hear
challenges and protests. Reversals are rare but when an assignment
prohibition is strictly due to gender, they do offer one service to the
plaintiffs; sex-change surgery.

Sex-change surgeries are common on Acis and are not merely
cosmetic; they are complete physical alterations including the
removal and replacement of one's sex organs with those of the
other sex. This procedure is completely reversible and people often
have their sex changed multiple times during their lives. Acisian
medical technology has mastered these procedures, making them
as minimally invasive as possible.

Operations are performed primarily to enable citizens to pursue their
desired vocational assignments but many people have sex changes
for other reasons. Sometimes an individual born as a man wants
to become a woman to experience childbirth. Sometimes a woman
wants to serve as a member of the military. The reasons are many. In
addition to female and male sex operations, some individuals choose a
hermaphroditic configuration. Whilst hermaphrodites are less common
than traditional females and males, they are common enough that the
Central Authority has developed a decidedly scientific approach to
vocational assignments for the hermaphroditic portion of the population,
with exacting measurements of hormone levels used as the primary
arbiter to determine eligibility for various assignments.

More liberally minded visitors often decry the inherent sexism of Acisian
culture but the citizens of Acis are for the most part content with their
practices. In the chaotic environment that comprises the Dustbelt, they
believe that their stratified and carefully managed society represents a
sea of calm amongst an otherwise chaotic and dysfunctional community
of star systems.

WHO'S THE BOSS
Acis' obsession with gender and occupational assignments has resulted
in a bloated, inefficient bureaucracy, that has offices for everything
from the development of irrigation resources to a Czar of Scaled
Murmins, a highly fecund amphibious species that requires a great deal
of management. In a society driven by the urge to assign everyone a
role, it is easy to go overboard. The overindulgent appointment of the
population to management roles is diametrically opposed to an alleged
culture of 'individuality and liberty'. Despite the apparent contradictions,
Acisians manage to make it work.

Economists at Acis City's Miglardia University believe that the
dichotomy of Acisian culture is a symptom of a post-scarcity society
caught in the throes of interstellar capitalism and colonial avarice.
While most Acisians live a nice life and want for little, their presence in
the Dustbelt and the threat of war with Tyr has stunted their ability to
progress to the next phase of civilization.

In addition to their own highly overstaffed government, Acis is well known
for employing councillors from Thalassa. Thalassans are renowned for
their ability to predict the future using a complex array of closely guarded
algorithms and have been employed in politics and business. They have
however been shunned by the military, who see them as 'fortune tellers
and charlatans'. Nevertheless, many power brokers on Acis attribute
much of their success to the use of Thalassan counsel.

##### Mortal Enemies

Acis currently has its own army and planetary navy, which have
vastly grown in recent decades. Acis, like most worlds of the
Dustbelt, was oppressed by the Tyrian Lordships for centuries.
Over the course of history, Acis had mostly resisted the urge to fight
their imperialistic and ravenous neighbor, preferring instead to
acquiesce to the raiders' demands.

Tyr's dominance of the region was only sporadically and incidentally
felt on Acis. As the 'golden child' of the Sindalian Main, Acis was rarely
raided and was allowed to be relatively autonomous, provided that
gratuitous shipments of agricultural products were donated to the Tyrian
Lordships on a regular basis.

The Central Authority did what it could to maintain a buffer zone
between the people of Acis and their Tyrian oppressors. Under the ruse
that they were 'establishing reserves', the government collected product
from the agricorps, neatly tucking it away at the downport so that it
could be surreptitiously 'donated' to Tyrian raiding ships whenever they
made planetfall to collect their 'tribute'. The true cost was hidden from
the majority of the populace until a large volcanic eruption on one of
Acis' island chains put enough particulate matter into the atmosphere to
cause a decades long decrease in agricultural output.

When the people called for the government to use the reserves to
lighten the impact, there were no reserves to be found, all of it was
taken by the Tyrians. The scandal rocked the Central Authority to its
core, forcing them to change their relationship with Tyr and take a more
aggressive stance against their oppressor.

A resistance movement began to develop on Acis, which after being
mostly ignored by Tyr eventually became perilous. Tyr would occasionally
recruit skilled and able-bodied spacers from worlds of the Dustbelt to
serve on the starships of the Tyrian Main Defence Forces, really just a
euphemism for 'raiders with capital ships'. This practice became Tyr's
Achilles' heel when conscripted Acisian NCOs serving on a Kæsia-class
destroyer mutinied and took control of the ship as it orbited Acis (see
Naval Adventure 3 Fire On The Sindalian Main, page 44). Tyr deployed
three other Kæsias to the system in short order, leaving their defences
dangerously thin elsewhere. The three ships destroyed the one taken by
Acis but not without suffering severe battle damage.

The citizens of Acis feared the worst. The pillaging of the Janus
system by Tyrian raiders had not been forgotten by elderly Acisian
citizens. Expecting an orbital bombardment from the three weary and
wounded Kæsias, Acis was surprised when, for the first time in its
history, Tyr opted to occupy and actively oppress a world instead of
punitively bombing it from orbit. Despite the fury of the Tyrian officer

corps, the Lordships recognized that Acis was too valuable to destroy.
As an agricultural powerhouse and key to Tyr's survival, destroying or
disabling Acis would have been like cutting off one's own foot.

Tyr implemented a brutal counterinsurgency program on Acis,
prosecuting their officer corps, government officials and business
leaders in an attempt to weed out the insurgency. While the majority
of the actors in the revolt managed to flee to Delta Theta and Colony
Six, the Lordships left no stone unturned on Acis, spying on, torturing
and executing thousands of Acisian citizens in a pique of fury. Without
enough soldiers of their own to police the planet, Tyr hired dozens of
mercenary bands for the job, often employing the lowest of the low,
some of whom barely more than aggrandised thugs, which is only a
slight downgrade from the Tyrian raiders themselves.

Far from quashing the resistance, these actions only steeled Acis'
resolve to rid themselves of the Tyrians once and for all. Working with
the exiled militia officers and politicians, the Acis resistance schemed
for years, seeking a way to rid themselves of Tyr's yoke. They appealed
to the Imperium, seeking Client State status, but were rebuffed. Having
only recently ended the Fourth Frontier War, the Imperium was not
keen on investing in dubious independent systems in the Outrim
Void. With nowhere else to turn, the community of resistors and exiles
hatched a plan to hire Aslan mercenaries from the Glorious Empire to
aid their cause.

After some early setbacks, the Aslan were magnificently successful,
decimating Tyr's forces wherever they found them and ultimately taking
the battle to the Tyr system itself. Here they effectively crippled the
government and nearly dismantled the vaunted Tyrian shipyards, the
only facility along the entire Dustbelt that could build jump-capable
spacecraft. During the course of the war, Acis' military forces became
gradually more powerful, aiding and abetting the Aslan war effort
where they could. While the Acis Defence Forces have since become
reasonably capable of defending their homeworld, they cannot claim to
have the effectiveness or martial expertise of the Aslan.

The Glorious Empire was fortunate that the opportunity arose. Beset
from all sides by their brethren in the Aslan Hierate, losing one system
after another in a devastating war of attrition, they had virtually nowhere
to turn. Their centuries-old culture had begun to recognize that the
distant murmur they were hearing was the approach of their own death
knell. The victorious campaigns of their mercenaries in the Dustbelt
gave them new life, with the mercenary forces contributing to the
Empire's economy and giving its people something to aspire to.

Basking in the glow of victory and liberated from Tyrian authority, this
should be a golden age for Acis. However, it appears that Acis has
gradually opened a Pandora's Box of sorts. The newly inspired Glorious

Empire has been given a taste of conquest. While Empire mercenaries
have had to sublimate their desire for new lands with monetary riches,
the fact remains that they were instrumental in winning the war. Having
been so crucial to the war effort, it is not much of a stretch for the
Empire to imagine coming back to this war-torn region, this time not as
soldiers of fortune but as conquerors.

Acis knows this situation is untenable and is desperately seeking a
way to divert the Aslan mercenary legions before things take a turn for
the worse. At the moment, it is not clear to whom they should turn for
help. Rumor has it a cabal of contrarian politicians and their Thalassan
councillors are recommending the unthinkable; an alliance with Tyr.

The future of Acis is difficult to predict. While Acis is free of Tyrian
control, government officials are concerned that they may have invited
new oppressors – the Glorious Empire Aslan – into their midst. The
Central Authority has great hopes for the prospects of their world. A
key stop along the Florian Route, the world sees a great deal of traffic
from both the Imperium and the Florian League. Acisian merchants
hope to establish ties with the clans of the Aslan Hierate via the
interface world of Akhwohkyal.

##### Advanced Lasers

By Andrew Benton

More advanced beam and pulse lasers can be mounted within
weapon bays, granting higher damage potential than their smaller
counterparts. Whilst lasers are commonly used as low-level firepower
during ship combat, the bay and barbette versions are viable as
primary or secondary ship weapons. Now having filtered down to the
smaller navies of the Trojan Reach, such as the raiders of Oghma or
system defence boats of Dpres, lasers are a likely option for the few
larger warships they might construct. These may not be used for Point
Defence, as the size of the weapon bays makes them too unwieldy to
aim at smaller targets.

##### Deepnight Revelation Character Creation

By Steven Hammond

Spoiler alert This article may have minor spoilers to the Deepnight
Revelation campaign. You should skip it if you are hoping to take part in
the campaign as a Traveller.

The release of Deepnight Revelation provides a structure where
merging play and Traveller creation can really shine. The epic
campaign takes the Travellers on a 20-year voyage beyond Charted
Space. Along the way they will see wondrous sites, encounter strange
beasts and engage with aliens – all while facing an existential threat
to the galaxy. An epic science fiction story like this deserves Travellers
that are tailor made for the experience.

THE SETUP
By default, the campaign opens with the Travellers being thrown
together for an emergency resupply of an outpost deep in the Rift. The
original supply ship has failed to return and officials are worried about
the ship and people at the outpost. When the Travellers arrive at the
outpost, they encounter the threat that becomes the focus of the rest of
the campaign.

Concerned about this threat, the Imperium contracts space exploration
company Deepnight to put together an expedition to Terminus Point,
a radio source determined to be the origin of the threat. Unfortunately,
that location is some 10 years away. A partially de-militarised 75,000-
ton Amara-class cruiser for the voyage and a select crew of 500 are
gathered for this epic adventure.

After surviving their initial encounter with the threat, the Travellers are
now the 'experts' in dealing with it. They can choose whatever roles
they want on the expedition, from command to mid-level officers, to a
group of trouble-shooting 'Ripleys' embedded in the crew.

THE CHALLENGES
The expected roles for the Travellers may take a certain amount of
disbelief suspension. Why would Deepnight or the Imperium hand
command of a major warship to a group of random Travellers The
answer, of course, is that the story is about the Travellers and it is more
fun for them to make the major expedition decisions.

After the incident that triggers the expedition, it takes time for scientists
to work out the source of the problem. Then the Imperium has to find
a suitable ship and retrofit it. According to the campaign's description
of the ship, retrofit work starts in 1098, trials start in 1102 and the
expedition starts in 1105. Tack a year onto the beginning for the
research and there is an eight-year span between the Imperium starting
preparation for the expedition and its launch.

The default assumption is that the Imperium knew about the threat
ahead of time, perhaps from the incident described in Great Rift
Adventure 2 Deepnight Endeavor. Thus the ship is complete and the
expedition is finalising preparations as the Travellers encounter the
threat during the opening adventure of the campaign. Again, the timing
here requires a certain suspension of disbelief.

##### Solutions

To be clear, suspension of disbelief like this is not uncommon in fiction;
roleplaying games in particular. Certain roles and activities make for
better stories, so gloss over getting the protagonists into those roles.

The eight-year span needed to get the ship ready for the expedition
opens up another possibility. If we tweak the Traveller creation process,
we can remove the timing coincidence and create more suitable
Travellers. Eight years is, conveniently, two terms and we can take
advantage of this with the following adjustments

1. Brief the Travellers. Explain the adjustments to the Traveller
    creation process, so they understand what is going to happen.
    Do not reveal any details about the voyage or the initial incident.
    Explain enough to ensure that you have buy in from the Travellers
    for this sort of campaign, and that they understand events will
    interrupt Traveller creation. You also probably want to warn them
    away from concepts and backstories that tie to individuals and
    locations in the Imperium. Those will be left far behind and not be a
    factor in the campaign. They can assume any career they want, but
    should have reasons to take a 20-year journey into the unknown.
2. Enter the Traveller creation process as normal. As the
    Travellers progress through their careers, be thinking about how
    any friends and enemies come to be part of the expedition. Again,
    any who are not are likely wasted opportunities that get left behind.
3. The Travellers need to make the decision to end their
    careers two terms before they actually want to quit. If a
    Traveller wants to begin adventuring after five terms, they need to
    make that decision after term three. Once they hit this point, they
    should stop and not play out the last two terms of their career.
4. Now play Deepnight Legacy with the unfinished Travellers.
    Authorities divert the Travellers from whatever careers they have to take
    part in the emergency resupply mission. Scout or Navy Travellers receive
    orders to go, a Merchant company is contacted to make the run, a Rogue
    or Noble might simply be bored in the wrong place at the right time.
5. Survivors drop back into Travellers creation. As survivors of the
    incident, the Imperium and Deepnight Corporation recruit the Travellers
    for the mission. The Travellers can discuss what roles they want on the
    ship. They essentially have a 'golden ticket' to the career assignment of
    their choice, as they are groomed for that role. That golden ticket means
    their Qualification roll to enter a new career automatically succeeds.
    They also receive DM+2 to any one commission roll. Referees might
    want to limit this to careers that the Imperium or Deepnight reasonably
    have influence over. Hopefully, at this point the Travellers are engaged
    with the story and you can give them free rein.
6. New Travellers replace those who do not survive. If any of the
    Travellers die during the events of Deepnight Legacy, then they
    should be replaced. This Traveller was recruited straight after
    school for the mission and so can make career choices to prepare
    for it; they will serve exactly two terms before the mission starts.

7. Play out the final two terms, then stop. The Imperium and
    Deepnight will bring selected expedition members together for
    conferences and joint training. This provides an opportunity for
    roleplaying and to connect any new friends or enemies with the
    expedition. Once the two terms are complete, it is time for the
    expedition to depart and play picks up with that part of the campaign.

##### Other Optional Tweaks

Here are a few more optional tweaks you can apply.

MOTIVATED BY THE MISSION
The events of Deepnight Legacy could really motivate a Traveller for
the mission. During the Traveller's final two terms, they can choose
to receive DM+1 for advancement rolls and can make skill rolls twice,
taking whichever result they prefer. On the downside, they suffer DM-1
to Survival rolls because of the extra risks they are taking.

PSI TRAINING
If, during Deepnight Legacy, one Traveller is found to be sensitive,
they can roll their PSI characteristic and enroll in the Psion career. This
could either be at a secret Imperium psi research facility or training the
Traveller sought on their own.

CHARM CHARACTERISTIC
As so much of the campaign occurs outside Charted Space, Social
Standing does not necessarily mean as much as it normally would.
Referees might want to consider replacing SOC with Charm (CHA)
as described on page 10 of the Traveller Companion. Any reference
to SOC during Traveller creation becomes CHA. If a Traveller wants
to be a charismatic 'face', they can replace one item on the Personal
Development skill table with CHA +1, if their career's table does not
already have a SOC +1 entry. Rogues and Merchants in particular
might warrant this treatment.

SOC could be kept if Referee wishes or Travellers can select an
appropriate SOC if it is important to their role.

DEEPNIGHT REVELATION SKILL PACKAGE
This is a skill package targeted at Travellers taking part in the
_expedition, representing mission specific training received prior to_
departure. This package should be awarded as the last stage of the
second round of character creation, after playing Deepnight Legacy.

Skills Diplomat 1, Drive (wheeled) 1, Heavy Weapons 1, Leadership 1,
Medic 1, Science 1, Survival 1, Vacc Suit 1

##### Integration of Deepnight Endeavor

There are three ways to integrate the Great Rift Adventure 2 Deepnight
Endeavor. The first, and probably least appealing, would be to have
it occur during the first reach of Deepnight Revelation's voyage. This
could give a sense of urgency to the mission but may not be a good
thing if it dissuades exploration along the way.

The second possible integration would be to connect it directly to
the events of Deepnight Legacy. Perhaps the Endeavor stopped at
Alpha and departed before realising the spores infected them. The
Travellers, on the Hauler, could encounter Endeavor as they stop
for the first refuelling en route to Alpha. However, it would probably be
more interesting if they encounter Endeavor on the return trip after it
destroys the refuelling station.

You will need a larger group of Travellers for the third integration idea.
This would be to split them up for the first mission. Half do Deepnight
Legacy and the other half Deepnight Endeavor. The Imperium brings
survivors from both missions together for the expedition to Terminus
Point. There would be some really great roleplaying opportunities as
the groups interact, compare notes and sort out roles on the extended
voyage. You probably need six Travellers to make this work but might
also supplement the groups with an NPC or two. Those NPCs will
probably be wearing red shirts...

##### Dr. Izikai Nafir

By Tim Heiderich

You may not know his name but you know the work of cyberneticist Dr.
Izikai Nafir. Despite an early and unremarkable career as a physician,
the doctor single-handedly developed a neural integration technique,
years ahead of current research, which took the cybernetics world by
storm. You're probably using his invention right now!

The researcher you may not have heard of is Dr. Leitz-Myer. Dr. Nafir's
residency at a planetary hospital in the Imperium would have been a
historical footnote were it not for the intervention of his close university
colleague. It was Dr. Leitz-Myer who requested Nafir's participation
in a secretive research project on advanced cybernetic cellular
augmentation but, when the project was concluded, her name was
curiously absent from any resulting patents.

Never the sentimental type, Dr. Nafir had brokered the sale of their
research without the knowledge of his former colleague, keeping the
profits and esteem for himself. Leveraging the newfound prestige from
his discovery, Dr. Nafir sought out greater research opportunities to
expand his reputation. His reputation was instrumental in boosting
attention and funding for projects he attached himself to, which in
turn earned him a large portion of credit and profits. Using these
spoils to purchase a laboratory ship he christened Honeywell, the
entrepreneurial Dr. Nafir was undiscerning in attracting his own clients
the desperate and foolhardy, scientists short on funding, researchers
with fringe theories, those looking for 'miracle' cures or scientists
performing research either unsavory or illegal. Hopping from system-
to-system for new 'marks', Nafir continues his career supplementing his
own work with research stolen from others, making him a successful,
prestigious scientist with a suspicious history.

Ever excitable and complimentary, Dr. Nafir appears recklessly
credulous for a scientist, embracing curious and unproven theories with
a conviction that is difficult to question. In conversation, he is overly
flattering and self-aggrandising to those he may be able to exploit, yet
condescending and dismissive to his critics. He puts his diplomacy and
carousing abilities to use searching out new benefactors, either from
trusting sponsors or fellow scientists.

Given to wearing retro-style academic suits, mismatched against his
wild, unkempt hair and crooked grin, the doctor commands attention
by presenting himself as exactly what a layperson thinks a brilliant
scientist would look like. His rigid posture and unusual grooming speak

to his pomposity and self-
assuredness, which is exactly
what draws inexperienced and
easily-led benefactors to him.

Travellers may meet him as he
journeys through rich systems
looking for investment funds in
whatever unproven technology
he is forever on the verge of
breaking through. He is willing
to cut a deal for passage or
access to his laboratory ship
for people with interesting
data, artifacts or research.
Often he will have 'just the
thing' that a researcher in a
tight spot will need.

His ship boasts state-of-the-art
laboratory facilities, used by
himself and his passengers
but what his passengers do
not know is that all sensors,
data monitors and networks
are wired back into the ship's
main computer, for Dr. Nafir
to cherry-pick as he pleases,
either to take credit for his
passengers' work or sell to
interested parties by way of his
diplomatic connections.

Despite always being on the move, Dr. Nafir's past does sometimes
catch up with him and Travellers in his wake are likely to meet his
nemesis Dr. Leight-Myer, an unassuming and introverted woman with
a desperate plea that the more famous doctor stole her work. She will
reward those who expose Dr. Nafir as a fraud and ruin his reputation.
Leight-Myer knows that Nafir is reckless in his experiments and may
be in possession of knowledge or equipment that is dangerous in
his hands, which must be returned or destroyed. Destroying his ship
in a raid would be unsavory, as Nafir tends to travel with dozens of
scientists and Dr. Leitz-Myer does not want blood on her hands.

There are maybe a dozen other scientists or researcher organizations,
who have also been taken advantage of by the good doctor, looking
for the return of stolen data and information on what he might have
done with it. This can lead Travellers to an infiltration mission on
the Honeywell and then onto deeper intrigue once the stolen data
is uncovered. The temptation to resell this data may be great or its
implications may change the Travellers' goals.

##### Golden Dawn Yacht

By C. Urs Wohlthat

The Third Imperium has the Type-Y yacht and the Type-K safari ship as
toy ships for its nobility and the worlds of the former Sindalian Empire
have the Golden Dawn. These ships are as renowned for their luxurious
accommodations as they are notorious for their design choices in the
crew areas. Their iconic step-level design features the splendid glass
prow followed by the lounge deck. On the rear of the lounge deck is a
corridor connecting the bridge and engineering deck which are stacked
above each other in the ship's aft-section.

Initially designed during the last days of the Sindalian Empire, they were
built to TL12 standard, featuring matured technologies such as energy
efficient jump and maneuver drives, with basic armor and basic
armament. Featuring upwards folding aerofins, the Golden Dawn is well-
suited to land on all planetoids, including those with atmospheres.

LOUNGE DECK
Intended to serve a single member of the Sindalian aristocracy or an
envoy, the Golden Dawn features a single luxury stateroom, eight
additional standard staterooms and a medical bay connected by a
hallway to the main airlock and the huge lounge in the prow-section
of the yacht. The main feature of this master lounge is not its grand
panorama glass, allowing stunning views while landed on or orbiting a
world, but the extendable deck with built in cover that can be rolled out
to host breakfast or dinner on this not-so impromptu patio. This feature
alone is said to have contributed to numerous members of the post-
Sindalian aristocracy to permanently reside in their yachts, as they visit
world upon world of the Sindalian Main, the Borderlands or the Drinax
Chain. More than one noble has been known to use the extractable
patio to give speeches from, after their servants had cleared the tables.

The aerodynamic winglets, which are front mounted as canards and
fold upwards after landing, allow for hawsers to be attached to stabilize
the patio and act as a durable cover proof against both wind and sun,
as well as keeping pestering camera drones away.

AFT DECKS
Behind the passenger section begins the technical and engineering
areas of the ship. The differences in design and cost allocations could
not create a starker contrast. Technically still on the lounge deck, but

already in the technical section, are a secondary airlock leading onto
the dorsal hull and the entrance to the ventral turret. Above these are
the vehicle hangars, normally featuring an air-raft and two g-bikes.

The lower engineering deck features several fuel tanks, a workshop,
all drives and the power plant. The staff lounge is cramped compared
to the lounge deck, and is notorious for its small bridge, barely offering
enough room for the four workstations of the pilot, astrogator and two
gunners, the engineer serving one deck lower. The bridge also has
the unusual feature of being off center to starboard while also hosting
access to the dorsal turret.

One feature genuinely liked by the crew of these yachts is their
dedicated crew lounge, which sits to port of the bridge (it is in fact the
reason for the small size of the bridge) and features a similar, although
only half sized and angled, glassed front to the lounge deck below.
This allows the crew to enjoy quite a view during their off-time and
sometimes impresses new hands enough to sign on before they look
too closely around the rest of the ship.

FAMOUS OWNERS AND ROLES OF USAGE
The ships of this class can escape most dangers, due to their powerful
drives, allow for ample eight weeks of power plant operations and
enable passengers to move about their destination worlds without
having to rent local vehicles. On the downside, these ships cost more
than their Type-Y or Type-K rivals and given the almost non-existent
cargo hold, the class is not commercially viable.

All in all, the Golden Dawn is a beautiful ship, although mostly for its
passengers. It still enjoys a niche existence where the post-Sindalian
nobility loves to show off wealth and splendour. Best known for this
behaviour is Lord Afle Urelad, who stylises himself as Lord of Port
Amalgo and journeys aboard his Port of Amalgo. Amalgo is the Sindalian
name of the world now known as Arunisiir, clearly laying claim on a world
lost to Aslan ihatei long before Lord Urelad was born. Unsurprisingly,
Lord Urelad is a known follower of the Grehai Movement.

Another famous user of the Golden Dawn is the ruler of Yggdrasil, the
Golden Queen herself. The current Supreme Goddess Incarnate and
Mother of Water, as her other titles go, owns not one but two ships
of this class, one of which she apparently had to permanently lend
to her greatest rival, the Humble Representative of Yggdrasil, a title
which denominates the envoy of the planet's population to her court.
In the past, most of these representatives have not been so humble
but instead used taxes levied from Imperial commerce and the strong
support of their people to wrestle most control over politics from the
Golden Queen's ancestors. Unfortunately, the queen's own yacht
seems to be in a state of disrepair.

Rumors also report the type being used as a pirate vessel, a role for
which the class is well suited due to its powerful drives. Pirate captains
will want to ditch some or all the onboard vehicles or else be restricted
to kidnapping raids or strapping loot onto the hull.

AVAILABILITY AND VARIANTS
The Golden Dawn can be constructed by most shipyards attached
to Class A starports of TL12 or higher. Some shipyards of lower Tech
Levels are known to offer variants that feature less powerful drives
and entry-level power plants. As low-tech equipment often displaces
more internal space, these variants often ditch the vehicle hangars or
downgrade the jump drive. Worlds where these downgraded variants
are available – colloquially known as Gilded Dawn – include Pourne,
Salif, Tanith and Tyr.

CASES
There are a number of cases available from Initial 24 Armaments, and
each can be customised to the Traveller's whims. They come with a
combination of weapons, attachments and assorted miscellaneous
items that would be useful for anyone having a rough time within
Charted Space. All cases come with a handy booklet guide to the
usage of the equipment inside, as well as a holster to carry all
weapons provided!

Potential customers should check with local law enforcement, as on
many planets the cases are classified as survival equipment instead
of weaponry. As long as they are locked or sealed, they may be kept
in homes or vehicles until disaster strikes. A small licence fee may
apply. This may not apply to 'Go Tactical' cases, which have stricter
restrictions on ownership and usage.

STANDARD CASES
Available at all Initial 24 Armaments retailers, these cases are standard
design for any Traveller wishing to be prepared for an emergency. All
kits come in a foam-fitted waterproof plastic case, with a combined
combinationkey lock. Initial 24 cases are available in any colour
desired, as well as being armored and internally structured such that
they can be driven over by an ATV and receive minimal damage.

All standard cases can be upgraded to a 'Pro' case which includes a TL8
laser sight for an additional Cr200. If the case already contains a TL8
laser sight, at a supplementary cost of Cr280, Travellers can upgrade the
case to incorporate a suppressor and two smoke grenades.

##### Ithklur

By Christopher Griffen

The Hive Federation truly lives up to its name. Dominated by the Hivers
themselves, who make up nearly half of its population, the Federation
consists of 170 sophont species and counting, most of whom have
been 'manipulated' to serve one purpose or another. While some
ascribe a degree of nefarious intent to Hivers and their manipulations,
one might argue that they are merely effective facilitators. Each
Federation species has a role to fulfil, often overlapping those of other
member species, meaning the whole has become greater than the sum
of its parts. Regardless of the means the Hivers have employed, no
other major interstellar polity in Charted Space so fully embraces the
notions of diversity and collaboration.

Among the most populous of its member species are the Ithklur, who
serve as the Federation's primary ground forces and ship's troops. The
Ithklur are fearsome warriors, known for their effectiveness, toughness
and ruthlessness in battle. However, to dismiss the Ithklur as simply
soldiers of the Federation would be an understatement. Everything
that the Ithklur are and every aspect of their lives is an expression
of integrity, honesty and duty. They are the most ardent warrior-
philosophers in Charted Space.

##### History of the Ithklur

The Ithklur originated on the world of Tryylin (a Gurvin name), called
Eethkkla in the language of the Ithklur. The date when they achieved
civilization is unknown but when the Hivers made first contact with them
in -3986, they had independently achieved space flight and were in the
process of colonising the other worlds of their star system.

The Hivers had already subsumed many other Minor Races and were in
various states of manipulating and incorporating them into the growing
Federation. The existential shock of finding out that one is not the only
intelligent species in the universe is taken differently by each species,
and to say that the Ithklur took it well would be grossly inaccurate. Prone
to aggression, the Ithklur turned on their visitors and attacked them. After
rebuffing the Hiver ambassadors, the Ithklur developed plans to colonize
surrounding star systems via sublight generation ships but, for whatever
reason, this did not occur. After a few centuries, they were pacified by the
Hivers and brought into the Federation peacefully.

Ithklur is the Gurvin word for 'shock troops', which describes the
role they fill for the Federation. Whilst other species also serve in
the Federation military, the Ithklur are its primary army and marine

forces. Accepting this role seems to suit the Ithklur well, although they
did make cultural sacrifices in the process, as shall be seen in the
following passages. As far as the Ithklur are concerned, it is they who
manipulated the Hivers, not the other way around. By being resistant
to pacification, the Hivers were 'forced' to accept the aggressive nature
of the Ithklur and the most expedient solution was to allow them to do
what they do best in service to the Federation.

The Ithklur gave up pursuit of technological growth, instead allowing
the far more advanced Hivers to provide weapons for warfare and
transportation to wherever they were needed. In addition to serving
throughout Federation space, the Ithklur have been allowed to
dominate two cultural zones, one surrounding Tryylin, which includes
15 star systems in Extolian sector, and the Ithklur Aexzz, a larger polity
of 40 star systems spread across four sectors just outside the borders
of the Federation. The latter serves the dual purpose of giving the
Ithklur an independent polity and buffer state against potential human
or K'kree aggression on the spinward-coreward frontier.

NATURAL BORN KILLERS
The Ithklur are descended from arboreal carnivorepouncers. Their rather
large size (adults average 200 kilograms) is indicative of the other native
species of Tryylin, many of which are massive. Primordial Ithklur evolved
to hunt in packs to bring down considerably larger prey, much of which
resembled Mesozoic-era Terran fauna. As the climate of their homeworld
changed and they were forced out of their forested homelands, the Ithklur
adapted well to new and more varied environments.

Ithklur are often described as 'reptilian', due to their tails and scaly skin,
but they are in fact more similar to mammals in most regards, including
the fact that they are homeothermic and have internal skeletons. They
have two sexes but other than reproductive organs, females and males
are similar in size and physique. Ithklur are long-limbed and stand upright
but tend to amble in a semi-quadrupedal manner, their knuckles and

tails low to the ground to maintain balance and enhance lateral mobility.
Ithklur lean on their thick, stubby tails in tripod fashion when standing at
rest. Their tails have bony protrusions, enabling them to serve as a club
in close quarters, although they incur DM-2 when used in melee.

Colouration is mostly tan or brown but can also be green or blue. Ithklur
hands are large and powerful with three fingers and an opposable
thumb. Their feet have four forward-facing toes and a rear heel claw.
Each of the fingers and toes is clawed and may be used as a weapon.
Their legs are digitigrade.

Ithklur have paired infrared sensory organs where human nostrils are
located. This gives them a 'heat sense', which operates well in all but total
darkness. These organs alter their perception of colour, enabling them
to perceive a broader range than humans and detect subtle temperature
differences at a range of up to 50 meters. It can be used to detect living
beings, individual heat maps and changes in temperature. They have highly
sensitive olfactory senses as well, with nostrils located at each temple.

Their respiratory systems feature paired lungs with three lobes each.
They have two cardiovascular organs, one which pumps arterial blood
throughout the body and the other receives blood from body tissues
and filters it back into the arterial cardiovascular organ. Their digestive
systems are simpler than those of Humaniti, efficiently extracting nutrients
from meat but with little ability to process vegetable matter. Their waste-
processing organs are highly developed, enabling them to process fluids
and remove toxins in a more efficient manner than humans.

Reproductive organs are similar to those of humans but Ithklur infants are
delivered through a ventral slit just above the pelvis. Ithklur infants gestate for
a period of nearly 17 standard months but are born almost fully developed,
capable of walking within hours and able to consume meat immediately.

SOPHONT, INTERRUPTED
Primordial Ithklur were pack animals that worked together to bring
down large prey. As a result, they evolved into a highly cooperative
and inquisitive species that works together to solve problems and
accomplish goals. Ithklur are boisterous and physical with one
another, behaviours which they often unwittingly impose upon other
species. They embrace and body check each other aggressively,
which is all well and good between fellow Ithklur, however when
smaller, less physically inclined sophonts are the recipients of such,
misunderstandings (and injuries) may result.

Injurious greetings might well be an evolutionary remnant of
establishing their place in a pack but other aspects of their culture may
have been manipulated out of them by the Hivers. Unlike humans,
who evolved so long-term relationships between mates increased
the survival chances of their offspring, the Ithklur have no such

requirement. Males and females are physically comparable and their
young are viable, mobile and able to eat the same food as adults
virtually from birth. There is little need for long-term relationships
between parents to exist; nevertheless monogamous marriage between
adult female and male Ithklur is the cultural norm in modern times. This
is likely the result of a Hiver manipulation to enhance stability in Ithklur
society, however the Ithklur are loathed to admit that. They believe that
pair bonding and monogamy were natural adaptations to their rapid
conversion into an interstellar species.

Ithklur culture and behaviour changed significantly after their
introduction to the Federation community but it is not always clear
which aspects changed by manipulation and which by adaptation.
They have a love of sports – especially contact sports – which seems
to have developed after the arrival of the Hivers. While participation in
sport seems to have done little to curb their appetites for violence and
killing, it may have been an early attempt by the Hivers to sublimate
their urges. Sports in human and other societies are often an analogy
for violence and warfare. In Ithklur society, they seem to be in
preparation for it.

Ithklur love of trinkets, ornamentation, art and pets (domesticated or
otherwise) are behaviours which the Ithklur have exhibited since pre-
contact times. Those of the Guardian path decorate their weapons and
armor intricately; carving, painting and encrusting them with various
trinkets. Their military garb often lacks what humans would consider
appropriate camouflage. The Ithklur rely more upon their senses of
smell and infrared than vision. Overly focusing on colour alone seems
pointless to them, whilst proper ornamentation is vital. It is both a
morale booster and a way to establish one's unique identity.

There are two perceivable social strata in Ithklur society the
Elementary and the Enlightened. The vast majority of Ithklur are
Elementary and fill the ranks of society. Being Elementary does
not necessarily indicate a lack of interest in philosophy or the arts;
merely that their interest and depth of knowledge is more basic. The
Enlightened have reached a higher plateau of wisdom and are looked
upon as leaders, although all members of Ithklur society have the ability
to become Enlightened.

Despite the alleged effectiveness of the Hivers' manipulation of the
Ithklur, the two species have a somewhat adverse relationship. While
the Ithklur are quite willing to serve as the Federation's shock troops,
they are often insubordinate and derisive towards the Hivers. Ithklur
continue to speak their native language in spite of Federation decrees
to adopt Gurvin. They flout Hiver authority by alternately pranking
and terrifying them. For their part, the Hivers profess that enduring
such indignities is a small price to pay for the security and offensive
capabilities provided by their Ithklur Federation brethren.

The following sections
describe how to create
Ithklur Travellers. They follow
the same aging rules as
Humaniti (see Traveller Core
Rulebook, page 48). As they
are a member of the Hive
Federation, they replace
SOC with Resolve (RES) as
Hivers do.

CHARACTERISTICS
Ithklur Travellers determine
STR, DEX, END and INT
by rolling 2D for each
characteristic, with EDU
rolled on 1D+1.

The following modifiers are
applied to the characteristics
of all Ithklur STR +1, END+1.

RES is used by Ithklur to
measure determination under
difficult circumstances and as
their primary characteristic for
social skills such as Carouse,
Diplomat and Leadership.
Ithklur RES is rolled on 1D+1.
RES takes on a different
meaning among the Ithklur
and is primarily used during
Traveller creation to determine
if they achieve Enlightenment
over the course of their
careers. If at the end of
each completed term of
service they have made their
Advancement roll during that
term, Travellers gain RES+1.
This reflects enhanced
mastery of their chosen path
and increased opportunity to
gain Enlightenment.

##### Creating an Ithklur Traveller

ITHKLUR TRAITS
Ithklur Travellers all possess the following traits

Claws The Ithklur have clawed hands and feet, either of which can
be used as weapons. Their claws use the Melee (natural) skill doing
1D+2 damage.

Club The Ithklur have a bony tail that can be used as a club for 2D
damage, although it is somewhat ill-suited to do so. Attack rolls for the
club are made at DM-2.

Heightened Senses  The Ithklur have paired infrared sensory organs
located where the nasal cavities are on humans. These enable them to
detect heat signatures and a broader range of colours. Their olfactory
senses are superior to those of Humaniti. All Ithklur receive DM+1 to
Recon and Survival checks.

Large (+1)  The Ithklur are large and present a huge target. All ranged
attack rolls receive DM+1.

Superior Balance Ithklur have tails that give them superior balance.
All Ithklur receive DM+1 on DEX checks and attempts to grapple with
them with an opposed Melee check incur DM-1.

BACKGROUND SKILLS
At the age of 18, Ithklur must choose their path on the Fourfold Way.
They may choose the Facilitator, Guardian, Explorer or Seeker path.
Their choice may be used to determine a third background skill.

All Ithklur have Melee 0 and Survival 0 as a result of being descended
from arboreal carnivorepouncers. If their EDU score warrants it (6+),
they may choose an additional skill from the following, which indicates
their prospective path on the Fourfold Way
•  Facilitators may choose from Admin 0, Carouse 0, Drive 0, Flyer 0
or Profession 0.
•  Guardians may choose from Athletics 0, Mechanic 0 or Vacc Suit 0.
•  Explorers may choose from Animals 0, Electronics 0, Language 0,
Medic 0 or Science 0.
•  Seekers may choose from Art 0, Streetwise 0 or receive EDU+1.

PRE-CAREER EDUCATION
Ithklur may attempt to attend university or a military academy, although
the former is rare due to their limited EDU scores early in their careers.

RADIALISTS AND HOLISTS
Before choosing a path on the Fourfold Way, Ithklur must determine
which philosophical approach to follow radialism or holism. Radialists
believe that frequently changing paths over the course of their lives is
the best way to reach the state of what they call the 'Blissful Warrior'.
Holists believe that the best way to reach this state is to adhere to a
single path.

Radialists sample at least one career in each path over the course of
their lives. Holists select a single path but many change careers within
that path if desired.

THE FOURFOLD WAY
Whether they be radialists or holists, upon reaching adulthood at the
age of 18, Ithklur must choose a path along the Fourfold Way. Each
path contains multiple career choices. Ithklur with a high enough EDU
score receive three background skills, the last of which is based on
their chosen path. Note that they still must succeed in a qualification
check for that path. Failure to qualify indicates that the Ithklur has not
been deemed a proper fit for the selected path by members of the
Enlightened and must therefore attempt to qualify for another path.

If the Traveller fails to be accepted to all four paths, roll 2D to randomly
determine their path with the following results 1-2 Facilitator, 3-8
Guardian, 9-10 Explorer, 11-12 Seeker.

```
ROGUE ITHKLUR
Whilst the Rogue career is included, the Ithklur rarely engage
in criminal activity. An Ithklur Traveller may take the pirate
assignment if serving as a commerce raider for the Federation.
Likewise, Ithklur enforcers are not participants in organised crime
but might be serving as a bodyguard for important members of
a Hiver nest, a Gurvin corporate officer operating in dangerous
territory or something similar.
```

FACILITATORS
Whilst the Hivers have created a framework for the Ithklur to focus on
what they do best, they still maintain their own societal infrastructure.
Facilitators are the glue that holds Ithklur society together; its citizens
and workers, food providers, educators and shop keepers. Facilitators
also include those who join the Federation navy or the navies of the two
Ithklur polities; giving an Ithklur Traveller the option of joining Citizen,
Navy or Rogue careers. Ithklur may not select the thief assignment.

GUARDIANS
The vast majority of Ithklur are Guardians, the soldiers of the
Federation. Most serve as ground troops on thousands of Federation
worlds but the most visible are the marines, serving aboard Federation
ships. Guardians also include agents; members of police forces and
other investigative or law-enforcement agencies.

Career Options Agent, Army or Marines.

EXPLORER
This path is for those who seek external knowledge obtained from
travelling the universe, meeting with other Ithklur, fellow sophonts of the
Federation or going beyond its borders to encounter other alien species
and to experience unknown worlds.

Career Options Drifter, Merchant or Scout.

SEEKER
The seeker looks for internally accessible knowledge, whether that be
discovering the deeper meaning of 'the ultimate concern' (the closest
thing the Ithklur have to a supreme being) or by engaging in scientific or
artistic discovery.

Career Options Believer (see Traveller Companion, page 36),
Entertainer or Scholar.

QUALIFICATION
Ithklur roll to qualify for a path, not a career. Once on a path, they need
not make subsequent qualification rolls to move between the various
careers in their selected paths. Likewise, radialists do not need to make
subsequent rolls to change paths. They merely select a subsequent
path and are automatically accepted into one of its careers.

There are benefits for those who remain in a single career for multiple
terms. Travellers who remain in a career and advance gain increases to
their RES score, as described below. In addition, each career change
results in a new round of basic training, which awards a skill level 0 in
the respective skill.

GAINING RESOLVE
For each term completed in a given career, the Traveller gains RES
+1 if the Advancement roll was made for that term. Switching between
careers within a path negates the bonus. This reflects that Ithklur who
choose a path and remain in a specific career within that path gain
greater confidence and mastery as a result of their growing experience
in the career. In addition, any changes to SOC are converted to RES.

Remaining in a single career is difficult for Ithklur; the temptation to
experiment with careers or paths beckons them. At the end of their
first term, the Traveller must make an Easy (4+) check to stay in the
same career (in the case of a holist) or the same path (if the Ithklur is
a radialist). Success indicates that the Ithklur maintains their focus and
may stay in the desired career or path. Failure indicates that the desire
for change is too great to resist and the Ithklur must change either
career or path.

After each term in a given career, the desire for change becomes
greater and the check becomes one difficulty level harder. For example,
a holist Ithklur on the Guardian path, serving in the army, must make
an Easy (4+) check after the first term to stay in that career. After two
terms, the check becomes Routine (6+); after three terms, Average (8+)
and so on. Any involuntary interruption and transfer to a new career or
path results in the loss of that term's RES +1.

THE ELEMENTARY, THE ENLIGHTENED AND RANKS
The commission roll is made to determine whether an Elementary Ithklur
becomes Enlightened. The commission roll for each career is RES 9+
and may be made once each term until Enlightenment is achieved.

Elementary Ithklur may roll for advancement as normal but do not
receive official ranks. In Ithklur careers, the Elementary are not
distinguished from one another and are considered interchangeable;
therefore, no distinction is made between individual Elementaries. As
an Elementary advances through the ranks, they receive the listed
Bonus Skills as normal but receive no titles. For example, an Ithklur
may serve in the Army for three terms, failing to make the commission

PATH QUALIFICATION CHECKS

- Facilitator INT 5+
- Guardian STR 5+
- Explorer END 6+
- Seeker INT 6+

roll each term. During those terms, the Ithklur successfully advances
three times, gaining the listed Bonus Skills; however, unlike a human in
the army, the rank 3 Ithklur is merely considered one of the masses of
Elementaries and not awarded the rank title of Lance Sergeant since no
such rank exists.

For careers that have enlisted and officer ranks, when an Ithklur
reaches Enlightenment, they acquire officer rank 1 and may begin
advancing through the hierarchy. For careers that have no enlisted
ranks, the Traveller may still make a commission check since it
indicates whether they have achieved Enlightenment. Prior to
Enlightenment, the Traveller may not acquire ranks or Bonus Skills.

Ranks for the Enlightened do not follow human rank titles and are
based on path, not career.

Ithklur Ranking Titles

SURVIVAL AND ADVANCEMENT
Survival and advancement rolls are made as normal but if any
survival roll requires EDU or SOC they follow the replacement
characteristic listed

Facilitator INT
Guardian STR
Explorer END
Seeker INT

For example, if EDU 7+ is required for advancement in the Army
(support) career this changes to STR 7+ as the Army career is in the
Guardian path.

##### Kar'wyikh of Clan Syoisius

By Christian Urs Wohlthat

The Aslan properly named Loatuakar'wyikh in Trokh, learned early
in his career that humans misunderstand his name to be Lord Ua
Kar'wyikh. He usually does not mind humans thinking of him as a
lord of something but acknowledges that certain humans prefer not
dealing with nobility for cultural reasons he does not fully understand.
So, he follows the advice of his most knowledgeable wife and deals
with human captains and prospectors by the alias of Kar'wyikh. He will
stylise himself as Lord Kar'wyikh however, when dealing with diplomats,
Imperial or corporate agents and Vargr, these groups responding well to
titles of nobility.

Kar'wyikh is an envoy of his clan and falls into the grey area between
spy and negotiator for Clan Syoisius. He is aided by his three wives in
financial and administrative matters, as is prudent for an Aslan male of
his rank and status. However, Kar'wyikh is quite capable of negotiating
on his own behalf, especially when dealing with humans or Vargr
who belong to the lower strata of their societies. He maintains a large
network of loose business associates among the prospectors, tramp
freighter captains and smugglers of the Borderlands.

As is usual for Aslan, Kar'wyikh's personal occupation and that of his
wives are intertwined heavily with clan and corporate politics. While
Kar'wyikh captains the Kteiroa seeker Sisakh'tul, he does not actually
own it. The ship is registered to the Company of Grandmotherly
Kindness, one of his wives being a corporate manager of the company.
Kar'wyikh's wealth comes from two sources what he and his wives
make off prospecting and small trade business, as well as revenue
from his corporation on Arunisiir (The Borderland, Trojan Reach). It is
here that Kar'wyikh holds territory, albeit small; it comprises a city block
in Port Amalgo, the old industrial capital of the planet. Additionally, he
owns a collection of mostly hollowed out asteroids in the field of Trojans
leading Arunisiir's moon.

While the Aslan Loatuakar'wyikh is proud to have gained such territory,
the trader Kar'wyikh understands the precarious situation of Aslan
rule on Arunisiir. Hence, he is willing to trade territory on Arunisiir for
an equivalent on another world, in a duel if need be. Those who can
find him a partner for that deal would surely be named in his personal
collection of epic poetry.

Kar'wyikh even has contacts within
the moderate forces of human
resistance but excluding the neo-
Sindalian hardliners. He tries to use
his economical enterprises to stabilize
Arunisiir – as much for his own sake
as for that of his clan – but works hard
(a rare thing for an Aslan male!) on an
alternative plan, should Aslan rulership
on Arunisiir end. One of his current
business models is selling the heavy
vacc suits his clan manufactures. He
has a small production running in
Port Amalgo and will sell suits
to any customer, sometimes
offering a suit for a reduced
price as incentive for another
deal. All suits bought from
Kar'wyikh will automatically
register on his private
boundary box and comms,
should the wearer be
on the same planet or
within comms range.

```
Clan Syoisius Heavy Vacc Suit Among Aslan, Clan Syoisius
is widely renowned for production of finely ornamented heavy
vacc suits. Clan Syoisius outfits their heavy vacc suits with full
electronic suites, according to the Tech Level of the suit, and adds
claw ports, tail armor, an environmental reader and smart fabrics,
so the customer will never stain their reputation by wearing a
soiled suit. TL12 suits also incorporate self-sealing capabilities.

##### Lord Afle Urelad

Had Lord Urelad been born a couple of centuries earlier, he would
surely have been born to the purple. His long Sindalian bloodline and
great wealth, based on corporate shares and tenant farmers, however,
are betrayed by the fact that Afle Urelad was born to become lord of
Port Amalgo. Alas, Port Amalgo, the ancient capital of Amalgo, cannot
be his seat of power for Amalgo was renamed Arunisiir generations
ago, when conquered by Aslan ihatei. The ihatei swiftly exiled all
traditional nobility from the world and it is thus that Lord Urelad of Port
Amalgo is a noble without land. Hence, his political enemies often mock
him as Lord Lackland.

With his tall figure and long black hair combed back to reveal an east-
Asian heritage, Lord Urelad radiates regality but his actions beguile
no-one to expect clemency from him. Lord Urelad remembers everyone
who calls him names other than those he inherited and is not usually in
a forgiving mood, claiming he will not show clemency before regaining
his ancestral lands and fiefs.

Lord Urelad is not simply a pretender fighting to restore his rule over
the capital of some frontier world in the Borderland. He is also a
close follower and – so he claims – personal representative of the
self-stylised Prince Richter Grehai. Where Prince Grehai speaks of
Humaniti's Aslan cousins and leaves it vague as to their future on
former Sindalian worlds, Lord Urelad is much less subtle. His clear
standpoint is that Aslan are aliens to these worlds and can never rule
them or be citizens of equal rights. Although Lord Urelad is diplomatic
enough to leave open what precisely he has in mind for Aslan currently
living in the Borderland or along the Sindalian Main, he certainly
imagines them severely reduced in number, if not outright gone.

Being an experienced diplomat and administrator, Lord Urelad grasps
this to be a lifetime goal. He hopes time is on his side; the average
human lives longer than an Aslan and although Afle Urelad is still
unmarried and already closing in on his 50th birthday, the anagathics he
started taking 10 years ago have kept him in good shape.

The downside of the drugs, of course, is their cost and although Lord
Urelad has built quite a cache for himself, he has had to divest a painful
number of precious assets to acquire it. Money has never been an
issue to Lord Urelad and he hates the nagging feeling of tightening his
purse strings. He has advanced some of his plans to fruition because
of this and is certain of their success. Planning to cooperate with
pirates of the region, he wants to put pressure on some of the major
Aslan investments around Arunisiir. His hope is that they will bleed their
finances quicker than he does, while hardliner friends of the Grehai and
Bastion movement go into direct action. The only problem is that Grehai

followers need to be convinced of Lord Urelad's legitimacy when he
gives the orders. But surely this can be arranged If needed, external
agents might be helpful...

##### Krungha Processing Ark

By Adrian Tymes

Not all K'kree agree with the Steppelords of the Two Thousand Worlds.
Some believe that survival is best assured by charging forever through
the endless black sky, even if that requires changes from traditional
practices. The Two Thousand Worlds considers these clans to be
exiles, never to be thought of again; the 'exiles' consider the Two
Thousand Worlds to be prey, waiting for G'naak to devour them.

Several of these exiled clans live aboard vast starships, what
some call the very definition of 'World Class Ships'. Although these
ships vary as much as any class of free traders, there are enough
similarities, enough tried and true solutions, to group them into a
single class – the Krungha.

A Krungha is a vast cylinder, two kilometers in diameter and length,
spun to provide 1G on its lowest deck with slowly decreasing gravity
as one approaches the center. The liveable space, comprising the
outer three quarters of the ship's volume, is arranged into 10 concentric
rings running the length of the cylinder with 50 meter separations the
outermost ring 1,000-meter radius, the next ring having a 950-meter
radius and so on down to a 550-meter radius. Each ring consists of
40 meters of open air and 10 meters of structure. There is a varying
thickness, up to a meter, of biosphere obscuring the ceiling, which is
sometimes further obscured by misty clouds. This results in a giant
curved space that fulfils the psychological needs of being 'outside',
even if the horizon curves up instead of down and the residents
intellectually know they are aboard a starship. Like most K'kree
designs, this is space-inefficient compared to most other races a little
over half of a Krungha's 465,000,000-ton volume is open air that serves
little purpose save aesthetics but these aesthetics allow the K'kree to
have a permanent home in space.

How exactly this works has not been explored in depth in any research
shared by the K'kree. Research by non-K'kree is mostly speculation
but the essentials are known. The key is that there is a horizon to each
side, where if a K'kree goes, there will be yet more land beyond the
former horizon, with a new horizon that one can travel to in an endless
cycle. In the other lateral direction of travel, the K'kree can see there
is a wall to either side but the two kilometers between the walls makes
them less confining. K'kree psychologists are certain the same effect
could be achieved with smaller dimensions but have little appetite to
explore precise lower limits.

Portions of the 600- and 550-meter radius decks are set aside for
cargo storage. Passages through this section are somewhat cramped.
It is common to train young K'kree here, letting them feel their genetic
claustrophobia and learn to fight it. This is also the traditional location
where adolescent K'kree are left alone for a while to find their ancestors
so they need never again be alone, a status known as 'kin-to-the-
sky'. This is seen as somewhat holy; that this happens on the cargo
decks leads to religious overtones when residents discuss what sort
of ores their ark shall mine and which goods it shall manufacture, not
to mention where these goods are eventually sold off, usually to the
G'naak whose space they are passing through.

There are six more rings, from 500- to 250-meter radius, which contain
the majority of the ark's systems, primarily the fuel tanks. The passages
here are cramped and meant for robot access. Ramps and elevators
give access from the 550-meter radius deck to the 300, where a
concourse gives access to the innermost ring the docking facility.

The centremost section of a Krungha is a series of horseshoe-
shaped docking slots that can rotate independently of the ark, with a
150-meter-radius circular hole creating a tunnel through the ark and
a section removed to one side ending in a telescopic landing pad.
When a ship wishes to dock or the ark wishes to capture an asteroid,
the incoming object matches velocity (small craft tenders adjust an
asteroids' velocity), enters and drifts through the tunnel until it comes
to an unoccupied docking slot, which extends up to grab the object
and bring it out of the tunnel. The docking slot then starts to spin until
it matches the rotational velocity of the Krungha. Ships wind up above
the concourse, which extends airlock tunnels and supply umbilicals to
mate with the ship. Asteroids end up on the other side of the tunnel, to
be ground up and fed to the mineral refinery. When a ship leaves, the
process is reversed the airlocks and umbilicals detach, the docking
slot is de-spun, the landing pad pushes the ship into the tunnel and
releases it, then the ship moves out through the tunnel.

The asteroid processing facilities are the economic heart of a
Krungha. The ark sails through the black looking for asteroids,
assisted by a fleet of sensor and asteroid wrangling drones. When
a promising rock is found that will fit in the tunnel (cross section no
more than 300 meters across), either wrangler drones will coax the
asteroid in or the Krungha sets course and lets the asteroid float
in until it can be captured, essentially devouring it. Every bit of the
asteroid is used if possible. Even the slag is ground up and used
to shore up failing parts of the Krungha's structure or added to the
radiation shielding. Ore is fed into smelters that transform them into
raw materials. The results are then routed to manufacturing plants to
make a wide variety of goods (including feedstock used to sustain the
ark's biospheres, supplementing recycled biomass to provide food to
the ark's population). A dedicated subunit allows for construction of
starships up to 30,000 tons (or larger if made in sections). On many
Krunghas, these factories have been upgraded to much higher Tech
Levels than the rest of the ark, which is kept to a relatively low Tech
Level for ease of maintenance.

Among the habitable outer decks, large ramps (typically 85–90 meters
long) are the primary means of inter-deck access, with wide elevators
(on nearly any other ships these would be cargo elevators) alongside
them. On the outermost deck, the otherwise-less-usable underside
of these ramps are walled off and used as airlocks, big enough for
entire families to board and leave while staying together. Most of the
rest of the space is marked-off enclosures, open grass and common
facilities with few walls taller than an adult K'kree. This can support
almost 2,600,000 K'kree but is usually measured in terms of families a
Krungha has 216,000 enclosures capable of supporting families of an
average size of 12 K'kree. The enclosures are not uniformly sized, so
as to allocate complete enclosures for larger or smaller families.

A Krungha has a hefty maneuver drive for such a large ship, able
to accelerate laterally and using careful inertial compensation to turn
while under spin when it must. While changing direction of travel is
done readily enough so long as maneuver drive units distributed
around the hull act in a degree of unity approaching that of a jump
drive (this synchronous action is what Krungha engineers refer to
when they speak of 'our herd of maneuver drives'), changing actual
facing must not only keep the massive frame stable but work around
titanic gyroscopic forces, resulting in alterations occurring at 0.003G.
The inertial compensation is also key to a Krungha's continued
integrity, accelerating each part to stay roughly where it should be
relative to the rest of the ark. If a Krungha's maneuver drive suffers
a Severity 6 critical hit or loses all Power (only 4,650,000 is needed to
maintain inertial compensation, subsumed in the maneuver drive's
requirements when under thrust) the ark suffers damage equal to
10% of its initial Hull each round, until this situation is remedied (the
hit is repaired or power is restored; temporary repairs to a critical hit
suspend this for the duration of the repair). Getting artificial gravity for
the inhabited volume to work with inertial compensators is notoriously
unreliable, which is why Krunghas are under spin gravity instead.

Central to the concept is a jump drive. Although only capable of
jumping one parsec at a time, fittings for drop tanks to jump another
parsec are included. While only being able to jump two parsecs
between refuelling keeps it from crossing rifts, this is enough to
get to most parts of Charted Space eventually. A Krungha heading
somewhere has plenty of time. The fuel refinery has dedicated small
craft, which dock at either end next to the docking tunnel, to fetch
unrefined fuel from gas giants, water worlds or the occasional icy
comet encountered while devouring asteroids.

If there is a single point of failure in the design, it is the lone bridge.
Ruling a population of millions somewhat more diverse in thought
than those in the Two Thousand Worlds, the Lord-of-Steppelords who
runs the station needs a symbol of absolute, uncontested control and
the bridge is it. Buried in the 500-meter radius deck, the only access
is through the 'sub-bridge', a field of remote control stations on the
550-meter radius deck arranged in a defensive formation around the
ramp up to the bridge, with more stations positioned to guard the top of
the ramp. The sub-bridge allows control of a portion of the vast array of
small craft a Krungha will deploy to survey asteroids and control space
around it. There are also highly visible meeting areas in the sub-bridge,
for the Lord-of-Steppelords and his immediate subordinates to be seen
in. Perhaps the most well-known use of these areas is that, once every
few days, a group of hundreds or thousands of adolescents come to the
sub-bridge to make ritual obeisance to the Lord-of-Steppelords as their
ultimate master, as a one-time part of their coming-of-age rites.

The systems area contains over one million displacement tons for
expansion according to the crew's needs. The easiest way to gauge a
Krungha's crew's experience and temperament is to see what occupies
most of this space weapons, laboratories, studios or something else.
Only a Krungha less than half a century old will still have this space
mostly empty. Regardless of whether or not there are weapons here,
a Krungha's first line of defence is its many small craft, guided from
the sub-bridge. There are many more small craft than can be directly
controlled from the sub-bridge; ones directly controlled take roles akin
to leaders in a cavalry charge, with uncontrolled robots taking cues
from the controlled craft. Among these small craft are emergency hull
sealers, as a Krungha does not have much internal infrastructure for
sealing breaches.

As of 1105 it is believed there are at least 100 Krunghas, almost all
within Charted Space. Krunghas are not equipped to cross the Lesser
Rift, meaning they cannot flee coreward from the Two Thousand
Worlds. According to reports from the Hive Federation, precisely zero
flee rimward into Hiver space while any that try to exit to trailing soon
fall out of contact and cannot be located. That only leaves spinward,
toward the Third Imperium. Most stay in Gateway, Crucis Margin and
neighboring sectors. Recent raids from the Lords of Thunder (who
sometimes capture Krunghas for their own use) have pushed them in
this region closer to Imperial territory.

A few seek safety by further removing themselves from the Two
Thousand Worlds but most efforts have been unsuccessful.

```
•  Some try to escape coreward. Unable to jump directly to Julian
space, they must cross through the Imperium to Antares before
entering the Vargr Extents. Despite being heavily armed (their
crews knew what they were getting into), all known Krunghas that
took this route were taken down within a year by corsair bands,
save for those that headed coreward-trailing once they reached
the coreward portion of Antares, moving from Imperial space to the
Julian Protectorate.
•  Some try to escape rimward through the Solomani Sphere. The
Solomani generally allow them to pass, sometimes demanding
fees for passage, so long as the Krunghas show no sign of
stopping or allowing families to depart from the arks in Solomani
territory. Most Krunghas that took this route, thinking to get as
far away from the Two Thousand Worlds as possible, eventually
reached the Aslan Hierate where they were hunted and destroyed
on principle. A few found safety in and around the Hadji sector or
migrated rimward from there.
•  The most common route is to cross Imperial space, using the
Vilani Main to reach the coreward-spinward corner of Vland and
from there head to the Spinward Marches. The Third Imperium has
```

```
generally allowed them to pass but does not extend protection of
Imperial law (save for the rare few that declare intent to become
Imperial citizens and stay within Imperial borders), meaning pirate
bands are free to take down and loot any Krungha that tarries. It is
a tradition on Regina, when a Krungha reaches its vicinity, to send
a diplomatic party to congratulate its crew and try to convince them
the Zhodani are G'naak among G'naak, preying on sentient minds
as well as meat, so as to ally the Krungha with Imperial interests
should war break out.
```

Despite the population control effect of failed migrations and occasional
raids from the Two Thousand Worlds (and increasingly from the Lords
of Thunder), the population of Krunghas is estimated to be either slowly
growing or stable as of 1105. If left alone, one Krungha will construct
another at roughly 100-year intervals, when its internal population
nears capacity. This rate would be faster save for the occasional
family permanently taking a newly-built starship to trade with and
survey the local G'naak, becoming friends and allies of any Krunghas
in the area but never re-joining them. The process to make a new
Krungha generally takes 15–20 years, wherein a Krungha will make
its descendant in parts stockpiled in a guarded 'nest' in a system, then
assembles the pieces. To save on construction time, a new Krungha
lacks radiation shielding (the population does not use the outer two
decks at first, letting them act as temporary radiation shielding) and two
thirds of its eventual maneuver drive and power plant, which the new
Krungha will add to itself over its first 20–40 years, depending on how
much manufacturing capacity it devotes to other uses. Once the new
Krungha is ready for initial use, the herd aboard the old Krungha splits
between the two. The resulting herds are related and generally start on
friendly terms but they are forever separate after that.

Occasionally two Krunghas will meet to swap unmarried females
(ensuring genetic diversity), technology and stories. These are
celebrations and festivals like many throughout Charted Space, despite
taking place in deep space. One Krungha may come out of it agreeing
to help the other manufacture its successor, hastening construction
time to 7–10 years. More often, the two will help manufacture each
other's successor, which reduces the manufacturing time to 14–18
years as mass manufacturing efficiencies are realised. Making three or
more at once this way seems unlikely to accelerate construction further
and, more importantly, would require three Krunghas to be in the same
system at the same time and to cooperate long-term.

Like most K'kree ships, the crew of a Krungha is heavily assisted by
robots; most listed crew billings can be fulfilled by robots if needed. The
ratio of K'kree to robots varies from Krungha-to-Krungha but most with
nearly all positions filled by K'kree have a high enough population that they
either are building a new Krungha or plan to start soon. This is in addition
to the efficient centralization of systems a Krungha gets from its size.

##### Krungha K'kree Clans

The K'kree who populate these arks are collectively named for the
arks the Krungha K'kree. Historians generally agree that arks were
named first, then clans shed their former names in favor of 'Krungha'
as a symbolic part of their exile. It is possible that the very first clan to
use these arks (and presumably designed them) was already named
Krungha but relevant documentation appears to have been deliberately
destroyed shortly after the exile began. Subsequent owners are either
small enough clans to be adopted onto an existing Krungha or will
have one constructed for them by existing Krunghas. Either requires
extreme degrees of connections, resources and favors, such that this
only happens when a Steppelord or Lord-of-Steppelords is being exiled,
which even then is rare.

A Krungha K'kree family (whether part of a Krungha ark or split off to find
their own fortune), as well as a lone outsider K'kree whose ancestors
were among these families, can be played as Travellers using the rules
from Aliens of Charted Space Volume 1 with a few revisions
•  With a greater emphasis on utility in a technological civilization,
Krungha K'kree are recognizable for being slightly smaller than
Two Thousand Worlds K'kree and having less pronounced sexual
dimorphism. Krungha K'kree gain STR+3 regardless of gender.
Patriarchs and patriarchs-to-be gain INT+3 and EDU+3; others
have no initial INT or EDU adjustment. When rolling a family's
specialist area, rolls up to 5 are Service and Warrior is only on
a 6. Service-specialized Merchant families may select any other
Merchant specialization for their career. Non-outsider Krungha
K'kree do not automatically spend their first term as warriors,
instead acquiring basic training for K'kree Skills in their first term,
gaining Vacc Suit 0 instead of Patriarchy 0 from this training. They
still acquire no wives in their first term and acquire basic training for
their career skills in their second term.
•  Krungha K'kree are uncomfortable in tight spaces but build up
a tolerance. Instead of using the Claustrophobic trait as written,
Krungha K'kree suffer DM-2 to all checks when in any space less
than four times as tall, wide and long as they are (or any space
less than 32 displacement tons). This becomes DM-4 if the space
is less than twice their size in at least one dimension, such as a
typical stateroom (or any space under four displacement tons).
For any space less than their normal upright size in at least one
dimension, such as a crawlway (or any space less than half
a displacement ton, if they can fit at all), this becomes DM-6.
Convincing illusions can mitigate this but only if the K'kree does
not know it is an illusion moving through a crawlway that looks like
an open field will still have the K'kree touching 'illusionary' walls,

ruining the effect. This only applies to the K'kree's own body a
K'kree can wear virtual-reality goggles to pilot a drone through a
crawlway with no ill effect.
o Krungha K'kree crewing a vehicle they can see out of (most
commonly by using goggles to see via the vehicle's sensors,
so their eyes do not keep reminding them they are in a
vehicle) consider themselves 'one-with-the-vehicle' while
crewing it, so they are only penalised if the vehicle enters
a confined space relative to the vehicle's dimensions or
they lose the ability to see through the vehicle's sensors.
Passengers not involved in any part of the vehicle's operations
do not gain this benefit, putting up with the discomfort for the
duration of the ride. In theory this applies to spaceships too
but Krungha K'kree, like most K'kree, prefer not to use crewed
spaceships tiny enough to induce claustrophobia.
o All adult Krungha K'kree have donned vacc suits often enough
that they need not make a Vacc Suit check to put one on under
ordinary conditions. Children usually have vacc suits put on
them by adults and thus likewise do not make Vacc Suit checks.
•  While the Gregarious trait still technically applies, it is moot for
adults. Krungha K'kree become one-with-the-sky as a coming-
of-age rite. Even if all living K'kree around them are abruptly and
messily slain, such a K'kree is never alone. As far as Imperial
agents have been able to determine, this does not equate
to psionic training, despite suggestive anecdotes. Inventing
procedures to do this safely, retaining one's facilities and ability
to function normally with one's ancestors in one's mind, are
considered among the Krungha's greatest achievements; even
exiles from the Krungha are traditionally allowed to take a copy of
the texts with them. The Two Thousand Worlds prefers not to admit
the existence of these techniques.
•  Krungha arks are commanded by Lords-of-Steppelords. Higher
ranks do not exist, as they would require a large fleet of Krunghas
to travel together for an extended period under one commander. As
of 1105, the Third Imperium has yet to hear of such a fleet existing.
•  Krungha K'kree wives may advise their patriarchs in public, so long
as they are only advising. Krungha K'kree families also tend to be
smaller, as technical capability is more highly prized aboard an
ark, so technically capable servants more often have at least one
wife. One effect is that the D3 additional family members gained
upon acquiring a wife includes the wife. Further, one or more (up
to the number of wives the patriarch has) specialist, worker and
servant family members may be the patriarch's wives (allowing
for the same number of extra hands while reducing the number of
bodies that must be transported, fed and protected), although they

may not be traded for damage in combat. The Krungha see warrior
wives as inherently counterproductive. Then again, the Krungha
have less use for warriors; when they must fight, they sometimes
send remote-piloted drones backed up by robots.
•  Krungha K'kree do not share the Two Thousand Worlds' view
that all G'naak can eventually be converted or slain. They are
more willing to be among and trade with meat-eaters, preferably
at a safe enough distance that they can run if attacked. While
they find preparation and consumption of meat in their presence
to be distasteful and offensive, it is not always cause for
immediate violence, especially without evidence it is being done
to provoke the K'kree.
•  Outsiders are outsiders, even to the exiled clans. Even with
Krungha adaptations, there are still rules to follow to being a true
K'kree. K'kree from the Krungha and the Two Thousand Worlds
treat each other as outsiders should they ever meet, with SOC 0
in each other's area of influence. Krungha K'kree are not treated
as outsiders for purposes of Traveller creation if they are raised
in Krungha K'kree society, despite being outsiders to the Two
Thousand Worlds.
•  Krungha K'kree who leave the ark-herds (willingly or not) do not
gain the Outsider skill as they would not benefit from it being one-
with-the-sky prevents loneliness, they make no Claustrophobia
checks and so on. The same is true of their descendants, so long
as they are raised with the same cultural adaptations (one-with-
the-sky upon adolescence, learning to tolerate cramped spaces
and not immediately attacking meat-eaters).
o A Krungha K'kree family that just left a Krungha will often
(at the Referee's determination) have a Trader of the Outer
Steppe or similar ship able to carry the entire family, in addition
to any other mustering out benefits. Nobles who mustered out
with Ship Shares can spend them on ship upgrades.
o There exist small Krungha K'kree settlements outside the
arks, which rarely last more than a century. Travellers from
these settlements use the same creation rules as those
raised on arks.
•  Officially, the Two Thousand Worlds dismisses the notion that the
Krungha could possibly see themselves as potential prey of the
Two Thousand Worlds, for how could the true K'kree of the Two
Thousand Worlds ever be predators The Krungha do not share
this assurance and sometimes point out that many statements
issued by the Two Thousand Worlds about what all K'kree are like
only apply to the Two Thousand Worlds. For instance, the Krungha
admit with much revulsion the fact that Hivers once managed to
manipulate some K'kree into eating meat on a regular basis and

that this did not make them something other than corrupted K'kree.
On more than one occasion, heresies such as acknowledging that
K'kree sometimes deviate from their natures or that some really
are better off apart from the herd, have caused the Two Thousand
Worlds to send a war fleet to 'correct' the Krungha from which the
objectionable statement came, only for the ark to jump away when
the war fleet reached it, beginning a game of cat-and-mouse with
millions of lives on the line, which the ark only sometimes wins.

##### Misadventures at Blinderby Manor

By Michael Witry

Lord Penford Ffarnham Blinderby – 'Penny' to his old school chums –
is the feudal lord of a peaceful backwater agricultural planet, such as
Ficant (Spinward Marches 1417) or Pichot (Trojan Reach 3015). He
is well-educated but dim-witted and naïve. His family has controlled
the planet since it was originally settled and the family seat, Blinderby
Manor, is a prefabricated house ordered out of a catalogue centuries
ago. It remains the largest building on the planet.

Blinderby returned home from university five years ago and is dreadfully
bored. He is well-off financially but his world's isolation means he has
few opportunities to spend that money. He rushes to the landing field
to greet any starship that arrives and asks Travellers to pop round to
Blinderby Manor for tea. Should they impress Blinderby, he is willing to
offer them a monthly salary to serve as his retainers.

Choose one of the following categories to determine Blinderby's current
desires, then roll or choose from the appropriate table to see how the
Travellers' encounter with him will unfold.

VISITORS WELCOME
Blinderby thinks that the peaceful (albeit a bit drab) vistas of his
homeworld could support a tourist trade. He will need some help for his
destination enhancement program.

```
1D Encounter
1 Years before Blinderby's planet was colonized, the famous
explorer Miryam Fresco went missing in this subsector. Family
legend has it that Fresco crashed on Blinderby's world. A
survey of the planet and a trip to the subsector archives might
help reveal (or fabricate) evidence to support Blinderby's world
as Fresco's final resting place.
2 The villagers and farmers of Blinderby's world are simple,
sturdy folk who are not used to receiving visitors. They will
need to be trained in the genteel art of stewardship.
3 Rolling hills near the landing field would make for an excellent
golf course, if someone could convince a respected course
architect to work on it, and if someone could also do something
about the aggressive-but-ecosystem-critical birds in the area.
4 Blinderby would like help converting the north wing of his
manor into a bed-and-breakfast. After the remodelling, but
before any guests have arrived, he learns that a major travel
network has given Blinderby Manor a one-star review. Who
could be behind this
5 Package tours are reluctant to bring tourists to Class E
starports. Blinderby will need to renovate the landing field into
a real port and impress TAS officials enough to get the port
upgraded to Class D.
6 A mysterious group of businessmen offer to build a towering
casino on Blinderby's world, in exchange for certain legal
concessions. Are they spies, money launderers or just people
with more money than sense
```

THE CALL OF THE STARS
Blinderby would feel a lot less isolated if he had his own starship.

```
1D Encounter
1 Blinderby placed an order for a 50-ton gig from an off-world
shipyard, supposed to be delivered about a year ago. His
protests have met with nothing but excuses. A trip to the
shipyard reveals that the company is beset with legal troubles
and is on the verge of folding. Blinderby's gig might need to be
sold to pay the company's creditors.
2 Blinderby bought a solar sailer. Operating a solar sailer is an
entirely different kind of flying from a standard starship altogether.
The Travellers will either have to recruit an experienced solar
sailer crew–not an easy task – or learn on the job.
3 Blinderby would like a ship he can fly himself. An Aslan ship with
male controls would suit his intellectual capabilities, provided he
can acquire one without revealing that his world would be easy
prey for ihatei.
```

```
4 Blinderby bought a decrepit 3,000-ton freighter with plans to
convert it into a superyacht. Not only will the freighter require
upgrades but the Class E starport will need to be modified to
handle such a large ship.
5 Blinderby bought a racing yacht and is determined to fly it in the
next subsector regatta. Surely it cannot be too difficult to slalom
through an asteroid belt in a ship that can hit 8G acceleration
6 Blinderby has not made a purchase yet. He wants the
Travellers to go with him to a used starship dealer and help him
pick out a ship that is suitable for someone of his importance.
```

WEDDING BELLS
“It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a
good fortune must be in want of a wife.” - Jane Austen, Pride and Prejudice

```
1D Encounter
1 The new Lady Blinderby is a member of a minor human race
that has been engineered for life underwater and she wants
to bring members of her race to Blinderby's planet. Blinderby
Manor and the surrounding countryside will need to be adapted
for their use and the villagers will need to be taught to co-exist
with their new neighbors.
2 Blinderby hopes to win the heart of a Sword Worlder. He will
need help coming up with and executing an unprecedented feat
of derring-do.
3 Blinderby is marrying Vivienne Ffarnham Blinderby, his cousin.
They will need to undergo genetic modification in order to have
children together. The process is mostly safe but occasionally has
bizarre side effects.
4 On his most recent visit to a large city on a nearby planet,
Blinderby fell hopelessly in love with a cabaret singer. To
make her Lady Blinderby, he will need help teaching her the
ways of the nobility and getting her accustomed to life on an
agricultural world.
5 Blinderby's new spouse has four rambunctious children from
a previous marriage. The children terrorise Blinderby's planet
with theft, vandalism, and other petty crimes, and their parent
refuses to discipline them. The villagers want the children to get
what they deserve.
6 Blinderby is courting a woman via mail. She claims to live on
an Amber Zone planet and says she needs money to bribe
the authorities to allow her to leave. Blinderby would prefer to
send the Travellers to rescue her, unaware that he might be the
victim of a con.
```

AFFAIRS OF STATE
When duty calls, a nobleman must answer or pay someone else to
answer for him.

```
1D Encounter
1 The Imperial Interstellar Scout Service wants to establish a
base on Blinderby's planet. He is in favor but the villagers
are worried that the rough-and-tumble scouts will corrupt their
children and convince them to leave home.
2 A visiting ship brought an invasive plant species that is growing
out of control. Blinderby needs help exterminating the invasive
species and establishing a quarantine service to prevent this
from happening again.
3 Blinderby's old school friend, 'Bevvy' Antonov de Champlain,
has arrived on the planet. He has blown up a building on
a nearby planet as part of a delightful jape but the local
authorities have no appreciation for such hijinks and are
offering a dead-or-alive bounty. Blinderby resolves to protect
him by legal means or otherwise.
4 A group of Zhodani traders land and request a detailed tour of
the planet. Blinderby sees no reason not to trust such a well-
mannered group of chaps.
5 Cattle keep going missing in the hinterlands. The locals suspect
each other of rustling and will devolve into a lynch mob unless
the Travellers find the real cause a well-concealed crevice that
cattle have been falling into.
6 Blinderby holds a commission in the subsector naval reserve.
He and all his retainers are summoned to help capture a pirate
fleet by serving as the crew of a Q-ship.
```

AROUND THE SUBSECTOR
Blinderby gets cabin fever now and then, and is keen to visit
neighboring worlds.

```
1D Encounter
1 Blinderby is concerned that he is uninspiring. He visits a world
with a charismatic dictatorship in the hopes of learning their
leadership secrets. The Travellers will need to protect Blinderby
from the suspicions of the secret police.
2 Blinderby's luxury cruise is spoiled by a food-borne illness
that leaves most of the passengers and crew incapacitated.
Blinderby and his retainers will have to help guide the gigantic
ship to the nearest port.
```

```
3 When Blinderby goes on a jungle safari, he will need the
Travellers to keep him comfortable and give help flushing out
the really dangerous game.
4 Blinderby hopes to revive his schoolboy passion for song and
dance by producing and starring in a touring musical revue.
The Travellers can help by directing, recruiting talent, booking
theatres or appearing in supporting roles.
5 Blinderby resolves to cement his legacy by discovering a new
habitable planet and naming it after himself. He will need a
scout ship and a crew.
6 While Blinderby is away, slavers raid his planet and capture
many of the residents. Blinderby plans to track down the
slavers, kill them and bring his people home.
```

ODDS AND ENDS
There is never a dull moment in the service of the idle rich.

```
1D Encounter
1 Blinderby Manor's age is showing. Blinderby wants help
designing and building a new, more impressive house,
furnished in the latest style.
2 Blinderby's younger sister, Lieutenant Hollingbourne 'Holly'
Ffarnham Blinderby, comes home while on leave from the
Imperial Navy. She is charismatic, intelligent and accomplished
```

- everything her brother is not. Blinderby becomes nervous that
the people will force him into exile and proclaim Holly their ruler.
3 Blinderby wants to hold a grand festival for his birthday. He will
need help finding high-class entertainment for his noble visitors
and more proletarian delights for the villagers.
4 Blinderby resolves to stop the planet's brain drain by endowing
an agricultural college. Travellers can help recruit faculty,
construct buildings, find high-tech equipment and manage
town-gown relations.
5 The Universal Sapience Church, a religious organization that
believes all species that can be uplifted should be uplifted,
build a compound on the planet. Blinderby is interested in
joining them but will have to undergo their initiation ceremony
and manage conflict between farm-owning subjects and
uplifted livestock.
6 A scientific expedition reveals that the star Blinderby's planet
orbits will go nova within the next few years. The value of
Blinderby's assets collapse, leaving him without the money to
pay to evacuate his subjects. He will need to get a real job.

#### Charted SpaceCharted Space

##### Stellar Cartography

By Dalton Calford

Maps are produced to aid in navigation, not for geographic
representation. Never trust a map for a purpose it was never designed.
— Every cartographer throughout time.

Space is big, beyond the imagination of the beings who live on the
lowly specs of dust they laughingly call worlds. In order to understand
the scope of space, while being able to use that information in their
day-to-day lives, most sophonts have come up with methods to visually
describe space while not being overwhelmed.

Just as early explorers created what they called 'projections' to be
able to map a round ball unto a flat space, astronauts soon came up
with a method of doing the same with the vastness of the universe.
They began with 3D maps, then expanded upon various forms of route
versus destination maps. As technology changed, maps changed,
leaving many early designs behind.

When an ancient astrographer decided to represent space in a 3D grid,
they once again faced the task of being able to flatten the map onto a
2D surface. Normal 3D projections would have closer objects obscure
farther objects while the distances involved made the illusion of depth
and distance all by meaningless. Facing these large spatial cubes,
with their six possible primary directions, led to an intuitive leap to a
hexagon with its six sides. It was a breakthrough that combined route
and destination mechanics with variable distance projections. This
new mapping technique – the 'Miller' projection, was named after the
ancient human who created it. It soon became the standard.

Early humans relied upon projections of space that were one cubic light
year, as the farthest they could travel at first was but three to seven
light years. This led to maps that were very sparse in content. Once
jump-3 technology was developed, it became obvious to use parsecs
as the base measurement as it corresponded to the distance of the
jump drive. Once again, navigation was the primary focus of maps,
leaving realistic 3D holomaps to become mere artwork forgotten in the
annals of time.

For space voyagers looking upon these maps, each hexagon became
synonymous with the idea of it being a single system.

In truth, there may be nebulas with multiple independent suns, each
with their own planetary systems, all dancing in a majestic gravitational
ballet. But, to the astrocartographer, all that was important in each
hexagon upon their map was the primary world – the mainworld, the
place that had the largest population regardless of the number of
populated worlds found there, was always the one depicted as the
primary focus.

The technology and infrastructure of the mainworld, such as its starport,
was indicated upon the map, as well as if there were economic or
strategic resources such as gas giants or mineral rich planetary belts
present. Even a simple indication about the availability of water on the
mainworld was shown, for those who did not want to pay for fuel.

Later, political information such as governmental bases were added
along with travel advisories.

To the new Traveller, they see little beyond the mainworld but, to an
experienced spacer, the mainworld is but one of the stops in a system
and usually the least interesting. Regardless of experience, it has
become common practice to refer to a cubit parsec as a 'system'
leaving the technicalities of space travel to the astrogators.

##### Interstellar Mapping

Before we begin with detailing what you can find within a system, we will
start with galactic directions, subsectors, quadrants, sectors and domains.

GALACTIC DIRECTIONS
The galactic plane is where the majority of a disk-shaped galaxy's mass
lies. The directions perpendicular to the galactic plane point to the
galactic poles.

North, south, east and west are insufficient terms for referring to
directions within the galaxy. Instead, the following conventions have
achieved widespread acceptance when referring to direction

Coreward  toward the galactic core
Rimward  toward the rim of the galaxy
Spinward  towards the direction the galaxy is rotating
Trailing  opposite the spin of the galaxy
Galactic North  convention based upon galactic spin
Galactic South  opposite direction of galactic north

In terms of spatial topography and interstellar mapping, the Miller
projection makes the terms galactic north and south redundant as they
are directly dealt with via the projection itself. Galactic North is flattened
into the plane in the direction of the core, while galactic south is
transformed into the general direction of the galactic rim.

SUBSECTORS
The smallest and most convenient mapping unit, this is an area
depicting 2,772 cubic light years or, in more reasonable terms, 80
potential systems depicted as a grid eight systems across and 10
systems high. Subsectors in the Third Imperium have their own Duke
who is appointed by the region's Archduke. The Duke represents the
interest of these worlds as well as being nominally in charge of the
subsector defence fleets.

```
3D view of the cubic parsecs in a Subsector
```

Subsector governments deal with the implementation of taxes, the
rights and status of local world governments, corporate interests and
local starport infrastructure. Local authorities historically maintain their
own astrocartographers, resulting in two different coordinate systems
within the Third Imperium.

The local or subsector coordinate only applies within the subsector
itself, leading to a system's location being described by its relative
position in the subsector, that subsector's name, the subsector's
position within the sector, followed by the name of the sector itself. For
example, Regina, the capital of the 'Regina' subsector in position 'C' of
the Spinward Marches sector, can be referred to as

ReginaRegina(C)(0310)Spinward Marches

While the rest of the Imperium just refers to the system as

ReginaRegina (Spinward Marches 1910)

This is slowly becoming the new standard and it may be that, within a
few centuries, the older subsector specific coordinate system will be
lost to history.

The IISS (Imperial Interstellar Scout Service) used to refer to systems
using their own internal designation such as SP-1910C0310-Beta,
which states the system is in the Spinward Marches, hex 1910,
subsector C, hex 0310, Beta Quadrant. However, they now use the
Imperial standard.

To understand how a stellar grouping called a subsector came to be,
one must first understand how movement between systems happens in
real space (3D) as opposed to using the standard projection.

A Traveller in a single cube has
26 possible adjacent cubes
they could move into. Some are
adjacent, others adjacent but
on a diagonal, while others are
offset by two diagonals.

A system, as discussed earlier,
is a cube with six adjacent
sides but those are not the only
directions of travel – you could
be moving on a diagonal but
those diagonals are longer than
a move sideways. Here, you
can see a visualization of all the
possible jump directions

If you think of all the adjacent
cubes as being jump-1 routes,
then all such routes would look
like this and correspond to the six
sides of a regular hexagon. For the
other directions, we need to look at
the extra jump-2 distance caused
by diagonal measurement.

There are 12 such paths from the central cube.

When you have two cubes that are corner to corner to each other, you
are now measuring two diagonals and the distances are in the range
of jump-3.

So, a single cube is represented on the Miller projection as a central
hexagon, surrounded by a ring of hexagons that are its adjacent cubes,
which are in turn surrounded by another two rings of hexagons, which
are represented by the relation to the central cube, not to each other.

When mapping real space to the Miller projection, you are required to
map each hex individually in single hexagon relational movements.
This is because the Miller projection is used for navigation, not for
spatial modelling. All movements are relative to a single hexagon. This
is why, when a non-astrogator is trying to relate real space coordinates
to Miller coordinates, they see huge discrepancies that in reality result
in the same distances travelled. This can also be seen when travelling
on a planet, when you travel in a straight line but on the map you are
travelling in a curve.

If you look at a how a subsector is mapped in real space, you will see
that it in fact looks as shown in the diagram on page 75 – an area of
space, 5 parsecs by 4 parsecs by 4 parsecs, or 80 cubic parsecs.
Compare that to the same area displayed on a Miller projection.

This is the magic of the Miller projection. It allows a complex deep view
of entire stellar systems, their relationships to one another and major
social and economic information on a single flat screen or even an
archaic piece of parchment.

```
Jump-3
```

QUADRANTS
In the Ziru Sirka (the Vilani Imperium or First Imperium by modern
convention) jump-3 technology was never successfully achieved.
Due to this and the fact that the speed of communication was limited
to the speed of travel, they did not adopt a full sector-based level of
government and added an extra layer of management and political
intrigue that further slowed down the implementation of policy.

A quadrant in historical terms is four adjacent subsectors, under the
central control of a senior Duke. This Duke is responsible for dealing
with any political or military difficulties between each of the four Dukes
who control their own individual subsectors.

The Duke in turn aids the Archduke in coordinating tasks and managing
the local elements of sector policy. While there was a time when
local quadrants had their own maps, coordinate systems and level of
bureaucracy, such elements have all but disappeared.

Historically, each quadrant had a designation 'Q' so Q1 represents
subsectors A, B, E and F. When the Rule of Man began, quadrants
were renamed to Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta respectively.
Likewise, Q2 (Beta) represents subsectors C, D, G and H. The layout of
quadrants becomes clear once a sector map is viewed.

From a Traveller's viewpoint, quadrants are a quaint reminder of an
ancient time, until they garner the curiosity of the local noble. In many
cases, it has been the same family in charge of a quadrant since the
settling of the area or founding of the Third Imperium (whichever came
last), although they are no longer an official part of the political structure.

SECTORS
A sector is normally the largest political body that a regular sophont
would ever consider unless they are members of the nobility; four
quadrants, 16 subsectors, 1,280 cubic parsecs or 44,352 cubic light
years. It is a volume of space beyond the comprehension of many and
larger than most sophonts travel in their lifetimes.

Composed of 16 subsectors, defined as A through P and administered
via four quadrants Q1 through Q4, a sector is an immense volume
of space. Home to trillions of beings, it is an economic and
social powerhouse. The ruling Archduke is rarely involved in the
administration of local operations, as it is their duty to manage military
deployments, coordinate economic policies, implement legal policies
and negotiate with delegations from local powers.

Why is Charted Space divided into sectors of 32 by 40 parsecs No
one truly knows, although it seems to date back to the bureaucracy
of the Ziru Sirka and there has never been sufficient momentum or
consensus to change it to something more efficient.

DOMAINS
Domains comprise four sectors, operating as a self-sufficient political
entity with its own Imperial Navy, Marine and Army corps. Only the
Scout Service is not under local regional rule, being managed and
maintained as part of the duties of the Archduke of Sylea.

A domain is normally managed by at least a Duke in the case of
unassumed domains or an Archduke in the case of ratified domains.

The seven domains of the Imperial territories (Sylea, Illeish,
Gateway, Sol, Antares, Vland and Deneb) have been administrative
areas with entrenched hereditary royal households for centuries.
While the Emperor is the Archduke of Sylea in addition to their
power as head of the Imperium, most of the Sylean administrative
duties are pursued by trusted bureaucrats sworn into power with all
the rights and duties that entails.

By the year 1105, the Domain of Deneb had yet to be ratified, with
political power spread between various feuding royal houses. The lack
of an Archduke for Deneb has left the region in disorder and possibly
at risk if the Zhodani wish to take advantage of the situation. Currently
Duke Norris of Regina is considered to be wielding the political capital.

##### Ramona Raskin, Spacer

By Geir Lanesskog

Location Any Vanguard Reaches world with a Class A or B starport
and TL10+
Required Skills Astrogation 1, Engineer (any) 1, Medic 1 and Pilot
(spacecraft) 1
Reward Standard starship crew salaries and an opportunity to apply
Ship Shares to ownership

Mission Prepare and crew a converted laboratory ship for trade
operations

Summary Ramona Raskin has just inherited the converted laboratory
ship Astrogon from her grandfather Sal Raskin, an eccentric trader
and prospector. Sal ran the ship himself with the help of onboard
automation and years of experience. Ramona grew up with her
mother Greta D'Urban, Sal's daughter-in-law, who runs a small freight
transhipment service out of the local highport but they are barely on
speaking terms and Ramona wants to leave the system and seek her
fortune on her newly acquired starship. Unfortunately, she lacks the
skills to operate Astrogon and the ship is 150 years old and rampant
with issues and assorted quirks. Any crewmember would need to sign
on for six months, with the understanding that the first month might be
spent clearing the ship for commercial operations.

The good news is the ship is fully paid off. The bad news is the ship is
completely customised and suffering from old age and a personality
disorder. Maintenance costs are double, repairs are at DM-1, the power
plant has trouble going past 90% capacity and the hull needs serious
work. In theory the ship can (carefully) skim fuel but, in practice, without
fully repairing the hull, the operation would be hazardous at best.
Fortunately, Minnow is equipped with a collapsible fuel tank that nearly
fills its cargo space. Both ship and pinnace have computers running
Intellect and Virtual Crew, meaning both could theoretically operate
basic ship functions without a crew but they each have somewhat
difficult temperaments. While not technically sentient, they act as if
they are. They are not sure about Ramona and certainly are not happy
about any new crewmembers. Buggy's computer permanently runs
Virtual Friend in a manner resistant to modification.

REFEREE'S INFORMATION

1 The ship is technically spaceworthy but requires signoffs from the port
authority to become fully relicensed. Travellers who between them have at
least one skill level in Astrogation, Engineer, Medic and Pilot (spacecraft),
can complete the licensing process with an Average (8+) Admin check (1D
days, SOC) with a DM equal to the highest level in any of these skills. Every
missing skill (of at least 1) applies DM-2 to the relicensing. The ship will be
licensed out of the current port and treated accordingly in other jurisdictions.

Ramona has only Cr25000 saved up. Ship berthing is costing her
Cr1000 per six days and the ship has neither fuel or supplies, requiring
an upfront expenditure of monthly maintenance and life support costs
prior to departure. The Travellers may have to lend her money or make
a profit-sharing arrangement prior to departure.

The personalities of the vehicles will eventually come to accept the
crew, unless efforts are made to eradicate their personalities or the
crew exhibits gross negligence in operations.

2 As above but the ship's hull and power plant do not pass inspection.
This can be finessed with a Very Difficult (12+) check using a relevant
skill, with the Referee applying DMs as appropriate based on the plan
and roleplaying. If not, both items require repair, taking one week each
and costing MCr1.6 (hull) and MCr1.4 (power plant). If this is a new
campaign, Travellers can apply any unspent Ship Shares at MCr1 per
share to cover these costs but must negotiate some sort of ownership
share or other arrangement with Ramona.

These repairs will not actually fully fix the quirks. They will pass
inspection and look better but the 10% hull damage and 10% power
plant deficiency still apply. Each quirk requires another week of work
and the same cost in parts to remove the quirk entirely.

3 As 1–2 above but the vessels' personalities really do not like the
Travellers. A continual passive-aggressive response from Astrogon,
Minnow and Buggy provides DM-2 to any rolls to avoid crew fatigue
and within 2D weeks rumors spread of 'problems' resulting in DM-2
when looking for passengers. One of the tactics employed by Astrogon's
Intellect is to simulate a haunting by Sal's ghost. Fixing these problems
and winning over the machines requires roleplaying or a complete
wipe of the computer systems, effectively rendering the Intellect, Virtual
Crew and Digital Friend software packages unusable. Newly purchased
software is required to restore functionality after a wipe.

4 As 1–2 above but Ramona's mother, Greta D'Urban, is unhappy with
the new situation and tries to sabotage her daughter. Skill checks within
the initial star system, including those for completing the licensing process,
procuring freight, speculative cargo, passengers or mail all suffer DM-2.
Within six parsecs of the initial system, these checks suffer DM-1.

5–6 The issues in 1–4 apply. If the Travellers attempt to leave the
Astrogon prior to their six-month agreement, Ramona will use the
enticement of ownership shares to convince them to stay on, assuming
they have behaved reasonably towards her.

NOTES
This patron can be used to start a trade or travel-focused campaign
with an unusual spacecraft. Ship Shares can be used to address the
hull and power plant issues but the maintenance cost for the vehicle
will always be doubled, as it requires specialized parts to operate.
Any attempt to steal the vehicle from Ramona or cause her harm will
result in a strong response from the Intellects and her mother, who
now suddenly takes an interest the issues noted in #3 and #4 above
will certainly occur (or reoccur) and Greta D'Urban will put a bounty
of Cr250000 on the Travellers, payable for recovery of the ship and
incarceration of any survivors.

Ramona Raskin is a slight young woman with an enthusiasm
for exploring the universe, which she hides behind a demeanour
of cynicism and sarcasm. Her inheritance came as a complete
surprise, as she had not seen her grandfather in two years and
did not know his ship was in port when he died from anagathics
withdrawal. Her father disappeared on a merchant ship that
'misjumped' seven years ago.

Born and raised on the highport since her father's
disappearance, Ramona has worked with her mother at D'Urban
Freight Transhippers. She understands the business of freight
brokering and has a license to operate the company's aging
cutter. Other than a trip to a neighboring system aboard
Astrogon with her grandfather during his last visit, she has never
left her star system.

She and her mother share an acrimonious relationship that has
recently gotten worse. Ramona's earlier attempt to sign on with
a free trader was sabotaged by her mother and they are barely
on speaking terms. She sees Astrogon as an opportunity to
gain freedom and travel among the stars. On a ship without a
mortgage, she thinks she can earn enough to get by but knows
she needs a crew, at least for the first few years until she can
get enough experience to work the ship by herself or with robot
helpers. Unlike her grandfather, she is more interested in the
'softer' sciences of archaeology, sophontology and cultural
studies, with her interest in planetology limited to how physical
features support life and habitability.

Despite her youth and
inexperience, Ramona is not
stupid or foolish, so will listen
to advice from more seasoned
Travellers if they do not treat
her in a demeaning manner.
Astrogon is her ship; she is
captain and master, so expects
to be treated as such. If she is
unhappy with her crew, she will
work with the ships' Intellects to
make her displeasure known.

ASTROGON LABORATORY TRADER
The laboratory ship now known as Astrogon was originally launched
from a Ling Standard Products yard at Glisten in the Spinward Marches
in 953. It enjoyed a full career working in planetology research for
several universities, until sold as obsolete in 1013 at Corella in The
Beyond. The buyer was a small trading cooperative who converted the
ship into a freighter capable of hauling 100 tons in its gutted laboratory
space. After more than two decades of operation within the Corellan
League, the cooperative broke up and sold the ship for scrap.

In 1034, Sal Raskin, former science officer from the moribund
Triumvirate Exploration Bureau, bought Astrogon at auction on
Kajaani for MCr5 and restored the vessel as he wandered across
the Vanguard Reaches and The Beyond, conducting speculative
trading and prospecting, with some contract exploration missions on
the side. For decades he earned enough to keep the ship running,
although his personality tended to alienate his crews and eventually
drove his daughter-in-law to leave both ship and father-in-law and,
soon thereafter, her husband. Sal's son Robert left shortly afterwards
and since 1085, Sal operated the ship alone, almost never taking
passengers but running cargos and prospecting the minimum
amount of asteroids required to keep the ship running. Eventually his
expensive, imported anagathics from the Third Imperium ran out on him
and the withdrawal killed the 108-year-old man.

Astrogon is a quirky ship. Its ship's brain has been running continuously
since 967 and while not truly sentient, it emulates it well enough.
Through its own avatar, drone and swarm controllers or using the
installed computer's Virtual Crew software, Astrogon can pilot the ship,
operate sensors and communicators, fire weapons and operate the
ship's recon probe drones. As a non-sentient being, its independent
Astrogation skill checks suffer DM-4 and attempts to use its recon
probe drones to perform maintenance or repair tasks also suffer DM-4.
The brain's piloting and electronics operation skills operate at skill level
2 but they override rather than supplement manual operation, so the
brain's priorities may not align with the Travellers'. The ship's brain can
be disconnected or shut down with a Very Difficult (12+) Electronics
(computers) check (1D hours, INT) but the ship will actively oppose this
task unless entirely powered down and prevented from communicating
or controlling the ship's recon probes – a feat the ship's brain can
manage for 27 days on backup power. Permanently disconnecting the
ship's brain renders the ship's primary computer inoperable, forcing the
crew to rely on the backup computer10.

While the entire laboratory space was ripped out to provide cargo
capacity, Sal Raskin retrofitted a laboratory, library, medical bay
and workshop into part of the living area, reducing the number of
staterooms. Sal and Astrogon both retained an interest in planetology
from their former 'careers' and the laboratory is configured for

planetology and mineralogical studies, providing a DM to relevant tasks
for scientists and prospectors. The laser drill and missile rack mounted
on the hull are ostensibly for mining and probe launches but can work
as weapon platforms in a pinch. The hidden pop-up laser turret is there
to discourage pirates and defend against missiles.

Much of the interior is indifferently furnished but ship systems are
generally well-maintained. The autodoc in the medical laboratory, as
well as the one on the Minnow, are imported from the Third Imperium
and can revive mortally wounded patients, within reason. The autodocs
have their own personality quirks and are upset by Sal's death but even
they could not halt time.

The ship bears the signs of the former owner's hoarding tendencies.
One stateroom is overflowing with random 'stuff', the library is brimming
with books, data crystals and odd objects collected from a dozen
worlds. The laboratory has sample boxes scattered and stacked,
and the medical lab has several unlabelled boxes of vials, some of
which may be medicinal. Other objects may be recovered in the 'seat
cushions' of the bridge, pinnace or airraft. Random objects include data
crystals holding promising mineralogical surveys from three asteroid
belts and two rockballs, locations of four rogue gas giants and detailed
system surveys of the interdicted systems of Huad Yai, Yrfrzhielia and
Bauxia. Other randomly located items include a psionic shield helmet,
PRIS binoculars, a portable computer running Decrypter3 (TL14) and,
tragically, far from the medical laboratory, a single vial of anagathics.

The ship holds a jump net capable of doubling capacity for a single
parsec jump, allowing hauling of up to 400 tons of additional cargo, or
fuel tanks to extend the ship's range, theoretically allowing a transit of
up to six or seven parsecs on fumes and frayed nerves. The advanced
probe drones are non-standard. There are actually only 14, as the
one named Lorn was lost in a volcano. Four of the probes have no
manipulators but are equipped with missile drive units (allowing up to
10 G-hours at up to 10G) and long-range communicators to let them
to be used as relay satellites. The probes all have names but are not
particularly intelligent, although of the 10 standard advanced probe
drones, up to five at a time can be operated by the Intellect and Virtual
Crew of Astrogon or Minnow for simple tasks such as cargo handling.

Solar panels allow Astrogon to stay on station near indefinitely
without refuelling, which is useful for both prospecting and planetary
expeditions. Sal equipped the ship to perform wilderness refuelling but
it requires careful piloting to bring a laboratory ship into an atmosphere
and landing on a solid surface is dangerous, although the ship will float
on water if the pinnace is detached and the cargo holds are no more
than half full. Flying the ship in an atmosphere before the hull is fully
repaired will result in DM-2 to Pilot checks in addition to DMs for being
only partially streamlined. Attempting a landing requires the pinnace to
be detached and setting down with ring flat or parallel to the ground,

resting on the drive pods. This will always require an additional DM-2
for Pilot checks and attempts will result in a strongly worded protest
from the ship's Intellect.

Quirks applying to the Astrogon are
•  Upgraded sensors
•  Upgraded computer
•  Smuggling compartments
•  Extra weaponry
•  Unusual library data
•  Damaged hull (-10%)
•  Unreliable power plant (90%)
•  Double maintenance cost
•  DM-1 to all repair attempts

The latter two quirks cannot be resolved. They are now inherent in
the ship's design, although 10 years of service aboard the Astrogon
will remove the repair DM for that individual. The hull and power plant
can be repaired as explained in the Ramona Raskin patron encounter.
The power plant could temporarily operate at a full Power 180 but this
requires the Overload Plant action (see Traveller Core Rulebook, page
171). The normal remedies are to dim the lights for jump and perform
most maneuvers at Thrust 1.

MINNOW SLOW PINNACE
The Minnow has a personality all of its own. The ship is accustomed
to autonomous operations, such as gas giant skimming and starport
landing operations, including loading and unloading cargo with
the help of up to eight drones. With a ship's brain operating at
effective skill level 0, it approaches all tasks with caution, decreasing
difficulty at the expense of time. In general, this attitude dominates
its personality and it will express nervousness when any tasks
performed by a biological crew are hazardous or rushed. The ship
can fire the forward mounted pulse laser autonomously but prefers
to flee from any fight, although it will obey orders to fight from
Astrogon's recognized owner and defend the starship and crew if
either are threatened. Solar panels allow for near infinite endurance
if not manoeuvring and, combined with two emergency low berths
and a high-tech autodoc, it can act as a long-term lifeboat for up to
nine individuals. Between bridge seating, acceleration benches and
extra cabin space, Minnow can accommodate up to 10 conscious
individuals. The cargo compartment can hold up to 20 tons of fuel
with the collapsible tank inflated. Custom fuel transfer couplings allow
transfer of fuel to Astrogon via the docking ring.

BUGGY SEALED EXCURSION AIRRAFT

Buggy is a pressurised airraft capable of supporting five people for
as long as four days in both vacuum and hostile conditions. The air
raft can reach orbital space within one to two hours and operate
independently with its autopilot engaged, although it lacks any more
intelligence than a drone. Its computer runs a locked copy of Digital
Friend, with a personality that is chatty and overly polite. All seats but
the driver's are removable, allowing storage of up to 2.5 tons of cargo
(1,250 kg or 5 Spaces of equipment). Buggy's computer and robot brain
are tightly integrated. The robot brain includes external PRIS imagers
and controls both Autopilot and Navigation equipment, rendering these
features inoperable if Buggy's brain is disabled or bypassed.

#### Charted SpaceCharted Space

##### The Spacer's Union

By Michael Bailey

Although officially known as the Solomani Federation of Starship
Crew and Worker Unions (SFSCWU), this organization is usually
referred to as The Spacer's Union (or simply The Union) throughout
the Solomani Confederation.

Not all starship crews in the Solomani Confederation are union
members and members need not be active crew, although
membership will usually be suspended or cancelled if payment of
dues stops. Membership is encouraged by some local governments
and corporations, passively or actively discouraged by others, and
implacably opposed by a few.

The union supports and is (usually) supported by the Solomani Party,
although it naturally has a more adversarial relationship with people
and entities whose interests are threatened by their support for
starship crew rights, benefits and working conditions. The union has a
surprisingly warm relationship with Free Traders; after all, many traders
were crew themselves once.

HISTORY
Although associations and unions of starship crew are common
throughout Solomani history, the origins of the SFSCWU are generally
held to have started with efforts to organise starship labour in the
Solomani Rim. This was done in the face of the increasingly pro-
megacorp policies favored by Emperor Zhakirov. The union was
resisted by the megacorps, as well as the larger sector-wide corporations
operating in the Rim, resulting in the unions' increased support of the
nascent Solomani separatist movement in the 8th and 9th centuries.

Several unions signed the Solomani Charter in 871 and became
increasingly organised and influential as the Solomani Movement
gathered pace in the rimward parts of the Imperium. With the creation
of the Solomani Autonomous Region, the various labour unions
organised themselves into the Council of Starship Workers Associations
in 866, with the tacit approval of the Solomani Party. The Council was
an active supporter of the Solomani Confederation both preceding and
throughout the Rim War, following which it reorganised and renamed
itself to the SFSCWU in 1023.

In recent years support for the Confederation and Party remains strong,
despite the fact it is an umbrella organization, meaning the power it
holds can be somewhat limited. In the Solomani Rim, this support
manifests largely as support for the Federalist and Co-existence
factions of the party.

ORGANISATION
Much like the Solomani Confederation itself, the Spacer's Union is an
amalgamation of regional and functional groups sharing similar goals.
Union policy is set by the Federation Standing Committee, elected by
member unions for five-year terms. The Standing Committee is also the
official mouthpiece of the union and first point of official contact with the
Confederation government.

Below the Standing Committee, the union maintains official offices on
high population worlds with Class A and B starports for the purposes
of lobbying, liaison with member groups and promoting the union. The
member organizations themselves carry out the bulk of the union's work
and own most union assets.

As of 1107, the union counts over 100 member organizations, some of
the largest andor noteworthy include the following

```
•  Sternensegler Gewerkschaft (SGS) Headquartered on Saxe,
the SGS represents members in the Near Boötes Cluster and
surrounding systems. The SGS is a wealthy and influential
organization in the Cluster and has a cosy relationship with Saxe
Transport (a point of some contention among its membership).
Attempts to establish a presence in the Kukulkan subsector have
been met with resistance by Crown Lines, which is wholly opposed
to any unionization of its workforce.
•  Spacer's Union Jardin Chapter (SUJ) The union is not strong
in the Jardin subsector, where it is often the target of criticism
and suppression from the local governments aligned with Jardin.
Opposition is particularly harsh on Jardin itself, where membership is
illegal, and many officials remain imprisoned.
•  CrewAssistMutual Services (CAMS) CrewAssistMutual
Services provides many functions that in the Imperium are
marketed by the Travellers' Aid Society. CAMS is a commercial
arm of the union and provides employment, legal, accommodation
and financial services to both members and customers in the
Solomani Rim and Alpha Crucis. It operates hotels, bars, clubs,
banks, apartments and many other enterprises, and is likely to
be the most visible face of the union to Travellers. CAMS also
provides security for many member organizations and is rumored
to provide quasi and extra-legal services for members dealing with
official and unofficial difficulties.
•  TransStar Employees Association (TEA) A group exclusively
catering to past and present employees of TransStar. Despite its
conservative reputation, the TEA also functions as an unofficial
channel for the Solomani Party and SolSec to influence and
interact with the union. Many members are also SolSec monitors
(both outwardly and covert).
•  Stella Aetheres ('Star of the Skies') Provides services
to members throughout Alpha Crucis, particularly on Turin
Consolidation member worlds. Stella Aetheres is operated by the
Church of the True Cross.
```

FUNCTIONS
The Spacer's Union is a diverse organization with many roles.
Although primarily a vehicle for protecting the rights and privileges of
starship crews in the Solomani Confederation, the union also provides
advocacy, legal assistance, employment assistance and financial
services for members. Most of these functions are performed by the
various member organizations under broad policy direction from the
union hierarchy.

##### Encountering the Union

Travellers in the Solomani Rim are highly likely to encounter union
officials as patrons, contacts or adversaries. Travellers crewing
starships may also be union members themselves and can engage
union services to assist them in their endeavors. Union dues vary but
are typically between one and two percent of the member's salary.

SAMPLE ENCOUNTERS
•  The Travellers are contacted by CAMS for assistance in rescuing
an important official who has been detained on highly dubious
charges by a hostile local government. Official protests and
requests have been met with blank refusal to deal with the union,
so other measures are required. The official may have been
attempting to organise on a world where the union is outlawed, run
afoul of a hostile corporation or simply been in the wrong place at
the wrong time.
•  A union official is concerned that the SGS' relationship with
Crown Lines has compromised the interests of its members. The
Travellers are asked to investigate an SGS office in the Near
Boötes Cluster and dig up any evidence of corruption or bad faith
dealings (which may or may not actually exist).
•  Union staff and members at a local 'Crewman's Rest' may be a
valuable source of rumors and other information relevant to the
Traveller's current adventure.
•  The union is attempting to quietly rebuild its influence in Imperial-
held parts of the Solomani Rim. Sharurshid representatives have
asked the Travellers to investigate attempts by employees in its
bulk transport division to organise and demand better wages and
conditions. Put a stop to these activities, if possible, but nothing
should be traceable to Sharurshid.
•  While investigating the above, the Travellers discover that the
attempts to organise are a front for building a network of informants
inside Sharurshid by andor for SolSec. Suddenly the tables are
turned and the Travellers must get this information to the authorities
before SolSec can neutralise them.

Location Uthevagogha Down Starport, Thoznaen, The Beyond

Reward Cr50000

Mission Break into a defence systems manufacturer's computers to
determine shipping information

Summary Urazargl Gnoezdanu, 'call me Uraz', is an emissary for the
Defenders of Peace, a Thoznaen-based non-governmental organization
dedicated to the establishment and preservation of peace on Thoznaen.
Supported, in part, by the neutral nation of Uthevagogha, the Defenders
of Peace are trying to avoid a war between the nations of Oksiz and
Kozvurrouk. Oksiz is a militaristic state with suspected ties to corsair
bands, while the larger nation of Kozvurrouk is a republic wrought with
internal divisions that Oksiz has been exploiting.

Oksiz has secured an order for a shipment of Urrazdhuez grav sleds
from Ongozzaen Arms, a local manufacturer of military vehicles.
While Oksiz does not use Urrazdhuez grav sleds in its own military,
the Kozvurrouk paramilitary militia does and Uraz believes Oksiz's
intelligence agency intends to use the vehicles in a false flag operation
either to incite an incident to trigger war or foment turmoil between the
Kozvurrouk paramilitaries and their main army.

Uraz wants the Travellers to break into Ongozzaen Arms' headquarters
in Uthevagogha City, access their protected manufacturing and
shipping databases, and provide the information to Defenders of
Peace who will then publish the data and try to prevent the sale from
taking place. Ongozzaen Arms uses Imperial databases and computer
technology in its local systems to hinder hacking attacks by local actors.
Uraz assures the Travellers that he can keep their participation secret,
assuming they remain undetected in their efforts.

The headquarters is in a 50-storey office tower in Uthevagogha City
with shared tenancy. Ongozzaen Arms occupies the top 10 floors,
with a data center located on floor 47, although access to the required
information should be available from any terminal within the office
space. Electromagnetic shielding prevents remote access to any of the
secure terminals.

Referee's Information
1 All is as stated. Ongozzaen Arms relies on electronic building
security and surveillance. Access to the lobby is unrestricted but to
use the elevators, a visitor must be escorted or pass through a TL12
biometric scan. Spoofing the elevator system scan requires direct
access to the panel and a successful Very Difficult (12+) Electronics
(computers) check (1D rounds, INT). Success will generate a false
positive match. The scanner is optimized to recognize Vargr, granting
DM+2 to attempts for non-Vargr to pass. The elevator security system
could be remotely accessed by a hacker but the attempt becomes
Formidable (14+). Any failure will trigger an alert to law enforcement,
although remote hacks take time to trace their origin.

Physical access to the building from the roof or a sub-basement-
connected maintenance tunnel is possible but access to the elevators or
maintenance stairwell requires a similar biometric scan from a separate
system maintained by an outside contractor. This system requires a Very
Difficult (12+) check to access, whether on-site or remote.

Once inside the secure area, Ongozzaen only relies on remote
monitoring during off-hours, requiring a Difficult (10+) Stealth check
(1D minutes, INT or DEX) to avoid. Tripping an alarm will bring a team
of two to four security guards armed with TL12 stunners and armored
with protec suits over a layer of TL12 cloth (Protection +8) from the
lobby security office. They will immediately summon law enforcement if
they encounter or anticipate lethal resistance.

The office computer terminals are not well secured. Any biometric
identity bypass that allowed entry into the elevators will also allow a
Traveller to log on to the terminals. Extracting the proper information
requires privileges either already available to the identified user (if the
Travellers appropriate the credentials of any manufacturing or shipping
department employ or any director-level manager, although all of
these employees are Vargr) or by privilege escalation, a Difficult (10+)
Electronics (computers) check (1D minutes, INT).

Once the information is extracted and provided to Uraz, the Defenders
of Peace will publish the information to thwart the sale or at the very
least compromise any false flag operation. Uraz will be able to keep the
Traveller's identity secret.

2 As 1 but the internal system has a known bug, making privilege
escalation an Average (8+) check. However, the building guards are
equipped with Infiniti Arms Model XII Stazers and will use lethal force
if attacked.

3–4 As 1 but Uraz is an agent of the Kozvurrouk Secret Service. He
will use the information to seize the shipment as it is being delivered,
triggering an armed confrontation with Oksiz agents, although not a
war. If the Oksiz government discovers the Traveller's involvement,
they will be considered enemies of the state and hunted by an Oksiz hit
team if they remain on Thoznaen or return within three years.

5–6 As 2 but Uraz is an agent of the Oghuezvaz corsair band. He will
use the information to hijack the shipment prior to its delivery, leaving
evidence to frame the Travellers. The Oksiz government will assume
the Travellers' guilt and name them enemies of the state, assigning
a hit team authorized to travel up to four parsecs from Thoznaen
in pursuit of the Travellers, remaining active until recalled. This will
occur after 1Dx6 months or in the event of a regime change in Oksiz,
whichever comes first.

In all cases Uraz will pay the Travellers for the data.

Urazargl Gnoezdanu (Ooh-raz Gnohz-dan-oo) is a middle-
aged Vargr with white streaks in his otherwise black fur. He
maintains a dignified air in his speech but tends to use his
hands to emphasise points. He is well-dressed to the point of
flamboyance and has a typical Vargr love of bright colours,
favoring shades of green, yellow and pink, often in paisley
or floral patterns. Uraz walks with a distinct limp, rendering
him unable to run for any distance, for which he blames an
unspecified 'boating accident' in his youth. One ear is clearly
scarred, which he blames on the same incident, but any student
of Vargr fighting styles is more likely to believe it was partially
bitten off and inexpertly repaired.

Uraz has been an emissary for various organizations throughout
his entire adult life and is comfortable working with Vargr, human
and Aslan counterparts. A native of war-torn Thoznaen, Uraz has
used methods, both legal and otherwise, to advance his clients'
interests through non-violent means. Moral views of honesty and
legality are somewhat adaptable in support of his clients' goals.

His diplomatic techniques rely on making counterparts feel
important and convincing them his goals are their ideas. While
not opposed to working for organizations employing violence
to achieve their goals, Uraz considers himself a pacifist. He
is never armed and refuses to wear armor – not even a
concealed diplo vest – believing his persuasiveness is the only
protection he needs. He considers any outcome deteriorating
into violence as failure and is determined to reach a peaceful
resolution even if it occurs through intimidation, although his
threats will always be indirect.

Uraz loves to be the center of attention but strives to bring either
his clients or his counterparts into the spotlight with him. At social
gatherings he is always working the crowd; introducing people to
each other, praising their accomplishments, although often this is
done in a self-serving manner, their accomplishments credited,
at least partially, to himself. He is, however, very discrete about
former clients and their goals. If asked for references, he can
provide a carefully curated verifiable resume of former clients but
it has notable gaps, some spanning multiple years.

##### Infiniti Arms Energy Weapons

By Geir Lanesskog

Infiniti Arms is a manufacturer of personal energy weapons, mostly
stunner and laser small arms. The corporation is based in Stormhaven
but ownership is obscured by holding companies and trusts, although
any competent forensic accountant can determine the corporation is
majority-owned by the General Development Corporation (GeDeCo).

Infiniti Arms products are sold to individuals, governments and organizations
throughout the non-Aslan territories of The Beyond, with major facilities
located on Bushido, Nakris and Excalibur. A facility on Thoznaen specialises
in manufacturing models designed for the Vargr market.

Infiniti Arms products are known for their high quality, sophisticated
electronics and integral rechargeable power packs. The bestselling
products are the Model IV and Model VII stunners but the company is
most known for its Model XII stazers – combined stun and laser weapons
with an overunder aperture system sharing internal components.

The Model XII is capable of selective fire stun, laser (single shot), laser
(burst), blast (high-powered laser). Although considerably more expensive,
the compact Model XII is a preferred weapon for elite security forces
throughout The Beyond, allowing them to tailor their response with a single
weapon. The power pack is a detachable one kilogram cell, allowing for
reloading and separate charging.

The Model XII shares the casing and many of the internal components
of the Model VII stunner. This has led to the rumored manufacturing
of a Model XIII Stazer, externally identical to a Model VII stunner but
equipped with a reinforced dual-purpose aperture allowing it to function
like a Model XII. The major limitation of this purportedly highly illegal
weapon is that to utilise a Model VII power cell, it has only limited
capacity and risks overheating if fired in blast mode.

##### Harlari

(Araneae Erethizontidae)
By Isabella Treccani-Chinelli

Found on Vald (C9D6400-B) in Alpha Crucis, harlari are small nocturnal
creatures that inhabit the large trees found in the mountainous regions
of the planet. Due to its inability to fly it has evolved to be a trapper,
subsisting mainly off of grubs and other insects that larger airborne
creatures tend to ignore.

Measuring roughly 11–16 centimeters in length, with mottled brown skin
and quills, it has few natural predators among the airborne creatures
inhabiting the skies above. With a miniscule average weight of 0.4 kg it
is able to maneuver with great skill, mostly due to its eight legs. These
allow it to gain traction within the trees it calls home, skittering around
at a surprising speed.

Thanks to their nocturnal activity the harlari developed a form of infra-
red vision that allows them to see up to 20 meters. They have vision
enough to protect their nests against threats from above, as often they
will be found in only small family groups consisting of a female and
her two or three young with only the adult females' quills as effective
defence. Making their nests in the larger boughs of the trees they are
almost impossible to spot from above at night, although would be visi-
ble from underneath in the daytime due to the size of the nest.

With a back coated in quills of roughly three centimeters in length, the
harlari makes a fierce companion for any Traveller, should they be able
to befriend one. The quill tips are coated in poison, perhaps an evolu-
tionary result of the near extinction of the species. With barbed ends,
they can easily become lodged within the skin or armor of someone
attempting to capture or kill it. When threatened by something of signifi-
cantly larger size, the harlari will either 'shoot' the quills at the offender
or attempt to hide itself by blending in with the bough it is on.

The species has two genders and reproduces by the male 'fusing' to the
side of the female. The two then share blood circulation, with the male
receiving nutrients from the female in return for impregnation. After the
two have fused, the male quickly decomposes and the task of laying the
eggs and raising the young falls to the mother. It is not unheard of for the
mother to eat her young and have to restart the process.

A typical gestation period lasts 10–15 standard days, with the babies
being almost fully formed on birth, their quills coming into form after six
months. Due to the absence of the male, the female provides her young
with food during this period of development, teaching them how to trap
food within smaller branches and the webs woven in-between. With an
average lifespan of 5–10 years, the adult female is able to lay multiple
clutches of eggs, having reached maturity after six months.

##### Iderati Space Defence System

By Konstantin G

An assailant not deterred by the prospect of naval combat just might
be by an invisible unrelenting threat that will inflict bitter losses from
radiation poisoning and require the destruction of the very prize they
desire – an unspoiled garden world. At least that is what designers of
the Iderati space defence system were hoping for.

The industrial capacity of Iderati is limited, so construction of deep
core meson weapon emplacements was not a possibility, but the
ocean of the planet is vast and deep. It was decided to replace
a meson emplacement with multiple mobile systems based on a
submarine platform.

Existence of this part of the space defence system, while not
advertised, is made known. Hopefully, if the 208th fleet is ever recalled,
this will deter any potential attackers.

IDERATI SPACE DEFENCE SUBMARINE
This compact, 50x7x12 meter, deep dive submarine is the
cornerstone of the Iderati space defence system. For a rich,
environmentally conscious – some would say obsessed – planet
covered by uninterrupted and deep oceans, it was easier to deploy
networks of these submarines than hollow out a cavern deep in the
crust to deploy meson batteries. Practically undetectable, these
submarines can pummel any invading fleet on either side of the planet
with relative impunity.

The bays have limited aiming capabilities, so are angled upwards in
relation and pointed in the required direction by the submarine itself. For
this reason, the bridge and battle stations are outfitted with gravity plates.

For close defence the submarine has two torpedo batteries on pop-up
hardpoints, capable of launching four torpedoes at a time each, as well
as an anti-torpedo system based on gauss technology with specialized
projectiles optimized for underwater use.

The underwater sensor suite is able to reliably detect stealth
submersibles at up to 2,500 kilometers and often used to gather
scientific data for the onboard laboratory. Above water sensors are
supported by drones, capable of relaying data from the surface to the
submarine hidden deep below, while relay options include optical cord

or sonic commlink. The sensors themselves can detect targets up to
5,000 kilometers away, although the meson bays still need input from
external sources to track targets on the opposite side of the world.

During wartime the submarine can stay in the deep for up to 400 days,
although crew rotations are usually done every three months. In order
to make life bearable in this confined space, amenities include a library
and training room, capable of supporting martial training. The library
has a practically unlimited supply of training software for the crew to
pass the time in a productive manner and for those who prefer light
entertainment, there is a large common area with holographic theatre
and multiple holographic game tables.

The captain and the first officer have personal quarters, other officers
share staterooms, while lower decks crew have to make do with
bunks, although each bunk is fitted with a sphere of solace to provide a
modicum of privacy.

There is an internal bay that supports one miniature submarine to fulfil
both logistical and close defence roles. In times of low alert level, these
mini-subs are often used for scientific study of the oceans, with most of
the crew eager to participate.

Service on these defence submarines is difficult but prestigious among
the Iderati military, with tours often leading to fast promotion. Career
officers seek positions on these submarines to study for their senior
staff college exams.

IDERATI LIGHT SUPPORT SUBMARINE
This boxy little deep sea submarine is designed to occupy as little
hangar space as possible, usually serving as a support craft on other
vessels. With tight dimensions, it can be stacked efficiently.

The craft uses fusion powered water jets for propulsion, achieving
a respectable speed of 200 kilometers per hour in dense fluid. Only
lightly armored and armed with torpedoes, with a gauss cannon for
above surface offensive capabilities, the craft is also protected with a
gauss-based anti-missile system and decoy dispenser; the craft is not
intended for heavy combat.

While not specifically designed for prolonged operation it can,
nonetheless, support crew and passengers for a few weeks, provided
there is enough food.

In default configuration the craft carries two tons of cargo but can be
converted to carry eight passengers instead with minimal comfort.

##### Immigration in the Imperium

By Tim Heiderich

No matter their original homeworld, Travellers of all walks of life may
want a better place to call home. Registration is a valuable asset for
those looking to establish a permanent home within the Imperium, with
all the accompanying rights and privileges associated with a safe and
prosperous world.

Emigrating to a system with a Population, Government or Law Level of
zero is an automatic success but the following system determines the
ease of establishing residency on more desirable worlds.

REGISTERING FOR IMMIGRATION
Immigration requires an Average (8+) check on 2D, with the following
modifiers. An attempt takes 2D months to complete and the timeframe
for going faster (1D months) or slower (4D months), as described on
page 60 of the Traveller Core Rulebook. An immigration check may be
attempted once per system per year.

After qualifying for registration, Travellers may be required to meet
additional obligations to maintain their resident status, such as being
a resident for a minimum number of days, paying an annual fee or
taxes, fulfilling a contract, or performing public or military service.
Registration at multiple worlds is usually permitted as long as a
Traveller meets all requirements.

TRADE CLASSIFICATION
Each world has trade codes that make it a more or less sought-after
home, with higher or lower standards for incoming residents. The
following modifiers are used
- Agricultural DM+1
- Barren, Desert, Industrial DM+2
- Poor DM+4
- Garden, Rich, Vacuum DM-4

SYSTEM MODIFIERS
The following codes of the planetary profile apply the following modifiers
- Population 4- DM-2
- Population 9+ DM+1
- Law Level 3- DM+1
- Law Level 8+ DM-2
- Government 2–4 DM-1
- Government 11+ DM+1

TRAVELLER APPLICATION
Finally the Traveller themselves may be more or less appealing to the
government of their new home
- EDU & SOC characteristic DMs
- MCr10+ in hand DM+1
- MCr100+ in hand DM+3
- Skills DM+1 for each skill level of 3+
- Career Rank 4-5 DM+1
- Career Rank 6 DM+2
- Prisoner DM-4 per term

Mission Find Lightning's lost cousins and get them whatever help
they need

Summary Rupert Feather-Red-Bird Dark-Storm-Cloud is a Freni (see
Spinward Extents, page 241) from the alien enclave in Rupert, on
Baixing. He answers to the name 'Lightning'. He is also empathetically
'not a chef' but a master mechanic employed by the Freni-owned
repair shop Like It Never Happened in one of the seedier sections
of Rupert not far from Rupert Down Starport, the main commercial
downport on Baixing. Two of Lightning's 'cousins' – members of the
Rupert regional clan – are missing. Lightning wants the Travellers to
help him locate his cousins and – depending on circumstances – get
them out of whatever trouble they are in.

The two cousins are Rupert Whistling-Reed-Symphony Water-Red-
Frog and Rupert Orange-Grass-Wave Drops-Rain-Sheen, or 'Frog' and
'Sheen', of the Red and Orange Freni subspecies, respectively. Despite
the term cousin, they are only distantly related to Lightning or each
other. Lightning can show the Travellers a genealogy chart but it uses
curves and coloured lines and is indecipherable to most non-Freni.

The three Freni have been friends since childhood, with Frog and
Sheen being some of the few who did not ostracise Lightning for
being a hybrid. Although they had mostly gone separate ways as
adults, they have kept in contact all their lives. A few days ago, they
failed to show up to their weekly lunch at a Freni restaurant across
the street from Like It Never Happened. Lightning has been unable to
contact them through standard electronic means and has no interest
in filing a police report.

If the Travellers require a vehicle, Lightning has access to a variety of
grav vehicles from the shop, from bikes to air-rafts to grav buses but
insists on flying them himself – for liability reasons. He is, in his words,
'not a terrible pilot' but has no respect for traffic and parking regulations.
As fines accrue and pop up on the vehicle's display screen he will note
'good thing I'm not the registered owner'.

Frog is a chef at Not a Turnip, a hole-in-the-wall – but very well-
reviewed – Freni restaurant just a few blocks from the starport. Sheen
works various gigs as anything from a labourer to a musician to a tour
guide. Frog has not been at work or at home for seven Baixingian
days (of 13.5 hours). Sheen's last known address is Block 417, a sleep
cubical hostel housing a variety of aliens and some humans, and no
one there has seen Sheen in eight Baixingian days.

Lightning has contacts with seedier elements of Rupert's Freni
community and can make introductions if needed. His contact with
matriarchs within the formal Freni hierarchy are non-existent and by his
own admission Lightning's introductions would be counter-productive in
such situations.

REFEREE'S INFORMATION
Roll 1D or choose from one of the options

1–2 Frog and Sheen have been caught up in a sweep of anti-
government agitators after posting comments about the lack of
Freni representation in local government. They are being held at the
local jail while the authorities decide whether to charge them with
misdemeanour Undemocratic Tendencies or with Slander Against the
Republic, a felony with a possible 10 local (about 20 standard) year
prison term. Depending on approach, discovering this information
requires a Difficult (10+) check (1D hours, INT, EDU or SOC) using
Admin, Advocate or Electronics (computers). Getting to see either of
the detainees requires a Difficult check using skills appropriate for
the approach used. If Lightning is present and allowed to talk, apply
DM-2 to the check, as his agitation causes trouble (although some
very creative roleplaying may reverse this modifier, possibly with
unintended consequences). An exceptional failure could result in
charges against either the Travellers or Lightning.

Once the facts are determined, the Travellers can help make a plea to
the misdemeanour with an Average (8+) Advocate check (1D hours,
EDU or SOC). A misdemeanour will result in each receiving a nominal
Cr100 fine and sentence to attend 40 hours of re-education night
classes to strengthen their understanding of Baixingian democracy.
The Travellers can attempt to have all charges dropped with a Difficult
(10+) Advocate or Persuade check. If attempting any approach other
than Advocate, Lightning's presence could alter the outcome as before.
An exceptional failure results in Frog and Sheen being charged with
felonies. Convictions are nearly guaranteed in Baixingian courts and an
accredited professional defence attorney is necessary to even attempt
the Formidable (14+) skill check to avoid conviction.

If the Travellers manage to get Frog and Sheen out of jail, even with a
misdemeanour, they will receive the thanks of their new Freni friends.
They will be able to eat for free at Not a Turnip – perpetually, although
the owner will become agitated if they abuse this by eating there every
day – and get six hours of free labour from Sheen.

3–4 Frog and Sheen are in love. They plan to start a family, which will
result in hybrid offspring and shame to their families. Their families have
decided to prevent this by kidnapping the lovebirds and holding them
separately at residences owned by their respective families in the Freni
enclave's apartment towers. This fact can be discovered with a Difficult
(10+) Streetwise check (1D days, SOC) with DM-2 for non-Freni or by
tracking address changes to their universal income accounts, which
have reverted back to their respective families with a Difficult (10+)
Admin or Electronics (computers) checks.

Once this is discovered, any attempt to convince the families to let the
lovebirds go will be met by hostility and the presence of Lightning or
any hybrid will result in automatic failure. Persuasion tasks require a
plan or rationale and will require – at best – a Very Difficult (12+) check.

Another plan could be to rescue the two. Their respective families
are in communication, so a rescue of one will alert the other family,
making most tasks one level more difficult in the second attempt. Both
families have standard security systems (Very Difficult and TL10) but no
weapons and the two lovebirds are basically just locked in their rooms.
The Freni families are unarmed and will alert the police in the event of
a break-in. The police are not so diligent when responding to calls in
the Freni enclave but will arrive within 10+2D minutes. Local police are
armed with TL12 stunners and cloth armor but have shotguns in their
vehicles. Any attempt to fire upon police will result in a SWAT response
and guaranteed 10 local year sentence for survivors of the firefight.

If Frog and Sheen can be extracted, they need to leave the city. They
had planned to flee to the Whitestar Highport in orbit as the Whitestar
clan is much more tolerant of hybrids and likely to accept them. Rupert
Down is only one or two kilometers from the family residences and only
100 meters from Like It Never Happened and Not a Turnip. Departure
requires an exit visa. These are usually automatically granted but
bureaucracy and background checks require 1D local days, during
which time the families will be searching for them. Once the visas are
issued, entering the starport terminal is automatic but requires passage
through a TL12 scanner for weapons or contraband. A trip to orbit costs
only Cr50.

5–6 As 3–4, but once the families realise Frog and Sheen have
escaped they will post incriminating messages on their behalf; see
3–4 if they apply for an exit visa. If detained, family toughs armed with
improvised weapons will attempt to intercept the two as they travel
between precinct and starport.

NOTES
In all instances, Frog and Sheen, and possibly Lightning if events
warrant, may be charged with a serious crime and be arrested or
become fugitives. A legal alternative to many sentences is exile,
which would also preclude residence at Whitestar Highport. In these
instances, the Freni will need to take passage offworld. As few ships
have specialized Freni low berths, they are unwilling to take the risk
and will require at least working passage. If the Travellers have a
starship, they might want to take on one or more of them as temporary
or permanent crew. Frog has the Steward 3 skill and Sheen has Jack-
of-all-Trades 2 and INT 9, allowing minimal competence in just about
any task. Both speak Galanglic and Freni fluently (skill level 2) as a
result of their upbringing on Baixing.

If Lightning repairs any vehicle, he will do an excellent job, living up to
his shop's reputation. However, although the vehicle's odometer will
not reflect any excess travel, the vehicle's registered owner will be
responsible for 1D random moving and parking violations.

Rupert Feather-Red-Bird Dark-Storm-Cloud is a Freni hybrid neuter
born and raised within the Freni enclave in the city of Rupert on
Baixing. Dark-Storm-Cloud is his personal name but 'you can call me
Lightning'. He is short and thin with mangy orange-spotted fur and
antennae that droop heavily but bounce when he speaks. Despite
lack of gender, he insists on masculine pronouns. Unlike many Freni
he speaks grammatically correct Galanglic, although often chooses
adjectives that seem only marginally relevant. To breathe properly in
Baixing's thin atmosphere, he wears a weathered brown 'breathing
vest' – essentially a sleeveless jacket with many pockets, a fringe of
LED lights and a constant faint hissing indicating function.

Lighting will remind everyone he is a mechanic and emphatically
declare he is 'not a chef', refusing to cook, even for himself. He has
an instinctive approach to repairs and is a perfectionist, focused on
the result, not the process or even the proper parts. He will improvise
as necessary. Rupert likes grav vehicles and will always 'test drive'
them to ensure they handle properly. These test drives involve rides
through the city, violating traffic regulations, although never intentionally
endangering himself or others.

Lighting cannot shut up. He must have the last word and is
contemptuous of the Freni culture, which brands him an outsider
because of his hybrid birth. His employer is a hybrid, as are his co-
workers. Frog and Sheen are his only 'normal' friends and he is
extremely loyal to them.

##### The Black Zone Astro-Tomb

By Gary Crowther

Intrepid adventurers and interstellar explorers with the hardest of
nerves may find a lucrative adventure at the distant edge of Solomani
Confederation space, should they be willing to brave the newly
discovered Black Zone Astro-Tomb.

Thought to be a collection of derelict spaceships gathered by the
gravitational pull of a small planetoid, the Black Zone Astro-Tomb
has become a hotly debated issue among deep space Travellers and
conspiracy theorists alike. The phenomenon was first documented
three months ago when reports of distorted radio signals resembling
speech patterns and, disturbingly, childlike distress, trickled in from
vessels travelling close to the edge of the Black Zone. Since its
appearance in interstellar media, it has been dubbed the 'Bzat' (BZ-AT)
by those who believe the stories.

EXPERIENCES OF THE BZ-AT
Imperium officials publicly disregard the claims as little more than
conspiracy theories stemming from malfunctioning equipment.
However, Takashi Drell, a cargo transporter under the employ of
Kiriyama Logistics, claimed that he stumbled upon a chilling radio
frequency during one of his assignments. In his words, the signal
sounded like 'two people shouting over each other in fluctuating keys,
overlaid by weeping children'.

Continuing he stated, 'I lost the signal after a few seconds but I
managed to triangulate its location and discovered a signature coming
from just within the Black Zone. After jury-rigging a surveillance drone
and sending it in, after a few days I got some low-quality recordings
of what looked like a miniature Saturn but with a belt made up of
destroyed ships. It was not a planet at the center, though, it was
something else. It was moving, writhing...'

Tokashi neglected to elaborate on his findings and in a press release
by Kiriyama Logistics the public was informed that the hauler had not
since returned to work. Investigative journalist Rebecca Sholtz was
dispatched to Tokashi's residence in the hopes of following up on his
earlier interview. Upon arrival, she was surprised to be met with an
overly welcoming reception that edged on 'suspicious', as if Tokashi
was desperate to get her inside.

The interior of his home was reportedly a canvas of deranged
scribblings, paintings and unusual symbols etched onto every surface,
with any form of natural light being completely blocked. According to
linguistic experts, the carvings do not resemble any known language.
Tokashi's attitude during the interview was, according to Rebecca, off-
putting and made her feel incredibly uncomfortable.

When asked to explain the alien symbols and patterns carved onto the
walls, Tokashi replied, 'Matter cannot be destroyed, only rearranged.
Recycled. Repurposed. Flesh breaks down but the energy remains. Can
you hear it It's like a song sometimes, and other times, a mere whisper.'

In a separate instance, David Amos, a twice-prosecuted contraband
smuggler turned conspiracy theorist, shared an equally disturbing audio
file on his livestream. Met with mixed responses, his viewers were split on
the authenticity of the recording, with some believing it to be a marketing
hoax for an upcoming horror movie. In later days, viewers reported that his
stream had become more abstract and disturbing, with his commentary
devolving into fevered rambling about the 'music of creation'.

EXPLORING THE BZ-AT
Although far from going viral, there are pockets of ambitious salvagers
and rag-tag spacers who have expressed interest in travelling to the
starship graveyard. Amongst the remains of these ancient military and
civilian vessels, brave treasure hunters may discover their fortune, or
certain doom at the hands of whatever makes its home at the center
of the belt. Whilst more sceptical minds disregard Tokashi's claims
that the asteroid is a living entity, some are more open to the idea of
an eldritch horror.

Similar in nature to the old conspiracy theories surrounding the
historical Terran Area 51 site, the BZ-AT is proving to be a popular
point of discussion and contention for doomsayers, explorers, fringe
scientists and disillusioned youths yearning for adventure. If the
disturbing audio files collected by the likes of Tokashi and David are to
be taken to heart, it is heavily advised that all Travellers approach the
zone prepared for potential psychological distress.

Likewise, due to the lucrative prospect of finding valuable cargo and
artefacts among the rubble, and the fact that the BZ-AT is in the Black
Zone, high-grade equipment is heavily advised should the competition
turn violent. This is not an adventure for a nascent Traveller but a
seasoned and well-trained unit experienced in combat, salvaging and
perhaps even the occult.

Description Salvage Zone Omega #193 is a small planetoid orbited
by a belt of starship debris from both human and alien vessels dating
back to the Twilight War. Detailed records of the planetoid's surface
area, radius, mass, length of day and moons are currently unavailable.

Commissioned privateers, accompanied by Imperium researchers,
have been dispatched to gather data on #193's aforementioned
unknown specifications, suppress unsanctioned salvaging and recover
materials from the debris. Information regarding the sentient nature of
the planetoid is also to be determined.
