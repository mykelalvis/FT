### Zirunkariish

Zirunkariish is a Vilani firm, but one without roots in the
great Bureaus. It was founded in –425, during the Long Night.
Zirunkariish is primarily an investment and banking firm, and is the
largest insurance under–writer in the Imperium. It also funds the
development of mid–tech worlds and starports on major routes.
Zirunkariish is a majority shareholder in several major starport
projects, though it rarely takes much interest in direct ownership.
The firm is content to provide capital and take its profit, leaving
management to others who are (hopefully) experts in the field.
Exactly how much Zirunkariish is worth, and how much influence
it has, is open to speculation. With few physical assets it is difficult
to make even a general estimate of the firm's value. However, the
amount is staggeringly large – that much is certain.
In recent years Zirunkariish has been accused of manipulating the
money markets due to its effective ownership of many worlds' hard
currency reserves. Essentially the firm has loaned capital to a number
of worlds, secured against their reserves. There is nothing wrong
with this, it being standard practice. However, persistent rumors
suggest that Zirunkariish is somehow using its influence over these
worlds to create a favorable investment climate elsewhere.

Zirunkariish is a financial and investment corporation, with offices at major ports on the main trade routes. It does not deal with minor clients but can put together huge investment packages for those with the resources to afford them. Zirunkariish is hard-nosed in its dealings and has shown itself quite willing to bankroll both sides in a conflict. This actually makes it a force for a sort of stability, as a crushing defeat may prevent a faction from repaying creditors. Zirunkariish is openly profiting from the state of conflict in the region and in more than one way. It provides secure currency transfer and escrow services for major purchases of military hardware, hiring of mercenary forces and so forth. This means that Zirunkariish has to move shiploads of gold, hard currency and other precious items, creating a very attractive target for pirates but mostly it deals in reliable electronic transfers of funds.
