# The Laboratory Ship

Research is an unending pursuit within the [[Imperium]]. A constant effort to further understand and harness the universe produces more than knowledge; it creates products, markets, jobs and profits. Given the numerous scientific projects, it is only natural for mobile research platforms to be designed and made available at reasonable prices.

The Calipso-class laboratory ship is one example. Using a 400-ton hull, the laboratory ship is a movable research and development station used for routine commercial experimentation. The ship has one 40-ton pinnace and two air/rafts. Cargo capacity is 21 tons and there are two laboratories totalling 85 tons.

The laboratory ship requires a crew of five: a pilot, astrogator, medic and two engineers. The pilot also operates the pinnace. Gunners may be added if the ship is armed and additional crew are carried to execute research functions.

This ship is built as a ring structure, which is rotated to provide centrifugal gravity simulation. Although standard grav plates and inertial compensators are installed, they may be turned off and centrifugal force used instead in order to remove grav forces as a variable in experiments. Two drive pods are mounted on the ring, containing the drives and power plant. The pods serve as hardpoints if turret weaponry is called for.

Two air/rafts provide access to world surfaces, both for specimen gathering and routine errands. A 40-ton pinnace is carried at the end of a central spoke, making mating easy even if the ring is rotating.

## Operations

Typically, a laboratory ship is purchased (or chartered) and assigned to a system or world for specific research projects. After jumping to the system, the ship takes up orbit and begins its regimen of experiments. Laboratory ships are capable of moving great distances but generally remain in one place for long periods of time. Once in a system, solar panels can be extended, allowing it to use one-quarter of the fuel normally required for ship systems. The air/rafts are used for routine transport while the pinnace is reserved for heavier work or missions requiring greater speed. Minor thrusters along the laboratory ship's ring allow it to initiate or stop spin as desired. The ship is unstreamlined and cannot skim fuel itself. The 40-ton pinnace is assigned the task of skimming gas giants and ferrying fuel to the laboratory ship.

## Experimentation

[[Lysani Laboratories]] is engaged in psychochemical research, with the primary goal of achieving improved types of combat drugs. The activity is legitimate but shrouded in secrecy because of its high profit potential. Harvesting several plants from the planet's surface, Lysani scientists aboard the laboratory ship Calendula discovered several species containing the psychochemicals required for combat drugs. As would be expected, the wild plants merely provide the base chemicals, which must be further refined, but results have been promising. Eager investors have begun placing more pressure on the scientists, shortening deadlines and demanding constant progress reports.

There are other reasons for secrecy as well. The three main scientists engaged in the research have been using sophont subjects in order to perfect the drug formulations more quickly. The Calendula's astrogator, [[#Haris Slocombe]], has been working as a spy, copying reports and sending them to a rival chemical company in return for a pay-off. In all, the entire project has been poorly managed.

## The Blow-up

The astrogator received instructions from [[Butler Chemical]] to delay progress in the drug research. Stupidly, he decided a simple explosion would be the best means of causing such a delay. Seven nights ago, he rigged a bomb in the [[#13. Auxiliary Laboratory|auxiliary laboratory]], set its timer and then retired to his stateroom. There, he settled into a bottle and got completely drunk. While he drank, the bomb detonated. It was the night shift and the laboratory was unoccupied. Actual damage was rather low but vaporised combat drugs disseminated through the ventilation system.

The two drugs have relatively innocuous effects alone but together they synergised. That is to say, they interacted with each other to achieve an effect far out of proportion to their individual ones. For 40% of sophonts, the result is a painful death: reacting together, the two drugs formed a fast-acting poison. Eight of the 20 crew and staff were killed. The remaining 12 personnel suffered a different fate.

## The Drug Effects

The 12 survivors were each affected differently by the drugs. The exact effects differ according to body mass, metabolism and other factors; the general effect increases personal physical characteristics but leaves mental characteristics relatively untouched.

These effects last for an hour; thereafter, the individual is fatigued and ravenously hungry. The drug promotes flashbacks, however, resulting in recurring 12-hour cycles of heightened strength and extreme aggression.

Two other effects resulted from the drugs' combination. First, those affected have an aversion to light. Pupils are dilated, increasing night vision but making standard illumination levels painful to the subject. Second, overwhelming aggressive instincts suppress any civilised inhibitions. They become combative and are prone to attack sources of pain or irritation. This is the reason for the many smashed light fixtures. Although the individuals retain the ability to find and use light switches, the suppressed inhibitions lead instead to simple destruction.

Finally, the [[#Haris Slocombe|drunken astrogator]] was subjected to a variation of the drug effects. Due to the high level of alcohol in his bloodstream, the effects of the drugs were heightened and further twisted from normal. In addition to boosting his physical characteristics, the drugs increased his intelligence.

Within seconds of exposure the surviving crew began brutally attacking each other. In the seven days since, they have hunted and killed one another until only four remain. With the ship's food stores plundered or destroyed during these violent cycles, the survivors turned to eating laboratory animals and finally, to eating each other.

# Introducing the Travellers

Required Skills: Recon, Survival

Reward: Cr1500 and a meal voucher, or Cr12000 and middle passage offworld for each Traveller

Mission: Investigate the [[Calendula]] , report back to [[#Dalglee Hahsh]]

This adventure can easily be used as a sequel to [[TGR Adventure 3 - Flatlined]]. To do so, have the mining camp belong to [[Sternmore Minerals]] Incorporated. The cryoberth test subjects can be further victims of the skill-jacking ring, possibly the Travellers' former friends and crewmates. The amnesia drugs may have been produced in the Calendula's laboratories.

High above a backwater world, the laboratory ship Calendula has gone silent. Believing it nothing more than a downed transmitter, the Travellers are sent to investigate. Inside they discover a grisly scene of corporate espionage, illegal medical experiments, betrayal and murder. Worse yet, they are not alone. The only thing worse than the Calendula's dead are the Calendula's living... and they are hungry.

The Travellers are on a backwater world with less than 1,000 inhabitants. What passes as a starport is a corporate mining camp of around 400 people strip-mining ore for processing and shipment. Most of the workers signed on believing it was a good deal. However, their wages are not quite high enough to cover the expensive subsistence and many are now indebted over their heads to the company store.

![[DeathS-019.jpg|300]]

## A Patron!

Dalglee Hahsh, a Bwap, is the local agent for [[Lysani Laboratories]]. He lives in the camp and apparently gets along well with the mining company. During a morning meal, Dalglee shuffles into the mess hall and announces he is looking for volunteers.

The agent is concerned that he cannot get communication from the [[Lysani Labs]] ship Calendula stationed in orbit. He needs a team to go up and check out the station. He will provide the use of an air/raft and TL10 vacc suits.

Dalglee believes this may be just a routine communications breakdown but company policy requires he have it investigated once 168 hours have passed since the last communication. If it is merely a faulty transmitter or the like, he will pay Cr1500 per Traveller and they can get a good meal at the station (he gives them each a voucher for this).

If there is a bigger problem, he needs a complete report. He will pay for the report with a one-off payment of Cr12000 and a middle passage offworld for each of the Travellers. Reaching the ship should take three hours by air/raft, meaning they should arrive just in time for lunch.

## Approaching the Calendula

When the laboratory ship is approached, the most striking feature observed is the ring's rotation. The play of light and shadow constantly reveals new facets along the exterior hull. Not rotating, however, is the docked pinnace. The structure at the end of the single spoke is specifically mounted to counteract the ship's rotation, making docking easier for lesser-skilled pilots.

The solar collectors are extended and navigation lights appear to be working as normal. Most of the windows are dark, although a few show light inside. The station obviously has power but does not respond to radio hails. A close flyby inspection of the comms array finds no obvious damage with a Routine (6+) Electronics (comms) check (1D minutes, INT).

## The Body

An Average (8+) Recon check notices a gruesome sight. A human corpse floats 60 metres from the station. The body is of a male wearing no more than a pair of light trousers. The flesh of his back is lacerated. An Easy (4+) Medic check identifies that these wounds are not the result of explosive decompression.

On the night of the sabotage, one scientist was chased into the empty air/raft bay. His attacker opened the bay doors, blowing the injured man into space. The faint field caused by the laboratory ship's gravitic plates pulled his body into a slow orbit.

## A Survivor

An Average (8+) Recon check spots movement in one of the Calendula's windows (room 11). A filthy, wild-eyed face peers out at them before ducking out of sight. Travellers approaching the window for a better look see no one inside.

## Entry Points

Four entry points to the ship are immediately obvious to observers. They are the two air/raft bays, the cargo access plate beneath the main laboratory and the docking ring for the research pinnace.

The air/raft bays normally contain an air/raft each. They are airlocks and can be accessed using one of the ship's vehicles; the air/rafts have remote controls that can open the bay doors. The air/raft Dalglee offered is equipped with one of these remote controls. A makeshift trigger can be constructed with an Average (8+) Electronics (computers) check (1D hours, INT).

The cargo access plate to the main laboratory is a heavy, fully secured sliding panel normally used for the installation of research equipment. It is not normally opened and requires the depressurisation of the entire main laboratory. Unbolting the access plate requires at least two persons and 1D hours.

The docking ring can be entered by any six-metre diameter vessel; entry to the spoke is then quite easy. If no six-metre diameter vessel is available, then the manual hatch on the spoke can be opened and the ship entered with an Average (8+) Mechanic check (1D minutes, EDU or INT). Unfortunately, the docked pinnace currently blocks access to this entrance from the outside.

Simplistic solutions to the entry problem (such as cutting through the hull or blasting the ship with laser fire) should be discouraged as being detrimental to the ship's interior and anyone inside.

# Inside the Death Station

The Calendula's interior fittings are the standard for the Calipso-class [[#Laboratory Ship]].

## Interior Walls

Interior walls are partitions: non-load-bearing panels firmly fixed in place. They are not pressure-tight and cannot withstand a concerted assault.

Inflicting 20 damage to a wall with an energy weapon burns a hole large enough for one person to pass through per round; an explosion causing 20 damage produces the same effect. Slug weapons are less efficient in doing this sort of damage; such a weapon must produce 200 damage before creating a human-sized hole.

Sliding doors are set in interior walls. Such doors save space over conventional swinging doors, so are standard on most starships. They are not air-tight and merely serve as privacy screens. They may be broken down by weapons in the same manner as interior walls.

Sliding doors are powered and open completely (assuming ship power is on) when a wall stud beside the door is pressed. Such doors may be locked (from either side, both sides or by the ship's computer). A red light on the control panel indicates if a door is locked. When ship power is off, sliding doors do not operate automatically but they may be overridden manually with a brute force Average (8+) STR check; a crowbar or similar tool grants DM+1.

## Bulkheads

The major structural components of a ship are the bulkheads and they represent the compartmentalisation of the ship for damage control and environment maintenance as well as the ship's outer hull. Bulkheads are very difficult to destroy. A concerted effort with an energy weapon or explosive must produce 200 damage in order to create a hole large enough for a human to step through. Slug-firing weapons are ineffective against bulkheads.

All deck floors are assumed to be bulkheads.

## Maintenance Hatches

At various points, small, unobtrusive maintenance hatches are installed in bulkheads, allowing for repair or access to machinery or equipment. Maintenance hatches are not commonly used; that is to say, they stand closed and are generally ignored most of the time. Only rarely do crew and passengers even recognise their existence. Maintenance hatches are unpowered and lock with a common service key. On this ship, one key fits all maintenance hatches; there is a key stored in a compartment in the pilot's couch on the bridge and one hangs on the wall in each drive pod.

## Life Shaft

Elevators lifting personnel or goods between decks are called lift shafts. In the laboratory ship, this consists of a pressure-tight lift car and a shaft extending along the spoke leading to the docking ring. Ordinary sliding doors close the shaft when a lift car is not present. The lift car itself is sealed with a pressure-tight sliding door. Between decks, the lift shaft is sealed by pressure doors, maintaining integrity between the decks.

## Iris Valves

Iris valves are pressure-tight automatic portals set in bulkheads.

A valve functions much like the iris of a camera; many panels retract into the frame to leave an open passage or extend to block the portal with solid metal. Iris valves may be horizontal or vertical. The deck plan symbols chart shows the various combinations possible. Iris valves are operated by pressing a button on the wall beside the valve. A valve may be locked from either side or by the ship's computer. A red light on the indicator panel denotes if a valve is locked. Valves cannot be forced closed if already open.

Valves are very difficult to force open once fully closed. A Difficult (10+) STR check is required to force open a closed iris valve with DM+2 if ship power is off and DM-8 if locked. Gunfire and explosions simply block the valve tighter. Iris valves close automatically when a pressure difference is sensed between the two sides of the bulkhead. They do not fully close until the valve is clear of any foreign objects (like legs, hands and so forth).

## Manual Hatches

Cheaper substitutes for iris valves are manual hatches. These are hinged pressure doors secured by a handwheel and extending bars. They are not automatic and have no interaction with the ship's computer, although there may be a sensor that tells the computer if a hatch is open or closed.

Interior Conditions Normal conditions approximate those of a habitable world surface. The Travellers are most likely wearing vacc suits. Once they have entered the interior, they should be encouraged to remove helmets and gloves at the very least; continuing to wear helmets and gloves imposes DM-2 for any checks requiring delicate finger manipulation, auditory or visual input. Travellers in vacc helmets receive no olfactory information.

## Lighting

Many areas within the ship are fully and comfortably lit. The light intensity can be controlled by computer instruction or by simple wall switches. Switches can be adjusted to activate through manual, voice or motion sensors, depending on the user's preference. Some areas such as the cargo hold or maintenance ducts may be poorly lit. Other areas have no light, due to smashed fixtures. Some areas such as the bridge may be lit with red light to preserve the night vision of personnel assigned there.

## Gravity

The laboratory ship has grav plates built into the flooring. These plates produce standard gravity within the interior. Acceleration compensators are also installed, to negate the effects of high acceleration and lateral G forces while manoeuvring. A ship's passengers would be unable to tell whether they were moving through space or grounded on a planet without looking out a viewscreen.

The grav plates can be deactivated and interior gravity provided by centrifugal force if local gravity effects are to be eliminated as a variable from experiments. The ship is currently rotating but the grav plates are also on. Deactivating the grav plates still leaves the centrifugal effects of the ship rotation, which places gravity at 0.5G (see [[TravellerCore#Low Gravity]]).

## Power

Ship power is on and all interior mechanisms are functioning. Light switches are easily found in each room. A prominent power-on switch on the bridge (another is located in each drive pod) controls all power to the ship. Turning off power douses the lights and cuts the grav plates.

## Atmosphere

The interior of the ship is fully pressurised and an atmosphere tester indicates breathable gases; there is no apparent (or real) danger of losing pressure at present. If pressure is lost in an area, tracing its effects on the deck plans shows which areas are in immediate danger. Iris valves automatically close to minimise depressurisation.

A Routine (6+) Engineer (life support) check (1D minutes, EDU) of the Calendula's life support system from any working terminal shows the air is clean of any dangerous chemicals or microbes. However, a warning light indicates that the filters should be replaced.

## Computer Terminals

Several terminals are located around the ship, granting access to the ship's computer, life support and security feed. Only authorised individuals may use them. A Difficult (10+) Electronics (computers) check (1Dx10 minutes, INT) grants a Traveller access to those systems. Survivors may be persuaded to grant Travellers access to the terminals.

Terminals are located at:

- [[#8. Bridge]]
- [[#19. Auxiliary Bridge]]
- [[#1. Main Laboratory]]
- [[#13. Auxiliary Laboratory]]
- [[#6.Drive Pod Number One Upper Level]]
- [[#16. Drive Pod Number Two Upper Level]]
- [[#32. Reception Area]]

Many of the terminals have been smashed beyond repair. The only working terminals are located in the [[#8. Bridge]], [[#19. Auxiliary Bridge]], [[#6.Drive Pod Number One Upper Level]] and the [[#32. Reception Area]].

## Ships's Computer

Accessing the computer can only be performed at a working and unlocked computer terminal (see Computer Terminals).

Due to company security, the ship's computer has no information about the laboratory and its experiments. The computer's memory can be scanned on an Average (8+) Electronics (computers) check (1Dx10 minutes, EDU) and the following information can be obtained:

1. Regular, routine communicator transmissions of laboratory reports have been made daily to Lysani Laboratories, the registered chartering company for this ship. The transmissions, sent to the mining company on the world surface below for forwarding are coded but can be easily decoded.
2. A dozen other transmissions were also sent and received over the last five months but any further information about them has been erased. A Difficult (10+) Electronics (computers) check (1Dx10 minutes, EDU) or an Average (8+) Electronics (comms) check (1Dx10 minutes, EDU) reveals that the outgoing messages included the same laboratory reports as the daily transmissions. These messages are encrypted in a more complex code (although still readable through the computer) and addressed to the [[Butler Chemical]] Company (a competitor of [[Lysani Laboratories]]). There is no record of what the incoming messages contained but they were sent to [[#Haris Slocombe]], the Calendula's astrogator. The last incoming message was received the day before the auxiliary laboratory explosion.
3. The visitor roster for the last four months lists several mercenary officers. This fact should serve as a hint that a combat drug is involved in the laboratory research.
4. Profiles for each of the ship's 20 crew members, including biometric data. This data may be used to identify bodies.
5. A search of the name Willow Dawn in the ship's library reveals a ship of that name was reported missing three months ago.
6. Security camera logs (see [[#Security Cameras]]).
7. Life Support records indicate that at 01:30 one week ago, an explosion occurred in the auxiliary laboratory. A resulting power surge temporarily disabled several functions. Once back online, sensors detected an unknown chemical in the air. Fully scrubbing the chemical took 20 hours. By that time, the chemical had already infiltrated every quadrant of the ship (see [[#Atmosphere]]).

> [!info]- IDENTIFYING BODIES ^identify
> Using the life sciences toolkit found in the main laboratory to identify any crew remains against the biometric data grants DM+1. Testing requires a Routine (6+) Medic or Science (biology) check (1D minutes, EDU).

## Security Cameras

As with most starships, security cameras are only found in all public areas. Most of the cameras aboard the Calendula have been smashed. An Easy (4+) Electronics (computers) check (1Dx10 minutes, INT) from any unlocked and working terminal can access the security feed and video records. Several things can be learned from these records:

- One week ago, while the crew was asleep, the cameras to the auxiliary laboratory were intentionally shut off for 10 minutes.
- An hour later, an explosion rocked the auxiliary laboratory, destroying the cameras inside.
- Minutes later, several crew members emerged from their staterooms and began savagely attacking one another. Several were killed. The crew began smashing light fixtures and cameras.
- Over the last four months, the ship received a total of six deliveries of cryoberths from mercenary crews. The berths appear occupied.

### Interior Configuration

The [[#Laboratory Ship|deck plans]] portray the Calendula's interior. The ship is divided into four quadrants, numbered one to four. The end of each quadrant is labelled with a letter and a notation of which quadrant end it joins with.

The curvature of the ring also affects line-of-sight within the ship. Along the length of the ring, two people of average height can see each other at eye level from nine metres. A standing person can see the deck at 11.2 metres and a person with his eyes at deck-level can see the deck 13.5 metres away. Naturally, gunfire is affected in the same way.

### The Deck Plans

Individual rooms are numbered within the deck plans; rooms are discussed in numerical order within sections devoted to the four quadrants.

![[DeathS-025.jpg]]

## Laboratory Ship

**LABORATORY SHIP CLASS:Calipso**

The Calipso-class laboratory ship is a variant of the more common [[TravellerCore#Laboratory Ship|Type L]], although it shares much in common with them. Based upon a 400-ton hull, it has slightly less laboratory space but boasts greater cargo capacity, can remain deployed without resupply much longer and houses a second air/raft, reducing reliance on the onboard pinnace.

![[DeathS-028-2.jpg|300]]
[[DeathS-028-2.jpg|Deck Plans]]

### Quadrant Four

#### 1. Main Laboratory

Quadrant four consists entirely of the main laboratory. Almost all of the laboratory is in darkness. A multicoloured glow flickers from a single computer monitor near the centre of the laboratory. The end nearest the floor access plate is still lit by ceiling fixtures. The rest of the room is dark and the lighting fixtures are smashed. A sharp chemical stink fills the air.

Much of the laboratory is outfitted with various chemical apparatus. Experimental tables line the walls and run down the centre of the room.

Two aisles lead down the length of the laboratory; occasional breaks in the tables allow shifting from each aisle to the other every 10 metres or so. Many of the tables are outfitted with various chemical apparatus. Some (about one table in 10) are knocked over or broken; the rest stand in various states of use or disuse. None of the laboratory equipment is currently operating and many examples are stained from lack of attention, or dirty from lack of cleaning.

An Average (8+) Investigate check (1Dx10 minutes, INT) discovers one item and an additional item for every time rolled. Multiple Travellers may roll and uncover whichever items the Referee desires. Referees may also add new items as they deem appropriate.

> [!info]- ITEMS IN THE ROOM

> - TL12 medikit
> - Stunstick
> - Wrist restraints
> - Laser scalpel
> - Life sciences toolkit
> - Physical sciences toolkit

##### The Computer

A small personal computer (TL12, Computer/3) sits on a table near the centre of the laboratory. This is not the ship's computer but merely a scientist's research tool. Moving data flashes across its cracked screen – lines of text and molecular models assembling and disassembling.

This computer is processing elementary data about the laboratory's experiments. Each of the five experiments (numbered randomly) is momentarily displayed and then is replaced by the next. Travellers wishing to note the exact data being shown must watch the screen flash through several cycles (2D minutes).

An Easy (4+) Electronics (computers) check (1D minutes, EDU or INT) stops the display, allowing access to the experiments' information. Failure with Effect -2 or less results in the computer shutting off and losing the data.

The data includes the code number, general title, location within the ship and a list of raw results for each of five experiments: they are numbered 1067, 1077, 1079, 1101 and 1103. An Average (8+) Science (biology), Science (chemistry) or Medic check (1D minutes, EDU) understands that the experiments pertain to combat drugs.

##### The Lair

In a darkened far section of the laboratory, several tables have been overturned to create a small den or lair. It is padded with bedding and trash, and just outside the tables is a pile of garbage, including small bones and excrement.

One table is completely overturned and lies next to the wall. If it is moved, Travellers discover a hole in the flooring leading to the fuel tankage below. The flooring and the tank have been cut with a laser or torch and the jagged edges padded with wadded-up bed clothing. The passage is filthy and well-used.

### Quadrant Three

Quadrant three consists of a cargo bay, the hangar for air/raft number 1, drive pod number 1, the bridge and several crew staterooms.

#### 2. Cargo Bay

The area is dimly lit but all lighting fixtures are intact. Wall switches can raise lighting levels. This 19.8-ton cargo storage area appears to be a standard chamber, with bare metal walls and tie-down fittings on the ceiling and floor. The wall between the cargo bay and the air/ raft hangar is a large sliding door. This door allows transport and shipment of bulky cargo from the air/raft if required. Many large crates and storage containers fill the bay. Some are empty. Their markings indicate they once contained scientific instruments. They are now being kept until needed.

Five empty cryoberths are shoved against the bulkhead. One stands open. _Willow Dawn_ is stencilled along the sides.

A large, air-tight crate appears to have been used for the transport of live animal specimens. The remnants of several small specimen cages lay scattered across the floor behind it. Closer inspection reveals blood and fur smeared on the walls and floor but no sign of the animals themselves.

#### 3. Drive Pod Number One Lower Level

This area is well lit, with all fixtures intact. This lower level of the drive pod contains part of the ship's jump drive. It is accessed using the corridor and hatches leading up to the second level.

The walls of this chamber are plastered with posters and instructional aids for the jump drive. The various materials are distributed by the drive manufacturers and used in the education of apprentice engineers. A clearly labelled maintenance hatch key is taped to the wall behind one of the posters.

#### 4. Air/Raft Number One

The lighting fixtures have been smashed, leaving the room almost completely unilluminated. The standard air/ raft is firmly secured in place with bright yellow straps. A sliding cargo door leads to the adjacent cargo bay.

#### 5. Hardpoint Number One

Bloody handprints smear the door and wall panel. The door is locked and its surface is dented and scarred from dozens of hard blows. Once opened, a terrible stench wafts out. Inside is dark and there are no lighting fixtures installed. This forward portion of the drive pod is intended to be fitted with a turret and weaponry but none have been installed.

A woman's decomposing body lies curled up opposite the door. [[#^identify|Testing her biometrics]] against those of the crewmembers reveals that she is not listed among the crew. The name _Willow Dawn_ is printed across the back of her grey jumpsuit.

> ![info]- Referee Info
> This woman was kidnapped from the _Willow Dawn_, loaded into a cryoberth and sold to the Calendula's scientists for testing. The disruption in ship's power from the explosion activated the berth's thawing cycle. She emerged from the berth hours later, not knowing where she was. A maddened crewmember attacked her, stabbing her with a knife. She managed to escape and lock herself inside before succumbing to her wounds.

#### 6.Drive Pod Number One Upper Level

This drive pod level is well lit. The upper level of the drive pod extends inward toward the centre of the ring. It contains the power plant and the manoeuvre drive. This entire area is completely unused, although the power plant continues to function without supervision. The computer terminal is fully operational. Containers of spare parts currently fill the room's single ton of cargo space. A thin layer of dust coats all surfaces.

#### 7. Corridor

The corridor is poorly lit; every second ceiling light is on. The remaining lights have been computer-dimmed but flicker on once movement is detected. This small, narrow corridor leads past the drive pod from the cargo bay to the bridge.

#### 8. Bridge

The bridge is well-lit, except for the end farthest away from the drive pod (toward room 9); there, the last three fixtures in the ceiling have been smashed. Two control couches are positioned in this large room: one for the pilot and one for the astrogator. The maintenance hatch key is missing from its compartment in the pilot's couch. Surrounding the couches are the basic instruments for ship operation and all appear to be in operating order. A large wall screen provides images of the ship's course and nearby bodies. A single shoe lies in the middle of the floor.

The computer terminals are functional.

#### 9. Pilot's Stateroom

This room is well lit. This cabin is a standard stateroom used by the command pilot. Its position close to the bridge ensures they are always available for duty. The single bunk's mattress has been thrown on the floor. Clothing and personal possessions are strewn about. A broken perfume bottle fills the room with a flowery scent.

#### 10. Astrogator's Stateroom

No light can be seen but the fixtures are operational and respond to the wall switch. This standard crew cabin belongs to the ship's astrogator, [[#Haris Slocombe]]. It appears neat and relatively undisturbed. An empty bottle of cheap vodka lies beside the bunk. A TL portable computer tablet sits on the table. Accessing it requires an Average (8+) Electronics (computers) check (1Dx10 minutes, INT) or [[#Haris Slocombe|Haris's]] right thumbprint.

In the computer, the Travellers discover messages between [[#Haris Slocombe|Haris]] and a [[Butler Chemicals]] agent over the last five months. They detail the stolen information and sabotage plot. The last message from the Astrogator says he placed the bomb in the [[#13. Auxiliary Laboratory|auxiliary laboratory]]. It is dated 20 minutes before the explosion.

#### 11. Medic's Stateroom

This room is well lit. The interior is relatively neat but two bottles of whiskey have been smashed in the centre of the floor. Some blood is visible on close examination and a trail of blood leads out from the cabin into the corridor. There, the spatter disappears at the iris valve leading to quadrant two. If tested, the blood belongs to the medic.

#### 12. First Engineer's Stateroom

The room is dark and the ceiling lighting fixtures have been smashed. The entire stateroom has been violently torn up, with the desk ripped from the wall and the bunk smashed. The mattress is missing.

### Quadrant One

Quadrant one contains an auxiliary laboratory, the hangar for air/raft number 2, drive pod number 2 and several staff staterooms.

#### 13. Auxiliary Laboratory

This area is dark and all ceiling lighting fixtures have been smashed. An acrid burnt odour fills the room. The auxiliary laboratory is essentially identical in form and purpose to the main laboratory. The primary difference is that it is smaller.

The entire area is completely wrecked and most of the equipment and apparatus have been destroyed by an explosion. The blast shattered various pipes and conduits in the walls and buckled the floor. Although pressurisation has not been lost, hull integrity may have been compromised, making this area in need of inspection and possible repair before the ship is used for any purpose.

An Average (8+) Investigation check (1Dx10 minutes, INT) discovers one item and an additional item for every Effect rolled. Multiple Travellers may roll and uncover whichever items the Referee desires. Referees may also add new items as they deem appropriate.

> - Wrist restraints

##### Lair

A pile of broken tables and benches is piled against the wall at one end of the room (near the air/raft hangar).

Closer inspection discovers a small, carefully concealed crawlway through the wreckage, leading to a lair or burrow within. If the pile is dismantled, a recently cut access hole leads to the fuel tank below.

As with the one in the main laboratory, the edges are padded with bed clothing.

#### 14. Air/Raft Number Two

This area is dark and the lighting fixtures have been smashed. The air/raft itself is missing, showing the large retractable floor panels that allow entry by the air/ raft. Bloody handprints stain the rear wall. If tested, the blood belongs to the scientist found floating outside the ship. The room itself is clear of any debris.

#### 15. Drive Pod Number Two Lower Level

The lighting may be turned on with a wall switch, otherwise nothing can be seen within. This lower level of the drive pod contains part of the ship's jump drive. The maintenance key is missing from its wall mount. Ladders lead up to the second level. One hatch is sealed and welded shut. The other hatch opens normally.

#### 16. Drive Pod Number Two Upper Level

This area is dark and the lighting fixtures have been smashed. As with drive pod one, the area is large enough to provide a single ton of cargo space, normally stocked with spare parts. This room is the lair of the engineer, [[#Pent Stavro]]. Stacked crates form a fortified wall between the entrance and his sleeping area.

##### Trap!

A Difficult (10+) Recon check (1D seconds, INT or EDU) notices a taut, slender wire just inside the unlocked hatch. If triggered, a sharpened pneumatic piston shoots out, skewering anyone entering the room. The spike inflicts 3D damage and must be reset after it is activated. Travellers must roll Initiative against the trap or be subject to its attack. Travellers caught by surprise suffer DM-6 to this roll, while the trap receives DM+6 on its Initiative. Disarming or avoiding the trap is simple if the Traveller is aware of it.

##### Lair

Stuffed in one corner of the chamber is a pile of cloth and mattresses. Scattered garbage, including bones and paper wrappings, litters the floor around the bedclothes.

The computer terminal in this room has been destroyed.

#### 17. Corridor

This corridor is dark and all of the ceiling light fixtures have been smashed. This narrow corridor leads through the drive pod from the auxiliary laboratory to the row of staff staterooms.

#### 18. Hardpoint Number Two

There are no lighting fixtures installed here. As with hardpoint number one, this area could hold a turret and weaponry. It does not and no weaponry has ever been installed. Several cartons are piled in the far corner.

The cartons are personal goods belonging to one of the crew. They include books, clothes and various personal items such as a necklace of beads, a silver-studded leather belt and a sprig of green leaf in a block of clear acrylic.

#### 19. Auxiliary Bridge

This small, well-lit room connects with iris valves to both the corridor and the drive pod. It serves as a stand-by or emergency bridge for the ship. Just as the main bridge is adjacent to drive pod number one, this one is adjacent to drive pod number two. It is used to manage drive tests and to replace the main bridge in the event of a disaster. It holds complete operating controls and a working computer terminal.

#### 20. Staff Stateroom A

This stateroom is dark but the lights may be activated from the wall switch The stateroom, normally used by one of the research staff, is empty. All of the cloth from within, including sheets, blankets, mattress and clothing, has been removed.

#### 21. Staff Stateroom  B

Broken glass coats the stateroom, remnants of lighting fixtures that have been smashed. The room stinks, assumedly due to the dead crew member lying in the centre of the floor.

The body has been dead for several days and is the obvious source of the smell. One leg has been torn off and is missing. Rodents have chewed away her eyes and most of her lips, giving her a horrific sort of grin. The stateroom is otherwise empty and all cloth within has been removed.

#### 22. Staff Stateroom  C

This stateroom is dark and the ceiling lighting fixtures have been smashed. A few personal effects lay scattered about and all cloth within has been removed.

![[DeathS-036.jpg]]

#### 23. Staff Stateroom  D

The interior is normal and untouched, being both well-lit and surprisingly clean. The bed is made and the drawers are closed. A search of the drawers discovers a snub pistol hidden beneath the folded clothes.

#### 24. Staff Stateroom E

The ceiling lighting fixtures have been smashed. The bunk is torn from the wall and materials have been piled in one corner into a barricade.

##### Trap!

An Average (8+) Recon check (1D seconds, INT or EDU) spots a tripwire across the doorway. If triggered, a metal arm lined with sharpened spikes swings from the neighbouring wall. It inflicts 2D Damage and must be reset once activated. Travellers must roll Initiative against the trap or be subject to its attack. Travellers caught by surprise suffer DM-6 to this roll, while the trap receives DM+6 on its Initiative. Disarming or avoiding the tripwire is simple if the Traveller is aware of it.

##### The Lair

Behind the barricade, a hole cut in the floor leads to the fuel tank. The hole is concealed beneath a mattress and its edges have been padded with bedclothes.

#### 25. Staff Stateroom  F

This stateroom is dark but the lights may be turned on by the wall switch. Debris covers the floor as if the contents of every drawer and shelf had been dumped there. The room has been stripped of cloth, including mattress and bedclothes.

### Quadrant Two

Quadrant two contains staff staterooms, the ship's reception foyer, the galley and mess area. It also contains access to the spoke leading to the research pinnace.

#### 26. Staff Stateroom G (Library)

The room is dark but motion sensors activate the lights as the Travellers enter. Originally intended as a stateroom, this room has been converted to a scientific library.

Three TL13 computers are mounted near comfortable reading chairs. Each has a charging stand for a TL data display headset, although two of the headsets lay in pieces on the floor.

One wall is covered with shelves containing data wafers. Typical titles are long and boringly scientific. Several trays of wafers are scattered on the floor. In order to prevent hacking and theft of company secrets, all scientific research is stored on physical media and not connected to the ship's computer network.

This room should appear to be a potential source of information on the research going on in this ship. However, without additional information, all that can be learned is that the research is biochemical.

If other information is found, and then this room is checked, specific questions can be answered. Typically, a Difficult (10+) EDU check (1D hours) is required for any real understanding of the data. An Average (8+) Science (biology or chemistry) check (1D hours, EDU) grasps a deeper understanding.

> [!info]- INFORMATION FROM THE LIBRARY COMPUTER
>
> - Effects and detailed reports about the five combat drugs being tested.
> - Video recordings of clinical trials on animals.
> - Video recordings of illegal sophont testing. In the videos, the subjects are bound to tables and shouting they do not know where they are or what is going on. Once injected, most early subjects experience seizures, haemorrhaging veins and a painful death as scientists in laboratory coats calmly watch and record their findings. Subjects that manage to break their bonds once the drugs have taken effect are subdued with stunsticks.

#### 27. Staff Stateroom  H

This room is dark but the wall switch works. Photographs of a smiling couple cover one wall. Comparing the faces to those of the crew, one can be identified as Gail Rinch, a laboratory assistant.

#### 28. Staff Stateroom  I

The room has been stripped of all cloth, including bedclothes and mattress, and the lights have been smashed. An Average (8+) Investigate check (1D minutes, EDU or INT) discovers indications of a heavy object being dragged from the room and small blood smears along the wall near the door.

#### 29. Staff Stateroom  J

Undisturbed and well-lit, nothing of importance can be seen.

#### 30. Staff Stateroom  K

A stench of rotting meat fills the hallway outside. This room is dimly lit; three of the four ceiling lighting fixtures have been smashed. The fourth flickers with a low hum. The bed mattress and sheets have been taken from this room. A long wooden pole lies on the floor. The instrument was used to smash light fixtures but has been abandoned for some reason.

The closet door for this stateroom is slightly ajar. Disturbing it causes it to swing open. As it does, the body of a dead crewmember falls out, face up. Over 30 stab wounds are visible across the torso and arms.

#### Staff Stateroom L

This room is dark. Activating the wall switch sends a burst of sparks from the smashed ceiling fixtures. The room itself has been stripped of cloth and bedclothes. Cold water covered most of the floor, two centimetres deep at the centre. Checking the sink reveals it clogged with bandages. The faucets are turned on but were overridden by the central computer when the sink basin overflowed.

#### 32. Reception Area

This area is dark except for one light fixture near the lift shaft; the remaining fixtures have been smashed. This large foyer is the initial entry point for visitors arriving by pinnace. The reception area includes a large plaque on the wall, several comfortable lounge chairs and a working computer terminal.

Adjacent to the lift shaft door is a maintenance hatch. It is well hidden by wall panels and will not be noticed unless a light (hand lantern or electric torch) is used.

The wall plaque indicates basic information about the _Calendula_ , including its owner, Scientific Charters. The essential information is presented on the deck plans. Beneath the information is a small bulletin board. Individual letters have been attached, spelling Lysani Laboratories.

#### 33. Staff Stateroom  M

Lights activate once this room is entered. Smashed furniture and spilled shelves indicate a violent struggle. A green screwdriver handle juts from a wall, having been stabbed in with incredible force.

#### Private Lounge

The room is dark but the light switch still works. It contains a table and several comfortable chairs. One wall is a view screen, with inset computer stations along the table. Another wall has shelving and several bound volumes of computer reports.

This room is a meeting room for the scientific staff. The reports document the progress of the [[#Experimentation|combat drug experiments]]. They detail where on the nearby planet the particular plant specimens have been gathered and which specific types have proven useful. They also indicate the precise procedures used to process the plants. If [[Butler Chemicals]] (see [[#Ships's Computer]]) does not have the information, they could consider it valuable.

#### 35. Private Dining Room

This room is well lit. A large, polished table surrounded by chairs dominates the centre of the room. Place settings for a meal are on the table.

#### Galley and Mess Area

The dining area is dark; all but two lighting fixtures have been smashed. Long tables and chairs occupy the centre of the room. The tables at one end (towards [[#37. Kitchen and Storage|the kitchen]]) have been pushed aside but no large barricades have been created. A bloodied and torn jumpsuit lays discarded on the floor.

#### 37. Kitchen and Storage

This area is dark and the lighting fixtures have been smashed. This room is a food preparation area; facilities are available for cooking both large and small meals. To the rear of the room is a large frozen food locker...

Inside, 12 crew members hang dead on hooks. Many are missing limbs. All seem to have been chewed on somewhat. The teeth marks appear human.

#### 38. Second Engineer's Stateroom

A pile of mattresses and blankets occupies one corner of the room, vaguely discernible in the darkness.

## The Spoke

A single spoke extends from the ring to the centre to provide docking for the research pinnace. The lift shaft, a parallel ladder and fuel conduits extend up its length. The top of the spoke forms a docking ring.

### Life Shaft

The lift shaft car is well lit. It is operable and can travel from just below the docking ring to the reception room in just under 30 seconds.

### Parallel Ladder

This shaft is dark but wall switches work. The ladder is entered from the maintenance hatch and extends from the docking ring to the reception room.

### Docking Ring

The docking ring accepts any round cross-section (six metre diameter) craft and positions its exterior hatch adjacent to the ship's exterior hatch. Locking bolts hold the craft in position as the ship moves. Normally, it holds the laboratory ship's research pinnace when it is not travelling elsewhere.

## Ship's Locker

The automatic lights inside the ship's locker are smashed. The shelves have been ransacked; their contents spilled on the floor. No food or weapons remain inside. No one has taken the five electric torches. A thorough search may discover some working items, as determined by the Referee.

## The Fuel Tunnels

Fuel for the Calendula is contained in two ring-shaped tanks beneath the sub-flooring (the deck plan shows a cross-section of the ring and the two fuel tanks). Internal flow baffles automatically separate the tanks into leak-proof sections in the event of a puncture.

At present, only one section under drive pod number one is full. The other sections have been compromised by holes that have been cut through the sub-flooring at the main laboratory (1), the auxiliary laboratory (13) and one of the staff staterooms (24). The small, dark passageways allow quick travel from point-to-point within the ship.

The two fuel tunnels themselves run parallel to each other, joining every 30 metres. Each independent section of fuel tanks joins to the next with flow baffles which are normally open, allowing easy movement from one section to the next. As a result, the tunnels form a simple but effective maze.

The dismembered body of a crewman has been torn apart and scattered throughout the tunnels by the escaped animals.

A maintenance floor hatch near the middle of each ship's quadrant allows access to the fuel tunnels. These hatches are locked and require a maintenance hatch key.

## The Maze

[[#Haris Slocombe|The astrogator]] realised that cutting through the sub-flooring to the fuel tunnels below created an alternate means to access the various parts of the ship. The tunnels emerge at the [[#1. Main Laboratory]], [[#13. Auxiliary Laboratory]], and [[#24. Staff Stateroom E]] . Almost immediately, the other survivors established barricades over the tunnel exits.

Their purpose was not so much to conceal them, but to control their access by others. Even while they slept, the survivors could lie above an exit with a mattress covering the hole, thus protecting themselves from that flank.

The tunnels are designed to accommodate a maintenance worker wearing a vacc suit. Turning around is impossible outside of the junction points. Due to the cramped conditions, melee attacks suffer DM-2. The [[#Escaped Rodents]] are small enough to not be subject to these penalties.

![[DeathS-040.jpg|200]]

## The Research Pinnace

The 40-ton research pinnace is a small craft capable of scavenging fuel, acquiring specimens and running errands to other parts of the system or to world surfaces. The craft has a crew of one and is capable of Thrust 5 acceleration. Its bridge holds two control couches; the second one carries a gunner if the craft is armed. The cargo area carries nine tons of cargo and six passengers.

The pinnace is streamlined and has integrated fuel scoops. Its fuel capacity of 15 tons is more than sufficient for long-range ventures within any system. In addition, these tanks are used to ferry fuel to the laboratory ship.

This is a modified version of the [[TravellerCore#PINNACE|standard pinnace]]. It boasts an increased fuel capacity but reduced cargo and is not as comfortable. Primarily used as a refuelling vessel by ships lacking fuel scoops of their own or those needing to stay where they are.

![[DeathS-043-2.jpg|300]]
[[DeathS-043-2.jpg|Pinnace]]

The Experimental Data

The research computer in the main laboratory lists five experiments being conducted on the Calendula. They are identified by the code numbers 1067, 1077, 1079, 1101 and 1103.

#### 1. 1067. Combat Drug

Location: [[#1. Main Laboratory]]

Standard combat drug used as a control for other tests. This drug is used as a standard against which the other drugs are judged.

![[DeathS-1067.jpg|100]]

#### 2. 1077. Improved Combat Drug A

Location: [[#13. Auxiliary Laboratory]]

Effects of improved combat drug A on small animals: This drug appears to increase STR and END to 15 after 10 minutes but at the cost of DEX -5. There are no undesirable side effects other than a period of fatigue after 30 minutes.

![[DeathS-1077.jpg|100]]

#### 3. 1079. Improved Combat Drug B

Location: [[#13. Auxiliary Laboratory]].

Effects of improved combat drug B on small animals: This drug appears to mimic regular combat drug but produces no ill effects for users when it wears off.

![[DeathS-1079.jpg|100]]

#### 4. 1101. Improved Combat Drug C

Location: [[#1. Main Laboratory]].

Effects of improved combat drug C on small animals: This drug increases STR and DEX by +5 for 30 minutes. There are no side effects.

![[DeathS-1101.jpg|100]]

#### 5. 1103. Improved Combat Drug D

Location: [[#1. Main Laboratory]]

Effects of improved combat drug D on small animals: This drug has no observed effect but 20% of animals used as subjects die after three days.

![[DeathS-1103.jpg|100]]

# Referee Information

If the Travellers miss discovering the initial body outside the ship, they might still notice it floating past a window once they have entered the ship. The sudden appearance of a dead face staring at them from outside might serve as a dramatic shock.

Aboard the station, Travellers may encounter the four surviving crew members or any escaped laboratory animals. Their locations are to be determined by the Referee, as they may be encountered in their lairs or elsewhere in the ship.

## The Survivors

The four surviving crew members scattered to various parts of the ship. Their deranged mental states made survival uppermost in their minds, whilst hunger and fatigue led them to establishing individual lairs. All the while, their intelligence was unimpaired, making them cunning and imaginative.

The flashbacks induced by the drug recur every 12 hours, and last for about one hour. After that period of enhanced characteristics, the individual becomes fatigued for perhaps six hours. Then a five-hour period of normalcy returns, followed by another hour of enhanced characteristics.

### Encountering the Crew

'When the Travellers enter the laboratory ship, one or more of the four surviving crew may be in the enhanced state phase of the drug-induced cycle. To determine this, roll 2D for each crew member. A result of 10+ indicates the crewmember is in their enhanced state. If so, the crewmember should be wandering the ship in search of food or eating a thawed limb of one of the dead crew near the meat locker. Those not in the heightened state phase of the cycle are in their lairs.

Crew members should not remain static once the Travellers board the station. They may hear the Travellers long before encountering them and decide to hide, flee or investigate. Loud noises may trigger their enhanced state. Travellers may enter a lair only to hear the faint shuffling of the resident crew member escaping through the fuel tunnel beneath their feet. Referees should use their best judgement as to what creates the best drama and player experience.

When encountered by the Travellers, surviving crew display suspicion and guarded hostility due to the effects of the drug. While their intelligence remains unaffected (except for [[#Haris Slocombe|the astrogator]]) the mental effects have induced a psychotic paranoia and their intelligence manifests itself more as animal cunning.

It is possible to talk to and reason with the surviving crew but they are extremely sensitive to any implied or perceived threats. Light irritates them and a light shined in their eyes automatically triggers the enhanced strength phase, causing an immediate attack, as does sighting any other surviving crew member.

All of the survivors claim to have subsisted solely off of captured laboratory animals and the galley food stores, claiming that the others have been eating the dead crew (in fact, all four have). All are hungry and respond positively to the offer of rations, if the Travellers have brought any along; and use this hunger as evidence they have refrained from eating the dead crew.

Each are convinced they will be executed for cannibalism if it is discovered. In fact, no legal action would be contemplated given the circumstances but any attempts to convince them of this are perceived as a trick to get them to confess. If a surviving crew member is discovered in the act of eating a dead crew member they attempt to kill all of the Travellers, thus preventing them from reporting his or her actions.

## Confrontations

It is possible to trigger a flashback with a sudden confrontation. When any survivor is encountered, roll 2D. On a 9+ they are immediately triggered to enhanced characteristics. A survivor seeing another survivor causes an automatic flashback. The enhanced, fatigued, normal cycle begins anew from this point.

### The Laboratory Animals

The various animals being experimented upon in the laboratories were also affected by the drugs released into the ventilating system. Many (about 80%) were killed by the effects; their dead bodies eaten over the next few days by the survivors.

Using their enhanced strength, the remaining animals escaped their cages and now roam free in the ship. Most are small rodents operating in swarms. However, two are larger solitary animals.

To determine an animal encounter, roll 2D every 15 minutes.

| 2D| Result|
|2–8| No encounter. Animals might be heard scuttling through walls and vents.|
|9–10| Pack of 4D [[#Escaped Rodents]]|
|11| Enhanced Lycur|
|12| Enhanced Galthin Monkey|

#### Escaped Rodents

![[DeathS-057.jpg|100]]
[[DeathS-057.jpg|Escaped Rodents]]

```
Animal Hits Speed Escaped Rodents 4 6m Skills Athletics 0, Melee (natural) 1, Stealth 1, Survival 1 Attacks Claws/Teeth (D3) Traits Small (-4) Behaviour Grazer, Reducer
```

These represent an assortment of small laboratory mammals that have banded together in hopes of survival. Some appear plump like guinea pigs while others are long and lean like rats. If encountered in a lit area, they flee. If encountered in the dark, on a 2D roll of 7+ they will attack. If they do not attack within two rounds, they flee.

In reality, the escaped rodents are only a minor nuisance. But the possibility of encountering them in the fuel tunnels should deter the Travellers from exploring below too easily.

#### Lycur

![[DeathS-058.jpg|100]]
[[DeathS-058.jpg|Lycur]] Animal Hits Speed Enhanced Lycur 22 10m Skills Athletics (dexterity) 2, Recon 1, Stealth 1 Attacks Bite (2D) Traits Heightened Senses, Small (-1) Behaviour Pouncer

Lycurs are a carnivorous dog-like animal that serves as a popular pet throughout the Solomani Rim. They are also a popular choice of laboratory animal for those wishing to produce drugs suitable for Vargr. Its striped fur alternates between light and dark brown, which blends in well with undergrowth. Lycurs prefer to stalk and ambush their prey.

Normally, Lycurs do not attack human-sized creatures but this aggressive and enhanced specimen is an exception. If possible, it hopes to attack a lone Traveller, dragging the corpse down into the fuel tunnels to devour. But the starving and highly aggressive animal might not wait if the opportunity does not present itself.

#### Enhanced Galthin Monkey

![[DeathS-060.jpg|100]]
[[DeathS-060.jpg|Enhanced Galthin Monkey]] Animal Hits Speed 15 8m Skills Athletics (dexterity) 2, Stealth 2 Attacks Bite (1D+2), Claw (1D+2) Traits Small (-2) Behaviour Omnivore, Gatherer

Resembling a mad scientist's blending of a primate and a spider, the six-limbed Galthin Monkey is an omnivorous mammal native to temperate forests. Their large fore and rear limbs can easily grip branches with remarkable strength. Their smaller, mid-limbs are used for delicate manipulations. Its thick jaw, evolved to open the hard nuts of its homeworld, can easily crush bone. A crescent of black nodes around each of its primary eyes sees infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths, giving it the ability to see in darkness.

Normally, Galthin Monkeys never attack creatures as large as themselves. However, this enhanced specimen certainly will. It primarily moves along ceiling brackets and through air vents too high for other predators, namely the enhanced Lycur, to reach.

### Repairing the Calendula

While currently maintaining pressure and power, the laboratory ship is in bad shape. Damage from the initial explosion, followed by a week of abuse from the surviving crew and animals has left it unable to jump. Providing any animals do not chew through the wiring, the solar array can maintain power indefinitely, as long as ship movement is kept to a minimum for minor corrections. Hull integrity in the auxiliary laboratory will fail in 2D weeks. While iris valves would normally seal to maintain pressure, the breached fuel tunnels throughout the ship cannot prevent atmospheric loss to the areas where entrances have been cut.

The ship currently suffers a Severity 3 critical hit to the fuel, Severity 1 to the hull, Severity 1 to the power plant and requires an Average (8+) Engineer (life support) check (1D hours) to service the life support systems. One ton of spare parts are located in each of the ship's drive pods. Travellers requiring more spare parts to complete the repairs might find them difficult to acquire in such a backwater system.

Once repaired, the Calendula should immediately be taken to a shipyard for a full maintenance overhaul.

Of course, [[Scientific Charters]] and [[Lysani Laboratories]] will do anything in their power to recover their stolen property if the Travellers decide to engage in a little piracy.

## Ending the Adventure

The adventure may end in a variety of ways, usually by the Travellers' own choice in leaving the Calendula :

- If the Travellers' clear the ship of the four surviving crew members (capturing and restraining them), the expedition is successful, and [[#Dalglee Hahsh]] pays as promised.
- If the Travellers' clear the ship by killing some or all of the survivors (capturing and restraining the rest), then the agent expresses disappointment, and wavers a while, but ultimately pays as planned.
- If the Travellers leave without dealing with all four survivors the agent pays half and refuses to provide tickets offworld.
- Attempting to blackmail [[#Dalglee Hahsh]] with evidence of [[Lysani Laboratories]]' illegal sophont testing requires an Average (8+) Advocate check (1Dx10 minutes, EDU or SOC). A success doubles the promised payment. Effect 6+ triples the payment. Attempting to blackmail without solid evidence (laboratory reports, video recording and so forth.) inflicts DM-2 to this check.

Regardless of if they pay, [[Lysani Laboratories]] may take future actions to permanently silence any potential blackmailers or whistle-blowers.

# Characters and Opposition

Both the patron of the mission and the Calendula's surviving crew members are detailed here. Each is shown with original characteristics, drug-enhanced characteristics and fatigued characteristics. Also shown is the location of each crew member's lair.

Short for a [[Bwap]], he has blue-grey skin with yellow stripes, although his 33 years can be seen on his face. Raised on [[Zeng]] in [[Deneb Sector|Deneb]], Dalglee has worked for [[Lysani Laboratories]] for seven years. While most of his contemporaries would find an assignment on a backwater world to be a dead-end position, Dalglee hopes his flawless record and marked improvement in exporting costs will earn him a position at a better world once his two-year assignment ends in 86 days. He understands any problems with the laboratory ship and its research could threaten his aspirations.

Short and stocky with long braided hair, Hollo's high-pitched voice is almost comical. Her front teeth are now chipped and a crooked line of self-administered sutures runs up her right forearm. She constantly fidgets and tugs at her filthy clothes. Born to wealthy parents, she received the finest education and tutors. Graduating with honours, she was quickly hired by [[Lysani Laboratories]], now serving as the lead scientist on this project. It was her decision to perform the illegal sophont testing.

Tall and muscular with short sandy hair with tattoos on her left cheek, her face and hair are now slathered in black grease. Raised as a belter, Pent has a lifetime's experience working on starship engines. She has served on the Calendula for three years. Known for her singing, her performances at crew karaoke nights were always a hit. Now, when not in her enhanced state, she hums to herself to silence the memory of her crewmates' dying screams.

Bald with a thinly trimmed beard, his crew photo shows him with a friendly, almost mischievous smirk. Before the incident, Haris always wore crisp, clean and fashionable clothes. Now he wears armour piecemealed out of whatever he could scavenge. Dried blood cakes his unkempt beard and he is missing a piece of his left ear. The son of two successful businesspeople, Haris was raised with ambitions. He took the advice, ‘Dress for the job you want,' to heart and spent a great deal of effort in maintaining his appearance. Five months ago, he was recruited as a spy for [[Butler Chemicals]] to forward secret [[Lysani Laboratories]] research. The pay was irresistible. It was his idea to use a bomb to sabotage the project. While he feels no guilt about it, the paranoia of his actions being discovered led to heavy drinking. He plans to kill any witnesses to his crimes, scuttle the Calendula and escape.
