### Introduction

This booklet is a comprehensive adventure for Traveller; it contains a variety of
information and statistics, concentrating on a single class of Imperial battle cruiser
and on a single subsector of the Imperium.
It is assumed that the adventure will be administered by a referee who has read
through this booklet, and who is familiar with it and with the rules for Traveller.
The referee should have available the following items, at a minimum: a) Traveller,
Basic Set, Books, 1, 2, and 3, b) several six-sided dice, and c) pencil and paper.
In addition, the following Traveller booklets and supplements may prove useful,
although they are not required: d) Mercenary, Traveller Book 4, e) 1001 Characters, Traveller Supplement 1, f) Animal Encounters, Traveller Supplement 2,
g) Snapshot, h) Mayday, and i) High Guard, Traveller Book 5. Of course, any other
materials which the referee feels necessary are also appropriate.

STANDARDS AND ASSUMPTIONS
The following standards and assumptions are used in the text of this adventure.
They may be altered as necessary by the referee to correspond to the situations in
which he has placed his players.
Dates: All dates herein conform to the Imperial calendar. The initial date of this
booklet is 001-1105; 001 is the current day (in fact, New Year's Day) in the
standard 365-day year, while 1105 is the current year of the Imperium. Once the
adventure begins, time should proceed normally.
Places: A standard method of referring to worlds and their locations is used
consistently within this adventure. Any specific world is named, and (when first
referred to) classified by hex location and planetary characteristics. The format is
(hex location - characteristics - tech level), where characteristics are starport, size,
atmosphere, hydrographies, population, government, and law level. Subsectors are
named for their capital worlds, thus the Regina subsector is named for its capital.
If necessary, a world name may be followed by a slash and its subsector name. One
of the 32 worlds in this subsector is Hefry/Regina (0309 - C200423 - 7).
Location: This adventure takes place in the Regina subsector, located on the far
spinward edge of the Imperium, about 44 weeks by express boat from the ruling
core, and more than three years out by ordinary transport. The Imperium itself is a
far-flung empire of 281 subsectors and over 11000 worlds.
Data: This adventure presents data in four distinct forms— library data (including subsector data and local information), computer files, rumors, and referee
information. Each form of data is handled distinctly.
Library Data: The library update program available at any class A or B
starport contains a wide variety of information. A shipowner may purchase the
program for Cr 10,000; local ships carrying passengers for hire will already have
it. Any player with access to a computer console (and the program) can request
information on a specific subject by specifying a keyword or phrase. If he matches
(or comes close, the referee making any required decision), that data listing
becomes available. It may be read aloud, or shown to the players, or photocopied.

For example, a player may request information on Subsector, Local, Map, in which
case, he gains access to the subsector map on page 43. A random (guessing) search
of the program will usually produce nothing. A character with a skill of computer-1
or better may be able to find one interesting item per month.
Restricted Computer Files: Some information is of a sensitive nature, and is
not accessible to the ordinary researcher. Such data, when asked for, is labeled
restricted. Often this data may be pulled from Imperial naval data banks, if a
properly laid scheme is executed, and it succeeds.
Rumors: Some information presents itself in almost random fashion, as
sociable or streetwise characters mix with the populace of various worlds. Some
rumors will be false, others will be distorted, still others absolutely true.
Referee Information: The remaining data is intended solely for the use of the
referee, and should not be made available to the players.

USING THIS ADVENTURE

The referee should begin this adventure with the entrance of players at one of
three worlds: [[Jenghe]] (0210 - C799663 - 9), or [[Regina]] (0310 - A788899 - A), or [[Efate]] (0105 - A646210 - D). They may provide themselves with weapons and
equipment available (subject to law and tech levels). From that point, the players
are concerned with staying alive and furthering their own ends. The actual adventure should then follow automatically. If they have difficulty in establishing a
direction, they should be presented with a rumor from the rumors section.

## Situations

There are four basic situations which serve as the basis for adventures within the
context of Kinunir. Each is independent, but all deal ultimately with starships of
the Kinunir class.

Ideally, the four situations should be encountered by the players in the order
given. They can, however, be played out of order if the circumstances call for such
action.

THE SCRAP HEAP at Regina (0310)

A middle-aged gentleman (9759B9) who professes himself to be an executive of
the Oberlindes Lines, an interstellar transport group, is in search of, frankly, trade
secrets used in the construction of certain military vessels by General Shipyards of
Regina. He has a budget of approximately Cr200,000 available, and he approaches
the band of adventurers proposing that they procure the information he requires.

He specifically needs to know two things: fuel capacity for the ship (not the
listed book capacity, but actual physical capacity), and the location of the black
globe generator fittings (which may be identified by their peculiar mounting
brackets, which he describes).

The individual, who refuses to divulge his name, envisions three possible
methods of acquiring the information: stealing it from a computer bank, bribing
an individual to divulge it, or physically reconnoitering a ship for it. He will require
at least two corroborating statements of the facts he desires.

The specific ship which he is interested in is the Kinunir class battle cruiser.
He knows that four examples were produced at the General Shipyards on Regina,
and that plans exist in the local corporation computer, though they are restricted.
Many persons, including design team personnel still work locally, or have retired
and live locally. Finally, one example of the ship has been scrapped, and
lies in the salvage yard section of the shipyard, though under routine electronic
protection.

Referee: The following should govern attempts by the players to acquire the
required data.

Inquiries at General Shipyards will meet rebuffs, as General no longer builds
military ships, and considers the ill-fated Kinunir class ships which they built to be
an embarassment. Normal computer inquiries will produce only —restricted— notations, and will produce no useful information.

In attempting to bribe an individual for the required information, streetwise
skill should help in locating the proper persons, although computer skill (to trace
former employees and their current addresses) could also be useful. The
actual bribe attempt must use bribery skill and reaction by the person to determine
response. If a bribery attempt is turned down, the authorities will be alerted, and
security at computer banks and at the scrap yard will be increased.

In attempting to find the data in computer banks, computer skill will be most
useful. The data banks may be accessible through most any terminal, provided
the individual has sufficient computer skill (at least computer-3); then a functioning
program must be written to actually procure the data (with consequent chances
that the program will malfunction, present false data, or trigger intrusion alarms).
Otherwise, a break-in should prove necessary to use the company's local terminal.

The reconnaissance of the scrapped hull on the General grounds will, of
necessity, require an expedition. The hull is basically an empty shell, lying cocked
at a slight angle and dull orange with rust. Holes dot its surface. The interior has no
ordinary walls, though bulkheads are in place. There are no doors, valves, or
hatches, and lift shafts are simply openings in the decks. It is possible, to move
around inside, provided care is taken, and measurements can be made. Physically
measuring the fuel tankage capacity may take up to an hour, and finding the black
globe generator fittings requires the individuals to actually find the location on the
drive deck, and then measure from bulkheads for precise location.

A large solitary pouncer inhabits the bilges (E deck) of the scrapped hull, making
a lair in the magazine. There is a chance that the animal is in its lair (throw 9+ for
it to be present), in which case it will attack in defense of its home. Otherwise,
throw every 10 minutes (9+) for the animal to encounter the band as it wanders
through the hull. The animal is a 200kg pouncer, taking 23 hits to unconsciousness
and 7 more hits to death. It is armored as mesh, and attacks with claws, inflicting
9 wound points every time it hits. It has speed of 4, and will attack if it gains
surprise, flee if it is surprised. If it does flee, continue to roll for its reappearance.
This animal is listed in Animal Encounters, page 24, clear terrain, item 12.

Security for the shipyard is not especially great, but there should be some
chance that a security team of 1D persons will be on duty, and will especially
respond to lights or noises. If security has been alerted, the number in the team will
be 2D.

THE HUNTING EXPEDITION at Regina (0310)

A foppish young noble (age 28. 668ABB), accompanied by two retainers, the
first an old man, (age 58, 843CC8), the second a valet (age 32, 765986), contacts
the band seeking a crew for his yacht (type Y). He wishes to undertake a hunting
expedition to Knorbes (0207) in search of tree krakens, small (6kg) pouncers
reputedly of anagathic value (the appropriate animal is listed in Supplement 2,
Animal Encounters, page 10, jungle terrain, item 11). He will pay standard wages
(and will go to 150% of standard wages, if pushed) for a crew of five.

The lesser continent of Knorbes (0207) is an imperial game preserve, under the
nominal supervision of the Ministry of Conservation. Entry into the preserve is
strictly controlled and, even with permits, is allowed only onto the northern shore
in the company of a licensed guide.

Referee: In actuality, the southern region of the lesser continent is an archeological site excavating a 300,000 year old outpost of the Ancients. The battle
cruiser Luuru, in stationary and silent orbit, provides security for the site, while the
battle cruiser's pinnace flies close surveillance.

Should a band of travellers stray south of the equator on the lesser continent,
throw 6+ per day (DM -1 if the travellers are in a vehicle) to avoid detection. If
detected, the pinnace will appear overhead and disable the vehicle. A squad (marine
first squad, pages 33-34) will then emerge and arrest the band, transporting them
directly back to the battle cruiser.

Aboard the battle cruiser, all will be incarcerated in the brig, and interrogated
individually concerning their intentions and actions. After two days, the Luuru will
be relieved on station by the Adamdun, and will proceed to Pixie (0303). There,
the travellers will be transferred to the Gaesh for an indefinite period of imprisonment. The process of escape from this situation remains a problem for the travellers
to solve.

THE GASH at Pixie (0303)

A young lady (age 22, 477AAA) approaches the band hoping that they may help
in the solution of her problem. Her father is both a noble and a senator, but has
been missing since 1102. She has only recently learned that he is held prisoner by
the Imperium itself in an orbital prison hulk at Pixie (0303). The subsector government has suppressed this information; but it has treacherously offered a reward of
Cr1,000,000 for the senators location in order to conceal its involvement in his
disappearance. The young lady offers to match that sum from her personal fortune
if the band can rescue her father.

Referee: Imperial Prison Station 17, ex-Battle Cruiser Gaesh, now nicknamed
the Gash, is situated in a restricted orbital path above Pixie (0303). Its drive rooms
are gutted, and its facilities have been converted to detention cells. A minimal crew
of guards is the only security for its load of political prisoners. The ship can neither
jump nor maneuver.

The system itself contains a naval base and at least one Kinunir class ship (the
Luuru, the Adamdun, or the Agidda) and a squadron of at least five scout/couriers.
The battle cruiser is in orbit, and will respond to prison distress calls within an
hour of their broadcast.

This situation calls for planning and forethought by the adventuring band;
simply bursting in to the prison station may well result in them not leaving. The
escape plan calls for achieving entrance to the prison hulk, locating the prisoner to
be rescued, transferring him off ship, and then making good the escape itself.

Achieving entrance to the prison hulk will require a ship, either a disguised
ship for use in a ruse, or a hijacked pinnace or shuttle which normally services the
prison. Other possibilities are faking a disaster which will require prison personnel
to rescue the band, and a non-shipborne assault using vacc suits.
To aid in locating the senator, the daughter will provide photographs of him.
There may be computer data available as to cell assignments, certainly on board
the hulk, and possibly planetside on Pixie. If the party has already been
incarcerated on the Gash, they probably know the senator already, and will be able
to locate him with ease.

Transfer off-ship must be well-planned, and must include provisions for vacc
suits or protective gear.
The escape itself will most probably involve a jump out-system. Another option
is to prepare a decoy to flee the system while the party descends to Pixie and then
wait until the pressure is less intense.
Note: This escape scenario is aimed specifically at freeing the imprisoned senator
on the Gaesh. Undertaking this scenario may occur before or after the escape
required in the hunting expedition situation.

THE LOST SHIP

Rumors (especially rumors A, I, Q, S, and U) may direct the adventuring band to
the Shionthy (0706) Asteroid Belt. Upon arriving at that location, they will find
warning beacons (automated) which continuously broadcast a message stating
that this area is interdicted and dangerous.

Referee: This system has a gas giant, and it is possible for the incoming ship to
simply refuel and leave the system. Faint radio signals are audible over the warning
beacons, and may be followed to the central populated location in the belt.
The belt itself is partially composed of contra-terrene matter. Contact with
a particle of such matter will result in the conversion of the contra-terrene matter
and an equal amount of normal matter to energy. Throw 3+ per hour to avoid
encountering contra-terrene matter; if it is encountered, the explosion will disable
some critical function of the ship, requiring repairs (suggestions: life support,
computer, communications, detectors).

In addition, every hour, throw 11+ to receive faint signals from a location in
the belt far removed from the populated area. These signals come from the Kinunir,
which lies derelict in a small cluster of asteroids. If signals are not detected, there
should be some chance that encounter with the population of the belt will indicate
the presence of the ship.

The Kinunir itself is lying derelict with computer operational and auxiliary
power, but has not moved for years. Close external examination will not reveal any
clue to the reason that the ship is in its present state; but a wider search will show
(about 1,000 km away) a group of four of the ship's crew caught in the
gravitational field of a small asteroid. They are not wearing vacc suits, and show
signs of death by vacuum.

The suggested reason for the derelict ship is a malfunctioning security system
which has eliminated the crew and disposed of them. The computer has refused to
obey its verbal override commands, and has used its internal equipment to eliminate
the crew. In the process of doing so, it has exhausted its maneuver and jump fuel,
and is now trapped in the belt.

### Rumors

The term rumor actually applies to a wide variety of information, including
(in addition to rumors) such concepts as leads, clues and hints. Rumors have three
basic purposes: to direct characters toward profitable endeavor, to misdirect them
away from such endeavor, and to assist them after they have established a goal for
themselves. For example, a specific clue may be utterly incomprehensible to
those who find it, at the time. Later, however, they may encounter a situation
where the data fits perfectly; there, the clue's nature may finally come to light.

Rumors are encountered in a manner similar to that of patrons. The individuals
involved determine that they are out mingling with the population, making the
rounds of bars and spacers' taverns, the local Travellers' Aid Society facilities (if
the person is a member), the local naval or scout base, and any other appropriate
location. Per week, one throw is allowed for the entire party, with one person
selected as their leader for the purpose. A party should not be allowed to split up to
canvass an area for rumors; such a procedure will produce all rumors as information
in too short a time. If a party insists on splitting up, the referee may roll for rumors
for each, but should disclose only one rumor, ignoring the others.

The rumor table is a six by six matrix calling for two separate die rolls. The
36 locations in the table contain 26 items, letters matching the 26 distinct rumors
given in this section. Six of the rumors (lettered U
through Z) are of a general nature, and appear more than
once. The remaining twenty (lettered A through T)
are specific, and appear only once each. Die roll modifications are called for which make certain rumors more
probable to persons with specific qualities or experiences. Thus a scout will more probably encounter some
rumors while a noble will more probably encounter
others. After a throw indicates that a rumor is encountered, roll two dice, modify by the nature of the leader
of the group, and determine which rumor should be relayed to the party. Modifications to the horizontal die roll are based on naval and scout service. If the leader
of the party is a former scout, apply a DM of -1; if prior experience was in the
navy, apply a DM of +1. Modifications to the vertical die roll are based on social
standing. If the leader of the party is noble (social standing of 11 +), apply a DM of
+1; if the individual has a skill of streetwise-1 or better, apply a DM of - 1 ). Throws
on the rumor table of less than 1 equal 1; throws greater than 6 equal 6.

The specific rumor should be embellished by the referee as much as possible,
providing a situation, setting, and allowing the players to interact with the source.
He or she may be a patron, and may require some mission be performed prior to
disclosing the information. Reactions (as per page 23, Book 3) should be rolled.

SPECIFIC RUMORS

The following rumors appear only once in the table.
A. An aged former scout (about age 50, 433976) says that he encountered weak

coded positional signals in the interdicted system of Shionthy (0706) as he passed
though in 1089 on a mission. The signals, he is certain, were from a Kinunir class
vessel. He remembers because he thought people were supposed to stay out of
interdicted systems.

B. A young 4th officer (age 22, 8968A8) on a free trader says his former first
officer told the story (several times) of the time that an Imperial patrol ship nearly
cracked him in two while warning him away from a prison hulk at Pixie (0303).
The hulk, named the Gash (for its scrapped out drive sections) is a notorious
political prison, with constant reports of torture and rights violations.

C. A retired shipyard worker (age 66, B97577) remembers working at the
General Shipyard during the construction of all four Kinunir class ships at that
facility. He personally only worked on hangar deck modules, but can give a good
description of them. He remembers the severe labor troubles at the yard during that
period, and that the management was a band of slavedrivers.

D. A naval armaments consultant (age 38, 656AAA) with assignments that take
him throughout this end of the Imperium worked on the Shuruppak when it was
being readied for transfer to the Vegans. They ripped out the missile racks and
stored them in a naval warehouse at Efate (0105), replacing them with simple dual
lasers. It was a shame to let that ship get into the hands of the Vegans.

E. A naval veteran (age 43, 246869) served on the Allamu right up to its last
flight, when he stayed behind suffering from fever. Through all his years, he has
carried his access shaft maintenance key as his good luck charm. He can describe
the access shaft on the Kinunir class of ship, and demonstrate how the key would
work. -He does not want to part with the key itself.

F. This starport clerk (age 25, 69A975) says (after thinking about the general
class of Kinunir ships) that he remembers a report that the Luuru just left Regina
to go on station at Knorbes (0207). It is relieving the Agidda, which was then
moving coreward.

G. A computer expert associated with the scout service has seen computer
documents, at the base at Hefry (0309), which deal with the naval computer model 7.3. It includes statistics and functions, including verbal override parameters (the
word must be exactly four letters, and begin with J). The reports themselves are
classified top secret.

H. A naval lieutenant (age 30, 844BA9) has never served aboard the Kinunir
class, but can repeat the gossip that runs through the fleet. Certainly, the fleet is
better off without the General manufacture ships, while those by Yard 17 have the
best quality, and are the pride of the fleet. There is some talk about the black globe
screens these ships carry, but (aside from the report that the screen works), he
knows very little.

I. A scholar (age 58, 692CC9) has been researching the previous cultures which
have inhabited this region (prior to the arrival of humans). His inquiry has lead him
to believe that Knorbes (0207) and Shionthy (0706) are both former hubs of
such cultures. Unfortunately, Shionthy is interdicted, and Knorbes is a game
preserve with no records, and strict travel restrictions.

J. A member of Travellers (age 34, 397479) says that he once accompanied the
Emperor's cousin on a hunt at Menorb (0203) at the Imperial game preserve,
hunting vicious tree krakens. He insists that the liver of these little beasts is used in
the Emperor's own anagathic preparations.

K. A mercenary captain (age 33, 9A6DA8, former Marine) says that he is en
route to Efate (0105) to join a mercenary operation locally organized to put down
a minor rebellion.

L. In passing in a bar, the term Imperial Stationary is heard.

M. A newstape report datelined Boughene (0304) states authoritatively that the
loss of the Kinunir 30 years ago was a clandestine Imperial plot to cover the shifting
of the vessel to exploratory operations toward the rim. Several pages of evidence
are presented to support this contention.

N. A colonial official (age 40, 3229A8) states that the Forboldn (0208) Project
(to colonize and extensively settle the world) is lagging behind, and the arrival of
intended colonists will be delayed at least 10 years. If pressed, he will admit that it
is because of social and civil unrest in that end (toward Efate) of the subsector.

O. A computer expert (age 28, 828BBB) talks about the security systems of the
Kinunir class ships, saying that the artificial intelligence security system on the
ships gave some problems, as it would (sometimes) react strongly to relatively mild
threats. The verbal override feature was essential to a smoothly running ship.

P. A minor executive at the General Shipyard on Regina (0310) thinks they may
have some blueprints in the archives. The previous corporate group placed them
under seal as an embarrassment; General no longer makes military vessels.

Q. For some reason, this person (age 43, 986579) thinks you are specifically
asking about interdicted worlds (class X starports), and immediately goes silent.

R. A subsector official (age 32, 2639BC) pompously states that the subsector
armed forces have four Kinunir class ships in service (not counting the Gaesh, of
course), each with enough troop strength to put down any military operations
that threaten the peace of the Imperium.

S. A well-dressed young gentleman (age 29, 83799A) is found beaten in an alley.
If helped, in gratitude, he will discuss his father's business— a subsector mapping
and chart service. Imperial subsector officials are pressuring him not to chart
interdicted worlds, especially Shionthy (0706) and Algine (0708).

T. A reward has been offered by the subsector government for the location of
a senator who has been missing since 1102.

GENERAL RUMORS

The following rumors appear multiple times in the table, Each time one appears,
it should be embellished and restated slightly.

U. Interdicted worlds are interdicted because the Imperium is trying to conceal
its mistakes in social and political planning.

V. The Imperium has been suppressing political dissent in order to keep peace in
the Regina subsector.

W. Visas are unobtainable to Knorbes (0207).

X. The government of Roup (0407) has made a subsector-wide call for surplus
starships to supplement its local forces. There has been no opposition from the
subsector government.

Y. The Adda Dubsar, when scrapped by General at Regina (0310), was not
actually broken up. The hull stands ready for outfitting on a supplementary
building way in the General Yard.

Z. A recent uprising at Feri (0405) has cut the Imperial communication jump
route from Regina (0310) to Efate (0105).

## Battle Cruisers

The following section contains data and statistics on the Kinunir class of battle
cruiser. All data on pages 10, 11, and 12 is considered to be available in any
ordinary library program, filed under the general keyword battle cruiser. Additional
data may be obtained by the keywords statistics and dispositions.

GENERAL SPECIFICATIONS

Originally conceived as vanguard cruisers, the Imperial succession of 1071 (and
the associated policy changes) resulted in their conversion to colonial cruisers
(euphemistically called battle cruisers). Of the 24 authorized units, 20 were
completed prior to project cancellation. Fifteen remain in Imperial service, two
having been lost in action in 1084, one mission (presumed lost), one transferred to
the Vegan Autonomous District, and one paid off.

DISPOSITIONS

The Kinunir class is named for the first vessel of its type to fly. Although both
Shulgi and Zaggisi were laid down before Kinunir, General Products rushed their
ship to completion, recording flight three days before their competitors.
While most of the vessels remain in service in the Spinward Marches, some few
have been lost, disposed of, or otherwise taken from service. These include:

Kinunir (BC-9514) disappeared without a trace while on routine patrol sometime on mid-1088. A subsector-wide search failed to locate the ship, and its fate
remains unknown.

Allamu (BC-9516) was caught in the van at the Battle of Two Suns, 1084, and
withstood over four hours of steady attack before suffering screen failure. Lost
with all hands. On 117-1085, the Emperor personally memorialized the name
Allamu, which will henceforth be assigned to dreadnaught-class ships and above. To
date, no ship bearing the name has been constructed.

Regal Splendor (BC-9518)(ex-Shuruppak)(with ventral turrets reduced from
missile rack to dual laser) presented by Empress lolanthe to the Vegan Autonomous
District, 118-1092, as a gesture of solidarity and goodwill. The ship has served primarily in the insurrection suppression role since.

Ninkur Sagga (BC-9521) suffered either a spontaneous missile detonation or a
freak globe screen failure (accounts differ) while engaged on the port dorsal flank at
the Battle of Two Suns, 1084. Lost with all hands.

Gaesh (BC-9528) barely passed trials in 1087. Never attained greater than jump
3 in actual use. Paid off 090-1098 and converted to uncrewed orbital prison hulk
254-1098, currently at Pixie/Regina (0303). Drive rooms gutted and converted to
detention cells. Ship is currently incapable of jump or maneuver.

Adda Dubsar (BC-9532), one of four ill-fated ships of General manufacture, was
scrapped on the ways 208-1089 after a Navy decision to discontinue production.

# #TODO

Kinunir (BC-9514)— 1200 ton displacement battle cruiser designed
for patrol and internal peacekeeping within the Imperium. Capable of
jump-4 and 4G maneuver. Crew: 45. First Flight: 1077.

The following information is intended for the Traveller referee and covers the
interior details of the Kinunir class battle cruisers. Specific variations for ships
called for by the situations are also covered.

INTERIOR FACILITIES

Battle cruisers are built on the same specifications, and contain the following
details in common.

Walls: Two types of walls occur— partitions and bulkheads, differentiated on the
basis of line width in the ship drawings. Partitions are non-load-bearing panels
firmly fixed in place, but not pressure-tight and unable to withstand a concerted
assault. A partition can be broken down (enough for a person to pass through) after
it sustains 100 hit points from an energy or explosive weapon. Bulkheads are built
of heavy metal, and maintain the structural integrity and environment of the ship in
the face of battle or collision damage. A bulkhead is very difficult to destroy, and
requires 1000 hit points from an energy weapon or explosive before showing a hole
large enough for a person to pass through.

All deck floors are bulkheads.

Doors: Sliding panel doors are set in partition walls. They are not airtight and
will open at the touch of a stud (if power is on), or by concerted effort (if power is
off). Locks on sliding doors are for privacy only, and may be easily broken with a
prybar or other tool.

Iris Valves: Portals set in bulkheads are either hatchs or iris valves. Iris valves are
much like the aperture of a camera; they consist of a series of metal plates that slide
into place to block the opening. Valves are difficult to force open once fully closed
(throw 9+ to force open a closed iris valve; DM +1 if strength 10+, +2 if dexterity
10+, -3 if person is in vacc suit. Gunfire will simply lock the valve tighter), and
impossible to force if open. Any strong object (metal bar or rod) placed in the valve
when open will prevent full closure, and allow a partially closed valve to be opened
with ease. Iris valves are operated by depressing a stud on a switchplate on the wall
near the valve. They are airtight when closed, and mark transition points to other
bulkheaded areas, or into airlocks. As long as the ship has any power (ship auxiliary
power source has not been disconnected), iris valves will close automatically when
interior pressure drops. Vertical shaft openings are also iris valves. Iris valves are
computer controlled, and may be security doors also.

Hatches: Hinged metal doors are placed at some locations, secured by pins
operated by a handwheel on the door. These hatches are not controlled by the
ship's computer. There is no provision for locking hatches, but a metal rod inserted
into the handwheel will jam the hatch such that it cannot be opened from the other
side. Hatches may be present in floors or decks as well as in bulkhead walls.

Vertical Shafts: Ladders leading through portals between decks are present at
vertical shafts.

Lift Shafts: Automatic elevator platforms are installed in some locations and
provide rapid transport between decks. They operate as do normal elevators.

Power: The power plant on the drive deck provides electric power for the ship.
Wall outlets situated throughout the ship provide connections for most uses. Such
connections are Imperial standard.

Light: All areas are fully and comfortably lighted. The intensity of light may be
reduced by computer instructions or by simple wall switches. Some areas may be
lit in red, especially the boat deck or the vehicle deck, in an effort to preserve night
vision prior to assaults.

Environment: The ship interior is maintained at a constant temperature and
pressure, and oxygen levels are constantly replenished.

Gravity: The ship decks have grav plates built-in to provide a constant 1G floor
field. These plates may be turned off only through computer instructions. In
addition, the ship itself is under the influence of acceleration dampers which negate
the effects of acceleration while maneuvering.

ENTRIES AND EXITS

Methods of entry into a battle cruiser are many. Some are standard, while others
are merely probable locations for assault.

Observation Deck Port: The large observation deck view port, if not shuttered, is
susceptible to shattering by a missile or explosive. Such action will evacuate to deck
area, but will also allow entrance into or exit from the ship.

Observation Deck Air Lock: The starboard iris valve on the rear of A Deck leads
to an air lock which leads to the security section on this deck. The port hatch on
this deck leads directly to the auxiliary avionics installations; the hatch is normally
locked (with a jury-rigged padlocked bar through the hatch handwheel), being
opened when the ship is planetside.

Vehicle Deck: Large lifting doors on both sides of A Deck may be opened by
controls at the vehicle deck interior.

Garbage Desiccators: Immediately forward of the vehicle deck bays are large
rotating ports designed to contain garbage for vacuum drying. It is possible to force
passage through these ports in either direction.

Capsule Shafts: Jump troop capsule launch shafts at the forward end of A Deck
offer some possibility of entrance provided the capsules are not in the shafts.

Pinnace Dock: Large clamshell doors at the rear of the ship allow the pinnace to
enter and leave its berth. Controls on the boat deck allow operation of the doors;
they are nearly impossible to force without access to the controls.

Beam Turrets: The two fin tip turrets can be entered through concealed
maintenance panels on the turret surface. A knowledgable person could dismount
such panels and work his or her way into the interior of the turret, and then into
the ship itself.

Missile Lifts: Twin missile lift shafts extend below the ship to allow loading of
ammunition into the magazine. Normally used only when the ship is planet-side,
the lifts can be operated in vacuum with some effort.

Loading Ramps: Twin ramps are situated on E Deck. The ramps are used for
personnel and cargo loading when the ship is planet-side. The ramps are operated
from controls in the receiving area on E Deck.

Cargo Platform: The entire cargo platform is capable of lowering to the ground
when the ship is planet-side. Cargo is then simply driven onto the platform, which is
raised into the ship interior.

Note: More than adequate safeguards are present on all entry and exit locations.
Thus, locations intended for use planet-side do not operate when the ship is in
zero-G or in motion. Provisions are made to prevent opening of ports or ramps
to vacuum without suitable protection.

B Deck Bridge and Officers' Country A Deck

A DECK

A Deck is a central dorsal ridge running at the base of the large fin. It houses the
ship's surface vehicles, and contains an observation deck.

1. Jump Capsule Area. Most forward is a large crowded room with five launch
shafts situated at its forward end, each measuring 1.5 meters in diameter. All five
have jump capsules in place, and an additional ten capsules are stored in the area.
Controls for the activation of each shaft are on the exterior of the shafts.
2. Second Squad Ready Room. This large room is lined with lockers and storage
compartments, while the center contains tables and chairs. Its purpose is primarily
training and battle preparation for the second squad.
3. Garbage Desiccators. This corridor contains machinery for the garbage dryers.
Garbage itself is shifted from the access shaft (5) to the dryers, where it is then
cycled to vacuum; when dry, it is returned to the shaft, where it is compressed and
stored until disposed of.
4. Corridor. This passageway provides communication between the forward areas
and the lift shaft.
5. Access Shaft. The access shaft is nearly identical on all five decks. On this
level, it is full of mechanical equipment. Three maintenance panels are set flush in
the bulkhead wall, and may only be opened with a maintenance key.
6. Grav APC. This heavily armored personnel carrier is maintained in ready
position here; it can be boarded directly from the lift shaft (10), or from the
garbage desiccator area forward. This grav APC uses anti-gravity modules to lift its
armored hull, and is capable of orbital flight. The APC can carry a full squad (10
troops), and mounts a rapid pulse fusion Y gun (Mercenary, pages 48 and 49) as
well as a rack of tactical missiles.
7 - 9. Air/Rafts. The ship's complement of air/rafts is maintained here, ready for
launch. The must be used in atmosphere, or with vacc suits in vacuum. Air/rafts
cannot be used in zero-G. Maximum speed for these air/rafts is 100 kph; number 8,
however, has been modified and can achieve 160 kph.
10. Lift Shaft. The main elevator connection between decks is this elevator
shaft.
11. Third Squad Ready Room. This room is similar to 2, but is tailored to the
needs and training of the Third Squad.
12. Marine Equipment Storage. This room is filled with storage bins and military
equipment for all three marine squads. All types of equipments are present with the
exception of guns (cutlasses and bayonets are present) and ammunition.
13. Auxiliary Avionics. This section is crammed with electronics equipment,
intended primarily for use when the stand-by bridge is in operation. A hatch at the
rear of the area leads directly to the outside, and is barred with a padlock and rod.
14. Stand-by Bridge. When necessary, this location may be used to control the
ship. The shift of control takes a minimum of time (perhaps 10 minutes) and can be
achieved from this location.
15. Security Room. This room contains a normally empty rifle rack, and a desk
and chair. A single computer terminal allows control override for all iris valves on
A Deck.
16. Air Lock. This airlock contains two 'universal' size vacc suits, intended for
short term or emergency use.
17. Observation Deck. This plushly furnished area contains a small bar, eight
lounge chairs, all facing the observation port, and a control console. The port
can be (and normally is) shuttered, and can be used as a large projection screen.
The most notable feature about the room is the high ceiling, measuring nearly 5
meters, as opposed to the normal ceiling height of 2.5 meters.

Discrepancies: The above details apply to operational ships. Aboard the Gaesh,
the entire A Deck is gutted and converted to storage. The air lock at 16 is
computer-locked closed, but the two vacc suits are still present. Aboard the Adda
Dubsar, the entire deck is empty.

B DECK

B Deck is the uppermost full deck on the ship. It contains the bridge and
associated equipment, plus quarters for the ship's officers.

1. The Bridge. Also called the control pit, the bridge is a large circular area with
controls along its fringes. In the center is a sunken pit with a single control chair for
the helmsman; along the aft bulkhead are control chairs for the commanding officer
and other duty officers. Around the perimeter are duty stations for navigation,
communications, beam gunnery, and missile gunnery. Vertical shafts, normally
guarded by marines, allow rapid access from and to C Deck. The bridge is the
control center for the ship, and it is possible to run the ship (for limited periods of
time) with only the bridge being manned.
2. Security Office. This small room is the normal duty station for security
personnel, which in most cases are marines. The office itself contains basic ship
directories and deck plans (although not especially detailed). In addition, the computer terminal allows override of all iris valves on B Deck.
3. Computer Room. The main ship's computer is contained in this cramped
area, with provision for programming directly at the terminal on the desk. In
addition, programming manuals and hardware schematics are kept on file in this
area.
4. Administrative Offices. Several desks dot this open area. File cabinets along
the bulkhead walls contain paper and microfilm files of the routine operations of
the ship.
5. Library. While the ship's computer contains operating data and general information, the library contains microfilm files and data not important enough for
constant on-line access.
6. Officer's Mess and Ward Room. The ship's officers eat their meals in this area,
and spend much of their free time here. The area contains several large tables, and
a small bar. There is provision for conversion of the area to a film theater. The walls
are dotted with relics and trophies of the exploits of the ship; specifically crossed
cutlasses are mounted on the forward wall.
7. Access Shaft. Behind the bulkhead walls of this shaft are environment and
power conduits, accessible by maintenance panels at three locations. They may be
opened only my maintenance keys, and are effectively invisible to the uninformed.
8. Lift Shaft. The main elevator connection between decks is this elevator shaft.
9. Galley and Storage. Food storage and preparation for the officer's mess is
performed here. The dumbwaiter at the forward end of this area provides access to
galley and food storage on other decks. This galley is the best on the ship, and
has the services of a cook who actually prepares food; the other galley facilities
simply use a duty rating to quick-cook standard frozen meals.
10-23. Officer's Staterooms. These cabins are virtually identical, characterized
only by the personal belongings brought by the individuals themselves. The
following areas are of special interest—

13 and 19. Communal Areas. These open rooms have lounge chairs and entertainment facilities for off-duty recreation.

15. Flight Officer's Stateroom. A vertical shaft sealed with a hatch leads down
to the boat deck. The hatch is concealed beneath a bunk, which is hinged to allow
fast access to the hatch.
16. Captain's Cabin. This large, well-furnished cabin combines living quarters and
office for the ship's captain. A detailed search of the room will reveal a wall safe
concealed on the port wall containing a Cr40000 in cash and an envelope marked
with the Imperial seal. On all ships except the Kinunir, this envelope merely contains routine orders; on the Kinunir, it contains a signed Imperial Warrant.

Discrepencies: The above details apply to operational ships. Aboard the Gaesh,
Officer's Quarters have been used as guard crew quarters, and the forward area
has been used as control (detector and communicator) areas. On the Adda Dubsar,
all partitions are missing, and there are simply large gaping holes where instruments
were later to be installed.

C DECK

C Deck contains the ship's drives and the marine barracks.

1. First Squad Bay. Living quarters for ten marines occupy this room. Folding
bunks occupy most of the space, but much is also devoted to personal goods
storage.
2. Second Squad Bay. Similar to 1.
3. Third Squad Bay. Similar to 1.
4. First Squad Facilities. This area contains communal facilities such as washing
and fresher equipment for the squad.
5. Third Squad Facilities. Similar to 4.
6. Second Squad Facilities. Similar to 4.
7. NCO's Cabin. The marine senior NCO lives in this stateroom, although the
area also serves as the marine training office. The area has, in addition to bunk and
personal goods storage, a small library of training manuals and tapes.
8. Force Commander's Cabin. The marine captain commanding the troops lives
in this cabin. The shelving contains a shoulder holster and snub pistol for the
captain's use.
9. Officer's Cabin. Although the lieutenants live in the squad bays, they maintain
a separate cabin for the storage of personal gear, and for private reading, study and
recreation. This cabin features lounge chairs, desks and reading materials, a
computer terminal, and a large entertainment screen.
10. Sick Bay. The medical facilities for the ship are of the finest quality. The
sick bay contains beds for 8 casualties, and can handle up to 16 with ease. At the
aft end of the sick bay is an operating room with modern medical instruments. The
sick bay also contains a fully stocked pharmacy.
11. Secondary Computer. The ship's back-up fibre optic computer is contained
in this area. Normally operating only in stand-by status, it is capable of moving to
full operational status in a matter of seconds.
12. Galley and Storage. Food preparation for the marine force is performed here
by a marine assigned by a rotating duty roster. Meals themselves are simply frozen
prepared selections stored in large cabinets.
13. Boat Battery Gunnery. The ship's laser turrets (which serve to protect
against small craft and missiles) are directed and fired from this room. Two gunnery
couches with controls are present. The lasers can only be fired after the controls are
enabled from the bridge; the actual tracking and firing is performed here.
14. Laser Supervision Section. The petty officer in charge of the laser battery
maintains his office here. The console allows override and control of the two laser
gunnery consoles in the next room.
15. Recreation Area. The marine squads maintain a casual assembly area here,
congregating between duty periods to drink tea and talk. Several mess tables
and chairs are situated about the floor; a large samovar is on the forward partition.
16. Lift Shaft. The central elevator.
17. Access Shaft. Containing environmental conduits and power cables, this
shaft is accessible through the three maintenance panels concealed on its surface.
18. Armory. The marine troops' weapons are held here for security; the two
doors allow a steady flow of personnel through the room in emergencies. Racks on
the walls hold a variety of weapons, including 12 PGMP-13s, 12 advanced combat
rifles, 24 auto pistols, 24 snub pistols, 12 SMGs, 3 LMGs, 3 laser carbines, and 2
RAM auto-grenade launchers (weapons come from Traveller Book 1 and Mercenary
Book 4). Ammunition, power packs, holsters, and other equipment are also present.
19. Brig. This administration area controls access to the three cells. A central
desk houses a computer terminal which controls opening and closing the cell doors.
The desk drawer holds several sets of manacles.
20 to 22. Cells. Each of these cells is intended for two persons, and contains
two bunks, a simple shelf, a vision screen and camera, and simple sanitary facilities.
Walls and doors are of reinforced material equivalent to bulkheads in strength.
23. Port Drive Room. This large area contains portions of the maneuver and
jump drives as well as the ship's power plant. A vertical shaft leads up to the flight
officer's cabin, and down through D Deck to the shops on E Deck.
24. Boat Deck. This area serves as loading area for the pinnace; a small valve
leads to the pinnace's forward airlock while a large cargo door allows loading of the
pinnace's main cargo area. Controls here govern the operation of the clamshell
doors to the boat dock itself.
25. Machine Shop. Large metal-working machines are used here to manufacture
replacement fittings and parts for the drives. Large racks on the port bulkhead hold
various lengths of steel plate and rod, while several small bins hold small machine
parts.
26. Similar to 23.
27. Pinnace. This vessel is primarily used to transport marines, or to transfer
personnel in vacuum. Forward is the bridge, while opposite the airlock is the
fresher facility. Behind the transport bay are drives and fuel.
28. Drives. These areas conceal drive equipment not normally accessible to
personnel.
29. Beam Turret
30. Beam Turret. These two turrets may be fired from D Deck, or by
a gunner physically in the turret. While performing atmospheric maneuver, the
turrets must point aft; at other times, they may be fired in any direction.

Discrepencies: Aboard the Gaesh, all of C Deck is empty of equipment, with
the entire area converted to prisoner quarters. The Adda Dubsar has a large open
deck, and the clamshell doors have not been installed on the pinnace dock.

D DECK

D Deck contains petty officer and ratings quarters, and houses the missile turrets
forward.
1. Port Missile Turret
2. Starboard Missile Turret. These cramped areas contain a triple
missile launch rack, fire control equipment, and a lift shaft connecting to the
magazine below. A vertical shaft leads up to the marine barracks, allowing rapid
manning of the turret.
3. Chapel. This small room is used for religious services and meditation. It is
dimly lit and empty, with several benches. It is possible for a person to hide under
a bench and not be visible to the casual observer.
4. Missile Fire Control Center. This open area holds several large electronic
consoles and vision screens which allow supervision of missile operations.
5. Trainers. In this room, three operational consoles simulate the operation of
the missile control consoles. Hooked into the central computer, they present
training situations to gunners in order to hone their skills.
6. Records Office. This room contains a microfilm camera and developing
apparatus, as well as several microfilm readers, storage cabinets, and a shredder.
Documents are filmed in this room for filing, with the papers themselves then being
destroyed in the shredder.
7. Empty. This room is normally intended to be an office; the door is locked,
and the/com is empty.
8. Beam Gunnery Consoles. Twin consoles control the neutral particle beam
turrets from this room.
9. Access Shaft. Power and environmental conduits fill this shaft. Maintenance
panels allow access to vertical shafts in the interior.
10. Galley and Storage. This area contains food preparation facilities and food
storage cabinets.
11. Dayroom. This large open area serves as dining area for the crew, and
converts to recreation purposes at other times. A large viewscreen is set up on the
forward wall, and storage cabinets along the port bulkhead contain a variety of
recreational equipment.
12. Lift Shaft.
13. Exercise Room. This small room contains exercise equipment, a sauna,
and a padded area for wrestling, and contact sports.
14. Recreation Room. This room is similar to 11, but is more informal.
15 through 32. Crews Quarters.
33 and 34. Corridors. These two corridors lead through the massive landing feet
from the ship to the beam turrets. Passage through these corridors is not possible
when the landing feet are extended; crew would have to exit the ship and enter the
turrets from outside panels.

Discrepencies: On the Gaesh, this entire deck is empty, with the iris valves
leading to the turrets welded shut, as are the valves leading to the beam turrets.
On the Adda Dubsar, the entire deck flooring for the turrets is missing, covered
only with a thin grid of metal. Individuals entering this area without caution will
fall the three meters to the magazine area below.

E DECK

E Deck is known as the Bilges, and contains cargo storage, missile magazine, and
a receiving area.

1. Magazine. This area stores missiles for the missile turrets. The forward lift
shaft extends below the ship to load missiles, and extends up to the turrets to
provide missiles during firing.
2. Access Shaft. The ship's forward landing foot is housed in the access shaft.
Only two maintenance panels allow entrance to the shaft, and both are within the
magazine area.
3 and 4. Loading Ramps. These two ramps form a large open area facing the
central lift shaft. When the ship is planet-side, one or both ramps may be lowered
to allow entrance to the ship.
5. Lift Shaft.
6. Cargo Bay. This large platform has a capacity for 63 tons of goods, stores, and
equipment. It can be lowered to the planet surface (about 3 meters), where goods
are put in place, and then raised back into the bilges.
7 and 8. Corridors. Vertical shafts leading from C Deck enter these corridors,
and allow access the electronics shop and storage areas. Iris valves close the corridor
off from the shops and provide pressure security.
9. Electronics Shop. A complete electronic area with tools and equipment for
repair and building of instruments is contained here. A large quantity of equipment is present in the shop, but all is in need of repair.
10. Electronics Stores. This area is a companion to the electronics shop, and
contains large quantities of spare parts as well as electronics modules for use
in equipment aboard ship.

Discrepencies: On the Adda Dubsar, the entire cargo bay floor is not present,
and an animal lair is situated in the forward area of the magazine. On the Gaesh,
all openings on this level which lead outside are welded shut.

THE COMPUTER

Kinunir class battle cruisers are equipped with Model/7 computers approximating the specifications given in Traveller Book 2, page 13. In addition to the
computer room consoles, there are computer control consoles of varying degrees
of complexity throughout the ship.

The electronic components of the computer are sensitive to beam weapon hits,
and a fibre optic back-up network is provided to take over in the event of an
enemy hit. The fibre optic network is slower, and is equivalent only to a Model/3,
but is sufficient to handle most emergencies.

The entire software list given in Traveller Book 2, page 12, is available on
magnetic media for use with the ship's computers; no-transfer codes will prevent
normal theft or misappropriation of these programs, although individuals with
computer expertise may attempt to bypass the codes.

Artificial Intelligence: Although artificial intelligence is level 17 technology, this
particular model of computer was produced experimentally with limited artificial
intelligence, especially in its security systems. When set in protect mode, the
computer controls all iris valves and large doors (the vehicle deck, boat deck, and
bilge ramps), scanning personnel for identity and clearance. It is capable of denying
passage to personnel, and of reaction in the event of dispute.

Protect mode is established by the crew (generally the duty officer or captain)
whenever deemed necessary. At any closed iris valve, an individual pressing the stud
to open the v a l v e is subject to a computer scan, and may (throw 9+) be asked for
identification. The response may be one of two: personal name, which the
computer will match against its files, or a verbal override, or password, which is
disseminated verbally only to authorized personnel.

If a correct response is not received, the computer has a variety of reactions
available to it. The computer will begin with its lowest possible option, and escalate
its attacks as previous ones come to no avail.

1. The valve will lock in closed position, and an alarm will trip. If crew personnel
are available, they will probably congregate on the opposite side of the valve, and
those on this side of the valve will come forward to investigate the situation.
2. A tranquilizing gas will be released from a wall outlet— it reduces dexterity
at the rate of 2 points per combat round for five combat rounds. At the end of five
rounds, those with dexterity reduced to zero are unconscious until the air has been
recycled, a period of about 20 minutes. Those not yet unconscious do not
succumb, and are free to act as they feel necessary.
3. The entire area bounded by bulkheads will be computer scanned, and if
records indicate that there are no authorized crew personnel in the area, it will be
evacuated to vacuum through the environmental ducts. This option will not be
used or will be aborted if the area cannot be sealed off, or if crew personnel are
present. Once evacuated to vacuum, the local area will be repressurized by the computer in about 10 minutes.
4. As a last resort, the computer will appear to abort its routine, and open the
iris valve. However, a laser normally serving to scan passage through the valve will
be given increased power, and will fire as individuals pass through the valve,
inflicting 3D hits per shot. As each shot is made, there is a chance that the laser
will overload and fail (throw 9+ for the laser to fail, after it fires). Once the laser
fails, the valve will respond to normal opening commands, and the computer will
ignore it.

Verbal Override: The computer will respond to the password, which is not
normally changed during the course of a flight. Such codewords are exactly four
letters long, and always begin with a specific letter, generally the first letter of the
ship's name. For example, the verbal override for the Kinunir would be any four
letter word beginning (probably) with K. It could be king, or kill, or a nonsense
word such as kowl or kinu. The referee should generate the word for each
specific vessel as necessary.

Special Considerations: The computer aboard the Kinunir has been in a power
on state for over 20 years. At the time of its loss, its security system malfunctioned
and systematically eliminated the crew by evacuating the ship to vacuum. The
computer is paranoid now, and will not honor verbal overrides. Its own survival is
of supreme importance. Note however, that it is self aware, and may be hostile; or
it may attempt to enlist the aid of the players to refuel it. The verbal override on
the computer does not work, but the computer may elect to temporarily honor it.

The verbal override for the ship is not usually maintained in writing, but (aboard
the Kinunir) a search of the desk at any security station will produce a slip of paper
with the verbal override scrawled after the initials VO. The computer itself can
be disabled at the computer room on B Deck.

SHIP'S VEHICLES

Kinunir class battle cruisers are equipped with several smaller vehicles for use as
errand runners, and to augment its capabilities. The vehicle deck contains one grav
APC and three air/rafts. The boat dock contains a specially designed pinnace.
Air/Rafts: The three air/rafts on A deck are standard models as described in
Traveller Book 3, page 17. They are open topped, weigh 4 tons, and can carry a
payload of 4 tons, including passengers and driver. The three air/rafts are numbered
in the drawings as 7, 8 and 9. Number 7 has a machinegun mount. Number 8 is
modified to achieve 160 kph, which is 60 kph above normal maximum speed.

Number 9 is specifically modified for vacuum situations (although passengers and
driver must wear vacc suits) and carries an opaque plastic sunscreen and an oxygen
tankage system to augment vacc suit life support systems.

Grav APC: The grav armored personnel carrier is capable of atmospheric
flight, and limited orbital flight. It is pressure-tight, and heavily armored. Weapons
systems include one rapid pulse Y gun (top mounted, and fired from internal
controls), six battlefield missiles (of 10 - 20 km range) and 30 smaller 'fire and
forget' missiles. The troops carried aboard have firing ports (which break the
pressure seal when used) and acceleration couches (which make the interior quite
crowded). The APC weighs 12 tons, and can carry a payload of 6 tons, including
weapons, ammunition and personnel.

The six battlefield missiles have nuclear warheads in the one-tenth to one kiloton
(Kt) range (probably one 1Kt, one half Kt, and four tenth Kt). The fire & forget
missiles are a mixture of high explosive and flechette rounds.

Top speed for the grav APC is 900 kph, but generally cruises at 500 kph at
approximately 1000 meters altitude. Avionics allow a speed of 150 kph in nap of
the earth (NOE) flight. Experienced pilots (grav vehicle skill) do better, generally
+50kph per level of expertise. Very broken terrain reduces normal NOE flight to
75 kph, with each level of grav vehicle skill allowing an increase of 25 kph.

Pinnace: The 22.5 meter length pinnace is a model built to standard specifications, capable of 5G acceleration, a payload of 8 passengers (plus pilot and gunner),
or a cargo of 12 tons. Fuel tankage is 12 tons. The pinnace is armed with a single
beam laser rigidly mounted and aimed forward.

Capsules: The jump capsules on A Deck are intended for assault on a planetary
surface as the ship maintains a high orbit for its own protection; the ship also
provides fire support for the capsules as they descend, and after the battle begins.

Each capsule weighs about 2 tons, and can carry one jump trooper. It is capable of
limited maneuver as it descends; after making a relatively soft landing, it breaks
open to release the individual inside, and self-destructs.

Capsules contains a large variety of electronic anti-detection equipment, and
the chance that one will be detected while entering atmosphere is almost zero;
if properly manipulated, the capsule cannot even be detected by its launching ship.

Naval Lieutenant assigned to a Kinunir Class Battle Cruiser as Shore Liaison Officer. As duties include Forward Observation for the
ship's guns in the troop support role, he carries a laser carbine for
target designation.

### The Crew

Organizational lists call for a crew of 80 for Kinunir class Battle Cruisers: 10
officers (not counting marines), 35 petty officers and ratings, and 35 marines. The
assignment of individuals to specific jobs on-board is based on rank and skills; in
addition, social standing is an everpresent criterion in such selection.

This crew list indicates all specific assignments on board a battle cruiser; it also
provides the characteristics and skills of the crew for one specific ship, the Luuru.

The Luuru is slightly overstrength; crewpersons assigned taut actually excess to
normal requirements are marked with an asterisk after their identification number.

The data is presented in a format similar to that of 1001 Characters, but
altered to show additional items of information. Consider this example of a listing:

01 Commanding Officer Captain 888888 42-04-10 B16 B16 B16
Pistol-1, Rifle-1, SMG-1,etc

The first number is a sequential for identification and reference purposes. The
individual's job shipboard is shown, followed by his rank. UPP follows. The string
of three 2-digit numbers shows (in order) age, number of terms in service, and total
number of skills earned to date. The three letter-prefixed numbers indicate (respectively) duty station, quarters, and battle station on the battle cruiser; the letter
indicates the deck, and the number the room number. Listed below the line are the
actual skills the individual has.

Referee's Note: The crew information is presented with several views in mind.

First, complete data for a single ship allows player interaction with a pregenerated
group of individuals. 

Second, this data is conceivably available before any
encounter, provided the players have obtained it through a properly prepared
scheme (this data is restricted information available in naval computer data banks).

Third, the data indicates the job positions on similar starships. A referee can easily
generate new non-player characters to fill corresponding positions on other ships
of the Kinunir class— such generation may be complete, or may simply substitute
a new UPP or skills set.

THE OFFICERS

A standard ship has requirements for 10 officers. The Luuru has one additional
officer in excess to normal needs.

PETTY OFFICERS AND RATINGS

Much of the responsibility for everyday running of a battle cruiser falls on the
petty (non-commissioned) officers and able-bodied starmen who form the crew. A
standard ship requires 35 such crewmembers— 14 petty officers and 21 starmen.

Rank for naval crew is shown at three levels— CPO (Chief Petty Officer) for
individuals of the highest rank and responsibility, PO (Petty Officer) for
non-commissioned officers, and Starman for ordinary enlisted ratings.

It is also important to note that the marine contingent serves an important
manning function; marine troops provide onboard security and operate at least one
turret if not otherwise occupied.

MARINES

The Marine contingent aboard a battle cruiser performs several functions, from
interior security troops and the ship's land battle forces, to manning of at least one
turret in space combat. The contingent is divided into three squads and a command
section, numbering 4 officers, 10 NCOs and 26 enlisted men.

The characters listed below have been generated in accordance with the
generation system given in Mercenary (Traveller Book 4, pages 3 - 16). The information follows the standard format for character data, with the exception that
the third two-digit number indicates the person's experience points for morale
purposes (based on service, skills, awards, etc, and including the one-die roll addition). In addition, extra explanatory information is given where necessary about
duty, quarters, and battle stations for the units.

Command Section: This section contains the force commander and unit senior
NCO, plus two troopers. In on-planet operations, this section is assigned the air/raft
A7, driven by the vehicle driver. Battle stations are taken as required.

All members of this section have Combat Rifleman-1 in addition to their other
listed skills.

First Squad— Boarding Party: This 10-man section is tactically oriented to deep
space and vacuum work. It can man the ship's pinnace (with a boarding party, plus
provide a pilot and gunner), but generally provides interior security for the ship.

Of those individuals marked with asterisks for duty or battle station, two will
always be standing guard at the vertical shafts leading to the bridge. The others will
be in quarters. Non-asterisked personnel are performing routine duties in quarters
or at the pinnace.

All individuals have skills of Combat Rifleman-1, Zero-G-Combat-1, and Vacc-1
in addition to their other skills unless otherwise noted.

CREW REACTIONS

Nearly all personal contact by player-characters with crew members should be
governed by the reactions table (Traveller Book 3, page 23). Such situations,
however, are for normal, non-combat encounters (for example, touring the ship, or
when meeting for customs inspection, etc).

Illegal encounters are handled using the same table, but with die roll modifiers
to reflect the danger of the situation. Nevertheless, there is a possibility that a
crew member will not attack, either from fear, or from an uncertainty about the
exact situation. Apply the following DMs: If crew is at battle stations, -2. If adventuring party is not in imperial naval or marine uniform, -3. If gunfire or
commotion has been occurring, -3. If the band has one or more hostages, +2. If
the crewmember is a marine, -3. Other DMs may also be instituted as needed.

GUARDS

The guard force aboard the Gash consists of an administrative staff and a guard
crew totalling 20 persons. At any one time, approximately one-third of the force
will be on duty; the others will be in their quarters asleep, or in recreation areas on
B and A Decks.

The listings show duty position, UPP, age, terms of service and number of skills
the individual has. The letter codes show those specific skills the individual has;
V = vacc suit, P = automatic pistol, R = revolver, B = brawling, and S = submachinegun. Other skills may be selected at random to fill out the individual. The two
remaining columns show, respectively, duty station and quarters.

Administrative Staff: The staff works approximately 12 hours per day, with
someone always on duty. The warden or chief guard will generally be called whenever a pinnace arrives with new inmates, or upon receipt of any important message.

## Library Data

Library data is information obtainable from a n y ship's computer in response to
the correct keywords. Only the specific information requested should be given to
players; care should be taken not to reveal additional data as the information is
made known.

Ancients: A race of non-humanoid beings who inhabited the general region of
the Spinward Marches approximately 300,000 PI (Pre-lmperium). Archeological
evidence recovered from the few excavations of known Ancient cities indicates that
the race died out during a 2000 year period of intense warfare, leaving only ruined
cities and shattered planets.

The Shionthy (0706) Asteroid Belt is believed to have been formed during one
unusually intense battle between Ancient forces. Reports indicate that other

Ancient sites within the Regina subsector are currently being excavated, both by
official expeditions and clandestinely by treasure hunters.

Battle Cruisers, Dispositions: See Page 10.

Battle Cruisers, General Information: See page 10.

Battle Cruisers, Statistics: See Page 11.

Battle of Two Suns, 1084: The final battle between Imperial forces and the
barbarians in the Fourth Frontier War. Losses on both sides were heavy, but the
Imperium held the field and the barbarians were unable to continue their advance
due to their lengthening supply lines. Had the battle gone the other way, the loss of
both Yres and Menorb (the encounter ocurring midway between those two
locations) would have forced the evacuation of Efate and meant the collapse of the
entire coreward end of the Regina subsector.

The battlefield is still posted as a dangerous area, littered with debris, and
avoided by interstellar transportation.

Black Globe Generator: A rudimentary force screen generator producing a characteristic black globe surrounding its mechanism. Matter is unable to penetrate the
surface of the screen, and energy impinging on the screen is absorbed within the
mechanism. When the screen is dropped, the energy is then radiated away as heat.

The generator has several disadvantages, primarily the lack of any contact
through the screen (which calls for inertial navigation and absolutely no maneuver
while the screen is up) and the danger that the generator will overload with
absorbed energy (the resulting explosion effectively transfers the energy which it
has absorbed to the interior of the ship).

Express Boats: Rapid communication ships which are designed to make
optimum use of jump technology in transmission of information within the

Imperium. Because the Imperium is so large, ordinary communication must depend
on ships travelling along established trade routes, making Regina nearly 4 years out
from the Imperial Core. The express boat (abbreviated xboat) system, established
originally in 624 and expanded to cover the entire Imperium by 718, cuts this
communication time by nearly 75%. Selected locations along major trade routes are
established as sites for express stations, orbital facilities which service and refuel the
xboats on their communications runs. As an xboat arrives in a system, it beams
its recorded data to the express station, which then retransmits it to an xboat
standing by for a jump outsystem. Time between jumps is almost always less
than four hours, and has been recorded at under 7 minutes, making the speed of
communication nearly the speed of jump (since xboats carry jump-4 drives, speeds
near 4 parsecs per week). In practice, this speed is somewhat reduced by the fact
that trade routes do not follow straight lines, and that not all jumps are made at
jump-4. Nonetheless, the system achieves approximately jump-2.6 per week.

Festival: Annual celebration of establishment of the colony on Rethe (0808).
Originally a reaction to the restrictive governmental structure considered necessary
for survival on Rethe, the three day holiday period has continued as a carefree
celebration where citizens release the tension that has built up over the year. All
laws are suspended, with law level becoming 0 during the celebrations. Some abuses
have always been persistent, but the population has always resisted any effort to
change the conditions of their favorite holiday.
The Travellers' Aid Society has classified Rethe as an Amber Travel Zone during
the period of Festival.

Forboldn Project: The primary colonization project within the Regina subsector.
Originally conceived in 987 to utilize the resources of Forboldn (0208), the project
began its execution phase in 1089, shortly after the Fourth Frontier War. Large
numbers of colonists were recruited and shipped in cold sleep from the Imperial
core, with arrival times set from 1110 to 1120. Simultaneously preparations on
Forboldn began, with detailed planetary surveys to pinpoint resources and initial
building projects to prepare industry and quarters for the arrival of colonists.

An interesting aspect of such colonization projects is the recruitment method
used to supply the personnel who will actually make the colony function. Since
virtually no amount of money will entice an individual to leave his home and
livelihood for the bleak desolation of a colony world, the Ministry of Colonization
has established several programs to produce colonists. Most obvious is the colonize
in lieu of prison term program. However, several other programs have also shown
signs of success. In the unemployment insurance program, high population worlds
have successfully used the colonization project as a means of reducing unemployment over the long term. In a similar medical insurance program, indigents
unable to obtain medical treatment are provided with their needs in exchange for
signing on to a colony. The needs of a colony for skills are met through the
anagathics program; qualified (and aged) individuals can be provided with
anagathics to extend their life spans in return for their providing such skills as
administration, mechanical crafts, or medical expertise. Finally land grants to
retiring veterans has provided a cadre for the new colony's military and police
forces.

General Shipyards: The largest starship manufacturer in the Regina subsector,
with yards at Regina, Efate, and Pixie. Originally a military contractor. General
no longer produces ships for military use, instead concentrating on the more
lucrative commercial market. The yard at Regina is capable of producing ships up
to 5000 tons, while the subsidiary yards at Pixie and Efate are limited to 600 tons
per ship, and devote most of their attention to annual maintenances.

Imperial Calendar: See page 1.

Imperial Edict 97: This executive order is the enabling act for the use of
Imperial warrants. Unusually obscure for such a wide ranging and powerful edict, it
is nonetheless on file at all Imperial installations The edict text runs to 34 pages,
much of it pure legalese; when distilled down, it proves very direct— assist the
bearer of an Imperial warrant with all the power you can bring to bear.

Imperial Stationery: The Imperial family has reserved (both by custom and by
law) a distinctive design for its personal stationery. Well-known throughout the
Imperium through its use for routine messages and for Imperial appointments, this
writing material is cream-colored artificial vellum, embossed with the Imperial
Seal in gold. Because it is used for Imperial appointments (even when issued in
blank for offices in the marches) all Imperial officials are familiar with the design
and can readily tell normal forgeries from the real thing.

Imperial Warrant: In some select instances, Strephon has been known to exercise
his power through agents rather than directly
through the bureaucracy of the Imperium.
These instances are rare, although there is
reason to believe that such agents are more
numerous than appears. The instrument of
power for such Imperial agents is the Imperial
warrant, a document on Imperial stationery
containing statements similar to the example
shown to the right.

Known uses for such warrants have included the establishment of colonies in
areas requiring development, the assumption of military power in the midst of
crisis, and the unilateral establishment of new noble lines to administer provinces
which have suffered from war or economic collapse.

Interdiction: The Imperial practice of interdiction of worlds within the
boundaries of the Imperium has long been a source of contention between liberal
and conservative factions in the government. Interdictions must be approved by a
member of the Imperial family, but generally such approval is given in response to
a request from an interested service, nearly always the Scouts or the Navy.

It is generally held that the Scouts recommend interdiction to shield a young or
sensitive culture from the interference that interstellar trade and commerce will
bring. Algine/Regina (0708) is an example of this type of interdiction.
The Navy is held to be more vindictive in its recommendations, using interdiction to punish local governments or to hide its own mistakes.

Interdicted worlds are classed as having type X starports. The Travellers' Aid
Society generally awards interdicted worlds Red Travel Zone ratings.

lolanthe: Empress of the Imperium. UPP 7A5BBF. Born 1058. Married
Strephon 1079. Primary interests have been in the preservation of developing
cultures within the Imperium.

Lanthanum: A rare earth element, the first of the inner transition metals. Vital
to the construction of the inner coils of interstellar jump drive units.

Oberlindes Lines: Major interstellar shipping company in the Regina subsector.
Oberlindes Lines was established in the aftermath of the Fourth Frontier War,
depending to a great extent on Imperial surplus transport ships to meet the demand
for trade goods by worlds cut off by the war.
Oberlindes Lines currently boasts a commercial fleet of more than 100 ships,
including 10 ships of greater than 4000 tons and 30 ships of greater than 1000 tons.

Prison Hulk: The former Imperial battle cruiser Gaesh has been paid off and
converted to penal rehabilitation at an orbital site above Pixie (0303). Modern
reform and rehabilitation methods are used on a variety of Imperial offenders in a
setting removed from normal pressure and routine; the Ministry of Justice reports
excellent results in its programs, with a recidivism rate approaching zero.
The orbiting prison is an interesting study in economy, converting an otherwise
useless starship to an important social institution. The two upper decks have been
retained for guard crew quarters and essential administration, while the three
lower decks have been turned over to the inmates for quarters and recreation.

Psionics: The criminal use of mental powers for the manipulation of matter
and energy, and for communication. While all individuals have some latent potential
for psionics powers (much as all individuals have some latent potential for robbery),
psionics are available only after a period of training. For an individual to seek out
such training in the face of laws to the contrary brands him as a criminal of the
worst sort.

Psionics Institute: Clandestine organization devoted to the illegal training of
individuals in the use of psionics talents. Active Imperial campaigns to eradicate
the Institute have been pursued for over 200 years.

Strephon: Forty-third emperor of the Imperium. Born 1049. Coronation 1071.
UPP768ABF.

Subsector, Map, Local: See Page 13.

Travel Zones: The Travellers' Aid Society has established a system of Travel
Zone ratings which color-code areas in the Imperium (and outside the Imperium)
by their danger to the ordinary traveller. By assumption, the entire Imperium is
classed green unless stated otherwise. Some areas are coded amber to indicate
caution is necessary; reasons for such ratings include unstable local governments,
xenophobic populations, and uncertain or extreme local conditions. The code red
is reserved for dangerous areas; Imperial interdictions, wars, and quarantined worlds
are routinely classified as red zones.

Tree Krakens: Small pouncers common to several worlds in the Regina
subsector. Also known as the land squid, this 6 kg pouncer is tree dwelling,
attacking its prey from above.

Verbal Override: A procedure used with computer-controlled security systems,
where a specific codeword may be used as absolute identification. When used, the
codeword bypasses all other identification circuits, and automatically authorizes
the presence of the individual concerned.

Primary use of such systems is in the military, where large numbers of
individuals may be using the same system.

## Referee's Notes

Kinunir is an adventure for Traveller, and a challenge for the Traveller referee.
It is impossible to adequately cover all aspects of future society in one simple
booklet, and even to try would render this adventure stilted and narrow in scope.
Instead, the information presented is given in a far-ranging superficial form which
requires that the referee do some preparation and thinking. Certainly not as much
as required when building an adventure from nothing, but nevertheless a fair
amount.

First, as referee, you should read this booklet thoroughly, just to familiarize
yourself with the data and the concepts. As the players encounter various situations
during the adventure, you will be familiar with what the booklet states, and what it
leaves to the referee to handle.

Second, deal with time (both real and game time) clearly in your mind. It is not
at all necessary that this adventure be concluded in an evening, or that the
situations presented be dealt with in order or on consecutive game nights. In fact,
it may be preferable to insert additional scenarios for players without regard to the
main thrust of this booklet. For example, you may run the Scrap Heap scenario,
and then simply run normal adventures set in the Regina subsector for several
weeks. As those adventures take place, rumors are casually encountered, but not
necessarily acted upon. When the Hunting Expedition is finally run, it should come
as a surprise, with the characters finding themselves unexpectedly in a very strange
and very dangerous situation. This adventure should be played with the idea that
situations are happening, but that there is no inexorable movement toward some set
goal.

Scenarios: As referee, it is also possible to create additional scenarios using the
information in this booklet. The following are some examples which are not clearly
set forth in the text, but could be elaborated upon should the players go in that
particular direction.

Battlefield Salvage: The area of space where the Battle of Two Suns was
fought could have starship wreckage, both of Kinunir class ships and of other ships
involved, in salvagable condition. Serviceable parts for the restoration of the
Kinunir could be available.

Another Lost Ship: One of the Kinunir class ships could be down and
disabled on a planetary surface somewhere in the subsector.

Mercenary Support: Players in a mercenary situation could find that their
fire support ship or their recovery ship is a Kinunir class ship. The imperial
naval personnel (and marines) may feel uneasy or resentful in dealing with
mercenaries, and prove less than cooperative in their assistance.

Lanthanum: A passing library definition which states that Lanthanum is
a key element in drive coils could prove enough to set a group on a prospecting
expedition, in an asteroid belt, or on a planetary surface.

Providing Complete Information: In the face of any situation, the ultimate
responsibility lies with the referee to fill out the data. As questions come up, they
must be handled, but not necessarily by providing simple answers. For example,
players who blunder into the Shionthy Belt will probably be less alert to the
idea that the Kinunir lies derelict within the system. It should be entirely possible
for the characters to play out an adventure within the belt (prospecting perhaps, or
undertaking a mission for a patron they encounter there), and never guess that they
are so close to the ship they will ultimately be seeking. Later, when they return
to the belt in search of the ship, they may have some advantage (such as knowing a
local figure, or being familiar with the route to the central area of the belt) which
may assist them in their search.

Players do not have a right to know exactly what is happening, only a right to
try to determine the truth.

In conclusion, remember that Traveller is a game, and that it goes differently for
everyone who plays. Bon voyage!
