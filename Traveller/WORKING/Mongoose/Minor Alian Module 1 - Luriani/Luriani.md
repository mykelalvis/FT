# Introduction

Most Imperial citizens have heard of the Luriani. The passionate
Luriani artist who flies into a fit of rage at the slightest offence
is a standard of many holodramas. Likewise the tawdry
bed hopping Luriani hottie favoured in low budget populist
entertainment. Then there’s the ruthless machiavellian painted
and preened Luriani nuntarri manipulating her lover’s political
rivals from period dramas. Recently a new one has emerged in
the action genre, the insane Luriani geneticist developing some
vile bioweapon to exterminate the evil Vilani. There are a few
more positive stereotypes, the hot-shot maverick Luriani pilot,
their uniform an interesting interpretation of dress regulations,
always before the CO for some disciplinary misadventure.
These will engage in an act of heroic self-sacrifice, allowing the
hero to save the day. Also the beleaguered but lovable group
of Luriani parents next door, dealing with their huge brood of
mischievous imps, always ready with cookies or a wise word
featured in family friendly drama. However even here there is
always a negative side, the pilot will blow up at their best friend
the hero at least once and so many adults under one roof, the
implications are often used for humorous effect.

There are exceptions; director Sharik Zhasii’s recent _Disaster
at Gaisaaru_ that brought the long forgotten Luriani War to the
public’s attention, is noted for its sympathetic portrayal of Luriani.

However, the popular image of the Luriani is almost universally
negative - oversexed, emotional and unstable. Most Imperial
citizens can not even say their name correctly and some even
believe they are all women, a misconception formed from their
unusual gender selection mechanism and the preponderance
of female Luriani in popular media. Of course, there is a grain of
truth in most of these stereotypes. The Luriani are passionate,
have a temper, are physically affectionate, and there were (and
still are) nuntarri, though the truth of them is rather mundane.
The Luriani often make excellent pilots, in defence of their
homes they are frequently capable of uncommon valour,
their families are large and they do very much love children.
The only stereotype without some basis in fact is the insane
geneticist. The Luriani’s own experience of genocide have left
them an abiding revulsion at the very idea of mass murder
and bioweapons. It is truly frightening to imagine what would
drive even the most mentally unstable Luriani to contemplate
such a thing. These negative stereotypes are not helped by the
Luriani’s own love of playing up to them with outsiders. The truth
is, these stereotypes are exactly that - stereotypes. The Luriani
are in fact a complex and intriguing culture who have made
some outstanding achievements in arts, music and science.

Usually considered to be a branch of Humaniti and counted
amongst the minor Human races, the Luriani are in fact a
separate species, Homo luriani and as such not normally
interfertile with other branches of Humaniti. The Ancients
transported the Luriani to Daramm in the Ley sector, along with
a number of species of Terran marine mammals approximately
300,000 years ago. Daramm is a world with 95% of its surface
covered by liquid water. There the Ancients modified the
Luriani to suit them to this aquatic environment. Some of these
adaptations are apparent to the casual observer, most are
only found on close examination. Some adaptations such as
their heavy rounded appearance due to a modified fat layers,
webbed hands and feet are visible on close inspection. Others
such as their highly sensitive lines of nerves, increased levels
of haemoglobin, and ability to collapse their lungs only show up
with a detailed physiological examination. Finally some, such
as the radical changes to their brain structure and their three
genders, can only be detected on a biochemical level.

Most know the Luriani love art and music. What most do not
know is billions, if not trillions, born in the Imperium owe their
very existence to ante and neonatal technology developed by
the Luriani and that their skill with reproductive genetics has
made the impossible, children of two separate species, possible.
The Luriani are one of the most misunderstood races in the
Imperium, their popular image a distorted vision of half truths
and contradictions. The word most people who know the Luriani
use to describe them is mostly. They are mostly Human, mostly

My family had decided I should learn about other cultures,
spend sometime experiencing the multitude of variety
in the Imperium. It would fit me for my eventual role as
countess they said. I’d been allowed to pick whomever
I wanted. I found a saying – tomorrow is a long time
coming, so why not enjoy the wait. My parents were
shocked, how could I spend a year amongst a bunch of
loose moraled hot-headed maniacs? I just thought I’d like
to be somewhere where they knew how to have fun. I was
to meet my guide at Daramm Down. She had the rather
unwieldy name of Seshko Kweeri Martin Maval Maval
Iasalanti, a liaison from the LCA. Daramm Down is quite
a place to visit, sculpture and art everywhere, and the
sounds. The music of course, there has to be music. But
also voices, all around you. The Luriani voice is beautiful,
melodic, deep, seductive, rising and falling. Apparently
it’s an accident, the Luriani aren’t meant to have it. The
Luriani can’t talk at all, not really. When the ancients were
tinkering with their brains they took the part that controls
speech and made it do something else. So the Luriani
can’t talk, all they can do is sing.

calm, mostly peaceful, mostly loyal and even only mostly Luriani.
Included amongst them are two subcultures, the Verasti Dtareen
and Mmarislusant, descendants of Humans stranded on Luriani
worlds during the Long Night and for over a thousand years they
have been seeking to make children between them possible.

This book details this poorly understood culture and allows
the creation of characters and adventurers from it. Because
even though the Luriani have been Imperial citizens for
over 900 years, they remain distinctly different from the
Imperial norm. They have a fierce pride in their culture,
seeing themselves as Luriani first and Imperials only
a very poor second. Their loyalty is given not to the
Emperor but their own Archduke and, as the Imperium
recently found, if they are ignored they are more than capable
of making themselves heard or even charting their own course.

BEforE or aftEr?
Unlike the more familiar title name format where the title
precedes the name, Luriani titles almost always follow
the name. Thus the current Luriani Archduke of Gateway
is known as Brandon Archduke not Archduke Brandon.
There are only three exceptions to this rule; the title
Madam used to refer to the matriarch of a Luriani upper
class extended family. The titles Vice Chair and Councillor
used by the Luriani Cultural Association (the chair of the
LCA is the Archduke of Gateway, thus the title is not used).
Finally, the titles Lord Protector, Lord Councillor and Lord
Assemblyman used by the former Luriani Protectorates.
Throughout this book, this format of the title following the
name is used when referring to Luriani characters.

# The Luriani

The Luriani are a race of contradictions. Most outsiders are
struck by the extreme level of politeness in their society and
apparent calm demeanour, only to be shocked by a sudden
outburst of passion. They are a people with no significant
martial tradition that have fought some of the most brutal wars
in history. They are loyal Imperial citizens that suddenly and
seemingly without warning came to the brink of revolt. These
apparent contradictions are the root cause of the Luriani’s
reputation as emotionally unstable and unpredictable. Yet all
these make perfect sense to the Luriani themselves. Indeed,
they are aware of their reputation and seem to take great delight
in playing up to it. There is usually nothing a slightly irritated
Luriani likes more than making a sweeping dramatic exit.

## luriani Physiology

The Luriani are unmistakably of human heritage. However they
are not human, but hominid. The Ancients made substantial
changes to the Luriani’s genome, sufficiently large to move
them to being a new species. These changes were for the
most part to adapt them to an aquatic environment. Luriani
show little difference from most humans on casual inspection.
Their specialised layers of fat cells give them a heavy rounded
appearance and their webbed hands and feet are noticeable,
but otherwise they appear unremarkable. Their height is well
within the human norm (though Luriani females are significantly
taller than the human average of 165cm) but their additional
fat layer and higher quantity of blood do contribute to a slightly
heavier than average weight (approximately 10% heavier than
a Human of the same height).

Closer inspection will reveal a nicotating membrane to protect
their eyes, as well as specialised muscles that can seal ears,
nostrils and collapse their lungs. These modifications allow
them to reach depths of up to 500m at normal atmospheric
pressures without assistance. More subtle are the specialised
fat cells that store oxygen and increased levels of haemoglobin
in their blood. Their body also contains a much higher amount of
blood itself, averaging around 8.3 litres for a healthy adult male.
Also, like some Terran marine mammals, they can dramatically
slow their metabolism and starve non-essential organs of

> [!info]- Excerpt from the Journals of Sara Maval Dame
_She was about my age, probably a little shorter than me,
without the heels that is. Flaming red hair; I’d later find out
red hair is fairly common in the Luriani. Her dress looked
like somebody had taken several paint pots and thrown
them at her. I’d also learn that was normal too. Mind you
once you got past the bright mix of colours, her outfit was
rather stunning, long flowing layers, showing just a little
leg and a lot of back. Those heels were a little alarming
though, must have been a good ten centimetres._

_She smiled. ‘The Lady Sara Elizabeth Lisanii Trace of
Toza, yes?’_

_Her Anglic was unusual, the accent a little odd._

_‘Yes, and you must be Seshko Kweeri Martin Maval Maval
Iasalanti?’ I struggled a little with the pronunciation. ‘That’s
rather a mouthful, what’s it all mean?’_

_She chuckled. ‘Seshko’s my name, it’s short for
Seshyailshishko, it means Sesh’s dearest. Kweeri’s my
birth mother’s name, Martin’s my birth father’s name,
Maval Maval, they’re both family names. Means I’m not
matched or they’d be different, and Iasalanti is my job. But
please, just call me Seshko. May I call you Sara, yes?’_

_I nodded, but she seemed concerned. I then answered
formerly. ‘Yes.’_

_She still seemed concerned, worried she’d offended me
somehow._

_‘If you’d rather I called you something else yes, My Lady
perhaps, yes?’_

_I’d later learn to the Luriani the length of an answer
indicates the degree of enthusiasm._

_‘No, no Sara’s fine.’ She smiled again. They liked smiling.
‘So Seshko, you’re to be my guide?’_

_‘Yes, that’s the general idea.’_

_‘So what’s the most important thing I need to know about
spending a year here?’_

_She laughed, another thing they liked doing. ‘You know
how to dance, yes?’_

blood. These modifications provide the ability to survive in
an environment lacking oxygen for up to an hour. In addition,
they have lines of modified nerve endings that allow them to
detect minute changes in pressure in their surroundings. This
allows them to detect the direction and distance of movement
underwater. These nerve endings also function in air, but with
much less definition. Finally, their skin excretes several natural
oils that protect them from irritants. It is worth noting the same
modifications that allow the Luriani to function underwater also
allow them to survive limited exposure to the vacuum of space.
Here things such as heat loss and radiation are more important,
but a Luriani can survive 20 to 30 minutes in space unprotected.

The most remarkable changes to the Luriani are those in their
biochemistry and brain structure which are only apparent on
the biochemical level. The Luriani brain diverges significantly
from the human norm. Areas usually given over to speech
and language are dedicated to processing additional spatial
information and the speech centres themselves are located in
areas more normally associated with music and singing. The
Luriani are thus naturally at home thinking in three dimensions
and strongly drawn towards music. The Luriani voice is deep
but melodic. They are also overwhelmingly right brain dominant
and thus left-handed. The final change is in their actual
chromosomes. Rather than the usual human norm of X/Y, the
Luriani only posses X chromosomes. Sex determination is
handled by a genetic ‘switch’ that can be either ‘off’ or ‘on.’

Geneticists refer to this as the D/d system. Technically it
produces three genders DD, dd and Dd. DD and dd Luriani are
female, while Dd are male. Despite there being two different
genders of females, there is little difference between DD and
dd women. The only real difference is the DD type tend to be
a little taller on average, though other factors produce a wide
variety between individuals (it is quite possible to have a short
DD or a tall dd woman). There should be an even split between
the two female genders, but a cultural bias has a produced a
split that is closer to 55% to 45% in favour of the taller DD type.
Consequently, there is a tendency amongst Luriani women to
be sensitive about their height.

luriani soCiety
There are two fundamental truths about the Luriani. First, they
are a passionate and emotional people. The modifications
to their brain structure appear to have created a genetic
predisposition towards it and hundreds of thousands of years
of cultural evolution have reinforced this. However, the Luriani
urbanised exceptionally early in their history and tens of
thousands of years of civilisation have lead to elaborate rules
of etiquette and honour to moderate this emotional nature.
The Luriani’s concept of honour is at the heart of their rules
of etiquette and this can best be summed up as; look after
and honour your family, give hospitality to those who ask and

treat those who oppose or disagree with fairness and mercy.
The Luriani are normally extremely polite. They speak softly
and go out of their way to avoid giving offence. Nevertheless,
sometimes their basic nature will break through these layers of
ritual and custom. At that point they will become extremely loud
and demonstrative.

A Luriani in the throws of passion feels their emotions strongly
and will not be shy about showing them. An angry Luriani will
yell and scream, a sad one will cry and wail and an amorous
one will leave the object of their affections in no doubt about it.
However, even then their culture has methods of dealing with
these outbursts. There are numerous ways an angry Luriani
can walk away without losing face. Many Luriani rituals are
designed to give time to allow passions to cool. The ultimate is
the Luriani duel. Despite its name, this does not involve combat.
It is a test of skills and there is no dishonour in losing. It is again
a method of allowing time for tempers to cool. Despite their
nature and occasional outbursts, it is rare for a Luriani to go
beyond what they see as the acceptable limits of behaviour.
When they do, one can expect little restraint from them.

Second, they are also an extremely social people. They enjoy
the company of others and, put bluntly, like to party. Their rules
of etiquette impose an obligation of hospitality for all who ask.
Social gatherings are frequent and always involve music and
dance. It is generally agreed Luriani social events are extremely
enjoyable. Despite their focus on etiquette and politeness, they
are usually relaxed and easy going. Their etiquette gives them
certainty. A Luriani knows what to expect in most situations,
so there is no need to worry or stress about things unduly.
Conversely, when put in a situation where they don’t know what
to expect, their nervous emotional energy will come to the fore.
They will seem to always be in motion, seeking to find friends
and a place where they can again be comfortable. They will still
seem convivial and friendly, but it may appear forced. They are
looking for others to share with to give them certainty again, and
will aggressively engage in conversation and interaction. They
know their own rules of behaviour do not apply and will want to
learn those that do.

The Luriani place great value on physical contact and have
small personal space. They frequently touch, hold, embrace
and kiss one another. The Luriani are certainly not prudish and
much of their art and music is strongly sensual, even erotic.
Their famed dry sense of humour is often subtly ribald, but
outright crudity and graphic pornography are frowned upon
as crass and boorish. The Luriani regard these as robbing the
mystery and spoiling the fun.

Most Luriani are proud of their bodies and like to show them to
the best advantage. Fashion and appearance are important to
them. Luriani clothing is usually sensual and a little revealing.
However it is expected to be appropriate to the situation. The

provocative ‘scanties’ favoured by Luriani youth would not been
seen as correct attire for the Archduke’s birthday ball.

Subcultures
Many people overlook the fact around 35% of those called
Luriani are not in fact racial Luriani at all. These are the Veresti
Dtareen and Mmarislusant, descendants of Terran soldiers and
administrators and Vilani colonists stranded on Luriani worlds
during the Long Night. The Luriani Archdukes have all been
drawn from these two groups (the current Archduke, Brandon
Minomoru is of Verasti Dtareen heritage). These people have
both absorbed much of Luriani culture and are seen both by
themselves and the Luriani as being Luriani. The Verasti
Dtareen are closest to the racial Luriani in temperament.
They have much the same behaviour and mannerisms. They
lack the Luriani’s genetic underpinning of their emotional
nature and consequently it is less extreme, but there is little
real difference between them and the Luriani themselves. The
largest difference between the two is in their preferred choice of
career. The Verasti Dtareen are heavily over represented in the
Domain’s government and the military.

The Mmarislusant, on the other hand, are seemingly very
different from the Luriani. It is often said there is little difference
between the Mmarislusant and mainstream Vilani. Certainly to
the untrained observer that is true. Outwardly, they preserve
much of the culture and manners of the original Ziru Sirka and
other than the use of an archaic dialect of Vilani little appears
separates the two. However over 2,000 years of contact with the
Luriani has radically altered their culture. They follow the same
rules of etiquette and behaviour as the Verasti Dtareen and
Luriani and, like them, are prone to strong emotional outbursts.
They do tend to be more subtle about it and their outbursts
are less demonstrative, but underneath their seeming Vilani
exterior, they are Luriani at heart. Like the Verasti Dtareen, the
Mmarislusant are heavily over represented in administrative
and military careers.

The Verasti Dtareen have been steadily increasing for the
past several hundred years, both in absolute terms and as a
percentage of the Luriani population. This is occurring not only
due to natural growth but also assimilation of other groups.
There has long been a tendency for migrants to Luriani worlds
to be gradually absorbed into the Verasti Dtareen, a process
that is quietly encouraged by the LCA. Currently about 28% of
the Luriani population are Verasti Dtareen.

The Mmarislusant have been steadily declining for the past two
thousand years. When the First Protectorate was formed, the
number of Vilani who would later become the Mmarislusant
significantly outnumbered the Terrans who developed into the
Verasti Dtareen. These Vilani initially feared a backlash from
the Luriani and the early years of the Protectorate were marked
by a large Vilani exodus. Though these fears proved to be

groundless, these proto-Mmarislusant were not considered full
citizens of the Protectorate, their choice of careers restricted,
and opportunities for advancement limited. Therefore many
who remained elected to integrate themselves into the Verasti
Dtareen. Thus when citizenship was finally extended to the
Mmarislusant in –1372 the population balance had shifted
decidedly in favour of the Verasti Dtareen. This did dramatically
slow their decline, but the trend has remained. Over time, the
Mmarislusant are being gradually absorbed into the Verasti
Dtareen. Though their absolute numbers are increasing (along
with the wider Luriani population) the ratio of them in Luriani
society is continuing to fall. In –1372 approximately 13% of the
Luriani were Mmarislusant; this number is now closer to 7%.

202 70.00% 20.00% 10.00%
1105 65.00% 28.00% 7.00%

War and organised violenCe
As a rule, the Luriani dislike violence and have no significant
martial traditions of their own. Defence is handled by a small
trained core of professionals known as the Verasal backed up
by a large volunteer trained militia called the Iadtlu. They have
never developed the concept of a ruling military elite and long
ago abandoned capital punishment. However, as with many
things, there is a contradiction. The Luriani have a, largely
undeserved, reputation as formidable warriors. This stems from
their nearly suicidal fanaticism when defending their homes.

This has its origins in their conquest by the Vilani. It took the
Vilani 35 years to subdue the Luriani in a campaign that verged
on extermination and was followed by an event commonly
known as the Year of Woe, though the Luriani refer to it as
Edtyassos. What occurred following the Luriani’s defeat is
uncertain. Vilani records mention it only vaguely as a purge
and Luriani oral tradition has been filtered through thousands of
years of retelling. The Luriani speak of near total genocide and
destruction. What is known is the Luriani population suffered a
massive drop at this time and the Vilani deliberately destroyed
most of the records and evidence of Luriani history before this
date. As such. it is a unique event, the only instance of the Vilani
purposefully erasing knowledge.

Whatever occurred, the event was extremely traumatic for
the Luriani and continues to have a major influence on their
culture 5,500 years later. The Luriani’s perception of the event
is preserved in song, art and stories. Luriani children learn from
a young age of these horrors and what they firmly believe will
happen if they allow others to control their fate. It has left the
Luriani with an abiding mistrust of large states and the Vilani in

particular. The Luriani word for Vilani (Bilanee) has an auxiliary
meaning of ‘treacherous and untrustworthy.’ The Luriani do not
believe losing their independence might bring extinction, they
believe it is a certainty. This fear is totally irrational, and any
attempt to use logic fails. Any attempt to minimise or dismiss
these fears will bring a very strong and negative response. An
Imperial attempt to intimidate the Luriani through a show of
force sparked the Luriani War, one of the bloodiest and most
brutal of the Pacification Campaigns.

The integration of the Luriani into the Imperium was only
eventually achieved in return for a number of specific guarantees
that their local autonomy would be respected. These include the
right to veto the deployment of Imperial troops on Luriani worlds,
the right to maintain significant military forces with substantial
offensive capability, the right that the Imperium can only apply
the death penalty on Luriani worlds with their approval, and the
formation of the Luriani Cultural Association. The Luriani do not
usually enforce the first two rights, but the latter are regularly
used. The Imperium is normally mindful of Luriani sensibilities
and usually chooses to only deploy forces recruited from the
Luriani on Luriani worlds.

This deep abiding fear extends down to the personal level. A
Luriani will be uncomfortable when not in control of their fate.
They will react to racial Vilani with mistrust (the irrational nature
of these fears can be seen in that this mistrust does not extend
to the clearly Vilani descended Mmarislusant). If a Luriani
encounters a situation they consider to be genocide or even
mass murder, they will be hard pressed to contain their desire
to do something. Most Luriani are aware, at least on some
level, these fears are irrational. They know logically there is no
evidence to support these fears but the fears are now so deeply
ingrained in Luriani culture that few can overcome them.

luriani and the iMPeriuM
The Luriani are usually seen as loyal supporters of the Imperium
by everyone, except the Luriani themselves. They give their
primary allegiance to the Archduke of Gateway in his role as
head of the Luriani Cultural Association. The LCA’s charter is
to ‘preserve the distinctive Luriani legacy’ within the Imperium
and is one of the most important pillars of Luriani culture. Most
of its activities, such as sponsoring cultural events, subsidising
Wurlana (space going descendants of the great raft ships that
used to roam Daramm’s oceans) merchant clans and fostering
better understanding of Luriani society are unremarkable. It also
acts as an advocate for Luriani interests at court, encourages
technological and economic development, and provides
governmental services for Luriani worlds unable or unwilling to
do so themselves.

It is in these latter functions it occasionally causes controversy.
While not an autonomous government, the LCA steers very

close to being one at times. It also organises and supervises
traditional Luriani militias, which gives it considerable military
potential. It is essentially the Luriani’s insurance, not a
government, but could quickly transform into one if desired.
The LCA takes great pains not to cross the line into threatening
the established order and the Imperium generally realises
attempting to limit its activities would likely result in trouble.
The role of Archduke is vital in this respect; the Archduke of
Gateway has, expect for a brief period in the 11th century, been
of Luriani heritage since the appointment of Sirean Archduke
in 96. The Archduke is the ex-officio head of the LCA and they
have always displayed both a solid loyalty to the Imperium and
careful respect for Luriani sensibilities. The potential volatility
of the situation became apparent during the 11th century when
non-Luriani Archdukes attempted to do away with the LCA and
brought the entire Domain of Gateway to the brink of civil war.

seParatisM
During the height of the Luriani Crisis, most Luriani favoured at
least autonomy if not outright independence. With the resolution
of the Crisis, support for separatism quickly fell away but there
remains a small fringe in Luriani society that wish to leave the
Imperium and chart their own course. The vast majority of this tiny
minority restrict their activities to peaceful lobbying and political
agitation. Some occasionally branch into civil disobedience and
protest performance art. The popular Mmarislusant folk singer
Gami Aminii is one of these, his powerful voice an important
factor in keeping a trickle of young supporters flowing to the
cause. The most violent incident thus far was the drenching
of the Imperial Duke of Sanny with paint in 1101 (the culprits
received a six month sentence in an Imperial prison). Both
Luriani and Imperial authorities are content for the moment
to tolerate these incidents, believing a crack down would only
risk creating support for them. However, the Imperium keeps
a watchful eye on such groups, wary of the possibility of them
either going further or falling under the control of more radical
non-Luriani movements.

CourtshiP and FaMilies
Family and children in particular are of central important to Luriani
culture. Luriani will actively seek out romantic companionship
and few do not ultimately form a long term relationship and
become parents. Current Luriani birth rates are high and their
population has shown increasing rate of growth for the last
150 years. The average Luriani family size is well above the
Imperial norm. Most Luriani governments provide substantial
benefits that encourage these large families. The Luriani word
for family (ami) forms the root of most of their words dealing with
groups, organisations and states. Traditional Luriani families
are large, consisting of a number of adults (four or six adults is
most common) and all the associated children. All these adults
are considered equally parents of all children and all children
siblings. A Luriani does not speak of their mother and father,

they speak of mothers and fathers. The adults are usually
monogamous couples, though alignments do change over time
and some latitude is allowed.

Luriani courtship goes through a number of distinct stages. The
first is eeshren (romantic friends) which may be considered
‘dating.’ If successful, this may then move on to a vusis (from
the Luriani phrase vusis fi t’yasa, practice for children, referring
to attempting to create an environment suitable for raising
children). This is a formal relationship much like marriage, but
would be considered scandalous to have a child in one. A vusis
may then move on to a ugain (match). This is again a formal
relationship but one considered suitable for having children.
Finally two or three matched couples will group together to
form a common household or family. However, the Luriani are
a passionate and emotional people. Individuals will sometimes
find themselves romantically attracted to somebody outside of
their formal relationships. Liaisons outside of a Luriani’s formal
relationship are tolerated and not entirely uncommon, partners
in these are referred to as eshal. However the parties to such
liaisons are expected to act discreetly and be open about
matters with their formal partners, illicit affairs are not tolerated
and viewed dimly.

Mmarislusant families traditionally are slightly different in that
they do not traditionally form the larger group families, stopping
at the simple match. However extra relationships outside this
match are far more common amongst Mmarislusant than other
branches of the Luriani, some of which can even become
publicly acknowledged and quite open. Verasti Dtareen on the
other hand normally follow the same lines as the racial Luriani,
though some have always stopped short of a full family (the
current Archduke is amongst these).

![[AMLur-034.jpg|200]]
Mixed raCe FaMilies
It is common for mixed race couples to form an ami with
another mixed race couple to enable procreation. While
the introduction of c chromosome technology has reduced
the need for such families, mixed race couples still
normally prefer this approach as most women can not
carry a crossbreed child without anti-rejection drugs.
It is normal for such mixed race families to
have children both by utilising c chromosome
technology and via more traditional means.
Though such mixed race families are a
long established part of Luriani society, it
is considered extremely impolite to discuss
exactly what they entail. Polite society
always regards a child’s father as being the
partner of the mother and the nature of an
ami relationship makes the point moot as the
adults are all equally parents.

nuntarri
One of the most frequently misrepresented features of
Luiani society, the nuntarri are a staple of Imperial period
dramas. Portrayed as the classic femme fatale, engaged in
cunning intricate political manoeuvring and seducing their
lover’s rivals only to murder them after a night of passion.
The reality of nuntarri is rather more prosaic. They do not
normally spend their entire lives in formal evening wear
and male nuntarri are as common as female. They are no
more or less likely to be involved in political machinations
than anyone else nor do they routinely arm themselves
with poisoned hair combs. A nuntarri is simply a version
of an eshal, differing only in that they have greater public
acknowledgement and permanence.

Nuntarri are a product of social pressures in Luriani
society that sometimes prevent couples forming formal
relationships. They first emerged in the highly stratified
First Protectorate when matches between social classes
were discouraged. They disappeared during the Long
Night as the social structure flattened and social mobility
returned. They resurfaced during the Second Protectorate
with increasing pressures on Mmarislusant to marry true.
This pressure is due to their declining numbers and
Mmarislusant are still discouraged from marrying outside
their group. It is this pressure that maintains the existence
of nuntarri. They are simply a couple that would otherwise
marry but are unable to due to peer disapproval. The
popular image of the nuntarri comes partly from a handful
of individuals who were famous for their machiavellian
politicking and that virtually the only time an individual will
singled out as being a nuntarri is at a formal occasion.

**Matriarchs**
In Luriani society a matriarch is the most senior female member
of an upper class extended family, responsible for encouraging
family members into a suitable match. A family matriarch has
the customary title of Madam and, highly unusual in Luriani
society, this title precedes name rather than following it. These
individuals have at times wielded great influence. During the
First Protectorate, its was almost unheard of to enter a match the
matriarch disapproved of and again in the Second Protectorate
and early Imperial period, the matriarch’s views were again
important. Currently their influence is again increasing. They
are an important factor encouraging Mmarislusant to marry true
and most other upper class Luriani will at least consult with the
matriarch before marrying, though it is unlikely their disapproval
would prevent the match.

The role’s evolution is quite unusual. Despite its Anglic name and
the fact the title prefixes the name, its origins actually lay in the
culture of the Luriani themselves. Prior to the Protectorates, the
Luriani had a tradition of arranged marriage and employment.
These matters fell under the purview of the extended family’s
Giwa and Gilul respectively. During the First Protectorate,
Luriani culture was substantially altered due to the influence of
the Solomani who would become the Verasti Dtareen and these
customs and the roles of Giwa and Gilul fell out of use. However
as this was occurring, upper class Verasti Dtareen themselves
adopted a modified form of the Giwa as Matriarch. This role of
matriarch would later spread to the Mmarislusant and ultimately
back to the racial Luriani themselves. These matriarch’s still
remain, though as noted, their influence is currently limited.

inter Fertility With other huMans
The Luriani are a separate species and normally can not
interbreed with humans, though it is possible for a non-Luriani
X chromosome and a mutated recessive Luriani d chromosome
to form a viable embryo. Approximately 11% of female/d Luriani
carry a pair of mutated d chromosomes, allowing them to
conceive and carry such a child. Always female, these children
are born sterile, normally with severe physical and mental
handicaps. They are called leramiyasin (children of another
family). First emerging during the Vilani occupation, they were
initially seen as evidence of treachery. They and their mothers
were shunned and forced from Luriani society. Most did not
survive to adulthood. With the coming of the Protectorates and
the integration of the Verasti Dtareen and Mmarislusant into
Luriani society, attitudes slowly changed. Gradually, charitable
organisations were formed to care for them and they came to be
seen as tragic victims of nature.

While no couple would deliberately conceive such a child, with
as much as 10% of the Luriani population being mixed race
couples there are still thousands of unintended leramiyasin
births per year. The chance of an at risk couple having such a

child during their lifetime is on the order of 1 in 1,000. Given the
central importance of children and parenting in their culture, it
is a problem the Luriani regard as extremely serious. It was the
introduction of c chromosome technology in 932 finally allowed
Luriani and non-Luriani to conceive healthy children. However,
for reasons not yet fully understood, embryos including a D
chromosome are not viable using this technique. Research into
the problem is continuing. In 1103 Dr Ariaryn Akheeia developed
a method that promises to allow Leramiyasin children to be
corrected in the womb during the first trimester. It is the long
term goal of the LCA to totally eliminate these unfortunate
children.

luriani tiMekeePing
There are three calendars in use in Luriani space. The most
common and one used for most purposes is the normal Imperial
calendar. The Luriani have been members of the Imperium for
900 years and they, like most other Imperial citizens, use it for
virtually all day-to-day purposes. However, there are two other
calendars used by the Luriani. The first is the Protectorate
calendar, introduced in -1454 during the First Protectorate. It
inherits the same 365 day year as the Imperial Calendar from
the Rule of Man. Its start date is based on the foundation of the
Luriani Cultural Region by Empress Juliana in -1932. Unlike the
Imperial Calendar it does not feature a zero year. It remains
in use for all LCA business. The Imperial date 001–
corresponds with the 175th of 3036 in the Protectorate Calendar.

The other calendar is the traditional Luriani calendar. This is
used for the calculation of a number of Luriani holidays and
festivals as well as for Luriani religion. It is based on the orbital
mechanics of Daramm itself. Daramm’s day corresponds almost
exactly with the standard 24 hour period of Terra and Sylea (the
difference amounts to four seconds per 365 days). This 24 hour
day or lil as it is referred to in Standard Luriani is the base unit of
Luriani dating. Originally this was divided into 20 asala (hours)
which were further split into 100 ilur (minutes) and then 100
lesh (seconds), equivalent to 0.432 standard seconds. These
smaller units were abandoned during the Rule of Man and the
Luriani calendar now uses standard Imperial hours, minutes
and seconds (the very slight difference in the length of day is
handled by inserting a leap minute every fifteen years, the next
being due in 1114).

The larger time keeping units of the Luriani calendar are based
on the orbital period of Daramm. Daramm orbits its central
star Basijk three times every 566 standard days. This forms
the largest base unit, the Edt. This is divided into three yaven
(years) each of 188 days, plus two leap days known as Tyirpel
tlil (fools’ days). The sequence of years are name Iryn, Aira and
Shimmri respectively. Each year is then divided into four iar
(months), each of 47 standard days. These months are named

Bien, Ianyi, Asines and Ane. The traditional Luriani date of 18
Bein Shimmri 3643 corresponds with 001–1105. This calendar
does feature a zero Edt, the Edtyassos.

Perception of Time
Most people outside of the Luriani forget how old their civilisation
is. They do not fit most perceptions of an ancient civilisation.
Nevertheless their culture _is_ ancient. This age and their strong
oral tradition has given the Luriani a different perception of time.
This is most clearly seen in their view of the Edtyassos. For a
civilisation over a hundred thousand years old, five and a half
thousand years is not a long time. This perception is intensified
by the fact they find it difficult to comprehend the Vilani of today
are not the Vilani of the Ziru Sirka. In many ways, the Luriani
as a race are exceptionally patient. They see their long history
stretching behind them and are capable of taking a very long
view. They appear relaxed and easy going because they are
patient. They know the next thousand years will not happen
overnight and rushing will not change that.

Festivals and holidays
The Luriani like holidays and festivals, and have a lot of them.
Most are marked by parties and merriment. The following are
the major Luriani festivals. All these are public holidays on
Luriani worlds. Many other minor festivals also exist, though
most are not public holidays. Never being a race to miss an

opportunity for a festival, the normal Imperial public holidays are
also observed on Luriani worlds.

language
The native tongue of the Luriani is Standard Luriani, an ancient
language dating back to pre-contact times. In addition the
Verasti, Dtareen speak a variant of Anglic known as Luriani
Anglic or Lurglic, while the Mmarislusant retain their language
of Old High Vilani. The LCA expends considerable efforts to
ensure all three languages remain in use, encouraging their
speech in homes and providing full immersion schools. Luriani
characters can be assumed to have native fluency in all three
of these languages. Both Lurglic and Old High Vilani are
sufficiently close to their more common relatives of Anglic and
Vilani that fluency in one will allow accented fluency in the other.

Normally Luriani are softly spoken and their speech patterns
oblique, tending strongly toward metaphor. A Luriani will tend
to speak around a subject rather than to it, frequently using
allegory and allusion. Amongst themselves the Luriani normally
use Standard Luriani as a common language, though they have
a habit of mixing in words and phrases from both other tongues
freely. Therefore understanding Luriani talking amongst
themselves is difficult without fluency in all three. However
since they regard it as the height of rudeness to exclude a
person from conversation, they will prefer to use Lurglic or Old
High Vilani in the company of others.

Festival Explanation
Vatyirpel lil Smallest Fools’ Day: This marks the end of an Edt. It is marked by reflection on the losses of the
Edtyassos. This is usually an extremely sombre affair. Both Fools’ days are the most important Luriani
festivals. It is believed vatyirpel day was once similar to its companion, but is now radically different.
Gityirpel lil Biggest Fools’s Day: This follows vatyirpel lil and marks the start of a new Edt. This is marked by
celebrations of the Luriani’s survival. Unlike vatyirpel lil, this is a celebration and friends frequently
attempt to play practical jokes on one another. Luriani practical jokes are comparatively mild so as not
to cause undue embarrassment.
Tyasa lil Children’s Day: Falls on 7 Ianyi of each yaven. It is a celebration of children. Marked by the giving of
gifts to children.
Ami lil Family Day: Falls on 32 Asines of each yaven. It is meant to be spent in the company of one’s family
and loved ones.
Adiryn lil Art Day: Falls on 26 Ane of Aira each Edt. Marked by cultural and artistic exhibitions.
Aneyaven lil New Year’s Day: Falls on 175 each standard year. Similar in many respects to Giytirpel except there is
no tradition of pranking.
Archduke’s Birthday Currently falls on Brandon Archduke’s birthday of 191 in the standard year. Marked by formal balls and
functions. Descended from the Protectorate holiday of the Lord Protector’s birthday. Originally a Luriani
holiday, now widely celebrated throughout the entire Domain.
Igo Garintylil Iguu Anniversary Day: Falls on 267 each standard year. It marks the Battle of Iguu and the traditional
Luriani day for the remembrance of war dead.
Ralpiamm Garintylil Armistice Anniversary Day: Falls on 347 each standard year. It marks the end of the Luriani War. It
and igo Garintylil are the only Luriani martial festivals. It is marked by military parades and reflection on
the efforts of those who serve in the military.

Standard Luriani is a deceptively easy language for most Anglic
speaker to learn. It uses the same basic subject verb object
sentence structure, the only major difference being everything
relating to either subject or object must be grouped together.
The Anglic question ‘will you dance with me Sara,’ is phrased as
_shi Sara awel shish fa ap ae_ (you Sara wish (to) dance with me
yes). Its verbs are weakly inflected, using conjunctions only for
tense or negation and are virtually exclusively regular. Standard
Luriani is believed to have originated as a trading creole and
has dominated Luriani society for tens of thousands of years.

A few variants of Standard Luriani are found in the scattered
worlds settled by refugees from the Vilani conquest and a
handful of others such as the almost musical Sistena, have
survived, thought mostly to preserve their beauty (Sistena
is best represented in game terms as a form of art skill as it
effectively impossible to understand without the Luriani’s unique
brain structure). In addition, the Luriani/Anglic creole Sesheryn
is encountered in the Empty Quarter sector. However other
than these rare exceptions, Standard Luriani is the language
of Luriani.

Anglic speakers may have a little difficulty with Standard
Luriani’s four form yes/no ( _ae, ia, ma, mee_ ) where a question
may be phrased either affirmatively or negatively ‘you Sara
wish to dance with me yes’ or ‘you Sara wish to dance with
me no’ (note, in this case it is theoretical and the question
itself is redundant, it being extremely impolite to either phrase
an invitation to dance in the negative or refuse one). Anglic
speakers can also struggle with pronunciation. The word _Luriani_
itself is frequently mispronounced (the correct pronunciation is
lur-eye+a-nigh) and the common male name _Jkiadt_ and female
name _Liadtee_ are considered tricky. Its seven forms of negation
is also troublesome, as is its tendency to form new words by
compounding and then shorten them by dropping some or all of
the middle syllables (resulting in words with multiple meanings).

However, the real difficulty lays in both the Luriani’s metaphorical
speech patterns and the relationship of the language to their
rules of etiquette. Standard Luriani contains a substantial
non-verbal component based on etiquette. The true meaning
of a statement is highly dependent on circumstances, body
language and the exact phrasing or response. For example _shi
Sara awel shish fa ap ae_ will normally elicit _ae a awel_ (yes I
wish (to)), but could also elicit _ae_ (indicating another invitation
is unwelcome) or _ae a awel shish fa shi_ (indicating another
invitation is desired). This problem can carry over to a Luriani
speaking another language. It is particularly common in Lurglic
and their use of Old High Vilani. Due to this complexity, Luriani
translation programs have double cost and space requirements
and should always be regarded as unreliable.

generating luriani Words
Luriani syllables are constructed from either a consonant + a
vowel + a consonant (CVC), a consonant + a vowel (CV), a
vowel + a consonant (VC) or simply a vowel (V).

The relative frequency of syllables are CVC: 3, CV: 2, VC: 2 and
V: 2. However, when following a syllable ending in a consonant
the ratio changes to CVC: 1, CV: 1, VC: 2, V: 2.

Standard Luriani’s tendency to form new words by compounding
existing words leads to some extremely long words. However
these are then normally shortened to a manageable length, so
most Luriani words in common use are of six or less syllables.
The frequency of Luriani letters is determined by the table

•	 Verbs are changed into a regular noun by the suffix -ti and
into a proper noun by the suffix -ko. Thus mraiari (to hunt)
gives mraiariti (a hunter) and Mraiariko (the male personal
name Hunter).
•	 Plurals are noted by the prefix t unless the word begins with
t in which case the prefix is d. Thus ie yail , one bed and cee
t’yail , two beds.
•	 Possession is noted by the prefix y unless the word starts
with y in which case i- is used. Thus via listren , my friend
and via y’listren avu , my friend’s house. When compounding
words, both the plural and possessive prefixes are often,
but not always dropped.
•	 Tense is denoted by either the prefix ep- (past) or ef- (future)
or combinations of the two. Standard Luriani has seven
basic tenses (including the unusual past future that places
a future action into the past, used to indicate a cyclic or
repeated action, Anglic speakers frequently have difficulty
with this; it is the equivalent of saying I will sung).
•	 Present: A alar (I sing)
•	 Present perfect: A ep alar (I have sung)
•	 Past: A epalar (I sung)
•	 Past perfect: A epepalar (I had sung)
•	 Future: A efalar (I will sing)
•	 Future perfect: A epefalar (I will have sung)
•	 Past future: A efepalar (I sung and will sing again)
•	 A continuing action is indicated by the use of a copula ( oi,
epoi, epepoi, efoi, epefoi and efepoi ), giving A oi alar (I am
singing), A epoi alar (I have been singing), A epoi epalar (I
was singing), A epoi oi epalar (I had been singing) etc.

on circumstances: _baie-_ (not now), _kammo_ - (not, was not
and will not), _ral-_ (not but should), _map-_ (not but will), _meep-_
(not but was), _elan-_ (is but will not) and _fise-_ (is but was
not). Thus _A oi ralalar_ (I am not singing but I should be).

art, MusiC and Fashion
When most Imperial citizens think of the Luriani’s achievements,
two words will come to mind. First is music and second is art.
The Luriani have excelled in other fields (their achievements
in reproductive biology are particularly notable) but both to the
outsider and the Luriani themselves, their achievements in art
and music are the pinnacle of their civilisation. Luriani art and
music reflect the underlying emotional tension in their society.
Little of it can be characterised as static. Sculptures move,
paintings convey an impression of imminent action, music is
fast and lively, drama focuses on romance and adventure.
Simply put, Luriani art is about movement.

luriani MusiC
If just one art form had to be associated with the Luriani,
it would be music. It was their love of music that ended two
and a half thousand years of occupation and later allowed
Karen Archduchess’s cultural offensive to begin the process
that would lead to their incorporation into the Imperium. The
current (and previous two) director of military music of the
Imperial Corps of Guards comes from the primarily Luriani 2nd
Battalion of the Gateway Regiment of Guards. The head of the
prestigious Imperial Sylean Conservatoire of Music is a Luriani
and they are heavily over represented in its student body. Ora
Raaryn, a Luriani singer currently reaching superstar status
in the Spinward Marches was classically trained there. You
can find Luriani performing, directing, conducting, writing and
administering music throughout the Imperium and beyond.

Luriani music is distinctive and unique. Normally written using
an unusual 10/8 time signature, it takes the form of two triple
and two double beats. The exact arrangement of these beats
depends on the form; the classical mrun uses two triples
followed by two doubles. The vantimm, on the other hand, has
a triple followed by the doubles ending in another triple. The
challenging tulviar migrates the doubles through the triples in
sequence. It is also fast paced and normally written in a major
key, giving it its bright and lively nature. Native pieces slower
than andante are rare, most are allegro or faster and pieces
at presto and are relatively common. Slower music is usually
found in imported forms; the Luriani seem to have a particular
love of the Terran waltz, tango and mariarchi forms. Likewise
the Vilani khisezu, dunamkiikim and igakhisga are popular
with the Luriani. Native Luriani music makes extensive use
of the human voice. It is almost unheard of for Luriani music
not to be accompanied by song. The Luriani voice is naturally
deep and rich, contributing to the strong bass tendencies in

their music. Luriani singing features a secondary voiced note
when inhaling, giving it its distinctive breathy sound. Many non-
Luriani struggle with this feature and it takes some practice to
get correct (mastering Luriani singing is an Art (singing) + END,
Very Difficult (-4), 1-6 days check; the task may be reduced to
difficult (-2) if a tutor is available).

The final factor in Luriani music is that it is meant to be danced
to. Dance is central to their culture. A Luriani social event
without dancing is unheard of and their rules of etiquette
regarding dancing are particularly extensive. Luriani dance
is highly sensual and almost exclusively partnered (they
frequently use dancing alone as a metaphor for death). Body
contact is extremely important, with couples dancing very
closely. Unlike the Terran tradition of male lead, Luriani dance
is lead by the person making the invitation. Its basic steps
are as a waltz on the triple beat and two step on the double.
Therefore most people familiar with standard Imperial dances
can master the basic steps with a little practice (mastering basic
Luriani dance is an Art (dance) + DEX, Routine (+2), 1–6 hours
check). However, some forms, such as the progressive tulviar
are considered formidably difficult to learn (even the Luriani
consider the tulvair a test of a dancer’s skill). The combination
of the powerful nature of Luriani music and the rich seductive
Luriani voice, coupled with the sensual nature of their dance,
creates a combination few can fail to be moved by.

luriani Fashion
The Luriani consider fashion as a form of art and fashion
designers are well respected. Luriani formal fashion is clearly
gender differentiated. Luriani women favour skirts, dresses and
sleeveless designs (frequently matched with long fingerless
gloves). Men prefer trousers, shorts and collarless shirts with
short or slashed sleeves. The average Luriani’s woman’s bust
is little less full than most Humans and female necklines tend
to either be very high or dramatically plunging. Men however
favour a simple V or square. Luriani formal wear, while sensual,
tends to be full and less revealing than might be expected.
Garments are normally designed with the intent of maintaining
an air of mystery. Showing a small amount of skin in a subtle
sensual manner is considered more desirable than a large
amount obliviously. There are exceptions; the ‘scanties’ of
young Luriani are sometimes almost brazen in their revealing
nature and exposed backs are favoured by some.

Luriani fashion frequently features strong primary colours, with
the intent of drawing the eye to areas the wearer wishes to be
regarded and away from those they do not. It is considered
polite and even flattering to pay discreet attention to those
areas. However staring and obvious comments, however
favourable, are normally unwelcome. The Luriani also make
extensive use of make up and body paints, though tattoos and
other permanent markings are uncommon. Both genders show
a preference for shoes over boots in formal footwear, with the
use of heels to add height widespread for women.

Clothes are usually flowing and loose-fitting as their sensitive
lines of nerve endings makes wearing tight or restrictive
garments uncomfortable for extended periods. Items such as
pressure suits whose function requires them to be close fitting
pay particular attention to comfort and are usually tailored to
the individual (increase the cost of such items by 50% to reflect
this). Casual wear follows the same general trends as formal
wear, though gender differentiation is less noticeable. Women
will sometimes wear casual trousers (especially in work areas)
and men light kilts. Generally speaking, Luriani fashion is
distinctive, bold but soft, and sensual as well, intended to show
the wearer to best advantage.

other luriani art ForMs
In addition to music, dance and fashion, the Luriani have excelled
in many other forms of art. Luriani sculpture is particular well
regarded and their dramatic tradition has produced a number of
well regarded actors, writers and directors. Luriani can be found
in a wide variety of other artistic pursuits, though performance
art does predominate.

**Singing Sculpture:** A form of kinaesthetic sculpture. Singing
sculptures are designed to produce soothing and melodic
sounds as air passes through them. The finest examples of
this art form can easily command hundreds of thousands if
not millions of credits. The correct installation of a singing
sculpture is a difficult task, depending on precise alignment and
placement.

**Edtyassos Yashunar:** Translated as the Edtyassos school,
this is not a specific form but more a theme. Works from the
Edtyassos school are produced in a wide variety of forms. It
originally focused on the Edtyassos but it has become a more
generalised style focusing on apocalyptic endings and rebirth.
Artists from the Edtyassos school are considered unstable even
by Luriani standards.

**Kamminlu:** Not a native Luriani art form, kamminlu originated
on ancient Vland. It has long since disappeared from
mainstream Vilani culture and now only exists in Luriani society.
Described as several hours of meaningless poetry set to the
wailing of tortured cats with the performers thrashing around
like deranged octopuses, most people regard kamminlu recitals
as an ordeal and anyone expressing a real liking for them will be
considered eccentric. More than one humorist has suggested
the Vilani lost it for good reason. Despite this perception, the
Luriani as a whole seem to spend an inordinate amount of
time, effort and money to ensure its preservation. Attendance
at kamminlu recitals is almost an obligation for Luriani of high
social standing. Needless to say, kamminlu practitioners take
their art very seriously and do not react well to those who
disparage it.

Rurkiadt: A form of mural, rurkiadt can be found in many
Luriani public buildings. They are abstract and their clashing
discordant mix of colours can make them disturbing to look
at for any period of time. Nonetheless, the often manage to
convey powerful emotional content, they are intended to lead
the viewer into introspection.

Inrela y Garyn: The artists of note. This is a register of famous
and well regarded Luriani artists maintained by the small
Yasvaish y Inrela y Luur (School of artists of Luur) on Luur.
Despite its apparent minor significance, induction into this is
extremely prestigious. It results in an automatic +1 to Social
Standing and a +1 DM on all future attempts to gain employment
in the artist’s chosen field.

Ariaryn Olreel: Acknowledged to be not only one of the
greatest artists produced by the Luriani over the past five
hundred years, but one of the greatest produced by the entire
Imperium. Considered to be part of the Edtyassos school, his
greatest works were produced over a twelve year period before
his suicide in 734. His well known works regularly command
tens if not hundreds of millions of credits at auction and even
a small sketch can fetch hundreds of thousands. The most
famous, Kwu Aaeri (If Only), depicting the Moot spire in flames,
is part of the personal collection of the Emperor on loan to the
Imperial Museum of Art on Capitol. His works are powerfully
moving, and few can view them without feeling some emotion.
These works are also known for the supposed prophetic visions
of the future included in them. Detractors of this theory (which
included virtually the entire respectable artistic, scientific and
historical communities) point out these prophetic visions are
only found retrospectively and it is far more likely he was simply
an extremely gifted but tragically tortured artist. However these
stories do persist, adding to his work’s mystique and value.

religion
Luriani can be found in many of the faiths present in the
Imperium, though the majority still follow their traditional religion,
at least nominally. Not normally regarded as particularly strident
or evangelical in their beliefs, the Luriani nevertheless regard
church as an important focus of community, and services are
well attended. Luriani religion is polytheistic with seven major
deities, 49 minor and a host of lesser spirits and demigods.
Luriani mythology is thought to be an amalgam of a number of
older traditions, its unity a product of the early rise of a world
spanning civilisation on Daramm. Luriani mythology is rich in
interactions between the gods and their followers. Sesh is noted
her frequent interactions and Basijk is supposed to appear to
his followers as an old man bringing inspiration. Virtually all
Luriani regard these as mythic exaggerations and few Luriani
take their faith literally.

male. The -ko suffix often, though far from exclusively, indicates
a personal name.

Traditional Luriani religion has no specific authority in Luriani
society and they have never had a ruling priestly elite.
Nevertheless, clerics are important community leaders,
expected to take a lead in moral and ethical behaviour.
Luriani priests and priestesses are expected to be models of
respectability for their community. They are supposed to marry
and have families. It should be remembered the Luriani concept
of respectability includes knowing when and how to have fun,
and Luriani clerics are expected to take the lead in this as well.
Many community social events are organised and hosted by the
church. The church social is often the highlight of the week in
many smaller Luriani communities.

ChaPlains
One of the curious aspects of Luriani military units is the low
level at which chaplains are attached. Most Luriani military units
of company size or above and most naval vessels (destroyers
and larger) have a chaplain attached to the command structure.
These chaplains can also sometimes be found on larger
mercantile passenger liners. Expected to be familiar with not
just traditional Luriani beliefs but a wide range of religious and
philosophical systems, they see to the spiritual and emotional
well being of the crew and (in the case of mercantile ships)
passengers. These chaplains appear to be an important factor
in the success of the more informal discipline of Luriani units. To
reflect this, all Luriani units and ships should have an additional
position added to their command requirements.

shugilii
The Mmarislusant do participate in traditional Luriani rituals
due to their strong importance to the community, but most of
their spiritual needs are met by their own shugilii. These were
originally the food preparation specialists on ancient Vland.
Vland’s native life’s biochemical basis is radically different from
that of humanity and all food required extensive preparation in
order to make it edible. These shugilii evolved to fulfil the role a
priestly caste would in other cultures. Oddly, Daramm is one of
the worlds where the shugilii’s traditional food preparation role
still has some relevance. Daramm, like the rest of the system, is
extremely rich in heavier elements. This has produced a slight
heavy metal taint throughout the food chain. The Luriani are
adapted to deal with this taint but most of Daramm’s native food
is slightly toxic to humans. While not fatal, this can result in
severe stomach upsets, diarrhoea and vomiting if consumed
in quantity. Therefore, most food on Daramm undergoes
processing before consumption. One consequence of this is
many Luriani consider human food to be bland and tasteless.

suPerstitions
The Luriani hold on to a number of minor superstitions from their
past. These are small harmless beliefs and actions the Luriani
continue to practice. They have little real impact on their daily
lives but the Luriani still feel more comfortable following them.
For example, a Luriani will know disaster will not befall them if
there are at least three at dinner, but they would prefer there
were not. Likewise Luriani pilots regularly say a prayer to Sesh
before embarking on a journey and artists make a dedication
to Aryn before a performance. The lighting of candles for those
at war is particularly common. The Luriani attitude to these
superstitions can best be summed up as ‘it can’t hurt.’

The Church of the Maker
Known as Makerites, followers of this religion can be found
in the regions adjacent to the Luriani. It is noted for its strict
conservative moral code. Makerites are regarded as sober,
honest traditionalists. The faith was quite common at the
founding of the Imperium and though its numbers have declined,
there are still many thriving Makerite communities in both the
Ley and Fornast sectors. There are also a small number of
Makerites within Luriani space. Not regarded as Luriani, they
nevertheless speak the same languages and are noticeably
more liberal in their beliefs than orthodox brethren elsewhere.
The Luriani Makerite community originally migrated into Luriani
space around 700 and are one of the exceptions to the process
of assimilation of non-Luriani. Four hundred years after their
move, they are still there but are slowly being absorbed. Their
numbers have fallen and there are probably less than a million
of them left. The LCA and Luriani Makerite community leaders
have recently been attempting to develop a program that will
encourage the survival of this unique community.

CriMe and laW enForCeMent
For all their passionate nature, the Luriani are generally
law abiding. Their strong focus on community and extensive
rules of etiquette and honour discourage criminal behaviour.
Deliberate and recidivist criminal behaviour is less common
on Luriani worlds, premeditated violent crimes in particular are
significantly lower than the Imperial norm. Nonetheless, there
are Luriani career criminals. Break-ins do happen, and con-
men and fraudsters do exist; most forms of criminal activity can
be found on Luriani worlds. Crimes of passion, on the other
hand, are more common and most frequently where violence
will occur. Luriani are emotional and do lose their temper. Such
crimes are usually dealt with more leniently than deliberate
criminal activity.

Law enforcement is usually handled at a local level. As
with most things, the Luriani like their police close to the
communities they serve, and there is normally at least one
community verasrasti (constable) per 800 individuals. They are
expected to be familiar with the people they police, and tend to
stay on their beat for many years. Verasrasti provide a visible
and approachable police presence in most Luriani communities
and constitute approximately half of all Luriani law enforcement
officers. In addition, there are larger law enforcement stations
to deal with more serious crimes and disorder. Other more
specialist units exist in larger centres and most worlds have a
central investigation bureau to handle the most serious crimes.
In addition to the normal law enforcement services, the Iadtlu is
available to deal with emergencies in the case of either serious
unrest or disaster. There are of course exceptions to these
rules; a number of Luriani worlds do have exceptionally high
law levels due to local circumstances, with far more intensive
policing, but these are the exceptions.

Justice and punishment is handled by trained arbiters, using
an inquisitorial legal system. Both prosecution and defence
are normally handled by state employed advocates. A person
accused of a crime may elect to defend themselves or employ
an independent defence advocate, but must first convince
the arbiter either they are competent to conduct their
defence or there is some compelling reason a state
appointed advocate is inappropriate. However,
arbiters do take a more generous view of the
latter with non-Luriani. Arbiters decide on
both points of law and the facts of a case.
Serious crimes may be judged by a
bench of three to seven arbiters,
with decisions made by majority.
Punishment for crimes takes the

form of fines and restitution for minor offences, with imprisonment
reserved for more serious cases. Premeditated violent crimes
will almost always attract a prison sentence, usually a lengthy
one. The Luriani do not use capital punishment, nor can the
Imperium apply the death penalty on a Luriani world for crimes
against Imperial justice. The Imperium can, however, move a
person facing Imperial criminal charges from a Luriani world
to a non-Luriani one. This would only be attempted in extreme
circumstances for an individual normally resident on a Luriani
world and thus far such circumstance have not arisen, but is
not unheard of for visitors to Luriani worlds facing an Imperial
capital offence to be relocated.

Pickpocketing
The notable exception to the Luriani’s more law abiding nature
is pickpocketing. A few Luriani seem to regard pickpocketing
as the ultimate practical joke and this crime has long been a
problem on Luriani worlds. The situation is not helped by the fact
that Luriani justice tends to regard pickpocketing as a nuisance
level crime and only impose a small fine for those caught.
Unwary visitors will often find their wallets lifted. Fortunately,
an unusual code of honour seems to have evolved regarding
pickpockets. Cash and obvious valuables may be kept, but the
wallet itself and any items of a personal or sentimental nature
should be returned to the owner if possible. There is now even
a special way to fold credit notes to indicate they are specifically
intended for the pickpocket (Cr. 20 is the recommended value).
Many Luriani carry a pre-paid return voucher in their wallets to
facilitate their return. These are widely available and cost no
more than Cr. 2-3. Most respectable hotels now provide them to
visitors as part of their room tariff. If the wallet does not contain
one of these vouchers, the thief will normally drop the wallet into
the local police anonymously.

Osdtee Shiadti Ayular
The OSA (or Special Criminal Intelligence) is a feature of most
local Luriani law enforcement services. Their purview is to watch

for serious threats to order and security. As the name suggests,
they primarily focus on serious organised criminal activity such
as racketeering, narcotics smuggling and the like. However, they
do also watch for terrorist and seditious activity, especially on the
few Luriani worlds with extreme law levels. Each local OSA is
independent though, as law enforcement technically falls under
the Luriani militia system, and theoretically co-ordinated by the
LCA. However, to avoid any Imperial concerns, the LCA usually
passes this over to the Imperial Ministry of Justice. OSA agents
are highly trained, often with Imperial assistance, and regarded
as the elite of Luriani law enforcement. They work closely with
Imperial intelligence services, though normally defer to them in
any case likely to involve Imperial interests. These OSA groups
are also responsible for criminal activity affecting more than one
world, though under the supervision of the Ministry of Justice.

PsioniCs
The Luriani were part of the Imperium during the psionic
suppressions and their attitude towards psionics differs little
from the Imperial norm. If anything, the Luriani are slightly less
favourably inclined towards psionics. Seeking out the ability to
look into someone’s innermost thoughts seems a little perverse
to them. Certainly doing so without express permission would
be more than a little impolite. However, they also regard taking
something that does not belong to you as more than a little

impolite and there are certainly Luriani who do that. So likewise,
there are almost certainly psionic Luriani as well. Before the
suppressions, there was a psionic institute on Daramm, now
long since closed. Nevertheless, it is entirely possible there
are illegal institutes operating on Luriani worlds. The Luriani
themselves appear to have no more or less psionic aptitude
than any other hominid species. However, the radically different
nature of their brain structure makes cross-species telepathy
difficult. Therefore the cost of all telepathic tasks between
Luriani and humans increases by +2 points.

While Luriani are not noticeable more psionic than normal, tens
of thousands of years of urban living, coupled with their emotional
natures have produced a highly empathetic culture. Luriani are
good at picking up what others are feeling. This is not a psionic
ability, more a heightened awareness of body language, subtle
cues in tone and phrasing. To reflect this, Luriani characters
receive a +1 DM on all checks relating to the perception of
another’s emotional state. This heightened awareness is also
at the heart of the Luriani’s seeming remarkable ability to act in
unison in the face of a common threat. The empathetic nature
of Luriani results in a vague sense of sympathy with others’
feelings. When one Luriani feels threatened, more will tend to
feel threatened as well. It is this feeling of sympathy combined
with their strong sense of community that creates their ability to
face a common enemy together.

# History

Much of the records and evidence of early Luriani history was
destroyed following the Vilani occupation in -4547. The Luriani
feel this loss intensely and those who seek to recover this lost
heritage are highly valued. Luriani historians and archaeologists
are both well respected academically and often popular culture
icons among the Luriani themselves.

The Roryniar
Evidence exists that has lead some to believe the Luriani
were not the first sophont species to make Daramm their

> [!info]- Excerpt from the Journals of Sara Maval Dame
I was tired and my feet hurt. I was sitting this one out. Not
that I wasn’t having fun. I was, but in Luriani society it’s
extremely rude to turn down an offer to dance. And, well,
as an exotic Imperial noblewoman, I had a lot of offers.
There were ways to say no, but Seshko had waited well
over an hour before telling me to put my purse on my lap.
She thought it was funny. Then there was turning the glass.
It’s how you flirt; a quarter turn, a half turn, three quarters,
full, each with its own meaning, left like, right dislike. Right
turns were almost unheard of.

Seshko nudged me. ‘Ohhhh, Caaweryn’s getting two drinks
again.’

I looked, and he was. She sniggered slyly. ‘Maybe he’ll turn
it all the way this time.’

I laughed. ‘I’m quite sure my parents would not approve of
a good Makerite girl doing that!’

Her eyes went a little wide ‘You a Makerite, no! Never!’

The Luriani have an odd way of phrasing questions yes and
no. When they said yes at the end, yes meant yes. But if
they said no at the end, then yes meant no.

I nodded. ‘No, I’m a good Makerite girl.’

She giggled mischievously. ‘Oh dear, I think some of your
faith may be tested here.’

I looked over at Caaweryn again, his fine feminine features,
straggly black hair, strong arms. I sighed. She was probably
right.

home. These are referred to as the Roryniar. According to the
various Roryniar theories, a native intelligent race developed
in the system millions of years before the Ancients seeded the
Luriani there. According to these theories this race developed
a substantial technological base and many supposed Roryniar
sites have been found spread throughout the entire system.
Some of the more extreme versions contend this supposed race
developed an extremely advanced technological base, rivalling
even the Ancients. While definitive proof of their existence has
never been uncovered, proponents point to the sheer number
of potential sites as proof. Opponents, on the other hand, point
out it is highly unlikely an advanced technological civilisation
could arise on a water world such as Daramm, or that after
thousands of years some clear proof should have been found.
These opponents ascribe the Roryniar myth (as they call it) to
misinterpretations of ancient Luriani mythology and distortions
of natural phenomena.

Investigations into the Roryniar often focus on the second
habitable world (Verasaryn) orbiting Basijk. Further out than
Daramm, it still supports a complex ecosystem and is generally
considered a more likely site for a native intelligence to have
developed. While the Roryniar are often seen as fringe science,
these theories do have a considerable number of supporters
amongst respected academic circles. However, they tend
to incite considerable controversy and often high passions.
Research into the Roryniar is naturally hampered by the
destruction wrought by the Edtyassos with many vital records
lost in the devastation.

The Reality of the Roryniar
No answer to this mystery is presented here. It is left for
individual referees to come up with something that suits their
own games if they wish. It may well be the Roryniar are nothing
more than shadows of ancient Luriani legends, something
archaeologists will chase but never find. Or they may be real, a
race that evolved and became extinct hundreds of thousands of
years ago. In this case, they developed a modest technological
base and spread through the entire system, perhaps even
beyond using sublight travel. However, the extreme theories
and rumours of super science probably should remain exactly
that; rumours.

Prehistory
Luriani prehistory is not known with any certainty. What is known
is the Luriani civilisation is one of the oldest in charted space.
The Luriani were originally seeded on one of the many island

archipelagos that exist on Daramm and there is clear evidence
they had colonised every part of Daramm by -150,000, indicating
the possession of an advanced level of maritime technology.
The earliest Luriani permanent settlements so far uncovered
appear to date from around this time as well. The earliest cities
date from around -120,000 and by -100,000 a thriving world
spanning trading economy existed.

This curiously early rise of civilisation without agriculture or
metalworking is thought to have been facilitated by two factors.
First is the abundant sea life and lack of seasonal variations on
Daramm, allowing food surpluses and permanent settlements.
The second is the unusually high concentration of heavier
elements throughout the entire system that lad to the evolution
of a number of plants that could produce materials comparable
to metals with minimal treatment. This early rise of urbanisation
is also thought to have had a profound effect on the Luriani.
While cities rose early, the lack of agriculture placed severe
limits on their size, restricting populations to the low thousands.
This is believed to have lead to the Luriani’s strong preference
for informal lines of authority and seeming inability to organise
or tolerate large states.

The Amidaresh
Metalworking and agriculture were eventually achieved around
-28,000 and the Luriani’s development accelerated. When they
were contacted by Vilani influenced traders around -7500 they
had reached a solid TL6. Contact with these traders sparked a
massive technological explosion amongst the Luriani. Though
they had not received the secret of jump drive, they spread
rapidly to the stars using sub-light colonisation ships. By -
the Luriani had a thriving interstellar community of some 30
worlds, connected by the wanderings of their Wurlana sub-light
spaceships. There was no organised Luriani state as such,
just a trading community of independent worlds connected by
a shared culture. This community is usually referred to as the
Amidaresh (family of worlds).

Around -5400, the Luriani finally received jump technology.
Considerable mystery surrounds exactly who gave them and it
is known that it was not the Vilani. Recovered examples of early
Luriani ships exhibit considerable difference from other models
of jump drives in use at the time. Some have claimed the Luriani
are a major race, a claim the Luriani themselves regard as
ridiculous. They state they received jump drives from a race
they call the Seshariti Listren (Travelling Friends) but whom the
Seshariti Listren were is still unknown; many theories exist, but
the most popular focus is a Vilani-influenced minor race.

Edtyassos
The situation began to change with the Vilani Consolidation
Wars. Initially the Vilani viewed the Luriani as unimportant.
Located on the fringes of charted space and nothing more
than a collection of independent worlds, it was thought their

incorporation would be routine and achieved without resort to
violence. It was only that the Luriani possessed a large number
of trading ships which could be turned into an effective fleet that
lead the Vilani to build up forces. It was this build up that created
the very threat the Vilani had sought to avoid. Perceiving danger,
the Luriani unified and prepared for war. The resultant Luriani
Consolidation War was brutal and took the Vilani 35 years to
defeat the Luriani’s fanatic resistance. What followed is possibly
the most pivotal event in Luriani history, the Edtyassos, which
brought the Luriani to the brink of extinction.

The full nature of the Edtyassos has been lost, and even the
reason for it is unknown. It was different from any other Vilani
conquest during the Ziru Sirka. It was not unknown for the
Vilani to attempt to entirely eradicate a ‘troublesome’ race, and
there are a number of instances of this. However, the Ziru Sirka
was fastidious in their preservation of such races history and
knowledge.

The Edtyassos was very different. It appears to have been an
attempt to wipe all traces of the Luriani’s existence from history.
It is also extremely unusual in that the Vilani did not complete
the task. They devastated the Luriani and then stopped. Many
historians have long been baffled by the bizarre nature of these
events. Regardless, the Edtyassos left the Luriani devastated
and traumatised, their history gone, and population ravaged. It
was well over a thousand years before the Luriani population
recovered to pre-conquest levels, a process not helped by the
Luriani’s frequent unrest and outright rebellions against Vilani
rule.

The Truth Behind the Edtyassos
This information is included only for completeness. While
snippets of what befell the Luriani may still exist, it is virtually
impossible that any person in the Third Imperium of 1105 could
ever piece together what actually happened. The Luriani’s
perception of the Edtyassos is a distorted version of what
occurred. Even the Luriani acknowledge the Edtyassos did not
take place in a single year, that the term is a metaphor, but none
realise the whole truth. The Edtyassos was not a single event,
but a series of tragic and horrific circumstances that brought
the Luriani to near extinction, but they are not what the Luriani
now remember them as. These events started with the Seshariti
Listren.

Despite the legends, these were nothing more than a Vilani-
influenced culture, long since gone, that received jump drive
technology. They then gave it to the Luriani and a number of
other races in the region. The Luriani took this drive and their
naturally curious and creative nature led them to alter it, in some
cases improving the technology and in others simply making
changes for what they saw as aesthetic reasons. However,
this investigation of jump drives gave the Luriani a deeper
understanding of the technology than most other recipients.

Prior to their attempts to absorb the Luriani, the Vilani turned
their attention to another group the Seshariti Listren had given
the jump drive to; the Kaski. The Kaski were a militant minor
race in the adjacent Empty Quarter sector and considered a
much greater threat than the Luriani. The Vilani campaign to
absorb Kaski was bungled, the first fleet sent to achieve the
task lost due to incompetence. Eventually, the Vilani defeated
and absorbed the Kaski, but the damage to Vilani prestige had
been heavy. As the Luriani prepared for war, it was decided to
make an example of them. The Vilani would not simply defeat
the Luriani, they would crush them, showing once again the
power of the Ziru Sirka. Unfortunately for the Vilani, early in the
war the Luriani captured an example of Vilani jump-2 drives.
They applied their natural curiosity and copied it. This was
something the Vilani could not ignore. They jealously guarded
their monopoly on these advanced drives and no exception
could be allowed. It was not now just a matter of making an
example; the Luriani possessed something they could not be
permitted to keep.

What followed was the brutal Luriani Consolidation War. Much
of the damage later ascribed to the Edtyassos occurred during
this. Facing fanatical Luriani resistance, the Vilani resorted to
tactics that amounted to a campaign of sterilisation. The cost
of invading and subduing Luriani worlds was judged too high;
therefore they were blasted into oblivion. Orbital bombardment,
nuclear, chemical and crude biological weapons were all
employed to reduce Luriani worlds, one by one. The Luriani
responded with almost suicidal fervour, with small ships
throwing themselves willingly against Vilani battleships in an
effort to extract the highest possible price from the attackers.
Eventually, the Luriani were subdued, their worlds battered into
submission by overwhelming fire power. In -4547, Daramm fell
and the Luriani Consolidation War was won.

This is when what is usually referred to as the Edtyassos
began. With the Luriani worlds secure, the Vilani moved in, not
only to remove the Luriani’s ability to produce jump-2 drives,
but the knowledge to construct them as well. The Vilani were no
more subtle in their efforts to do this than in the conquest. Any
individual, organisation or facility that might hold this knowledge
was simply eliminated. The Vilani never had any intention of
exterminating the Luriani or destroying their history, but that
was the result. In the twenty years following the conquest, the
Luriani’s technology plummeted from TL11 to a low TL5. The
vast majority of Daramm’s population at this time lived in huge
archologies anchored in its shallow seas. The Vilani destroyed
the vital support facilities that maintained these fragile
environments, and the Luriani population that had already been
savaged during the war collapsed. Billions died, some as a
direct result of the Vilani actions but most simply as collateral
damage due to disease and starvation. It is remarkable the
Luriani survived at all and they responded to the disaster
with surprising inventiveness. Methods were developed to

save what they could, and the musical language Sistena was
created at this time as a way to preserve knowledge in secret.
Art, music, literature, anything the Vilani weren’t targeting was
used to preserve fragments of the Luriani’s heritage. Their
highly social culture closed ranks and they clung on as best
they could. Other Luriani fled in an event now called the Luriani
Diaspora. Using sublight Wurlana ships, survivors spread to the
stars and founded small colony worlds far from home. Some of
these worlds still survive, located well beyond the borders of the
Imperium. Most are secretive and paranoid worlds, hiding from
detection, still fearing the wrath of the Ziru Sirka.

Eventually the Vilani purge ran its course, satisfied no trace of
the forbidden technology remained, their monopoly on jump-2
drives again intact. However, this was still not the end of the
Edtyassos. The Vilani’s war and subsequent purge had incited
the passionate Luriani to an unprecedented level of pure hatred.
After the purge was complete, the Vilani moved to colonise the
Luriani worlds. Most were deemed too devastated to be worth
it and these were left to recover as best they could. However,
a handful of worlds, most notably Daramm itself, were worthy
of colonisation. The result was a vicious cycle of action and
reaction. The Luriani, so filled with hate, would take any chance
to attack and kill these colonists. The Vilani would respond with
brutal retaliation, inciting yet more hatred and attacks. Soon
the Luriani worlds had a reputation as hellish places, where
the natives would slit Vilani throats as they lay sleeping. Thus
some 150 years after the Luriani Consolidation War opened,
the Vilani abandoned their efforts to colonise the Luriani worlds
and the sequence of events now known as the Edtyassos finally
came to an end. The Luriani were kept under the watchful eye
of heavy Vilani garrisons, but generally left alone to recover.

The Luriani population grew and their technological base
was re-established, though still heavily restricted. A thousand
years after the Edtyassos, Daramm was permitted a stable
TL9, though its manufacturing capacity and population were
still limited. It was during this period of recovery the Luriani
perception of the Edtyassos formed. Their experience of it
had primarily been preserved in art, music and poetry. These
accurately retained the emotional effects and even the gross
facts of the horrors that occurred, but the reasons were lost.
Some of these details do still exist, buried deep in Vilani
archives, hidden in lost caches on Daramm itself, and retained
in the scattered secretive Luriani worlds founded by refugees
from these events but it would take truly epic efforts to uncover
the whole truth.

The Protectorates
The Luriani remained firmly under a harsh occupation for the
next 2,700 years until the advancing Terran Confederation
reached the Ley Sector in -2223. The approaching Terrans
sparked yet another Luriani revolt and they gladly joined the
advancing Terran forces. Luriani expectations of a restoration

of their independence were not met nor were they granted
autonomy like some other races. In -2186 the Luriani launched
what they knew was a futile revolt against the Terrans. The
Vilani had deliberately limited the Luriani’s technological and
industrial base and they lacked any real ability to effectively
resist. Given their limited resources, it is considered remarkable
the Luriani were able to re-establish their sphere of worlds and
hold out for six years. Eventually, however, the Luriani once
again came under occupation.

The Luriani’s eventual salvation came through their love of
art and music. These facets of Luriani culture found a ready
audience amongst the Solomani and created widespread
sympathy for their plight. In -1932 Empress Juliana chartered
the Luriani Cultural Region. This granted Luriani communities
local autonomy under a planetary governor, who were in turn
answerable to a military governor-general. With the collapse
of the Rule of Man Governor-General Martinez of the LCR
found herself without support. She reached an agreement with
the Luriani, forming the First Luriani Protectorate in -1754. A
curious state, the Solomani provided the bulk of the state’s
administration, but it was overwhelmingly Luriani in character.
Over time, these Solomani and the Vilani stranded with the
collapse of the Rule of Man absorbed Luriani culture and in turn
provided the Luriani a stability previously lacked. This produced
the unique blended culture that now characterises the Luriani.
Much is made of the radical changes that created the Verasti
Dtareen and Mmarislusant, but the changes to Luriani culture
itself were also radical. Its previous strong gender differentiation
in roles disappeared, same sex relationships became accepted,
medical professionals separate from priests emerged, and
past norms such as arranged marriage and employment were
abandoned. The changes wrought on the Luriani during this
period were as large as those which created the Verasti Dtareen
and Mmarislusant.

The Protectorate was hampered from its beginning by the
limited economic base of the Luriani worlds. The Rule of Man
had continued the Vilani policy of limiting the Luriani industrial
base, and the Protectorate was never able to overcome this
limitation. Eventually the Protectorate engaged in a series
of wars with a neighbouring pocket empire. Though it was
eventually victorious, the strain crippled its limited productive
capacity. The Protectorate could have recovered and rebuilt, but
it appears the Luriani themselves no longer saw the need. All
the large states threatening them had ceased to exist and they
did not want to expend the resources. Thus in -1183, the Luriani
dominated Protectorate Assembly took the unprecedented
step of threatening to replace the Lord Protector and entire
Protectorate Council. Lord Protector De Valine acknowledged
the inevitable and the First Luriani Protectorate ceased to exist.

The Luriani worlds survived the Long Night comparatively well.
Gradually they rebuilt their industrial and economic base. While

Daramm itself remained at TL8 for much of the Long Night,
several other important Luriani worlds were able to regain the
jump drive (most importantly Secord) and slowly the previous
loose community of the Amidaresh re-emerged. The Gateway
renaissance sparked by traders from the Empty Quarter in the
-800 is seen as the turning point. Secord’s recovery of jump
technology allowed the expansion of the few remaining Wurlana
caravans and the resumption of widespread contact between
Luriani worlds. The next major development would occur in
-30 when long range Sylean scouts reached the Amidaresh.
It became clear to the Luriani that large scale interstellar
civilisation was returning, along with it the perceived threat to
their independence. In -29 a congress of Luriani leaders on
Daramm agreed to re-establish a formal Luriani state, and thus
the Second Luriani Protectorate was born.

The new state expanded rapidly and generally peacefully. By
12 it encompassed some 57 worlds. A number of brief wars
were fought with neighbouring states, but the situation began to
change in the early 70s with the expansion of the Imperium. The
Imperium attempted initially to absorb the Protectorate through
diplomatic means and these made good headway. However,
negotiations stumbled on the Protectorate’s insistence that their
‘family of worlds’ would remain intact. At this point Archduke
Ishagri attempted a show of force to intimidate the Protectorate.
Ishagri took a large portion of the Ley sector fleet and jumped
into the Rurur system, deliberately flaunting Protectorate
sovereignty. He hoped to awe the Protectorate into softening
its position by demonstrating the Imperium’s overwhelming
strength. The result was disaster and humiliation.

The Luriani War
Archduke Ishagri was aware the Protectorate fleet had
scheduled manoeuvres at Rurur. This fact was actually critical
to his plans. He hoped to capitalise on its expected dispersal
at their conclusion three days before his arrival on 014–93 to
avoid a conflict. What he did not know was the Protectorate
commander, Kamees Sherin Admiral, had extended the
exercises. Sherin, a supporter of the hard-line faction within
the Protectorate, was deeply mistrustful of the Imperium.
He interpreted the arrival of Ishagri’s fleet as an invasion
and engaged without making effort to ascertain Ishagari’s
intentions. The Battle of Rurur was one of the Imperial Navy’s
worst defeats. Ishagri’s fleet was annihilated and Protectorate
forces exploded across the frontier. The Imperium had fatally
underestimated the Protectorate Navy. The aquatic origins of
the Luriani made them naturally adept at three dimensional
warfare and their fleets were based around an early form of
battlerider, tactically far superior to Imperial battleships. Within
months, the Protectorate had advanced deep into Imperial
territory and was digging in.

The Imperial response to the disaster was deficient. The war
spread across three domains and leadership was weakened by

infighting. Imperial command ignored the option of advancing
from Antares or reinforcing the shattered Ley fleet, and
elected to launch a direct assault on the strongest portion of
the Protectorate’s defences. The Imperial defeat at Gaisaaru
ranks alongside that at Rurur and it would take the Fornast
fleet nearly two years to recover. The war settled into a long
period of stalemate; the Imperium was unable to renew the
offensive, and the Protectorate unwilling to advance further into
Imperial territory. The Protectorate instead launched deep raids
and capitalised on resentment at Imperial expansion to foment
unrest in the Imperium’s rear.

Eventually, the Imperium learned from its early defeats. In 96
the Imperial command had secured its rear, largely curtailed
the activities of the Luriani raiders, and was ready to resume
the offensive. However, two and a half years had allowed
the Protectorate to prepare a series of formidable defensive
positions. The Imperial offensive culminated in the Battle of
Iguu. The Imperium was successful in forcing the Protectorate
to withdraw, but the cost was huge and the Protectorate’s fleet
fell back in good order. The prospect of facing several more
such defensive lines brought about changes in the Imperial
political leadership. Sirean Fierana, Duke of Dirir, was appointed
Archduke. Sirean Archduke called a halt to the offensive and
offered an armistice and negotiations. What the Imperium was
unaware of was that the Battle of Iguu had resulted in severe
damage to the Protectorate’s vital jump-capable covering
forces. The Protectorate believed they would be unable to
extract their fleet from the next line and eagerly accepted the
chance for a negotiated settlement. On 347–96 the armistice
came into effect and the Luriani War came to an end.

Integration
The Treaty of Ghou which formally ended the Luriani War
resolved little of the tensions between the two states. Several
rebellious Imperial worlds were granted independence to form
a buffer zone and the Protectorate accepted technical status as
an Imperial client, though in practice this meant little. There was
now a legacy of mistrust on both sides and a cold war developed
that would last for decades. Sirean Archduke was convinced
that any attempt to absorb the Protectorate either by force or
negotiation was doomed to failure. He instead concentrated his
efforts on bringing the rimward portions of Ley sector into the
Imperium while keeping a watchful eye on the Protectorate. The
Protectorate for its part elected to concentrated on economic
and technological development. Its launch of its first prototype
jump-4 ship in 121 effectively closed the military option to the
Imperium. Many moderates within the Imperium feared any
chance of incorporating the Luriani had been lost forever.

It was Sirean’s daughter, Karen Archduchess, that began the
long path to repairing relations. With her ascension to the post
in 127, she began a series of overtures and programs designed
to increase trust and understanding. Karen Archduchess

capitalised on the Luriani’s love for art and music. Her cultural
offensive, as it became known, led to a far greater understanding
on both sides of the border. Tensions remained high and minor
incidents frequently flared, but slowly the legacy of mistrust
began to be overcome. Her successor, Arcla Archduke,
continued and intensified his mother’s policies. By this stage,
the Julian War was brewing and the Imperium was anxious
both to secure its flank and gain access to the Protectorate’s
jump-4 technology. Finally in 162, the first tentative talks about
integration began. Once again, process was slow for little had
changed. The Protectorate was still fundamentally mistrustful
of the large Imperium and its strong Vilani influences, and the
Imperium was still unwilling to grant the Luriani special status.
Talks effectively came to an end with the outbreak of the Julian
War in 175. The Protectorate had no interest in being drawn into
the war and took a stance of strict neutrality.

The Star Legion’s drive into Ley sector was the catalyst that finally
provided the impetuous to change the situation. The Julian’s
supply lines were long and vulnerable. They took advantage of
the Imperium’s reluctance to encroach upon Luriani territory to
protect them, and violations of Luriani neutrality were frequent.
In 188 the Luriani could no longer tolerate these violations and
Lady Protector Gamigaan Manish offered the Imperium an

alliance, and moved to sever the Julian supply lines. Though
their intervention had little effect on the ultimate outcome of the
war, the first signs of cordial relations with the Imperium had
emerged.

Talks on integration resumed in 191 on a far more positive note.
These discussions were long and drawn out, but eventually
an agreement was reached. In 202 the Treaty of Daramm was
signed and the process of incorporation began. Fifteen years
were granted to integrate the Protectorate into the Imperium.
The Protectorate was retained as the Luriani Cultural Region,
but in 217 this was finally disbanded and the Luriani became
part of the Imperium. It would take the Imperium nearly one
hundred years to capitalise on and spread the Luriani invention
of jump-4 drives, but it would provide a vital head start that has
allowed the Imperium to maintain a clear technological lead
over its rivals.

The Luriani Crisis
For over 700 years after their incorporation into the Imperium,
the Luriani were seen as model citizens and their loyalty to
the Emperor considered unwavering. Luriani rose high in the
Imperial administration, they served loyally in the Imperial forces,
and were seen as a solid bulwark on a vulnerable frontier. The
Luriani Archdukes of Gateway scrupulously remained out of
politics during the civil war, remaining loyal to the Imperium as a
whole without backing any faction, and allowing no claimant to
the throne to arise from their domain. Thus they retained much
of their power while the other Archdukes were curtailed in its
aftermath. The Luriani Crisis of the 1070’s, where the Luriani
suddenly moved from solidly loyal citizens to the very edge of
rebellion, therefore came as a complete surprise to most in the
Imperial hierarchy. However, those who knew the Luriani had
been warning of the coming storm for over 70 years.

The origins of the crisis lay with the appointment of Archduke
Erechs in 993, the first non-Luriani to hold the post since the
appointment of Sirean Archduke. This in itself caused little
concern amongst the Luriani, as the former Nells Archduke was
appointed Sector Duke of Ley, and their voice in the domain had
been preserved. However, Erechs and Nells were constantly at
loggerheads and the political infighting paralysed the domain.
With Nells’ death in 1021, Erechs’ appointed his own choice
to the post of Sector Duke and proceeded to gradually force
the Luriani out of the domain’s administration. Again this
caused little reaction amongst the Luriani, there were calls for
autonomy, but these were a tiny minority. Most Luriani saw the
Imperium had respected their special rights for 700 years and
they trusted that would not change.

However, Erechs and his successors continued to pursue
policies which left the Luriani isolated. In 1050 the Luriani
worlds were suffering from being excluded from Imperial
contracts and a serious economic downturn was occurring. It

was at this time the Luriani started to react. Luriani worlds were
entitled to maintain significant military forces, with substantial
offensive capabilities under the Treaty of Daramm. Few if any
had taken advantage of this for hundreds of years but now the
Luriani began to rearm. Attempts to move non-Luriani forces
onto Luriani worlds were vetoed. The LCA became vocally
outspoken in its opposition to the Archduke’s policies and by
the late 1060’s had become his leading opponent in the domain.

In 1071, Erechs grandson Stephen used his powers as ex-
officio head of the LCA to replace its entire board with one
of his choosing, comprising non-Luriani. With the stroke of a
pen he launched an assault on the centre of Luriani cultural
consciousness. Overnight, the Luriani turned from loyal citizens
to rebels, while support for autonomy moved from a tiny minority
to an overwhelming majority. The Luriani response was simply
to flout the Archduke’s authority. The old board of the LCA
continued as nothing had happened and the LCA’s bureaucracy
paid no heed to the new one. Archduke Stephen lost control
over one quarter of his domain. Imperial laws and decrees
continued to be enforced, but anything from the Archduke was
ignored. Worse than that was due to the penetration of Luriani
into the domain’s administration, huge sections of its military
and bureaucracy became politically unreliable.

Matters came to a head in 1074. It was clear by then the Luriani
were preparing for war and their preparations would soon be
complete. At that point, Archduke Stephen moved a motion in
the Moot to void the Treaty of Daramm as a prelude to the use
of force to resolve the situation. The only reason the Luriani
did not move to open rebellion was Brandon Minomoru Count
of Daramm. His voice of reason and appeal to the Emperor
himself prevented Stephen’s motion from passing and averted
a disaster. In the wake of the crisis, much of the domain’s
hierarchy was replaced and Brandon raised to the position of
Archduke in 1076. Brandon remains wildly popular both with
the Luriani and in the domain at large, and his steady hand over
the past 30 years has largely defused the remaining tensions.

The Human Exodus
For almost 700 years the demographics of Luriani space had
been slowly shifting from its overwhelming Luriani character. A
long period of falling Luriani birth rates coupled with non-Luriani
migration from other regions of the Imperium shifted the balance
away from Luriani majorities. By 900 half the worlds of the
former Luriani Protectorate had lost their Luriani character and
on some the Luriani had even fallen to a minority. The situation
began to change in the 950s. The introduction of c chromosome
technology sparked a growth in Luriani birth rates. Also, the
government of Daramm introduced subsidies to encourage
migration from heavily populated worlds. Most of these migrants
chose to settle on existing Luriani worlds. Over the next 70 years
the large families now a feature of Luriani society developed and
the population balance began to shift back.

Initially, this was almost imperceptible and went unnoticed
amongst the non-Luriani population. However, as Luriani
populations began to show significant increase, due both to
births and migration from Daramm, concerns began to emerge.
These concerns grew as tensions deepened and Luriani worlds
entered an economic downturn. In the 1020s some non-Luriani
began to leave. At first a trickle, this turned into a steady flow by
the 1030s. This migration was masked by the natural increase of
the Luriani population, but the migrants were productive adults
and the increase of dependent children. Thus the migration
made the downturn worse, further encouraging the trend
towards emigration. When tensions grew into the Luriani Crisis
in the early 1060s, this flow turned into a flood. Billions of non-
Luriani left in the fifteen year period between 1060 and 1075.
The economic dislocation this caused was massive and the
ongoing recession worsened, further feeding the exodus. On
some less populated worlds this lead to economic collapse and
complete depopulation. Even with the end of the Luriani Crisis,
the exodus continued. By 1085, the non-Luriani population had
essentially gone. Tens of billions had left and most of those who
remained elected to integrate themselves into the Luriani.

For the most part, this exodus was peaceful. The non-Luriani left
willingly and while neither the LCA or local Luriani governments
encouraged the exodus, they did nothing to slow or halt it
either. On a few worlds the resulting tensions led to violence. A
charismatic nationalistic Luriani government took control of the
world of Lakeham (now known by its Luriani name of Lakam)
and introduced markedly pro-Luriani policies. The local human
population responded with active resistance and terrorism.

Even with the current booming Luriani economy it is considered
unlikely the non-Luriani population will re-establish itself as, due
to the dislocation the exodus caused, and virtually all Luriani
worlds now have policies strongly discouraging such migration.

The Current Situation
Despite the return to normality with the resolution of the Luriani
Crisis, the Luriani themselves remain quietly restless. The crisis
re-awoke old fears about the Imperium’s motives amongst
many and most Luriani worlds have not reduced their fleets and
membership of the Iadtlu remains at record levels. The LCA
has launched a major program to improve and expand their
technological and economic base. Brandon Archduke remains
well regarded, both with the Luriani and the rest of the domain. He
and his wife Imelda are seen as models of Luriani respectability.
His young heir Tranian appears to the Luriani as trustworthy if a
little dull, though some would prefer his rather less dour brother
Kamees or wild sister Afira to inherit the title. Brandon’s seeming
insistence on not entering a full ami relationship is regarded as
a slightly scandalous in some conservative quarters, but most
respect his decision. The Luriani nobility is slowly increasing
(currently there are 29 high and 43 local hereditary nobles of
Luriani heritage, with 84 Archducal baronets), though most
Luriani worlds still lack an associated noble. Both the Archduke
and Emperor himself are actively seeking to expand the Luriani
nobles, though neither is willing to allow unsuitable candidates to
be honoured simply to make up the numbers. The Luriani appear
to have entered a stage of watchful vigilance, content with the
situation at present but cautious about the future.
On the world
Tomauu (likewise
now known by
its Luriani name
of Arum), the
local dictatorship
attempted to
suppress the
Luriani majority
with draconian
laws that would
develop into a
vicious civil war.
In 1000 the former
Protectorate’s total
population was
approximately 91.4
billion, with only
two thirds of them
Luriani. Even with
a hundred years
of substantial
Luriani growth, it
now stands at only
77.3 billion, with
over 95% Luriani.

# Characters

Initial Character Generation
Luriani characters are generated as normal with the following
alterations.

**Race:** Luriani characters may be either racial Luriani or human
(from the Verasti Dtareen and Mmarislusant subcultures).

**Enhanced Dexterity:** The Luriani brain is far more capable of
processing spatial information than the human norm. Therefore
racial Luriani receive a +1 DM to their initial Dexterity.

> [!info]- Excerpt from the Journals of Sara Maval Dame
We were shopping, again. Seshko did love to shop. I was
glancing at some of the glossy posters; you know, the ones
teenagers plaster their walls with, holovid and pop stars.
One caught my eye. Ruggedly handsome, strongly muscled
arms. He reminded me of Gami Iishakaa, my crush when I
was twelve.

I asked her, ‘Who’s that?’

She turned. ‘Despi Tobraial, the schoolgirls’ latest idol.’

‘Holovid star, yes?’ He had that look.

‘Oh no, he’s an archaeologist.’

luriani charactEr gEnEration chEcklist
Luriani character generation should follow these steps

1. Select race and culture. Available races and cultures
   are; racial Luriani, human Verasti Dtareen, and human
   Mmarislusant.
2. Select gender. Available genders are; male Luriani,
   female/c Luriani, female/D Luriani, female/d Luriani,
   male human and female human.
3. Roll characteristics and apply modifications
4. Select a home world and gain skills. Luriani characters
   are normally born on Luriani worlds but may be born on
   any Imperial world
5. Choose a career. These steps are the same as those in
   the Career Generation Checklist as in the _Traveller Core_
   _Rulebook_ page 5. Note that human female/c characters
   are limited to a maximum of three terms.

Enhanced Endurance: The Luriani’s ability to store oxygen
and insulating fat layers increase their Endurance. Racial
Luriani receive a +1 DM to their initial Endurance.

Weak Social Standing: Luriani society tends towards a flat
social structure and have little in the way of hereditary nobility.
Racial Luriani characters receive a –2 DM on their initial Social
Standing. Also, due to the limited number of Luriani hereditary
nobles, Social Standing will most frequently represent wealth,
fame or a life peerage.

Gender: Racial Luriani have three genders, male, female/D and
female/d. There is a normal split between males and the two
female genders (50/50) but there is a bias towards female/D
amongst females. Luriani female/d characters have special
rules relating to reproduction, but other than that there is no
effective difference (indeed, their existence is virtually unknown
outside the Luriani themselves). A female character may be
either female/D or female/d according to choice. There is also
now emerging in Luriani society a new gender, the human
female/c. These are extremely rare and only encountered in
exceptional circumstances.

Speed
On land, Luriani are slightly slower than normal humans.
However, in water they have a considerable speed advantage.

When swimming, a racial Luriani can maintain a speed of up to
ten kilometres per hour indefinitely, and are able to reach twenty
kilometres per hour for several hours. They are also capable of
a dash speed of up to forty kilometres per hour for short periods.
This involves generating considerable quantities of adrenaline
and forcing their muscles to consume oxygen at an extreme
rate. A racial Luriani may only use dash speed for a maximum
of five minutes. After dashing, a racial Luriani will be utterly
exhausted, reducing their effective Strength by –3 (minimum 2).
It requires 2d6 hours for a racial Luriani to recover from using
dash speed.

While using dash speed, a racial Luriani’s effective Strength is
increased by +2. This enhanced strength may only be used in
water as, without the heat dissipating effect of water, the racial
Luriani will lose control within seconds; they will spasm violently,
suffering 1d3 damage every round, and suffer brain damage
due to the increase in body temperature within four minutes.
These effects can be stopped by the use of a slow drug antidote
(Cr. 500 per dose).

Pressure Sense
The Luriani sense of touch is far more sensitive than humans,
but their actual pressure sense is dependent on a number of
lines of extremely responsive nerves. While these can be found
on any part of the body (and are as unique to a Luriani as their
fingerprints) they are primarily on the face and back. A Luriani
with their back covered cannot use this ability behind them and
one with their face covered can not use it in front. A Luriani’s
pressure sense allows them to detect movement, distance and
direction, as well as the rough size and shape of an object. This
ability has a range of 1 km underwater but is limited to 10 m in
air. Each 10kph of wind or water speed reduces this range by
20%.

Names
The rules of etiquette regarding Luriani names and their use
are complex. Names are important to them and using the wrong
form of address will cause offence. Racial Luriani and Verasti
Dtareen formal names are constructed with a personal name,
followed by birth parents’ names (father first for males, mother
first for females).

There will then be two family names. The first is the birth family
name, the second is the current family names, depending on the
individual’s relationship status. An unmarried Luriani will repeat
the birth family name, one in a practice or match relationship
will take their partner’s birth family name, and one in a full ami
relationship will take the name of the ami (usually one of the
birth family names). Finally they will have a title; this can be
their profession, military or administrative rank or noble title if
they possess one.

Mmarislusant names are constructed slightly differently. First
will be a personal name, followed by a family name, then their
clan name, the word Mmarislusant and finally their title.

Semi-formal names are constructed using the current family,
name and title. If the title is unknown, the generalised Wa for
women or Lul for men may be used. These may also be used
on their own if the individual’s name is unknown. Informal
names use the personal name and current family name. Finally
casual names (used with friends and family) consist only of the
personal name (an offer by a Luriani simply to address them by
their casual name is an indication of an extremely favourable
initial reaction). Beyond the casual is a level of intimacy where
a Luriani will stop using a person’s name and simply use a term
of endearment instead. These terms can be virtually anything
but will be unique for that person. The casual name may still be
used in situations where emphasis is desired. The personal and
family names themselves can be drawn from any of the Luriani,
Solomani or Vilani traditions, though Mmarislusant favour Vilani
names. Luriani and Verasti Dtareen, on the other hand, take
freely from all three.

In military or administrative service, Luriani generally use rank
title on its own as a mark of respect. It is rare to hear a Luriani
say sir or ma’am, and then generally only in a humorous sense.
When a Luriani say’s sir, they are making a joke, perhaps
indicating they consider the person overly self-important.

Noble Titles
There are very limited number of Luriani hereditary nobles,
mostly drawn from the Verasti Dtareen (about 55%) and

Mmarislusant (roughly 35%). Around 60 to 70 are high nobility,
though there are somewhat more who are part of the local
nobility with hereditary titles originally awarded for service or
achievement, but they are still rare, perhaps around 100 to
130 of. Beyond these two groups are the hereditary Archducal
Baronets. The curious nature in which the Luriani give their
loyalty to the Imperium means they hold an honour granted
by the Archduke in much higher regard than the same honour
granted by the Emperor himself. The Luriani regard Archducal
Baronets as akin in status to an Imperial Count. However, even
these are still fairly rare, with their number laying around 250.

The Luriani hereditary nobility was hit particularly hard by the
Luriani Crisis. In the lead up to it, many Luriani titles were
revoked (often on spurious grounds) or extinguished. A few
more extreme supporters of independence were revoked after.
Their number has been slowly increasing but it will be a long
time before they return to even modest numbers. However,
even now the Luriani nobility includes an Archduke and three
subsector dukes, giving it influence beyond their limited number
might suggest.

While there are few hereditary Luriani nobles, there are a
considerable number of Luriani with non-hereditary titles. The
Luriani appear to have a strong preference for these, regarding
the idea of a title simply because of an accident of birth as rather
odd. There are many Luriani with life peerages and knighthoods
awarded for service or achievement. Once again, a life honour
awarded by the Archduke of Gateway is held in higher regard
than one from the Emperor. The numbers of these were thinned
a little during the Luriani Crisis, but nowhere near to the extent
to which the hereditary nobility was reduced.

Luriani Orders of Chivalry
While Luriani may be awarded a knighthood in any Imperial
order, almost all are awarded in either the Order of Gateway

or Order of Eerynaaia. According to Imperial precedence,
the Order of Eerynaaia is the more prestigious; according to
the Luriani, it is the Order of Gateway. In practice, it matters
little to the average Imperial citizen, nor do most pay much
attention to the precise ranks within the orders; a knighthood
is a knighthood. The major difference is that membership of the
Order of Eerynaaia is awarded by the Emperor and the Order
of Gateway by the Archduke of Gateway. Contrary to common
Imperial usage, female Luriani knights still generally prefer to
use the obsolete title Dame in preference to Sir. For example
the knight known to Imperial protocol as Sir Sara Lisanii Trace
(C.G.) is usually referred to in Luriani society as Sara Maval
Dame (C.G.). It is known she prefers the latter form.

The Order of Eerynaaia is a minor Imperial order, founded
by Empress Porfiria in 317, specifically to honour Imperial
citizens of Luriani descent. One of the , minor Imperial orders,
its membership is restricted to racial Luriani, Verasti Dtareen
and Mmarislusant. Ordinary members are known as either a
Aralul or Arawa y Eerynaaia (who take the post nominal letters
Ar.Ee) depending on gender (an Aralul is male, Arawa female).
Ranking above these are the Giaralul and Giarawa y Eerynaaia
(Gar.Ee).

The order is theoretically commanded by the Iraralul or Irarawa
y Eerynaaia (Iar.Ee). The current Iraralul of the order is Emperor
Strephon, though the order’s affairs are effectively run by its
deputy commander on Daramm. As might be expected with a
minor order, its precedence is quite low amongst other Imperial
orders.

The Order of Gateway is one of the domain orders, awarded
by Archdukes rather than the Emperor. As such, it ranks below
other Imperial orders, though to the Luriani a knighthood in
this order is extremely prestigious. The Order of Gateway is
the smallest of all the domain orders, but actually ranks third in
precedence, below the Ancient Order of Vland and above the
Order of Ilelish. Normal members are ranked as Companions of
the Order of Gateway (C.G.). It’s senior members are Knights
of the Order of Gateway (K.G.). The current Knight Commander
of the Order of Gateway (K.C.G.) is Brandon Archduke of
Gateway. It is important to remember this is not an exclusively
or even predominantly Luriani order, and the Archduke awards
titles to citizens throughout the Domain of Gateway.

Reactions
The Luriani have a widespread negative reputation throughout
the Imperium and surrounding regions as being overly
emotional and unstable, and most initial reactions will be based
on this perception. This should be represented by a–1 DM to
all non-Luriani reaction rolls towards Luriani characters. This
penalty should be freely increased at the referees discretion,
with perhaps a –2 DM as the starting point for anyone who has
not already had dealings with Luriani. Note that this penalty

**Common Luriani Terms of Endearment**

Term Origin
Dearie Anglic
Sweetie Anglic
Honey Anglic
Dinkir Old High Vilani ‘humorous fish’
Ikark Old High Vilani, a type of sweet fruit
Kingeii Old High Vilani ‘sweetheart’
Bawa or Balul Luriani ‘little woman’ and ‘little man’
respectively
Eshal Luriani lover, indicates a high degree of
intimacy
Kawa or Kalul Luriani, ‘old woman’ and ‘old man,’ used for
someone older
Kucuin Luriani, roughly ‘darling’
Disra Luriani, a type of fruit pie

applies equally to racial Luriani and Verasti Dtareen characters,
but not to Mmarislusant characters.

The Luriani themselves also have a prejudice towards those of
Vilani birth and a –1 DM should be applied for Luriani reactions
to Vilani characters. However, it is important to note that this
prejudice is based on mistrust and not dislike. A Luriani will
rarely react to an individual Vilani with active antagonism.
Rather, they will remain distant and cautious. This mistrust
can be over come given time and it is more than possible for
Luriani to come to respect and form friendships with individual
Vilani, if their actions show the initial mistrust to be unfounded.
Curiously, by extension, racial Solomani (referred to as Dtareen
or Terrans by the Luriani) are well regarded as liberators from
Vilani oppression, despite the fact the Luriani suffered several
hundred years of Solomani occupation as well. Consequently,
Luriani react to racial pure Solomani with a +1 DM (note this is
not reciprocated by or even generally known to Solomani).

Military Service
Many Luriani, especially amongst the Verasti Dtareen and
Mmarislusant, elect to follow a military career. The Imperial
military has long recognised the value of the Luriani as soldiers;
the Navy particularly encourages the enlistment of Luriani.
However, it is also recognised there are problems with their
service. On the purely physical level, their unique biochemistry
can cause problems and the webbed nature of their hands
requires non-standard equipment. Moreover, it has long been
recognised the nature of Luriani and their preference for
informal lines of authority means they will often perform poorly
when subject to normal discipline. Therefore, all three services
tend to have Luriani serve in purely Luriani units. Many of these
units have an elite reputation, personnel tend to stay with their
unit much longer than usual, and they are generally utilised in
roles where their specialist abilities are most useful (the Imperial
Marine Luriani aquatic assault units are particularly noteworthy).
Both the Verasti Dtareen and Mmarislusant are strongly drawn
toward military careers, usually serving alongside their racial
Luriani brethren. Verasti Dtareen appear to be particularly
successful in this role, often rising to high rank.

Discipline in these units is significantly more informal than
normal, closely resembling that of the Imperial Interstellar
Scout Service. It is based heavily on mutual respect between
commanders and commanded, coupled with a strong sense of
family. These concepts seem to come naturally to the social
nature of the Luriani and the system works well with them.
However, it requires time for these foundations to build and they
are easily disrupted. Factors that encourage esprit de corps are
strongly encouraged. Personnel stay with their units and units
with their higher formations. Two entire Imperial fleets (the 124th,

and 129th) are recruited exclusively from Luriani, with individual
squadrons in a number of other fleets. Units are frequently
recruited from a specific geographic location. Changes in
command are handled gradually and often from within the unit
itself. Imperium doctrine dictates it requires between two and
four years to bring a new Luriani unit to combat readiness.
Luriani worlds are able to shorten this process via a trained
militia system known as the Iadtlu that provides a pool of
personnel already familiar with one another, but even they
cannot raise units quickly.

Iadtlu
The Iadtlu is the traditional militia of the Luriani. In addition to
its role as a trained militia, the Iadtlu also functions as a youth
training corps, encouraging good citizenship and moral values.
Children may join from the age of eight onwards, though active
service is not permitted until 18. Many Luriani considering a
military career will elect to join the Iadtlu during childhood in
preparation for their intended career. There are two branches of
the Iadtlu, covering space and ground operations.

Eeniag
Eeniag is a traditional Luriani martial art, and instruction in it is
part of Iadtlu training. It involves a variety of unarmed techniques
and the traditional Luriani bladed weapon, the lysh. Any Luriani
character with at least Melee (blade) 1 and Melee (unarmed) 1
may elect to be a practitioner of Eeniag.

Careers
Luriani can be found in any career from the Traveller Core
Rulebook. They are heavily drawn to be Entertainers and
well represented among the Army, Marines, Navy, Scholars
and Scouts. They are poorly represented among Nobility and
Rogues.

Luriani and the Scout Service
While the Luriani are strongly drawn to and in many ways
make natural Scouts, there are limitations on their service. The
Luriani are emotionally unsuited to the solitude often required
in the Scout Service. Therefore, despite their natural skill as
pilots, Luriani are rarely found in the X-Boat service or on lone
detached duties. They are most frequently employed on large
scout cruisers, exploration and survey ships.

Luriani Rank Titles
Luriani rank titles are derived from those of the former Luriani
Protectorates, which are in turn based on those of the Rule of
Man (most are transliterations into Standard Luriani). Luriani
in Imperial service technically use Imperial rank titles, but they
tend to ignore this and use their own.

Wurlana
The Wurlana are the descendants of the crews of the great raft ships that used to roam Daramm’s ocean. The crews of these ships
spent their entire lives aboard, only coming ashore when needing to re-supply or build new vessels. Their descendants do the
same among the stars, spending most of their lives on ships wandering from system to system, trading as they go. Grouped into
many clans, Wurlana do not enlist - they are born into their career.

The Arynti were traditionally wandering Luriani minstrels, travelling from settlement to settlement, island to island. They carried
the Luriani’s oral tradition through story telling, poetry and music. Few nowadays wander, and most have settled urban civilised
lifestyles, though some still tour extensively. They continue the traditions of story telling and preserving knowledge through
performance. Well respected amongst the Luriani, many become stars and even superstars of popular culture, though a handful

**Cross-breeds**
Cross-breeds between Luriani and other humans take two
forms; natural and artificial. Natural cross-breeds are known as
Leramiyasin and can only be born to Luriani female/d mothers.
They are always sterile and normally have profound physical
and mental disabilities. They are usually cared for by charitable
institutions and only rarely seen outside these environments.
However, very rarely, a naturally occurring cross-breed will be
born without defects. Other than being sterile, they often pass
as Luriani, though can inherit some of their father’s heritage.

Artificial cross-breeds were originally achieved via in-vitro
fertilisation, but now can be born naturally. They may be born
to any mothers, though most require drug treatment to prevent
rejection of the pregnancy. The Luriani have no special name
for them, though outsiders call them hybrids - the Luriani will
take great offence to anyone using this term as, to them, they
are simply Luriani. All cross-breeds often inherit an incomplete
set of traits from both parents, though they tend to favour their
mother. Most cross-breeds are cd Luriani females though the
last three decades have seen the emergence of the human
female/c type. These are cross-breeds with a cc chromosome

structure and, while considered human, have some potential of
developing Luriani traits from the genetic background.

Players looking for an interesting challenge may choose to play
a Luriani cross-breed. Cross-breeds are always female.

After rolling for characteristics, a cross-breed character should
determine its parentage and what traits it inherits, using the
tables below.

11 Cross-breed mother/Verasti Dtareen father
12 Cross-breed mother/Mmarislusant father

Once parentage has been determined, roll on the table below

## Equipment and Technology

The Luriani were once leaders in technology; they were the
first significant group to develop jump-4 drives in 121 and much
of their technology was absorbed into the Imperium with their
incorporation in 202. In many ways, they are ideally suited
to technology and science; curious, creative and capable of
thinking in new and unusual ways. However, since becoming
part of the Imperium they have preferred to concentrate on their
first loves, artistic and cultural pursuits. Secure in that position,
their technological lead disappeared. If anything, Luriani worlds
now lag slightly behind the Imperial norm, though the Luriani
Crisis shook the Luriani out of their lethargy. The LCA has
launched a major program to improve their technological base.
This program has yet to show its fruits, but the Luriani are once
again committed to matching the best science has to offer.

Equipment Notes
The Luriani’s webbed extremities make using equipment not
designed for their hands uncomfortable (apply a –1 DM). Such

equipment is common close to their homeworlds, but further
away it becomes harder to locate and more expensive. For
all Luriani specific equipment apply a –1 DM to locate if using
the Availability rules and a +10% surcharge to any cost. This
modifier does not apply to humans using Luriani devices, which
they can use without penalty.

Low Berths
Luriani make extensive use of low berths for travel and medical
purposes. Their natural ability to slow their metabolism allows
them to use these without any risk.

Drugs and Medicine
The different biochemical nature of Luriani physiology means
medications intended for humans can have unpredictable or
even fatal effects on them. A full range of Luriani specific drugs
have been developed, but their availability and cost depends
on the distance from the Luriani’s homeworlds. Naturally, most
Luriani travelling far from home will tend to take a selection of
such drugs with them. The same DM regarding availability and
cost for equipment apply to Luriani medications.

Reproductive Genetic Technology
The one area where the Luriani do still lead the Imperium is in
genetics, in particular reproductive genetics. Their long struggle
with the issue of Leramiyasin births and search for a method
by which mixed race couples can conceive children has lead
to extremely advanced capabilities in these areas. Also the
LCA expends considerable effort to ensure this technology is
available on all Luriani worlds. Therefore, all Luriani worlds
should be regarded as having TL15 genetic technology with
their capacity in reproductive genetics being at TL16, regardless
of the base Tech Level of the world. The Luriani have long
had a policy of freely sharing these advances. Reproductive
technology pioneered by the Luriani can be found in extensive
use elsewhere, both in the Imperium and beyond.

In-vitro Fertilisation and Same Sex Conception
In-vitro fertilisation is a common option many Luriani couples
unable to conceive normally take advantage of. The Luriani
developed most of these techniques during the First Protectorate.
The Luriani’s unusual D/d chromosome system actually makes
this relatively simple for them. In-vitro fertilisation for same sex
Luriani couples was one of their first advances in reproductive
genetics and achieved in -1652. The techniques were extended
to human couples in -1646. Gender selection for female human

> [!info]- Excerpt from the Journals of Sara Maval Dame

If you had to list the technological wonders of the Imperium,
you probably wouldn’t put a ten year old blonde girl sucking
a lollipop on it. But then you may not know, Luriani don’t
normally have blonde hair.

They say Luriani lose it without warning. They can, but do
usually they give you warning; if you know what to listen for
(‘I’m so sorry My Lady, I didn’t catch that’).

Nothing seemed to have changed, her voice as friendly
and pleasant as ever. For all the world, you’d have thought
she’d simply been lost in thought and not heard. But, My
Lady, I had really put my foot in it.

They put how to apologise in the Luriani phrase book right
after how to say hello. Seems an odd place, but they do it
for good reason. When an angry Luriani says sorry to you,
apologise back. Immediately.

‘I’m so sorry I didn’t mean to mumble. I said your sister is
beautiful.’

She smiled and nodded. Luriani are quick to take offence
but if it’s accidental, they’re just as quick to forgive.

lysh
Regarded as the traditional weapon of the Luriani, the lysh is a leaf bladed short sword suitable for one or two handed use.
Designed for use in confined spaces or underwater, the lysh is the normal dress blade of the Luriani military. The most remarkable
feature is that it is not normally made of metal, but wood. When properly treated, wood from the arbusodt tree takes on the
properties of high carbon steel. It is this the lysh is traditionally made from, with the treatment giving the weapon its distinctive
black and crimson patterning. It should be noted, despite the unusual materials used in its construction, arbusodt wood so
treated has a high metal content and is very dense. Thus a lysh is easily detected by portal sensors.

There are several different type of lysh, varying in method of production, cost and availability. The most common are reproduction
lysh. These are not made of arbusodt wood, but from metals or other similar materials, then coated to mimic the appearance
of a traditional lysh. Reproduction lysh are commonly available and cost Cr. 100 each. They are used for practice by students
(however, they are still perfectly functional weapons).

The next is the mass produced lysh. While constructed from traditional materials, they are manufactured by machine and thus
their patterning is random. These are the standard issue dress blade for Luriani officers. They are easily obtainable on most
Luriani worlds and cost Cr. 300.

Above these are the true lysh, crafted by master weaponsmiths using jealously guarded techniques handed down through
generations. There are probably only 10,000 people alive who know the techniques for their manufacture. Each weaponsmith
takes pride in creating a distinctive signature patterning. The cost starts at Cr. 2,500 and goes up from there depending on the
renown of the weaponsmith. A true lysh from a famous weaponsmith can easily cost tens of thousands of credits. Availability is
also often restricted with long waiting lists being common.

The final type of lysh is the green lysh. Very rarely, flaws in the treatment process of the arbusodt wood will result in a lysh with
green streaks in addition to the normal black and crimson. These only occur with the handmade true lysh and are regarded as
works of art rather than a weapon. These lysh are extremely rare; if one is available at all its cost might start at Cr. 100,000 and
increase dramatically from there.

Lysh: TL0; Melee (small blade); Damage 2d6+2 one handed, 3d6+2 two handed; Cost variable; Mass 0.5kg.

couples was perfected in -1523 and finally became available
for Luriani female couples in -1321. This involves switching the
D chromosome into a d chromosome. These techniques would
later play a vital role in the development of c chromosome
technology.

Initially, in the case of male same sex couples, these techniques
involved the use of donor eggs and a female surrogate to carry
the child to term. However in -1307 Luriani geneticists perfected
a blank artificial egg that removed the need for a donor egg.
The need for a surrogate was eventually overcome with the
development of the uterine replicator, though many Luriani male
couples still prefer to use a female friend as a surrogate.

Uterine Replicator
Also known as an artificial womb, these were first developed
during the Long Night in -127. The Luriani have long possessed
the ability to complete a full term gestation artificially. These
provide life support for the growing foetus, supply the embryo
with nutrients, stimulate the development of the immune system
and perform all the functions of a normal female uterus. These
devices are available in all Luriani maternity facilities. The
Luriani’s preference for natural pregnancy restricts the use

of these devices in their society to when needed for medical
reasons, but they are in widespread use throughout the
Imperium as a whole.

Genetic Screening
The Luriani have developed techniques which enable embryos
to be screened for genetic defects and for those defects to
be corrected within the womb. They have all but eliminated
such defects from their own population. Genetic screening is
available free of charge to any Luriani parents who wish to avail
themselves of it, though a modest fee may be charged for others.
Virtually all Luriani parents take advantage of this. If a defect is
detected, the actual decision on whether or not to correct it is
left to the parents, but again, the vast majority do. Subsidies
and grants exist for parents unable to afford for a defect to be
corrected. The exception to the voluntary nature of screening
is any pregnancy involving a c chromosome. All Luriani worlds
have regulations making genetic screening during these
pregnancies compulsory and most require any defects to be
corrected. Luriani accept this as a prudent precaution given the
nature of the technology. Naturally, such compulsory screening
and any subsequent genetic corrections are free of charge.

science. They are willing to occasionally create what is termed
a true child. This is a clone with deliberately inserted genetic
alterations to ensure it develops as an individual distinct from
the original. Luriani techniques in this are quite advanced and
subtle. Using methods pioneered for same sex conception they
can even create a clone of a different gender from the original.

They will also participate in the rehabilitation of clone doubles.
Luriani methods in this are actually a mixture of psychological and
genetic techniques. Subtle modifications are made to the clone’s
genetic structure to enable differences to appear. Naturally, the
ability to do this is somewhat limited with a grown individual.
In addition to these genetic alterations, the clone undergoes
intensive psychotherapy with the intent of enabling a distinct
individual personality to emerge. Unlike similar techniques used
elsewhere, the Luriani do not wipe the clone’s memories. These
are integrated into the new personality, allowing the clone to
retain their earlier experiences. While expensive, Luriani
geneticists and psychologists will often provide these services
free of charge. The process of rehabilitation normally takes two
or three years.

Accelerated Foetal Development
Developed first in the mid-700s, this technology has gone
through several versions. It allows for the gestation period to
be dramatically reduced but can only be used in conjunction
with a uterine replicator, the pharmaceuticals used would kill
any mother. The Luriani make extremely sparing use of this
technology, restricting it to cases of clear and compelling
medical or compassionate grounds, normally in the case of
a terminally ill parent, allowing them to see their child before
death. It is more widely used elsewhere.

Pregnancy Drugs
Developed from the naturally occurring hormones produced by
Luriani woman during pregnancy, a full course of these taken
during pregnancy reduces the chances of complications during
child birth. The differences in human and Luriani physiology
mean a different set of drugs are required for each. A side-
effect of these drugs is the increased production of endorphins,
giving them a mild euphoric effect. They are sometimes used as
recreational drugs, though this is highly frowned upon.

Anti-rejection Drugs
Originally developed in conjunction with same sex-conception,
these allow a human surrogate to carry a Luriani child to
term and vice versa. They are also used extensively with c
chromosome technology, as they allow women not carrying
the mutant d chromosome to carry a cross-breed child to term.
These drugs are rather unpleasant to take, frequently inducing
nausea, disorientation and giddiness. Temporarily reduce the
Endurance of anyone taking them by –2, and Dexterity by –1.

cultural attituDEs toW arD rEproDuctivE
tEchnology
Despite having access to a wide range of extremely
advanced reproductive technologies, the Luriani have a
cultural bias towards natural reproduction. Much of this
technology is used sparingly, normally when a natural option
is unavailable. Luriani male same sex couples usually prefer
to use a female friend as a surrogate rather than an artificial
womb. For their part, a Luriani woman would likely consider
it an honour, an ultimate expression of their obligation to
hospitality. Luriani women (particularly the female/d gender)
generate a large quantity of endorphins during pregnancy. It
has also been found that physical activity during pregnancy
generates a number of chemicals that encourage an easy
birth. Drugs do exist to replicate these effects, and work on
humans as well, though Luriani practices also encourage
healthy physical activity during pregnancy.

There are two common exceptions to this rule regarding the
Luriani preference for natural procreation, both relating to
the c chromosome technology. The first is where there is a
risk of a Leramiyasin child. In certain circumstances, there
is a high chance that a couple including either an artificial
cross-breed or human woman carrying a c chromosome
can conceive a child with Leramiyasin defects. In these
cases it is usual for such couples to use in-vitro fertilisation
to conceive. Most Luriani governments strongly encourage
this practice, subsidising the fees for such conceptions.
The second exception is were two human parents will
deliberately elect to insert a c chromosome into their human
child’s DNA, thus allowing them to have children with a
Luriani partner in adult life. In this case, most governments
provide the same 90% subsidy for the first two children as
with a cross-breed.

This technology does have the potential to allow any trait or
characteristic of an embryo to be either enhanced or eliminated.
The Luriani themselves use it strictly to correct recognised
genetic defects, and actively attempt to prevent others using
the technology for any other purpose. However, since it is in
widespread use, their success is limited.

Cloning
Cloning itself is a relatively simple TL 9 technology, one
the Luriani have long had access to. While Luriani cloning
techniques are amongst the best available, they make little use
of them. It is rare an individual Luriani would seek to have a child
without a long term partner to share the responsibility with,and
generally in such cases they would seek out a friend to provide
additional genetic material. Luriani regard the use of clones to
replicate an existing individual’s personality (by certain high
ranking nobles to provide doubles) as an obscene perversion of

Chromosome Technology
When most Imperial citizens think of Luriani and technology
they think of the invention of jump-4 drives in 121. However, the
Luriani regard their development of c chromosome technology
in 932 as their crowning technological achievement. This
is the technology that finally allowed some degree of inter-
fertility between Luriani and humans. It is based on the study
of the very rare occurrence of natural Xd cross-breeds that
lack Leramiyasin birth defects. Study of these allowed the
isolation of the genes which caused the defects. This is
the key to the success of c chromosome technology. The
procedure calls for major alterations to the parent’s egg or
sperm. First, the Leramiyasin genes from both parents are
altered to a benign form, then an ‘off’ Luriani gender gene is
added to the X chromosome, turning it into a c chromosome.
Finally, the X chromosome and, if required, d chromosome
are altered to mimic the mutant d which enables Leramiyasin
births. The result is essentially a fertile Xd cross-breed without
Leramiyasin defects.
These cross-breeds are still imperfect;
often not all the parents’
heritage is inherited, their
fertility is somewhat
limited, and most
females need to take
unpleasant anti-
rejection drugs to
carry them, but
they are still a
marvel of genetic
science.

Remarkable as
the first generation
capacities of the c
chromosome appear,
the results of the second
and subsequent generations
are considered even more incredible.
As part of its facility for two way fertility, c chromosome
technology has the ability to alter an X or d chromosome,
correcting the genes which cause Leramiyasin defects and
changing it to mimic the mutant d form. In a third generation,
the possibility of a cc child arises. These are the true marvel
of the c chromosome technology, a female child born to two
human parents who inherits Luriani traits. This technology is
currently producing its eighth generation and the c chromosome
is spreading through Luriani society.

The final advance in the c chromosome project was achieved
in 987 with the introduction of technology which allowed the
Luriani gender selection gene to be altered from ‘on’ to ‘off.’
While this technology had theoretically been available via their

work on same sex conception, it proved formidably difficult to
extend it to c chromosome technology.

C/c Chromosome Technology
It was always intended for c chromosome technology to be
an interim step. The level of inter-fertility it provides is far from
perfect and Luriani geneticists are working on its successor, C/c
chromosome technology. Unlike its predecessor, it promises to
allow male cross-breeds compatibility with the D chromosome.
It is widely expected this technology will be ready for release
within the next decade.

What is not widely known is that this technology is already
primed for release and has been for years. Geneticists perfected
the C/c combination in 1092 but it has not been released and
there is no intention of doing so in the foreseeable future. The
problem is the development of the human female/c gender.
Many consider c chromosome technology an outstanding
success, but those who developed it consider it a failure with

potential for disaster. It was known the c chromosome would
leak outside Luriani space to some degree and allow a certain
amount of Luriani traits into the human genome. It was thought
these would be almost insignificant. Nevertheless, the Luriani
took the possibility seriously and the decision to release the
technology was taken not by the Luriani, but at the highest
levels of the Imperial government.

The problem with C/c chromosome technology is the genetic
backflow will be much higher than from the existing c chromosome
version; it will take hundreds of years for there to be a significant
build up of Luriani genetic material in the general population,
if it occurs at all, with the current c chromosome technology.
With C/c technology, it is guaranteed to happen, perhaps within
decades. Frantic efforts are underway by both Luriani and
other Imperial scientists hoping to find a way to halt or at least
slow the spread of Luriani genes into the human genome and
surrounding subsectors are being carefully monitored for any
sign of the material. Work on the C/c technology is continuing in
an effort to correct this issue.

The emergence of the human female/c gender also has
one other potential danger; exposing the true secret of c
chromosome technology’s success.

The technology is deliberately misnamed. The genes that cause
Leramiyasin defects are not confined to the sex determining
23 rd chromosome but are spread through the entire genome of
both species. In order to achieve its goal, the technology has to
replace these genes in any genome it comes into contact with,
by aggressively replacing them in the first few divisions after
conception. These altered genes can be passed on to anyone
with a c chromosome ancestor; they are wholly benign and,
because many of the genes being replaced also cause defects
in humans, even beneficial in many cases. Nevertheless,
neither the Imperium nor Luriani believe the general population
would react well to this information.

Bioweapons
The Luriani’s general expertise in genetics would enable
them to create highly effective bioweapons. Their excellence
in reproductive biology means they could (in theory) create
some particularly nasty long term weapons. However, their
experience of the Edtyassos and its continued influence on
their culture has left a deep and abiding revulsion at the very
concept. The circumstances which would lead to any sane
Luriani contemplating or participating in such a thing are almost
unthinkable. Nevertheless, Luriani geneticists do participate in the
development of biowarfare counter measures and most Luriani
local governments maintain formidable defensive capabilities.

# Ships

The Luriani love ships. They used to roam Daramm’s oceans
and have now taken that love into space. The Luriani see ships
not as objects, but as being alive with distinct personalities. A
Luriani will never call a ship ‘it,’ always ‘she’ or ‘her.’ According
to Luriani mythology, ships are a gift from Sesh and they follow
her nature. Luriani myths tell Sesh is a capricious goddess,
playful and free with her favours if treated with care and respect,
mischievous, even malicious, if not. Luriani treat their ships
accordingly.

> [!info]- Excerpt from the Journals of Sara Maval Dame
Wurlana, in Luriani, has three meanings. It can mean wurkabommfishimmlana, a deep explosive charge measuring distance,
or wurjkirefgaranfilana, a deep cup thrown for distance. The Verasti Dtareen call it toss-a-mug, and children play it at parties.
But, in this case, it meant wuryokwinseshasitiyolana, deep sea traveller of great distance, the Wanderers. There were over
thirty Wurlana ships in system, including two sublight ships. It’s very rare to find that many Wurlana in one place at one time.
So, of course, there was a festival. Seshko had insisted we go, as these things only happen every few years, so they’re not to
be missed. It was a riot of noise and colour. The ships were incredible, a mixture of everything imaginable. Imperial, Luriani, a
fair few Vargr, even some, I think, Solomani and Zhodani. All painted in bright outlandish schemes. Seshko said they all meant
something, told what clan they belonged to and the ship’s history; where it’d been, who was on board, and so on. There were
children running everywhere. Luriani love children, but the Wurlana take theirs into space with them. I was trying to haggle
over a necklace when I was knocked on my backside by one of them. About thirteen or fourteen, bright blue and yellow ribbons
tied in his hair and around his wrists.

‘A oi irnisha Wa.’ He looked like he was about to burst into tears.

I smiled back. ‘It’s okay, I’m very sorry too.’

I don’t think he understood. I tried my Luriani ‘A oi vie yoirnisha Lul.’

He looked a little puzzled, laughed, kissed me and sprinted off, ribbons streaming as he ran. I turned to Seshko, to see she
was sniggering too.

‘What?’

‘Well, for a start, he’s not Lul, he’s a teenager so he’s Dailul, then yoirnisha - that means what exactly?’

‘Yes, very, very sorry?’

She chuckled. ‘Nisha, sorry, ginisha, big sorry, yonisha, bigger sorry, irnisha, biggest sorry. If it’s biggest it can’t get any bigger
now can it.’

I shook my head. Sometimes you got the feeling it’d been a bad idea to let a bunch of poets and musicians design a language.
‘So why did he kiss me?’

She burst into laugher and pointed. I looked. He was with a bunch of other boys, and he seemed to be getting a lot of attention.

‘Blue and yellow, Lurdtan. Very, very traditional. You, my honey Sara, are pretty and eminently kissable. Especially for a
fourteen year old boy who’s spent most of his life on a sublight starship...

Luriani ships are designed with four characteristics in mind;
durability, longevity, manoeuvrability and aesthetics. They build
their ships with attention to detail, intending them to be easy to
maintain and repair. A well maintained Luriani ship has a life
measured in centuries. The oldest ship in Imperial service, the
INS Aasidt, is nothing more glamorous than a humble TL11 200
ton courier built by the Luriani. She will celebrate her 2,500th
birthday in 1107. Luriani ships are also superbly agile; during
the Luriani War, Imperial ship quickly learnt never to follow a

Luriani Ship Names
Luriani ship names are taken from all of their heritages; Luriani
ships can be found with Luriani, Terran and Vilani names. Luriani
prefer to name their ships either after people or use adjectives.
Their names will tend to be short, usually only a single word,
and rarely more than two.

![[AMLur-124.jpg|100]]


The Wurlana
The Wurlana are rarely seen
by outsiders. They are the
descendants of the great
raft ships which roamed
Daramm’s oceans. These
wanderers spent their
entire lives on their ships,
only coming ashore for
resupply or repairs. The
Wurlana were the first
Luriani to take to space. It
was the slow wanderings of
their sublight asteroid ships
that built and held together
the loose community of the
Amidaresh. Even with
the coming of jump
drive, the Wurlana
remained most
adapted to the
faster means
of travel and
continued as
before. The
Wurlana
formed
most of the
Luriani’s
fleet in the
war against
the Vilani, their
lifetime spent
in space making
them formidable
opponents. Their
numbers were
savaged by the war
and the Vilani exiled
them. Most of the
survivors fled, often
travelling sublight to find
safety.

The handful who remained
behind kept close to Daramm,
hiding and waiting to come home

Luriani warship into an atmosphere. They are almost always
streamlined (there are exceptions, such as the running mate of
their battleriders, the fleet jump shuttle, usually little more than
an open framework fitted with jump drives) and often feature a
number of enhancements such as variable vector thrusters to
improve their manoeuvrability further. Finally, the Luriani expect
their ships to look good. Luriani ships normally have either a
flattened sphere lifting body or pencil-thin needle hull. They
feature long sweeping curves, elegant wings and control fins.
The 124th fleet’s Siarynee display flight with their graceful Gukhii
fighters performing tight aerobatics is always a great crowd
pleaser on Navy days.

Luriani Designs
The following modifications are used when designing Luriani
ships.

•	 The cost of all components (excluding software) of a Luriani
designed ship is increased by +20%.
•	 The construction time required for Luriani ships is increased
by +20%.
•	 Luriani designs gain a +1 DM to Pilot checks for all
atmospheric operations.
•	 Luriani designs have 1 Hull and Structure point per 40 tons
instead of 1 per 50 tons.
•	 The cost of annual maintenance is reduced by 50% (this is
applied after the 20% increase in the cost of components).
•	 The cost and time required for all repairs is reduced by
20%.
•	 The cost of Luriani spare parts is increased by +20%.
•	 The effects of the Old Ships table on page 136 of the
_Traveller Core Rulebook_ are applied to Luriani designs for
every 20 years of age rather than every 10 years.
•	 Luriani designs may include a Manoeuvre Enhancement.
Every 5% of the hull’s tonnage dedicated to Manoeuvre
Enhancement grants a +1 DM to initiative, allows one extra
dodge and provides a +1 DM to Pilot checks, when engaged
in atmospheric operations. Manoeuvre Enhancement MCr.
0.5 per ton of (MCr. 0.6 after the 20% surcharge for Luriani
designs is applied).

These modifications apply only to Luriani designed ships, not to
standard designs built in Luriani yards.

Parts Availability
Luriani ships require non-standard spare parts manufactured
to the same high quality and standards as their ships. Close to
their homeworlds these parts are commonly available, further
away, locating them becomes difficult. Apply the same modifiers
as Luriani equipment to locate Luriani spare parts away from
their homeworlds. If suitable parts are not available, double
both the cost and time required to reflect the need to fabricate
the correct parts.

again. It was these few that rebuilt the Wurlana culture during
the First Protectorate. These Wurlana still remain, plying the
space lanes in their ships, wandering and trading as they have
always done. A tiny few such as the Lurdtan still even use their
traditional sublight asteroid ships, but most now take advantage
of heavy LCA subsidies and travel in more conventional ships.

The Wurlana are superb spacefarers, born and spending most
of their lives there. Wurlana ships are usually heavily crewed,
for they disdain automation and teach their children how to
operate a ship’s systems. Even for the Luriani, their ships are
renowned for their lifespans, often being many centuries old.
Virtually any design from any period can be found in service
with the Wurlana.

Why DoEsn’t EvEryonE BuilD thEm this Way?
Luriani designs and construction techniques appear to offer significant advantages over standard methods. It is often asked
why all ships are not built using these methods. The answer lays in the reasons why the Luriani build their ships as they do.

In the Luriani’s prehistory, their sea-going vessels had to spend years at sea without access to ports and support facilities,
thus the Luriani’s tradition of durability and longevity evolved. As they spread into space, they took this tradition with them.
After the Vilani conquest, the Luriani were forbidden from building or possessing starships for over a thousand years. When
this was eventually relaxed, the number allowed was still severely restricted. Therefore, again, longevity and durability were
foremost in designs. As a result, they adopted production methods significantly different from those standard at the time.
Far higher quality materials were used, tolerances and specifications were much more stringent, and construction methods
were developed that traded time for precision. Luriani shipbuilding continues to use these different methods, while the
Imperium and surrounding states base their industries on Vilani and Solomani practices. To implement Luriani design and
construction techniques would require rebuilding the Imperium’s entire shipbuilding industry from scratch, the cost of which
would be unimaginable. Nevertheless, these methods have been adopted to some extent. Specialist yards using them can
be found throughout Charted Space, but such ships normally attract a price premium and suffer from the same issues of
parts availability.

Arant-class Ketch (Type KL)
A basic courier intended to move high value passengers and cargo, the _Arant_ -class has its origins in the First Protectorate. The
class shows the classic Luriani design philosophy, a wide flattened sphere forming a lifting body, extensive control surfaces and
short twin tail fins that give good manoeuvrability in an atmosphere. Appearance is carefully considered to make the overall design
aesthetically pleasing. Internally, systems are located for ease of access and maintenance. Theoretically, an Arant can be operated
by a single pilot, but normal crew complement is pilot, astrogator and engineer.

# Encounters

Reactions
The Luriani have long been Imperial citizens and most of their
reactions are similar to those of other Imperial citizens. They
tend to give a little less weight to high social standing, especially
when inherited; an accident of birth does not guarantee respect
amongst the Luriani. By the same token, a title that has been
earned will gather far more respect. Luriani expect people to
be polite, and perceived rudeness, boorishness, and crass
behaviour will elicit a negative response.

> [!info]- Excerpt from the Journals of Sara Maval Dame

‘That is you, my honey, yes?’

‘Yes, and that still gives me the creeps you know.’

She was standing in front of the mirror, I knew she couldn’t
see me. My honey, it’s what she usually called me now,
though I kind of liked it. She turned to face me and used that
disarming smile of hers.

‘I’m sorry, but I can’t exactly turn it off.’

‘It’s okay.’ I did know there really wasn’t much she could do
about it, pressure sense wasn’t like sight, it was just there.

‘So my honey, you think what?’ Her dress was long, her
usual style, split at the side, just a hint of leg but with a deep
plunging back showing off the darker pressure lines there.

‘Gorgeous as usual.’

She looked relived. Seshko didn’t like her body. She’d never
say it directly, but you could tell.

‘It’s the Archduke’s birthday ball. He’ll be there himself, it’s
important.’ She sighed. ‘I do wish the Mother had been a
little more generous with my legs and little less with my
front.’

It was more to herself than me. I laughed. ‘You’re not talking
about the Archduke though are you, yes?’

‘Maybe.’ There was a blush, a genuine blush. ‘I just like to
look my best.’

‘And if a certain young Verasti Dtareen Vebant is there?’

She turned bright red now. The Luriani really do that, all that
extra blood apparently. ‘Oh, maybe, you never know.’

I hugged her. ‘You look perfect, if Ian has eyes, he won’t be
able to take them off you.’

The Luriani Temper
The Luriani are well known for their tempers. They are
frequently thought of as exploding into anger without warning at
the slightest provocation. This is not normally true. It is actually
surprisingly hard to make a Luriani lose their temper. Most
assume minor slights are accidental slips and are fairly tolerant
of people they believe do not know how to behave. Also, a
Luriani will not simply stand around being insulted. For a minor
slight, such as a non-Luriani getting their name wrong, they
will simply provide the correct information and continue. In the
face of repeated slights they will try to remove themselves from
the situation (though forming a negative opinion of the person
concerned). When they do feel slighted, Luriani usually give
warnings and a chance for the offender to apologise gracefully
without losing face. These are subtle and hard to detect. These
warnings are slipped into the normal flow of interaction to allow
the offending party to quickly apologise and for both to pretend
nothing actually happened. If the offending party ignores these
warnings and continues to offend, that is when tempers can be
lost. The following rules are provided for non-player character
Luriani, though players may elect to use them as a guide.

First assign the Luriani a ‘sensitivity’ from 1 to 6. Then assign
a value from 1 to 6 for the offence, indicating the seriousness
of the offence. A minor offence such as repeatedly using the
wrong name or title would be 1, something like calling a Luriani’s
cross-breed wife a hybrid, 6. Then roll 2d6 using both the level
of offence and the Luriani’s sensitivity as a negative DM and
consult the table below. Other modifiers should be applied
according to circumstances.

A Luriani will be more tolerant of someone unfamiliar with their
rules of etiquette or somebody they feel favourable inclined
towards. They will be less tolerant if they suspect the offence
was intentional. Referees should generate additional DM’s as
appropriate. Verasti Dtareen and Mmarislusant characters both
use this table, though Verasti Dtareen receive an additional +1
DM to represent their greater tolerance, and Mmarislusant a
+3 DM.

Modified Roll Result
3 or more Offence believed to be accidental; ignored,
but apply the level of this offence as a DM
to any future rolls (these cumulative DM’s
will keep building up with each repeated
offence)
–2 to 2 Offence is believed to be deliberate; ignored
if an apology is given, otherwise the Luriani
will become angry.
–8 to –3 Become angry
–12 to –9 Challenge to duel
–13 or less Lose control

Note, most Luriani will attempt to remove themselves from a
situation after three or four rolls on this table.

When a Luriani do lose their temper, they will be loud and
demonstrative, leaving the offending party in no doubt about
what they have done wrong. Normally, after a period of yelling,
the Luriani will voluntary remove themselves from the situation.
They will later return and apologise for losing their temper. At
this point they will expect the offending party to make some
apology in return; in Luriani society, any apology requires
another in return. If this is received, the situation will be resolved
and relations will continue normally. The matter will be forgotten
and it is not polite to speak of it again. Sometimes, in the case
of a severe offence, they may demand a duel; this will happen
during the initial outburst. As noted previously, this is not combat
but a test of skills, usually artistic. These duels take some time
to arrange and are a method of forcing both parties to allow
time for tempers to cool. It doesn’t matter who wins a duel as
long as both give their best. Once the duel is completed, again
apologies will be exchanged and the matter forgotten.

While Luriani are quick to take offence, so long as they believe
the slight was accidental, they are equally quick to forgive.
However, the Luriani are capable of holding grudges and not
forgiving offences they believe to be deliberate. The most
famous is their racial grudge against the Vilani which they have
held for thousands of years. A Luriani who feels deliberately
slighted will probably not react with violence. They will usually
break off contact with the offender and simply refuse to have
anything more to do with them. Such a reaction is extremely
hard to overcome. The final stage of Luriani anger is when they
truly do lose control. In this case the Luriani will seem very calm.
Their voice will be flat and their focus entirely on the offence
and offender. It is in this state they become highly unpredictable
and prone to violence. Their strong social manners make these
situations extremely rare, though they can be very dangerous.

saMPle luriani Personalities
Below are a selection of Luriani personalities. These may serve
as patrons, antagonists, encounters or adventure focuses.

Brandon James Caroline Minomoru Fierana
Archduke of Gateway
Known in Imperial protocol as Archduke Brandon Singh
Minomoru of Gateway, Brandon is the first of the sixth dynasty
to hold the title. He also holds the title of Count of Daramm,
though his responsibilities are now usually delegated to his
seneschal. Born on Daramm in 1028, Brandon Count entered
a Vusis relationship with Imelda Fierana Baroness of Secord in

1072. The couple finally matched in 1080 and currently have

three children; Tranian (born 1084), Kamess (born 1086) and
Afira (born 1088), all of whom are being educated on Capital.

of his Domain. It is his even-handed manner, balancing Luriani
sensibilities with the concerns of the wider Domain that is
credited for largely defusing the tensions of the Crisis.

Sara Kimiko Charles Trace Maval Dame
Known in Imperial protocol as Sir Sara Lisanii Trace, Sara
Maval is not Luriani by birth. Born in 1063, she was the first
child and heir to the Count of Toza in the Fornast sector. After
completing her education she elected to conduct her customary
grand tour amongst the Luriani. There, she fell in love with the
culture. Three years after completing her grand tour in 1085
she renounced her claim to the County of Toza and in moved
to Daramm. Sponsored by her friend Seshko Maval, she
was granted residency in 1089. Married to the archaeologist
Eeyrn Inhaleemm in 1091, the couple later entered a full ami
relationship with Maval and her Verasti Dtareen spouse in 1093.
The ami currently has two human sons, one human daughter,
three cross-breed daughters, a Luriani daughter, and three
Luriani sons.

She currently works as the senior liaison between the LCA and
the Luriani Makerite community in their continuing efforts to
preserve the Luriani Makerite culture. She is passionate about
this goal and improving understanding between the Luriani and
wider Imperium, for which she was awarded a knighthood in
the Order of Gateway in 1103. She speaks publicly on these
matters frequently and in her role for the LCA organises many
events to further these aims.

Hasueesa Fas Cesaera Emmvekh Basko
Ruaeti
Hasueesa Basko claims to be nothing more than a humble
Ruaeti (Restaurateur). He is in fact one of the biggest mob
bosses on Daramm. While large scale organised crime is
less common in Luriani society, it is not unknown. Basko has
worked his way up from a lowly leorukh (gang soldier) to irlul
(head boss) of the Reshash criminal clan, involved heavily
in narcotic trafficking, vice and corporate fraud. Luriani mobs
are organised along the lines of an extended family with clear
rules of behaviour. Violence against ‘civilians’ (people outside
a criminal gang) is supposed to be avoided, a code of silence
regarding the police is meant to be observed, and the families
of leorukh killed are supposed to be provided for by their direct
gilul (boss). There is a truce on the two Fools’ Days.

Basko actually does try to ensure his clan follows these rules
and thinks of his subordinates as family. This does not prevent
him from ordering beatings and murders when he feels it is
needed, however. Outside of his role as a crime lord, Basko
is actually a devoted family man and supports a number of
artistic and charitable causes. His goal is to obtain a degree
of legitimate respectability, though this has so far eluded him.
He is a frequent target of OSA investigations, but has thus far
avoided prosecution through a combination of his gang’s code

Though born on Daramm, the Archduke now spends most of his
time at the Domain capital of Annapabar (Ley 1936).

Brandon is best known for his almost single-handed efforts to
defuse the Luriani Crisis in the 1070s. It is considered it was
only his voice of reason which prevented a Luriani revolt when
Archduke Steven made his motion in the Moot to void the Treaty
of Daramm, and it was his frantic (and unauthorised) dash to
Capital and appeal to Emperor Strephon himself that prevented
its passing. He was raised to the position of Archduke in the
wake of the Crisis in 1076. Brandon is known for his hands on
approach to government, taking a direct interest in the welfare

of silence, violence and intimidation. However, he has many
powerful enemies who would love to see him fall.

Ira Wilhem Renal Riasa Riasa Baronet y

Kaashiarfo
In Imperial protocol known as Baronet Ira Ungash Riasa of
Kaashiarfo, Riasa Baronet is CEO and principle shareholder of
Riasa Dtiambasa, an important shipping and trading company in
Luriani space. Born on Sarun in 1031, the future baronet began
his career as a lowly deckhand on a tramp freighter in 1049.
He quickly showed a talent for business and was appointed to
positions of increasing responsibility. He put aside much of his
salary and, in 1061, purchased his own free trader. His talent,
dedication and simple hard work allowed him to expand to a
second in 1073, and his fleet continued to expand for the next
two decades. By 1095, his company was a thriving mid-sized
merchant line specialising in trade between Luriani worlds
and the wider Imperium. He received his Baronetcy in 1099 in
recognition for his role in fostering the economic recovery of
the Luriani worlds after the Crisis of the 1070s. Unusually, his
Baronetcy is not an archducal title, but issued directly from the
Emperor himself.

Riasa is a driven and talent businessman. He is known to drive
a hard bargain and for cut-throat business practices, though
never illegal behaviour. Currently unmatched, his heir is his
grand-niece Aniar. At the insistence of her grand-uncle, Aniar
began her career as a lowly deckhand in 1097 and quickly
showed she had his talent. She is now first mate on one of
the line’s independent trading vessels and rising rapidly in the
company under the watchful eye of her devoted grand-uncle.

Afira Imelda Brandon Minomoru Minomoru

Lady of Gateway
Know in Imperial protocol as the Lady Afira Fierana Minomoru,
she is the youngest child of Brandon Archduke. Born on
Annapabar in 1088, Lady Afira is currently attending the
prestigious Karbiili School on Capital where she is known to be a
problem student. Her behaviour was restrained by the presence
of her brothers Tranian and Kamees, but since they have left
for higher education, her wild nature has become evident.
Rumours persist of her near expulsion after unceremoniously
dumping the heir of a highly ranked noble for a disparaging
comment regarding her gown at a social event (Lady Isis of
Ilelish and Grand Princess Ciencia are frequently mentioned in
relation to this supposed incident, though this seems unlikely).
Despite her disciplinary problems, she excels in her studies of
history, economics and political science. It is known she intends
to follow a career in the navy and is attending preparatory
classes. It is expected she will return to enter the Gateway
Naval Academy after completing her schooling next year.

saMPle luriani Patrons
The patrons listed here employ a mix of Luriani and non-Luriani
characters.

Sharik Diikhu, Conspiracy Theorist and Ama-
teur Art Historian
Requirements: Engineering (electronics), Stealth
Rewards: Cr. 2,000 per party member

Player Information: Sharik Diikhu is a believer in the theories
that Ariaryn Olreel’s works contain visions of the future. She is
convinced she has found a lead which will prove them once and
for all. Much of the mystique around Olreel focuses on his final
five paintings, only one of which (Kwu Aaeri, now hanging in the
Imperial Museum of Art on Capital) is known to survive. These
works are mentioned in the diaries of his eshal, Veraa Jkerles.
Most art historians believe Olreel himself destroyed the works
before his suicide. Jkerles’ diaries disappeared after her death
in a drug overdose in 741. Diikhu believes these works were
not destroyed and the diaries hold the key to their location. Her
research indicates the diaries are held by the noted industrialist
David Suhalanii, and is looking for a party to recover them.

Referee’s Information: Diikhu seems more than a little
obsessed by the legend of Olreel and will increase the reward
by up to Cr. 3,000 per party member, if pushed. The diaries
are supposedly held in the private library of Suhalanii’s rural
estate. Diikhu will be quite insistent the violence be avoided and
will not pay if anyone is seriously injured. She will be able to
provide details of the estates security arrangements and a floor
plan showing the location of the library. In all cases below, the
referee should determine what, if any, information the diaries
contain (it is quite possible they contain nothing useful at all).
However, the diaries are valuable historical documents in their
own right, easily worth tens of thousands of credits to historians
and researchers.

1: All is as it seems, the diaries are in the libraries and can
be recovered. The diaries themselves are written in a slightly
archaic dialect of Standard Luriani. Security at the estate will
be tight and should present a challenge to the party. The diaries
themselves are eight heavy bound volumes and rather bulky to
move.
2: As above, but Suhalanii has extensive contact with the local
criminal community and will not take kindly to having been
robbed. He will actively seek to identity the culprits and place a
Cr. 10,000 contract for the party’s capture and recovery of the
diaries.
3: As in 1, but the diaries have been digitised and are now
stored on Suhalanii’s computer system. The party will need to
crack the security on the computer, then locate and copy the
files.

**4:** As in 1, except Suhalanii is currently hosting a visiting Imperial
Duke. Security arrangements are being handled by the Duke’s
huscarls and will be far tighter than expected. The Duke is in
fact another amateur historian seeking to purchase the diaries.
If the team is successful in stealing them, the Duke will actively
pursue them.
**5:** Diikhu is in fact a jewel thief, intending to use the characters
break-in as cover for her own theft of valuable items from
Suhalanii. The security information she has provided is
inaccurate and, if followed, will lead to the group’s detection in
the library. In this case the diaries do not exist. Diikhu has also
left a trail of evidence implicating the characters in her theft.
**6:** As above, except the diaries are real.

Despi Tosaryn, Luriani Separatist
**Requirements:** Engineering (electronics), Explosives, Stealth
**Rewards:** Cr. 1,000 per party member

**Player Information:** Despi Tosaryn is a student of dance in a
local Luriani artistic academy. He is also a passionate supporter
of Luriani separatism, and wishes to make a radical statement
of his beliefs through art. He and a group of friends are planning
on infiltrating the local naval base during a review by senior
admiralty officials, and perform a dance routine in support of
Luriani independence. He is convinced his performance will
attract widespread media attention and bring the issue of
‘Luriani freedom’ to the public’s notice once more. Tosaryn is
aware of the Luriani’s appreciation of a good dramatic stunt; the
more dramatic the better. While he and his ‘cell’ will perform the
actual stunt, he is looking for technical support. People to run
sound, light and, above all, pyrotechnics.

**Referee’s Information:** A quick background check will reveal
Tosaryn comes from a well-off family and is a talented dance
student. His group consists of himself, his Verasti Dtareen
eeshren Veraa McGoven, his cross-breed sister Liadtee and
three other Luriani students, Tobra Boluiata, Shishee Liskie
and Avaam Ruan. Also included in the group is a young
Mmarislusant Imperial naval ensign Sharik Khashuu. She will
not be taking part in the performance and Tosaryn will insist
her identity is kept secret, to avoid risking her career. He has
obtained passes and identity documents through Khashuu
which will allow both his group and the players access to the
naval base on the day, all the stage equipment required, and a
quantity of fireworks. He wishes the party to sneak these items
onto the base and set them up. He would like the characters
to remain and monitor this equipment during the performance,
and is concerned about the possibility of the fireworks causing
injuries. He will be insistent on no weapons being used. This
is to be a non-violent protest and he wants no risk of anything
going wrong.

1–2. All is as it seems. Tosaryn is charismatic and the rest of his
group appear to defer to his leadership. Most appear equally as
committed to the cause as he does, though it will be apparent
that in Liadtee’s case this is hero worship of an elder brother,
and that Veraa’s main interest is in getting her eshren to commit
to a more formal relationship. The passes and ID papers will get
the party onto the base with ease. However, getting the bulky
sound and light equipment in place, along with a large quantity
of fireworks, may be difficult. The performance itself will go well,
though it will quickly be stopped by Imperial Marines. It will gain
considerable mostly favourable publicity (the Luriani appreciate
a good dramatic stunt) and increase awareness of separatism.
If the players are captured, they will find the Imperium taking a
fairly light-handed response, handing the matter over to local
Luriani authorities who will impose a sentence of 1d6 x 10
hours of community service. The party will however also find
themselves temporary celebrities and, as long as Khashuu’s
identity has been kept secret, receive a +1 DM for all reactions
on world for the next year.
3–4: As above, except the commander of the base is Fleet
Admiral Midori Valdez, a strictly religious Makerite who will take
a dim view of their performance. If the party are captured, they
will face several hours of gruelling interrogation to discover who
their inside contact was. She will also insist the culprits face
Imperial justice. Fortunately, the Imperial Court will also take
a very lenient attitude, having no desire to feed the group’s
existing notoriety. The court will impose a sentence of 2d3
weeks imprisonment. They will still become local celebrities as
long as they have managed to hide Khashuu’s identity.
5: Veraa is actually Gale Akugakii, an anti-Imperial terrorist from
the Sylean Liberation Army. She is planning on using Tosaryn’s
demonstration as a distraction from a bomb attack she and her
cell are planning. In this case, despite Tosaryn’s charisma, it
will quickly become apparent that Veraa is the one directing the
group. Akugakii is good actor, but is not a Verasti Dtareen. There
will be flaws in her performance which may be detectable. Also,
if the characters investigate her supposed background, they
will find discrepancies. Most critically, she will make excuses
not to be present on the day of the protest. If the party does
not stop her, Akugakii’s cell will detonate a bomb, resulting in
considerable casualties. If the party is captured in this case the
Imperium will not be inclined to be light-handed.
6: As above, but the team will be contacted by Shaalur
Williams, an agent of the local OSA. He is aware of Akugakii’s
plans. According to protocol he should have handed over the
information to Imperial Intelligence, but realises this will likely
ruin Tosaryn. He wishes the party to gather sufficient evidence
to arrest Akugakii, hopefully avoiding irreparable damage to
a promising artist’s career. In this case, Williams will provide
access to Imperial databases through the OSA. It should be
noted that Akugakii is a ruthless terrorist and will have no
hesitation in ordering the group eliminated if she feels they pose
a threat to her plans.

Gami Khii, Film Maker
**Requirements:** Combat skills, Security skills; Art (film making)
and Engineering (electronics) advantageous but not essential.
**Rewards:** Cr. 2,000 per person per week

**Player Information:** Gami Khii is a Mmarislusant director
who specialises in producing low budget entertainment for an
Imperial market hungry for salacious holovids dealing in Luriani
stereotypes. He is not particularly well regarded by the Luriani
film making community; he is seen as a populist hack. All the
same, his works find a ready market in the wider Imperium and
he is extremely wealthy. However, Khii has recently encountered
something which has awoken a buried sense of morality in
him. He wishes to bring the plight of a mistreated people to the
public’s attention and is intending to do so through the medium
of film. He is seeking a party to assist with security. He would
prefer a group of non-Luriani but is flexible. He will not be willing
to reveal what the true situation is, but is happy to pay well. He
will stress there are powerful people who do not want this story
told and the work may involve some danger.

**Referee’s Information:** The situation Khii wishes to bring to
the public’s attention is the treatment of the small remaining
non-Luriani community on Arum. He will state clearly he loves
his people, but the same drives and fears which make them
capable of great heroism can also lead them to commit acts of
callous cruelty in the right circumstances. The civil war on Arum
was a nasty vicious affair. The fighting was brutal and there
were atrocities on both sides. The majority of the non-Luriani
human population left in the final stages of the war and most of
the rest were expelled after. However, some still remain. There
are millions of people forced to live in ghettos under shocking
conditions. It is his intention to travel to Arum and document
these people’s suffering. Khii is sure when the wider Luriani
public becomes aware, they will be as horrified as he was and
put a stop to it. Accompanying him on this project are his nuntarri
Heather Sharpee, cameraman Laris Aanee, lighting specialist
Nashu Shadi and sound technician Ora Jamison. Sharpee is a
skilled and successful advocate, and she will deal with any legal
problems. He and these individuals will be making the film, but
help is needed with security.

**1:** All is as it seems. The local government of Arum is unaware
of Khii’s intentions; as far as they know, he is simply scouting
a location for his next tawdry production. All will go well initially,
and the group will indeed find many non-Luriani living in
miserable conditions, with only limited access to employment,
education, healthcare and even basic requirements such
as shelter, sanitation and clean water. Khii and his team will
begin recording these people’s stories. Unfortunately, the local
government will quickly become aware of Khii’s activities and
seek to stop him. This will start with subtle discouragement
and harassment, and escalate from there. After about two
weeks, the government will attempt to bribe the players into

abandoning Khii. They will be approached by an official and
offered a sizeable, though not excessive, sum to leave. Their
response is up to them. If they remain, they will find the situation
turning violent as the government resorts to sabotage and then
outright attacks to stop Khii. The government will stop short of
lethal force, but anything short of that is possible.
2–3: As above, but the adventure will culminate with an attempt
to assassinate Khii as he completes his work.
4–5: As 1 above, but the government has a powerful ally in
the LCA or Imperial government. The party will find themselves
facing threats of deportation, imprisonment and serious Imperial
criminal charges. In this case, the violence and harassment
will begin much sooner. The party will also face continuing
harassment when they leave as pressure is brought on to
prevent Khii from releasing his film.
6: As 2 and 3 above, but the government is aware of Khii’s
intentions even before he arrives. In this case, one of Khii’s
team is actually a government plant. This individual will actively
sabotage the group’s efforts. Film will be erased, equipment
broken and police will arrest interview subjects before the party
arrives to film them. Official harassment and violence will begin
almost as soon as they arrive and the government will attempt
to arrest the entire group on trumped up criminal charges when
they try to leave. Again bribery will be attempted in an effort to
stop Khii. In all cases Khii’s assessment of the wider Luriani
public’s reaction to the situation is accurate. There will be a
huge scandal if Khii’s film is released and widespread calls for
humane treatment of these unfortunate people. The characters
will have made both some powerful allies and enemies in the
process of helping Khii.

Darren Ivenov, Archaeologist
Requirements: Admin, Recon, Survival, Science (archaeology)
useful but not essential.
Rewards: Cr. 500 per person per week retainer plus a lump
sum Cr. 15,000 success-only bonus.

Player Information: Archaeology is a respected and glamorous
profession amongst the Luriani. However, academic rivalry
between popular and successful archaeologists is fierce. Often
the race to publish or discover can be intense. Darren Ivenov is
a well respected and popular archaeologist, is a frequent feature
on holo chat shows, and his books sell extremely well. His face
is instantly recognisable throughout most of the Luriani worlds.
Recently, he has come into the possession of information which
leads him to believe there is an important Diaspora site waiting
to be found on a nearby world (Kimirk/Ley 1909 B77569A–8). It
is known the sublight ships of the Diaspora sometimes stopped
on nearby worlds on their journey to safety and even founded
temporary settlements. The Information in Ivenov’s hands
indicates Kimirk may be the location of one of these. However,
he knows the trader who sold him the location has also had
dealings with his rival, Kigigi Shaiuryn, and fears he is now in a
race with her to find the site.

![[AMLur-157.jpg|200]]
**Referee’s Information:** According to information in Ivenov’s
possession, the site is located in the dense unexplored jungles
near Kimirk’s equator. Ivenov has a group of loyal graduate
and under-graduate students to investigate the site when
discovered, but is looking for a group of experienced explorers
to help him find it. He also wants the team to stay on to provide
support and security after the site has been found. Ivenov will
arrange passage to Kimirk but will expect the group to handle
logistics, with him paying all reasonable expenses. He will
dismiss Shaiuryn as an academic lightweight, more interested
in ‘having posters of herself in various states of undress on the
walls of teenagers bedrooms’ than serious archaeology.

If the characters chose to investigate Shaiuryn, they will find this
assessment incorrect. While not as popular as Ivenov, she is a

well-respected and serious scholar. Her posters are found in
teenage bedrooms (as are Ivenov’s) but she is respectably
dressed in them. The truth is Ivenov and Shaiuryn were lovers
some years ago and it is this affair gone sour that drives the
intensity of their rivalry. Investigations will also uncover that
Shaiuryn has engaged her own party and is about to launch
an expedition to Kimirk herself. Neither Ivenov or Shaiuryn
are above using (or more precisely, requiring those in their
employ to use) ethically dubious methods to delay the other,
but both will avoid anything which may cause serious harm.

1: The site is well hidden and can not be located with an
aerial search. Locating it will require a long and arduous
trek through unexplored jungle. This jungle is home to a
number of large predators, some of which are unknown to
Imperial science. During the trek, it will seem that Ivenov is
more concerned with preventing Shaiuryn from finding the
site than getting there himself. The players will eventually
discover the site first. Shaiuryn will arrive three days later,
taking her loss with somewhat good grace, then retiring from
the mission.
2: As above, except Shaiuryn’s team will find the site first.
Ivenov will, like Shaiuryn, take his defeat with a modicum of
grace and retire. He will not pay the full bonus, but may pay
half with some show of reluctance.
3: The jungle is home to a small and previously unknown lost
TL1 human culture. This tribe regards the site as sacred, and
will actively try to prevent it being desecrated.
4: As in 3, but the tribe will capture Shaiuryn and her party.
Upon learning of this, Ivenov, despite his rivalry, will spare no
effort to rescue her.
5: As in 3. However, the tribe are a previously unknown minor
race native to Kimark. They have evolved from an aggressive
carnivorous pack predator and will view human and Luriani
alike as a food source. This is an important find and Ivenov will
double the group’s bonus.
6: As in 4, except the tribe are Luriani descendants of the
Diaspora. They are a huge find, sufficiently large for Ivenov and
Shaiuryn to put aside their differences and work together. Their
language is a variant of archaic Standard Luriani, essentially
unintelligible without an expert present. In this case, Ivenov will
double the bonus and all players will receive a permanent +1
DM to interactions with Luriani, due to their fame.

# Worlds

Luriani can be found living on almost any world within the
Imperium, but the vast majority live on the 57 worlds of the
former Luriani Protectorate. There are substantial Luriani
minorities on a number of worlds outside this region, usually in

the Ley and adjacent sectors (over 40% of the populations of
both Dirir in Ley and Derri in Fornast are Luriani). Beyond this
range are the occasional Luriani community far from home, and
the scattered worlds founded during the Luriani Diaspora.

Captive Governments
Within the former Luriani Protectorate, a captive government
normally indicates a world either unable or unwilling to organise
its own local government. Such worlds usually contract to the
LCA for the provision of governmental services. Therefore, a
captive government represents a world under the direct control
of the LCA. These governments take the form of a civil service
bureaucracy.

Luriani Demographics
The Luriani population is expanding, rapidly. Birth rates
amongst Luriani have been climbing for well over a century
and the Luriani population is now growing at around 1.5% per
annum. If this rate continues, it is expected that the Luriani
population will reach 112.2 billion by 1130. This has heavily
skewed the Luriani population towards the young, with over half
the population being younger than forty. The Luriani population
is also on the move, as the rate of growth is placing severe
strain on the heavily populated world of Daramm (home to
roughly half of all Luriani), which now has extensive programs
encouraging migration to other worlds. Most of these migrants
move to lower populated Luriani worlds (much of the losses of
the Human Exodus are being made up by this migration). Most
demographers expect this growth and mobility to continue at
least until the second half the century.

The Luriani Economy
While the Luriani Crisis and the associated Human Exodus
created a major depression and at its height in the 1070s
Luriani economic activity had fallen by as much as 35%. The
Luriani economy has been recovering since the 1080s and is
now booming with an annual per capita growth rate of around
2.5%. Despite the ongoing boom, most economists regard the
region’s recovery as incomplete, with as much as 5% surplus
capacity remaining to be absorbed. However, even at this level,
it is well above the Imperial norm. The 57 worlds of the former
Protectorate currently make up only 13% of the Domain of
Gateway’s population, but represent 25% of its industrial and
economic output.

Shi, it had been a popular tourist world a decade ago, but now
was a ghost planet. They called it the Crisis. Whole worlds
were abandoned, almost the entire non-Luriani population
up and left. But that didn’t matter here, there was a simple
grave marker with the name Sakuya Trace, the man who
invented the jump-4 drive. His story was one of the Luriani’s
favourite, countless holodramas, plays, books, operas and
even the odd kamminlu recital had been made about him.
Not because of the technology, that bored most Luriani, but
because it was a love story. Sakuya Trace had been born
an Imperial, he’d fallen in love with a Luriani and defected.
Seshko had made a point of bringing me here.

‘You, my honey, know you’re related to him, yes?’

I’d got so used to their odd way of asking questions I didn’t
even notice it any more. ‘No, related? Really?’

She nodded. ‘Yes, my honey, he was a Makerite too. I spent
hours researching. You’re related.’

She was beaming with excitement, and I wondered how
she’d managed the self control to wait until now.

I smiled. ‘Well that’s something they don’t mention in school.’

She ignored me and ploughed on. ‘And, and my honey,’ this
was obviously about to be something really important. ‘They
had children. My honey, you’ve got family here.’

I chuckled at that; back then a Luriani and a Human couldn’t
have children. But then again you didn’t talk about it. To the
Luriani, that didn’t matter, being family was a lot more than
just an accident of biology, family was everything. I looked
at Seshko, smiling at me, calling me my honey. Hours, she
must have spent, days, finding all this out. I guess she was
right. I did have family here.

**Number of Worlds:** 57
**Total GDP:** MCr. 1,326,192,753.676
**Per Capita Income:** Cr. 17,120


The Guadix Drift subsector has a total population of
11,753,295,230 on 34 worlds, over 88% of whom are Luriani.
Most of the subsector was part of the Second Protectorate and
is covered by the Treaty of Daramm, though most had lost their
Luriani character prior to the Human Exodus. Consequently,
the region suffered heavily during the Exodus and has yet to
recover fully. Many of the worlds have been repopulated by
migrants from the neighbouring Spearhead subsector. Guadix
Drift is home to a number of ambitious colonisation projects,
both under the auspices of the Imperial Ministry of Colonisation
and the LCA, and the region is developing a reputation as a wild
frontier district.

Most non-Luriani worlds are located in the rimward portion of
the subsector and include the Ley sector’s naval depot. These
worlds were also badly effected by the economic depression
of the 1070s and their recovery lags behind the rest of the
subsector. Trade volumes are still below normal and the area
is heavily dependent on Imperial expenditures for employment.
Recovery is being encouraged by the opening of several new
naval and scout bases along with the establishment of a new
X-Boat link from Sarun to Sashi. Despite the reductions in
tensions after the Luriani Crisis, there is still some lingering
resentment on a number of worlds. Outright unrest is rare, but
occasional acts of violence against Luriani are not unheard of.
Most Luriani regard these worlds as Amber travel zones. It is
hoped the general recovery under way will resolve this issues.

## Shi

0914 E66A321–6

Shi is a pleasant world, similar to Daramm in most respects.
Thousands of years ago, during the first Amidaresh, it was
a thriving world with a population of hundreds of millions. It
was one of the final defensive bastions for Daramm during
the Luriani Consolidation War and was subjected to a vicious
assault, bombarded from orbit, its population completely wiped
out by nuclear and crude biological weapons. Shi lay abandoned
until the First Protectorate, when it was decided to re-colonise
the world. The re-colonisation faced some considerable
difficulties. Much like Daramm, 97% of its surface is ocean.
The First Protectorate’s limited productive base prevented the
construction of the archologies which characterise Daramm.
Shi’s population stabilised in the low millions and became a
tourist destination for the inhabitants of the crowded worlds of
Daramm and Shirshagi. It remained an important resort world
known for its pristine natural beauty until the coming of the
Luriani Crisis.

Shi’s economy was totally dependent on tourism, one of the first
industries to suffer during any crisis. The economy collapsed
along with tourist trade, and the majority of the population was
forced to find employment elsewhere. Its population dwindled
down to its current level of several thousand as the resorts
closed. In 1100, an agreement was reached between the
remaining population and the LCA designating the world for re-
colonisation. The intention is to build a number of archologies to
receive these migrants, thus allowing the world’s natural beauty
to be preserved. The expansion of Shi’s starport is expected
to be completed later in the year and construction of the first
archologies is scheduled to begin in 1106. It is confidently
expected Shi will become an important Luriani world over the
next few generations.

I’ll be leaving in a few days. I’ll miss this place. I found I liked the Luriani.

Honestly it was hard not to, they do grow on you. That infectious chuckle of theirs, like some child about to sneak away with an
illicit treat.

I was reading one of Seshko’s history books. The Luriani are passionate about history. My Luriani was fairly good now, but I
encountered a word I didn’t know.

I asked her. ‘Sweetie, I don’t understand this word.’

She looked up. I’d miss her smile. ‘The word would be what, my honey?’

‘This one.’ I showed her. ‘I mean, I know what Edtyassos means, but it’s being used as a verb, and with that tense. The
conjunction, it puts a future action into the past and then negates it in all tenses. What does it mean?’

I’d seen Seshko lose control a few times. Angry; that was a little frightening the first time, but you got to know she’d walk away. In
love; I still remembered poor Ian, I don’t think he knew what hit him. But this was different. She changed, it was like all emotion
drained from her. All except anger, hate and, above all, fear. Her beautiful melodic voice became flat and monotone.

There’s a saying – don’t worry when a Luriani is yelling, worry when he’s not. She wasn’t yelling.

‘It is a verb. It’s not an event, it’s an action, something that was done to us. And the tense means we remember. We are a very
old people, we make a point of it. We remember because if we forget, they will do it again.’

They say the Luriani have no word that can be reliably translated as evil. Twenty six words meaning love, but none meaning evil.

I think they’re wrong.

## Luan

1314 C302653–7

Luan has always been a quiet backwater world off the major
trade routes, dependent on mining and resource processing for
its economy. The world was not as badly hit by the Luriani Crisis
as many in the subsector, with most of its non-Luriani minority
being assimilated into the Verasti Dtareen population over the
period. Thus it avoided the large scale population disruption
which blighted the rest of the subsector. Also the opening of
the planet’s Scout base in 1056 helped to insulate it from the
region’s general decline. Still its dependence on mining and
specialist vacuum industries meant it did not escape unscathed,
with incomes falling as much as 15%. The reviving economy
has reversed this decline as demand for raw materials once
again climbed. Luan is once again a booming mining and
industrial settlement.

Most of Luan’s population lives in a single large underground
settlement that also houses the starport and scout base. Its
inhabitants are for the most part a hardy mix of miners and
independent prospectors. Over 50% of whom are Verasti
Dtareen with around 10% being unassimilated Humans of
mixed descent. As such it is one of the few remaining worlds
with significant non-Luriani minority. Fortunately Luan’s gentle
experience of the Luriani Crisis means there is little tension
between this minority and the Luriani majority. Until recently
the Luan lacked an Imperial noble, the previous Baron of
Luan having been made extinct in the lead up to the Luriani
Crisis. However in 1101, a local industrialist, Samantha Aarynia
received the title in recognition for her actions as head of the
Luan Governing Council which maintained calm haven during
the Crisis.
