In the universe there are countless planets to explore and the best way

to do so is by using a vehicle. Within this book there are rules for creating

your own designs, from primitive chariots and galleys to high technology
grav cars and trains. The variety possible is endless.

Besides rules for designing your own unique models there are over ninety
different vehicles provided within, split into vaious categories. Aircraft,
land vehicles, watercraft, grav vehicles and walkers are all represented
and able to complete any journey a traveller needs to make.

## IINNTRODUCTIONTRODUCTION

Vehicles are an important part of any _Traveller_ game, whether
to explore a new planet, deliver cargo or simply to get from
one destination to another. Different vehicles are required for
different tasks and this book presents you with almost 100
vehicles, from aircraft to watercraft and everything in between.

If you cannot fi nd a vehicle here to suit your needs, you can
use the vehicle design rules to create your own. A blank vehicle
sheet is included at the back of the book that you can use to
design and record the vehicles you create. Although few civilian
vehicles are armed, a weapons section is included but for specifi c
weapon details you will need the _Central Supply Catalogue_.

Please note that some of the civilian vehicles listed in the
_Traveller Core Rulebook_ have been included here, but using
the new design rules there are some minor differences between
them. You can of course still use the original vehicles but we
recommend that you use the versions listed here if you want full
compatibility with this and future books.

The vehicles detailed within this book cover a wide range of
Technology Levels and have been designed for specifi c uses
and tasks. The vehicles are divided into the following sections:

Aircraft
The aircraft section details conventional fl ying vehicles including
gliders, helicopters and planes. Most aircraft have a co–pilot
who can operate sensors, communications and weapons as

required. Aircraft listed here cover TL 2–8. Later fl ying vehicles
use grav technology and are given their own section.

Grav Vehicles
Grav technology becomes available at TL 8. Worlds with this
technology quickly start to adapt most vehicles to use grav
drives for the versatility and speed they provide.

Hybrid Vehicles
Hybrid vehicles are those that have been designed to operate
over multiple types of terrain such as amphibious ATVs and sea
planes. Vehicles listed here cover TL 4–8.

Land Vehicles
This section includes all tracked and wheeled vehicles that drive
along the ground. Vehicles are listed here for a wide range of
applications from TL 1–9.

Walkers
Walkers are land vehicles that move on legs, rather than
wheels or tracks. Civilian walkers are utility vehicles and range
from TL 8–10.

Watercraft
Boats and ships are used throughout the history of most worlds.
A number of vessels for travelling over and underwater are listed
here coving TL 1–9.

## VVEEHICLEHICLE DDEESIGNSIGN

CONCEPTS & DEFINITIONS
By defi nition, a vehicle needs some kind of motive power
(termed a **Power Plant** ) and a means to deliver this power
(termed a **Drive System** ) so the vehicle can move. Some kind
of control system is also necessary for the vehicle to be able to
function. This may or may not include a human operator.

A vehicle must have a **Hull**. This is the body of the vehicle and
includes the hull, axles, wings and other structural features as
well as the vehicle’s outer skin. Other **Components** are fi tted
into the hull as required, which can include weapons, sensors,
communications equipment, crew facilities and cargo space.

Each component built into a vehicle takes up a certain amount
of space. The unit used in this design system is the cubic meter
(M^3 ). A vehicle cannot carry more than its internal volume
allows, unless it is an open structure with items piled up on top
or hanging out of the sides such as motorcycles, air/rafts and
fl atbed trucks.

A vehicle’s hull will have a **Confi guration,** which is often
determined by its intended function. For example, a cargo van
will have a different confi guration to an aircraft or submarine.

A vehicle’s hull will be constructed from whatever **Material** the
designer deems to be most suitable. Generally, higher–tech
materials will be stronger than lower–tech ones, allowing either
a tougher or cheaper vehicle to be built on the same general
confi guration. The material a hull is built from also determines
the vehicle’s mass and Base Armor.

Further design decisions are represented by additional
**Qualities** , which can modify vehicle attributes such as armor
and speed as well as providing seals and coatings.

The size, construction, confi guration and qualities determine the
mass of a vehicle. Most components will also add to a vehicle’s
mass. Mass is used when calculating the speed of a vehicle.

Facings
All vehicles have six facings as follows:

- **Front:** The normal direction of travel.
- **Rear:** The opposite direction to the front. Most vehicles can
    also travel in this direction.
- **Dorsal:** The top surface when the vehicle is the right way
    up in a gravity fi eld.
- **Ventral:** The bottom surface when the vehicle is the right
    way up under gravity.
       - **Right:** The right hand side relative to a person inside the
          vehicle facing forward.
       - **Left:** The left hand side relative to a person inside the
          vehicle facing forward.

Agility
A vehicle’s Agility is used as a DM to Drive and Pilot checks when
performing diffi cult maneuvers as described on page 67 of the
Traveller Core Rulebook. Agility can also be applied as a –DM
to enemy attempts to hit the vehicle if it is attempting to dodge.
A vehicle doing so is treated as moving at maximum speed for
purposes of its own chance to hit an enemy. The vehicle’s drive
system will determine the Base Agility (see page 8) which can
be increased with accessories and design options.

Agility modifi cations add Agility Potential which is converted
into Agility during the fi nal step of the vehicle design (see the
table on page 26 for details). Some vehicle types and design
choices can result in a negative Agility Potential which will give
a negative Agility score; a vehicle with negative Agility can be
given a zero or positive Agility with the right components.

Speed
All vehicles have a Cruising Speed and a Top Speed (see page
26 for calculations). Cruising Speed is reasonably fuel–effi cient
and comfortable. Top Speed is the maximum the vehicle can
manage under ideal conditions. Fuel consumption is doubled
when a vehicle is travelling faster than its Cruising Speed.

Ground vehicles also have an Offroad Speed (see page 26 for
calculations), which is the best speed they can achieve over
rough ground where there is no road. If the ground is very
rough, most vehicles can only crawl along or might not be able
to move at all.

Tech Level
Most design options and components have a listed Technology
Level, which is the lowest TL that the component is available.
The overall TL of a vehicle is usually determined by the highest
TL component used in the design. However, if a vehicle only
has a minimal amount of high–tech components you can give
the vehicle a lower TL if imported parts are available.

Rounding
When designing vehicles some of the calculations can result in
fractional numbers. Where whole numbers are required, always
round up fractions unless otherwise stated. Also note that M^3
remains as a fractional number so no rounding is required.

VVEHICLEEHICLE D DESIGNESIGN

STEP ONE: CAPACITY
Capacity is measured in cubic meters (abbreviated M^3 hereafter).
The shape taken by this volume is not relevant here. For large
components, the shape will be dictated by the shape of the
object. Smaller components or systems made up of many small
components, such as wiring or life support, can be any shape
and are usually dispersed throughout the vehicle.

Capacity refers to the internal volume of the vehicle. 1 M^3
translates to 2/27 of a displacement ton (dTon) in the spacecraft
design system. However, the thickness of a vehicle’s hull and
external components, such as wheels, mean that a vehicle will
take up more space than its internal capacity. If it is necessary
to determine the overall displacement of a vehicle, calculate
displacement as 1 dTon for every 10 M^3 of internal volume the
vehicle has.

This base value for capacity is termed Base M^3 and is used
to determine the cost of many components. Some vehicle
confi gurations can modify the capacity of the vehicle; this
modifi ed value is termed Total M^3. Components that derive their
M^3 cost from the vehicle’s capacity always use the vehicle’s
Base M^3 value.

The Example Vehicles Table indicates the typical size,
confi guration and qualities of standard vehicles. These
examples are just guidelines and there is no reason why a
vehicle cannot be larger or smaller than those listed, or have
different qualities.

Hull and Structure
Once you have determined the vehicle’s Base M^3 you can
calculate the base Hull and Structure values. Hull and Structure
points are described on page 67 of the Traveller Core Rulebook
under ‘Vehicle Damage’.

To calculate the Hull and Structure points simply divide the
vehicle’s Base M^3 by four. Round the result down for the Hull
points and round up for the Structure points. These values can
be further modifi ed by the material, confi guration and qualities
(as detailed in Step Two). The minimum base amount for either
of these values is one.

CAPACITY EXAMPLE
For our example, we will build a small armed van. Using the
example vehicles listed in the table we can see a van of this
size has a Base M^3 of 20 but let us make ours a little bigger
with 26 M^3. We can now calculate the Hull and Structure by
dividing the M^3 by 4 as follows:

Base M^3 : 26
Base Hull: 26 ÷ 4 = 6.5 round down to 6
Base Structure: 26 ÷ 4 = 6.5 round up to 7

VEHICLE DESIGN

STEP TWO: HULL
The vehicle’s hull is broken down into three design options, which are the construction material confi guration, and optional
qualities.

Material
The construction material sets the base mass and cost of the vehicle based on its size. High technology materials give bonuses
to the vehicle’s base Hull and Structure points, whilst less advanced materials will reduce the Hull and Structure. Modifi ers to Hull
and Structure are applied as multipliers to the base values calculated in Step One.

The construction material also determines the vehicle’s Base Armor. Further armor can be added as detailed in Step Four.

Configuration
The confi guration determines the basic shape and function of the vehicle. It modifi es the mass, cost and other attributes of the
vehicle as detailed in the Confi guration Table.

If you are designing an aircraft then you must choose either the Airframe or Super Airframe confi guration. This does not apply to
grav vehicles.

Calculate Hull Cost
The hull cost is determined by taking the vehicle’s Base M^3 and multiplying it by the cost per M^3 of the construction material. Multiply
the result by the cost multipliers for the hull confi guration and any qualities you have added. Cost multipliers can be applied in any
order as the result will be the same.

Qualities
You can now choose any qualities from the Quality Table as required. You can pick as many qualities as you like, or none at all.
Each quality can only be selected once and you can only have one of a given type. For example, Very Rugged can not be combined
with Rugged.

A vehicle of Dispersed Construction is essentially made up of fairly loosely connected blocks of components, such as a watercraft
comprising several rafts, or a very lightly–built grav craft which is not designed to be subject to serious stress. A ‘moon buggy’
or similar vehicle could be built this way.

VVEEHICLEHICLE DDEESIGNSIGN

HULL EXAMPLE
Continuing on from the example in Step One, we will build our van from advanced composites to give it additional Hull and
Structure. We will use the box confi guration to give us our basic van shape and we will add the Rugged add Refl ec Coating
qualities. The van has a Base M^3 of 26 used to calculate the hull cost as follows:

Advanced Composites: 500 x 26 = 13,
Box confi guration: 13,000 x 0.8 = 10,
Refl ec Coating 10,400 x 1.25 = 13,
Rugged: 13,000 x 1.75 = 22,
Cost: Cr. 22,

Next we determine the Total M^3 :
Total M^3 : 26 x 1.2 = 31.
Round up: 32

The Hull and Structure are modifi ed as follows:

Base Hull: 6
Advanced Composites: 6 x 1.25 = 7.
Rugged: 7.5 x 1.1 = 8.
Round up: 9

Base Structure: 7
Advanced Composites: 7 x 1.25 = 8.
Rugged: 8.75 x 1.2 = 10.
Round up: 11

Finally, we make a note of the Base Armor (4) value from the Advanced Composites and the armor modifi ers from the Box
confi guration (0.8) and Refl ec Coating (+5 against lasers). This information will be used in Step Four.

Calculate Total M^3
If the vehicle’s confi guration modifi es the vehicle’s M^3 , multiply the Base M^3 by the M^3 multiplier listed in the Confi guration Table to
get the Total M^3. If the confi guration does not affect the M^3 , the Total M^3 is the same as the Base M^3.

It is important to distinguish between Base M^3 and Total M^3 because all calculations that use a percentage of the vehicle’s M^3 use
the Base M^3 value.

Apply Modifiers
Apply any Hull and Structure modifi ers to the base values calculated in Step One. These modifi ers can be applied in any order (the
outcome will be the same). Once all multipliers have been applied, round up the total. Make a note of any other modifi ers as they
will be used later in the design process.

You now have the basic shape and size of your vehicle. Now you need to give it some propulsion, a crew and add in weapons and
components as required.

VVVEEHICLEEHHIICCLLEE D DDEESIGNESSIIGGNN

**STEP THREE: PROPULSION**

Drive System
A vehicle needs a suitable drive system for the environment it is intended to operate in. A drive system is assumed to be a
complete system containing everything necessary to make the vehicle move, such as transmission, suspension, steering, and
control surfaces.

- Ground vehicles require a fairly hard surface to drive on, with the exception of hover vehicles that can also travel on water and
    similar surfaces.
- Watercraft need a dense fl uid medium (usually water) to fl oat on or move through.
- Flyers require a gas medium (a thin or denser atmosphere) to generate lift.
- Grav vehicles do not need an atmosphere of any kind.
- Lifters are a special type of grav drive. They provide hover capability, allowing the vehicle to move up or down only. Additional
    fl yer drive systems can be used with Lifters to provide motive power. Lifters are most commonly used for static platforms or
    grav trailers.
- Gasbags are a special case. They provide hover capability, allowing the vehicle to move up or down only. Additional fl yer drive
    systems can be used with a gasbag to provide motive power. The capacity of a gasbag craft is based on the capacity of its
    gondola or other containers suitable for carrying people and cargo. The gasbag itself has a much greater volume and is fi lled
    with light gas; it cannot be used for cargo, personnel or components.

- The Water-Based drive system is only suitable for Manual, Animal or Wind powered craft.

The ‘% of Base M^3 column’ represents the amount of internal space taken up by a drive system and its associated components.
Use this value to calculate the M^3 of the drive system as a percentage of the vehicle’s Base M^3. For example, Tracks on a vehicle
with a Base M^3 of 50 would use up 10 M^3 of the vehicle’s capacity (20% of 50 M^3 ).

The ‘Mass per M3’ column is used to determine the mass of the drive system and is calculated from the M^3 it occupies within the
vehicle. The mass of the drive system is calculated by multiplying this value by the M^3 of the drive system.

‘Cost per M3’ is the cost in Credits for the drive system based on the volume it occupies. The cost of the drive system is calculated
by multiplying this value by the M^3 of the drive system. Following on from the previous example, the Tracks would cost Cr. 50,
(Cr. 5,000 x 10 M^3 ).

VEHICLE DESIGN

The vehicle’s Base Speed and Base Agility are used in the fi nal step of the vehicle design and are detailed in Step Seven. For now,
just make a note of these values.

Aircraft are assumed to have a set of wheels or skids to allow them to land and taxi. A fl oatplane replaces wheels with fl oats at no
extra cost but a true ‘fl ying boat’ (see page 91) needs to have the Waterproof quality.

A Walker can have two or more legs as appropriate to its function. Legs take up little room as they are mainly external to the
vehicle’s hull. Only the attachments and control points take up M^3 within the vehicle.

All watercraft powered by engines must have the Water–Driven or Submarine option. The Water–Based drive system should be
used for any watercraft that uses alternate forms of power (such as oars or sails).

Power Plant
A drive system requires something to power it. This design system does not make a distinction between electrical and mechanical
power. It is assumed that generators and electric motors can swap power back and forth as required, and that a suitable means for
power transmission is available as part of the drive system.

Most power plants can be of any size unless otherwise stated, and are allocated in units of M^3 or parts thereof. The more M^3
allocated to the power plant, the greater its power output. The power output is used in Step Seven when calculating the vehicle’s
speed but for now just note the value.

The fuel, power output, mass and cost columns all refer to the M^3
of the power system unless otherwise stated. The fuel column
lists the fuel consumption in litres per hour when the vehicle is
travelling at Cruising Speed (see page 26 for details).

POWER AND FUEL SCALE EFFICIENCY
Larger engines are more effi cient in their use of fuel and in
providing power. One large engine will provide more power
and use less fuel than two engines half its size combined. To
refl ect this the tables at the bottom of the page help calculate
the effi ciency to be had as engine size increases.

WIND POWER
Wind power usually takes the form of sails and works differently
to other types of power plant. The speeds achieved from wind
power will vary depending on the actual wind speed and other
conditions, so the power output is simply an average speed in
regular conditions.

The apparent wind speed (the relative velocity of the wind
relative to the vehicle’s motion) is also an important factor. For
example if a sailing boat is travelling with a direct tail wind at
the same speed as the wind, there will be no power to drive the
vehicle. Likewise, if the ocean current is moving at the same
speed and direction as the wind, the apparent wind speed will
be 0 kph and the vehicle is essentially drifting on the water.

When travelling in a direction against the wind or directly with
the wind, sailing vessels must ‘tack’ in a zig–zag fashion to
ensure that the sails can harness the wind power. This means

that although a sailing vessel might be travelling at a fast speed,
it is not necessarily heading directly towards it destination.

For gaming purposes, you can assume that the above factors
have been taken into consideration and the vehicle’s speed
refl ects changes in the wind and the indirect course the vehicle
must travel. A wind powered vehicle’s Cruising Speed represents
the average speed it can travel at in normal conditions.

Multiple Drives & Power Plants
Some vehicles utilise more than one drive system or power
plant. These vehicles are usually designed to operate on
different terrains or provide alternative power. Some examples
of multi–terrain vehicles include amphibious cars and
submergible planes as detailed in the Hybrid Vehicles chapter.
Multi–powered vehicles might have a separate power plant for
each drive system or carry a backup power plant (such as a
modern sailing boat with a motor).

Hybrid vehicles are designed as normal, calculating the cost
of additional drive systems and power plants as required. For
multiple drive systems, calculate Agility and speed statistics and
then take the average, highest, or list all values as appropriate
to the design. For example, a dirigible (see page 68) uses the
Top Speed of the propeller since the gasbag only provides lift,
whereas a half track (see page 34) would take the average of
the tracked and wheeled speeds. A submergible plane (see
page 94) would list agility and speed values separately as each
drive system operates independently depending on the terrain.

You can also reduce the cost and M^3 of the drive system if
appropriate. For example, a half track vehicle might halve the
cost and M^3 usage of either its tracks or wheels.

If a vehicle has multiple power plants then the vehicle’s speed
must be calculated separately for each one. If the vehicle uses
the combined power then simply total the power output and
fuel consumption.

Trailers
Trailers are vehicles designed to be pulled by another vehicle.
They are designed as normal but have no power plant; they will
usually have a Lifter or Wheels drive system.

When a vehicle is pulling a trailer you will need to recalculate
the vehicle’s speed by adding the trailer’s mass to the mass of
the vehicle. Trailers also have an agility penalty that is applied
to the vehicle pulling it, equal to the trailer’s Base M^3 divided
by 50.

Fuel
Fuel is measured in litres. One litre of fuel occupies 0.001 of a
M^3 , therefore 1,000 litres of fuel takes up 1 M^3. Fuel is stored in
a suitable tank or container, with feed systems and other related
components included in the overall cost of the hull and power
plant. The mass of fuel tankage is 1 kg per litre.

There is no minimum amount of fuel that can be carried but
practicalities suggest that a reasonable amount is needed if the
vehicle is to go anywhere. Fuel consumption assumes that the
drive system is travelling at Cruising Speed (see page 26). Fuel
consumption is doubled when travelling faster than the vehicle’s
Cruising Speed.

STEP FOUR: ARMOR AND WEAPONS
Armor
All vehicles have a Base Armor value determined by the
construction material used for the hull (see page 5). Additional
armor can be added and is normally made of the same material,
but this is not mandatory. Armor protection is abstracted; a
high armor value might indicate very thick armor or it could
indicate spaced layers with reactive panels, for example, the
effect is the same in game terms.

Armor uses up available M^3 and adds to the mass of the
vehicle. The Armor Material Table indicates how much Armor
is added for each 1% of the vehicle’s Base M^3 given over to
armor. Any modifi ers from other design options are applied to
the new total. Partial armor points are rounded down if less
than 0.5 or rounded up if equal to or greater than 0.5.

Adding armor requires strengthening the vehicle’s chassis,
suspension and other components, making the addition of
armor much more than just bolting on some plates. For this
reason the mass cost is more expensive than the hull costs.

PROPULSION EXAMPLE
Installing wheels on our van will use up 2.6 M^3 (10% of 26
M^3 ), have a mass of 260 kg (2.6 x 100) and cost Cr. 2,
(Cr. 1,000 x 2.6 M3).

We will allocate 4 M^3 for an Internal Combustion–7 power
plant. This provides a power output of 64 (4 x 16), has
a mass of 300 kg (4 x 75 kg) and costs Cr. 5,400 (4 x
Cr. 1,350). The fuel consumption of the power plant is 10
litres per hour (4 x 2.5), so a 70 litre fuel tank will give a
running time of 7 hours, weighs 70 kg and will use 0.
M^3 (70 ÷ 1000).

ARMOR EXAMPLE
Following on from the previous example, our van (made from advanced composites) has a Base Armor of 4 and a Base M^3 of

_26. We will allocate 2% of the van’s M_^3 _to additional armor made from Light Alloys. This will use up 0.52 M_^3 _(2% of 26 M_^3 _), has
a mass of 832 kg (0.52 x 1,600), costs Cr. 1,300 (0.52 M_^3 _x 2,500), and gives our vehicle a further 8 points of armor (2 x 4)._

The van now has 12 armor (4 + 8), but because we chose the Box confi guration in Step Two we get an armor multiplier of
0.8. This gives a total of 9.6 armor points, which rounds up to 10. We also added Refl ec Coating which gives a +5 armor
bonus against lasers for a total of 15.

Armor Facing
The armor rating of a vehicle applies to all of its facings, except
for open confi guration vehicles that do not have any armor
on the dorsal facing. If you wish to create a vehicle with more
armor on some faces than it does on others, you can ‘move’
armor points from one facing to another. Only additional
armor points can be moved in this way, Base Armor points
cannot be moved as they represent the intrinsic armor value
of the construction material.

Where armor varies on different facings the values will be listed
in the following order: front, left, right, rear, dorsal and ventral.

For example, we have a vehicle with a Base Armor of 7 and 2%
of its M^3 allocated to armor made from Advanced Composites.
This gives a total of 17 armor points on each facing (7 base

- 10 additional). We will now take all 10 points of additional
armor from the ventral facing and 6 points from the dorsal
facing. We now have 16 points that can be evenly distributed
over the other four facings, adding 4 points to each. This results
in the vehicle having 21 points on the front, rear, left and right
facings (7 base + 10 additional + 4 moved), 11 points on the
dorsal facing (7 base + 4 additional) , and just the base value of
7 points on the ventral facing.

ARMOR–PIERCING ROUNDS
Some artillery weapons perform better against armor than
others. Area effects such as fragmentation from a shell burst
usually have no intrinsic armor–piercing capability. There are
a number of different armor piercing rounds available:

**Semi Armor–Piercing (SAP)** : This effect is uncommon with
artillery weapons. The round ignores a number of points of
armor equal to half the number of damage dice, rounding
down. For example, a weapon doing 9d6 SAP damage ignores
4 points of armor. If the target has less armor than this value,
the excess is wasted.

**Armor–Piercing (AP)** : Ignores a number of points of armor
equal to the number of damage dice. Example: a weapon doing
9d6 AP damage ignores 9 points of armor. If the target has
less armor than this value, the excess is wasted.

**Super Armor–Piercing (Super–AP)** : Ignores a number of
points of armor equal to twice the number of damage dice.
Example: a weapon doing 9d6 AP damage ignores 18 points of
armor. If the target has less armor than this value, the excess
is wasted.

**Ultra Armor–Piercing (Ultra–AP)** : Ignores a number of points
of armor equal to three times the number of damage dice.
Example: a weapon doing 9d6 AP damage ignores 27 points of

armor. If the target has less armor than this value, the excess
is wasted.

Mega Armor–Piercing (Mega–AP) : Ignores a number of
points of armor equal to four times the number of damage
dice. Example: a weapon doing 9d6 AP damage ignores 36
points of armor. If the target has less armor than this value,
the excess is wasted.

Ultimate Armor–Piercing (Ultimate–AP) : Ignores a number
of points of armor equal to fi ve times the number of damage
dice. Example: a weapon doing 9d6 AP damage ignores 45
points of armor. If the target has less armor than this value,
the excess is wasted.

Weapon Mounts
A vehicle can carry weapons either inside its armor (termed
internal weapons) or outside it (external weapons). A tank
gun mounted in an armored turret is considered to be an
internal weapon as a signifi cant part of the weapon (and most
importantly, the operator and any sighting equipment he is
using) is behind armor.

All weapons must be carried on a mount, which can be one of
three types: fi xed traversing, or pop–up. Each weapon mount
must specify the facing it is carried on.

Fixed weapons can only be aimed by pointing the whole craft
and are usually controlled by the driver or pilot. There is no
reason why a guided missile cannot be fi red from a fi xed
mount; what the weapon does after being fi red does not defi ne
the mounting.

Traversing weapons can elevate and traverse to engage targets
in various directions. They can be mounted in a powered turret,
on the arm of a combat walker, or on a manually operated
swivel mount; the principle is much the same in each case.
Traversing mounts can be powered or unpowered as required
at no additional cost.

Pop–up weapons are concealed or protected by armor, but
cannot fi re until they are deployed. Once deployed, the weapon
can engage and will be obvious to any observer. Pop–up
mounts are available for almost any weapon type. For example,
an aircraft might carry its missiles in an internal bay, deploying
them to the ready position when combat begins. Pop–up
weapons can be internal or external depending on their fi ring
position – if the weapon is still protected by armor in the fi ring
position, it is an internal weapon. If it moves outside the armor,
it is an external weapon.

Most weapons can be carried on any sort of mount. The type of
mount used for a weapon will modify the weapon M^3 , mass and
cost as indicated in the Mount Type Table. The multiplier for each
type of mounting that applies is used, and can be calculated in
any order (the result will be the same). For example, a weapon
with a volume of 4 M^3 , carried on an internal pop–up traversing
mount takes up 7.2 M^3 (4 x 1 x 1.2 x 1.5).

A vehicle can also carry one antipersonnel weapon on an
unpowered traversing mount for every 20 M^3 (or part thereof)
of the vehicle’s Base M^3. Weapons added in this manner do
not use up any of the vehicle’s M^3 capacity, but do add to the
vehicle’s mass as normal. The cost is just the price of the
weapon. Weapons added in this manner require a crew member
to operate the weapon, who is exposed outside the vehicle’s
armor while doing so.

Ammunition
The volume required for a projectile weapon includes enough
ammunition for 10 attacks (shots, bursts and so on). Missiles,
rockets and torpedoes only include space for 1 attack. Energy
weapons do not need ammunition.

Additional ammunition stowage requires 20% of the weapon’s
base M^3 and mass per additional 5 attacks or 90% per single
missile, rocket or torpedo. The cost of the ammunition space
is negligible but the ammunition itself must be paid for. It is
assumed that additional ammunition space includes feed
systems and other related components where appropriate.

Weapon Stabilization
Stabilization gear enables a vehicle to fi re its weapons whilst
moving. Any projectile or energy weapon can be stabilized.
Missiles, rockets and torpedoes do not need stabilization. The
gear is located on the mount, except for open mounts where the
gear is located in the hull. Stabilization reduces the penalty for
fi ring on the move; it does not provide any positive bonus.

The effects of movement on fi re are dependent on the
stabilization system in use and are listed in the Stabilization
Table. Apply the appropriate DM to rolls to hit depending on the
stabilization system in place, the vehicle’s speed and whether
or not it is evading. Stabilization gear modifi es the cost and M^3
usage of the weapon it is applied to as indicated in the table.

STEP FIVE: OPTIONAL COMPONENTS
Optional components include sophisticated electronics,
specialist atmospheric gear and anything that is not necessary
to the basic vehicle control but enhances the functionality in
some way.

Sensor Equipment
A sensor system is needed if a vehicle is to be used at high
speeds, otherwise there is a risk of collision or other disaster.
Sensors provide a DM to skill checks in the relevant area. For
example, a character making a navigation check would receive
a bonus if his vehicle had good sensors, as would a pilot trying
to thread his way though misty hills. Sensor DMs also apply to
attempts to detect hostile vehicles and other targets.

Sensors can be used up to double their range but anything
outside the Base Range should not be relied upon for accurate
information. Obviously, a crew member may be able to see
with the naked eye further than his sensors can provide him
with useful information. For example, a driver looking out of the
windscreen of his TL 5 ground car with minimal sensors can see
more than 250m in good light, but in the dark he will be limited
to the range of his sensor system (such as the headlights). The
sensor packages are detailed as follows:

**None** : The vehicle has windows or vision slits but no sensor
equipment or visual assistance; not even lights.

**Minimal** : The vehicle has a minimal set of visual aids or sensors
appropriate to its function such as lights and wipers. This is
enough for a ground car or primitive aircraft but is not suffi cient
for most high–speed craft.

**Basic** : The vehicle has a basic sensor fi t including radar and
thermal imaging/infrared sensors appropriate to the vehicle’s
function. Grav craft and similar high–speed vehicles need at
least a basic sensor fi t if they are to be operated at speed.

**Comprehensive** : A comprehensive sensor fi t includes driver/
pilot aids such as terrain–following radar, inertial navigation

and automatic piloting/route fi nding using an external frame of
reference such as satellites. Sensors are more powerful and
better integrated than the basic version.

Advanced : Advanced sensors include updated and improved
versions of earlier sensor packages. All data is linked into a
processing unit that presents relevant data in the most effi cient
manner possible to avoid overloading the crew with information,
whilst ensuring that they do not miss anything important.

Excellent : Excellent sensors are another step forward in terms
of information gathering, processing and presentation. The
system can ‘learn’ the preferences of a given crew member
and cooperate with them in an active manner. The sensors
themselves are highly advanced with good resolution and
penetrative power. Cooperative data–sharing between vehicles
and ground stations allows a composite viewpoint to be created,
assisting vehicle crews to see ‘behind’ obstructions.

SENSOR UPGRADES
Most sensor packages can use one or more of the following
upgrades that modify the range, M^3 , mass and cost. Any given
sensor package can have only one option that affects range.
Minimal sensors cannot be modifi ed. Range assumes no
obstacles; a 5,000 km strategic radar can ‘see’ 5,000 km in a
straight line or with the aid of satellites, but cannot see through
mountains and planetary curvature.

Hardened sensors are effectively immune to electromagnetic
pulses and some jamming. Any attempt to jam hardened
sensors is subject to a –2 DM. Hardened sensors are used by
exploration vehicles in high–radiation environments as well as
military craft.

Compact sensors represent the miniaturization of technology on
more advanced worlds. The Compact upgrade reduces the size
and mass of the sensors but increases the cost. This upgrade
can be combined with any combination of sensor package and
upgrades.

COMMUNICATION DEVICE EXAMPLE
We will add a TL 7 Radio–100 communications device. This
will use up a further 0.5 M^3 , add 5 kg, and costs Cr. 1,000.

VVVEEHICLEEHHIICCLLEE D DDEESIGNESSIIGGNN

UNDERWATER COMMUNICATION
Conventional methods of communication do not work
underwater, so alternative means must be employed depending
on the technology being used. At TL 4 submarines must be at
periscope depth with raised antennae to communicate by radio.
At TL 7, communication buoys connected via a cable allows
communication from greater depths but the vessel’s speed and
manoeuvrability is limited.

With the introduction of lasers, submarines are able to
communicate with the surface via satellites but this can only
be achieved at shallow depths. Further advances at TL 9
allow direct two–way underwater communication over short
distances.

Environmental Control Systems
Environmental control becomes possible from TL 6 onwards.
Air conditioning can be considered standard and included in
the cost of the hull for TL 6+ vehicles. Dedicated environmental
control systems, essential for working in adverse atmospheric
conditions or underwater, must be purchased separately.

A vehicle that does not have a Sealed hull cannot normally have
any environmental controls other than suits or masks worn by
the riders. However, it is possible to provide a piped air supply
to riders’ helmets. This costs half the M^3 and Credit cost but
requires that the occupants wear suits and helmets at all times.
These must be obtained separately. Notable exceptions to this
rule are overpressure and compressor systems.

Environmental integrity is lost for most vehicles when doors,
canopies and so forth are opened. This applies to sealed
vehicles as well. Most vehicles are too small to carry an airlock.
If airlocks are desired they must be bought as additional
equipment (see page 21).

**Overpressure:** This system allows the vehicle’s interior to be
held at a slightly higher level than outside air pressure. This can

only be done in a thin or standard atmosphere. The vehicle’s
doors and other openings are semi–sealed to keep the pressure
differential from causing leaks. An overpressure system will keep
atmospheric taints, chemical warfare agents and the like out of
the vehicle so long as the doors are not opened. Air is provided
from bottles or drawn in and scrubbed before being compressed
and used. An overpressure system allows a vehicle to operate
in a non–breathable atmosphere such as carbon dioxide. High
(dense atmosphere, or liquids outside) or low (very thin or trace
atmosphere, or vacuum) external pressures will quickly cause
the system to fail.

Basic Life Support: Basic life support provides breathable air
and comfortable temperature conditions for the crew. However,
conditions are not ideal; After 1 day (24 hours), people living
under these conditions begin to become fatigued and a
cumulative DM of –1 is applied to all Skill checks each day after
the fi rst.

Improved Life Support: Improved life support allows much
more comfortable conditions within the vehicle. After 3 days, a
–1 DM is applied to all Skill checks every 3 full days.

Advanced Life Support: Advanced life support allows a
comfortable environment to be maintained indefi nitely.

Hostile Environment Life Support: Allows a vehicle to support
its occupants in hostile environments such as high–radiation
regions and insidious atmospheres. Other systems will break
down quickly under such conditions. Requires a hostile
environment adapted (Advanced Sealed) vehicle.

Intake Compressor: This device allows an internal combustion
engine to operate in a thin, very thin or even trace atmosphere.
In the latter case it requires several hours of compressing gas to
allow one hour of operation. The air must contain oxygen for an
engine to work. Unlike other systems the volume of the intake
compressor is calculated from the power plant M3, not base M3.

STEP SIX: CREW FACILITIES
A minimum of one operator is needed for any vehicle. Large
vehicles usually require additional operators for critical
systems (drive system, power plant, weapons, sensors and
communications). Operators are not required for systems that
are not fundamental to the functioning of the vehicle, such as
airlocks, sleeping space, cargo and fuel.

Each operator requires an operator station, which includes
seating if applicable. Larger crews can have fewer operating
stations with additional work stations as detailed in the Crew
Component Table. Work stations use up less M^3 and mass
than operating stations, representing the economy of scale for
large crews. The mass includes the weight of the operator or
passenger.

Operator functions should be assigned using common sense.
It can be assumed that some operators have a main task but
can handle other odd jobs as necessary. For example, a vehicle
with a big power plant that carries a driver and a gunner. We can
assume that the crew consists of a driver and a gunner, and that

most drive system and power plant functions are controlled by
the driver. Either of them can handle the radio. Larger vehicles
will often have engineers and technicians, either as dedicated
crew or as multifunctional personnel.

Sleeping quarters are not normally required for vehicles
capable of travelling for only a short period of less than 24
hours duration. Vehicles with the ability to travel for longer will
normally be equipped with sleeping facilities.

CALCULATING CREW NUMBERS
The number of crew assigned to a vehicle depends upon its
type and the role of the vehicle. The crew numbers are listed
for each vehicle type, with different numbers being required if
a vehicle is a relatively short ranged aircraft or a long range
airliner, for example.

There is an optimum level of crew, the number required for the
vehicle to operate successfully. However it is possible to reduce
or increase the numbers of crew for each section, although
this will give penalty or bonus to any relevant Skill checks a
crewmember may have to make. Military crews tend to have

VVEEHICLEHICLE DDEESIGNSIGN

when the vehicle is not underway, most often at a specialist
facility (a garage in the case of the car above, for example). this
does not forbid additional crew in roles normally fi lled only in
long haul craft, but they are not a requirement.

Military vehicles are slightly different, with a commander
required for any vehicle expected to be involved in combat
(tanks, armored cars, APCs and so on).

Skeletal levels of crew can operate machinery and do the
required tasks but are considered to fail any skill checks they
would be required to make. A skeletal crew level is considered
to be one half the number of crew required to achieve a –2 DM
to skill checks.

larger than normal crews to allow for casualties or so equipment
can be more easily manned around the clock with no detriment
to performance. Civilian vehicles, on the other hand, tend to
have reduced crew numbers, often in an effort to reduce costs.

The optimum number of crew is calculated using the following
tables. In the case of hybrid vehicles the crew fi gure is taken from
the worst of the available options (an amphibious land vehicle, for
example, might choose crew from either the watercraft or land
tables, always taking the worst fi gure for any given role).

In most cases small, personal ships, aircraft and other vehicles
only require a single crew member, a pilot. Other functions
(such as maintenance/engineering for a motor car) are done

VVEHICLEEHICLE D DESIGNESIGN

CARGO SPACE EXAMPLE
With our design complete the total M^3 used by the vehicle’s
components is 13.54, which leaves 18.46 M^3 remaining from
the Total M^3 of 32. We will allocate all of this to cargo space,
which gives us 1.37 dTons of storage (18.46 ÷ 13.5).

AGILITY EXAMPLE
Wheels have a Base Agility of 0 and Improved Suspension
gives the van +1 Agility Potential. This gives an Agility bonus
of +1, which we add to the Base Agility for a total of 1.

MASS EXAMPLE
The vehicle’s mass is calculated as follows:

Base M^3 : 26
Advanced Composites: 26 x 90 = 2,340
Boxed confi guration: 2,340 x 1 = 2,340
Rugged: 2,340 x 1.15 = 2,691
Components: 2,691 + 3,740 = 6,374
Total (round up): 6,431 kg

**STEP SEVEN:**

**FINAL CALCULATIONS**
Once all the components and equipment have been added
to the vehicle, any space remaining of the Total M^3 can be
converted to cargo space. There is no cost for cargo space,
and the price of racks, shelves and compartments are included
in the hull price. One displacement ton (dTon) is equal to 13.5
M^3 , so a vehicle with 13.5 M^3 devoted to cargo can carry 1 dTon.
Mass is assumed to be 100kg for each M^3 of cargo.

Calculate Mass
Multiply the vehicle’s Base M^3 by the Mass per M^3 of the
construction material (as listed in the Material Table on page
5). Apply any modifi ers from the confi guration and qualities,
and then add the mass of all other components. The result is
the Base Mass of the vehicle in kilograms (kg) and is used to
determine the vehicle’s speed.

CREW EXAMPLE
Our van needs two crewmembers, one driver and one
gunner using a total of 2.5 M^3 (2 x 1.25 M^3 ), and adding
300 kg (2 x 150). There is no cost for the operator stations
and no other facilities are required.

Calculate Agility
Agility is determined by the vehicle’s Base Agility (listed in the
Drive System Table on page 8), which is modifi ed by its Agility
Potential. Total up all Agility Potential points including modifi ers
from the vehicle’s confi guration and other design options. The
Agility Potential Table gives the modifi er to be applied to Base
Agility.

–2 or less –2
–1 –1
00
1+1
2–3 +2
4–6 +3
7–10 +4
11+ +5

Calculate Speed
Multiply the total power output (see page 9) by the Base Speed
(listed in the Drive System Table on page 8). This value is then
divided by the Total Mass to get the vehicle’s power to weight
ratio. The power to weight ratio is then multiplied by the Base
Speed. Now apply any speed modifi ers from the vehicle’s
confi guration and components to get the Top Speed. Partial
speed values are rounded down if less than 0.5 or rounded up
if equal or greater than 0.5.

Once the Top Speed has been determined, the derived speeds
can be calculated as follows:

- Cruising Speed is 75% of the vehicle’s top speed.
- The Offroad Speed of a wheeled vehicle is 15% of its top
    speed, assuming reasonably even ground. Moving more
    slowly may be advisable however. Some design choices
    and accessories will alter this value
- Tracked and walker vehicles have an Offroad Speed equal
    to 50% of their Top Speed, though lower speeds are usually
    advisable in rough terrain.
- With the right modifi cations, it is possible to create a vehicle
    that is faster offroad than on. In this case, take the fastest
    speed as both its Top Speed and Offroad Speed.
- If the vehicle fl oats and has a propulsion that will work on
    water, it may have an amphibious speed. Calculate the
    amphibious speed as if the vehicle has the Water–Based or
    Water–Driven drive system, with a Base Speed of 25 kph.
    Some examples of this can be found in the Hybrid Vehicles
    chapter.
- Aircraft takeoff speeds vary considerably according to
    design. Assume a base takeoff speed of 100 kph plus 1
    kph per 500 kg of the Total Mass, to a maximum of 300 kph.
    For vehicles with a Super Streamlined confi guration, lower
    this speed by 10%.
- The Drive System table on page 8 indicated the maximum
    top speeds allowable for different propulsion methods.

VEHICLE DESIGN

SPEED EXAMPLE
The total power output of the power plant is 64, and the vehicle has a total mass of 6,374 kg. Wheels have a Base Speed of
100 kph, so we can use all these values to calculate our speed as follows:

Power: 64 x 100 = 6,400
Power to weight ratio: 6,400 ÷ 6,431 = 0.995
Speed: 0.995 x 100 = 98.86
Top Speed: 100 kph

75% of Top Speed: 100 x 0.75 = 75
Cruising Speed: 75 kph

15% of Top Speed: 100 x 0.15 = 15
Offroad Speed: 15 kph

Calculate Ground Pressure
For walkers and land vehicles calculate ground pressure by
dividing the weight of the vehicle by the volume in litres (1,000
litres per M^3 ) of the drive system.

If the total is greater than 2.5 then multiply the speeds for the
vehicle by 0.8. If greater than 3 multiply the speeds by 0.6. If

greater than 4 then the vehicle will not be able to move across
country and its speeds will be multiplied by 0.5. If greater than
5 the vehicle is unable to move except on specially prepared,
strengthened ground/roads.

For the purpose of calculating the ground pressure of vehicles
using a walker propulsion system double the volume of the
drive system.

**GRAV CAR**
Grav cars are the vehicle of choice on most worlds with grav technology. Some are designed to look like their ground car
predecessors, but newer designs are more common. With their ability to reach orbit, grav cars have basic life support as standard
to prevent foolish or reckless drivers from driving too high and suffocating.

**GRAV RACER**
Grav racers are small, lightweight and streamlined vehicles designed for optimum speed. With no cargo space and barely enough
room for the driver, grav racers are primarily recreation vehicles. Grav racing is a fast paced sport that is popular on many worlds
but due to the dangers of high speed racing some governments have outlawed such activities.

Racers do not include Performance Tuning as standard but this can be added as detailed on page 21.

**AIRPLANE**
The fi rst aircraft to be used on most worlds are small single winged vehicles powered by a propeller. For the purposes of game
mechanics, there is no difference between monoplanes and biplanes; early designs tend to favor biplanes to increase the vehicle’s
structure, but as technology improves the additional wing is unnecessary and monoplanes become commonplace.

**SKYCAR**
The skycar is a small plane similar in size to a car with short wings and four vectored propellers giving it VTOL capability. There is
only room for one passenger who can also serve as a co–pilot if necessary, either to pilot the vehicle or operate the sensor and
communication equipment. The vehicle can fl y with just two engines making it a safe choice for people who like the convenience of
fl ying but without the risk.
