## Recon

This skill covers all of the elements of the [[CTSkills#Recon]] skill tree, including the [[Stealth]] checks, _except_ calls to [[Notice]].  Recon-centered characters will usually want a high [[Notice]] skill unless they are a [[#Forward Observer]] (which is relatively rare)

### Recon Stunts

#### Survival

Wilderness survival skills.  #TODO

#### Tactics

Tactical planning that allows bonuses on tactical operations. #TODO

#### Forward Observer

Allows [[#Recon]] +2 skill checks for "things out of place" and placement of artillery/orbital fire, negating the need for a [[Notice]] check fore those things.  This is **not** a general-purpose replacement for [[Notice]], though.

A character trained in Recon is able to scout out dangers and spot threats, unusual objects or out of place people.
