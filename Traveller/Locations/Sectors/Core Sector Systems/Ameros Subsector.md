![[TImp-AmerosSubsector.jpg]][[TImp-AmerosSubsector.jpg|Ameros]]
Ameros has two distinctive features: the rimward tail of the extensive Lishun Main, which wends its way through Ameros in serpentine fashion and proceeds into the Shinkan subsector; and the Ameros Rift, a broad stellar gap that most starships cannot cross with a single jump.

The coreward portion of the subsector is dominated by the capital at Khizuun. The Khizuuni see themselves as the rock upon which the Lishun sector breaks and Core begins. To be a world of the Core is to be an extension of Capital as far as the Khizuuni are concerned and they believe that Lishunians must be ‘cleansed’ before entering the hallowed worlds of the Core. Entering at Khizuun – which many Travellers do because of its rich markets and convenient location – foreign starships are reminded that they are no longer in ‘the provinces’ but have entered the proverbial gatehouse of the Emperor. Khizuun’s intrusive planetary navy, whose uniform is intentionally similar to that of the Imperial Navy, attempts to inspect every single ship that enters the realm, despite the impossibility of actually doing so. The Khizuuni are effectively trying to serve as a protective membrane through which visitors might transform themselves into respectable citizens of the Imperium. For their part, Lishunian traders and other visitors see the Khizuuni as a nuisance but not one that is entirely unfamiliar; Lishun is no stranger to authoritarian governments and most just see it as a cost of doing business.

The Imperial Navy’s 69th Fleet is headquartered at Khizuun with squadrons in several other systems and two BatRons semi-permanently stationed at Nimluin. Likewise, the Scout Service maintains a large presence on Khizuun, where they supervise the construction of x-boats, tenders and survey craft for the way station on Gemi.

The intensity of Khizuuni culture has had an effect on many of its neighbors, mostly by making them a little neurotic. There are several worlds with Amber Zone designations in Ameros, many of which suffer from varying degrees of political instability. Like a nosy and vigilant watchdog, Khizuun recklessly intrudes upon their affairs with intelligence agents emplaced throughout the subsector. These agents subvert governments, foster insurgencies and assassinate political opponents in an effort to bring them in line with Khizunni dictates. The High Captain of the Khizuuni Supreme Council has made veiled threats that he might authorise the invasion of some of the subsector’s more troublesome worlds, all for the cause of establishing a safer, more prosperous Imperial order, of course.

While Ameros is an old and long-civilised subsector, it has somehow managed to retain several worlds with virtually unspoiled wildernesses. The frozen water world of Erkiim, the bountiful twilight band of Luuni Miu and the recently opened reserve world of Lagaashin are a few examples. These worlds are popular destinations for tourists provided that they can ignore the invasive presence of the subsector capital.
