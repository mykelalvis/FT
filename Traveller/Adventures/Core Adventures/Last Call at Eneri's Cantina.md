# Introduction

The starport bar is the go-to destination for Travellers seeking information, meeting employers, looking for a place to hang out while their starship is being serviced, or perhaps those who are simply hoping to find a good stiff drink. The starport bar is a place to make connections, find out what is going on in the local region, have conversations with residents and hear rumors, lies and tall tales.

Starport bars range in quality, appeal, location and utility. There are high-end bars that serve the nobility, megacorporate officers and other wealthy citizens; middling bars that serve a range of customers, mostly just average people having a night on the town; along with low-end dive bars with a clientele of losers, criminals and drunks. All can be found at the typical starport but few satisfy all the needs of a Traveller. For that, they must find a Travellers' bar.

Travellers' bars are places where interstellar society comes to meet and greet, find out what is happening in-system, the next star system over or further along the trade main. Travellers are a unique community unto themselves, living as they do 'among the stars'. As such, they tend to gravitate to bars that serve their unique needs and interests.

While regulars at another type of bar might frequent the place on a daily or weekly basis, the cast of characters at a Travellers' bar varies. Traders, adventurers, mercenaries, explorers and other Travellers journey from star-to-star, seeking the next profitable cargo, big score, dream ticket or mystery to solve. The patrons of a bona fide Travellers' bar are accustomed to seeing different faces, mingling with people from foreign star systems and a range of alien species. The transience of the clientele means that 'regulars' vary from week- to-week or month-to-month. Travellers' bars are places where starfarers can be among their own, people from far and wide, whose thirst for adventure has no limit.

Eneri's Cantina at [[Affinity#Affinity Highport|Affinity Highport]] is just such a place. [[Affinity]] ([[Core sector]]  2121, B98A661-B) is on the [[Sylean Main]], the most extensive jump-1 main in all of [[Core Subsector|Core]]. [[Affinity]] is a desirable stopover for Travellers. Its high-quality starport handles a lot of traffic but there always seems to be at least one open docking bay for a ship. [[Affinity]]'s low Law Level and lack of local government have made the world into a place where goods, employment opportunities and information flow freely. Unfortunately, political and economic forces are conspiring to change that, which does not bode well for the future of Eneri's Cantina.

To properly run Last Call at Eneri's Cantina , Referees should establish the importance of the bar to the Travellers beforehand, as described in the [[#On the Rocks|Prologue]]; run a few of the [[#Patron Encounters]] before moving on to [[#Missing Person]]. As the Travellers pass through [[Affinity]], they get to know the cast of characters at the bar. They make friends with [[Zashe]], the proprietor who seems to know who the deal makers are, where the next big score might be had and where to lay low if the Travellers have just gotten into a scrape. The drinks are always good at Eneri's – [[Zashe]] does not skimp on the alcohol – and her cosy little bar should begin to feel like a home away from home after repeated visits. Once Eneri's Cantina becomes a valuable and enjoyable stop for the Travellers, begin the adventure in earnest. When the Travellers find out that their favorite watering hole is in danger of being shut down, they might be more motivated to do what they can to save it.

The plight of Eneri's becomes a microcosm for larger events happening in the region. By standing up for the bar, the Travellers end up fighting to validate their own place in the interstellar community. There are political forces at work that do not value the contributions of the Traveller community and would rather see them replaced by something that can be controlled and to have dissenting voices silenced. Saving the bar becomes a metaphor for saving the role of the Traveller in interstellar society.

## Overview

Last Call at Eneri's Cantina is unusual in that it includes a more demanding prologue than most adventures. Several patron encounters are provided to help familiarize the Travellers with [[Affinity]] and its role on the [[Sylean Main]]. These encounters lead to adventures that might require one or more gaming sessions. The intention is to give the Travellers the sense that [[Affinity]] – and more specifically, Eneri's Cantina – is a useful hub for information, employment and profits to be made. Eneri's becomes a 'home base' of sorts, a place they can return to again-and-again, meeting new patrons, making new contacts and finding new opportunities for adventure each time that they come back.

In the process, the Travellers come to know [[Zashe]] Pamzirma, the proprietor of Eneri's Cantina. Late one evening, as the bar is about to close, [[Zashe]] asks to meet with them. Her adoptive son, [[Calago]], has gone missing on [[Affinity]] and she asks the Travellers to find him. When they find him, he is in a spot of trouble. He has been roughed up by a group of criminals who are just about to finish him off. The Travellers must find a way to save [[Calago]] and then return to Eneri's.

Upon their return, there have been some developments. The government of Ase, which administers [[Affinity]], has begun to crack down on 'rogue elements' at the highport. The Travellers note the increased presence of [[Ase|Asei]] security forces. Tensions are running high. As events unfold, the Travellers are approached by a trio of competing factions, each of which offers them an opportunity to pick a side in the coming conflict. Shortly after, riots break out and the [[Ase|Asei]] security forces lock down the highport.

The events at [[Affinity#Affinity Highport|Affinity Highport]] are being used to validate something called the [[Justice For All Initiative]] , which is being deliberated in the Imperial Moot on [[Capital]]. Should the motion pass, all subsidiary worlds - those rated as 'captive governments' – along the The [[Sylean Main]] would have their Law Levels raised to that of their host worlds. Some worlds readily accept the notion of a more codified and consistent legal structure, while others decry the loss of personal and political freedom.

Holed up at Eneri's while riots rage in the streets, [[Zashe]] introduces the Travellers to Seneschal Betro [[Uivi]]]], a regular at the bar. The seneschal serves the [[Countess Tranard]] of Bendo, who just might  be the key to the crisis. The countess currently holds the proxies to a number of votes in the Moot, which could be used to sway the election one way or the other. If the Travellers can convince her to act, she could turn the tide. After bringing the countess to [[Affinity]] to make their case, the Travellers go to Capital, where the vote is to be held. They find themselves in a position to affect events that might drastically alter the culture, commerce and politics of not just [[Affinity]] but the entire [[Sylean Main]]. At the eye of the storm is [[Affinity#Eneri's Cantina|Eneri's Cantina]].

# Referee's Information

The information in the following sections is for the Referee, some of which might later be made available to the Travellers. Much of this data can be obtained from public information systems, a ship's Library software or by interacting with people at the starport bar or other public venues. Any information the Travellers discover could be out of date, biased or obscured by forces beyond their control. Partial information and misinformation are often stumbling blocks on the road to becoming fully informed. Keep in mind that the process of putting together the pieces of the puzzle can be an enjoyable and fulfilling experience in and of itself.

See

- [[Sylean Main]]
- [[Shaaaki Cluster]], esp [[Shaaaki Cluster#Political Factions]]
- The [[Justice For All Initiative]]

The [[Ase|Asei]] believe the key to their fortunes is development of [[Affinity]] into a bustling trade hub. [[Affinity]] already sees a significant amount of commercial traffic but [[Ase]] believes its potential is virtually untapped. [[Affinity]] has been a free system for most of its history but in 1080 [[Ase]] acquired a controlling interest in the world. [[Ase]] disbanded [[Affinity]]'s army and deployed several brigades of its own for the 'proper defence of the planet'. [[Affinity]] had been a free world with no official government and a low Law Level. [[Ase]] intends to impose a structured and authoritarian approach to governing the world but have run into a few political roadblocks. The people of [[Affinity]] have petitioned the Chant subsector bureaucracy at Vvrin for relief, citing laws that date back to the founding of the Imperium, which guarantee the independence of individual star systems. There is a movement afoot to involve the Moot as well but thus far [[Affinity]] has found few sympathetic voices among the Imperial bureaucracy.

# On the Rocks

As the adventure begins, the Travellers might be visiting [[Affinity]] for the first time, have passing familiarity with the world from a previous visit or two, or they may already be regulars well versed in its culture. Regardless of their previous experiences in the system, they find [[Affinity#Affinity Highport|Affinity Highport]] to be a bustling and chaotic place where there seem to be far more passers-through than permanent residents.

Proceed to [[Affinity#Eneri's Cantina]].

## Patron Encounters

Patron encounters should be played out organically, with the Travellers meeting appropriate patrons after engaging in conversation with denizens of the bar. Word travels quickly at Eneri's, so a group of Travellers who mention that they are traders are soon approached by individuals who know all the latest rumors about where big speculative cargo scores were made, which of the local brokers has product to move, when and where they might find passengers and so on. Likewise, a group of adventurers or mercenaries who announce their professions are likely to be approached by patrons who can provide the latest prospects in their respective lines of work.

Eneri's is a boisterous and social place but deals of all kinds can be made here. If the Travellers gravitate towards shadier businesses – smuggling, claim jumping, fencing stolen goods, that sort of thing – they are directed to the upper floor of the cantina for a more intimate setting.

The culture of Eneri's is a bit different than other bars. While patrons are eager to do business with Travellers, there is a tendency to test the mettle of potential clients before offering them work or sharing trade secrets. [[Affinity]] offers patrons the 'pick of the litter' with a broad range of qualified employees to choose from. Before conversation enters the interview phase, most Travellers are put to one test or another to see if they have the right stuff. To reflect this, each of the patron encounters below features an 'icebreaker', a preliminary interaction used by the patron to determine whether a given Traveller qualifies for the job they need done.

### Speculative Cargo

**Patron** : [[Grufta Sporza]]

**Icebreaker** : 'Casino Corner' on the second floor of Eneri's is where the gamblers hang out. Grufta invites one or more of the Travellers to partake in a hand of Element, which uses a combination of playing cards and domino-like placards in a complex game of chance. For each hand played, have the participating Travellers make a Difficult (10+) Gambler (2D minutes, INT). Multiply the Effect of each check by Cr100 (or more if the Travellers up the check ante) to determine their winnings or losses. After 3 or 4 games, Grufta approaches the Traveller who has either won or lost the most games by an Effect 4+. If the Traveller is a winner, he expresses admiration. If they have lost, he laments their lack of luck. In either case, Grufta says there is a different game of chance that they might consider: speculative trade.

**Opportunity** : _If you like games of chance, then you must play the speculative trade game. I happen to know of a score that you should take._

A free trader from [[Ase]] was recently impounded at [[Affinity#Affinity Highport|Affinity Highport]] by [[Ase|Asei]] security forces for reasons unknown. With no experience in commerce, the [[Ase|Asei]] have emptied its cargo hold, rerouted freight shipments to other ships, found alternative arrangements for passengers who were aboard and are auctioning off its cargo lots. There is an unclaimed five-ton lot of luxury goods that might fetch a high price from a broker Grufta knows on [[Anther]]. He offers to connect the Travellers with the lot if they consent to take it to Anther within the next few days.

**Details** : The deal is legitimate but the cargo is difficult to transport. It consists of rare Sylean liqueurs that must be stored at extremely low temperatures to prevent them from spoiling. Apparently, these spirits must be heated up and consumed within seconds to achieve the desired flavor and effect. Allow the Travellers to purchase the lot as normal but they gain DM+3 to their Broker check when selling it on Anther. Successful delivery gains Grufta as a Contact and local [[Sylean Syndicate]] boss [[Syn To Rei]] as a Rival.

### The Trade Emissary

**Patron** : [[Baroness Bedaan haut-Wyaulia-Ktosi]], Imperial Trade Representative
**Icebreaker** : Some people love a good story, no matter how tall the tale. The baroness is just such a woman .Her business frequently takes her from [[Capital]] through the [[Anther]] Cluster and she always makes a stop at [[Affinity]] to visit Eneri's. Should the Travellers regale her with tales of past adventures – the more outlandish, the better – she extends them an offer. This can be done with good roleplaying or by making a Difficult (10+) Art (performer) or Carouse check (1D hours, SOC). Gain DM+1 for every round of drinks imbibed during the telling of the tale.

**Opportunity** : The baroness recently fired her chief of security and his entire staff after a breach that occurred during a mission to the [[Dingtra subsector]]. She wants to hire a group of security consultants – essentially mercenaries on a security ticket – to escort her to [[Prubisk]], where she is to negotiate permits for a series of subsidized merchant routes in the region. She has heard that the region is plagued by pirates and fears for her safety.

**Details** : It is true that there are pirates in a few of the blighted systems of rimward Chant but the real threat to the baroness' safety is more nefarious. Industrial interests on [[Skeen]] want to maintain the status quo in the region. While they do not currently have their sights set on transportation contracts in [[Prubisk]] or other neighboring systems, they want to reserve the right to develop them on their own schedule. A shadowy cabal of dirty dealers have hired the baroness' former staff to track her movements, thwart her mission, going so far as to eliminate her, if necessary. The Travellers are offered salaries of Cr3000/month for the duration of the junket plus a bonus of Cr100000 upon her safe return to [[Affinity]].

### One Person's Trash is Another's Treasure

**Patron** : Xalmian artist [[Bloqua Altidore]]

**Icebreaker** : The Travellers meet renowned 'temporal artist' Bloqua Altidore at Eneri's, where he engages them in spirited debate on the subject of the arts. What makes the greatest art? Permanence or transience? After soliciting the Travellers' opinions, Altidore plays the contrarian and argues the other side. If the Travellers can convince him otherwise by making a Difficult (10+) Persuade check (1D hours, INT or SOC), he is impressed and requests aid for his latest project.

**Opportunity** : Altidore is planning a new exhibit at Restoration Plaza and requires a centuries-old artefact to serve as the centrepiece. Retrieving the artefact presents some unusual challenges.

**Details** : Five centuries ago, during the Civil War, Marava defeated Usuti in battle, making her the 13th 'Emperor of the Flag'. En route to the battle, Marava marshalled her forces at the outermost gas giant of Shion, three parsecs from [[Capital]]. She was met by one of Usuti's scout squadrons, which her ships defeated, leaving their decimated hulls on the surface of a gas giant moon. The cold temperatures and thick nitrogen atmosphere of the moon has preserved the hulls and their contents for centuries but it is believed that should anyone attempt to move the more perishable items among them, they will dissolve upon contact. If the Travellers can find a way to get to the moon, securely package five tons of preserved artefacts and ship them back to [[Affinity]] intact, he will pay Cr300000. They will also acquire Altidore as a Contact.

### The First Rule of Melee Club

**Patron** : [[Brale Hawthorne]], fight promoter

**Icebreaker** : Every other Sixday night, amateur boxing matches are held in a vacant tenement somewhere in [[Affinity#Affinity Highport|Affinity Highport]]. The quality of the fights varies but the events are well-attended. Tickets are sold the night before, often just outside Eneri's Cantina, usually with a long line of eager fans hoping to obtain a seat. Three or four preliminary bouts are held, followed by a headliner. Betting is allowed, with hundreds of thousands of Credits exchanging hands on a typical fight night.

**Opportunity** : If one or more of the Travellers is skilled in Athletics (endurance) or Melee (unarmed) – both are preferred – they might be recruited to participate in one of the preliminary matches. Participants are lent boxing gear and assigned an opponent. The Traveller's opponent is [[Bruiser Galloway]]. Bruiser is a decent fighter and will pose a challenge for an unskilled opponent. Despite the amateur nature of the fights, they are managed by a professional Referee, most of whom are reasonably fair.

Details : The best fighters are skilled in both Athletics and Melee but Athletics is the most essential skill. The preliminary fights consist of six two-minute rounds. For each round, have the boxers make a Difficult (10+) Athletics (endurance) check. Then make an opposed Melee (unarmed) check (STR), adding the Effect of the Athletics check. Refer to the [[Traveller Core Rulebook#Opposed Checks Effect Results]] table, with the following results:

- Exceptional Success indicates a possible knockout for the winner of the opposed check. Subtract the Effect from the loser's END. If the loser's END drops to zero, a knockout results and the fight is over. Some fighters can survive one knockout punch without going down but few can withstand two. In addition, three points are awarded on the scorecard to the winner of the round.
- Average Success indicates that three points go on the scorecard for the winner of the check and a subtraction of END -2 for the loser of the check.
- Marginal Success results in a draw for that round, which awards each of them one point on the scorecard and a loss of END -1 for both fighters.

![[CA2-50_1476395988.jpg]]
Between rounds, the boxers' trainers give them water, seal their cuts and prepare them for the following round. Have the trainer make a Very Difficult (12+) Leadership check (INT) between each round. Add any positive Effect to the boxer's performance for that round only. The Traveller is awarded Cr1000 for every round fought. The final purse is doubled for the winning boxer, tripled if they knock out their opponent. If the Traveller wins the fight, the crowd cheers them on and they are met by [[Sylean Syndicate]] boss [[Syn To Rei]], who offers to sponsor them in a future fight. In addition to earnings made by the boxers, Travellers may make bets with other members of the crowd. Bets are typically made for Cr100x3D for the preliminary fights and Cr1000x2D for the headliner.

## Rumors and Lies

The patron encounters cover only a small portion of what is happening at [[Affinity#Affinity Highport|Affinity Highport]]. The Travellers can discover rumors and lies by speaking to the various personalities at Eneri's or simply wandering the starport. Have the Travellers make an Average (8+) Carouse or Streetwise check (1D hours, INT) and then roll on the [[#rumors table]], adding (or subtracting) the Effect. An aggregate roll of less than 2 indicates that no useful rumors were discovered.

|  2  | Restaurants, hotels and bars have been feeling the pinch of new duties and fees. Those who have pressed for more information have been told that the Credits are being collected to pay for the enhanced security being provided by [[Ase\|Asei]] forces.                                                                                                             |   
|  3  | A delegation from the [[Cemplas subsector]] recently passed through [[Affinity]] from [[Capital]]. A successful Average (8+) Streetwise check (1D hours, INT) reveals that they were members of the nobility who left in a huff over controversial new laws being proposed in the Moot.                                                                                 | 
|  4  | A new bar has opened on deck 1 of the highport: [[#Rival Bar\|the Fusing Core]]. Rumor has it that it is financed by a planetside Affinitian. Referee's note: Only partially accurate. There is a new bar but it is financed by [[Ase\|Asei]] corporations and is actually on deck 2.                                                                                                 |
|  5  | Portions of the industrial and residential districts on decks 1 and 2 are being converted for unknown purposes. A visit to the renovations sites followed by a Difficult (10+) Investigate check (1D hours, INT) reveals that a barracks and jail are being built.                                                                                                      |
|  6  | The highport is not the only part of [[Affinity]] that seems to be under siege by [[Ase\|Asei]] security forces. Reports from [[Affinity#Kayu]] and [[Affinity#Uan]] – [[Affinity]]'s two major planetside cities – indicate the [[Ase\|Asei]] have established a police presence there as well.                                                                    |
|  7  | Twelve docking bays have been taken up by troop transports dispatched by the 1st Fleet AssaultRon cruiser, Imminent Victory , out of [[Capital]]. A visit to the docks, followed by a successful Difficult (10+) check Language (2D minutes, EDU) reveals most of the troops have [[Ase\|Asei]] accents.                                                              |
|  8  | [[Ase\|Asei]] Commissioner [[Auvin Tradi]] has appointed an Imperial knight, [[Sir Evin Brand]], to perform an 'audit' of Affinitian society. An Average (8+) Streetwise or Investigation check (1D hours, INT) confirms this is the case.  This knight is a member the Order of the [[Sylean Main]], who originate from the [[Shaaaki Cluster]].                      |
|  9  | A shipment of 10 tons of barricades and riot gear recently arrived from Rek-shons. The cargo modules containing the gear are unlabelled but are inadvertently revealed when the seal breaks on one of them, spilling the contents onto the platform.                                                                                                                    |
|  10 | Twenty tons of foodstuffs from the impounded subsidized merchant, Wayward Wanderer , vanished off the docks last week. A successful Difficult (10+) Investigate check (2D hours, INT) reveals the supplies have reappeared among citizens living in the low-end housing district on [[Affinity#Affinity Highport\|Affinity Highport]] deck 1. |
|  11 | A secretive [[Ase\|Asei]] company has leased two buildings in the deck 1 industrial district. A successful Average (8+) Investigate or Streetwise check (1D hours, INT) reveals the corporation is [[Tolvar Remedies]], a pharmaceuticals company. Effect 2+ reveals that Tolvar scientists are researching biochemical applications of [[Affinity]]'s native life forms. |

# Missing Person

The next time the Travellers are in port and stop by at Eneri's for a drink, [[Zashe]] is spending most of her time in the office and has Bug doing the bartending. When she makes an appearance, the Travellers can see that she is under stress for some reason. If pressed, she pours the Travellers a drink on the house and sits down to have a conversation with them.

> _[[Calago]] – my son – has gone missing. He went down the well – the Affinitian term for going planetside – aboard our shuttle, the _[[#Rammiakhiidru]]_, about three days ago and I have not heard from him since. I expected him back the next day after he left and well... I'm worried about him. I can't leave the bar. Bug can't run the business by himself. Do you have time to go down there and look for him?_

[[Zashe]] is on the brink of tears as she begs the Travellers for their help. [[Calago]] is her adopted son. He is a chimera, a lab creation with combined human and Hhkar genes. The Hhkar are reptiloid sophonts from Julian Protectorate space. A sterile hybrid, designed to serve as a soldier in the Star Guard, [[Calago]] escaped from his oppressors and found his way to the [[Core Subsector|Core]] as a youth. [[Zashe]] took him in and he has been loyal to her ever since. He has a knack for getting into trouble but has always found a way to wriggle out of it in the past. [[Zashe]] is concerned that his luck might have run out this time.

[[Zashe]] informs them that [[Calago]] sometimes goes island hopping in the _[[#Rammiakhiidru]]_ and often goes fishing from the _Seaskimmer_ , a two-person airship housed in the shuttle. If the Travellers offer to help, she gives them the transponder and access codes to the _[[#Rammiakhiidru]]_. She warns them to take care. [[Affinity]] has a challenging environment and its islands are called 'transitory' for a reason. If the Travellers have not been down to [[Affinity]] before, they will soon learn for themselves.

## [[Affinity]]

See

- [[Affinity]]
- [[Affinity#The Wild Seas of \[\[Affinity]]]]

Searching for [[Calago]] on the surface of [[Affinity]] is like searching for a needle in a very wet haystack. The planet is immense and almost entirely covered by oceans. Making it more difficult is the interaction between [[Affinity]] and its moons; one cannot rely upon an island chain to be above the surface for very long. Therefore, even if the Travellers locate the _[[#Rammiakhiidru]]_ or pinpoint [[Calago]]'s probable location, either might be submerged by the time they get there, making the search that much more difficult. Combine all this with the planet's extreme weather and rogue waves, and one has a number of factors to deal with.

As luck would have it, _[[#Rammiakhiidru]]_ can be found floating freely near a recently submerged island chain. If the Travellers have access to a starship or small craft, a close-orbit search using the ship's sensors might be able to locate the shuttle, given enough time and effort. Making the search more difficult is the fact that the shuttle is completely powered down and therefore indistinguishable from thousands of other large pieces of flotsam in the ocean. Have the Travellers make a Very Difficult (12+) Electronics (sensors) check (2D+ hours, INT) to find the shuttle. During each attempt, the Travellers are basically crisscrossing the planet, likely experiencing several false positives that turn out to be oceangoing vehicles, seaweed mats and schools of fish. The Travellers may reattempt the sensor sweep as many times as they like. Add the following modifiers for each sweep:

- DM+1 for each subsequent attempt after the first.
- A successful Average (8+) Navigation check (1D hours, EDU) adds DM+1. This is cumulative, with each successful check increasing the DM by +1.
- If the Travellers are using a spacecraft for the search, divide the ship's Thrust by 2 (dropping fractions) and add this as a positive DM.
- Clever Travellers might create a template of the _[[#Rammiakhiidru]]_ for the sensors to look for. The old Vilani shuttle is an obscure model, so a prerequisite check is required. Have them make a Difficult (10+) Engineer (any) check (2Dx10 minutes, EDU) to find the old design with a ship's Library software. Success provides them with a hull template to search for, adding DM+2 to search attempts.

If the Travellers are using a vehicle to search the planet for the _[[#Rammiakhiidru]]_, be sure to note its Range. [[Affinity]] is a vast world with some locations more than 10,000 kilometers from permanent habitations. If the Travellers are not careful, they might become stranded in the ocean and a separate search-and-rescue effort might be required to save them.

|  1  | Lost at sea. A component failure has stranded a fishing vessel hundreds of kilometers from any permanent habitations and they radio the Travellers for help.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

The search takes the Travellers into an unexpected storm, slowing them down and adding 1D hours to their search.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|  3  | False positive. The Travellers' sensors lead them to an abandoned small craft or vehicle that has been anchored to the rocks of a transitory island. Close inspection reveals it is not the _[[#Rammiakhiidru]]_ but appears to have been there for a long time.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|  4  | Rogue wave. The Travellers witness a mammoth rogue wave sweeping across a broad swath of ocean. The high gravity of [[Affinity]] prevents such waves from becoming as tall as they might be on a smaller world but their breadth enables them to sweep over a front of 2D kilometers.                                                                                                                                                                               |
|  5  | Combine events 3 and 4. The Travellers are surprised by a rogue wave while inspecting an abandoned craft. If the Travellers have a lookout in place, they can make an Average (8+) Survival check (EDU) to see the wave coming in time to get back to their craft. Otherwise, they are caught by surprise and must seek refuge within the abandoned craft, a cave or other shelter until the wave passes over.                                                      |
|  6  | Unsanctioned base. The Travellers discover a secret research base lodged into the side of a transitory island. The tides have submerged the base about 20 meters beneath the ocean surface when the Travellers discover it. If they come in for a closer look, a radio operator at the base tersely instructs them to move along, threatening to fire defensive weapons if they do not comply. The base belongs to [[Tolvar Remedies]], an [[Ase\|Asei]] corporation. |

## Finding Rammiakhiidru

If the Travellers are persistent, they eventually find _[[#Rammiakhiidru]]_ floating freely in [[Affinity]]'s seas, thousands of kilometers from the world's two cities. The waves are rough and the shuttle is being buffeted about when they discover it. A fly-by and cursory examination with sensors reveals its engines and power plant are offline. Unless the Travellers have life-detection sensors, they are going to have to get into the water and enter the shuttle through its airlock to find out if anyone is aboard. Unfortunately, _[[#Rammiakhiidru]]_ has been flipped upside down, which makes entry and examination of the craft awkward unless they can get to its bridge, power it on and 'right  the ship', so to speak. Fortunately, the shuttle's airlock is not locked and the Travellers can simply open the outer door, flood the chamber, and then purge the water before entering the shuttle.

Travellers with [[Seafarer]] and [[Athletics]] skill are likely to be accustomed to the rough seas but others might find the experience of being tossed around inside _[[#Rammiakhiidru]]_ a bit nauseating. Travellers in the boarding party must make an Average (8+) [[Seafarer]] (any) or [[Athletics]] (endurance) check to avoid becoming seasick during the operation. Those who fail perform all tasks at DM-2 until they can get the ship started, flip it over and out of the water. Unfortunately, seasickness is not the only impediment. Have them make a Difficult (10+) [[Athletics]] (dexterity) check to avoid being buffeted about inside the shuttle as they move towards the bridge. Failure results in 1D+2 damage from crashing into a bulkhead or being struck by loose objects.

Once they have the shuttle upright and aloft, the Travellers discover that the fuel tanks are about half full, the two-ton docking bay is empty, the ship is in need of maintenance but seems to be working just fine, and – if they have a look at the log – [[Calago]] has left his flight plan up on the display, showing which transitory islands he has recently visited and which ones he had intended to go to next. His last entry shows that he was island hopping in the Jerouse Archipelago, last visiting an island called J-51 about 12 hours before the Travellers made their way down to [[Affinity]]. Based on the ship's diagnostics, _[[#Rammiakhiidru]]_ has floated southward 120 kilometers during that time and was probably flipped by a rogue wave.

![[CA2-50_1476396003.jpg]]

## Making It Look Like an Accident

There are several clues that might lead the Travellers to island J-49, where [[Calago]] is about to meet a rather untimely death. The island was the last one on his itinerary but J-51 was the last one he appears to have visited. At the time of the Travellers' arrival to the Jerouse Archipelago, it is not much of an archipelago at all, with most of the islands submerged by the tides. The only one still above the surface is J-49.

Should they approach J-51 first, now several meters underwater, the Travellers might notice a migrating school of hundreds of ishgipmigeku, rushing towards J-49 to feed before it too is submerged beneath the waves. If the Travellers have already seen the ishgipmigeku in action elsewhere on [[Affinity]], allow them to make a Difficult (10+) Animals (any) or Survival check (EDU) to figure out that the ishgipmigeku seek out transitory islands that are above the surface. They might also be able to find poor [[Calago]] by continuing their aerial search, as long as that search leads them to the archipelago.

When the Travellers arrive, [[Calago]] is being strapped to his personal airship, the Seaskimmer , by two mobsters from the [[Yirsh Poy Syndicate]]. They are attempting to make it look like [[Calago]] got tangled up in his own fishing lines and then inadvertently ascended too quickly aboard the airship. Once in a while, recreational pilots have been known to fall asleep in their airships and are then rapidly carried upward on the trade winds. [[Affinity]]'s dense atmosphere gets considerably thinner a few thousand meters above the ocean surface. Just like divers who surface too quickly from ocean depths, rapid ascents from dense to thin atmosphere can give wayward pilots and their passengers a fatal case of the bends.

The Travellers have the chance to save [[Calago]] if they act quickly. If the two mobsters see the Travellers coming, they prematurely launch the airship, jump into their waiting air/raft and attempt to escape the scene of the crime. However, if the Travellers approach stealthily, they might be able to stop the mobsters before they initiate the launch. This could play out a number of ways, depending on how it begins. The Travellers might be forced to pursue [[Calago]]'s airship before he begins to suffer from rapid depressurization or they could split up to pursue the mobsters as well if they have more than one vehicle. The mobsters' air/raft will be no match for a spacecraft but if the Travellers  pursue in an air/raft of their own, an aerial vehicle-to-vehicle gun fight might ensue, which – while dangerous - could make for an exciting action scene.

Regardless of how it plays out, if the Travellers make the right choices they should end up recovering [[Calago]], after which they can make their triumphant return to [[Affinity#Affinity Highport|Affinity Highport]] where [[Calago]]'s worried mother awaits. Other than being roughed up and nearly killed, [[Calago]] seems no worse for wear but he should really look into paying off his gambling debts to the Syleans.

### Rammiakhiidru

![[CA2-50_1476396011.jpg]]

The _[[#Rammiakhiidru]]_ is a light-framed, surface-to-close-orbit shuttle of obscure Vilani design. The spacecraft, which has been in [[Zashe]]'s family for generations, somehow came into her possession during her youth. She uses it as a conveyance to her planetside residence and often allows [[Calago]] to use it for excursions to the surface or to meet visiting traders at jump points to acquire small shipments of wines and spirits for the cantina. While _[[#Rammiakhiidru]]_ has no thruster plates, it does have artificial gravity and gravitic compensators.

> [!info]+ What Calago was really up to
> As it turns out, [[Calago]] was not on a fishing trip. He went to [[Affinity]] to meet with representatives of [[Tolvar Remedies]], the [[Ase|Asei]] pharmaceuticals company whose hidden research facility the Travellers might have come across [[#Events Table|during their search]]. Tolvar is performing experiments on [[Affinity]]'s native life in an effort to produce chemical compounds, allegedly for industrial purposes.
> An avid fisherman, [[Calago]] knows a lot about the planet's fish species and found out through his contacts that Tolvar was looking for local expertise. [[Calago]] was also hoping to curry favor with the [[Ase|Asei]], who have been making not-so-veiled threats against Eneri's Cantina. Unfortunately, he did not consider that the [[Yirsh Poy Syndicate]] might take advantage of the situation to collect gambling debts from him.

### Seaskimmer

![[CA2-50_1476396014.jpg]]
Seaskimmer is a light deflatable airship, suitable for the transportation of one or two passengers. The airship is equipped with a grapnel/anchoring system that allows the pilot to secure the vehicle to up to three surfaces at a time, keeping it parked in a reasonably stable position, depending on weather conditions. [[Calago]] likes to anchor it to several buoys or seamount surfaces so he can fish [[Affinity]]'s waters.

# Startown Riot

Upon their return to [[Affinity#Affinity Highport|Affinity Highport]] and [[#Eneri's Cantina]], [[Zashe]] is relieved if the Travellers managed to save [[Calago]] and thanks them profusely for saving his life. [[Calago]]'s return means a round of drinks for everyone and a toast to the Travellers.

The mood at the highport has changed considerably in the Travellers' absence. The increased presence of [[Ase|Asei]] security forces on the streets begins to take its toll. The Travellers are stopped at multiple checkpoints as they move between the various districts. Roll on the [[#Encounters]] table for events and encounters.

Things are getting tense at the highport. For decades, [[Affinity]] was administered by [[Ase]] with a light touch. Now, for reasons unknown, [[Ase]] has established a highly visible presence there. The Travellers might note that [[Ase]] is careful to stay outside the boundaries of the docking bays and shipyard. Starports are extraterritorial possessions of the Imperium and not to be impeded upon by local authorities. However, like most Imperial laws, the specifics are vague and there are circumstances under which local military and police forces can be called upon to secure such assets. The Imperial Navy cannot be everywhere at once, after all.

## Jackboots, Peacoats, and Rising Suns

One of the more confusing aspects of Ase's occupation is the mixed presence of [[#^amp|Asei military police ]] and [[#^apmg|paramilitary groups]]. All wear uniforms but unfortunately not the _same_ uniforms. In addition, while their mission is essentially the same, the behaviour and training of the groups is not consistent.

The [[Ase|Asei]] military police are easy to identify. They have dark grey uniforms with distinct insignia for each rank, knee-high leather boots, that are meticulously shined, and they wear long black overcoats when not on patrol. On their lapels, they display the insignia of the [[Ase|Asei]] Army, two red rising suns that look like the upper halves of a pair of Imperial Sunbursts. The [[Ase|Asei]] carry standard armaments; a laser carbine, stunner sidearm and holstered truncheon. When on patrol, they wear poly carapace armor.

[[Affinity]] is Law Level 1, which allows individuals to carry most weapons openly. |

Most of the paramilitaries exhibit some degree of discipline but others abuse their power, using it to bully civilians. Their role is allegedly to help keep the peace but some engage in behaviours that do quite the opposite. The situation on [[Affinity]] is becoming tense, made more so by the fact that many of the 'authorities' put in place do not appear to be authorities at all.

Many have military or police training and the discipline to go along with it but unfortunately there are some bullies and malcontents among them who are looking for a fight. They view their role at [[Affinity#Affinity Highport|Affinity Highport]] as imposing discipline on the rabble.

## Picking Sides

The turbulent events at [[Affinity#Affinity Highport|Affinity Highport]] have everyone on edge. No one is quite sure why [[Ase]] is imposing their will upon the planet after decades of a more hands-off approach but there is little they can do about it.

While Eneri's Cantina continues to be a popular destination for Travellers, much of the talk at the bar revolves around what is going to happen next. [[Affinity]] is accustomed to being a free society with few laws and almost no police or military presence but it is beginning to feel more like Ase, which has a much higher Law Level. Travellers often come to worlds like [[Affinity]] to get away from authoritarian worlds of the sector and many express how disconcerting it is to see this happening here.

By this time, the Travellers have come to develop a bit of a reputation on [[Affinity]]. They have frequented Eneri's Cantina for some time, repeatedly coming back to its welcoming arms between adventures. Their exploits have given them a reputation as competent problem solvers. Over the course of this chapter, they are met by three parties who seek to gain their services:

- The first is the [[Yirsh Poy Syndicate]], whom the Travellers encountered on [[Affinity]] when they rescued [[Calago]]. This encounter is described in A Business Proposal and should occur before the events described in [[#Powderkegs and Matches]].
- The second encounter is with officers of the [[Ase]] security forces and may occur at any time before or after the riot begins but works best if the Travellers pay a visit to the Fusing Core, as described in [[#Rival Bar]].
- The third encounter is with a certain regular at Eneri's Cantina and best played after the riot has broken out and the Travellers have participated in its events. This encounter is described in [[#Last Call at Eneri's Cantina]].

Each of the interested parties wants something different from the Travellers but ultimately all paths lead to a fateful encounter with a noble who holds the key to events transpiring on [[Affinity]]. The Travellers' decision – if they make one at all – should not be made lightly. Unbeknownst to them, their actions might have outsized importance in the future of [[Affinity]] and worlds like it in the sector.

## A Business Proposal

The Travellers are met by Steg and Yattle, two heavies from the [[Yirsh Poy Syndicate]]. These may be the same two individuals who were attempting to kill [[Calago]] if the Travellers did not kill or apprehend them. The encounter can occur on any of the highport's three decks but is more likely to be initiated on deck 1. If the Travellers generally avoid that deck, the initial encounter may occur at Eneri's. Regardless of where  it begins, the heavies request that the Travellers step outside and take a walk for some privacy. Should they resist, the two criminals wait for a chance to corner and kidnap one of the Travellers at an opportune moment later on. The syndicate will not take no for an answer, insisting that the Travellers have an audience with their boss, [[Syn To Rei]].

No matter how the arrangements are made, should they consent to meet with [[Syn To Rei|Syn]] – or be forced to – they are taken to his offices in the industrial district of deck 1. The building is a nondescript warehouse on the outside but has high-tech security and luxury trappings within. As the Travellers are escorted through its dusty, cargo module-filled confines, they are asked to temporarily surrender their weapons and any devices that could be used to make a recording. They might suspect they have been brought there for nefarious purposes but their fears are diminished as they enter a plush office that looks more like it belongs in a megacorporate tower than a cramped highport.

Sitting behind a bulky desk made of an exotic alien wood, [[Syn To Rei|Syn]] welcomes the Travellers and expresses regrets for any misconceptions they might have had about meeting with him. After a brief introduction, he tells them that things are changing on [[Affinity]] whether they like it or not. They can either be a part of that or get steamrolled by it. The [[Yirsh Poy Syndicate]] intends to do the former. Whether or not they succeeded in rescuing [[Calago]], [[Syn To Rei|Syn]] was impressed by their resourcefulness when searching for him on [[Affinity]]. [[Calago]], [[Syn To Rei|Syn]] informs them, owes the syndicate a considerable gambling debt. He refuses to give a specific number but suffice it to say it is enough that killing him to send a message to other would-be deadbeats was deemed necessary.

[[Syn To Rei]] considered sending his heavies to extort [[Zashe]], possibly taking her business as collateral for [[Calago]]'s debts but the independence of the cantina is important to him. [[Syn To Rei|Syn]] values it for many of the same reasons that the Travellers probably do; it is a rich source of information, rumors and contacts and besides, the drinks are good. However, the Travellers' interference with [[Calago]]'s 'untimely demise' on [[Affinity]] has given him other ideas. [[Syn To Rei|Syn]] says the Travellers' actions are the equivalent of taking on [[Calago]]'s debts. The Travellers now owe him. However, paying this debt need not be painful. [[Syn To Rei|Syn]] believes he can collect from them in a way that benefits both parties.

He wants the Travellers to take over [[Affinity#Eneri's Cantina|Eneri's Cantina]]. They need not worry about [[Zashe]]. The syndicate intends to take care of her. She has relatives in the [[Akin Akun]] system where she can start up a new bar, if she likes, and she and [[Calago]] can get a fresh start. [[Syn To Rei|Syn]] offers the Travellers a portion of the revenue from Eneri's, netting them somewhere in the neighborhood of Cr100000 per month. He ultimately does not care whether the bar makes a profit as he intends to use it as part of a money laundering scheme.

If they express interest in the offer, the Travellers might be able to negotiate a higher fee by making a Difficult (10+) Persuade check (INT) but [[Syn To Rei|Syn]] caps it at Cr200000 per month. He urges them to think it over for a few days. [[Syn To Rei|Syn]] then bids them goodbye, has his heavies usher them out of the office and gives them back any weapons and communications devices they were carrying. It should be noted that Syn's office is outfitted with TL12 countersurveillance technology, which suppresses any hidden recording devices the Travellers have if they are of lower Tech Level.

## Rival Bar

In addition to the [[Yirsh Poy Syndicate]], the Travellers have another suitor: Ziroyo Moynawa, proprietor of the Fusing Core, the flashy new bar on deck 2 of the highport. In addition to having established himself as a business owner, Moynawa has secretly been appointed as the future civilian governor of [[Affinity]] by the [[Ase|Asei]] Concordat.

At this stage of the adventure, Moynawa stays 'in the shadows' and does not present himself as a potential patron. He sees the Travellers as representatives of Eneri's Cantina, hence rivals. The Travellers might visit the Fusing Core out of curiosity or as the result of one of the encounters presented at the beginning of this chapter. Instead, Moynawa uses officers of the [[Ase|Asei]] security forces to communicate with them.

The Fusing Core is a raucous place but has a very different culture to Eneri's. Its patrons are mostly offworlders, just like at Eneri's, but the majority are [[Ase|Asei]] citizens who have only recently come to [[Affinity]]: businesspeople, workers and security forces personnel, for the most part. By interacting with the [[Ase|Asei]], the Travellers discover that [[Ase]] has a much more aggressive, chauvinistic and insular culture. As they enter the bar, they are instantly recognized as non-[[Ase|Asei]]. The Travellers might get the sense that something bad is going to happen should they stay too long but any aggression towards them ultimately only amounts to a bit of rude staring and whispered comments behind their backs.

Just when the Travellers have had about enough of the cold shoulder treatment, they are visited at their table or barstools by [[Sargeant Tolian Muray]] of the [[Ase|Asei]] military police. She orders the group a round of drinks – the [[#^housespecial|house special]] as it were – and asks if she can sit with them. Muray apologises for the less-than-welcoming attitude of her cohorts but expresses a desire to extend a proverbial olive branch. She knows they frequent Eneri's, which has a distinctly different feel than 'the [[Core Subsector|Core]]' but hopes they will give the new bar a chance to win them over. After a brief conversation, Muray stands up from her chair and bids the group a curt farewell with a parting comment: ' _We will be in touch with you soon. [[Ase]] needs people like you. Good luck_ .'

## Powderkegs and Matches

No one is quite sure how it gets started but something drives the [[Ase|Asei]] security forces over the edge: A protest that goes too far, a provocative graffiti display, a stone thrown... or perhaps some combination of the above.

Whatever the cause, tensions between the security forces and the people of [[Affinity]] overflow a few days after the Travellers' return from the planet.

Riots break out on every level of the highport, resulting in the destruction of property, violence in the streets and ultimately the declaration of martial law, shutting down access to the starport to outsiders and preventing those within from leaving.

The [[#^amp|\[\[Ase|Asei]] military police]] immediately move to protect the primary assets of the highport; the docking bays and shipyard. This leaves them very thin elsewhere, which means the paramilitaries end up in jobs they are sorely undertrained to do; quell the riots, secure the startown and see to the safety of its citizens.

The majority of the paramilitaries develop a siege mentality: us versus them. They quickly lose sight of the fact that their primary job is to keep the peace, not contribute to the chaos. Without the more disciplined guidance of the military police, many encounters with the paramilitaries degrade into violent conflicts, some of which risk escalating into shootouts unless cooler heads prevail. This is where the Travellers come in. Events related to the riot are happening on all three decks. The Travellers find out about them by being present or hearing about them from the people they know at Eneri's Cantina.

> [!info]- THE HOUSE SPECIAL ^housespecial
> Travellers who drink the house special inadvertently imbibe a tracer, manufactured by Tolvar Remedies, an [[Ase|Asei]] pharmaceuticals corporation. The Travellers might have found one of Tolvar's unsanctioned research facilities on one of the transitory islands of [[Affinity]] when they were searching for [[Calago]].
>
> The tracer is a harmless, genetically engineered bacterium that lodges itself in the drinker's gut biome. The radioisotope emitted by the bacteria can be used to trace the whereabouts of its carrier to a range of one kilometer for a duration of 30 days before the immune system identifies and purges it.

| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Deck 1   | Several dozen unarmed citizens are desperately attempting to leave the highport via the shuttle port. The shuttle operates like a bus service, transporting passengers between the Highport and [[Affinity]]'s two undersea cities but the military police have shut it down. This is one of the few spots where military police and paramilitaries are working in concert. The military police are focused on protecting property, while the paramilitaries are managing crowd control, a job for which they are ill suited. If the Travellers do not get involved, innocent people might get hurt. |
| Deck 2   | The military police are focused on defending the shipyard and starship service section from rioters and looters. Paramilitaries are milling about, firing upon suspected looters with little regard for innocent bystanders. The Travellers are caught in the middle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Deck 3   | The starport docking bays and upper-level shipyard have been secured by the military police and Restoration Plaza has been shut down by the paramilitaries, who have posted patrols on its periphery. This does not sit well with the rank-and-file Affinitians who are accustomed to having free reign of the plaza and park. Many paramilitaries see Eneri's Cantina as part of the problem and some are threatening to shut down the bar by force. [[Zashe]] contacts the Travellers to let them know things are getting hot and that she needs their help.                                       |

The Travellers have options as the riot unfolds.

•  They can sit tight at Eneri's or another location and avoid becoming involved.
•  They can localise their efforts to a single deck, probably deck 3 since that is where Eneri's is.
•  They can rove about between the decks, dodging patrols and getting involved in multiple situations.

There is no one way to handle the situation but their choices will affect the outcome. The more they become involved in the events on each deck, the more notoriety they acquire with the [[Ase|Asei]] security forces. The Travellers may antagonise the security forces, help them re-establish the peace, or both, but ultimatelytheir actions affect how they are perceived after the riot. Use the following guidelines to calculate a total DM based on the Travellers' actions:

| Action                                            | Result                                                    |                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Antagonise or attack [[Ase                        | Asei]] security forces, loot or aid and abet the looters. | Apply DM-2 for each deck the Travellers are involved in one of these activities. |
| Aid the locals without interacting with the [[Ase | Asei]] security forces.                                   | Apply DM+1 for each deck the Travellers are involved in one of these activities. |
| Assist the [[Ase                                  | Asei]] security forces to restore the peace.              | Apply DM+2 for each deck the Travellers are involved in one of these activities. |
| Avoid involvement.                                | Apply DM+0 for each deck where they avoid involvement.    |                                                                                  |

The total DM is used for all post-riot interactions with the [[Ase|Asei]] security forces. For example, if the Travellers go to deck 1 and participate with the rioters, either looting, antagonising or attacking the security forces, they incur DM-2. They move up to deck 2 and take a different approach, working with the paramilitaries to round up troublemakers, whom they take down to the jail on deck 3, incurring DM+1. On deck 3, they avoid the conflagration at Restoration Plaza and make their way to sanctuary at Eneri's, incurring DM+0. After the riots are quelled, the Travellers total modifier for interactions with [[Ase|Asei]] security forces is DM-1.

## Public Service Announcement

The highport is in a shambles the morning after the riots. The entire facility remains in lockdown with no civilians allowed in or out. The [[Ase|Asei]] security forces have been defending key assets: the docking bays, shipyard and shuttle port. Without the protection of the military police, many businesses and residential complexes have been damaged, some even burned to the ground. With the starport's primary assets secured, the military police have moved into Restoration Plaza, where they establish a makeshift headquarters. [[Commandant Perry]] of the security forces taps into the highport public announcement system and says the following:

> "Order has been restored to [[Affinity#Affinity Highport|Affinity Highport]]. All citizens should remain in their homes or places of business until further notice. By executive order, the highport is now under the provisional authority of the [[Ase|Asei]] security forces. This facility shall remain under martial law until further notice."

Overnight, an additional company of [[Ase|Asei]] military police arrives to help those already present to impose martial law. [[Affinity#Affinity Highport|Affinity Highport]] has effectively been interdicted. Their first order of business is to begin dismantling Restoration Plaza. The [[Ase|Asei]] claim that it is a 'den of iniquity', a place where 'lies flourish and insurrection mounts'. [[Zashe]] fears that Eneri's Cantina - a place where free speech and the exchange of ideas is honored – is next on the list to be shut down, dismantled and erased from the highport.

![[CA2-50_1476396022.jpg]]

## Last Call at Eneri's Cantina

At some point during the night of the riot or in the small hours of the morning, the Travellers make their way back to Eneri's. If they do not voluntarily go, then one of the regulars at Eneri's, a friend or former patron, seeks them out and requests that they come to the bar.

The front windows are boarded up but the doors are open. Bug and [[Calago]] (or perhaps Bruiser Galloway) guard the entrance, vetting patrons to ensure that no troublemakers get in. Several tables have been set aside for a small cadre of volunteer medics who have set up a makeshift triage center where they treat a dozen or so patients wounded in the riots. A freelance journalist from the Traveller News Service is present, interviewing people about their experiences during the riot. [[Zashe]], sleepless and exhausted, serves coffee and other beverages to a few patrons, all of them regulars of the bar. She motions the Travellers over and offers them food and drink.

After the Travellers settle in, [[Zashe]] introduces them to Seneschal Betro [[#Uivi]], a familiar face at Eneri's but a person they have not yet had the opportunity to meet. [[#Uivi]] is the seneschal of [[Countess Tranard|Countess Vandia Tranard of Bendo]]. As the seneschal of a countess, [[#Uivi]] is politically connected and has unique insight about what is happening at [[Affinity#Affinity Highport|Affinity Highport]]. The proliferation of news and information has been blocked so no one has the latest information but [[#Uivi]] informs the Travellers about the [[Justice For All Initiative]] (see page 3), currently being deliberated in the Moot.

[[#Uivi]] explains that [[Ase]] hopes to set new legal standards in order to control the worlds of the [[Sylean Main]]. He believes it will not end there. Trade and travel between the stars is the next objective. While the Imperium guarantees free trade between its worlds, it also guarantees their security. By hypothesising that the security of the Imperium is threatened by so-called 'lawless worlds', the [[Ase|Asei]] have brought into question whether free trade and travel can be allowed to continue in their current form. Presumably, he says, the 'appearance' of free trade and transit will be maintained; however, those who engage in it will have to register their ships, pay new duties and taxes, and abide by the rules of a new bureaucracy, one originating not from [[Capital]] but from Ase, which stands to profit greatly from this new paradigm. [[#Uivi]] points out that [[Affinity]] is not the only world being affected. He has heard rumors that all along the [[Sylean Main]], similar actions are being taken against other subsidiary worlds.

Despite all the doom and gloom, [[#Uivi]] informs the Travellers that the initiative is not popular. It might not pass in the Moot, although he believes that [[Ase]] currently has the votes. However, the [[Countess Tranard|Countess of Bendo]] has access to a large voting bloc. She owns not just Bendo's vote but also the proxies for many of the other fiefs in the Cemplas subsector. The countess rarely travels to Capital, so her votes are almost never counted. If the Travellers speak to the countess, they might be able to convince her to exercise her votes. The bloc she controls would likely be enough to defeat [[Justice For All Initiative]] and force [[Ase]] to recall its security forces.

[[#Uivi]] is willing to go to [[Tertha]] with the Travellers to seek out the countess but he came to [[Affinity]] on a high passage and does not have access to a ship. The Travellers must find a way to escape [[Affinity#Affinity Highport|Affinity Highport]].

## Escape from Affinity Highport

If the Travellers intend to go to Tertha, they must first find a way to escape [[Affinity#Affinity Highport|Affinity Highport]]. While the [[Ase|Asei]] security forces have proven to be less than perfectly competent, they have imposed martial law at the starport, so getting out is no easy task. Ships that have jumped into the [[Affinity]] system are still being allowed to use basic services – refuelling, service and maintenance, and so on – but their crews are not being allowed to enter the remainder of the starport and residents and visitors are only being given access to visiting ships on a case-by-case basis.

If the Travellers assisted the [[Ase|Asei]] security forces during the riot, they might be able to secure passage offworld simply by asking for permission. They can make an appointment with [[Sargeant Tolian Muray]] if they met her at the Fusing Core or with [[Commandant Perry]], the head of the security forces. Have them to make a Difficult (10+) Admin check (1D hours, INT) to obtain an exemption from the lockdown. Success indicates they are allowed to leave [[Affinity]], either aboard their own ship or one on which they have obtained passage. In either case, they are guided to 10 planetary diameters under escort from an [[Ase|Asei]] patrol corvette. Failure indicates that their request has been denied and they must find another way out.

If the Travellers did not assist the [[Ase|Asei]] security forces during the riot, they might still be able to obtain an exemption. However, this requires deception or a bribe made to the right person. Allow the Travellers to create a fiction that necessitates their departure from the highport – perhaps a medical or diplomatic emergency of some sort – and then make a Difficult (10+) Deception check (INT) opposed by an INT check from the officer they are attempting to deceive. Success gains them an exemption. Failure results in immediate arrest and detention in the jail on deck 1. Alternatively, the Travellers may figure out whom to bribe – possibly a corporal or other low-level officer in the security forces – by making a successful Difficult (10+) Investigate check (1D hours, INT), followed by a Difficult (10+) Persuade check (SOC) to place the bribe. A reasonable bribe is Cr500–1000. Again, success results in receipt of an exemption and failure results in jail time.

There are other ways to get offworld as well, limited only by the Travellers' imaginations. The Referee should reward creativity and assign the appropriate checks or task chains to resolve any intricate plans the Travellers think up. Donning vacc suits to secretly spacewalk to a shuttle, stowing away aboard a visiting free trader, obtaining security forces uniforms and sneaking out on an [[Ase|Asei]] troop transport, and many other daring approaches just might work.

## The New Order

If the [[Ase|Asei]] security forces figure out that the Travellers are up to something, they attempt to recruit them to their side. The [[Justice For All Initiative]] requires a successful vote in the Moot or all is lost. The [[Ase|Asei]] Concordat has not considered the [[Countess Tranard|Countess of Bendo]] and her proxy votes as a threat. They simply assume she will continue to abstain from voting as she has done for some time. However, if the Travellers are under surveillance, they are called in for questioning by [[Commandant Perry]] himself. He sends [[Sargeant Tolian Muray|Sargeant Muray]] to fetch and bring them to the Fusing Core for a private meeting. After introductions and brief pleasantries, the commandant says the following:

> _The Count of [[Ase]] and the [[Ase|Asei]] Concordat are instituting a new interstellar order. The security of [[Capital]] and indeed all of the [[Core Subsector|Core]] is at stake. Citizens would be wise to support these changes; those who oppose them will be defeated. You can either get behind them or be flattened by them. You need to pick a side. I assure you that the Count of [[Ase]] can be a generous man. If you support us, you will be aptly rewarded for your loyalty, service to the count and, by extension, the Emperor himself._

The commandant asks the Travellers for their commitment and wants to know what they would like in return. He can offer them a great deal of money if they commit to the [[Ase|Asei]] cause. He offers them MCr1 to begin with but can be negotiated up to MCr2. Should they commit to the [[Ase|Asei]] cause, he provides them with [[Encrypted Meson Transceiver|TL14 encrypted communications devices]], which will allow his agents to communicate with them in secret from a distance of up to 50,000km. He also asks where they are going next and what their plans are. If the Travellers answer truthfully that they intend to travel to Tertha, possibly even telling him what their mission is there, he informs them that he will send a team of agents to assist them.

If the Travellers decline the commandant's offer, he does not stand in their way. They should have acquired an exemption by now and are free to go. However, his agents attempt to apply microdrone bugs to each of the Travellers, which are used to track their movements. This is in addition to the microbiome bugs they may have imbibed if they drank the '[[#^housespecial|house special]]' at the Fusing Core. Detecting the bugs requires countersurveillance equipment of TL14 or higher.

The [[Ase|Asei]] are not the only party interested in the Travellers' next move. While [[Syn To Rei]] and the [[Yirsh Poy Syndicate]] are not tracking them with high-tech devices, they have made their position clear; the Travellers owe them a debt which they mean to collect.

# The Reluctant Countess

See

- [[Tertha]] and [[Tertha#Renegade Roost]]

Once they find the Roost, docking with it is not a problem if they have [[#Uivi]] with them. The countess' seneschal knows where all the concealed airlocks are. If they do not have [[#Uivi]] with them for some reason, a spacewalk and some detailed searches of the surface will be required in order to find an entrance.

> [!info]+ FINDING THE ROOST
> If finding [[Calago]] on [[Affinity]] was not difficult enough, the Travellers must now face the challenge of finding a 90-meter-wide space rock in a system filled with space rocks. The countess has arranged her life in such a way that when she wants privacy, she has it – sometimes for months on end without contact. At the time of their arrival, the countess has been incommunicado for about a month. No one knows her whereabouts.
>
> Despite the elusiveness of the countess, there are ways to find her. Allow the Travellers to come up with a solution to the problem. They should have Seneschal [[#Uivi]] with them but he has little in the way of technical acumen, having spent his life managing the affairs of spoiled nobles instead of learning how to use high- tech electronics. Some possible ways to find her include:
>
> - Tracking [[Tertha#Renegade Roost|Renegade Roost]] from its last known location: Sherman last altered the Roost's orbit 60 days   ago. By studying Sherman's log, the Travellers can attempt to identify a pattern in the last several   changes to its orbit and then narrow down the possibilities. Have the Travellers make a Difficult (10+)   Science (astronomy) check (1D days, EDU); if successful, apply the Effect to a Very Difficult (12+)   Astrogation check (1Dx4 hours, EDU) to identify 1D likely candidates among the myriad asteroids in   the system.
> - Find a repeater: The countess last made an encrypted call to [[Tertha]] one month ago, using a repeater   to preserve her privacy. While the location of the Roost was obscured, the location of the repeater   is known. They can travel to the repeater, which is emplaced on an asteroid in the L4 point of the   system's primary star and its nearest gas giant, a 'hot Jupiter' called Furnace. The transmission to   the repeater was encrypted but a successful Difficult (10+) Electronics (comms) check (1D hours,   EDU) enables them to determine the telemetry of the Roost. A failed check scrambles the data in the   repeater computer, preventing further scrutiny.
> - Apply the sensor array at [[Tertha]] Highport to observe minute changes in asteroid albedo: When the Roost deploys its solar panels – which it does about once per week – its reflects significantly   more light, making it stand out among the field. Have the Travellers make a Difficult (10+) Science   (astronomy) or Electronics (sensors) check (1D days, EDU) to identify the proverbial needle in   the haystack. They may employ their ship's sensors for this task as well but with significantly less   accuracy; change the task to Formidable (14+).
> - Ask the belter community: Belters are constantly cataloguing and investigating the system's rocks   and some among them are bound to have spotted the Roost. Make a Difficult (10+) Streetwise check   (1D days, SOC) to locate a belter who knows where it is and then persuade them to give up the  coordinates, possibly for the price of a few thousand Credits.

Upon entering the Roost, the Travellers make their way through the utilities section and then find themselves on the floor of the biosphere. The asteroid is approximately 65 meters in diameter on its short axis and 90 meters on the long axis. The interior loop is about 180 meters. Looking upward, they can see the looping biosphere above them. Classical music blares out from a sound system hidden among the plant life. The countess floats in zero-G in the central airspace of the immense room.

She is shocked and more than a little angry – at least at first – to see them trespassing upon her refuge. Two [[Tertha#Shadow Security Robot|camouflaged security robots]] reveal themselves and approach the Travellers menacingly. If the Travellers pose no threat, she dismisses the robots, shuts the music down and uses her lightweight grav assist – which is completely invisible within her clothing – to float down to the Travellers like a sylph in a medieval fairy tale.

> [!warning]
> If [[Ase|Asei]] security forces are aware that the Travellers were going to Tertha, they have likely figured out the purpose of the visit. The [[Ase|Asei]] send agents to ensure that their interests are served. After the Travellers work out where [[Tertha#Renegade Roost|Renegade Roost]] is and make plans to go there, the agents' next move depends on whether the Travellers have committed to help the [[Ase|Asei]] or not. If they have, the agents contact the Travellers via the meson communication devices given to them by the commandant. The agents request that the Travellers get the countess' commitment to stay out of the Moot election. If she intends to go to the Moot to vote, they order the Travellers to 'deal with her' by whatever means are necessary. If they do not follow these orders and the countess is allowed to leave the Roost, the agents attempt to kidnap or assassinate the countess themselves before she leaves Tertha.
>
> If the Travellers did not ally themselves with the [[Ase|Asei]] but the commandant has managed to bug them, then the agents are tracking their movements and will make their move against the Travellers and the countess the moment they leave the Roost.

### [[Ase|Asei]] Agents

STR 7 DEX 9 END 9 INT 7 EDU 7 SOC 7
Gun Combat (slug) 1, Recon 0, Stealth 1, Streetwise 1, Tactics (military) 1, Vacc Suit 1
Weapons: Accelerator Rifle (3D, Zero-G), Snub Pistol (3D-3, Zero-G)

A team of [[Ase|Asei]] agents have been dispatched to [[Tertha]] to aid the Travellers if they have accepted the commandant's offer or to work against them if they have not. If they are not working in concert with the Travellers, the agents attempt to either invade [[Tertha#Renegade Roost|Renegade Roost]] or intercept their pinnace en route to Tertha. The agents have access to an armed pinnace for the operation.

## Making Their Case

After getting past the initial awkwardness from having invaded her home, the Travellers have an opportunity to make their case to the countess, if indeed that is what they have come to do. If [[#Uivi]] is with them, he expects them to solicit the countess' aid at the Moot, using her voting bloc to defeat the [[Justice For All Initiative]] . However, the Travellers have by now been solicited by three parties, each of whom want the Travellers to represent their interests.

In any event, the Travellers have the opportunity to speak to Countess Tranard, urged on by her seneschal, with whom she seems to have a love-hate relationship. She explains why she has collected proxies from other nobles, only to rarely use them. The countess is from an old and powerful family on Bendo whose heritage goes back to the pre-Imperial era. They were wealthy industrialists in the era of the Interstellar Confederacy and heavily invested in the Achenaar-Antilles Line. Their minority holding in the company is worth billions of Credits in modern times. The Confederacy was defeated and pacified over 1,100 years ago but its culture never truly expunged by the Imperium.

The spinward portion of the Old Confederacy in Bunkeria has been fully integrated. By allowing the Bunkerians more freedom and semi-autonomous control of their subsector navy, the Imperium has made loyal subjects of them. The Cemplas subsector worlds are a different story. Ironically, Cemplas is closer to Capital, yet many of its worlds have resisted complete integration for over a millennium. Bendo, the countess' homeworld, is a peaceful world with no major insurgent movements but the countess represents a larger bloc of worlds in the region, many of whom chafe under Imperial control. The proximity of the region to [[Capital]] means that any hopes for a cultural zone or additional liberties are out of the question. In her travels amongst the worlds of Cemplas, the countess has become very popular for celebrating the virtues of Old Confederacy culture and supporting the dream of independence, however unlikely that is of reaching fruition. In the process, the countess has acquired proxies from many of Cemplas' nobles, whom she represents by not voting in most Moot elections. Emperor Strephon is not pleased by her actions and vaguely hints that he might revoke her noble patent, although doing so would likely cause more problems than it solves. Removing her in favor of a pro-Imperial count or countess to oversee the region might cause an outright revolt on some of Cemplas' worlds.

If she could be convinced to break her protest by going to [[Capital]] to vote against [[Justice For All Initiative]], she could break Ase's ambitions to control the [[Sylean Main]]. Convincing the countess to go against the grain of her beliefs will not be easy. The values she represents go back generations. The process of lobbying her to change her mind could be reduced to a series of checks using Diplomat, Persuade and Carouse skills but ideally the Travellers efforts will be resolved with good roleplaying. If they can make a convincing argument and the Referee, in the role of the countess, is convinced that she should break tradition in service to the common good, then she consents to accompany them.

Some possible points that the Travellers might make:

- Inaction will ultimately cause strife for everyone, the Old Confederacy worlds included.
- The initiative disproportionately affects the Old Confederacy region with fully half of the affected subsidiary worlds located in the Bunkeria and Cemplas subsectors.
- If anyone thinks that Ase's ambitions stop after imposing [[Justice For All Initiative]], they need to think again. [[Tertha]] and similar low-population systems are likely to be targeted next.
- The countess' protest has already had the desired effect. The Emperor has taken notice and left her county intact in spite of the borderline insurrection it represents. Acting on behalf of the people does not compromise her position.

There are many points to be made in favor of taking action. However, the countess is a strong-minded and argumentative woman. For every point that the Travellers make, she makes what she believes to be an equally valid counterargument. The Travellers will have to stick to their guns and show some conviction if they want to sway her to their side. Leave it to the Travellers to make a compelling argument that convinces the countess. For his part, [[#Uivi]] mostly stands by to watch the fireworks. Should the Travellers transgress the boundaries of respect that should be afforded to his patron, he intervenes to set things right – furthermore, there are two deadly security robots present should the Travellers get out of hand – but ultimately [[#Uivi]] wants to see the countess act against the initiative. While the seneschal is a native of Bendo, he is an Affinitian at heart and Eneri's Cantina is one of his favorite places on the [[Sylean Main]]. He does not want to see either diminish under the jackbooted heel of authoritarianism.

## Next Moves

If [[Countess Tranard]] is moved to act, she quickly hatches a plan and enlists the Travellers to support a bold and aggressive move. The countess insists that they first travel to [[Affinity]], where she intends to stage a protest march through Restoration Plaza to announce her intention to oppose [[Justice For All Initiative]] at none other than Eneri's Cantina. _'Call it our declaration of independence'_ she says. The countess intends to make the affair public so that [[Ase]] cannot move against her without recrimination. The more public their actions, the less likely any skulduggery will happen before the vote takes place on [[Capital]].

The countess calls her staff to bring her pinnace to [[Tertha#Renegade Roost|Renegade Roost]] to take her to the starport where her yacht, _Beauregard's Vendetta_ , is berthed. Regardless of whether the Travellers have come to her asteroid aboard a jump-capable ship, she insists upon taking her own conveyance to [[Affinity]]. Appearances are important and she cannot be seen skulking about on some far trader when she arrives at [[Affinity#Affinity Highport|Affinity Highport]]. Her arrival must be public and she must be aboard her own ship.

Alternatively, if the Travellers have aligned themselves with the [[Ase|Asei]] and came to dissuade the countess from acting (possibly even eliminating her), then their job is done on [[Tertha]] and they may return to [[Affinity]]. If they have taken this route, the events in the following chapter do not occur. The Travellers are rewarded by the commandant for their loyal service and they may either stay at [[Affinity]] or proceed to [[Capital]] where the [[Justice For All Initiative]] is expected to pass.

> [!info]- OTHER CHOICES
> The Travellers might have chosen a different path: working with Ase, the [[Yirsh Poy Syndicate]], some combination of the two or perhaps simply being neutral when it comes to [[Justice For All Initiative]]. If the Travellers have opted to work against [[Affinity]], Eneri's Cantina and [[Zashe]] herself, [[#Uivi]] is shocked. He becomes indignant, attempts to end the discussion and escort the Travellers off [[Tertha#Renegade Roost|Renegade Roost]].

# Independence Day

![[CA2-50_1476396033.jpg]]
Upon their return to [[Affinity#Affinity Highport|Affinity Highport]], the Travellers find the place much as they left it: interdicted and secured under martial law. If the [[Ase|Asei]] agents were present on Tertha, they beat the Travellers back to [[Affinity]]. If not, the countess' visit to [[Affinity]] comes as a surprise. In either case, [[Countess Tranard]] is denied access to [[Affinity#Affinity Highport|Affinity Highport]] 'for her own safety' according to the [[Ase|Asei]] security forces. An [[Ase|Asei]] patrol corvette is dispatched to the _Beauregard's Vendetta_ , allegedly to defend it but its presence seems more menacing than protective. Getting the countess into the starport is going to require additional manoeuvring.

The Travellers might encourage the countess to impose her authority by exercising her right to access the starport, regardless of the conditions there. Starports are extraterritorial possessions of the Imperium and do not belong to individual worlds. While the [[Ase|Asei]] have interdicted [[Affinity#Affinity Highport|Affinity Highport]] on the premise that they are protecting their subsidiary world, they are on shaky ground when it comes to denying access to a member of the Imperial bureaucracy. The Travellers may make an Average (8+) Advocate or Diplomat check (SOC) to cite the appropriate Imperial laws and protocols, thereby forcing the [[Ase|Asei]] security forces to grant a berth to _Beauregard's Vendetta_. If the Travellers have come back to [[Affinity]] aboard a separate ship, they are not granted access and must be aboard the yacht if they hope to re-enter the highport.

Once docked, the countess, her retinue, the security robots and the Travellers can make their next move. While Seneschal [[#Uivi]] is very familiar with [[Affinity#Affinity Highport|Affinity Highport]], the countess has only been there a few times. The countess asks the Travellers to organise the march to Restoration Park. While the Travellers can certainly count on [[Zashe]], [[Calago]] and the other regulars at Eneri's Cantina to participate, they can rally hundreds, possibly thousands of additional participants with some effort. This can be played out with roleplaying, abstracted by completing a task chain or some combination of the two.

Should the Travellers opt to play the recruitment scenario out, they can find willing participants in many sectors of [[Affinity#Affinity Highport|Affinity Highport]] but the strongest supporters may be found in the residential and commercial districts. The people have been cowed into submission by the [[Ase|Asei]] security forces and many fear for their lives but they are also afraid about what the future holds if the [[Ase|Asei]] are allowed to impose their will on [[Affinity]]. Convincing individuals or groups to participate in the march requires a successful Difficult (10+) Persuade check (INT or SOC) for each individual or group the Travellers attempt to recruit. The Effect of each check indicates the number of recruits the Travellers have acquired for the march. Apply DM+2 if the Travellers invoke the name of Countess Tranard, the sponsor of the march. Knowing that an Imperial noble is on their side carries a lot of weight. It takes more of an effort but the Travellers can gain additional positive DMs by stirring the people with a compelling narrative. The Referee may reward them with an additional DM+2 if they tell a good story to their would-be recruits. Some of the things they might mention include:

- [[Affinity]] has always been a free world and up until recently was Law Level 1, with all the liberties that entails.
- [[Ase]] is using [[Affinity]] as a pawn in a political game for their own benefit.
- [[Affinity]] is not alone in this struggle. The [[Justice For All Initiative]] affects nine other worlds, all of which are being subjugated.

The Referee may determine whether their performance warrants the additional DM+2 or resolve it with a check by having the Travellers make a Difficult (10+) Art (performer) or Carouse check (SOC).

The goal of this part of the adventure is to stir the Travellers to play out their convictions. If they want to preserve [[Affinity]]'s independence, they are going to have to work for it. If they succeed by their actions and with the support of the countess, they become heroes on [[Affinity]] and establish a unique bond with its people and the denizens of Eneri's Cantina.

The Travellers' efforts do not go unnoticed by the [[Ase|Asei]] security forces. Furthermore, not everyone whom the Travellers attempt to recruit is thrilled about returning to the way things were. There will be some residents of the highport who would prefer more law and order, even the rather authoritarian brand offered by Ase. Some among these people will report the Travellers' actions to members of the security forces, resulting in a confrontation or two. Should the Travellers confront a patrol directly, they risk being thrown in jail. If this occurs, [[Countess Tranard]] can have them liberated within 24 hours, although she urges them to avoid additional confrontations. While the starport is technically Imperial territory, its civilian, commercial and industrial districts are under the purview of Ase. She might not be able to get them out of jail a second time. If they stay out of trouble, the Travellers should be able to peacefully assemble at Restoration Plaza thanks to the presence and support of their noble sponsor.

Countess Tranard defers to the Travellers when it comes to arranging the march. They may start it on deck 1 and proceed upward through the decks to Restoration Plaza, start at a landmark that has significance to the Travellers and proceed from there, or simply assemble in the plaza and deliver their speeches. As for the speeches themselves, this is yet another opportunity to expand the story as much as desired. For her part, the countess spends a full hour on the stage, perhaps overstaying her welcome, initially describing the plight of the Old Confederacy but eventually delving into the current crisis. The gist of her speech is that should the subsidiary worlds of the [[Sylean Main]] have their agency stripped, there is little to keep the authoritarian worlds of [[Core Subsector|Core]] from proceeding to their next target and then the next target after that. She concludes by paraphrasing a poem by the ancient Terran orator, Martin Niemöller:

> _First they came for the Infrared Party and I did not_
> _speak out. Because I was not an Infrared._
> _Then they came for the Red Party and I did not_
> _speak out. Because I was not a Red._
> _Then they came for the Orange Party and I did not_
> _speak out. Because I was not an Orange._
> _Then they came for me —_
> _and there was no one left to speak for me._

If they choose to participate, the Travellers are also given time at the podium. [[Countess Tranard]] simply urges them to speak from the heart. 'Tell them how it is and how it will be if we fight for our rights.'

During the demonstration at Restoration Plaza, the [[Ase|Asei]] security forces station themselves in strategic positions. They are armed and their presence is intimidating to many in the crowd. Additional support from the Travellers might be required to keep some of their fellow demonstrators from fleeing the site before the event is over. In the end, the [[Ase|Asei]] do nothing. With the holocameras running, the presence of journalists, and hundreds, if not thousands of people gathering peacefully, there is little that they can do. With their signature cause about to be voted on in the Moot, the last thing they need is negative publicity.

# All Roads Lead to Capital

After the demonstration ends, the countess urges the Travellers to gather their things and prepare for departure. They must now go to [[Capital]] for the vote. They may take the countess' yacht but there is the danger that the Count of [[Ase]] will perform some sort of procedural shenanigans and force an early decision on the initiative before the countess can be there to have her votes counted. Should the Travellers desire faster transport to Capital, allow them to make an Average (8+) Streetwise check (1D minutes, SOC) to find an alternative. A successful check reveals that the subsidized liner, _Mustered Out_ , is in port for one moreday before it jumps to [[Capital]]. The liner is part of the  Achenaar-Antilles fleet and the countess can secure passage for all of them.

A week later, they arrive at [[Capital]]. Refer to [[The Third Imperium]] for a detailed description of Capital, the city of [[Cleon]], the [[Grand Imperial Palace of Arbellatra]], the [[Moot Tower]] and the many other attractions and sights to see on the Imperial throne world. When they arrive, the Travellers have a few days to see the sights before they bear to witness the final vote in the Moot Tower.

The Count of [[Ase]] shows that he has a few tricks up his sleeve. A few of the nobles from Cemplas, whose proxies [[Countess Tranard]] holds, petition to buy them back from her in order to vote _for_ the initiative. [[Ase|Asei]] intelligence services have unearthed incriminating information about these nobles and the count has extorted them to vote for the initiative, threatening to make their transgressions public if they do not comply. While these defections to the other side might give the Travellers cause for concern, the countess soothes their worries. She is confident that even with the defections, they still have the votes to defeat the initiative. Nevertheless, the Travellers might put their Investigate and Streetwise skills to work to ascertain the validity of the lurid or spurious claims against the nobles.

There are more rallies and speeches from both sides, most of which are held in the Imperial Park. The vote itself is held the day after the rallies in a private session. Attendance for the vote is higher than normal, making the outcome a bit uncertain but in the end [[Justice For All Initiative]] is defeated. The countess and other members of the Moot demand the immediate recall of all security forces from the subsidiary worlds. The authoritarians are beaten... for now. The forces of tyranny have a way of resurfacing over time but, for the time being, the Travellers, the people of [[Affinity]] and the other subsidiary worlds of the [[Sylean Main]] are victorious. The countess thanks them for 'waking her up' and urging her to do her duty. She still hopes to obtain more freedoms for her people but now hopes to do so by leveraging the powers at her disposal rather than hiding in her refuge.

The Travellers are free to do what they will and go where they like but Seneschal [[#Uivi]] urges them to return to [[Affinity]] to celebrate their victory. Drinks are on him.

> [!info]+ THE ROAD NOT TAKEN
> The alternative approach features the Travellers in support of Ase. If they accepted the commandant's offer or are working with the [[Yirsh Poy Syndicate]], they have betrayed [[Affinity#Affinity Highport|Affinity Highport]] and Eneri's Cantina. This sets up a vastly different future narrative for [[Affinity]], and the other subsidiary worlds of the [[Sylean Main]], but also one that is rife with opportunities.
>
> In service to Ase, or aligned with the [[Sylean Syndicate]]s, the Travellers embark upon a much darker future, one in which individual liberties, free trade and uninhibited travel are curtailed. The Travellers have the opportunity to gain monetary wealth from their arrangements with either of these parties but they might ultimately come to regret their decision. A story of their eventual betrayal against the forces of tyranny could make for an exciting series of adventures, or even an entire campaign, but that is beyond the scope of this adventure.

# Closing Time

The reception that the Travellers experience upon their return to [[Affinity#Affinity Highport|Affinity Highport]] depends upon their actions. If they fought against the tyranny of [[Ase]] and also resisted the temptation to work with the [[Yirsh Poy Syndicate]], then they return as heroes of the people. They are heartily welcomed to Eneri's Cantina where [[Zashe]] has their drinks waiting for them. A full week of celebrations takes place. All of the bar's regulars are eager to give the Travellers a pat on the back and potential patrons line up to hire them for their next gig. In time, the celebrations die down and things return to normal but the Travellers will always be remembered as the heroes who risked their lives for the people of [[Affinity]].

Every path taken has consequences, however, and by supporting one side, they have made enemies with others. [[Ase]]'s government, the Resource Concordat, consider the Travellers to be enemies of the state. They may want to avoid visiting that world lest they end up in jail on trumped up charges. Likewise, the [[Yirsh Poy Syndicate]] still expects the Travellers to pay their debt. The [[Sylean Syndicate]]s are powerful and have a long reach. They may want to settle the bill at some point. Such is the life of a Traveller; being a hero to some usually means being an enemy of others. As long as the Travellers keep moving and make contacts, allies and friends they can depend on, they should be able to get out of whatever scrapes they find themselves in. Whenever they return to Eneri's, they can always count on a reunion with old friends, a game or two of Element, the dulcet tones of a live musical performance and a good stiff drink on the house.
