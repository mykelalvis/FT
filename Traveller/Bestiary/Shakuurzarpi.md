[[#Shakuurzarpi]] are sexually dimorphic oviparous amphibians native to [[Akussanja]]. They are equally comfortable in the sea and on land but typically rest and hibernate in coastal dens. Solitary animals, they meet only for mating and generally avoid contact other than that. [[#Shakuurzarpi]] are brood parasites who lay their eggs in other animals’ nests and dens, and force them to care for the eggs from incubation to hatching. They do this with a specialized talent that enables them to psionically ‘convince’ animals to do the job. [[#Shakuurzarpi]] put this to other uses as well, such as forcing prey to succumb to their attacks or put two species into conflict with each other. Attempts to use it on humans and other animals of higher intelligence produces a mildly unsettling psionic effect but little else.
