> Syleans are a human Minor Race, created by the Ancients who took a sample of the hominid predecessors of _homo sapiens_ from Terra and seeded them on Sylea. The differences between Sylean humans and other subspecies are subtle and it is unclear whether the Ancients subjected them to any form of genetic engineering. Syleans are physically similar to Solomani humans with some minor differences. They are slightly taller with an average height of almost two meters. Their skin is very light, nearly white in some cases, while their hair colour is almost universally dark brown to black, creating a stunning contrast. Sylean eye colour tends to the extremes from an almost crystalline grey or blue to a deep dark brown, appearing almost black.
>
> The primary differences between Syleans and other human subspecies are not physical but cultural. Syleans are a focused and driven race, guided by a long history of oppression at the hands of Vilani and Solomani invaders. While most are now of mixed heritage, having bred with Vilani and Solomani humans, there are still billions of genetically pure Syleans due to the fact that many were isolated in remote reservations on their homeworld deep into the Long Night and maintained their purity even after leaving Sylea for other star systems.
>
> The Syleans are a spiritual and philosophical people. The introduction of interstellar travel and high technology has not disconnected them from religious practices, meditation, spiritual contemplation or any number of other pursuits that have disappeared from the lives of many of their human brethren.

> ## CHARACTERISTICS
>
> Sylean Travellers have the following modifiers applied to their characteristics: STR-1 and EDU+1.
>
> ## TRAITS
>
> Cooperation** : Syleans are exceptionally cooperative with others of their species. When on a Sylean World (one with a Sylean population of 50 percent or more), Sylean Travellers receive DM+2 on Admin, Diplomat and Streetwise checks. This reflects the Syleans’ innate ability to close ranks and cooperate with one another to achieve a desired goal.
>
> ## CAREERS
>
> Almost all of the careers listed in the _Traveller Core Rulebook_ are suitable for Sylean Travellers but the Drifter and Rogue careers require additional explanation.
>
> For the Drifter career, Sylean barbarians and wanderers should be exceedingly rare. The Sylean Worlds are old and well-developed, and there are few low-tech worlds to be found. However, a Sylean might purposely go to a primitive world, perhaps on a journey of spiritual discovery. Most Syleans are very directed and would rarely slip into the wanderer career, although there could be exceptions.
>
> As for the Rogue career, most Syleans gravitate towards honorable professions that provide them with financial and spiritual prosperity, avoiding those that directly involve them in crime for crime’s sake. That said, they are no more or less ethical than humans of any other kind and might indulge in underworld-oriented activities if there are extenuating circumstances. A thief might be in the employ of a corporation, engaged in skulduggery to acquire goods and intelligence by underhanded means. An enforcer might be in the employ of a Sylean cartel or syndicate, which are remarkably similar to the organised crime organizations of other species. Syleans are unlikely to operate as independent pirates but may very well serve as corporate privateers or corsairs who raid enemy shipping with a letter of marque.
>
> In addition to the above career choices, many Syleans are religious and subscribe to one of the traditional Sylean faiths. Sylean Travellers in the priesthood may use the Believer career from the Traveller Companion.
>
> ## WEALTH AND PROSPERITY
>
> Syleans are driven by a desire for prosperity and wealth and receive DM+1 on all Cash Benefit rolls when mustering out of their careers.
