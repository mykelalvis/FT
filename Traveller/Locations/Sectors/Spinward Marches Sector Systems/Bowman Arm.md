The Bowman Arm, sometimes misquoted as _Bowman's Arm,_ is an astrographic grouping of twelve worlds: 
- [[567-908]] 
- [[Asteltine]] 
-  [[Bowman]]
- [[Caliburn]]  
- [[Datrillian]]  
- [[Enos]]  
- [[Faldor]]  
- [[Flammarion]] 
- [[Flexos]]  
- [[Nirton]]  
- [[Squallia]]  
- [[Walston]]

It is an astrographic feature consisting of a number of linked clusters and traces forming part of the [[Spinward Main]].  It is located outside the borders of the [[Imperium]] on the [[Spinward Main]] in [[District 268]] and the [[Sword Worlds Subsector]] of the [[Spinward Marches]].

## Description
The Arm provides the only Jump-1 link between the handful of Imperial worlds in [Five Sisters Subsector] and the rest of Imperial territory. The Arm diverges from the Main at [[Caliburn]]  in the direction of [[Foreven Sector]] and meanders Spinward until [[Flammarion]] and the beginning of the chain known as [[Sisters' Reach]].
## History and Background
The Arm is an underdeveloped backwater and sees much less traffic than the more central parts of the Main; consequently, a great deal is not commonly know about the systems. Given that these frontier worlds are not members of the [[Imperium]], it is difficult at best and more often hazardous for Imperial traders to operate in the Arm.

The coreward arm of the [[Spinward Main]] in [[District 268]] is called the [[Bowman Arm]]. The region lies outside the [[Imperium]] but close enough that Imperial influence is fairly strong. Of the subsector's 32 star systems, 10 are Imperial client states, indicating Imperial colonies or some other type of sponsorship.

Ships bound for the [[Five Sisters subsector]] navigate along the [[Bowman Arm]], although jump-2 ships normally make the transit by hopping from [[Datrillian]] to Walston, then [[Bowman]] to [[Asteltine]], rather than going through every backwater system on the way. The [[Caladbolg]]-[[Enos]]-[[Flammarion]] run is much quicker but politics can prevent easy passage at Enos, which is owned by the [[Sword Worlds Confederation]]. The details presented here are thus simply that: an overview of the world and its place in the [[Bowman Arm]]'s complex economic and political development.
