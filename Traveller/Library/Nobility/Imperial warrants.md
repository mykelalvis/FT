Imperial warrants are instructions printed on physical or encrypted electronic [[Imperial Stationery]] from the Emperor, an archduke or a duke and given to trusted agents of the Imperium. These instructions endow the recipient with the will of the Emperor or high nobility and supercede all other powers. Warrants typically assign a mission of great importance and are often issued in times of crisis when going through official channels is not considered to be a viable option. Emperor Strephon has been known to use Imperial Warrants on occasion, often invoking the assistance clause of [[Imperial Edict 97]] in the process.
