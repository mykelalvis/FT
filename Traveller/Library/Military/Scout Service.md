## IMPERIAL INTERSTELLAR SCOUT SERVICE

The [[Scout Service]] is a fabled institution whose origins predate the Third Imperium. Scouts in the Sylean Federation were mostly freelance explorers who sold their data to the highest bidder until their services were organised under the aegis of the Sylean Federation Scout Service. The Scout Service was restructured and renamed the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service in the year 0.

The modern Scout Service has three branches: Communications, Survey and Exploration. The primary responsibility of the Communications branch is the operation and maintenance of the Imperial X-Boat Network, which provides communication services for the entire Imperium. X-boats are small starships with jump-4 capability that jump from system-to-system, transmitting mail and other data between Imperial worlds. With no maneuver drives of their own, x-boats are serviced by x-boat tenders, which are stationed in every system to which x-boats travel. A reserve of Type-S scout/couriers are also present to transfer information to worlds that are off the main x-boat routes.

The Survey branch is responsible for scientific data collection and stellar cartography (also called astrocartography). Survey scouts are the unsung heroes of the service, recording the stellar and planetology data of each system, working their way from the primary star to the Oort cloud and measuring for subtle changes on subsequent visits. Survey goes beyond Imperial borders to record data from foreign or unincorporated star systems.

### Survey Branch Mission Types

| Survey Class | Description                                                                                                               | Duration   |
| :----------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
|    Class I   | Conducted from a distance of 1–2 parsecs, determines the basic stellar and planetary data of a star system.               | 1 day      |
|   Class II   | In-system survey of primary and subsequent stars and all planetary bodies of notable size.                                | 1 week     |
|   Class III  | Detailed examination of notable planetary bodies. Landing parties launched when necessary.                                | 10 weeks   |
|   Class IV   | Detailed survey of system mainworld and other habitable zone bodies. Probes and landing parties launched to confirm data. | 30 weeks   |
|    Class V   | Detailed probes and surveys of all planetary bodies in a star system, including landing parties to confirm data.          | 5–10 years |

Exploration is often seen as the most glamourous branch of the Scout Service but it is also the most dangerous. More scouts serving in Exploration are lost than from any other branch. Exploration scouts are sent into charted but unexplored systems, their mission to perform cursory surveys and close examinations of planetary bodies if irregularities or anomalies are found. They may also be called upon to perform contact and liaison missions if sophonts are encountered. Newly discovered sophonts are often left alone if the Scout Service determines that a species should be allowed to develop at its own pace and without Imperial interference. Worlds with such populations are sometimes interdicted. Such missions may last centuries or even millennia if necessary.

The one thing all three branches have in common is the Type-S scout, the modern version of which is the _Suleiman_ -class. The Communications branch uses them to transport information to worlds that are off the x-boat routes, keeping them in the loop and ensuring that every Imperial world has access to current information. The Survey and Exploration branches use them as utility starships, performing any number of necessary tasks. Type-S scouts are sometimes named by their crews but officially they only have call signs: a single letter (C for Communications, S for Survey or E for Exploration), six numerical digits followed by a hyphen and a random letter. Survey scouts also use the Donosev -class survey scout ship, a 400-ton ship with more advanced sensors, which enables them to collect the detailed data required.

The Scout Service is overseen by Administration and Operations offices that report to each branch. Administration is responsible for the upkeep of the service, making sure that it has the starships, small craft, vehicles, gear and other resources that it needs to do its many jobs. Administration also recruits new members to the service, often from far-flung worlds of the Imperium. The IISS, more than any other military service, is known for its diversity and inclusion policies. The service actively recruits alien sophonts from all Imperial worlds – and sometimes those beyond its borders – and is known for providing or even devising special equipment to accommodate those from exotic environments. Subordinate to Administration are the Technical Services and Detached Duty offices. Technical Services are called upon to solve complex technical problems or fix damaged scout ships and other equipment. Scouts from each branch are expected to be technically competent and repair their own gear if possible, so Technical Services are only called upon for the most difficult jobs. The Detached Duty office maintains and assigns the service's immense fleet of retired starships. They also keep track of the ex-scouts to which these ships have been assigned. The phrase 'Once a scout, always a scout' is the credo of Detached Duty who track down and assign missions to scouts who have been blessed with the possession of a hardy scout/courier for their own use.

The Operations division of each branch – called 'Ops' by members of the service – evaluates and assigns all scout missions. Jobs in Operations are often thought to be mundane; they are, in fact, anything but. Ops assignments are often on frontier worlds, backwaters and other underserved places where the IISS has deployed a base. Ops personnel are always linked with one of the three primary branches and sometimes manage to put themselves in danger when evaluating whether a mission is required. Ops also includes the vaunted Security division, which protects valuable service assets and engages in espionage activities.

While the scouts are often viewed as only a scientific service or perhaps 'paramilitary' at best, they do put themselves in harm's way and also provide some distinctly military services. The Scout Service Imperial Protection Detail has served the Emperor for centuries, operating as a lightly armed secret service whose sole job it is to prevent an assassination from taking place, sacrificing their lives if necessary.

### SCOUT BASES AND WAY STATIONS

The IISS maintains a system of bases and way stations. Scout bases include administrative centres and repair and maintenance facilities for scout vessels. Scout bases may be located on worlds with a Class D or better starport but are most common on worlds with lower starport levels. Many of these worlds are found in low-tech, out-of-the-way star systems. Scout bases may be located in orbital or planetary facilities since the majority of scout ships are in the sub-1,000-ton range.

Way stations provide support, repair and maintenance for the vast Imperial X-Boat Network and training and personnel services for the entire IISS. Way stations are  found only on worlds with Class A or B starports. There are typically two to four way stations per sector with as many as nine in the more populous, centrally located sectors of the Imperium.
