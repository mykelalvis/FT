## STANDARDS AND ASSUMPTIONS

Place: This adventure takes place entirely in the [[Phlume]] system (C887624 - 8), with the majority of the adventure taking place onboard the derelict Imperial battlecruiser [[#Lariinaan]].

## Introduction

Date: 083- 1107

Place: [[Phlume]], [[Vilis Subsector]]

## CHARACTERS

This adventure is intended for use with any group of adventurers available; they can be any sort of individuals as long as they are looking for some type of remunerative job. The text of the adventure can be altered to use nearly any type of adventuring group. 

### Desirable Skills
The specific usefulness of any skill, ultimately depends on the players and how they use their characters. Nevertheless, vacc suit skill and weapon skill can be of relatively great importance to all characters. For those characters who do not have any vacc suit skill or desire to use other weapons, assign them vacc-0 and weapon-0. Vacc-0 indicates a certain familiarity with vacc suits sufficient to allow the use of one and to avoid making fatal mistakes when in vacuum. Weapon-0 should be taken by the individual in a specific weapon. Ideally the weapon will be mated to the individual’s strength and dexterity to allow dexterity bonuses, or to avoid dexterity penalties. In addition, weapon-0 avoids the negative DM associated with lack of skill.  Referees using an on-going campaign should ignore the remainder of this section.

### Pre-Generated Characters
A group of pre-generated characters is provided, although the referee may allow other characters instead. Any group of characters will suffice provided they have a wide range of skills and are adequately played by the players. Important skills for this adventure include blade combat, gun combat and streetwise. If pre- generated characters are used, but there are fewer than eight adventurers in the adventurers, the first listed characters should be used first. 

1. **Retired Navy Admiral** 768BCA Age 46 7 terms Cr45, Blade-1, Computer-2, Gun Cbt-2, Navigation-3, Vacc Suit- 1 Blade, High Passage, TAS

2. **Retired Scout** 7988A7 Age 42 6 terms Cr30, Blade-1, Gun Cbt-1, Electronics-2, Pilot-3, Vacc Suit-1, Vehicle- 2 Blade, Gun, Scout Ship

3. **Ex-Merchant 2nd Officer** 7889A8 Age 34 4 terms Cr40, Gun Cbt-1, Electronics-1, Engineering-3, Mechanical-2, Vacc Suit- 1 Blade, Gun

4. **Ex-Marine Lt Colonel** 8A789A Age 30 3 terms Cr50, Cutlass-1, Gun Cbt-2, Medical-3, Revolver-1, Vacc Suit- 1 Blade, TAS

5. **Retired Army** 968786 Age 38 5 terms Cr30, Brawling-1, Gambling-1, Rifle-1, SMG-2, Tactics-1, Vehicle- 2 Gun, High Passage

6. **Ex-Other** 7BAC84 Age 46 7 terms Cr30, Blade-1, Bribery-2, Gambling-1, Gun Cbt-1, Jack-of-Trades-2, Streetwise- 2 Gun, Low Passage

7. **Ex-Navy Commander** 6879B9 Age 30 3 terms Cr20, Admin-2, Blade-1, Gun Cbt-1, Gunnery-2, Ship’s Boat-2, Vacc Suit- 1 Blade, High Passage

8. **Retired Merchant** 779895 Age 50 8 terms Cr30, Blade-1, Gun Cbt-1, Jack-of-Trade-2, Medical-1, Steward-3, Streetwise- 1 Blade, Gun

Characters may be assigned randomly by the referee, or the players may be allowed to select the ones they specifically want by some sort of seniority system.

### EQUIPMENT
Characters should review their equipment, and may purchase made. Each of the pre-generated characters has no items other than those detailed in the listing. At the beginning of the adventure, before the characters are told the details of their predicament, they should be told they are interstellar travellers in search of a job, and allowed to purchase any equipment they feel will be necessary or desirable. Any equipment available may be purchased subject only to the following restrictions:

The equipment must be mentioned and priced in Book 1 or Book 2 of **Traveller** or in the available equipment table, and

The price indicated must be paid.

Note that price levels preclude some equipment (for example, battle dress) due to the restricted finances of the group. Once the adventure begins, the items in the available equipment table are no longer possible to purchase, and only specific items of tech level 8 or less will be on the market to purchase.

The [[#Available Equipment Table]] below presents items which are also available to the adventurers. Individual characters may purchase, carry, and use these which are selected.

Players should be allowed approximately ten minutes  to select the equipment which they would like. The adventurers having access to a starship is essential, whether this is their own or through employment by a trade organization. The Retired Scout in the pre-generated characters has a Scout Ship which fulfills this criteria.

### Available Equipment Table

Motion Scanner: (Cr 125+25 per tech level over 10.; TL 10). Handheld motion scanners provide military and non-military personnel with the ability to detect potential approaching threats. When activated, the motion scanner sends out a pulse that detects moving objects and provides the user with the distance and bearing of these objects in relation to the scanner. At TL-10, the range of detection is 150m, increasing by 50m per tech level above that. At TL-12+ the scanner can also provide information on the speed and size of the moving object. Anyone with Army, Marine, Navy or Scout background is automatically trained in the use of motion scanners. Other careers can receive the training for an additional Cr 250.

## STARTING THE ADVENTURE

The referee should ensure that the players each have their characters, and should inform players of the basic background facts given in Standards and Assumptions.

Next, the referee should run the players through the events in the chapter [[#The Edge Of Nowhere]]. This takes place in the [[Phlume]] star system, and introduces the adventurers to the situation they will be have to deal with.

When all the preliminaries are completed, the main adventure begins with [[#Search For The Lariinaan]].
![[PTri-16.jpg]]


# The Edge Of Nowhere

Enroute to Phlume to deliver your current cargo. Suddenly your starship dropped out of jump space. A quick astro-navigation check revealed you had emerged at the furthest edge of the Phlume star system, with an expected travel time to Phlume of around 10 days at 2-G ( roll 8+; DM +1 Intel 9+, + Educ 9+, +1 Navigation- 1 - failure, the route to Phlume calculated will take 13 days of travel, success, the route calculated can be reduced to 7 days by using gravitational slingshots around other worlds in the system ). To further complicate matters, long-range communications seemed to also be being affected by whatever had caused your ship to exit jump space early and onboard power is fluctuating wildly.

## “ANOTHER FINE MESS ...”

At this point, the adventurers may want to further assess their situation:

- roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Educ 9+, + Engineering-1, +1 ex-Merchant, ex-Navy or ex- Scout - success, the jump drive has insufficient fuel to permit any further jumps,, which would be risky anyway
- roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 8+, +1 Educ 8+, + Engineering-1, +1 Navigation-1, +1 ex-Merchant, ex-Navy or ex-Scout - the jump drive is unlikely to work again unless the reason for the drop-out can be determined, and fixed
- roll 10+; DM +1 Intel 8+, +1 Educ 9+, + Computer-1, +1 Engineering-1, +1 Navigation-1, +1 Pilot-1, +1 ex-Merchant, ex-Navy or ex-Scout - success, the ship’s flight records and sensors confirm the presence of a large electromagnetic, spatial phenomena that potentially could interfere with ships in jump space
- roll 8+; DM +1 Intel 8+, +1 Educ 8+, +1 Computer
- 1, +1 Electronics-1, +1 Engineering-1, + Mechanical- 1 - success, the communications is being disrupted by electromagnetic interference
- roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 8+, +1 Educ 8+, +1 Computer-1, +1 Engineering-1, +1 Navigation- 1 - success, launching a message probe would be possible but it would take approximately 15 days to reach a point where its signal would be detectable on [[Phlume]]
- roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 8+, +1 Educ 8+, +1 Electronics-1, +1 Engineering-1, +1 Mechanical-1 - success, the ship’s power plant has also been affected by the phenomena and could potentially stop working at any time
- roll 8+; DM +1 Intel 8+, +1 Educ 8+, +1 Admin-1, +1 Computer-1, +1 Steward- 1 - success, the remaining supplies onboard will only be able to feed the ship’s complement for 8 days, this might be able to be stretched to 16 days with strict rationing

To summarize, the adventurers are effectively stranded at the edge of [[Phlume]] without hope of contacting anyone able to rescue them in any reasonable time-frame. They have limited power and food remaining, and are unlikely to reach [[Phlume]] before those run out.

![[PTri-21.jpg]]

## “MAYDAY! MAYDAY!”

As the adventurers are sitting, reflecting on their situation, the communications array suddenly comes to life.

“Ma.d..! M...ay! T..s is t.. bat... cr.... _Lar....an_. We h..e s.ff...d ju.. fa..u.e and n..d imm....t. ass..ta..e! A.. sh.p he..i.g t..s mes...e, ple... as..st!”

The signal is degraded and badly broken up. The adventurers may attempt to enhance it and remove some of the static ( roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Educ 8+, +1 Computer-1, +1 Electronics- 1 - success, the signal becomes slightly clearer ).

“Ma.d.y! Mayday! Th.s is t.. battle. crui... _Larii..an_. We h.ve suff...d jum. fai.u.e and ne.d immed..t. assista..e! A.. ship hea.i.g t..s message, ple... as..st!”

Further attempts to enhance the signal can be made ( roll 10+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Educ 8+, +1 Computer- 1, +1 Electronics- 1 - success, the signal becomes clearer and additional information is received ).

“Mayday! Mayday! This is the battle cruiser _Lariinaan_. We have suffered jump failure and need immediate assistance! Any ship hearing this message, please assist!

This is Captain Bleddyn Mathias Wilson-Aadarkhi_._ The date is 217-1100. We have suffered a catastrophic drive failure and need immediate assistance.

We are trapped by an intense electromagnetic anomaly and are losing power rapidly. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Please respond!”

![[PTri-23.jpg]]

## THE NEXT STEPS

Although the distress signal is old, and degraded, it is coming from somewhere nearby. The adventurers may be able to pinpoint the location of the signal through triangulation, if they move the ship to a different position ( roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 8+, +1 Educ 8+, +1 Computer-1, +1 Electronics-1, +1 Navigation-1 - success, the location of the Lariinaan is determined to within a 5000km^2 area ). The adventurers can look up the records on the Lariinaan and its captain, as these are readily available as public record. However, there is also every possibility that the adventurers knew, or served with someone lost on the Lariinaan ( roll 10+; DM +1 per term served in Navy or Scouts, +1 per two terms served in Army, Marines or Merchants, +1 per three terms served in Others ). The person known could be a relative, friend, or ex-romantic partner. Potentially, the adventurers may have known the captain ( roll 10+, DM +1 Intel 10+, +1 Educ 10+, +1 Soc 10+, +1 ex-Navy, +1 ex-Navy and rank Captain or higher.

What can be determined is, the _Lariinaan_ is likely to have fuel reserves that could be used to refuel the adventurers’ starship. It may still have supplies left onboard that the adventurers could make use of. It may even have equipment that they can use to repair their own jump drive and power plant.

As a final incentive, the Baron of Phlume placed a reward of Cr1000000 for information regarding the fate of the _Lariinaan_ , which has not yet been claimed.

# Search For The Lariinaan

## NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK

The priority now facing the adventurers is finding the exact location of the missing ship.

The adventurers hopefully have narrowed their search to a 5000km^2 area, but that is still a vast amount of space to search in the hopes of finding a ship that is less than 1km in length. A veritable needle in a haystack that the adventures must find if they have any chance of survival.

Once the adventurers have moved their vessel to the designated search area, they can attempt to further narrow this through a variety of techniques. Each method takes three hours of time to complete (unless otherwise stated in the method).

- Triangulating the distress signal further could reduce the area needing to be searched ( roll 9+ DM +1 Intel 8+, +1 Educ 8+, +1 Computer-1, +1 Electronics-1, +1 Navigation- 1 - each success requires an hour of time, plus an additional hour to move the ship to a new position. Three successes in a row will narrow the search down to a 100km_**^2 **_area ).
- Locating the electromagnetic phenomena mentioned in the distress signal may also narrow the search area ( roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 8+, +1 Educ 8+, +1 Computer-1, +1 Electronics-1, + Navigation- 1 - success, the location of the phenomena is identified, narrowing the search to a 100km_**^2 **_area ).
- Checking historical records for previous attempts to locate the missing battlecruiser could also prove useful ( roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 8+, +1 Educ 8+, +_** Computer-1, +1 Navigation-1, +1 ex-Naby or ex- Scout - success, allows the elimination of a large area, narrowing the search to a 100km^2 area ).
- Combining the results of the three searches focusses the area greatly ( roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 8+, +1 Educ 8+, +1 Computer-1, +1 Navigation-1, + ex-Navy or ex-Scout - success, the overlap of the three searches results in a area left to be searched of 1km^2 ).

## “THERE SHE BLOWS!”

Hopefully, having managed to reduce the search area to 1km^2 , the adventurers will now be able to find the derelict with ease ( roll 8+; DM +1 Intel 8+, +1 Educ 8+, +1 Computer-1, +1 Electronics-1, +1 Fwd Observer-1, +1 Navigation-1, +1 ex-Navy or ex- Scout, +1 if ship’s sensors have been enhanced at some previous time - success means that the adventurers pinpoint The Lariinaan ). Having located the position of the missing ship, the adventurers can now move their own vessel to rendezvous with it. As they approach the derelict, they may wish to make some sensor scans of the Lariinaan ( roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 8+, +1 Educ 8+, +1 Computer-1, +1 Electronics-1, +1 Engineering-1, +1 Navigation-1, +1 ex-Navy - each success provides one piece of information to the adventurers ). They can learn the following:

- The ship appears to be in an unstable orbit around the strange electromagnetic phenomena. This means that it is moving slowly and erratically, making tracking its location very difficult and may explain why it has never previously been found.
- Power levels on the _Lariinaan_ are minimal, although not non-existent. Given the time frame since the ship was lost, even with he power plant operating at minimum output, it should have run out of fuel and thus no longer be providing power.
- There are no life signs onboard the derelict. However, a second scan for life signs might reveal more information ( roll 10+; DM +1 Intel 9+, + Educ 9+, +1 Computer-1, +1 Electronics-1, + Medical- 1 - success, there are indications of potential life signs operating at a much reduced metabolic rate, possibly survivors in cold sleep ).
- The distress signal is on a repeated loop and, as is standard on Imperial starships, has its own independent power supply which will likely lasty for the next century. It may be possible to cannibalize this to provide the adventurers’ starship with parts for their power plant.

![[PTri-26.jpg|200]]
[[PTri-26.jpg|Anomaly]]

The adventurers may also be interested in learning more about the strange electromagnetic phenomena. Sensor scans of the phenomena, and researching the library data, could help ( roll 10+; +1 Intel 9+, +1 Educ 9+, +1 Computer-1, +1 Electronics-1, +1 ex-Scout - each success provides one piece of information to the adventurers ). The can learn the following:

- The phenomena is outputting radiation across the entire electromagnetic range. None of it is at harmful levels.
- Dating the phenomena proves to be incredibly difficult but the best guess, based on some of the radiation types detected, is over 250000 to 300000 years old.
- There is a large gravimetric field at the heart of the phenomena. This may be what is making _The_ _Lariinaan_ orbit the phenomena.
- The phenomena is releasing gravimetric waves at a wavelength that matches with jump space, and these are likely the cause of the disruption to their jump drive and that of the _Lariinaan_ seven years earlier.
- The phenomena is creating a distortion within the local area, affecting all forms of electromagnetic communication. This distortion appears to have created a bubble in space from which the communication signals cannot escape. This may also explain why the distress signal from the _Lariinaan_ has not been detected up until the adventurers discovered it.
- Some of the particles being released by the phenomena have a strange frequency modulation. A second successful sensor scan focusing on this will indicate that the phenomena appears to be connected to a region of space with properties similar to jump space.
- There are indications that the phenomena is decaying. A second successful sensor scan focusing on this will indicate that the phenomena will likely collapse within the next six to eight hours. The adventurers may realize that if their starship is still in the area when the phenomena collapses, then they are likely to become trapped within the anomaly ( roll 10+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Educ 9+, +1 Computer-1, +1 Navigation-1, +1 Pilot-1, + ex-Navy or ex-Scout ).
- The space within the phenomena does not act in the same manner as normal space. Although the area is a vacuum, the temperature registers as around 20<sup>o</sup>C.

One final piece of information may be revealed regarding the phenomena if the adventurers perform a more in-depth scan of it ( roll 11+; +1 Intel 9+, + Educ B+, +1 Computer-1, +1 Electronics-1, + Medical-3, +1 ex-Scout - success, the sensors detect a very faint “signature” within the phenomena, this signature matches Imperial records of Droyne coyn technology ).

# Boarding The Lariinaan

The adventurers need to maneuver their starship closer to _The Lariinaan_ if they wish to attempt to board it.

## SCANNING THE DERELICT

As they maneuver nearer, the adventurers will be able to make more detailed sensor scans of the Imperial battlecruiser ( roll 10+; +1 Intel 9+, +1 Educ 9+, + Computer-1, +1 Electronics-1, +2 ex-Navy, +1 ex- Scout - each success provides one piece of information to the adventurers ). They can learn the following:

- The ship shows signs of severe meteor damage on several decks. The decks with least signs of damage include the command deck, command crew deck, main weapons deck, and main engineering deck (these decks are the most heavily armored of the ship, so any ex-Navy personnel will be unsurprised that these are the decks with least damage).
- These decks are where minimum power levels can be detected, and (if the adventurers detected life signs) where the potential life signs are located.
- The damage to maneuver drive of _The Lariinaan_ is severe, so the battlecruiser will not be able to be moved out of the orbit it is currently trapped in. (Moving the battlecruiser would require a vessel capable of generating a tractor field able to move 25kT, or a vessel that could tow 25kT.)
- Some of the damage to the hull shows unusual patterning, and was definitely not caused by meteors or weapons fire. The scans are not able to provide sufficient resolution on the patterning and the exact cause cannot, therefore, be determined.
- There are several possible places to board the derelict. There are airlocks on the aft section of the command crew deck, and there is a shuttle bay located there as well. The missile tubes on the main weapons deck might provide access if they are not loaded. Finally, there are further airlocks located on the aft section of the main weapons deck and a breach in the shuttle bay on that deck.

## “ALL ABOARD!”

Once the adventurers have chosen their point of entry to The Lariinaan , the main part of the adventure begins.

![[PTri-29.jpg]]

Imperial battlecruisers are built on the same specifications, and contain the following details in common:

### Walls

Two types of wall occur—partition and bulkheads. In each area of the ship, the difference will be highlighted in the area descriptions. Partitions are non-load bearing panels fixed in place, but not pressure tight and unable to withstand a concentrated assault. A partition can be broken down (enough for a person to pass through) after it sustains 100 points of damage from an energy or explosive weapon (most ballistic pistols and rifles cannot penetrate partition walls, however, gauss weapons and rocket propelled weapons (like gyrojet pistols) can cause damage). Bulkheads are built of heavy metal, and maintain the structural integrity and environment of the ship in the face of battle or collision damage. A bulkhead is very difficult to destroy, and requires 1000 points of damage from an energy weapon or an explosive before showing a hole large enough for a person to pass through. All decks are bulkheads.

### Doors

Sliding panel doors are set in partition walls. They are not airtight and will open at the touch of a stud (if power is on), or by concentrated effort if power is off ( roll 8+; DM +1 Str 8+, +1 Electronics-1, +1 Mechanical-1, +1 each person involved ). Locks on sliding doors are for privacy only, and may be easily broken with a prybar or other tool ( roll 7+; DM +1 Str 8+, +1 Electronics-1, +1 Mechanical- 1 ).

### Iris Valves

Portals set in bulkheads are either hatches or iris valves. Iris valves are much like the aperture of a camera; they consist of a series of metal plates that slide into place to block the opening. Valves are difficult to force open once fully closed ( roll 9+; DM +1 Str 10+, +2 Dex 10+, -3 if wearing a vacc suit ); gun fire will simply lock the valve tighter; and an  open iris valve is impossible to force shut. Any strong metal object (metal bar or rod) placed in the valve, when open, will prevent full closure, and will allow a partially closed valve to be opened with ease. Iris valves are operated by depressing a stud on a switch plate on the wall near the valve. They are airtight when closed, and mark transition points to other bulkhead areas, or into airlocks. As long as the ship has any power (the ship auxiliary power source has not been disconnected), iris valves will close automatically when interior pressure drops. Vertical shaft openings are also iris valves. Iris valves can be computer controlled, and may be security doors also.

### Hatches

Hinged metal doors are placed at some locations, secured by pins operated by a handwheel on the door. These hatches cannot be controlled by the ship’s computer. There is no provision for locking hatches, but a metal rod inserted into the handwheel will jam the hatch such that it cannot be opened from the other side. Hatches may be present in floors or decks as well as in bulkhead walls.

### Vertical Shafts

Ladders leading through portals between decks are present at vertical shafts.

### Lift Shafts

Automatic elevator platforms are installed in some locations, and provide rapid transport between decks. They operate as do normal elevators.

### Power

The power plant on the engineering deck provides electrical power to the ship. Wall outlets situated throughout the ship provide connections for most uses. Such connections are Imperial standard. Light: All areas of the ship are operating on emergency lighting, illuminated in red and at reduced power levels (roughly 40% of normal lighting). Lights are controlled by a switch panel near the doors to each room, and brightness and coloration can be altered from there.

### Environment

The ship interior is maintained at a constant temperature and pressure, and oxygen levels are constantly replenished. Areas with breaches will not match the standard environmental conditions.

### Gravity

The ship decks have grav plates built-in, to provide a constant 1G floor field. Plates may be turned off through the ship’s computer. Even on emergency power, the gravity field is maintained. In addition, acceleration dampers negate the effects of acceleration while maneuvering.

## COMMAND DECK FORWARD

![[PTri-31.jpg|200]]
[[PTri-31.jpg|Command Deck Forward]]

### 1) Observation and Command Briefing Lounge

![[PTri-33.jpg|200]]
[[PTri-33.jpg|Command Briefing Lounge]]

This serves as the briefing room for the ship’s captain and their senior officers. The walls are bulkhead strength, including the glass observation wall at the front of the room. The glass wall has a sensory network running through it, which reacts to extreme conditions by making the wall opaque when necessary.

A table surrounded by eight chairs sits in the middle of the room. The captain’s chair would normally be the one nearest the observation wall. The captain’s console would also allow the captain to alter the opaqueness of the observation wall, overriding the sensory network if so desired.

The door between the briefing lounge and the bridge is a standard hatch, providing an airtight seal between the two locations.

On _The Lariinaan_ the briefing lounge is in a state of upheaval. The chairs have been scattered around the room, and long-dried blood smears stain the deck and walls. There are small amounts of yellowish staining also present on the deck and walls. The skeletal remains of one of the ship’s officers lies on the deck in the forward-starboard corner of the room, at the base of the observation wall, with a smashed spine (the officer was thrown across the room and their back impacted the observation wall with sufficient force to cause the damage). Beside the body is an automatic snub pistol. If this is checked, it is loaded with HE rounds and only three rounds remain from the twenty-clip magazine. Spent shells from the pistol can be found in the port-aft corner of the briefing room, indicating that this is the location from which the body was hurled across the room.

Searching the body will find the following:

- From the remains of the officer’s uniform the s can learn that the officer was named Taggart (if the adventurers access the ship crew t they will find out that Taggart was the Marine Commander onboard _The Lariinaan_ , and held the rank of Force Commander)
- In the remains of the combat vest worn by the officer, the adventurers will find two additional magazines for the snub pistol (one is loaded with tranqq rounds and the other with HE rounds).
- The remains of the combat vest show clear signs of e been pierced in several locations across the chest area..

### 2) Bridge

![[PTri-35.jpg|200]]
[[PTri-35.jpg|Bridge]]

Also referred to as Command-In-Control, the bridge is a large area with numerous operational stations located around the bulkhead strength walls. The perimeter of the room is lined on both sides with stations for helm, navigation, engineering, communications, sensors, beam gunnery, missile gunnery, and the ship’s spinal mount main gun.

On the central walkway is the captain’s command chair and a holographic projection unit that allows the captain to view the situation in the local area or to look at other images as needed.

At the rear of the bridge, on the starboard side, is the bridge heads. This ensures that personnel on duty do not need to exit the bridge while on duty should then need these facilities.

The route between the bridge and the remainder of the ship is through an iris valve, ensuring a greater level of security for the bridge.

The bridge acts as the control center of the ship and, for limited periods only, it is possible to run the ship with only the bridge being staffed.

On _The Lariinaan_ the bridge shows clear evidence of having been the location of a major combat. Numerous of the operational stations are covered with long-dried blood stains, as is the deck. Yellowish staining is also present on the deck, in small amounts. 

The skeletal remains of several of the ship’s crew are scattered around the bridge, some still at their stations while others are found on the walkway and near both exits of the bridge. Some of the skeletal remains have their skulls separate from their bodies. Most of the remains are attired in standard ship’s uniform from seven years previous. Two were clearly ship’s marines, as they are dressed in the remains of their shipboard combat gear and each has an advanced combat rifle near to their remains. The magazines in the rifles are both empty, and discarded casings are strewn across the deck of the bridge. Both marines have a spare magazine in the remains of their combat vests, loaded with HE rounds. 

Anyone examining the remains of the crew may learn the following ( roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Educ 9+, + Medical- 1 ):

- The decapitated skeletons show signs that the heads were ripped from the bodies..
- Marks on the skeletal marines indicate damage from claws.

### 3) Captain’s Office and Quarters

This large, well-furnished room combines the office for the ship’s captain along with their living quarters. The exterior walls are bulkhead strength as are those between the office and the bridge, The remaining walls are partition walls. The door to the living quarters is a standard sliding door but the main door to the office is an iris valve.

A large desk, behind which the captain would sit, is the main feature of the room. Behind this rests a viewscreen upon which the captain can receive and make video messages (either in local space or which can be transmitted to a local X-Boat Station for delivery elsewhere). Three chairs allow the captain to held audiences with other officers or important visitors. A bookshelf with files rests against the exterior wall.

For more informal meetings, the captain has a sofa and coffee table, along with coffee machine, located in the forward-starboard corner of the office.

The captain’s living quarters consist of a private bedroom, with dresser and wardrobe for clothing, and a personal head, with shower facilities.

On _The Lariinaan_ the captain’s quarters are in a reasonable state compared to other areas of the ship. A search of the room has the potential to reveal the following ( roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 8+, +1 Admin-1, + Streetwise- 1 ):

- There is a safe concealed behind the books on the bookshelf. Opening it requires the captain’s retinal scan ( roll 11+ to bypass retinal scan; DM + Intel 8+, +1 Computer-1, +1 Electronics-1, + Medical- 1 ). If the safe is opened, inside are the ship’s orders and the captain’s will.
- A gun was kept by the captain beneath his desk but the holster is empty.
- It is possible to access the captain’s logs from his terminal ( roll 10+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Admin-1, +1 Computer-1, +1 Electronics- 1 ). Most of the files are badly degraded but snippets indicate that the ship suffered major jump drive failure and was drawn into the strange phenomena. One final snippet reveals the ship was boarded.

### 4. Security Office

This large, well-equipped room is the ship’s security office. The exterior walls are bulkhead strength as are those between the office and the bridge, The remaining walls are partition walls. The door to the security office is an iris valve. 

From this office the ship’s chief security officer, and their team, can manage all security operations onboard, coordinating the ship’s marines with the small naval security detachment. High-priority locations, such as the bridge, the armory, and engineering, would usually have marines assigned for security. Lower priority locations, such as the ship’s mess, would be assigned personnel from the security detachment. 

Three operations stations allow the security personnel on duty in the office to monitor all the major locations onboard, ensuring that security and marines can respond quickly to any situation that might arise. The security room heads allows the personnel to maintain their duty position without needing to leave the office. A weapon cabinet is located on the forward-port wall, containing six advanced combat rifles and three magazines for each weapon. 

On The Lariinaan the weapon cabinet in the room is empty and long-dried blood stains cover the monitors and the deck. A single skeleton sits at the main monitoring station, its skull shows signs of severe trauma, having a massive area caved in. 

Anyone checking the computer records ( roll 10+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Admin-1, +1 Computer-1, + Electronics- 1 ) will find that the majority of the files are too badly degraded. Fragments reveal that the ship was boarded and the marines responded to the situation. Further fragments reveal that the attempts to defend the ship proved futile, and that the marines and crew suffered horrendous casualties as the boarders made their way through the ship. No descriptions of the boarders remain intact, nor is their any camera footage of them. However, there is recoverable camera footage which shows marines engaged in a firefight but they can be heard screaming that their weapons appear to be ineffective against the armor being worn by the boarders.

### 5) Command Deck Forward Mess

This large, open area functions as the mess/relaxation area for the duty personnel in the forward half of the command deck. The exterior walls are bulkhead strength as are those between the mess and the command deck aft. The remaining walls are partition walls. The doors leading to the command deck aft are both iris valves. The doors to the heads are sliding doors. The elevator between decks has a security locked iris valve to ensure that only authorized personnel can use the elevator to access other decks.

Seating and tables allow for members of the crew to sit and eat their meals while watching recordings on the holoscreen located on the forward wall of the area.

On _The Lariinaan_ the area has clearly been a sight of confrontation. The chairs and tables have all seen some level of damage, with one lot being overturned and strewn across the area. Spent casings from weapons fire are scattered around the area. Dried blood spatter can be seen in several areas of the deck, as can small traces of yellowish staining. There are no bodies in the area but drag marks in the blood spatter would seem to indicate bodies were pulled into the elevator at some point during the conflict ( **_roll 8+; DM +1 Intel 8+, +1 Educ 8+, +1 Streetwise-1, +1 Tactic-1,
+1 ex-Army or ex-Marine or ex-Navy - the spread of the casings and the drag marks would seem to indicate a retreat into the elevator_** ).

### 6) Command Deck Forward Galley

This area allows for the preparation and cooking of a variety of meals for members of the crew working on the command deck forward area. The exterior walls are bulkhead strength, while all remaining walls are partition walls. The doors leading to the command deck mess area are sliding doors.

Two sinks line the forward wall while three cooking/ preparation stations line the starboard wall. Along the aft wall are cold storage cabinets and cupboards containing a variety of foods for the crew.

On _The Lariinaan_ the area is still in a relatively reasonable state. However, food located in both the cold storage and cupboards has long since perished, leaving a musty smell in the area.

### COMMAND DECK AFT

[[PTri-39.jpg|Command Deck Aft]]

### 7) Command Deck Central Corridor

This long, wide corridor runs the length of the command deck aft The exterior walls are bulkhead strength as are those between the command deck aft and the command deck forward. The remaining walls are partition walls. The doors leading to the command deck forward are both iris valves. A further two iris valves lead to the hatches that connect the command deck to the rest of the ship via the central shafts. The doors to the staterooms are all sliding doors, as is the door to the officers’ lounge. 

On The Lariinaan the area shows signs that whomever boarded the ship made their way through this area. Blood stains on the deck and skeletal remains of crew members leave little to the imagination of the brutality of the boarders. 
### 8) Officer Stateroom

These staterooms function as the individual quarters for the senior officers of the crew. The exterior walls are bulkhead strength, while other walls are partition walls. Doors in the stateroom are all sliding doors. 

Each stateroom has a bed with bedside cabinet, wardrobe for clothing, and a desk and chair for the officer to work at. A sliding door leads through to the stateroom head, which has a shower, wash basin with mirror, and toilet. 

On _The Lariinaan_ the staterooms were assigned to the Executive Officer, Operations Officer, Chief Engineer, Flight Officer, Gunnery Officer, Communications Officer, Computer Officer and Security Officer. The staterooms have been individualized by them. Some rooms show that they were occupied when the assault on the ship occurred as the beds are unmade or there is paperwork strewn across the desk and deck, indicating the officer in occupancy reacted to the call to arms while otherwise engaged. 

### 9) Officers’ Lounge

This large area extends across the whole rear section of the deck. The exterior walls are bulkhead strength. The remaining walls are partition walls. The doors leading to the central corridor are sliding doors. A glass observation wall runs the length of the aft wall of the room and is of bulkhead strength. The glass wall has a sensory network running through it, which reacts to extreme conditions by making the wall opaque when necessary.

The officers’ lounge provides the ship’s officers with a location that they can relax and enjoy themselves when off-duty. There is a large holoscreen with sufficient seating for any party wishing to watch recordings, holoshows or holomovies. A multi-usage games table accommodates the opportunity to play snooker, billiards or pool, or other similar games. The officers can sit and eat at the tables provided, playing a variety of games with each other or simply chatting. A bar runs the length of the starboard side of the area, and provides the officers with access to numerous beverages, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. There is also food preparation areas behind the bar, which allows for table service to those officers desiring it.

On _The Lariinaan_ the officers’ lounge has been the scene of a major conflict. The tables are smashed and the chairs are strewn across the room. The gaming table has been overturned and thrown into the holoscreen. There are a few cartridges from weapons’ fire scattered around the area, and dried blood spatter is everywhere in the room, as are the skeletal remains of several of the crew. Only one of the bodies, located near to the entrance to the lounge, has a weapon, which is found lying near to it. The snub pistol is empty and there are no spare magazines to be found on the body.

An examination of the scene may lead to the adventurers learning something interesting, and worrying ( **_roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 9+, Educ 9+, +1 Engineering- 1 - at least some of the debris in the room appears to have been pulled towards the aft- portside bulkhead wall_** ). If this is investigated further the adventurers will likely locate one of the points of entry for the boarders ( **_roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 9+, Educ 9+, +1 Engineering-1, +1 ex-Navy or ex-Scout - one of the bulkheads has evidence of emergency bulkhead sealant being released to close a large hole in the bulkhead ). The damage to the bulkhead is not evident without a careful look but it definitely shows that a large hole was punched through the bulkhead, allowing something to enter the lounge.

### 10) Marine Squad Tactical Room/Armory

This large area functions as the tactical preparation room, and armory, for the first and second marine squads. All the walls are bulkhead strength and the door leading to the Marine Area corridor is an iris valve. 

The weapons for the first and second marine squads are held here for security. Racks and locked cabinets line the walls, containing the weapons and armor for the two marine squads stationed on this deck. This includes 4 PGMP-13s, 2 RAM auto-grenade launchers, 2 LMGs, 10 SMGs, 12 advanced combat rifles, 22 auto pistols, 22 snub pistols, and 2 laser carbines. There are also 22 sets of combat armor, and ammunition, power packs, holsters and other equipment present in the room. 

A tactical table fills the central area of the room, and can be used to project scans of locations for the marines to make tactical plans before engaging in combat. The table can also be used to monitor the marines while they are in combat, and this information can be relayed to the holoprojector on the bridge. 

On _The Lariinaan_ the majority of the weapons, combat armor, and other equipment are not to be found in the armory. The only weapons that remain are the PGMP-13s, the grenade launchers and the LMGs. Any ex- Marine or ex-Navy will understand that these weapons are unsuitable for shipboard usage There is ammunition and power packs for all the weapons that would normally be found in the armory. 

### 11) Marine Area Corridor

This corridor runs the length of the forward half of the Command Crew Deck Forward. The walls to port and starboard are partition walls, with sliding doors leading into the marine squads’ sleeping quarters. The doors to fore and aft are both iris valves, the forward leads to the Marine Squad Tactical Room/Armory and the aft leads to the Main Crew Mess area. 

On _The Lariinaan_ this corridor is empty, and there is no indication of combat taking place in this location. The deck is unmarked and there is nothing of note.

![[PTri-44.jpg]]
### 12) Marine Squad Barracks

This area functions as the living quarters for a squad of ten marines. The exterior walls are bulkhead strength, while other walls are partition walls. The door accessing the Marine Area Corridor is a sliding door, as is the door to the barracks’ fresher and heads..

Each of the ten-person squad has an individual bed with storage space underneath for personal effects, personal clothing, and uniform. At the aft section of the barracks is the heads and fresher facilities, providing the marine squad with the basics to maintain their sanitary health.

On _The Lariinaan_ the barracks show signs that they were occupied when the assault on the ship occurred as some of the beds are slightly unkempt, indicating that someone was lying upon the bed at the time the alert was sounded.

### 13) Ship’s Crew Mess

This large, open area functions as the mess area for the personnel assigned to this deck. The exterior walls are bulkhead strength as are those between the mess and the command crew deck aft. The remaining walls are partition walls. The doors leading to the marine area corridor and the command crew deck aft are all iris valves. The elevator between decks has a security locked iris valve to ensure that only authorized personnel can use the elevator to access other decks. Seating and tables allow for members of the crew to sit and eat their meals.

On _The Lariinaan_ the area has clearly been a sight of confrontation. The chairs and tables have all seen some level of damage, with one lot being overturned and strewn across the area. Spent casings from weapons fire are scattered around the area. Dried blood spatter can be seen in several areas of the deck, as can small traces of yellowish staining. 

### 14) Main Galley

This area allows for the preparation and cooking of a variety of meals for members of the crew stationed on the command crew deck forward and aft. The exterior walls are bulkhead strength, while all remaining walls are partition walls. The doors leading to the command crew deck mess area are sliding doors. 

Two sinks line the forward wall while three cooking/ preparation stations line the port wall. Along the aft wall are cold storage cabinets and cupboards containing a variety of foods for the crew. Located on the starboard wall are two automatic food dispensers, which would normally contain a variety of meals that the crew could order to eat. These meals would be heated, if necessary, and then delivered to the crew member who had ordered the food. 

On _The Lariinaan_ the area is still in a relatively reasonable state. However, food located in the cold storage, cupboards, and the dispensing machines has long since perished, leaving a musty smell in the area. 

### 15) Sick Bay

This area is the ship’s primary medical facility. The exterior walls are bulkhead strength, while all remaining walls are partition walls. All doors in the sick bay are sliding doors.

The medical facilities are of the finest quality, allowing the medical staff to provide essential care to the crew in any circumstance. There are three monitoring beds against the starboard wall, and an operating table is located centrally in the area. There is a workstation for use by the on-duty medical personnel and a fully stocked pharmacy.

On _The Lariinaan_ the sick bay is in a considerable state. Blood stains and drag marks indicate that wounded personnel were brought her for treatment. All three monitoring beds have the remains of a crew member lying upon them. If the adventurers try, they may be able to access the medical records from the monitoring bed computers ( **_roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Educ 9+, +1 Admin-1, +1 Computer-1, +1 Medical- 1 - the individuals on the monitoring beds all died from extensive blood loss caused by severe lacerations from a physical assault_** ).

### 16) Emergency Cryogenics

This area is the ship’s emergency cryogenics facility. The exterior walls are bulkhead strength as is the forward wall between this area and the marines’ area. All remaining walls are partition walls. All The door between sick bay and the emergency cryogenics is a sliding door.

The five cryogenic beds in this area allow the medical personnel to place severely injured crew members, or crew members with medical conditions that the ship’s medical facilities cannot treat, into cryogenic suspension, ensuring they can survive until the ship reaches a better equipped medical facility that may be able to save the crew member. A monitoring station allows the medical personnel to maintain the condition of any crew placed into the cryogenic beds. 

On _The Lariinaan_ the five beds are all occupied and operating at minimal power. If the adventurers check the monitoring station they may learn more ( **_roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Educ 9+, +1 Computer-1, +1 Medical- 1 - only two of the five individuals are still alive but in deep cryogenic suspension_** ). Waking the individuals while still on _The Lariinaan_ is not an option as they would likely not survive the procedure without proper medical facilities and staff available to help them recover. Taking the two cryogenic beds back to an Imperial medical facility would be the best option to allow the crew members to survive being revived. 

The individuals in the surviving cryogenic beds are the ship’s captain and the ship’s senior surgeon. If the captain is revived successfully, the adventures will be eligible for the reward offered by his family.

The remaining walls are partition walls. The doors leading to the command crew deck forward are both iris valves. A further two iris valves lead to the hatches that connect the command crew deck to the rest of the ship via the central shafts. The doors to the staterooms are all sliding doors, while the door to the Marine Drop Shuttle Bay is an iris valve.

On _The Lariinaan_ the area shows signs that whomever boarded the ship made their way through this area. Blood stains on the deck and skeletal remains of crew members, a mix of marines in combat armor and other personnel, are clear evidence of the conflict that occurred in this area. Discarded cartridges are scattered around the deck and most of the weapons have been ripped apart.

With a careful search the adventurers may be able to find some salvageable equipment ( roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Streetwose-1, +1 Tactics- 1 - amongst the marine corpses the adventurers find two snub pistols and one auto pistol, with two magazines of ammunition for each handgun ).

### 18) Junior Officer Stateroom

These staterooms function as the dual-occupancy quarters for the junior officers of the crew. The exterior walls are bulkhead strength, while other walls are partition walls. Doors in the stateroom are all sliding doors.

Each stateroom has two beds with a bedside cabinet each, and two wardrobes for clothing. A sliding door leads through to the stateroom head, which has a shower, wash basin with mirror, and toilet.

On _The Lariinaan_ the staterooms were assigned to the various junior officers, including the senior members of the marine squads stationed on this deck.

Each stateroom has been individualized by the occupants. Some rooms show that they were occupied when the assault on the ship occurred as the beds are e, indicating the officers in occupancy reacted to the call to arms while sleeping. 

### 19) Marine Drop Shuttle Bay

This large area extends across the whole rear section of the deck. The exterior walls are bulkhead strength as are the walls connecting to the rest of the ship. The door leading to the central corridor is an iris valve, as are the two doors leading to the airlocks found to port and starboard. 

This area is where the marines have their two drop shuttles. Facilities in the area allow for the maintenance and repair of the drop vehicles. There are two large doors that allow the drop vehicles to enter or leave the ship when necessary. The area is airtight and the atmosphere can be evacuated, allowing the drop shuttles to exit the ship in space. The airlocks to port and starboard both have vacc suit storage facilities, and allow crew members to enter and exit the ship while in space. 

On _The Lariinaan_ the area shows signs of severe damage. The two drop shuttles are tipped on their sides, and there are casings from gun fire all over the area. Blood stains cover the deck, and the remains of several marines are scattered around the bay. 

Upon entering the bay, the adventurers will notice that the temperature in the bay is well below freezing point, and they will start to suffer the effects of exposure within minutes if they are not wearing protective clothing or a vacc suit ( **_suffer 1d damage per minute after three minutes in the area_** ). 

The other major thing that the adventurers will find in this area are four 7’ crystalline cocoons located in the middle of the bay. Investigating these may provide interesting results ( _**roll 10+; DM +1 Intel 10+, +1 Engineering-1, +1 Medical-1, +1 Vacc Suit- 1 - the crystalline structure acts as a insulator and there are signs that there is something inside each cocoon that is still alive, although in a state of intense hibernation**_ ). The cocoons each contain one ancient [[Droyne]] warrior. Nothing the adventurers possess can damage the crystalline cocoons. The cocoons will open, after ten minutes, if the temperature in the bay is increased.

The consoles can be reactivated ( ***roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Educ 9+, +1 Computer-1, +1 Electronics- 1*** ) and if this is done, they will provide information on the beam lasers on _The Lariinaan_. The port side lasers are in a fully operational status. 

### 24) Weapons Deck Mid Corridor

This corridor runs the length of the mid-section of the Weapons Deck Forward. All the walls are bulkhead strength and the doors leading to the Forward Corridor, Computer Control, Communications and Sensors Control, and the Central Access Area are iris valves. 

On _The Lariinaan_ the area shows signs that whoever boarded the ship made their way through this area. Blood stains on the deck and skeletal remains of crew members, a mix of marines in combat armor and other personnel, are clear evidence of the conflict that occurred in this area. Discarded cartridges are scattered around the deck and most of the weapons have been ripped apart. 

With a careful search the adventurers may be able to find some salvageable equipment ( ***roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Streetwose-1, +1 Tactics- 1 - amongst the marine corpses the adventurers find one snub pistol and two auto pistols, with two magazines of ammunition for each handgun*** ).

### 25) Computer Control Room

This large room is the ship’s computer control room. All the walls are bulkhead strength and the door leading to the Weapons Deck mid corridor is an iris valve.

The room has four computer access/control consols and several emergency memory storage banks. The personnel working in this area can monitor orders sent to the computer from anywhere in the ship, and can cancel any order if they have the proper authorization from the Computer Officer. This action is only taken if an order clearly breaches ship safety or does not have the correct authorization codes attached.

Although this room allows the crew to monitor and control the ship’s computer, the actual computer is located on another level entirely.

On _The Lariinaan_ this area is another that has seen conflict. The skeletal remains of three crew members are scattered around the room, including one of a marine. Old bloodstains cover the deck, consoles and memory banks, and there are traces of yellow staining on the deck as well. Spent casings are also scattered throughout the room.

The adventurers can attempt to access the ship’s computer and its records from this room ( ***roll 10+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Educ 9+, +1 Admin-1, +1 Computer-1, +1 Electronics-1*** ). Success provides access to the following:

- The files are badly degraded but the back-up storage provides better quality recordings of the files.
- The engineering officer’s log provides more details about the jump failure. The ship encountered a large, electromagnetic phenomena while in jump space which resulted in jump failure. The failure caused catastrophic damage to the jump drive and also damaged other systems. The engineering officer notes that repairs are ongoing but that the jump drive cannot be repaired until they reach a Naval base.
- The communication officer’s log notes that the electromagnetic phenomena has disrupted all long-range communications, preventing the sending of a distress call. However, distress beacons have been released and will hopefully alert nearby ships to the situation.
- The captain’s logs mention _The Lariinaan_ being drawn into a spatial anomaly, and indicate that the captain had considered abandoning ship but was unwilling to do so when they were uncertain as to the ship’s location due to the anomaly.
- The last log from the captain states that the ship is being boarded and that he has ordered the ship’s marines to repel the boarders.

![[PTri-54.jpg|200]]
[[PTri-54.jpg|Comms and Sensors]]
### 26) Communications and Sensors Control Room

This large room is the ship’s communications and sensors control room. All the walls are bulkhead strength and the door leading to the Weapons Deck mid corridor is an iris valve.

There are three consoles assigned to monitor the ship’s sensors and four stations assigned to communications. The Communications Officer can monitor all of the information passing through these stations from their central console. The communications systems onboard allow for transmitting messages throughout the shup, sending transmissions to any of the ship’s smaller craft, monitoring local system communications, and maintaining communication links with any ship’s personnel that are planetside.

On _The Lariinaan_ this area is another that has seen conflict. The skeletal remains of five crew members are scattered around the room, including two marines. Old bloodstains cover the deck and consoles, and there are traces of yellow staining on the deck as well. Spent casings are also scattered throughout the room.

The adventurers can attempt to access the ship’s sensors and its communication logs from this room( ***roll 10+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Educ 9+, +1 Computer- 1, +1 Electronics-1*** ). Success provides access to the following:

- The same information that the adventures can gain access to by performing sensor scans on their own ship is also available here.
- The sensor logs confirm that the anomaly opening decays after a period of 12 to 15 hours but will decay quicker if disrupted by an electromagnetic source.
- Sensor logs record a nuclear detonation at the edge of the anomaly, causing it to collapse. 
- Internal sensor logs indicate that the ship was boarded by four creatures. Scans indicate that the creatures were large, winged and semi-reptilian in nature. The closest Imperium species that bears any resemblance to these would be Droyne.
- Shipboard communications logs from after the boarding are sporadic and largely incoherent. Marines reporting ineffectiveness of their weapons against the creatures. Screams of panic and despair, shouts including “They’ve just ripped Jeckson in two!” and “They’re unstoppable!” can also be heard.
- The emergency beacon from _The Lariinaan_ is routed through this area. 
### 27) Central Access Area

This large area allows access to the weapons deck aft, as well as access to other decks by the elevator. The exterior walls are bulkhead strength as are those between the rest of the weapon deck forward and the weapon deck aft. The walls separating the heads are partition walls. The doors leading to the weapons deck mid corridor and the weapons deck aft are all iris valves. Sliding doors allow access to the heads located on this deck. The elevator between decks has a security locked iris valve to ensure that only authorized personnel can use the elevator to access other decks.

On _The Lariinaan_ the area has clearly been a sight of confrontation. Spent casings from weapons fire are scattered around the area. Dried blood spatter can be seen in several areas of the deck, as can small traces of yellowish staining.

### 28) Weapons’ Deck Heads

The exterior walls are bulkhead strength as are those between the rest of the weapon deck forward and the weapon deck aft. The walls separating the heads from the central access area are partition walls. Sliding doors allow access to the central access area. These heads provide the ship’s crew with the basics to maintain their sanitary health. 

On _The Lariinaan_ these areas are empty, and there is no indication of combat taking place in these locations. The deck is unmarked and there is nothing of note.


## MAIN WEAPONS DECK AFT

![[PTri-59.jpg|200]]
[[PTri-59.jpg|Main Weapons Deck Aft]]
### 29) Central Access Area Aft

This area allows access to the weapons deck aft, as well as access to other decks by the hatches that connect the weapons deck to the rest of the ship via the central shafts, with iris valves allowing access to the central access area. The exterior walls are bulkhead strength as are those between the weapon deck forward and the rest of the weapon deck aft.

On _The Lariinaan_ the area has clearly been a sight of confrontation. Spent casings from weapons fire are scattered around the area. Dried blood spatter can be seen in several areas of the deck, as can small traces of yellowish staining and there are three skeletal remains of marines spread across the area. The iris valve between the central access area and the weapons deck aft corridor shows signs of damage, with claw marks clearly visible across its surface.

With a careful search the adventurers may be able to find some salvageable equipment ( roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Streetwose-1, +1 Tactics- 1 - amongst the marine corpses the adventurers find three magazines, one of which is HEAP, of ammunition for an ACR ).

### 30. Weapons Deck Aft Corridor

This corridor runs the length of the forward half of the Weapons Deck Aft. The walls to port and starboard are partition walls, with sliding doors leading into the marine squads’ sleeping quarters. The doors to fore and aft are both iris valves, the forward leads to the Central Access Area Aft and the aft leads to the Marine Squad Tactical Room/Armory. 

On _The Lariinaan_ this corridor is filled with devastation. Several skeletal corpses are strewn around the corridor. The number of corpses is not instantly be calculated as the skeletons are not all complete. A quick count of skulls indicates that seven marines lost their lives in this corridor. Dried blood stains the walls and deck, with small amounts of yellowish spatter throughout the area. Spent casing from weapons fire are everywhere in the corridor. 

With a careful search the adventurers may be able to find some salvageable equipment ( ***roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Streetwose-1, +1 Tactics- 1 - amongst the marine corpses the adventurers find one intact ACR with two magazine for it found amongst the remains, and a snub auto pistol with one HE magazine*** ).

### 31) Marine Squad Barracks
![[PTri-57.jpg|200]]
[[PTri-57.jpg|Bunks]]
Each of these areas functions as the living quarters for a squad of ten marines. The exterior walls are bulkhead strength, while other walls are partition walls. The door accessing the Weapons Deck Aft Corridor is a sliding door, as is the door to the barracks’ fresher and heads.

Each of the ten-person squad has an individual bed, organized in two tiers one-above the other, with storage space underneath for personal effects, personal clothing, and uniform. At the aft section of the barracks is the heads and fresher facilities, providing the marine squad with the basics to maintain their sanitary health.

On _The Lariinaan_ the barracks show signs that they were occupied when the assault on the ship occurred as some of the beds are slightly unkempt, indicating that someone was lying upon the bed at the time the alert was sounded.

### 32) Marine Squad Tactical Room/Armory

This large area functions as the tactical preparation room, and armory, for the third and fourth marine squads. All the walls are bulkhead strength and the door leading to the Weapons Deck Aft corridor is an iris valve as is the door leading to the Marine Drop Shuttle Bay.

The weapons for the third and fourth marine squads are held here for security. Racks and locked cabinets line the walls, containing the weapons and armor for the two marine squads stationed on this deck. This includes 4 PGMP-13s, 2 RAM auto-grenade launchers, 2 LMGs, 10 SMGs, 12 advanced combat rifles, 22 auto pistols, 22 snub pistols, and 2 laser carbines. There are also 22 sets of combat armor, and ammunition, power packs, holsters and other equipment present in the room.

A tactical table fills the central area of the room and can be used to project scans of locations for the marines to make tactical plans before engaging in combat. The table can also be used to monitor the marines while they are in combat, and this information can be relayed to the holoprojector on the bridge.

On _The Lariinaan_ the majority of the weapons, combat armor, and other equipment are not to be found in the armory. The only weapons that remain are the PGMP- 13s, the grenade launchers and the LMGs. Any ex- Marine or ex-Navy will understand that these weapons are unsuitable for shipboard usage There is ammunition and power packs for all the weapons that would normally be found in the armory. 

The area also shows signs of heavy conflict, with the skeletal remains of marines thrown all over the room. The cabinets, walls and decks are all covered in dried blood stains, and there are small areas of yellowish staining also evident. Spent casings are everywhere underfoot although there is an unusually large buildup of casings at the iris valve leading to the Marine Drop Shuttle Bay. The way that the skeletons are distributed indicates that these marines were torn apart by their assailants. Both iris valves show signs of heavy damage from claws. 

The iris valve to the Marine Drop Shuttle Bay is sealed, and the indicators on the door show that the area beyond is in vacuum. Overriding the lock is possible ( ***roll 10+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Educ 9+, +1 Computer- 1, +1 Electronics- 1*** ). If the iris valve is opened, the casings, and any other loose items in the room, will immediately be drawn towards the aft as the atmosphere starts to vent into the Marine Drop Shuttle Bay. If the adventures first reduce the atmosphere in the Tactical Room ( ***roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Educ 9+, +1 Computer-1, +1 Electronic-1, +1 Vacc Suit- 1*** ) then this will not happen. 

### 33) Marine Drop Shuttle Bay

This large area extends across the whole rear section of the deck. The exterior walls are bulkhead strength as are the walls connecting to the rest of the ship. The door leading to the Marine Squad Tactical Room/ Armory is an iris valve, as are the two doors leading to the airlocks found to port and starboard. 

This area is where the marines have their two drop shuttles. Facilities in the area allow for the maintenance and repair of the drop vehicles. There are two large doors that allow the drop vehicles to enter or leave the ship when necessary. The area is airtight and the atmosphere can be evacuated, g the drop shuttles to exit the ship in space. The airlocks to port and starboard both have vacc suit storage facilities, and allow crew members to enter and exit the ship while in space.

On _The Lariinaan_ this area is one of the locations where the battle cruiser was breached. The portside bulkhead wall is severely damaged, with a hole in it sufficiently large enough to allow entry to the Shuttle Bay for a large humanoid being ( roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Engineering-1, +1 Mechanical- 1 - the damage was caused from a force outside the ship and it appears that the bulkhead was peeled apart to allow entry ).

The bay is in vacuum and most portable items were long ago sucked out into space when the area decompressed upon being breached.

The two shuttles also show signs of severe damage, with one having been overturned and thrown into the other. Neither are in a state to be made use of without major repairs being carried out.

The iris valve to the Marine Squad Tactical Room/ Armory is sealed, and the indicators on the door show that the area beyond is pressurized at one atmosphere. Overriding the lock is possible ( ***roll 10+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Educ 9+, +1 Computer-1, +1 Electronics- 1*** ). If the iris valve is opened, the casings, and any other loose items in the tactical room, will immediately be drawn towards the aft as the atmosphere starts to vent into the Marine Drop Shuttle Bay. If the adventures first reduce the atmosphere in the Tactical Room ( **_roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Educ 9+, +1 Computer-1, +1 Electronic-1, +1 Vacc Suit- 1 ) then this will not happen.

If the adventurers examine the iris valve between the bay and the tactical room ,they will notice that it has also sustained some damage ( **_roll 10+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Educ 8+, +1 Electronics-1, +1 Engineering-1, +1 Mechanical- 1_** ). The iris valve shows signs of having been forced open at a previous time. There are indentations on the surface of the iris valve that suggest a creature of immense strength held the valve open, and even forced it to open further. There are also clear indications of claw marks upon the surface of the iris valve.

## ENGINEERING DECK FORWARD
![[PTri-63.jpg|200]]
[[PTri-63.jpg|Engineering Deck Forward]]
### 34. Engineering Control Center

This large area functions as the Engineering control center. All the walls are bulkhead strength and the door leading to the Engineering Deck Forward corridor is an iris valve. 

Computer control consoles line the room, providing the crew with detailed information on the performance of the ship’s power plant, maneuver drives and jump drive. The engineers on duty can also monitor power distribution across the whole ship, anticipating spikes in power requirements and ensuring that the crews’ needs are adequately met. 

On _The Lariinaan_ this area is empty, and there is no indication of combat taking place in this location. The deck is unmarked and there is nothing of note. The consoles can be reactivated ( ***roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Educ 9+, +1 Computer-1, +1 Electronics- 1*** ) and if this is done, they will provide information on the current state of the ship’s engines and power plant on _The Lariinaan_. The power plant is working at emergency power levels but fuel reserves are running low, and without fresh fuel the output from the power plant cannot be raised without risking the lives of all the crew in emergency hibernation ( ***roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Educ 9+, +1 Electronics-1, +1 Medical- 1*** ). The maneuver drive and the jump drive have both suffered severe damage and would require a major overhaul at a naval facility before any possibility of ever becoming operational again ( ***roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 8+, +1 Engineering-1, +1 ex-Navy*** ). 

### 35) Engineering Deck Forward Corridor

This corridor runs the length of the forward half of the Engineering Deck Forward. The walls between this area and the Engineering Control Center and the Engineering Crew Recreation Area are bulkhead strength, and the doors leading to these areas are iris valves. The walls between the corridor and the Crew Quarters are partition walls, and the doors are sliding doors.

On _The Lariinaan_ this area is empty, and there is no indication of combat taking place in this location. The deck is unmarked and there is nothing of note.

![[PTri-65.jpg]]
### 36) Crew Quarters

These staterooms function as the dual-occupancy quarters for the junior engineering officers of the crew. The exterior walls are bulkhead strength, while other walls are partition walls. Doors in the stateroom are all sliding doors.

Each stateroom has two beds with a bedside cabinet each, and two wardrobes for clothing. A sliding door leads through to the stateroom head, which has two showers, wash basin with mirror, and two toilets.

On _The Lariinaan_ the staterooms were assigned to the various junior engineering officers stationed on this deck.

Each stateroom has been individualized by the occupants. Some rooms show that they were occupied when the assault on the ship occurred as the beds are unmade, indicating the officers in occupancy reacted to the call to arms while sleeping.

### 37) Engineering Officer’s Office and Quarters

This large, well-furnished room combines the office for the ship’s senior engineering officer along with their living quarters. The exterior walls are bulkhead strength as are those between the office and the forward section of the engineering deck, The remaining walls are partition walls. The door to the living quarters is a standard sliding door as is the main door to the office. 

A large desk, behind which the engineering officer would sit, is the main feature of the room. Three chairs allow the engineering officer to held audiences with other officers. A bookshelf with files rests against the exterior wall. 

For more informal meetings, the engineering officer has two sofas and coffee table, along with coffee machine, located in the rearward-starboard corner of the office. The engineering officer’s living quarters consist of a private bedroom, with dresser and wardrobe for clothing, and a personal head, with shower facilities. 

On _The Lariinaan_ the engineering officer’s quarters are in a reasonable state compared to other areas of the ship. A search of the room has the potential to reveal the following ( ***roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 8+, +1 Admin-1, +1 Streetwise- 1*** ):

- There is a safe concealed behind the books on the bookshelf. Opening it requires the engineering officer’s retinal scan ( ***roll 11+ to bypass retinal scan; DM +1 Intel 8+, +1 Computer-1, +1 Electronics-1, +1 Medical- 1*** ). If the safe is opened, inside is the engineering officer’s will.
- It is possible to access the engineering officer’s   logs from his terminal ( ***roll 10+; DM +1 Intel 9+,+1 Admin-1, +1 Computer-1, +1 Electronics- 1*** ). Most of the files are badly degraded but snippets indicate that the ship suffered major jump drive failure and was drawn into the strange phenomena. The engineering officer also notes that the level of damage sustained means that the ship does not have the facilities to enact even a temporary repair.

### 38) Maintenance Workshop

This large area is the ship’s maintenance workshop. The exterior walls are bulkhead strength as are those between the workshop and the forward part of the engineering deck. The remaining walls are partition walls. The doors leading to the engineering deck recreation area is a sliding door, as is the door leading to the workshop heads.

There are workstations lining the walls of the workshop, allowing engineering personnel to carry out complex repairs to components and circuitry, as well as allowing them to construct new components when necessary (although this facility is limited). In the center of the room is a holographic planning table, allowing the engineers to examine components in more detail using holographic imaging.

On _The Lariinaan_ this area is empty, and there is no indication of combat taking place in this location. The deck is unmarked and there is nothing of note. 
The workstations and holographic table can be reactivated ( ***roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Educ 9+, +1 Computer-1,+1 Electronics- 1*** ) and this may allow the adventurers with a way to repair the parts they need for their ship ( ***roll 11+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Educ 9+, +1 Computer- 1, +1 Electronics-1, +1 Engineering-1, +1 Mechanical- 1*** ) or to examine, and fix, parts they have salvaged from other areas of the ship ( ***roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Educ 9+, +1 Computer-1, +1 Electronics- 1, +1 Engineering-1, +1 Mechanical- 1*** ). 

Repairs to any components will take d6 hours to complete. However, this time can potentially be reduced (*** roll 10+; DM +1 Intel 10+, +1 Educ 9+, +1 Electronics-1, +1 Engineering-1, +1 Mechanical- 1 - reduce time to complete the repairs by 30 minutes for each point by which this roll is successful with a minimum time to complete repairs of 30 minutes*** ). Any engineer will know that repairs are only temporary, and a major overhaul of any repaired systems will be necessary as soon as possible at a planet with a C+ Starport.
![[PTri-67.jpg]]
### 39) Engineering Crew Recreation Area

This large, open area functions as the relaxation area for the duty personnel on the engineering deck. The exterior walls are bulkhead strength as are those between the recreation area and the engineering deck aft. The remaining walls are partition walls. The doors leading to the engineering deck aft are both iris valves. The elevator between decks has a security locked iris valve to ensure that only authorized personnel can use the elevator to access other decks.

Seating and tables allow for members of the crew to sit and relax, while watching recordings on holo- screens embedded into the tables, or playing games.

On _The Lariinaan_ the area has clearly been a sight of confrontation. The chairs and tables have all seen some level of damage, with one lot being overturned and strewn across the area. Spent casings from weapons fire are scattered around the area. Dried blood spatter can be seen in several areas of the deck, as can small traces of yellowish staining.

## ENGINEERING DECK AFT

![[PTri-69.jpg|200]]
[[PTri-69.jpg|Engineering Deck Aft]]
### 40) Engineering Deck Aft Access Area

This area allows access to the engineering deck aft, as well as access to other decks by the hatches that connect the engineering deck to the rest of the ship via the central shafts, with iris valves allowing access to the central access area. The exterior walls are bulkhead strength as are those between the engineering deck forward and the rest of the engineering deck aft.

On _The Lariinaan_ the area has clearly been a sight of confrontation. Spent casings from weapons fire are scattered around the area. Dried blood spatter can be seen in several areas of the deck, as can small traces of yellowish staining and there are two skeletal remains of marines spread across the area. The iris valve between the central access area and the engineering deck aft shows signs of damage, with claw marks clearly visible across its surface.

With a careful search the adventurers may be able to find some salvageable equipment ( roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Streetwose-1, +1 Tactics- 1 - amongst the marine corpses the adventurers find two magazines, one of which is HEAP, of ammunition for an ACR ). 

### 41) Main Engineering Area

This large area takes up the majority of the engineering deck aft. The exterior walls are bulkhead strength as are those between main engineering and the engineering deck access area. The door between the two areas is an iris valve. 

The majority of the area is taken up by the ship’s power plant, and portions of the ship’s maneuver and jump drives. There are computer stations dotted around the engineering area, allowing engineers to monitor drive and power plant output and performance. 

On _The Lariinaan_ the area has been the sight of a major incident. There is clear evidence that the jump drive suffered a catastrophic jump failure. Marks on the deck indicate an explosion occurred which would have likely injured, or killed, engineers working in the area (if the adventurers have accessed the ship’s logs the information regarding the explosion is amongst the degraded files). Any engineer examining the drives will be able to determine that both the maneuver drive and jump drive are irreparable without access to a Naval base ( ***roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 8+, +1 Educ 9+, +1 Electronics-1, +1 Engineering-1, +1 Mechanical- 1*** ). 

The power plant is working at emergency levels but it would be possible to bring it back online ( ***roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 8+, +1 Educ 9+, +1 Electronics-1, +1 Engineering-1, +1 Mechanical- 1*** ). However, the plant will only work on full power for d6 hours due to limited fuel reserves. Additionally, the reset required will also result in the temperature in the Marine Drop Shuttle Bay on the Command Crew Deck being returned to normal (resulting in the cocoons located there opening after ten minutes). 

A search of the deck may result in the adventurers finding the components they need to repair their ship, although these components may need to be worked on in the Workshop ( ***roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 8+, +1 Educ 8+, +1 Electronics-1, +1 Engineering-1, +1 Mechanical- 1, +1 Streetwise- 1 - if roll succeeds by more than 6 then the piece found is in working order, otherwise it will need repaired first in the workshop*** ).

##### TIMINGS

As the adventurers may be aware, there is a clock running down on them throughout the course of their time in the voidspace. The pressure of time needs to be made clear to the adventurers throughout. This can be done by subtle reminders:

- Their ship computer will issue them with a   reminder every hour.
- Places that allow for exterior views will allow  them to see the aperture to real-space, and each time it should be impressed upon them, that the aperture is getting smaller (locations where they can view the aperture include [[#1) Observation and Command Briefing Lounge|the Bridge Briefing Room]], the [[#3) Captain’s Office and Quarters|Captain’s Office]], [[#36) Crew Quarters|Crew Quarters]] on the portside of the ship, [[#31) Marine Squad Barracks|Marine Barracks]] on portside of the ship, plus others as necessary).
- If they remain in vacc suits, their suits will remind them hourly of amount of oxygen remaining.
- Other reminders as determined by yourself.

Searching an area takes time, depending on the quality of the search:

- Quick search - 5 minutes
- More complete search - 10 minutes
- Complete search - 20 minutes

Accessing computer records and other activities will also take time:

- Accessing computer logs - 5 to 10 minutes
- Examining remains - 5 to 10 minutes

If the adventurers are careful and keep track of the time, then there is no reason that they should become trapped within the voidspace. However, if they choose to do complete searches of every area, check every computer log and examine every body, and show no concerns about how long they are taking, then having them become trapped in the voidspace may be the appropriate course of action.

Escaping the voidspace, and its inherent threats, then becomes a completely different situation beyond the scope of this adventure. Remember, _The Lariinaan_ has been trapped in voidspace for seven years, so escape is not easy. 

# An Awakening

When _The Lariinaan_ suffered its drive failure and was drawn into the [[Phlume Triangle|Triangle]], it found itself being boarded by four Ancient Droyne Warriors. The warriors broke through the hull at different points and made their way through the ship, killing indiscriminately as they did so. To the horror of the crew and the marines onboard, the warriors proved to be highly resistant to weapons fire.

By chance, the chief medical officer developed a working theory on how to stop the creatures. Working alongside the Chief Engineer, they devised a lure to draw the warriors to into the Marine Drop Shuttle Bay on the Command Crew deck. A fierce battle ensued between the few surviving marines and the warriors. Once all four warriors were in the bay, the chief engineer stopped all life support to the area and pumped in cryogenic gases. The surviving marines, aware of the plan, quickly made their escape from the bay. The rapid change in temperature, along with the cryogenic gases, forced the warriors into a protective hibernation state, and each spun a crystalline cocoon around themselves to protect them further. 

Although the threat had been eliminated, the ship had suffered too much damage for the surviving crew to be able to make any repairs. The captain made the call to place all surviving crew into cryogenic sleep and the chief engineering rigged the ship’s systems to ensure that the distress beacon and the cryopods would receive a continuous flow of power, potentially for up to one hundred years. 

Unfortunately, for the adventurers, the Ancient Droyne Warriors could still pose a threat to them. Upon boarding _The Lariinaan_ , the adventurers may, very likely will, find themselves causing the warriors to awaken. Luckily for the adventurers, the warriors are weakened from their hibernation and three of them will depart the ship immediately. The remaining warrior, however, starts to explore the ship, hoping to find any survivors left onboard.

![[PTri-74.jpg|200]]
[[PTri-74.jpg|The Creature]]

The warrior will use the access hatches to make its way between the decks, using its immense strength to force open the iris valves. It will use its rudimentary psionic ability to sense life to allow it to locate the adventurers, and then it will stalk them before attacking at the earliest opportunity. As this ability is very basic, any adventurer with psionic training may realize that they are being “scanned” ( ***roll 5+; DM +1 Psi Strength 8+*** ).

When the adventurers finally encounter the warrior, they will see a lizard-like creature that is over 2m in height with a dense muscularity, that has two large, bat-like wings protruding from its back. The warrior’s hide is dark green in coloration, with a buff colored, carapace chest area. Its hands are claw-like, with gleaming talons. If the adventurers have examined any of the dead crew, they will realize that these talons are likely the cause of the piercing injuries that the dead crew suffered.

If fired upon, and hit, the warrior will use its wings like a shield, providing it with resistance to projectile damage (the wings reduce damage from projectile weapons by 4 points - for every 4 points the wings reduce, their structural integrity is lowered by 1, and they start with a structural integrity of 10, and regenerate 1 point of integrity every other turn).

The warrior, once given the opportunity, will engage the adventurers in melee combat, using its talons to deal as much damage as it can.

Given the lethality of the warrior, the adventurers will likely want to try and figure out some other way to deal with it. If they have been paying attention, they may realize that it is susceptible to extreme cold ( ***roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Educ 9+, +1 Medical-1, +1 if they saw the cocoons*** ). If they do not realize this, then have a stray shot cause a release of a cold gas which the warrior will recoil from.

Once the adventurers know the weakness, they need to construct a weapon, which can be done in the Workshop or any other area by a competent engineer (***roll 10+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Educ 9+, +1 Electronics- 1, +1 Engineering-1, +1 Mechanical-1, +1 in Workshop***). The weapon will have d6 shots, and will need one hit to make the warrior to enter hibernation.

# Escaping The Triangle

Having completed their search of _The Lariinaan_ , and having dealt with the Droyne warrior onboard, the adventurers can return to their own starship to attempt temporary repairs. Sadly, as they will have learned, _The Lariinaan_ does not have the fuel that they need for their starship.

At all times, it needs to be made clear to the adventurers that they are against a clock, as the phenomena is collapsing.

##### EXECUTING “GETTING THE HELL OUT OF HERE”

Assuming the adventurers have found the necessary components, and if they have not then escape will not be possible, then they can attempt the repair to their jump drive ( ***roll 10+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Educ 9+, +1 Electronics-1, +1 Engineering-1, +1 Mechanical- 1 - the repair takes d3 hours, less 30 minutes for each point of success, to a minimum of 30 minutes*** ).

During this time, it should be impressed upon the adventurers that the aperture to normal space is very obviously shrinking. Additionally, anyone checking sensors might detect the approach of a further threat ( **_toll 9+; DM +1 Intel 8+, +1 Educ 8+, +1 Computer-1,+1 Electronics-1, +1 Navigation- 1 - a swarm of winged shapes are moving towards the two starships, and will arrive within d6+1 hours_** ).

Once the drive is repaired, the adventurers can maneuver their starship out of the voidspace ( roll 8+; DM +1 Dex 8+, +1 Navigation-1, +1 Pilot- 1_** ), the aperture to which proceeds to collapse as they do so, and can then attempt to plot a jump ( **_roll 9+; DM +1 Intel 8+, +1 Educ 8+, +1 Computer-1, +1 Navigation- 1, +1 ex-Merchant or ex-Navy or ex-Scout ).

The computer will inform the adventurers that there is insufficient fuel for a full jump, so will suggest a “skip-jump”. A “skip-jump” allows a ship to transit across a small area of space within a single star system but is considered very dangerous as it can result in severe damage to the jump drive and other ship systems, or may even result in a catastrophic misjump. Under normal circumstances no ship computer would suggest such a maneuver, nor would it permit such a jump to be programmed. Given their current circumstances, unfortunately, the “skip-jump” is really the only option available to the adventurers ( ***roll 12+; DM +1 Intel 9+, +1 Educ 9+, +1 Computer-1, +1 Electronics-1, +1 Engineering-1, +1 Navigation-1, +1 Pilot- 1*** ). If the adventurers are successful, they find themselves approximately 1000000km (about 6.5 hours travel at 1G) away from [[Phlume]] but their starship jump drive suffers major damage. If they are unsuccessful, then their starship suffers a major misjump and you can choose where they end up (again, this is outside the scoop of this adventure). 

## TO CLAIM A REWARD

Upon arriving at [[Phlume]], the adventurers will have a number of options available:

- They need to get their ship repaired before they can do make any further trips with it. Repairs to the ship will take time (d6 weeks) and will cost d6 x Cr100000.
- They can report their findings regarding the [[Phlume Triangle]] to the local authorities. This will lead to them becoming local celebrities for d6 weeks, earning them d6 x Cr10000 each from interviews and appearances on local vid-channels.
- They can try to claim the reward from the Baron of Phlume. If the adventurers can corroborate their discovery (recordings from their vacc suits will be enough) then the Baron will release the Cr1000000 reward.
- If they rescued any of the survivors, they can hand them over to the Imperial Navy to allow them to be revived. If they rescued the captain, then the Baron of Phlume will be ecstatic and the adventurers will be declared heroes of [[Phlume]], and will have a powerful patron in the Baron from this point onwards.
- They can complete their original task of delivering cargo to [[Phlume]]. The adventures make d6 x Cr50000 credits from the transaction.

# Referee’s Notes

Initially, this adventure appears to be one where the adventurers need to solve their technical problems, and evolves into the exploration of a derelict, long-lost starship with unexpected passengers onboard.

It may be necessary to remind the adventurers that there is a time limit on the amount of exploration they will be able to complete before the spatial anomaly collapses, taking the _Lariinaan_ with it. They need to focus on recovering the essential items they need to solve the problems that their own starship is experiencing.

The exploration of the _Lariinaan_ should be made as unsettling as possible for the adventurers. The ship is a “ghost ship”. It has almost no power, the lighting is at emergency levels (several areas are lit only by emergency red lighting). There are well-preserved dead bodies of crewmen that will be found all over the ship. Noises will echo around the corridors if hatches are left open.

When the ancient warriors finely become active, and start moving around the _Lariinaan_, give the adventurers advanced warning of their approach. They may hear chittering, the vague sound of wings, or similar audio signals that can be used to increase the concerns of the adventurers. They could also potentially see shadows moving as the warriors approach. If any of the adventurers bought a motion detector, it will react to the movement of the warriors.

Hopefully the adventurers will be able to overcome the ancient warriors, and it may be helpful to ensure that they find out how the original crew managed to force the warriors into suspended animation, as the adventurers may find this is the best solution to dealing with a potentially challenging group of opponents.

Once the adventurers have recovered the equipment they need, have dealt with the warriors, and may have even recovered the surviving members of the _Lariinaan_ crew, then they can return to their own vessel. Under no circumstances should they be allowed to bring back a warrior (alive or dead). The warriors all have “self-immolation” implants that will activate if they are killed, turning their remains to fine ash within minutes. If the warriors are forced into hibernation, then the adventurers will find that the chrysalis that the warrior makes is effectively glued to the deck of the ship, and is made of a material that they cannot cut through in the time that they have before the anomaly collapses. 

The mystery surrounding [[The Phlume Triangle]] , the spatial phenomena, and the disappearance of _the Lariinaan_ is not something that the adventurers will fully solve. They will not learn that the spatial phenomena were dimensional traps created by the Ancient known as Grandfather to help him in his war against his children. 

The Phlume Triangle was an attempt by Grandfather to trap some of his children within pocked universes, and this was his first use of this technology which he eventually used to conceal his own world. The Triangle managed to capture one of Grandfather’s children, along with the numerous Droyne warriors they had created to help them in their fight. Grandfather's offspring was able to force the phenomena to open a gateway which then drew in other ships over the millennia. Unfortunately, before the offspring could use this to escape, they were killed by their own warriors, over which they had lost control. The warriors did not have the intellect to try to escape but instead would board the vessels captured by the anomaly, and slay the crews. The Lariinaan is the first ship where the crew managed to find a way to force the warriors into their hibernation state but not before the majority of the crew had been slain. The few crew members that had survived the encounter then placed themselves in cold sleep, hoping that the ship might be able to escape from the anomaly when it next opened. 

Unfortunately for the adventurers, this is when they entered the picture, and the rest, as they say, is history.
