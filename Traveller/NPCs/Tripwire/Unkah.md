# UNKAH

Unkah is an Aslan scientist who has devoted most of her adult life to researching what little is known about the Ancients and their technology. She is a quiet and contemplative person but once engaged in conversation about the Ancients her demeanour changes and she becomes talkative and often quite excitable.
