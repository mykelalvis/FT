Classic Traveller had a statistic for "social standing".  As it was generally based in an empire with nobility and such, this made sense.

In [[Fated Travels]], [[Social Standing]] is an [[Extras|extra]] with a value and a stress track.

Any [[Social Standing]] outside of the range -1 to +1 requires permission in the form of an appropriate background aspect.

Ranges outside of that offer benefits, but must be settled on during character creation.  See [Imperial Nobility](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Imperial_Nobility) for relevant notes of the type of rank.

The Social Standing Stress Track starts with a 1-point and a 2-point [[#Social Stress]] .  Rank in [[Social Standing]] modifies the number of stress available.  +4 and higher also get a 3-point [[#Social Stress]] box.

## Social Stress

The social stress track _only applies to people within 3 ranks of you_.  Thus, a Duke cannot create social stress to anyone lower than +3 (all those people are "beneath them"), and  class cannot induce social stress to anyone above +2 ("out of reach").  You can inflict stress in either direction (up or down), but like most contests, the outcomes will vary depending on who is doing the contesting.

### Aiding in Social Stress

A person may assist in a [[Contest]] up to 4 ranks away, but any blowback results in social stress to the assistor, as well.  In this manner, a lower social standing person _may_ stress someone quite far out of reach.

## Social Consequences

Everyone starts with 1 mild and one severe social consequence.   However, as the lower class is effectively immune to _social_ stress from the upper, and vice versa, this puts the middle class in the firing range.  They also have the least available stress boxes.

## Social Standing in Play

Social standing _within the Empire_ matters _to the Empire_.  Furthermore, as previously stated, [[#Social Stress]] can only be inflicted by those within reach of you.
