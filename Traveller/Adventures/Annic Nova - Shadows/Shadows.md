# Introduction

This booklet contains two comprehensive adventures for Traveller printed back-to-back. Each adventure is complete and independent. This adventure, titled Shadows, deals with a pyramid structure complex on the surface of a world, which the Travellers will encounter and investigate. It is assumed that this adventure will be administered by a referee who has read through this adventure, and who is familiar with both it and the rules for Traveller. This situation calls for only the basic Requires only Traveller booklets (Books 1, 2, and 3), and no additional Basic Traveller. supplements, books, or other information. As usual, paper, pencils, six-sided dice, and square-grid graph paper will prove necessary during the course of the adventure.

## Standards and Assumptions

The following standards and assumptions are used in the text of this adventure.
The referee may alter them as necessary to correspond to a local situation.

### Dates

All dates herein correspond to the Imperial calendar. The initial date for this situation is 190-1105; 190 is the current day (the 190th day of the year) in the standard 365-day year, while 1105 is the current year in the lmperium. Once the adventure begins, time should flow normally. If necessary, change the date to match a local situation.

### Place

This adventure takes place on [[Yorbund]] (0703 -C7C6503 -7), which is situated in the [[Regina Subsector]] in the [[The Spinward Marches]] of the lmperium.

## Using this Adventure

REFEREE'S CHECKLIST

1. Assign characters.
2. Allow equipment purchase.
3. State situation.
4. Guide characters through situation based on their actions.

The referee can use this adventure as an independent situation with pregenerated characters (as written), or may use it with continuing characters from an existing campaign. Changes necessary for an existing campaign should be both simple and obvious.

Referee's Checklist: The steps shown in the referee's checklist should guide the referee through the elements of administering this adventure. Characters are covered next in this section, as is equipment purchase.

[[#The situation]] is stated herein, with additional materials contained in the remainder of the adventure.

### Characters

This adventure is intended for a band of adventurers numbering at least two and
no more than eight. A group of pre-generated characters is supplied below, although
the referee may allow other individuals instead.

|  #  | Character                 |   UPP  | Age | Terms | Money  |                                  Skills                                 |         Possessions |

A skill level of 0 (for example, vacc-0) has been assigned to show some familiarity with a skill, sufficient to allow use, but no real expertise. A skill level of 0 with a gun (for example, carbine-0) shows the preferred, or best, weapon for an individual otherwise without weapon skill.

EQUIPMENT
Referees using an on-going campaign should ignore the remainder of this section, with the possible exception of the [[#Available Equipment Table]].

> [!info]- SHIP'S LOCKER
>
> - eight vacc suits, each with oxygen  tanks for eight hours and  medium range comrno gear
> - four carbines, each with ten magazines (100 rounds).
> - two automatic pistols, each with ten loaded magazines (150 rounds).
> - four cutlasses, each with a belt scabbard.
> - one long range communicator
>   In addition, the scout/courier has an air/raft on board, and has a single pulse laser installed in its turret.

Characters should review their equipment, and may purchase more. However, it is essential that one of the characters be the retired scout (character number 1 ), because he provides the scout ship which serves as transport for the adventurers. The retired scout has possession of a type S scout/courier. Its ship's locker contains the equipment shown in the table. At the beginning of the adventure, before the characters are told of the details of the adventure, they should be allowed to purchase any other equipment they feel will be necessary or desirable. Any equipment available may be purchased, subject to the following restrictions:

1. It must be mentioned and described in Book 1 or Book 3 of Traveller, or in the available equipment table below.
2. The item must be paid for. Since the only assets available are the balances above, some items (ie, battle dress) are precluded because of expense.

# The Situation

After a call at [[Yorbund#Marion Starport|Marion Starport]] on [[Yorbund]], consisting of a complete refuelling and a visit to the minor attractions of the [[Yorbund#Fungus Caverns|caverns of Yorbund]], the band of adventurers prepared for a routine take-off, bound outsystem for [[Kinorb]]. In the last few seconds before lift-off, however, a seismic tremor shook the field, disrupting the count-down. Although lift-off took place on schedule, the possibility remains that the ship sustained damage from the tremor. The adventurers place it in orbit while routine checks are run on all ship's systems for possible malfunction. After three hours, all readings indicate negative problems.

However, the ship's scanners have detected a surface feature of some interest on Yorbund. Located far into unsettled territory, and not appearing on any maps, the feature appeared in a break in the almost perpetual overcast. An aerial view of the feature is shown to the right. Extensive use of the ship's computer on the image data in memory gradually expands the information available, although additional images are obscured by the overcast and the nature of the atmosphere below. The three pyramid complex appears to be constructed of stone having a high metal content, with a high probability of voids within the structure, although none of high volume. The feature appears to be old, constructed (rather than natural), and not of human origin. It appears safe for an exploratory expedition.

The landing at Marion Starport provided some basic background to the travellers which it would be well to remember.

1. The local atmosphere is insidious, corrosive, and will defeat all personal protective measures within eight hours. The adventurers did not go outside at the starport, accessing facilities through tunnels and portals. Their vacc suits remain in prime condition. Once the suits are exposed to the local atmosphere, they will need reconditioning, at high cost in money (Cr200 each) and time (at least a week).
2. Yorbund is largely unexplored, with few individuals venturing far from the starport and associated caverns. Cloaked in a dense overcast atmosphere, little is known of the surface features of the world. As experience has shown, Yorbund is subject to seismic tremors, generally of low magnitude, but sometimes quite severe; such tremors have detected from nearly all points on the world's surface. Finally, the planet is known to be subject to considerable volcanism.
3. The ship is fuelled, and can maneuver for some time, even land several times if necessary, and still jump outsystem. In all probability, questions would be asked at the starport if the ship returned there, and Marion Starport is the only source of fuel insystem.

Deciding to investigate the feature, the ship descends to the world surface, and follows a flight path to land within a kilometer of the complex. In the last few seconds of the approach, an energy blast passes within meters of the ship, almost disabling it. Instrumentation shows that the beam came from the pyramids. Computer readouts indicate that the ship will probably (80% chance) be shot down if it attempts to take off without that beam being disabled.

# Inside the Pyramids

The pyramid complex is obviously an artifact constructed by some race (human or other), by all appearances at some date in the far past. The adventurers are forced to investigate it in detail.

![[Shadows-1.jpg|200]]
[[Shadows-1.jpg|Map 2]]

## Entry Points

The computer view of the complex indicates no obvious points of entry into the pyramids; it does show several possibles, each of which may be investigated. Each entry below describes the location, indicates throws to use while investigating, and then details the results to be implemented by the referee.

1. The empty shaft on the platform appears to have vents or drainage pipes at its base. The vents are obvious to the observer. The shaft has a depth of nearly 10 meters. The twin openings at the bottom of the shaft will accept a crawling person after the protective metal bars are cut away (with cutting equipment or energy weapon: ten minutes, another ten minutes to remove the stubs in order to avoid cutting into the vacc suit when crawling through). Entrance proceeds to [[#^location-32|location 32]] on the Power Plant Level on page 12.

2. One or more of the statuary figures on the platform (or atop the pyramid) may be movable to reveal an entry. Fifteen minutes of close checking will show that none of the figures in the parallel rows on the platform are movable; throw 9+ for any one character to deduce that some of the broken figures show solid construction, and are not movable. This saves the 15 minutes. The single figure atop the pyramid is constructed so as to pivot (throw 9+ per five minutes, DM +3 if intel B+, to so note). Total strength required to move it: strength characteristics totalling 13. It reveals a vertical shaft of great depth. A dim light glows within. The shaft is shown entering the top of the diagram to the left. Descending this shaft will require cable, and a swinging motion once down. The upper level within is [[#^location-1|location 1]]on the Interior Level. The lower level within is [[#^location-15|location 15]]on the Deep Level.

3. Either of the stairways may have some indication of a concealed doorway. Regardless of how long these areas are checked, they will reveal nothing; but no definite proof will surface that there is no entry present. The referee should roll (secretly, and disregarding the outcome) for each five minutes spent checking. A doorway may be discovered in the long stairway from the inside (at [[#^location-1|location 1]]) and forced open (from inside, by a combined strength characteristic of 13+).

4. As in [[Terra|Terran]] pyramids, a shaft entrance may be concealed on the face of one or more of the pyramids, probably in shadow. Such a search will prove fruitless.

5. Finally, the flat upper surface of the small pyramid may have some sort of entry. It does not, although the surface does have a temperature substantially higher than the environment (about 100 degrees C, the boiling point of water).

Finally, the idea of brute force may well occur to the adventurers. Personal weapons will have virtually no effect on the surfaces of the complex, although a blast from an energy weapon at the long stairway on the pyramid will reveal the doorway there. If the scout ship's laser is used, it will cut a 1.5 meter hole for each hit (assumed good accuracy at this range), but will also provoke an energy blast from the nearest face of the large pyramid. Such fire will be on a one-for-one basis; throw 8+ for the shot to hit the scout ship. The first hit will hole the hull (referee determines what portion of the ship is hit, and results; take into account self-sealing hull, hatches and interior compartmentation, and corrosion effects of the atmosphere), the second will disable the maneuver drives, and the third will disable the laser. The laser fire will not affect return fire from the pyramid.

## Interior Features

The interior of the complex should come as a distinct surprise to its violators. While the outside of the structure is angular and regular, the interior is curved and rounded.

Large Chambers: [[#^Diagram-2|Diagram 2]] shows a typical large chamber (such as [[#^location-11|location 11]]) with a curved ceiling and side access to a corridor. Note the sunken central floor area, drainage, and ceiling vent. The curved line at the top is a lighting fixture which produces a dull glow sufficient for most vision requirements. [[#^location-1|Location 1]] and [[#^location-09|Location 9]] are similar in shape and layout, although they both have deep central shafts.

[[Shadows-4.jpg|Link to]] Diagram 4 ^Diagram-4

![[Shadows-5.jpg|200]]
[[Shadows-5.jpg|Link to ]] Diagram 5 ^Diagram-5

Corridors: Connecting the interior chambers are round corridors as shown in Diagram 5. The upper (larger) corridor is typical of those connecting major areas, while the smaller corridor is typical of those connecting side chambers, or leading to the Power Plant Level (from [[#^location-13|location 13]]). These corridors have a ceiling plate which provides light, and a flat platform at the bottom which provides a pathway for individuals.

This platform appears to be made of iron sheets and is suspended without visible means of support several centimeters above the bottom of the corridor; obviously magnetism is at work. Individuals stepping onto the platform will cause it is settle slightly, but never enough to touch the corridor wall. Liquified vapor settles to the bottom of the corridors, and accumulates below the platforms. Above the corridors, a vent is concealed in the body of the pyramid; below the corridors, a drain pipe is similarly concealed. These connections are visible in large chambers, or at the fracture in the large corridor on the Interior Level.

Small Chamber: Diagram 6 on this page shows a cross section of a large corridor and two small adjoining chambers, an arrangement typical of the small chambers. Locations [[#^location-4|4]], [[#^location-6|6]], [[#^location-8|8]], and [[#^location-20|20]] have lower-level platform floors within; locations [[#^location-2|2]], [[#^location-3|3]], [[#^location-5|5]], [[#^location-7|7]], and [[#^location-19|19]] have higher-level platforms.

SMALL CHAMBERS
![[Shadows-6.jpg|200]]
[[Shadows-6.jpg|Link to]]Diagram 6 ^Diagram-6

Note the large curved doors, suspended on magnetic fields. For each, throw 9+ for the door to be in the open position. Closed doors may be opened by brute strength, applying 13+ in strength characteristic, and then propping the door open with a bar, tool, or weapon. Open doors will prove very difficult to close. In the event of a seismic tremor, any doors may change position on 7+ unless already propped open.

Note the magnetic platform floors. Such floors are similar to the platforms in the corridors, but span the full width of the small chambers, leaving a very small gap (only a few centimeters) at the edges. In rooms with high level floors, virtually the only way to gain access to beneath the floor requires several persons (at least two) at one side, tilting the platform near the entrance corridor; the gap which results will allow a person to slip into the chamber below. If done improperly, the explorer can get trapped (throw 8+ to get trapped; DM +1 for each person counter- weighting the platform in excess of 2). If trapped, throw 7+ for the vacc suit to be torn while being retrieved; DM + vacc suit skill.

Environment: The interior of the pyramid complex is interesting in its atmosphere, lighting, and temperature.

Atmosphere: In gaseous content, the interior atmosphere is similar to that on the world surface. However, vents and passages constantly keep the atmosphere in circulation. In most cases, the atmosphere is transparent, but close to floors, in depressions, and under the metal corridor platforms, it has condensed to a pinkish vapor, opague to visible and infrared light. This vapor .can also be seen wafting down from ceiling vents, and accumulating to a depth of about ten centimeters. When (and if) analyzed, the atmosphere tester light glows red. The vapor will show a high percentage of halogens in addition to the expected gases.

Lighting.: All interior rooms and corridors are lighted with a dull glow from ceiling panels. Close examination will show (to one with electronic skill) that these panels use a form of electroluminescence, drawing electric current (in low wattage) from connections directly in the body of the pyramids. Shooting or breaking a specific panel (they run about 6 meters long) will not extinguish it unless the entire panel is broken. Two areas (locations [[#^location-20|20]] and [[#^location-23|23]]) on the [[#Deep Level Locations (14-24)|Deep Level]] are in darkness, and close examination will show that the light panels in these areas have been deliberately broken to put them out.

Temperature: Temperature is remarkably constant within the complex, staying at a steady 20 degrees C at chest height. However, this temperature varies with height within the chambers. Near the ceiling, it rises to 25 or even 30 degrees; near the floor, it reaches 10 degrees. This differential contributes to the maintenance of the vapor near the floor. An individual with electronic skill will deduce that this effect is produced by solid-state electromagnetic effects.

### The Faults

Two locations show evidence within the interior of the pyramid complex.

![[Shadows-7.jpg|200]]
[[Shadows-7.jpg|Link to ]] Diagram 7 ^Diagram-7

One, in a horizontal corridor on the Interior Level, and shown in section above, has occurred where the corridor tubes have changed orientation slightly. Someone with navigation skill may notice (throw 9+; DM +2 if intel 8+) that the fault corresponds to the juncture between the two adjacent pyramids. The meaning of this fact is not obvious. Visible at the horizontal fault are the upper vent and lower drain pipe, with opaque vapor drifting down from above. A second fault (at [[#^location-14|location 14]]) is located in the vertical shaft leading down from [[#^location-1|location 1]]to [[#^location-15|location 15]]. This fault is not as obvious as the horizontal fault; and will probably not be discovered unless inspected as adventurers move down the shaft. Note that a similar shaft connects locations [[#^location-09|9]] and [[#^location-21|21]], but does not have a fault in its length.

## The Individual Locations

Locations on the diagrams range from [[#^location-1|1]] through [[#^location-32|32]], each of which denotes an area of potential interest. By investigation of these areas, the adventurers may well discover what should have become by now their _de facto_ goal: to find the controls for the self-defense beam for the complex, and disable. it to allow their ship to leave again-all within the eight hour imposed by local atmosphere effects on their vacc suits.

Although the band may feel that splitting up will provide the greatest chance at results, this should not be allowed, regardless of its size. There is safety in numbers, and the band should be so informed; in addition, single groups are more efficiently handled by the referee. Should they insist on splitting up, each band should receive a negative DM of at least -3 on all throws until the bands reunite.

It should be assumed that movement takes little time, but that careful search can be very time consuming. As a result, apply the following time spans:

A. _To move from one location to an adjacent location (except changing levels)_ - two or three minutes.
B. _To casually look into a location_ - two or three minutes.
C. _To carefully search a room, sufficient to attempt the throw for success in the search_ - ten minutes.

Other times are given with specific areas or locations, as necessary.

### Interior Level Locations (1-13)

The following locations are situated in Diagram 3.

1. Large Chamber. This chamber, on the Interior Level, is the area entered from  the shaft leading down from the statue atop the pyramid. Its center is also a shaft leading down some 95 meters to the Deep Level. Essentially a simple walkway surrounding the shaft, this chamber is bare of any features, and does not even include fixtures on which to fasten cable or rope. ^location-1
2. Small Chamber. Throw 9+ for the door to be open. This chamber with a high level floor, is reached by climbing up a set of raised stair rungs and passing through a doorway onto the metal floor. The upper area is empty, except for some dirt and debris. For careful search, throw 5+: if successful, it will reveal that the dirt and debris is animal spoor, and that the area under the floor is emitting noises as if there are animals down there. If a character manages to get below the floor, a set of animal lairs will become apparent; consult the encounter tables. ^location-2
3. Small Chamber. Throw 9+ for the door to be open. This chamber has a high level floor, and is reached by climbing up a set of raised stair rungs and passing through a doorway onto a metal floor. The upper area is filled with boxes made of pressed board, all now empty. Careful search (throw 8+; DM +2 if more than 4 persons are searching) reveals that indeed none of the boxes are full; they appear to be natural organic products. Additional search below the floor (requires ten minutes, use procedure on page 10) reveals that the entire lower area is filled with a pool of vapor. ^location-3
4. Small Chamber. Throw 9+ for the door to be open. This chamber has a low level floor, all of which is covered with soil; growing in the soil is a profusion of plants. Careful search (throw 6+; DM +1 for mechanical skill in any degree) requires actually getting down into the soil and moving it with the hands-it will reveal that the area is cultivated rather than wild or natural, although the time between visits for care appear to be on the order of years. The plants are actually fungi, and appear to be nearing a ripe or mature stage. ^location-4
5. Small Chamber. Throw 9+ for the door to be open. This chamber is similar to [[#^location-3|location 3]], and should be administered like it. However, the area under the floor is only half filled with vapor. ^location-5
6. Small Chamber. Throw 9+ for the door to be open. This chamber is similar to [[#^location-4|location 4]], and should be administered like it. If, however, a careful search is performed, those involved will be attacked by crawlers automatically. See [[#Animal Encounters]]. ^location-6
7. Small Chamber. Throw 9+ for the door to be open. This chamber is similar to [[#^location-3|location 3]], and should be administered like it. However, the upper area is empty (obvious to casual search), and the lower area is empty of vapor. Careful search of the lower area (throw 6+; DM +3 for electric torches or cold lights) reveal debris similar to the animal spoor in [[#^location-2|location 2]]. ^location-7
8. Small Chamber. Throw 9+ for the door to be open. This chamber is similar to [[#^location-4|location 4]], but there is virtually no plant life present; what material is present appear to be immature specimens. ^location-8
9. Large Central Chamber. This chamber is similar to [[#^location-1|location 1]], with the following exceptions. First, there is no shaft leading upward. Second, suspended from the ceiling is a thick knobby cable which descends into the depths of the shaft leading down. This cable appears taut, and is moving slightly, as if connected to a pendulum. A casual search will reveal nothing else. A careful search (throw 9+; DM - number of persons searching) will reveal two things. First, that there is a small kicker at the pendulum connection; it occasionally supplies force to keep the pendulum swinging. Second, a concealed passage ([[#^location-13|location 13]]) becomes obvious. ^location-09

   An individual with navigation skill will note that the center of this chamber is at the exact center of the large pyramid. The knobby cable may be a method of descending into the depths of the shaft. It would require a leap to the cable (throw dexterity or less to succeed; DM+ vacc suit skill, DOM -3 if vacc suit skill is 0 or non-existent); followed by a slow descent (throw strength or less to succeed; DM + vacc suit skill and + endurance, DM -4 if vacc suit skill is zero or non-existent). Perform the descent throw three times (for high, moderate, and low heights). If any throw is unsuccessful, the individual falls, and will suffer: 20 hits applied randomly in one lump (perhaps producing unconsciousness), and a further 20 applied in 10 units. In addition, vacc suit integrity may be broken (throw 10+; OM+ vacc suit skill), which will result in instant death.
   Ascending the cable follows a reverse procedure, but requires an automatic DM -2 on each throw to cover the added strain of moving up the cable, and then leaping from an unstable position.
   Referee's Note.: At this point, the band may decide to split up rather than risk all their lives in a descent. The portion which remains behind should stay in chamber 9 in order to avoid the divided band penalties for both groups (as specified on page 12).
10. Large Chamber. Large chambers have no doors. This large chamber is empty, and has a cross-section as shown in [[#^Diagram-8|Diagram 8]]. The central sunken area is filled with vapor. Casual search will reveal nothing; careful search (throw 10+ for success; OM +8 if anyone has infrared goggles) will show that the walls of the chamber are painted in a striking mural visible only in infrared. It is possible to detect the mural (but not view its content) on close inspection in visible light. The mural shows a perception of the area around the pyramid complex, with a low range of mountains in the background. Most apparent, however, is the vast throng of reptilian creatures (about human size) crowding around the complex. They appear intelligent and civilized, perhaps congregated for a religious or political purpose. Specific details of these beings are not especially obvious to the observer. ^location-10
11. Large Chamber. Large chambers have no doors. This chamber is similar to [[#^location-10|location 10]], and should be administered like it. However, the mural in this chamber is a depiction of several reptilian creatures engaged in throwing snake-like small animals into the open shaft on the platform outside the complex. Careful search (throw 9+; OM +3 if more than two persons are involved) will show that the fluid in the central depression in the chamber is populated with snakes like those shown on the mural. An individual approaching adjacent to the lip of the depression may provoke the snakes (die roll 2, page 18) to attack, even if they have not yet been discovered by search. The fluid in the depression will vaporize if subjected to great heat; specifically, if an energy weapon is fired at the pool, its contents will vaporize after three shots. It will immediately begin refilling from the drain pipe, but several skeletons (of crawlers, flyers, and the humanoid reptilians) will be visible at the bottom. ^location-11
12. Large Chamber. Large chambers have no doors. This chamber is similar to [[#^location-10|location 10]], and should be administered like it. However, the mural in this chamber shows a large flock of flying creatures (recognizable as flyers, page 18-19) soaring and diving around the complex. Flashes of energy are shooting from the faces of the large pyramid, incinerating individual flyers. No other animals or beings are visible in the representation. Careful search (throw 9+; DM +3 if mechanical skill is present) will show that the represented energy blasts can hit any location within sight of the pyramid, but cannot hit locations which are occluded by the smaller pyramids. By deduction, it would appear possible for the ship to take off without danger from the energy beam, if it first moves until occluded by one of the smaller pyramids, and then lifts off so as to remain shadowed by that smaller pyramid. ^location-12
13. Concealed Passage. This doorway is revealed only by careful search of chamber 9. The panel concealing the doorway will open to combined strength characteristics of 13+. When opened, there is a chance (throw 7+) that a flock of flyers (die roll 7, page 18) are concealed behind it, and will erupt in an. attack. Each individual in [[#^location-09|location 9]]would be forced to fight (three combat rounds) before retreating to the safety of another chamber or passage. Any adjacent to the central shaft in [[#^location-09|location 9]]should throw once (throw twice dexterity, or less) to avoid falling into the shaft. If a fall does occur, throw dexterity or less to grab hold of the pendulum cable. See [[#^location-09|location 9]]for falling resolution. The passage from 13 leads on a slant down to the [[#Power Plant Level Locations (25-32)|Power Plant Level]]. ^location-13

### Deep Level Locations (14-24)

The following locations are situated on Diagram 4 (14 is on Diagram 1 ).

14. Fracture Point in the shaft connection [[#^location-1|Location 1]] and [[#^location-15|Location 15]]. This lip on the shaft is a result of seismic activity. An individual stopping here will find several small snake skeletons. Throw twice dexterity or less to avoid slipping and falling; DM + vacc suit skill. Careful search (throw 10+) will show a single gold coin engraved with a symbol of a flame. ^location-14
15. Large Central Chamber. The floor of the chamber is flat, with no central depression. It is littered with snake skeletons. Large quantities of vapor are wafting from [[#^location-17|location 17]], and cascades of vapor are drifting down from above. Careful search (throw 10+; DM + medical skill) will show that many of the skeletons are reasonably recent, but that the carcasses decay or degrade rapidly in the corrosive atmosphere. In addition, the skeletons are concentrated toward locations [[#^location-16|16]] and [[#^location-18|18]]; very few are near [[#^location-17|17]]. ^location-15
16. Small Chamber. Throw 9+ for the door to be open. This chamber is identical to [[#^location-2|location 2]], and should be administered like it. ^location-16
17. Large Chamber. Large chambers have no doors. The entrance way to this chamber is highly charged; any individual moving through it and touching any surface will set off an electric charge which will inflict 40 hits on him or her. This effect can be avoided by leaping the distance (3 meters), or by crawling through the vent pipe overhead. The interior of this chamber is quite cold; much of the interior is. filled with vapor, obscuring vision. The central depression is filled with frozen gas, and forms a hard surface. However, more than three persons on the surface will cause it to break, dropping all into the cold fluid beneath. Throw dexterity or less to escape if the surface break; throw dexterity (DM - Vacc suit skill) or less to avoid 1D hits from the fall.  Careful search of this chamber should be promoted by the fact that the walls have a mural (in visible light) of the exterior landscape of the complex. However, even careful search will reveal nothing else. ^location-17
18. Large Chamber. Large chambers have no doors. This chamber is completely empty, even to the point of the central depression being empty and dry, and the walls being completely featureless. Careful search will reveal nothing. ^location-18
19. Small Chamber. Throw 9+ for the door to be open. This small chamber is empty. Careful search will reveal nothing. ^location-19
20. Small Chamber. Throw 9+ for the door to be open. This chamber is unusual in that it is accessed by a long dark small corridor. The chamber itself has a caved in ceiling; shards of ceiling material have drooped down, and soil or stone has formed a pile on the floor. Careful search (throw 10+; DM +1 for each electric torch or cold light involved) will reveal the skeleton of a reptilian alien, with only rags left from his clothes, and a small fiber pouch in the heap of soil; its contents include a set of 37 gold coins (a 38th coin is at [[#^location-14|location 14]]), and a knife of obviously alien manufacture. Any individual with education 9+ will see that the ceiling will probably cave in completely with the next seismic tremor. Throw 6+ on each succeeding tremor until it does cave in. ^location-20
21. Large Central Chamber. Suspended in the center of this chamber is a large (one meter diameter) pendulum weight at the end of a knobby cable. Inscribed on the floor of the chamber is a complicated pattern which the pendulum weight follows. Careful search (throw 7+; DM +electronic skill) will show that the pattern is inscribed on movable panels which can be displaced. Beneath the panels are a series of eight pie shaped compartments. Numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7 are empty. Number 3 contains a set of twelve grippies-small clamp-tools of strange form and design. Intelligence of B+ will see that they can be used to create foot and hand holds on the knobby cable; climbing up with them will avoid the negative DMs on the throws given in [[#^location-09|location 9]].. Number 6 is connected to the drain pipes, and contains a flock of crawlers which will attack when exposed. Number 8 contains a flat metal fragment; intelligence of 9+ will deduce that it is a key which will open or close any doors to chambers. ^location-21
22. Large Chamber. Large chambers have no doors. This chamber is obviously a control room when the adventurers enter it. The walls of the chamber are covered with a large array of bar dials-each begins at floor level, and ascends to the center of the ceiling. Changes in color along the length indicate intensity or value. Careful search (throw 9+; DM +1 per person with education above 9) will show that the instruments and controls are divided into three basic groups which can be numbered from 1 to 100 (arbitrarily, and for convenience). ^location-22

    - Group One (numbered 1 to 33) consists of instruments with fluctuating readings-probably power plant related.
    - Group Two (numbered 34 to 66) exhibits constant readings, with most showing some low degree of value, and numbers 53 and 56 reading (anomalously) at zero.  Add 33 to the location number to determine which guage/control refers to which lighting fixture. Numbers 65 and 66 refer to corridor lighting.
    - Group Three (numbered 67 to 100) consists of instruments which are reading very low values-except for 99, which reads at a very high intensity. Gauge 99 reflects power consumption for the detectors which govern the energy beam.

    Experimentation may be called for by the adventurers. Below each guage is a set of three depressions. The top one will turn on a device or circuit; the bottom one will turn off a device or circuit. But, as a safety device, neither will work unless a finger is also inserted in the central depression simultaneously. Assume that this trick will not be chanced upon until at least a half hour of careful search has passed (throw 11 +to succeed; DM +1 per ten minutes total time spent searching).
    If all power plant controls are turned to zero, all power (lighting, power plant, defenses) will go to zero, and nothing can be restarted. If control 69 is activated, a subsonic signal will panic all animals within the complex. Control 74 will turn off the pendulum kicker. Control 83 will turn off the defenses of [[#^location-17|location 17]]. Controls 69 and 84 come on automatically two minutes before a seismic tremor occurs.
23. Large Chamber. Large chambers do not have doors. This location is quite similar to [[#^location-22|location 22]], but the interior lights do not work, and all of the controls and guages read zero. An atmosphere tester with a serial number in the 4000 range will emit a beep, and the green and amber lights will come on, although the air remains unbreathable in this chamber. ^location-23
24. Large Chamber. Large chambers do not have doors, and this one has no central depression; instead, it has a raised dais of stone rubbed smooth from long use. ^location-24

### Power Plant Level Locations (25-32)

The following locations are situated on Diagram 8.

25. Passage. Entered from [[#^location-13|location 13]], this long sloping passage leads downward toward the interior a small adjacent pyramid. The floor is strewn with animal spoor. ^location-25
26. Power Plant Chamber. Large pieces of machinery occupy most of this chamber. The complexity of this equipment makes it difficult and dangerous to disable this power plant. Should it be attempted, the individual(s) involved in the effort must select a seemingly important looking item, and cut or destroy it. Throw 12+ (DM + electronic or mechanical skill) to succeed. If not successful by the second try (ten minutes per try), the frequency of seismic tremors will increase. ^location-26
27. Fuel Chamber. This large area is filled with vapor to a depth of perhaps a meter. Careful search (throw 9+) will show feed lines leading from the tank to [[#^location-26|location 26]]. Cutting these lines, however, will not affect the power plant. ^location-27
28. Vent Chamber. This unused chamber apparently serves for overflow of power plant exhausts, although this is not currently happening. An individual with intelligence B+ will see that this chamber is required only if the power plant is in overload status. ^location-28
29. Surge Chamber. This small chamber is empty, and apparently part of the power plant vent system. ^location-29
30. Surge Chamber. This small chamber is similar to [[#^location-29|location 29]]. ^location-30
31. Surge Chamber. This small chamber is similar to [[#^location-29|location 29]]. ^location-31
32. Access Points. Two barred entry points are situated at the bottom of the the shaft on the platform outside the complex. ^location-32

# Encounters

## Animal Encounters

The interior of the pyramid complex is infested with a large number of animals, all of which have lived and bred within its walls for hundreds of years. They inhabit the airshafts, the drainage vents, the small spaces beneath the magnetic flooring, and other likely areas such as the pools in large chambers. Three basic types of animals are present: flying hunters, chasers, and amphibian grazers. All are rather small (none larger than 12 kilograms) and not especially smart. However, all run in packs, and their numbers can endanger adventurers if they do attack. All three types are described in detail [[#The Animals|here]].

Each time the adventuring band enters a new area, the referee should throw randomly to determine if they have encountered a group of animals. Thus, there is a continuing chance that the characters will come upon animals which will obstruct them in their searches. Throw 8+ (two dice) for an animal encounter to occur. DM +2 if interior lights for the pyramid are out locally when the throw is made. Make the throw whenever the band moves from one location to another, including when moving just into a corridor. If a band is split, throw separately for each portion whenever one of them should be rolled for. If an encounter occurs, consult the animal encounter table below.

### Surprise

Assume the adventurers have surprise (they surely will be alert to begin with) for the first encounter on this table. Thereafter, roll for surprise using the instructions from page 26 of Book 1. Assume that animals with surprise will attack. Priority: Specific animal encounters are stated in locations [[#^location-11|11]] and [[#^location-13|13]]. They override the use of the animal encounter table.

### The Animals

![[Shadows-animals.jpg]]
[[Shadows-animals.jpg|Shadows Animals]]

The three animal types encountered appear to be distinct (though related) species; upon examination of specimens (a character must examine at least one specimen of each type during the adventure, and throw education minus 5 or less, at the end of the adventure) they are discovered to be developmental stages in the life of a single animal. The amphibian grazer form hatches from eggs laid in the pools of fluid. The juveniles spend most of their time swimming, but venture out at intervals to feed upon the plant and fungal material growing in the small chambers.

After an unknown period of growth (from the 3cm hatching length to the full size of 75 to 100 cm) the juvenile locates a protected place in which to enter a period of suspended animation, during which it metamorphosizes into one of the two adult forms, either the four-legged male or larger winged female. At irregular intervals throughout the year, the two sexes return to the pools from which they hatched, where they produce large quantities of eggs. The adults are carnivorous, and feed on the juvenile form.

The juvenile form reaches a maximum length of from 75 to 100 cm, and a maximum of 1 to 3 kg before maturing. The young are covered with a thick scaly skin which serves to protect them from the ravages of the insidious atmosphere. The juvenile, unlike the adult life forms, is toothless, but is equipped with a number of serrated structures along the edges of the mouth to aid in biting off sections of the fibrous plant material upon which the juveniles feed.

The male reaches a maximum size of about 40 cm, weighing from 3 to 6 kg. Like the juveniles, the males are covered with scales, but in mature forms, these are finer and covered with a thin, tough outer layer of skin.

Females are usually about 60 cm in length, with a wingspan of 100 to 120 cm. They typically weigh from 6 to 12 kg. The wings are formed from the· thin outer skin stretched over a framework of thin bones, in a manner similar to the [[Terra|Terran]] bat or the macropan screamer-in-the-darkness. This form, like the male, feeds on the juvenile, making this organism the only known case of an animal feeding solely off its own young.

## Seismic Tremors

> The entire complex begins to shake and vibrate. Any open door will change its condition on a throw of 7+.

Throw two dice for the strength of a tremor: any individual with a dexterity less than the throw is shaken to the floor or ground by the force of the quake. Throw endurance or less to avoid 1D bruises from the fall; DM minus vacc suit skill and brawling skill. Throw 11+ to lose vacc suit integrity; DM minus vacc suit skill.

### Frequency

Quakes occur on the encounter table. Before such a quake occurs, the predictors ([[#^location-21|location 21]]) will activate. Tampering with the power plant ([[#^location-26|location 26]]) will increase the frequency of the tremors to one per ten minutes, with each becoming stronger (DM +1 to the throw for each new quake strength).

# Referee's Notes

The pyramid structure on Yorbund was constructed perhaps 50,000 years ago by a minor alien race originating far to coreward. Voluntary exiles from their own civilization, they selected this world as the site of their noble experiment in esthetic simplistics. The group seeded this region of Yorbund with food animals and settled into a simple life of contemplation in natural surroundings. The only reminder of their origins is the pyramid structure, created as a central esthetic rallying point (the aliens congregated here at regular intervals for group interaction).

## Alien Creatures

The aliens themselves are vaguely reptilian, derived from quadripedal carnivore stock; now upright, they utilize their thick tails for balance, incidentally freeing a three-fingered hand with twin opposable thumbs for grasping. The atmosphere in which these creatures exist has greatly influenced their lives and customs. Living things constantly struggle against its corrosive effects; on dying, an animal dissolves in greasy smoke in a matter of minutes. Consequently, food must be eaten live, and meals have never become a social function.

To provide food, a series of breeding chambers (locations [[#^location-2|2]], [[#^location-4|4]], [[#^location-6|6]], and [[#^location-8|8]]) serve to constantly produce small animals which then roam free within the structure. A hungry alien simply grabs one (from under the platform, or from the air) and eats it, selecting the particular taste he prefers by animal type and size. With food animals roaming free, safety devices are installed on all controls which prevent an animal from accidentally triggering them. [[#^location-16|Location 16]] has an electrical barrier which prevents access by non-flying animals. Controls in the control rooms (locations [[#^location-22|22]] and [[#^location-23|23]]) have safeties integral to them.

Social interaction took place (among the pyramid operators) in [[#^location-24|location 24]], as the aliens sunned themselves on the raised stone dais created for that purpose.

## The Energy Beam

The aliens who man (sic) the interior of the pyramid do so to maintain its operation for the others who live a life in the wilds outside. Because the pyramids are an esthetic symbol, one function of its interior controls is to insure that it remains esthetic. The function of the energy beam (shown in the mural at [[#^location-12|location 12]]) is to keep flying creatures away from its surface; their excrement left while they perch on it would detract from its appearance.

Access from the interior level to the deep level by the aliens was by an elevator platform which travelled within the vertical shaft from 1 to 15. The fracture at 14 however, has made that elevator inoperable. Safety interlocks have since made the elevator almost indetectable, and adventurers will probably not discover it.

## Seismic Activity

The aliens have a great deal of interest in seismic activity; which is relatively frequent here. Predictors are installed in the control rooms (locations [[#^location-22|22]] and [[#^location-23|23]]). The pendulum in [[#^location-21|21]] is responsive to such activity. This colony failed many years ago. The food animals seeded outside dispersed, and the area proved unable to support the numbers of aliens present. All that remains today is the pyramid complex, and the animals within, supported through the years by the power plant which continues to operate. These animals, originally docile, have regressed from their meek roles to wilder, more aggressive types. As such, they now pose some danger to the adventurers.
