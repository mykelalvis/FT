# Distances in Space

Concepts like meters and even kilometers are inadequate in the face of the vast distances in space. Over relatively short distances such as in orbital space near a planet thousands or millions of kilometers are used as a measure. Larger distances in–system are measured using the Astronomical Unit, or AU. This is based on the distance of Earth's orbit from the Sun, and is about 160,000,000km.

The light–second is sometimes also used, defined as the distance light travels in a vacuum in one second. This is 299,792,458m, usually rounded to 300,000,000m. One AU is 499 light–seconds.

Over greater distances still larger measures are needed. The light– year (defined as distance light travels in one standard Earth year) is sometimes used. It equates to 63,241 AU. More commonly the Parsec (3.26 Light–years) is used as this is the maximum distance that can be covered in a single Jump by a Jump–1 capable starship.

Most Traveller starmaps use a system of 1 parsec to 1 hex.

> Some Imperial citizens also use the term Coreward to mean towards the Imperial heartworlds, the 'Imperial Core'. This usage is generally obvious from context. For example, it should be fairly obvious that a magazine called Coreward Gazette deals with matters in the Imperial central region and not the center of the galaxy several thousand light–years away.
