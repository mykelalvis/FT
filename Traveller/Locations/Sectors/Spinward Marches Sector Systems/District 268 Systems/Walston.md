Walston (C544338-8) lies in [[District 268]] on the most commonly used route through the [[Bowman Arm]] of the [[Spinward Main]] and possesses one of the best ports (Class C) in the immediate area. This, and the reasonably habitable nature of the world, makes it a popular stopover. Under the right circumstances, Walston might become the economic centre of the arm if and when the subsector joins the Imperium. At present, however, it is a backwater of little importance.

Walston orbits an M2 primary called Albin's Star, named for the captain of the first Imperial exploration ship into the system. The system contains two small gas giants named Insive and Greenish (the latter for its colour) plus five rocky bodies in standard orbits. There are no planetoid belts but the system does have comets and planetoid collections at the [[Trojan points]] of the gas giants. Walston itself lies on the outer fringe of the habitable zone, occupying the innermost orbit of Albin's Star.

Lying in the closest orbit to the system's primary, Walston is the only inhabited body in the system.

Walston is not the most inviting of worlds. It is rather dry, with highly variable temperatures thanks to the thin atmosphere, which requires a filter mask to breathe safely due to the presence of atmospheric taints. Lying on the outer edge of the habitable zone, Walston does not get excessively warm, even during the day, and at night temperatures plummet well below freezing in all regions. Most planets that orbit red dwarf stars in the habitable zone are tidally locked; this is not the case with Walston, which has regular day-night cycles.

Somewhat less than half the planetary surface is under water, not all of which is in liquid form. In the polar regions the seas are constantly frozen to a considerable depth and icebergs are common even close to the equator.

Nightly freezing of freshwater bodies and the surface of some seas is a fact of life. Rainfall tends to be minimal since there is little evaporation of frozen water. Walston has no satellites, so there are no tides to contend with. There is little erosion on land, due to a combination of thin atmosphere and relative dryness. Walston has a number of impressive mountain ranges which create wind shadows and further deprive inland regions of rainfall. The landscape tends towards being rugged and impressive but inhospitable. Rocky badlands and dusty plains are common, although most coastal regions are better watered.

A number of major deep sea thermal vents exist, giving rise to warm currents that make some areas much more habitable than others. Indeed, there are several obvious sites for settlement, although at present only one centre of population, which is on [[#Settlement Island]], off the eastern coast of the world's largest continent, Walston-Main.

## Settlement Island

Settlement Island is fairly large; some 200 kilometres from north to south and 350 kilometres from east to west. The sea between it and [[#Walston-Main]] is shallow and dotted with small islands. A drop in sea level of just a few metres might create a land bridge, although this is not likely to happen. The island itself is not particularly high above sea level except in the southern extreme where a huge extinct volcano ([[#Mount Salbarii]]) and its surrounding hills rise steeply from the coastal plain. The island is washed by a warm current which creates a zone of higher-than-average rainfall and fertile seas; Mount Salbarii traps some of the rain over the island, feeding two great lakes which spill over into northward-flowing rivers. These rivers not only make the island's interior the most habitable part of the planet but also serve as highways between the main and northern settlements.

### Walston-Main
Walston-Main is large, cold and uninviting. Mountain ranges (with the odd active volcano) are interspersed with dusty plains. A number of deep canyons run roughly east-northeast across the continent, although have never been explored. Erosion seems an unlikely explanation for their presence; tectonic activity or some ancient cataclysm may be the cause.

Walston-Main contains about 50 percent of the world's land mass. Most of the rest is split between the Main-Southeast Subcontinent, Walston-Antipodes, the Shallows and Varken's Continent.

### Main-Southeast
Main-Southeast is connected to Walston-Main by two narrow isthmuses. One is more or less impassable, consisting of a chain of volcanic mountains, the other is a frozen desert. Main-Southeast is effectively a separate land mass.

### Walston-Antipodes

Walston-Antipodes lies mostly in the southern hemisphere and includes a great ice shelf. It is not known how much land lies under the ice cap.

### The Shallows

The Shallows is a vast region of very shallow sea with many islands and mountain-tops protruding above the surface. The region would be extremely hazardous to seagoing navigation if any were undertaken. Much of the Shallows is a vast saltwater swamp rather than an archipelago, land mass or sea area. In some areas it is possible to walk for hundreds of kilometres between islands, never encountering water deeper than a person's waist.

### Varken's Continent

Varken's Continent is a horrible place for habitation, with some of the worst terrain on the planet. Some areas may be marginally habitable but are surrounded by mountains and rocky deserts that effectively turn them into islands surrounded by an ocean of desolation, reachable only by air.

### Other
Countless small islands dot the surface of Walston's oceans. Most of these are covered in ice and few offer any reasonable prospects for habitation.

# SOCIO-POLITICAL DATA

Walston is home to about 3,000 individuals, approximately 90 percent of whom are Vargr who are considered second-class citizens. The ruling elite of the world (a hereditary dictatorship) are humans claiming ancestry all the way back to the early settlement of the region during the Rule of Man. This claim is disputable but certainly the ruling families have held Walston for many centuries.

The only inhabited region of the planet is Settlement Island, which has three major 'towns' of about 600 people each and a scattering of small hamlets in addition to the capital at Central Lake. Central, as this settlement is called, is home to about 300 or so inhabitants, most of whom work with the government in some way. Expeditions occasionally visit Walston-Main for various reasons, prospecting being the most common, but until now there have been no attempts to create a permanent base on the mainland.

Law Level is moderately high but not excessive. It is true that Vargr are subject to more laws and regulations than their human neighbours, a fact that has caused concern among Imperial observers given the world's client-state status. An [[Scout Service|IISS]] mission in [[IY1101]] concluded that while Vargr are subject to racist restrictions they are 'not unduly oppressed' and their status does not contravene any Imperial High Laws.

As an Imperial client state, Walston receives protection from the [[Imperial Navy]]; this is more notional than real, given the lack of naval forces in the subsector. A small subsidy is paid to the world government to maintain a Class C starport, located at Walston Startown rather than the capital.

The planetary ruler (Dictator Masterton) is involved in negotiations with Imperial corporations, with a view to license mining and other economic installations in remote areas of the planet. There is absolutely no way for the people of Walston to exploit these resources, or stop any group that felt like moving in, but Masterton still insists upon extortionate licensing fees, stalling the whole process to no one's advantage. Meanwhile, offworld surveyors have begun to do their work. Perhaps the dictator wishes to hold out for a good deal when the surveyors find something that simply must be exploited. However, he runs the risk that a corporation may lose patience and simply move in without permission. With no ability to dislodge an operation by force and too little money to make a challenge in the Imperial courts, there is a real risk that Masterton will provoke a fait accompli that cuts the population out of any benefits of offworld investment.

The Vargr of Walston are accepting of their status. They get little say in government, and cannot hold certain posts, but on the whole are left alone to live their lives as they will, other than paying lip service to the idea that humans are their social superiors. Since most people of Walston live comfortable, unambitious lives and get along well enough, the poor treatment of the Vargr has so far failed to cause social upheaval. Were the population higher with the same proportion of Vargr to humans, an uprising would be more likely to occur but with all of Walston having the population of only a small town on most worlds, this is unlikely to occur. Nevertheless, offworld Vargr tend to become extremely offended at both the human 'overlords' and the contented Vargr 'peons' of Walston.

While Walston has been a client world of the Imperium for many years, there are no plans to apply for full membership. Change is unwelcome and Imperial membership might upset the 'natural order' of things. Certainly the status of Vargr as a lower order would be unacceptable to most Imperial citizens.

# ECONOMIC DATA

Walston has a mainly subsistence economy based on shallow-water seabed farming off the island's ice-free western coast and more conventional agriculture along the river valleys. What manufacturing there is operates as cottage industries in the three main settlements.

A mature TL8 industrial base is quite sufficient to provide a high standard of living and meet the needs of the undersea farming industry. Virtually everything is craftsman-made to order and even utilitarian equipment tends to be of high standard.

The starport employs a few dozen people and brings in a modest income from passing vessels, with crews stopping over. Ships come through regularly – sometimes two or more in a single day – and the part-time port brokerage even turns a profit on speculative cargoes from time-to-time. Walston imports little and exports even less; the port is purely an external commercial installation.

# MILITARY DATA

Walston does not possess a military of any consequence. The dictator maintains a security formation equipped with TL8 small arms and vehicles, which acts as law-enforcement agency, fire and rescue department, and starport security force, in addition to protecting the ruling elite. Other than a couple of support weapons at Central, the security force has nothing more potent than an assault rifle at its disposal.

There is no offworld defence capability whatsoever. Even the starport's single utility boat is unarmed and serves only as transport for maintenance personnel servicing the orbital mooring beacon. Walston does not even possess a ground-to-orbit missile battery.

Similarly, there is no way to project force beyond the coastal waters of Settlement Island and no real force to project. While a militia could be raised and deployed aboard the utility boat or seagoing craft such as coastal faming submarines, it is unlikely that much could be achieved. Walston has no history of conflict and no warrior tradition amongst its people.

# FLORA AND FAUNA

The seas of Walston are home to a variety of hardy life. Most of this is on a microscopic level, although a wide range of fish species, seabed crawlers and free-floating invertebrates exists to feed upon them. Only two species of seagoing animals pose any real threat to humans.

- The first is known as [[Alderson's Hunter]]
- The second is the [[Deep-water Brakarr]]
- [[Walstons]] are bunny-like creatures, often kept as pets.

# LIFE ON WALSTON

Daily life on Walston is slow and, for the most part, comfortable. Filter masks and thick clothing are needed when venturing outside but otherwise there are no serious hazards. Dwellings are kept at an uncomfortably warm temperature (as far as offworld visitors are concerned) by humans; less so by Vargr.

Within the three towns and Central, buildings are blocky with rounded corners and sunk into the ground rather than built upwards. Very few buildings have more than one story above ground but larger ones may have two or even three levels below the entry floor. Within a settlement, structures are grouped close together and connected by semi-sunken tunnels at the entry floor level. Most clusters have only a couple of ground-level entrances for personnel and a common vehicle garage. Outlying hamlets are mostly a single structure, although some have three or more independent buildings if the settlement has expanded.

Indoor clothing on Walston tends to be light. A kilt and light shirt or tunic is the commonest dress for both sexes, with light sandals or bare feet. Vargr tend to wear bright colours, with humans favouring more sober outfits in grey, white, black, blue or dark red. This makes humans look a sombre lot compared with the Vargr but in truth both groups are easy-going and friendly.

Although the Vargr are disenfranchised and must defer to humans in many situations, most refrain from expressing any discontent they might have. There are few decisions to make anyway and everyone has a high standard of living. People of both species tend to be unambitious and find many offworlders to be more than a little bit manic with their go-getter attitudes. Asking most Walston citizens why they do not go offworld to seek their fortune, or set off into the wilderness to find mineral riches, usually results in a blank look and the oft-repeated phrase 'It's nice enough right here!'.

Most of the population work in farms close to the settlements, with smaller numbers employed as divers or submarine crews in the coastal seabed farms. A small percentage work at the starport (usually part time alongside a craftsman or farming job) or are employed in the world's tiny bureaucracy and security force. Vargr work in all industries and can hold high positions, however humans are always given preference.

Vargr are not required to be obsequious to humans; merely to acknowledge that they dwell at a lower level in Walston's social structure. This idea has become ingrained to the point where it is thought of as the natural order of things. The locals are quite comfortable with the idea that offworld Vargr might have different values but here humans are superior. Offworld Vargr tend to find this idea more than a little creepy.

The people of Walston are not good at reacting to problems and are nervous about their responses until they are approved by whoever is perceived as being in charge. A few individuals are quite dynamic, such as the security managers at the underwater farms. These people deal with divers in trouble, and other crises on a regular basis, and are comfortable with thinking on their feet. Most individuals prefer to get together with friends and neighbours and have a good talk about the issue. Hopefully one of the more usual troubleshooters will deal with the problem in the meantime. If confronted with a minor disaster (e.g., a waste-bin fire) the average Walston local will deal with it well enough. However, all the time they will be looking around for someone to defer to and not be comfortable until someone takes charge and approves whatever action was taken.

# Places of Interest

## Startown

![[MA1-380.jpg|200]]
[[MA1-380.jpg|Walston Startown map]]

The startown is only big enough to be a village on most worlds. However, its occupants make decent enough money from passing starships. Some work at the port, others in the hospitality industry. About half of the working population are dependent on offworld Credits for their income.

There are a few decent hotels and a rather more modest hostel offering barracks-like accommodations and basic meals at a very cheap price. In addition, there are a couple of restaurants and a handful of shops selling local and offworld goods. It is possible to walk around the town in a few minutes.

Note that most buildings are underground, with just the top (entry) floor sticking up. Even that is usually half-sunken into the ground and accessed by going down a ramp or steps. Buildings are usually connected in complexes rather than standing alone, with one or two common personnel entrances and an underground vehicle garage serving a number of dwellings plus amenities. The above-ground drabness is alleviated by colourful surroundings and the people inside the buildings.

The locals are friendly and welcoming for the most part and there is little sign of the oppression of the [[Vargr]] population. The social setup on Walston is more subtle than that and it would require an extended stay and close observation to become aware of how it all works.


# Central Lake

![[MA1-384.jpg|200]]
[[MA1-384.jpg|Central Lake Map]]

Reaching Central from the starport is not difficult. There is a regular rail service that runs once per day. The railroad is not in the best of condition as there is insufficient labour available to properly maintain it but so long as the trains do not go very fast it is safe enough.

The trains themselves are short, just a small electric locomotive and a carriage or two at most. There are often a couple of freight cars attached to the back of a train but these are usually empty; they are simply not uncoupled when not needed because that would require someone to do it and already the railroad staff (all 17 of them, serving three main and a few more minor stations, plus the rail depot at the capital) are overworked just running a train every day.

However, despite the somewhat primitive transport, the journey does not take very long and soon Central Station comes into sight. It is located on the edge of the capital, a town that looks remarkably like the one the Travellers just left in many ways, although smaller. There is no starport but there is a large lake with islands to the north. This is Central Lake, named because it lies more or less in the centre of the island.

Central is the rail hub for the island, with a line out to each of the larger towns. The town actually has a reasonable service industry as anyone travelling from one settlement to another by train will almost certainly have to stop over in Central as there is only one train per day to each destination. There are also a couple of government-owned factories and the dictator's palace, which serves as a governmental centre.

The palace is rather grandly named. Like other buildings on [[Walston]] it is largely underground, with just the top floor above the surface. In fact the 'palace' is in four parts. Two are semi-separate accommodation wings for the employees of the government, the security force and the personnel that support them. Between these lies the governmental building where the world's tiny bureaucracy work and accessed through it (there is a private entrance at the other side but guests are not allowed to use it) is the home of the dictator and his immediate family.

The entire 'palace' contains about 75 people all told. About the same number work in the factories and the railroad, all of which are owned by Masterton or his close family. The remainder of the settlement's population either work in service industries or small businesses in town. There are a few farms close to the town as well, plus a small lakeside dock where a handful of fishing boats are moored.

The palace is not really segregated from the rest of the town, except by a wider than usual open space between it and the nearest building complex. There is an obvious entrance facing the town, which is the direction almost anyone coming to the palace will approach from. There are no guards outside and during office hours the outer doors are left open.

The entryway leads to a reception area decorated in the locals' idea of a tasteful and business-like manner. Pastel blue and light to mid-grey seem to be the colours of choice. There is a reception desk where there is a clerk present most of the time. Travellers from a high-population world might be stunned by this. The seat of government for a world does not have a full-time receptionist? Incredible.

In fact, everyone in the world government has more than one job. With just 3,000 people on the entire planet, it is difficult to provide all the trappings of civilisation. Law enforcement, fire and rescue, the railroads, industry and the starport all need personnel, as do the hidden but necessary jobs like sewer maintenance and road mending. As a result, everything has to be done on a shoestring or when someone with three other jobs is available to see to it.

## WALSTON'S SCOUT BASE

The scout base at Walston is an underwhelming affair, composed of a landing platform and a few storage structures that once housed a small team of scientists. Its primary focus was to undertake research into the erosive effects of thin, dry atmospheres and support the occasional scout vessel that came through.

The base is located in a remote area of Settlement Island, high in the mountains, but has been virtually defunct since the [[Fourth Frontier War]]. Scout personnel sometimes appear on Walston and use the base as a stopover. There are no plans to refurbish the facility but should the settlement on Walston grow, there are rumours that the scout base would be revived and expanded.

## MOUNT SALBARII

![[MA1-390.jpg|200]]
[[MA1-390.jpg|Map Around Mt Salbarii]]

![[MA1-387.jpg|200]]
![[MA1-387.jpg|Crater]]

The Travellers have just learned that their ship is parked on top of a mountain and one that might be an active volcano.

The nearest major settlement to Mount Salbarii is, unsurprisingly, named Salbarii. It lies on the western shore of Settlement Island about 20 kilometres north of the volcano, which is a little inland from the coast. The island has a few big hills but Mount Salbarii is by far the highest peak, at about 1,500 metres above sea level. It rises more or less directly from the coastal plain, with only a ridge running southeast by way of foothills. This makes the mountain an imposing sight and fools the eye into thinking that it is a little higher than it actually is.

All the same, 1,500 metres is a considerable climb in an already thin atmosphere and not something that should be attempted on idle whim. There are no mountaineers as such in the town of Salbarii, although a few people have occasionally climbed nearby hills. Some offworlders took it into their collective heads to go up Salbarii a few years back. Apparently they made it and came back okay but did not leave any maps or useful information. In short, while the local shops will be able to sell the Travellers things like rope and backpacks, they are going to have to improvise their way up the mountain.

### CLIMBING THE MOUNTAIN

Getting to the base of Mount Salbarii from the town is not too much of a challenge. The first 500 metres of the ascent can be undertaken aboard a vehicle, albeit not quickly. After that, it is not really feasible to drive a wheeled vehicle any higher. An ATV or an air/raft could do it.

It is possible to climb Mount Salbarii.  As with any expedition, preparation is key. Using respirators or similar breathing-aid apparatuses and cold-weather clothing, the climb will be doable. The early stages are little more than a walk up a steep slope, although there are boulders and outcrops to be detoured around. The thin air will begin to be a problem after a while, even for those acclimatised to some extent.

Climbers will tire and become irritable more quickly than expected. [[#^altsick|altitude sickness]] may worry medically minded Travellers without breathers but it will not be a problem just yet.

It is not possible to just go straight up towards the peak. Instead, climbers must follow a snaking path around boulders and scree slopes, following ridges and working their way higher. On average with detours, steep bits, slow going in places and the odd easy section, a climber  will be able to ascend about 100 metres per hour. They would be well advised to rest or camp overnight on the way up rather than simply charging at the peak in one go, although it is doable for those who like an 'ironman' type challenge.

Up to about 800 metres, there are no significant problems, just a lot of very tiring uphill walking and the odd scramble up a steep or rocky section. After this, climbers start to struggle a bit.

### 800–900 METRES

This segment of the climb is characterised by a lot of steep slopes and tumbled rocks, resulting in many frustrating detours. It takes approximately two hours to ascend 100 metres vertically. Or rather it would but for an obstacle in the form of a volcanic outcrop that runs around much of the mountain. After some investigation, climbers will realise they have a choice of following a long looping ridge around the outcrop or climbing up a 10-metre more or less sheer rock face which, while hazardous, could cut hours off the journey and perhaps avoid other problems further on which are as yet out of sight.

Climbing this segment requires a Routine (6+) END check (two hours), made every 100 metres. Once a rope is established at the top, less skilled climbers should be able to scramble up with a more easily made Easy (4+) DEX check (30 minutes). Failure to make these checks typically indicates that a less-than-optimal path has been chosen or an unexpected impediment appears before the climbers that requires taking an alternative route. Simply retake the check if this is the case. However, if an Effect of -6 or less is rolled and the climber does not have any Athletics skill, they are injured or affected by some combination of the cold, thin atmosphere and the difficulty of the climb. In such case, the climber must rest for D3 hours before continuing.

If the climbers choose not to climb, it will take them 1D hours of frustrating walking to follow the ridge round to a point where they can get past the difficult area.

### 900–1,100 METRES

The going is easier on this section, enabling climbers to make better time. However, this would be a mistake. They are on a thin-atmosphere world to start with and have ascended 1,000 metres from sea level in short time. Ideally, they need to rest and take the climb slowly to avoid altitude sickness.

> [!info] Altitude Sickness ^altsick
>
> A good decision here can save a lot of problems later on. The Referee might allow a Traveller with the Medic or Survival skill to make a check to realise that the ascent needs to be paced. If any Traveller points out that they are climbing a mountain in an already thin atmosphere, the Referee might illustrate the risk of [[#^altsick|altitude sickness]] and ask if the team are deliberately going slowly to avoid it. The use of respirators negates this effect.
>
> If the Travellers do not specify they are pacing themselves or taking a suitable rest, and they do not have respirators, the Referee is free to assume they are pushing on at what seems to a layman to be a reasonable pace but which is in fact too fast for the conditions.
>
> A party that slows down will make the usual 100 metres per hour in terms of altitude. A party that does not will manage 200 metres in an hour or so but each Traveller without a breather or other supply of oxygen will have to make an Easy (4+) END check.
>
> Those who fail the check suffer mild altitude sickness. The result is that they will begin to tire faster than they expect and may begin to experience faint nausea, headaches and a tendency not to react quickly to changing circumstances. This will not yet be a serious problem, although the Travellers might begin to snap at one another and find simple tasks like retying a bootlace both tricky and intensely annoying. This translates as DM-1 on all checks, even when undertaking purely mental tasks.
>
> Climbers who already have mild symptoms who fail the check are now suffering from moderate symptoms.
>
> Moderate altitude sickness may cause nausea or vomiting, headache and dizziness but worst of all is the strange mental numbness. Sufferers will sometimes just fail to react to obvious things. For example, a climber might keep on plodding numbly forwards when everyone else stops for a rest – and might even walk straight off a ledge in extreme cases. Climbers with moderate altitude sickness suffer DM-2 to all checks until they recover.
>
> Climbers that have managed to fail three checks will be a danger to themselves and everyone else. They stumble about like zombies, suffering from a terrible headache and occasionally vomiting. They respond very sluggishly to changing circumstances – even crises – and struggle with even basic tasks. These people have severe altitude sickness and suffer DM-4 to all checks.
>
> ### RECOVERING FROM ALTITUDE SICKNESS
>
> A climbers's body will try to adjust to the conditions it experiences. As a result, simply resting up for a day or two, especially if the climber can descend a couple of hundred metres from their highest point of ascent, will allow a good recovery to be made. A climber's penalty due to altitude will go down by one for each day of rest at a constant altitude or slightly lower, i.e., each day the climber does not climb any higher. When it reaches zero, a full recovery has been made.
>
> Artificial assistance is also possible. A few minutes of oxygen from a medical unit or vacc suit, or some time spent in the sealed environment of the starship, will dispel the penalty for an hour or two. It will, however, return after that until the Traveller has acclimatised to the conditions properly. A climber who can rest for a significant part of the day (say sleeping for eight hours) in a suitable controlled environment will recover quicker even if they work outside the rest of the time. Their negative DM will go down by one per day in this case. If the climbers were to acclimatise for several weeks, they would eventually become more used to the conditions atop Mount Salbarii, although they would still tire quickly due to the thin air and consequent difficulty in getting enough oxygen. However, they would at that point be capable of functioning more or less normally. Until then, everything they do atop the mountain is harder and more tiring than they would normally expect.

### 1,100–1,200 METRES

The third section is steep and rocky, with little vegetation. There is clear evidence that the mountain was an active volcano in the distant past, with fields of hardened lava and obvious paths where it has flowed. The Travellers are slowed by the terrain but can take a direct route, so can traverse the 100 metres listed in this segment without undue strain in 2Dx10 minutes.

Unfortunately for climbers, this is the domain of the [[#Salbarii Locust]], whose ecosystem is limited to this band of the ascent. They are attacked by a swarm of them and climbers with exposed flesh are attacked until they cover up. As the biting insects descend upon them, the climbers' vision is reduced to approximately two metres and all checks are made at DM-2. There are several ways to address this problem:

- Keen observers will note that the visible swarms are not seen 100 metres below or above them on the mountainside. For whatever reason, they adhere strictly to the 100-metre band that the climbers are attempting to ascend during this phase of the climb. They may hasten their ascent to get beyond the insects' habitat, with the aforementioned DM-2 applied.
- The insects will flee from fire and chemicals. If the climbers have flares, a camp fire or simply an aerosol can and a match, they can force the insects to leave them alone for 4D minutes, possibly giving them time to proceed to the next phase of the climb.
- Locating and hiding in a cave or crevice will cause the insects to give up within 1D minutes. They are clumsy fliers and do not operate well in confined spaces. After the climbers resurface, they get a reprieve of 2D minutes before another swarm notices them.

![[MA1-394.jpg|200]]

The listed bite damage is inflicted by a swarm of 20 or more locusts. Bites from individual locusts merely cause mild discomfort and annoyance. Killing individual locusts is rather easy but does little to affect the behaviour of a swarm. However, they can be driven off by fire, chemicals and similar deterrents and prefer not to pursue prey into enclosed areas such as caves or crevices.

### 1,200–1,350 METRES

This fourth section of the mountain is steep and has numerous hazards in the form of loose rocks, overhangs and sections where there is no alternative but to climb or scramble up a more or less sheer rock face. It will take 1D hours to traverse this section. This might actually be quicker than on the lower slopes since the Travellers are now able to go more or less straight up. No check is needed as the climb is not especially tricky. However, there is another problem.

Another test for [[#^altsick|altitude sickness]] is necessary at this point for any Travellers not equipped with a respirator or other breathing device. This is a Routine (6+) END check for anyone not already suffering and an Average (8+) END check for anyone who has previously been affected. Travellers who fail the check are now suffering from mild [[#^altsick|altitude sickness]], if they were not before, and moderate symptoms if this is the second test they have failed.

Of course, this is not a good time to be uncoordinated or confused. The Travellers will need to make at least one DEX check to scramble up this section. Anyone who fails will fall, skidding down a rocky slope and suffering 2D damage. Precautions like being roped together might mitigate this at the Referee's discretion, although this might put other Travellers in danger. Anyone who fails must try again, with another chance to fall and injure themselves.

**1,350–1,400 METRES** This section is worse than the last but fortunately not that high. It will take another 1D hours to clamber slowly up the rocky face of the mountain, which at times is almost sheer. As the Travellers approach their goal they must make a final END check to avoid [[#^altsick|altitude sickness]].

This is Difficult (10+) for anyone _already suffering any symptoms_ and Average (8+) for those who have not yet begun to suffer. As described before, Travellers with respirators are unaffected.

Climbers who have failed one check are now suffering from mild [[#^altsick|altitude sickness]] (DM-1 to all checks), those who have failed two checks are moderately afflicted (DM-2 to all checks) and

The climb itself requires another DEX check to make without mishap. It may be that some climbers are by now almost incapable of making the climb, in which case their friends will have to get inventive and find a way to help. Failing the DEX check to make the climb results in another fall for 2D damage and the requirement to try again.

### The Crater

The highest point of the crater lip is about 1,500 metres above sea level. However, it is not necessary to go over the highest point. There are several areas where the lip is a good 100 metres lower than the highest point. Most groups of climbers will want to enter by the easiest route they can find, rather than determinedly conquering the summit.

The crater can be considered to be made up of three concentric zones. The outer, or lip, zone is characterised by steep slopes, tumbled rocks and a general lack of life. The inner zone extends from the outer zone edge to the shores of the lake and is an average of 6–800 metres wide. It has soil of a rather thin sort, covered in scrubby grass and in places a forest of waist-high bushes.

The view from the crater lip looking outwards is impressive. South and west are coastal plains falling away to the open ocean. North and east, if anyone travels around the crater rim, the interior of Settlement Island can be seen. The crater is a good one to two kilometres across, with an outer zone sloping steeply down a good 200 metres (to a height of about 1,250-1,300 metres above sea level). There is a fair amount of vegetation in the crater including a scrubby bush-forest and a small lake in a centre. The lake has an island, and on that island is parked the familiar arrowhead shape of a scout/courier. It looks to be intact, although it is surrounded by trash.

Descending into the crater is hard work but not unduly hazardous unless a climber is suffering severe [[#^altsick|altitude sickness]] and cannot keep their balance. However, it will take time to climb down and even longer to get back up if the ship turns out not to be flyable.

The lake lies more or less at the centre of the crater and is about 500 metres in diameter, being roughly circular. There is an island about 100 metres in diameter in the centre of the lake, with vegetation of the same sort as around the lake. The water is warmish and drinkable although it has an odd mineral taste, as might be expected.
