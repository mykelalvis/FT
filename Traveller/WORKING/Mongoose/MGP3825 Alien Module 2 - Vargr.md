##### US$ 34

Callously viewed by other races as thieves, vagabonds and pirates, the wolf-like Vargr are a complex and varied race whose society is light years beyond their stereotype. Alien Module 2: Vargr peels back the layers of prejudice to reveal a fascinating race who have a powerful effect on their region of the galaxy.

The Vargr are the only major race to have been uplifted by the Ancients, a fact that the Vargr are extremely proud of. They are typically seen by other races as aggressive pirates and scavengers but the Vargr actually have a diverse culture that is deeply rooted in their pack mentality and the desire for companionship, charisma and loyalty. Their constant struggle for charisma and leadership results in a culture fuelled by confl ict and change.

This book is packed with information for both players and referees. New rules for careers allow players to create their own Vargr characters, which are then well served by technology and ships designed by and for the Vargr. Chapters are devoted to playing a Vargr and how their society and culture are structured. Finally, we have also included a complete sector to explore, meshing seamlessly with the Spinward Marches – the Gvurrdon sector.

To use this supplement, a Referee will require the Traveller Core Rulebook.

## INTRODUCTION

The Vargr are the only major race to have been uplifted by the Ancients, a fact that the Vargr are extremely proud of. They are typically seen by other races as aggressive pirates and scavengers but the Vargr actually have a diverse culture that is deeply rooted in their pack mentality and the desire for companionship, charisma and loyalty. Their constant struggle for charisma and leadership results in a culture fuelled by confl ict and change.

In the Original Traveller Universe, the Vargr are one of the six races to have independently discovered jump drive technology. These races are commonly referred to as the six Major Races and some groups defi ne these races as the most powerful and dominant species within known space. The other major races are generally considered to be the Aslan, the Droyne, the Hivers, the K'kree and Humaniti (merging the Vilani, Solomani and Zhodani branches of the human race into one).

The Vargr are the subject of this Traveller supplement. With it, the race can be incorporated into any and all aspects of Traveller. Whether the Vargr are to be used as Player Characters, Non- Player Characters, patrons, opponents or just as a backdrop against which adventures may take place, this supplement provides Referees and players with suffi cient information to deal with the Vargr as individual characters and as a culture.

The Traveller Core Rulebook deals with characters as humans within an Imperial society, which is fairly comprehensible to most players. Outside that society, aliens are different in culture as well as physiology and a careful presentation of what shapes an alien's character is necessary if players are to deal with or roleplay those aliens.

Traveller players can fi nd any number of activities which include or deal with Vargr, whether inside the Imperium or beyond its borders. The Vargr Extents (the area of space dominated by the Vargr) is located coreward of the Imperium. This supplement also details Gvurrdon sector, a Vargr controlled sector located directly coreward of the Spinward Marches.

The Vargr have a natural desire to gain infl uence and leadership, which results in much confl ict and infi ghting. Vargr governments continually rise and fall, borders move and allegiances change. Life in the Extents is turbulent and dangerous – the Imperium considers all worlds in the Extents to be Amber Zones unless proven otherwise, with many designated as Red Zones.

There are few human worlds in the extents and no Vargr worlds within the Imperium, but both races coexist in these regions of space. Humans and Vargr have had a chequered history – a number of wars have been fought with these two races fi ghting against, as well as alongside, each other. However, most confl ict between them occurs on the border worlds where Vargr empires seek to expand their borders and corsair raiders attack indiscriminately.

It has been nearly 500 years since the last major confl ict occurred between humans and Vargr. Although relations since then have been relatively peaceful, the Vargr are an unpredictable race that embraces confl ict; it is therefore inevitable that these traits will one day lead to new hostilities.

## VVAARGRRGR CCHHARACTERARACTER GGEENERATIONNERATION

Vargr characters follow the same procedures and concepts as human character generation in Traveller. However, there are a number of changes in the details to represent the differences in physiology, culture and other aspects of Vargr society. Any rules detailed here supersede those in the Traveller Core Rulebook.

#### INITIAL CHARACTER GENERATION

Creating a Vargr character is much the same process as creating a human, with a few notable changes. Vargr characters have six characteristics and Strength, Dexterity, Endurance, Intelligence and Education are the same as human characters. However, Vargr do not have the Social Standing characteristic; this is replaced by Charisma, which measures a character's force of personality and infl uence over other Vargr.

There are a number of subspecies of Vargr as detailed on page 32 of the Vargr Race chapter. However, the vast majority are standard Vargr who tend to be slightly more dexterous than humans, but have less Strength and Endurance. Intelligence and Education are equivalent. Other subspecies are much more rare (many were outcast early in Vargr history) and they compare differently to humans as determined by their traits.

To generate the fi rst fi ve characteristics for a Vargr, roll 2d6 fi ve times and allocate them as normal. These are then adjusted by the traits of the chosen subspecies (listed in the Subspecies table) so for a standard Vargr, Dexterity gains a +1 bonus, while Strength and Endurance both suffer a –1 penalty. The lower limit on characteristics is 1; the upper limit is 15 except for characteristics with the Notable trait, which have an upper limit of 16.

A character's starting Charisma is determined by rolling 1d6+2. Charisma rises and falls with the successes and failures of the character as detailed on page 33.

Traits All subspecies of Vargr have the Natural Weapon (bite) and Uplifted traits (see pages 41 and 42 of the Traveller Core Rulebook). They also have Notable and Weak characteristics depending on the subspecies. With the Referee's permission players can roll or choose one of the Vargr subspecies as listed in the table, otherwise the character will be a standard Vargr. Further details of the Vargr subspecies can be found in the next chapter on page 32.

All Vargr can use their teeth and claws in combat. Teeth do 1d6+1 damage. Vargr claws are not as effective as animal claws and deal standard unarmed damage of 1d6. Teeth and claws can both be used when attacks are made with the Melee
(infi ghting) skill (see page 28 for details).

Vargr have better hearing and smell than humans, giving them a +1 DM to any Recon and Survival checks that use these senses. Vargr eyesight is less effective than humans in darkness, giving them a –1 DM to any skill check involving eyesight in dark conditions.

Vargr are capable of short bursts of speed and may double their movement speed a number of times equal to 3+Endurance DM in any combat. However, each time they do this it counts as one melee attack for the purposes of fatigue (see page 74 of the Traveller Core Rulebook).

Gender Vargr may be male or female. There is roughly the same amount of males as females in Vargr society and there are no distinctions or limitations on what roles they may perform. Players may select their gender or roll 1d6; on a roll of 1–3 the character is male, a roll of 4–6 is female.

SUBSPECIES

| d66 Subspecies Additional Traits
| 11 Kokasha Notable Intelligence (+2), Weak Strength (–2), Weak Endurance (–2)
| 12 Nakagun Notable Psionic Strength (+2), Weak Strength (–2), Weak Endurance (–1), Psionic
| 13 Roth Thokken Notable Psionic Strength (+4), Weak Strength (–2), Weak Endurance (–1), Blind, Psionic
| 14–16 Akumgeda Notable Psionic Strength (+1), Weak Strength (–1), Weak Endurance (–1), Psionic
| 21–26 Urzaeng Notable Dexterity (+1), Notable Strength (+1), Weak Intelligence (–2)
| 31–66 Standard Notable Dexterity (+1), Weak Strength (–1), Weak Endurance (–1)

Starting Age Vargr characters begin their careers at 18 years of age. Untrained and inexperienced they embark on a career to gain new skills, experience and most importantly Charisma. Each career term lasts for four Imperial years.

Naming The language section on page 44 gives some guidelines for creating Vargr words and names. Players are encouraged to choose a Vargr sounding name but should try to pick one that is pronounceable.

Titles Vargr do not have titles of nobility as humans of high Social Standing do. Like most aspects of Vargr society there is no consistent system for titles, different packs and cultures will use their own arbitrary methods of assigning titles, if at all. Characters with a Charisma of 10+ or pack leaders have enough dominance within their pack to select their own title or assign one to subordinates.

Acceptance of a title depends on the Charisma of the individual who receives it but being given a title is usually a sign of praise or respect. Characters who do not wish to keep their title can roll Charisma 8+. If they fail, the title sticks. If they succeed, the title is not used but another might be assigned at a later time.

#### CAREERS

Once they are of age, characters select one of the 11 careers available to all Vargr. It should be noted that Vargr careers are managed on the pack level and with the exception of the Loner career, individuals always work within a pack. Even large organizations are split into smaller groups to maintain the pack structure that is so important to the Vargr.

Qualification Once a career has been selected, the character must attempt to qualify for that career. Due to the nature of Vargr society, qualifying for a career is usually based on Charisma instead of a characteristic more relevant to the type of career. Charisma is therefore used for all careers except Loner, Psion and Scientist.

Vargr characters are expected to change their career often as they gain Charisma, seek new goals or a pack leader fails to live up to expectations. For this reason there are no penalties when moving from one career to another.

If a character fails to qualify, they can take the Drifter (detailed in the Traveller Core Rulebook) or Loner career for this term or they can submit to the Draft. Enlisting in the Draft works exactly the same as detailed on page 9 of the Traveller Core Rulebook

Careers from Other Traveller Books Vargr living in the Imperium or other societies may use other Traveller careers as appropriate. Use the Vargr Life Events table on page 28 for such characters.

but characters roll on the following Draft table and use the specifi ed Vargr career.

| DRAFT
| 1d6 Career (speciality)
| 1–3 Army (any)
| 4 Marines (any)
| 5 Navy (any)
| 6 Law Enforcement (any)

Skills Skills are determined as normal but all Vargr characters automatically get Melee (infi ghting) 0. This represents the natural infi ghting ability of all Vargr. New skills are detailed at the end if this chapter.

The Vargr military works differently to the Imperium and does not have commissioned offi cers; ranks and authority are gained through Charisma and deeds. Consequently, there are no offi cer skills or ranks listed for military careers.

Mustering Out Benefi ts are granted at the end of career service, as per the standard rules.

Vargr and Psionics Vargr characters have the same psionic potential as humans and the same rules apply. Players wishing to create a Vargr Psion must get the Referee's permission and are advised to use the Psion career detailed on page 24. Psion careers from other books can be used to represent training gained on non- Vargr worlds but these characters should still use the Vargr Life Events table.

Although Vargr have the same psionic potential as humans, the primary factor holding back the wide ranging use of psionics amongst the Vargr is the lack or organised research and training facilities. As a result of this, Vargr psions are uncommon in the Extents.

Vargr attitudes towards psionics vary from place to place – many worlds are indifferent but some governments have outlawed the use of psionics, some encourage it and to other cultures such abilities are blasphemous.

#### SKILLS

Two skills are available in Vargr careers that are not detailed in the Traveller Core Rulebook – Infi ghting and Prospecting. Infi ghting is a new speciality for the Melee skill and unique to the Vargr. Prospecting is fully detailed in Adventure 1: Beltstrike but a short description is included here for convenience.

Melee (Infighting) Infi ghting is a Vargr specialization of the Melee skill that combines aspects of Melee (bite) and the Melee (unarmed) skill used by other races. Vargr have unique close combat techniques that involve the use of their teeth and claws. For this reason, Melee
(natural weapons) and Melee (unarmed) are not available to Vargr characters, they use Melee (infi ghting) instead. Melee
(infi ghting) works in much the same way as Melee (unarmed) with the following differences.

Damage depends on the specifi c type of attack as specifi ed by the player. A bite attack (if practical) deals 1d6+1 damage, all other forms of attack deal 1d6 damage. Due to their physiology, Vargr are unable to kick in close combat.

When fi ghting a member of the same race, the Vargr with the highest Charisma gains a +1 DM to their Melee (infi ghting) rolls.

If two Vargr are fi ghting each other, the person losing the fi ght may choose to surrender – this is achieved by ceasing to fi ght and adopting a submissive stance. The winner always accepts the surrender and if he has a lower Charisma than the loser, both characters swap Charisma values (but the winner can never increase his Charisma by more than 3).

Further details of Vargr infi ghting and the role it plays in their society can be found on page 35 of the Vargr Race chapter.

Attacking in melee: Strength or Dexterity, 1–6 seconds, Average
(+0).

Prospecting Prospecting allows the character to search for mineral deposits on planetary surfaces, moons and asteroids. Characters with this skill have a much better chance of discovering deposits than relying on other skills such as Sensors. A successful roll indicates that something of

potential value has been found but there is no guarantee that the initial readings are totally accurate.

Searching for mineral deposits: Intelligence, 1–6 hours, Average
(+0).

#### VARGR LIFE EVENTS

The life events of a Vargr character are similar to those of a human with the addition of pack events. The pack is an important part of a Vargr's life and events that affect the pack will often impact on the character.

PACK EVENTS These events affect the character's pack and their position within the group.

1d6 Event 1 Failure: Your failure causes a serious problem for your pack such as the loss of a well paid job or the death of a pack member. Your Charisma is reduced by 1. If you are the leader, your pack will look to new leadership until you can redeem yourself. 2 Leave Pack: A change of situation, disagreement or lack of leadership forces you to leave your pack and your job. If you are not in any other packs, roll Charisma 6+ to fi nd another job or you are ejected from your career. 3 Join Pack: You join a new pack. This can be a change of job or employer within your career, or you become involved with another group such as a religion or recreational group. 4 Power Struggle: The leader of your pack does not live up to the reputation his Charisma suggested and you look to other members to replace him. Roll 1d6. On a roll of 1–3 the current leader keeps his position; gain a Rival.

The Vargr are a race of intelligent beings; they are unique amongst the major races as the only species to have been genetically engineered by the Ancients, a fact that the Vargr are extremely proud of. They are typically seen by other races as pirates and scavengers but they are actually a diverse people that can be found in all walks of life.

#### VARGR PHYSIOLOGY

The Vargr are descended from carnivore/chaser stock; genetically engineered by the Ancients circa –300,000 from the genus Canis. The carnivores were transplanted from Terra to Lair/Grnouf in the Provence sector. Although the Vargr were artifi cially developed, a certain amount of evolution and natural selection took place as the species adapted to the conditions on Lair without further manipulation by the Ancients.

Male Vargr typically weigh 60 kilograms and stand 1.6 meters high. Females tend to be smaller and average 1.5 meters in height and weigh 55 kilograms.

The Vargr bear a close resemblance to their canine ancestry, as can be seen by their muzzle, tail and fur. The latter covers their entire body and can be found in a variety of colours. The most common colour is grey but it is not uncommon to see Vargr with brown, black or even red fur. Fur colour is partly determined by climate with those from colder regions displaying a greater variety of colours than those from warmer climates. Parents from different climates will often result in their offspring having patterned fur with the stronger bloodline being the most dominant colour. Tail characteristics such as length and bushiness also vary greatly between Vargr from different ethnic backgrounds.

Several anatomical modifi cations were made by the Ancients to the canine body structure, the most signifi cant being the stance, forepaws and muzzle. Vargr adopt a digitigrade stance (putting their weight on their toes rather than the soles of their feet) and many have a slight stoop although most Vargr would say it is a
'relaxed stance'. Vargr hands are similar in size and functionality to human hands but the internal structure is quite different and unique to the Vargr. Muzzles are shorter than that of their canine ancestors, which is largely due to dietary considerations.

Three hundred thousand years of evolution on Lair resulted in the Vargr adapting to the 26 hour rotation of their homeworld and this circadian rhythm is shared by all Vargr. However, the Vargr remain extremely fl exible in their sleeping habits adopting a polyurnal sleep pattern where they prefer to sleep several times a day for short periods rather than one single long sleep period.

## TTHHEE VVAARGRRGR RRAACECE

Time-Keeping For many Traveller activities and adventures there is a need to keep track of the passage of time. The Imperial measurements are the standard used by most people and due to the diversity of the Vargr cultures, Imperial methods are often used for convenience and consistency.

Imperial Standards: Timekeeping in the Imperium is based on the standard day, which is composed of 24 standard hours. Timekeeping devices use standard hours, minutes and seconds. The Imperial calendar is divided into 365 days, consisting of 52 seven day weeks. Days are numbered from 1 to 365.

Vargr Standards: Like so many aspects of Vargr society, timekeeping can vary between governments, worlds and even packs. Most worlds have a time system based on the length of the local day. A number of scientifi c standards
(a close approximation to Imperial standards) were developed centuries ago but these methods are now only used by the Vargr scientifi c community.

Like their daily timekeeping, Vargr calendars vary from one place to another and are usually based on the local solar year of that planet and in some cases the same method is used over larger areas of space but rarely goes beyond the system. Unlike the Imperial calendar that starts at year 0 (the date the Imperium was founded), Vargr calendars date from whatever local event the government or population decide to use as the starting point. This is usually the date that the planet was settled or a government was formed but more unusual events have also been used.

For game purposes Imperial timekeeping can be used when dealing with the Vargr but Referees can develop their own time systems for specifi c Vargr worlds or groups as required.

Vargr will adapt their sleeping habits to their circumstances but will typically sleep after meals or through particularly hot or cold periods in the local climate.

The Vargr gestation period is usually four months. Most litters have only two young but litters with as many as fi ve pups have been known. Pups are born blind and deaf, completely reliant on their parents to care for them for the fi rst four months until

Diet Vargr are a carnivorous species with the bulk of their diet being fresh, raw meat. Uncooked fruits and fruit-based drinks are also popular amongst Vargr but lack the nourishment needed for a healthy lifestyle. Vargr metabolism is faster and more effi cient than the human digestive system, meaning that Vargr eat more frequently but they are able to fast for longer periods if necessary.

Although the Vargr adapted to conditions on Lair and the indigenous wildlife was edible, it was not as appetising as the meats that canines had become accustomed to on Terra. Vargr chefs spent much time and effort to fi nd herbs, spices and seasoning that would make the food on Lair more appealing. Gourmets developed these into sauces and dressings to further enhance Vargr meals.

Selective breeding of livestock was also undertaken to improve local food and make it more appetising. This practice continues to this day on most Vargr worlds and comprises much of the interstellar trade in the Vargr Extents.

their senses develop. Vargr females are able to conceive soon after giving birth but will rarely do so until their pups are old enough to take care of themselves at the age of six.

Vargr share the same senses as humans but they tend to be more acute. Olfactory receptors develop very quickly to compensate for a pup's lack of sight and sound, resulting in a keen sense of smell that Vargr use to recognize each other. Vargr hearing is also much better than a human's, able to detect a greater range of frequencies over longer distances; humans are more sensitive to low frequencies and Vargr are able to hear high frequency sounds that are inaudible to humans. Vargr eyesight is sharp but less sensitive to colour than human eyes and is less effective in dark conditions.

Lifespan Vargr living in industrial areas usually live for 65 to 75 years. Pre-industrial Vargr have a shorter lifespan due to poor living or environmental conditions and a lack of medical advances. The lifespan for Vargr in higher technological cultures is increased with advancements in anagathics and medical treatment.

Roth Thokken: This subspecies settled in Angfutsag sector and although they look similar to the Nakagun, they are even more peculiar. Their psionic powers are said to be even stranger and more powerful. Further to this, all Roth Thokken are permanently blind from birth. This superstitious group live in seclusion and are known to perform bizarre rituals using psionic senses unknown to anyone outside their group.

#### SOCIETY

The Vargr are a dynamic people, their governments and businesses are constantly changing with the loyalties and goals of individual Vargr. Many humans see this as anarchic but this is not the case at all. Vargr society is deeply rooted in charisma, loyalty, racial pride and the need for companionship and approval.

Genetic Instinct In addition to many of the physical features of their canine ancestors, the Vargr have also inherited some of the behavioural traits as well; few Vargr are aware of how deeply rooted these traits are in their subconscious. Pre-sentient canines constantly crave approval, much more so than humans and most other races. This can be seen in nature where wild dogs or wolves seek approval from the pack's leader. This cooperative nature greatly improves their chance of survival. Likewise, domestic canines seek approval from their master, which makes them very loyal and easy to train.

It was these qualities that the Ancients wanted to exploit, genetically engineering the genus Canis to be intelligent beings to serve the needs of the Ancients. The canine traits are so strong in the Vargr that they have changed little in the evolution of the species, which is evident in the behaviour of all Vargr today.

Packs The genetic instinct of the Vargr is most evident in the pack culture of their society. Like many species, the Vargr seek the companionship of others for comfort and security. Although this is found within the family, the gregarious nature of the Vargr gives them a drive to connect with others and a need to belong to other groups. This arises from both their natural need for approval and their racial pride that unites all Vargr with a sense of solidarity and camaraderie.

Vargr packs vary greatly in form and function. Some common types of pack include the family pack, businesses, religions, recreational groups, governments, military units and the infamous corsair bands. Most Vargr belong to several packs, loyal to each one for different reasons and proud to have many commitments and loyal brethren.

Subspecies A little known fact to most outsiders is the number of Vargr subspecies that exist within the Extents. Most of these ethnic minorities were seen as deviations from the 'perfected' Vargr race developed by the Ancients and were the victims of prejudice and racial abuse that prompted many of them to leave Vargr society and settle in the unpopulated regions of Vargr space. Most of these subspecies remain unknown to the Imperium and even Vargr knowledge is limited since the subspecies were outcast from Vargr society so long ago.

The game mechanics for the subspecies listed here can be found on page 3 of the Character Creation chapter.

Urzaeng: The Urzaeng are one of the few subspecies known to the Imperium and the only subspecies that were not outcast by Vargr society due to their superior physical prowess. Urzaeng average 1.85 meters in height and weigh 70 kilograms. They are more powerfully built than the average human and are physically a match against an adult Aslan. The Urzaeng were originally bred by the Ancients for heavy labour and combat so their increased physical prowess comes at a cost to their mental characteristics. This has resulted in the Urzaeng being a naturally violent people with contempt for weakness.

Kokasha: The Kokasha are all but extinct now and those that remain live in a refuge in Rukhs Dall (known as Trenchans sector in the Imperium). They are the smallest of the subspecies and were engineered by the Ancients to have heightened mental faculties at the expense of their physical attributes. Kokasha are typically 1.45 meters high and weigh 50 kilograms. Females are slightly smaller averaging 1.4 meters high and weighing 45 kilograms.

Akumgeda: Like most other subspecies of Vargr, the Akumgeda fl ed Lair after their people were ostracised by the majority of the Vargr population. The Akumgeda settled on a number of worlds in Ksinanirz sector and although some of these settlements still exist, many of the packs reintegrated with their brethren as the Vargr expanded throughout the Extents.

The Akumgeda appear much like normal Vargr but they tend to have spotted fur. Although unusual, spots are not unknown and the Akumgeda found it easy to blend in with 'normal Vargr' unnoticed. What set the Akumgeda apart was their strong psionic ability. Some Vargr postulate that the standard Vargr species only developed psionic powers since the Akumgeda reintegrated with Vargr society but there is no evidence to support this.

Nakagun: This outcast subspecies live in exile in Nakagun sector and are known to possess strange psionic powers. Males and females are similar in size averaging 1.5 meters in height and weighing 55 kilograms. Little else is known of this group since they fl ed from Lair over a thousand years ago.

Gaining & Losing Charisma A Vargr character's Charisma can change during the course of the game as long as they are responsible for the success or failure of any given task; if a character is using their initiative and making choices, the outcome of those decisions can raise or lower their Charisma. For example, a pilot who misjumps due to a damaged jump drive would not be responsible for the failure, whereas a pilot who destroys a superior vessel due to clever thinking and good piloting would be responsible for the success and therefore would have a chance to increase their Charisma.

Charisma Gain: Providing the character is responsible for a noteworthy success where they have shown initiative or completed a task against diffi cult odds, the character makes a Diffi cult (–2 DM) Charisma check. If successful, they increase their Charisma by 1.

Charisma Loss: If the character is responsible for a signifi cant failure, the character makes a Diffi cult Charisma check. If they fail, they reduce their Charisma by 1.

When making these checks, it is important that the character has earned the gain or deserved the loss either through their actions or decisions. Referees may also change the task diffi culty of these checks as appropriate to the signifi cance of the outcome. For example, a character who saves the pack by spotting a trap and taking out the enemy might have a task diffi culty of Average when making the Charisma check.

Characters making Charisma checks of this kind can use Leadership if they have the skill and it is appropriate to the situation. For example, a pack leader who fails in his duties can use his Leadership skill (including the Charisma DM) to avoid losing Charisma.

The pack mentality of the Vargr means that they require leadership in order to function effectively so anytime a pack leader loses Charisma or if the leader is injured or killed, the pack will look for new leadership. The new leader will usually be the most Charismatic member of the pack but this can be tied and other individuals might join the struggle for power. If the new leadership is contested, everyone vying for the position makes a Charisma or Leadership check and the person with the highest roll wins the battle for leadership and instantly gains 1 Charisma (no check required).

A pack leader who is stripped of his position must reduce their Charisma by 1 without making a Charisma or Leadership check. This reduction is in addition to the Charisma loss of the failure itself.

Individuality is still important within the pack and each member strives to become the most dominant within the group. This contest for leadership is based on an individual's charisma and infl uence. Even though members of a pack are competitive, the good of the pack comes fi rst and members know that they can always count on their peers for assistance, companionship and support in times of need.

Large organizations usually consist of several packs divided by their roles or specialities. Where several packs exist in a single organization, a hierarchy exists where the leader of each one answers to the primary pack. This takes power struggles to new levels as individuals not only compete for dominance within their

NON-VARGR CHARISMA For situations where humans or other races are interacting with Vargr, it might become necessary to make Charisma checks for non-Vargr characters. For the purpose of such tests, treat all non-Vargr as having Charisma equal to one quarter of their Social Standing
(rounded down).

own pack but with other packs in the organization – a leader of one pack might seek to become the leader of another or he may try to make his pack more dominant within the organization.

Charisma & Loyalty At the heart of Vargr psychology is the concept of charisma, which the Vargr defi ne as an individual's prestige and force of personality that attracts other Vargr. This, combined with the pack mentality, is the foundation for Vargr society and the driving force behind their constant change in leadership, whether in a pack of scavengers or the local government.

The Vargr desire to constantly increase their charisma makes them a competitive race, always seeking to improve their standing amongst the pack. It is this charisma that gives them their focus and drive. Whilst many humans see this as a fl aw it is one of the reasons that the Vargr have become such a prominent race.

Charisma is gained or lost by word and deed. Vargr characters are usually keen to perform special or diffi cult duties if it means they will gain standing by doing so. This behaviour means that Vargr always try their best in the hope of gaining charisma and the fear of losing it – very few Vargr are lazy or procrastinate when they have duties to perform.

Vargr always look to the most charismatic person in the pack for leadership and that individual will only maintain his position by proving that he has the ability and force of personality to lead his pack. All Vargr respect a leader who has a greater charisma than their own and likewise they have a responsibility to those with a lower charisma who submit to their authority.

A leader might not have the skills to effectively lead the pack but his charisma gains him the loyalty of everyone in the group. Contrary to popular belief, a Vargr's loyalty is very strong and will only waver if the pack leader fails to meet the needs of his people and thus loses charisma. Loyalties may change but never quickly and never without reason. It is this fact that seems to have gone unnoticed by many outsiders who often regard the Vargr's loyalty as volatile at best and mutinous at worst.

Should a leader be found to lack the skills to lead his people, members will look to others within the pack that have the charisma to take control. This may seem strange and unproductive to other races but this behaviour always ensures that the strongest person is in charge of a pack.

A Vargr's Charisma fl uctuates over time with the decisions they make and the actions and activities they perform. Great successes and heroic deeds will add to an individual's Charisma, whereas critical failures will reduce Charisma.

If a Vargr loses Charisma he will not necessarily lose face amongst his brethren. Adversity is often seen as an opportunity to raise ones Charisma rather than a burden to be suffered. Vargr will often take risks in the hope of improving their Charisma but this does not always make them reckless, such situations will be considered with care before being undertaken.

A result of the constant drive to improve Charisma and their need for approval is that Vargr do not respond well to formal authority. This also decreases as that authority becomes more remote. Vargr are much more likely to obey superiors that are better known and able to exert their charisma, whereas leaders who are not present to prove they are worthy of the position and praise their subordinates will gain little respect.

It is also important to note that whilst charisma and the constant struggle for dominance plays an important role in Vargr society, not all Vargr are blessed with a natural charisma or even the drive to partake in the power play of pack leadership.

Racial Pride The Vargr see themselves as a unique people, a race chosen by the Ancients and uplifted to be an intelligent race. In their eyes, this makes the Vargr special and sets them apart from the other major races, since only the Vargr have such esteemed origins.

This pride not only unites the Vargr as a race but it takes other forms as well. Some groups believe in racial superiority, which has led to two schools of thought on the subject. Those who follow the so called 'high superiority' school propose that the Vargr were designed to be better than other races, that the Ancients designed them to be nothing less than perfect. Proponents of the
'low superiority' school maintain that they were the original sapient race on Terra and the Ancients moved them to Lair so the Vargr would not interfere with the genetic engineering of humans from the [[Terra|Terran]] apes.

As with all things in Vargr society, there are numerous other ideas supported by scientists, politicians and religious groups. A minority of Vargr even have the view that their origins make them an inferior race and these troubled souls feel that they have to prove their worth by taking dangerous and extraordinary actions.

With so many takes on racial pride, it is important to note that most Vargr lie somewhere between these extremes and are content in the knowledge that they are a special and unique race

- from humble beginnings they were chosen by the Ancients and eventually reached the stars.

Family The family is a pack of blood relatives and it is in this environment that pups fi rst learn about the pack structure of Vargr society. The family operates much like any Vargr pack and pups quickly learn to recognize charisma and develop their own personality. Young

members of a family must show the proper respect to the family leader and establish their own position within the pack by improving their own charisma. This learning curve is crucial training for a young pup.

In agrarian or pre-industrial societies, the family pack tends to be larger than those in more advanced cultures. On a low technology world, a larger family means a greater number of hunters that are essential to the pack's survival. However if a pack grows too large it becomes less effective, especially if the pups and elderly outnumber the more able-bodied members as it places an additional burden on the hunters, threatening the survival of the pack. Larger packs are also more noticeable making it diffi cult to hunt the local wildlife.

Vargr families become smaller as technology increases and the economy moves towards industry. Industrial based societies require large workforces so parents spend much of their time working and less time raising their families. Raising pups in the family environment is essential for their development so most Vargr females on these worlds will only give birth to one litter in their lifetime.

In higher technology societies where much of the workforce is automated, the demands on family members are reduced and they are better able to raise their pups in a more traditional manner. Female Vargr on these worlds will therefore give birth to several litters and the average family size is more akin to that of pre-industrial societies.

Beliefs Religion is as diverse and varied as every other aspect of Vargr society. Many religions stem from the Vargr's pride in their origins and the Ancients are venerated as gods by many groups. What humans would consider orthodox religions also exist in great numbers but they are not as common as the belief in the Ancients.

Vargr who fi nd religion come from all backgrounds and there is no specifi c career for religious characters. Many who do devote themselves to a religion will continue in their chosen career but some will also change profession to better follow their faith, this is especially true of loners who are more likely to seek the companionship of their fellow believers. Religious leaders often have a background as emissaries but this is not always the case.

Church of the Chosen Ones: This religion was established in the year 895 of the Imperial calendar and for a short period it was one of the largest and most infl uential religious movements in Vargr society. Although the religion is not as popular as it once was, most Vargr have heard of the Church of the Chosen Ones.

The religion postulates that not only did the Ancients create the Vargr by genetically engineering [[Terra|Terran]] canines but that the Ancients continued to return to Lair to make improvements until they created the superior race that Vargr are today. To followers of the Church of the Chosen Ones, this also explains the existence of the other Vargr subspecies; they were simply mistakes abandoned by the Ancients.

Congregations tend to live in their own communes and each commune has its own particular traditions, dress codes and practices such as wearing only white clothes, wearing an embroidered sash or adorning themselves with a particular marking or tattoo.

The popularity in this religion has declined in recent years and there are now thought to be around 20 branches remaining in the Extents, although each branch usually consists of multiple congregations. Infrequent surges of popularity boost the number of followers but not in suffi cient quantity to rival its popularity in the early days. Many scientists have discredited the claims made by the Church but it has not swayed the remaining fanatics from their beliefs.

Faarzgaen: This is a religion of fanatics who believe in a single god, Faarzgaen, who continually guides all who worship him and determines how they should live and act; if a follower of Faarzgaen is hungry then he wants them to eat, if they are tired then he wants them to sleep and if they have the urge to take a life then Faarzgaen wants them to kill someone.

Followers of this faith believe that Faarzgaen is the one true god and his religion is the only true faith. Anyone who does not follow Faarzgaen is a heretic. Worshippers of Faarzgaen spread their religion by forcing it on others using fear and violence.

This fanatical behaviour has lead worshippers of Faarzgaen to believe that they are the only ones fi t to rule the universe and have become a powerful organization that is feared by many Vargr. On some worlds the religion has become a ruling power, oppressing their subjects until they submit to the one true faith.

The religion and the few states they control are run by seven overlords known as Kafaazgaen. To become a Kafaazgaen a priest must commit a number of violent acts, including the assassination of a serving Kafaazgaen, in order to take that position.

#### INFIGHTING

Infi ghting is unique to the Vargr and is more than just a combat skill; it forms part of their struggle for power and Charisma within their pack. There are times when dominance cannot be decided by Charisma alone and in these situations the Vargr will succumb to the more primitive means of tooth and claw. Infi ghting is also used to frequently settle disputes and insults.

Infi ghting is similar to a duel but the participants are fi ghting for charisma and loyalty, not honor and pride. This may seem to be a small distinction to humans but to Vargr, and indeed the Aslan (who duel for honor), the difference is considerable. Infi ghting is not so much about injuring or killing the opponent but getting them to submit and thus proving that the victor is the most dominant.

Whenever two Vargr are battling for dominance within a pack and loyalty is divided or one Vargr questions the abilities or leadership of another, one challenges the other to a fi ght. Such infi ghting is not necessarily for the role of pack leader but simply for one Vargr to raise their position above another and slowly raise their Charisma and status within the pack. A pack member might also challenge someone of lower Charisma to prove they remain superior to their subordinates.

Infi ghting is a fast way for pack members with low Charisma to rise through the ranks; if the victor has a lower Charisma then the two combatants swap Charisma values. However, it is important to remember that Vargr are primarily driven by Charisma, so they will only resort to infi ghting when the need arises. A common situation for a challenge is when a Vargr fails a task but does not lose Charisma, rival pack members will be disappointed by this and will often challenge the one who failed, questioning their abilities or leadership.

Individuals who constantly challenge their comrades will usually lose Charisma and in some cases are cast out from the pack. Exploiting one's prowess in combat as an easy way of gaining Charisma is seen as un-Vargr like and is not tolerated. Infi ghting has its rightful place but it is not an alternative to Charisma, it is just one of many aspects of the Vargr struggle for dominance.

#### DRESS, ART & ARCHITECTURE

Due to Vargr eyesight being less sensitive to colour, their clothes and decorations are often made up of bright colours that appear garish to humans. Clothes tend to be tight fi tting and practical but cloaks and capes are not uncommon. Most Vargr prefer to forego footwear but this varies between locations and cultures; shoes and boots tend to be used for practical reasons such as armor or regions with rough terrain and cold climates.

Art follows a similar trend, with a preference toward bright colours using a variety of styles and techniques. Paintings and sculptures often depict charismatic leaders and renowned Vargr packs. Corsair bands are also a common subject of paintings, stories and poetry.

As one would expect from such a diverse race, Vargr architecture varies widely not just between locations and cultures but within the same settlements. Designs are typically asymmetrical and have a lot of ornamentation. The garish colours of one building

often clash with neighboring structures making Vargr cities appear chaotic and disorganised.

The gregarious nature of the Vargr manifests in their architecture, resulting in wide communal areas and open plan offi ces. This can even be seen on a larger scale with most settlements having large open areas for markets and recreational uses.

An important feature of most buildings is that they are rarely designed with a particular use in mind. The continuous changes in Vargr society means that buildings constantly change in ownership and function. For this reason, it is important that a building can be easily adapted to the needs of its occupants; a building might be a government offi ce one day, a junk dealership the next and a month later it could be a fi ne restaurant.

Tattoos & Markings A popular tradition amongst the Vargr, especially in military and corsair packs, is tattooing their bodies or painting armor to show past deeds. Pack members will use a variety of symbols painted in different colours to represent different types of deeds such as victories, kills and leadership achievements. Rank and pack insignia are also common tattoos. Like so many aspects of Vargr culture, their tattoos are constantly changing as new victories are won and achievements are gained.

Due to their fur, tattoos are generally applied to the face where the fur is short. Some Vargr have been known to dye their hair or shave patches of fur but most will simply paint the required symbols on their armor, clothes and weapons. In this context, symbols painted on items are often referred to as tattoos as there is no distinction between the two.

The meaning of symbols and colours varies from one pack to the next and in some groups the location of the design is also relevant. In most packs, the meaning is derived from only one characteristic of colour, location or symbol; the remaining aspects are simply an expression of the individual. Some typical meanings are listed in the table below but this is by no means an exhaustive list.

Symbol Meaning Icon Varies according to language and culture and can mean anything or nothing if the meaning comes from the colour or location. Green Victory. Red Kill or victory. White Often used by packs where the symbol or location has meaning but the colour does not. Yellow Leadership or charisma. Chest Victory or achievement. Forearm Kill. Head Leadership. Leg Achievement. Shoulder Rank or pack insignia.

#### GOVERNMENT

The Vargr government is nothing like that of other races. The very nature of the Vargr means that there is no single government or centralised authority in the Extents. Vargr space is therefore made up of many separate governments, each one controlling a small region or state.

Each state has its own ruling body and the type of government varies greatly from place to place. Every type of government organization can be found in the Vargr Extents from no government structure to dictatorships. It is not uncommon for a world to have different government types controlling each region.

There are two main reasons why Vargr space has become so politically diverse and fragmented.

Firstly, Vargr do not respond well to remote authority so governments become more unstable the larger their sphere of infl uence. Titles and positions of offi ce have little meaning to the Vargr; instead the importance is placed on the charisma of the person in the role. Regardless of their charisma, distant leaders are unable to directly infl uence or inspire their subordinates and remote leaders are not there to give praise when it is due. Without direct involvement with the pack, a superior will rarely maintain the respect and loyalty of his subordinates.

The second reason is also related to the Vargr mentality. The lack of respect for remote authority also means that government boundaries have little meaning to Vargr. They expect their

The Vargr Homeworld LAIR A8859B9-F The Vargr homeworld has many names amongst the Vargr people but for convenience it is referred to by its Imperial designation, Lair. Many Vargr see it as an insult to refer to their homeworld with a human term but it is becoming more accepted for trade purposes. The Vargr do not even attach any special signifi cance or status to their homeworld like most races do.

Lair is located in hex 2402 of Grnouf subsector. Grnouf is subsector C of Provence sector. The Lair system has a single star, eight planetary bodies and a planetoid belt.

Lair is 12,811 kilometers in diameter with a dense atmosphere. Roughly 50% of the world is covered with water oceans. It is a temperate world with average temperatures ranging from 37° C at the equator to –38° C at the poles. Three of the major land masses lie between these two extremes with temperatures averaging between 5° C to 26° C, free from the fi erce storms experienced at other latitudes.

There are fi ve major landmasses on Lair. The largest continent is Safokunggaru, a mountainous region located on the equator. The twin continents of Onfakh Gurz and Onfakh Dzae were once a single continent but tectonic shifts split them in two. Just north of the equator, the continent of Aerueko Fen extends across the hemisphere with tundra at its northern tip and jungle to the south. In the southern polar region lies Gaksadudha, a frozen continent of snow, ice and rock.

The very fi rst Vargr made their home on the continent of Aerueko Fen, on what became known as the Arrak plains located north of the Dzuengfuerr jungle. To this day Aerueko Fen remains the most heavily populated region on Lair.

Lair has a population of 2.6 billion people, consisting mainly of Vargr but some humans and other races have made their home here. Cities and industry have replaced much of the natural landscape to support the needs of the people but dedicated agricultural regions remain for crops and livestock.

Although this tradition is followed by many Vargr, it is by no means practiced by all groups. Some individuals abstain from the custom, preferring their deeds to speak for themselves rather than displaying them in such an obvious manner.

ruling body to provide charismatic leaders who walk among the people and they also require a great deal of personal freedom and liberty. When Vargr are not satisfi ed with their leadership and are not in a position to exert their charisma, they will simply move elsewhere. If there are enough unsatisfi ed Vargr, the group might attempt to overthrow the government or start their own state (in their current location or elsewhere).

Another factor that distinguishes Vargr from humans and other races is what the Vargr expect from their government. To the Vargr, a government is seen more as an institution that provides a service to its people, rather than a ruling body. A government is expected to provide protection without imposing too many restrictions or limitations on its people.

Governments only succeed if their assistance is accepted by the people; this can only be achieved by appointing individuals who can maintain the confi dence and respect of the people under its sphere of infl uence. This is a diffi cult task by Vargr standards and only the most charismatic succeed. Those who lack the force of personality to retain the loyalty of their people are soon pushed out of power by those with a greater following. This can often lead to a power struggle that can destabilize the government if not resolved quickly.

Some of the most notable Vargr governments of Provence sector are listed on page 53 of the History chapter.

Law Just as Vargr do not put much stock in borders and remote authority, the laws of a government are considered fl exible at best. Governments have little control over their citizens and laws are obeyed only as much as the government is able to enforce them. Charismatic leaders will gain followers regardless of whether their activities are legal or illegal.

On most Vargr worlds, the law enforcement is handled by the local government. Some larger nations exert greater control over local divisions or might replace them entirely depending on the control they need to enforce on their citizens.

Emissaries The number and variety of Vargr governments makes diplomacy very diffi cult. Disputes arise over a variety of matters and when two or more charismatic leaders (of packs or governments) are involved the situation can quickly resort to violence without the intervention of intermediaries.

A specialized group of mediators, known as emissaries, has arisen to meet the needs of disputing parties. Emissaries are highly skilled diplomats who are much sought after for their experience in negotiation and diplomacy. These individuals are greatly respected and well paid for their services. They are used as much in corporate dealings as they are for political negotiations.

Other races on the borders of Vargr territories are often subject to raids by independent corsair bands. This has lead to many misunderstandings and political disputes since few outsiders understand the Vargr's apparent lack of respect for authority. Of course this is a matter of perspective but one that still causes numerous interstellar incidents, which have on occasion been known to lead to hostilities and even war.

In these situations emissaries are frequently called to mediate on behalf of Vargr governments. Emissaries are usually successful in creating the peace or at least avoiding further hostilities. In the cases of raids and unprovoked attacks, reparations are usually given to the victim as a gesture of good will.

#### BUSINESS

Due to the constant fl ux of Vargr leadership within their packs, they do not have anything approaching the large companies and megacorporations found in other races. The hierarchy and remote authority necessary to run a large corporation is something that simply does not work with the Vargr mindset. Vargr workers who are unsatisfi ed with their jobs or feel undervalued or underpaid also have a tendency to simply look for new leadership within the company or fi nd a new job to suit their needs.

The larger corporations that are successful have done so by splitting their organization into smaller subsidiary companies, thus reducing the remote authority and keeping the feel of a smaller company, at least as far as the workers are concerned. These businesses are most successful when working on the subsector level and most operate in the shipping and interstellar trade markets.

As one would expect with the Vargr mindset their businesses come and go with astonishing frequency, much more so than any other race. This might seem to have a negative impact on trade but this environment prevents capital from being tied up in unprofi table businesses. Companies must also be continually vigilant and progressive; new innovations for effi ciency are fundamental for businesses to remain competitive.

The nature of Vargr business has made a number of professions both lucrative and essential to the Vargr economy. The most signifi cant three are listed below.

Junk Dealer: The junk dealer, also known as second-hand equipment merchant, is one of the most common professions in Vargr society. Anyone can set themselves up as a junk dealer with minimal collateral and there is never a shortage of second- hand goods. As Vargr businesses rise and fall, leftover goods and unwanted equipment is always available for those who know where to look.

Some businesses will search for goods themselves but without the knowledge and connections this can be a time consuming

task, especially if rare or specifi c items are required. The majority of second-hand equipment is purchased quickly and cheaply by junk dealers who then sell it on to corporations or scroungers, making a signifi cant profi t in the process.

Many junk dealers are independent traders with small to medium size establishments but larger second hand dealerships also exist with vast warehouses and numerous dealers on the payroll.

Junk dealers are a specialization of the Merchant career as detailed on page 20 of the Vargr Character Generation chapter.

Scrounger: Scroungers are specialist brokers, working both independently or for corporations. Companies with a good scrounger on the payroll will save a lot more money than it costs to hire their services.

Bargains can be found throughout the Vargr Extents but the right skills and knowledge are required to fi nd them. Scroungers are experts in this fi eld and can fi nd just about anything a company or individual might need, from raw materials to high-tech goods. They will often purchase goods from junk dealers but they will also try to cut out the middleman if the opportunity arises.

Scroungers are a specialization of the Merchant career as detailed on page 20 of the Vargr Character Generation chapter.

Contingency Expert: A contingency expert fulfi ls a similar role to the scrounger. Businesses rely on each other to provide goods and services; in the fl uctuating world of Vargr business it is essential to ensure that if one supplier stops trading, a replacement can be found quickly and effi ciently to reduce the loss of sales and productivity.

Contingency experts use the Scrounger specialization of the Merchant career as detailed on page 20 of the Vargr Character Generation chapter.

Economy The many governments and states of Vargr society mean that there is no global economy in the Extents. Due to the rapid rise and fall of Vargr businesses, the local economy of each government and world fl uctuates wildly. Prices vary from place to place by as much as 30%. When purchasing equipment and services, Referees should alter the costs by ±15% by adding 2d6–7 x 3 percent to the list price.

Likewise, salaries also vary but this is very much based on Charisma; the higher the Charisma, the greater the wage and responsibility. Basic salaries are usually reduced by 5% per level of difference between the Charisma of the worker and the pack leader.

Vargr will usually haggle and negotiate to get a higher salary or a better price for whatever goods or services they are purchasing. Busy areas of trade such as spaceports and marketplaces are a cacophony of raised voices with bartering, intense negotiations and angry consumers.

Due to the fragile nature of Vargr economics, bank lending and fi nance options are virtually unheard of. Investment opportunities are also uncommon for the same reasons. Businesses are so unstable that lenders and investors must not only be convinced of a return but they will demand some sort of collateral to protect their investment and even this happens rarely.

#### THE MILITARY

The Vargr military conforms to no standard conventions. Local governments have their own forces, each varying in organization, technology and strength. Larger states might control all the military of their member worlds or rely on local forces. For most worlds, the military comprises of three divisions: army, navy and marines.

Each military division consists of a number of packs, with each pack forming a unit. Standards and tactics tend to operate on a unit level depending on the abilities of the current leader and change with the leadership within the pack. Units are often grouped into a variety of regiments, battalions, platoons and squads, but being Vargr this is not always the case. Larger military organizations tend to have a more formal hierarchy but again, this varies between governments.

Ranks vary from one group to another. Many divisions have their own arbitrary ranks issued on a whim, whilst others have a more formal hierarchy in place. The usual infi ghting occurs in the military as it does in other Vargr packs and individuals are promoted on their force of personality rather than their skills in leadership or battle. The result of this is that offi cers are often promoted to commanding positions but lack the skills needed for military leadership and tactics.

In addition to the power struggles within a pack, there is also a jockeying for position between different units. Some packs seek to become more dominant than others in their division and leaders jockey for command of more prestigious units, often bringing members of their own pack with them.

Once in a commanding position, leaders must live up to the expectations that earned them the promotion. Leaders that fail to command their men to success are soon replaced by more charismatic individuals and those who get demoted usually lose Charisma in the process.

The result of the Vargr mentality means that their military is somewhat volatile. This instability not only affects the organization and leadership but can have a great impact on

morale as well. Although this behaviour often benefi ts the Vargr it can also be a disruptive infl uence. It is not uncommon for charismatic individuals to gain popularity in resisting higher authorities for a number of reasons, causing disputes and strikes to demand better conditions, equipment and pay.

Mutinies have also been known to occur but such extreme shifts in loyalty happen infrequently. These acts have been known to turn the tide of battle as units and entire battalions have deserted or even changed sides during a confl ict; such is the nature of the Vargr. However, such behaviour is discouraged and considered treason by many governments and the punishments can be quite severe.

Humans and indeed many other races fi nd the Vargr concept of leadership diffi cult to understand but from the Vargr perspective it makes perfect sense; if a leader proves he is not capable of commanding his men it is important to replace him with a charismatic leader who can, especially in combat situations.

Morale Vargr gregariousness and their need for leadership makes them very effective when they have a charismatic leader but if that leader is not capable it can have a devastating effect on morale. Likewise, if a leader is killed during a battle and another suitable leader does not take command or is unable to inspire his troops it can result in the unit fl eeing from combat.

In such situations where there are casualties or a failure to command causes low morale, Vargr players should roleplay the situation and act accordingly by fl eeing, turning to a new leader or attempting to take command themselves.

To determine the effect on Non-Player Characters, the leader must make a Diffi cult (–2 DM) Charisma roll or risk losing the support of his men. Referees can change the task diffi culty to suit the circumstances
(such as the number of casualties). If the leader fails this check then the men under his command will look to new leadership. On an exceptional failure, the entire unit will fl ee the battlefi eld unless a new leader takes command and rallies the troops.

#### CORSAIR BANDS

When most people think of the Vargr, the fi rst thing that comes to mind is the corsair bands that operate throughout the Extents and along the Imperial borders. Indeed, this imagery comes foremost to many Vargr as well but whereas humans see pirates raiding free traders and merchant ships, the Vargr are more likely to see glamour and prestige.

Although the life of a corsair is appealing to the Vargr mentality, these space pirates only constitute less than 10% of Vargr

society. Unfortunately all Vargr have been tarred with the same brush even though the corsairs are hated and feared by many Vargr that have chosen a more honest way of life.

Corsair raiders do not abide by any laws, nor do they recognize boundaries. This is made possible by the fractured governments and lack of centralised policing within the Vargr Extents. Without coordinated law enforcement, corsairs are free to prey on the trade routes with little opposition. When they do encounter resistance they can avoid any legal issues by simply crossing a border.

Outside of Vargr space corsair bands have a much tougher situation as most other races have dedicated law enforcement and military patrols to prevent such acts of piracy. Imperial law ensures that such criminals cannot escape justice by simply crossing the border into other territories. These diffi culties mean that only the largest and most experienced bands prey on ships beyond the Extents.

A number of larger corsair bands have become so powerful and organised that they rival the might of some governments. It is not uncommon for groups of such renown to be hired as mercenaries to bolster the defences of smaller governments or work alongside smaller military forces. Many of these large corsair bands also have their own bases.

Smaller bands also exist, right down to single-ship crews. These independent raiders focus their efforts on the smaller and weaker vessels that are ignored by the larger corsair bands. These targets are also safer for small raider packs as there is little threat of reprisal by the larger bands who operate in that territory.

The diversity of scale of corsair bands, from independent ships to fl eets carrying support troops, reduces much of the confl ict and infi ghting that one would expect from these raiders. However, some rivalries do exist, especially when there is competition for territory and the victims to be looted within.

The larger corsair bands operate much like military groups but with one signifi cant advantage. A corsair band will usually have a strong leader who is both charismatic and skilled, whereas military leaders obtain the position by their popularity but often lack the skills and tactical knowledge that comes with experience. This results in the usual Vargr struggle for dominance amongst military units, whilst corsair leaders have proven themselves time and again making their pack more stable. In fact, most outsiders have diffi culty understanding how a group of pirates can have a more solid hierarchy than any other type of Vargr pack.

#### THE VARGR EXTENTS

The Vargr Extents comprises of approximately 33 sectors coreward of the Spinward Marches and the Imperium. The tendency of the Vargr to move when situations are not to their liking resulted in the rapid expansion and settling of the regions that now make up the Extents.

Cultural Regions The diversity and constant fl ux of loyalties among the Vargr has resulted in a variety of cultures that have spread across the Extents. Based on similarities in language, culture and physiology, the Extents are divided into seven primary cultural regions. However, such boundaries are not easily applied to Vargr space; not only do the borders continually shift but where one region neighbor's another, there tends to be a secondary region between them where the two cultures mix together.

It is also important to note that the following are rough classifi cations and within each cultural group there is the usual diversity found in all aspects of Vargr life.

Logaksu: This region surrounds the Vargr homeworld and surrounding subsectors. Most of this region was established when the Vargr fi rst left Lair to settle on other worlds. Logaksu is more stable than other Vargr regions and although the governments change, they tend to keep the same rules, regulations and borders. Likewise, businesses rise and fall but the trading lanes remain the same; their established routes are the safest and quickest way to travel between worlds.

Gvegh: The spinward region of the Extents largely comprises of the Gvegh culture. The Vargr were fi rst drawn here for the opportunities provided by the Zhodani Consulate.

Due to the proximity with the Zhodani, there are more trained Vargr psionics in this region than anywhere else in the Extents, and psionic institutes are more commonplace along the Zhodani border.

The Gvegh region prospers in many ways but it is also the most politically volatile area in the Extents. The governments here tend to have a large sphere of infl uence but they rise and fall with alarming regularity. The consequence of this political unrest is a region of constant disputes, shifting boundaries, border skirmishes and wars.

This way of life also manifests on a smaller scale. Vargr individuals in the Gvegh region tend to be more impulsive than other Vargr and easily dissatisfi ed when situations are not to their liking.

Aekhu: Aekhu is a small region located coreward of Deneb sector along the Imperial border. Just as some Vargr were

attracted towards Gvegh by the Zhodani, others were drawn to Aekhu by their interest in the Imperium. Although this region is small, its cultural infl uence has expanded and mixed with both Gvegh and Logaksu cultures forming two secondary regions spinward and trailing respectively. These secondary regions are both larger than the Aekhu region itself.

The attitudes of Vargr in this region are amongst the most diverse in the Extents, especially where religion, ethics and patriotism are concerned. Opinions are so often contrasting and opposed that changes in this region are more frequent and extreme than any other Vargr culture.

The contrasting viewpoints and beliefs of this culture give a much greater importance to the family than any other pack. Aekhu Vargr often remain in regular contact with their siblings and it is not uncommon for them to live or work together, especially if they are litter-mates.

Urzaeng: The Urzaeng region lies trailing of the Logaksu region and coreward of the Windhorn Rift. This region was primarily settled by the Urzaeng subspecies (see page 32) and their propensity for violence and attitude towards the weak soon spread to other Vargr subspecies who settled here; the elderly and the sick tend to be moved to separate settlements and left to survive on their own in slum-like communities.

Vargr of the Urzaeng region are known to be territorial and require more personal space than other Vargr. Urzaeng rarely share accommodation, even with members of their pack.

Between the regions of Urzaeng and Logaksu is a secondary region that has a mix of these two cultures.

Ovaghoun: Ovaghoun is located trailing of the Aekhu region and rimward of the Windhorn Rift. The Vargr took much of this region from the Imperium and a strong human presence has remained. Rather than displacing the existing population, the Vargr formed small but densely populated communities around the larger human settlements that already existed.

The human infl uence has had a signifi cant impact on the Ovaghoun who have embraced much of the human culture and blended it with their own. This merging of cultures has helped make Ovaghoun a politically stable region with well established and enduring governments.

However, there is also an undercurrent of resentment against the human population. In many areas, humans own more of the land and run more of the businesses than the Vargr population. This does not sit well with most Vargr, especially when humans take high ranking or political positions that, from a Vargr perspective, imply that those humans have more Charisma than the Vargr.

This hybrid culture of human and Vargr values has expanded both spinward and trailing, forming two secondary regions with Logaksu and Irilitok respectively.

Suedzuk: This region is also known as the Vargr Enclaves and covers most of the coreward and trailing edges of the Extents. The Enclaves are not heavily populated and the Vargr here mostly comprise of outcast subspecies and the descendants of those displaced from Mendan and Gashikan during the Sack of Gashikan (see page 51 for details).

Governments here are few and most areas remain largely ungoverned, with small settlements scattered throughout the region. Many communities prefer to remain isolated and rarely get involved with affairs beyond their immediate environment.

Humans from Mendan and Gashikan refer to the Vargr here as 'the Red Vargr'. This name is given not just for their reddish fur but because of the bloodshed caused during the Sack of Gashikan. Other humans share their contempt for the Suedzuk, as do some Vargr.

Suedzuk packs tend to be small but enduring. New members only join as needed or through the recommendation of others. Much like the Aekhu, siblings of the Suedzuk culture will often maintain close ties with each other.

Irilitok: The Irilitok region is located at the rimward trailing corner of the Extents. Due to the anti-Vargr sentiments that resulted from the Sack of Gashikan, Irilitok remained free of Vargr settlers for centuries.

Around the year –1,000 many Vargr were forced into slavery by humans, who selected Vargr with the most 'human-like' appearance; those who had shorter muzzles and stood more erect. On some worlds the Vargr were left unchecked and the slave population rapidly grew to be the most prominent species. During this period, other Vargr packs moved to the region to further increase the Vargr population.

The Vargr population growth resulted in humans taking a more favorable view toward their Vargr neighbors and it was not long before racial attitudes relaxed. The presence of the human owned Menderes Corporation also helped in this regard as they fostered human-Vargr relations. Although the human and Vargr communities tend to be separate, there is a strong degree of racial acceptance and cooperation. On some worlds there is much less segregation and a greater blending of the two cultures.

Humans are much more inclined to deal with the Irilitok than any other Vargr culture and likewise, the Vargr here are more understanding of human customs.

#### HUMANS IN THE VARGR EXTENTS

There are a number of human worlds and settlements in the Extents, most of which lie along the border of Imperial space. Many of these border worlds were once part of the Imperium but were taken by the Vargr during Vargr Pillaging (–2,400 to
–1,700).

Vargr attitudes toward humans vary from place to place and some typical human-Vargr interactions within the Extents are given here. On most worlds humans and Vargr communities are segregated but both races live in relative peace, whilst on others there is open hostility between the two cultures. In some locations human and Vargr co-exist in mixed race communities, yet slavery is known to be practiced by both races.

Humans and other races visit the Vargr Extents. Many governments and worlds along the border enjoy trade agreements with independent merchants, corporations and Imperial organizations. Imperial citizens also journey to Vargr space for a variety of other reasons including adventure, diplomatic duties, exploration, jobs, research and even mercenary work.

Due to the nature of Vargr society and turbulent politics in the Extents, the Traveller's Aid Society classifi es most Vargr worlds as Amber Zones unless proven to be safe. Worlds known to be hazardous are classifi ed as Red Zones as usual. However, the status of Vargr worlds are prone to change so Imperial classifi cations are not necessarily correct.

#### VARGR IN THE IMPERIUM

Very few worlds in the Imperium are populated entirely by Vargr but there are numerous Vargr scattered throughout Imperial space. Settlements with a signifi cant Vargr population usually have a Vargr quarter where most of them live and socialise. Such areas tend to be loud and colourful with an atmosphere much like any other Vargr community.

Vargr in the Imperium behave much as they do in the Extents. They still lack respect for authority but will follow a charismatic human leader just as they would a Vargr. However, the usual jockeying for Charisma and power is not so prevalent as such behaviour tends not to be so benefi cial in human culture and rarely results in promotion.

Vargr also discover that laws are enforced more strongly in the Imperium and although the Vargr disrespect for the law remains they become more mindful of it, learning what they can get away with and what they get arrested for. This is often a case of trial and error and most Vargr who travel to Imperial space will be charged with at least one misdemeanour before taking a more active view of the law.

#### LANGUAGE & NAMING

The diversity of Vargr society extends to their language. There are hundreds of different languages and dialects spoken throughout the Extents. Governments tend to favor a particular language but this is not always the case and in some regions a common language is adopted to aid in trade and negotiations.

Vargr usually choose their own name when they come of age. Some choose a name that is signifi cant to them such as an important event or achievement in their life whilst other Vargr names are chosen arbitrarily and do not necessarily have any meaning.

Vargr Language The most common Vargr language in the Spinward Marches and Gvurrdon sector is Gvegh, which is spoken by roughly 60% of Vargr in those sectors and is also used frequently throughout the Gvegh and neighboring regions.

Vargr language is also spoken differently by different people depending on their Charisma. Individuals with a low Charisma tend to be more grammatical and those with a higher Charisma speak in a more informal manner forcing the listener to pay close attention to what is being said and show respect to their superior.

This is an important concept of the Vargr language as it conveys an individual's Charisma in addition to the meaning of what they are communicating. It is also important to note that very few Vargr are able to fake this aspect of language and to even try would be disrespectful and probably result in the loss of Charisma.

High Charisma characters also draw out their words and sentences to display their dominance over the listener. However if they exaggerate their speech too much a listener may interrupt, gaining respect for doing so at the expense of the speaker.

There is a very fi ne line of when such an interruption will be benefi cial or seen as impudence on the part of the interrupter.

Non-Verbal Communication Like other races, body language plays in important role in Vargr communication. However, Vargr have a limited range of facial expressions so they use their posture, bearing, ears and tails to convey unspoken meaning to their communications.

Much of a Vargr's body language is subconscious and can often give a clear indication as to their emotional state. This can obviously make Vargr quite vulnerable so they will often use additional gestures to distract others from seeing such strong emotional signals.

Generating Vargr Words Words in Vargr, like English, have defi nite letter frequencies and syllable patterns that are independent of information content; it is possible to randomly generate words that look and sound Vargr. Words are constructed from syllables, which are in turn composed of up to three elements: an initial consonant, a vowel and a fi nal consonant.

The Vargr language has four syllable types: those consisting of just a single vowel (V), those beginning with a consonant (CV), those ending with a consonant (VC) and those that begin and end with a consonant (CVC). The ratio that these four types of syllable occur in Vargr words is about 1:3:3:3 (V:CV:VC:CVC).

In addition to these basic rules for constructing words, it is important to note that syllables that end in a vowel cannot be followed by a syllable that begins with a vowel.

The Vargr Sound Frequency table shows the relative frequencies to be expected for each sound of the Vargr language. For example, the relative frequency of D as an initial consonant is 5:115.

#### VARGR PROVERBS

Some of the common Vargr proverbs also give an insight into the Vargr mindset and society.

'Aekh kfaegzoukhin zersakha Vargr; kfaegzoukhin zersakh kuvargr.'
'A Vargr without charisma is no better than a rock; a rock with charisma is better than an entire pack.'

This proverb explains the importance of charisma in Vargr society.

'Ghakse faeng faeng faeng faengeg; dzedzdhougz faeng faeng kufaeng udheg.'
'A pup's ball is the pup's; a pup's teeth are the pack's.'

This proverb portrays both the individuality of the Vargr and the security gained from being loyal to one's pack.

'Ouko zersakha, zersakha rrugon.'
'When a rock falls, it is still a rock.'

Another Vargr saying that uses the rock as a metaphor; the rock is signifi cant here, representing strength of will. The proverb teaches the importance of adversity – a loss of charisma is an opportunity to raise one's standing within the pack.

'Kagzga gaksog rrasngouthin dzungogu, ghuegzakskha rrugon ozu.'
'The pond gathers muck, whilst the river fl ows clear.'

This proverb teaches the virtues of change over stagnation and its importance in Vargr society – a fl owing river constantly renews itself and has the strength to forge its own path but a pond eventually stagnates and leads nowhere.

'Thursuth gha kvaehh.'
'Where death is not allowed to go.'

This is a common response to an abundance of rules and regulations. It means that most events cannot simply be prevented by rules alone. This proverb also infers a minor threat or warning.

'Khofaeghorz gvegh gvegh gnaedh faeng Vargr rrirrg.'
'Vargr speech without teeth.'

This is a commonly used insult directed at people who cannot back up what they have said.

## HHIISTORYSTORY

As one would expect from the Vargr, their history is full of inaccuracies, contradictions and incomplete accounts. Each pack and government has its own version of events that have been modifi ed and embellished through the years. The fall of a government would often result in the loss of historical records or the rewriting of events by rival groups and charismatic individuals.

The vast number of factions that have existed throughout Vargr history has made it virtually impossible to record an accurate account even by Vargr historians. Imperial historians have had an even more diffi cult task, not only due to their lack of understanding of Vargr society but because what historical records do exist are often denied to non-Vargr for reasons of racial pride and self-interest.

Due to the number of Vargr calendars that exist and have existed throughout Vargr history, the Imperial calendar is used here to record the history of the Vargr.

#### SERVANTS OF THE ANCIENTS

It has become generally accepted that the Vargr were seeded on their homeworld (designated 'Lair' by the Imperium) around the year –300,000. The fi rst Vargr bore only a distant resemblance to their modern day successors. Scientifi c evidence indicates that the genetic engineering performed by the Ancients was intended to maximise the potential of the canine race; this allowed the Vargr to evolve more naturally rather than developing to a specifi c result desired by the Ancients.

There have been a number of factions, most notably the Church of the Chosen Ones, who believe and proceeded to prove (somewhat unconvincingly) that Vargr development was guided toward its current form and disposition. Contrary to most evidence, these groups believe that several interventions were made by the Ancients to make the Vargr a 'perfect' race fi t to rule their region of the galaxy. However, most scientifi c evidence suggests that after the initial seeding, no further involvement was made by the Ancients in the Vargr's development.

The idea that the Ancients allowed the Vargr to evolve into their natural potential also suggests that the Ancients took an extremely long view of things if they could watch a race evolve over centuries and even millennia. Experts in Ancient history have placed the fi nal war of the Ancients around the same time as the creation of the Vargr race, which poses the question – would the Ancients have intervened further had they remained to watch over their creations?

Whatever design the Ancients had for the Vargr race, most scholars agree that the Vargr were developed to be a servant race. The loyalty inherent to the canine species strongly suggests that this was a trait the Ancients wished to exploit and one of the reasons it has remained such a driving force behind the Vargr mindset.

#### PRE-CIVILISATION

Some scholars postulate that the Vargr were seeded on several continents but there is little proof of this. Recent studies have shown that Aerueko Fen is the most likely continent of origin.

Once the Vargr had been transplanted onto Lair their development was chaotic, foreshadowing the ultimate outcome of their society. Their natural instinct to form packs determined the Vargr lifestyle and has remained a focus of their society ever since. Early Vargr packs were primarily centered on the family unit with the males responsible for hunting whilst the females nurtured their young.

Competition was fi erce during these times with rival packs fi ghting over prime hunting grounds. Family packs were forced to unite against rival factions and the basis of the modern day social structure began to form. Authority came directly from the pack leader with the most charisma but the overall pack size was limited to the number of individuals the leader was able to infl uence; even during this period of Vargr evolution they were unable to accept authority from individuals outside their immediate environment.

As these early Vargr grew accustomed to the conditions on Lair, they adapted both physically and psychologically in order to survive the alien environment. This gives further credence to the idea that the Ancients granted the ability for Vargr to readily adapt to their surroundings as a means for survival.

This period lasted approximately 250,000 years, during which time the Vargr race had developed signifi cantly. However, the constant confl ict with rival packs meant that the Vargr grew at a slow rate and exploration was limited to meeting the needs of the pack.

#### EARLY CIVILISATION

As the early nomadic hunting packs evolved and developed, so did their knowledge and understanding. As early concepts of farming and breeding animals became popular, permanent settlements started to appear around the year –50,000, marking the beginning of Vargr civilization.

As these new settlements grew, more complex societies evolved and soon the fi rst governments were formed. Typically these would have infl uence over a single settlement and in some cases several neighboring settlements. The lack of respect for remote authority still reigned and large governments soon lost control to be replaced with smaller factions. The need for charismatic leadership also evolved from the early days of small packs and the Vargr political climate became as turbulent as it is today.

This period of Vargr history has often been likened to the Classical Greek period on Earth with numerous city-states and small governments each vying for power. So independent were these early factions that they would only unite in the face of extreme adversity, and even then such alliances would be fl eeting.

There were occasions where a particularly charismatic individual would successfully unite neighboring factions but even with strong leadership and infl uence these unions were short lived. Only a few individuals such as Erzikh Dhadh were able to sustain an alliance but even those fractured after the leader's passing.

Advances in technology allowed for larger nations by exposing the people to leaders in more distant locations. Communication became a key element in maintaining and expanding a

government's sphere of infl uence. However, these Vargr nations were not comparable to human states – individuals and groups within a government's sphere of infl uence would often (and still do) act without government sanction.

The size of a state was largely determined by the speed, range and effectiveness of the communication technology. The birth of radio, television and other means to broadcast messages saw a rapid expansion in the size and number of nations. These new instant forms of communication also increased the rate that governments and individuals changed their allegiance, causing governments to rise and fall much more frequently. Long range communications also advanced Vargr military divisions, further aiding governments to control larger regions.

#### RACE FOR THE STARS

In –4089 the fi rst unmanned satellite was successfully launched into Lair's orbit. This pivotal event was the catalyst for the Vargr space race, which had every nation of the time dedicated to be the fi rst to launch a manned mission, then to be fi rst to the moons, then neighboring planets and so on as the competition gathered pace.

The status gained with each breakthrough in space travel brought with it respect and charisma to those responsible, and by proxy, to the leaders who supported and encouraged the research and development of the technologies. With each advance in space technology there was a huge shift in power as the government responsible would win over new supporters, gaining loyal citizens. With so much depending on each success this was a turbulent time that saw a number of hostilities between rival nations.

Within a hundred years the nation of Arrdzafodh had established the fi rst Vargr colony on the world of Erzikh Dhadh, named after the legendary prince. Shortly after this a second colony was established on the planet Foulours. For over a hundred years, interest in colonization waned and only a few other colonies were established on neighboring moons and worlds.

In –3815 the colonies on Erzikh Dhadh and Foulours declared independence, triggering the Colonial Rebellion. By this time, these two colonies controlled the majority of Arrdzafodh's spacecraft. In an effort to regain control and dominance over the colonies, Arrdzafodh began researching new technologies and methods of space travel that led to the discovery of the jump drive in –3810.

With the discovery of the jump drive, interest in space travel increased once more and within two decades every government on Lair had jump-capable ships. Arrdzafodh now had superior propulsion and in –3790 their navy destroyed the settlement on Erzikh Dhadh, ending the Colonial Rebellion.

#### THE STELLAR ERA

Vargr jump drives were initially used for small jumps within the Lair system but scientists soon realised the potential of this technology and were able to jump to nearby star systems. Once this discovery had been made and habitable worlds were found in other systems, Vargr from all nations rushed to explore the stars and the Vargr Diaspora began with an exodus of packs from Lair.

When Vargr are unsatisfi ed with their lives or environment, it is their natural instinct to either change the leadership or move on. It was this latter tendency and the availability of jump-capable ships that made the Diaspora such a huge event that lasted over a thousand years.

Early settlements were small and thinly spread throughout Provence and surrounding sectors. Some explorers made it further afi eld but the majority were established around Provence sector. Most colony worlds imitated the history of Lair and even as each settlement became more established the rise and fall of nations continued at a traditional Vargr rate. Many of the early leaders were simply not charismatic enough to maintain their leadership over such time and distance.

As the Vargr spread throughout the region, the political issues that once played out on a single continent or world were now mirrored on much larger scale; the concept of a true interstellar state seems beyond the natural traits of the Vargr.

Even with political fl uctuations at the stellar level, trade routes were established (although these were also prone to the same changes) and commerce fl ourished. The riches found on many worlds helped to establish a number of governments and corporations by boosting their planetary economy.

The Diaspora started to decline around –2500 when much of what is now the spinward half of the Extents had been explored and colonized. With the boom of interstellar trade and so many lucrative markets to exploit, space travel was now focussed on trade rather than exploration.

The Windhorn Rift The Vargr expansion came to a halt in the trailing direction as explorers discovered the Windhorn Rift. This vast area crosses four sectors and the distance between the few systems in this region make jump travel virtually impossible. Many Vargr tried to cross the Rift but the jump technology at this time was limited and each expedition was doomed to failure.

Many scholars and historians argue that the barrier of the Windhorn Rift actually acted in the Vargr's favor, for beyond the Rift lay the Ziru Sirka, the Vilani Grand Empire of the Stars. During this time the First Imperium was at the peak of the

Consolidation Wars; a series of campaigns designed to ensure that no independent society on the Ziru Sirka borders had jump drive technology and thereby monopolising the Vilani's control over interstellar travel. Had these races met at this time, the Vilani would have attempted, and perhaps succeeded, to subjugate the Vargr race.

For nearly a hundred years after the Diaspora decline the Windhorn Rift segregated the Vargr from the Vilani but explorers were eventually able to navigate around the Rift. Fortunately, by the time the Vargr had crossed the Ziru Sirka borders the First Imperium had begun to decline.

Vargr Pillaging The decline of the Vilani Empire led many of their provincial governors to hire the so-called 'barbarians' and mercenaries at their borders. The most notable of these governors was Tazzik Kuluunaddar who controlled a region spanning Corridor and Provence sectors. Many human and Vargr historians agree that Tazzik was the fi rst human to have dealt with the Vargr after corsair raiders attacked outposts and ships in his territory.

Tazzik Kuluunaddar supplied a large corsair band called Infaerrgeng with weapons and equipment to strengthen his forces and increase his power in the Ziru Sirka. Kuluunaddar failed to gain the power he wanted and the Infaerrgeng were now aware of the riches ready for the taking in this weakened empire and began to plunder the Vilani border worlds.

This one event opened the fl oodgates throughout the rimward and trailing regions of the Vargr Extents and by the year –2400 countless Vargr were raiding human worlds. This became known as the Vargr Pillaging as opportunists travelled rimward and coreward around the Windhorn Rift to make their fortunes.

The decedent Vilani Empire did not have the strength to defend against the constant raids, which only encouraged more Vargr to join their brethren. Corsair bands sold their loot on the Ziru Sirka black market and this became so profi table that the Vargr did not even consider trading with their human neighbors.

The Pillaging also heralded the dawn of the Second Vargr Diaspora. As the corsair bands raided new worlds, new settlements formed and grew. The usual jockeying for power in the newly formed Vargr colonies led to the formation of new corsair bands, further expanding the Vargr presence in Vilani space. The Pillaging continued for seven centuries, during which time the Second Imperium was founded in –2204.

During this period, much of the Ovaghoun region was established as rich Imperial worlds were taken by the Vargr. Although many Vargr settlements were established, the Vilani were not completely displaced and many worlds in this region still have human communities to this day.

Many Vargr historians proclaim that the Vargr Pillaging was largely responsible for the downfall of the First Imperium. However, although human scholars acknowledge that the Vargr incursions were certainly a factor, they disagree on the extent of the Vargr's contribution to the Ziru Sirka's collapse.

The Gvegh Wars Shortly before the decline of the Second Diaspora, two new powers were emerging in Gvurrdon sector, the Zaegou Federation and Raso Gatsdzo. Perceiving these two expanding empires as a threat, a number of the smaller governments formed the Uthe Alliance. Other small alliances also formed along the borders of the Zaegou Federation and Raso Gatsdzo empires. Hostilities along these borders were inevitable and a combination of border skirmishes and corsair raids soon led to a full scale war in –1760 with the two large empires fi ghting multiple enemies of varying military might.

With so many battles being fought, it was not long before independent corsair bands took advantage of the opportunity, raiding supply lines and border worlds of the warring nations. Retaliation came swift and hard but directed at the wrong targets. Smaller nations then attacked their weakened rivals who had taken collateral damage and new wars erupted between minor states.

For over a century separate wars broke out, ravaging the entire sector and eventually spilling into neighboring sectors within the Gvegh region. During this time the Zaegou Federation and Raso Gatsdzo had both suffered heavy losses due to fi ghting a war on so many fronts. Both empires had also made the mistake of focussing their attacks at each other so the smaller alliances had taken few casualties in comparison.

The allied nations that remained took advantage of the weakened empires and soon destroyed them both. With the end of these once mighty nations, peace began to return to the region and by
–1620 the Gvegh Wars had come to an end.

All of the alliances that had formed to fi ght the larger empires fell apart and there were few states in the sector that controlled more than a single system. Once again there was a vacuum of power in Gvurrdon sector but since most worlds were recovering from the wars, none had the strength to take up the mantle.

This quiet and peaceful period continued for nearly 50 years while each government tended to its wounds and rebuilt their worlds. The wars were still recent history and the Vargr were reluctant to repeat such bloody acts. Inevitably though, the Vargr returned to the old ways and larger governments eventually formed but the region was still unstable and few lasted long – quite often neighboring states would temporarily ally themselves to prevent any larger power establishing itself in the sector.

The Sack of Gashikan During the Pillaging, the Vargr had established settlements on many new worlds in the sectors of Antares, Menden, Amdukan and Gashikan. The continued corsair raids were met by both fear and respect amongst the human populations but a strong naval presence by the Solomani helped put an end to most anti-Vargr sentiment and helped to quell much of the raiding by Vargr corsairs.

The Solomani became the dominant power in the region and Vargr became accepted into their society. In Gashikan sector the Vargr were used to help stabilize and grow the colonies. However, these Vargr were generally treated as an underclass, given hostile worlds to manage while human settlements were established in better climates with greater resources.

In –1666 the worlds of Gashikan declared their independence and established the Empire of Gashikan. Vargr worlds were granted equal status but in reality most were controlled by uncharismatic leaders. The rules and regulations imposed by the new government made life diffi cult for the Vargr and many lived in poverty.

In the year –1658, the Gashikan Vargr rebelled against their oppressors. They hired corsair bands as protection but unfortunately this plan backfi red; the civilian leaders were soon replaced by the more charismatic corsair leaders who allied themselves to further their own agendas.

The corsair bands disrupted the relative peace by raiding human ships and colonies. The humans soon retaliated and the corsairs fl ed the region leaving the Vargr worlds defenceless; without strong leadership the Vargr were unprepared to fi ght the superior human forces.

As the Vargr settlers fought for their survival, the corsairs returned. Toward the end of –1658 the corsairs launched an attack on the planet of Gashikan, neutralising the navy and using the human vessels to attack the Vargr colonies. With Gashikan now defenceless, the corsairs used nuclear weapons to destroy the remaining defences and proceeded to pillage the helpless settlements.

Once again the corsairs fl ed and the already weakened Vargr colonies met with terrible reprisals as the humans wreaked their vengeance against the Vargr populations. News of the Sack of Gashikan spread throughout the neighboring sectors, shocking both human and Vargr alike. This catalyst sparked a strong hatred between the Vargr and humans of this region that earned the Vargr in Gashikan sector the name Suedzuk, meaning 'Red Vargr'; a name that refers to both the colour of their fur and the bloodshed they were responsible for.

The human survivors of Gashikan eventually rebuilt their cities and used the ongoing confl ict to establish themselves as the leaders of the Second Empire of Gashikan. The worlds of Gashikan and Mendan sectors began to unite against the Vargr and proceeded to destroy all Vargr settlements within their reach.

The Vargr colonies were fi ghting a losing battle and still lacked any charismatic leaders to win a victory against the humans. Those that were able fl ed the region, with many settling in the region now known as the Vargr Enclaves where they lived in isolation for many centuries until the dawn of the Third Imperium.

Slaves and Masters The Sack of Gashikan left a bitter taste in the mouth of humanity, and these ill feelings lasted for centuries. In the Irilitok region, around the year –1000, many Vargr were forced into slavery by human oppressors who still dominated much of the region.

The new human masters selected Vargr who were more 'human- like' in appearance; those who had shorter muzzles and stood more erect. On some worlds the Vargr slave populations were left unchecked and they rapidly grew to dominate those planets. During this period, Vargr packs began immigrating to this region, which further increased the Vargr population and strengthened their control over those worlds.

A New Dawn Although the Vargr living in human dominated space continued to suffer throughout the Long Night of humaniti, the Vargr populations continued to grow. Well established Vargr worlds bordered human space and many Vargr settlements still remained on the human dominated worlds. Although some of these Vargr communities were ignored by the humans, many suffered at the hands of the human populations.

At the dawn of the Third Imperium, Solomani scientists began to theorize that Vargr were [[Terra|Terran]] canines uplifted by the Ancients. This became known as the Solomani Hypothesis, which led many humans to regard the Vargr as freaks or dangerous animals. However, in Amdukan sector many humans were more accepting of the Vargr's heritage and the anti-Vargr attitudes began to relax.

Amdukan sector was dominated by the Menderes Corporation who encouraged the Vargr to immigrate. To begin with, this enthusiasm by the corporation was not out of understanding or sympathy for the Vargr but as a means for cheap labour. However, under the guidance of charismatic leaders it soon became apparent that not only were the Vargr good workers but cooperation was much better for commerce and the local economy. With this revelation, the Menderes Corporation began a campaign to reduce anti-Vargr sentiments and worked to better integrate them into human society.

As the Third Imperium continued to expand its leaders became interested in the coreward region and in the year 89 Emperor Artemsus began the Imperial Antares Pacifi cation Campaign. Those who were able to leave the region did so and had strong anti-Imperium views, which included the mistreatment of the Vargr – many Vargr worlds were seized under the guise of returning them to Vilani nobles.

The Julian Wars Not wanting the Imperium to interfere with their plans and seeing the growing empire as an economic threat, the charismatic Menderes family publicised racial issues and openly criticized the Imperial propaganda. This caused many problems for Imperial diplomats and fuelled anti-Imperium sentiments, which ultimately resulted in the Julian Wars in 175.

The Imperium was not prepared to face such a strong alliance of worlds and confederations, including the Vargr who fought alongside their new charismatic leaders armed with weapons supplied by their human allies. Julian Menderes soon rose in power and gained much charisma in the eyes of humans and Vargr alike and in 178 he became the regent.

Julian Menderes' new found charisma and vast fi nancial resources were able to win over many new allies and formed the Julian Protectorate in 191. This act culminated in victory against the Imperium later that year. The atrocities of the Sack of Gashikan began to fade and a new era of Vargr-human relations was born. The prosperity and mutual understanding of these once warring peoples is still enjoyed today in this region.

Vargr Campaigns Following shortly after the Julian Wars was a period of hostilities known as the Vargr Campaigns (220 to 348). As the Imperium expanded, its borders eventually clashed with numerous Vargr states that had been established in Vland, Corridor, and Deneb sectors. Confl ict was inevitable and resulted in a series of wars, confl icts and disputes that are collectively referred to as the Vargr Campaigns.

The Vargr lost control of many worlds during the Campaigns and once the Imperium had secured its territories, they made efforts to discourage further Vargr settlement into the Spinward Marches, Deneb, Corridor and Vland sectors.

The Frontier Wars Imperial attitudes towards the Vargr were gradually improving but took a severe blow when the First Frontier War began in

589. The war erupted between the Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate. By this time the Zhodani had built up a good relationship with several of the neighboring Vargr governments in Gvurrdon sector and rallied them to fi ght against the Imperium, forming the Outworld Coalition.

The fi ghting lasted for 15 years with the Coalition launching numerous raids deep into Imperial territory within the Spinward

Governments of Provence Sector The most prominent governments throughout Vargr history are listed below. They show the diversity of governments that can be found in just one sector and give an overview of some typical Vargr states.

Dzarrgh Federate: Established in 1090, the Dzarrgh Federate now spans the border between Provence and Tuglikki sectors. Many of the worlds were independent states since the fall of the Foergaz Coalition in –2530 and initially resisted joining the Federate but the benefi ts and power of the expanding government eventually changed their minds.

The Dzarrgh Federate exercises little control over its member worlds, allowing a great deal of autonomy. Currency and law are handled at a local level and taxes for member worlds are reasonable in return for the protection granted by the military. Piracy is even sanctioned in Imperial territory and is practiced by both the corsair bands and the navy.

Personal freedoms are not restricted by the Dzarrgh Federate so cultures and customs are many and varied. With such a relaxed control over its member worlds, it is sometimes diffi cult to know exactly where the state borders end and where independence begins.

Empire of Varroerth: Many within the Empire of Varroerth claim that their government was founded in the early days of Vargr space travel but evidence shows that the fi rst Emperor took power in the year 26, which still makes the Empire of Varroerth the oldest government currently active in the Extents.

The Empire was established in Ngathksirz sector and expanded into the surrounding sectors, including the coreward subsectors of Provence. The Empire grew to such a size that the emperor became little more than a fi gurehead and the real power was in the hands of the 20 regional governors. With their infl uence restricted the emperors that succeeded Varroerth had little charisma, which ultimately led to Lair declaring independence in 777 and taking several neighboring worlds with it.

In addition to the governors, a number of corsair bands also control a signifi cant portion of the military, economic and political power. Confl ict between any of the governors and corsairs is a common occurrence. Independent groups are often drawn into these disputes and many form their own states or declare independence, but remain under the control or have some affi liation with the larger powers.

Glory of Taarskoerzn: This government was formed in 869 by a coalition of seven worlds bordering the Windhorn Rift. A period of unrest in the late 900s led to a militant faction within the government seizing power. Infl uenced by the Church of the Chosen Ones, this new government proceeded to expand their sphere of infl uence and conquered a number of neighboring systems.

Irrgh Manifest: Established in the early 400s, the Irrgh Manifest is one of the largest governments in the Extents covering much of the rimward region of Provence sector. The Irrgh Manifest territories border much of the Glory of Taarskoerzn and they have become fi erce rivals. Border skirmishes are common between these two governments and hostilities continue to rise.

Lair Protectorate: When Lair declared independence from the Empire of Varroerth in 777, Lair formed an alliance with fi ve neighboring worlds and established the Lair Protectorate. These were among the fi rst worlds settled by the Vargr and their strong traditions of independence coupled with the ideology of the Protectorate was much more appealing than that of the Empire of Varroerth. Since its inception, three more worlds have joined the Lair Protectorate making a total of nine.

Members of the Protectorate enjoy liberties that are at the very core of what it is to be Vargr. Society is based on charisma and change; leaders, businesses, laws and even customs are in a constant state of fl ux. The Lair Protectorate has a sizable and high-tech military force, which they use to maintain their way of life and protect their members from opposing governments and rival factions.

Marches, something that the Vargr were particularly skilled at. The confl ict ultimately ended in a stalemate and new borders were drawn between the Zhodani and Imperium but this armistice did not directly affect the Vargr.

The First Frontier War had weakened the Imperium and in 615 the Zhodani and Vargr reformed the Outworld Coalition, marking the beginning of the Second Frontier War. The Coalition struck deeper into Jewell subsector but the Imperium fought a holding action for fi ve years whilst new shipyards were being constructed. Once the Imperium's new ships rolled out of the shipyards they brought the war to an end, resulting in another stalemate where more worlds were ceded to the Zhodani.

Although most of the Vargr involved in the Frontier Wars fought alongside the Zhodani, several of the smaller states sided with the Imperium. A number of Vargr corsair bands also joined the fi ght on both sides.

In recent years, Vargr relations with other races have improved considerably. Much progress has been made with the Imperium and other races have also taken a more positive view of the Vargr. Unfortunately there are still corsair raids and border incidents with neighboring territories, and the descendants of the Suedzuk still remain in isolation in the Vargr Enclaves; such is the way of the Vargr that they will be encountered in all their diverse forms.

## EEQQUIPMENTUIPMENT

Vargr equipment is, for the most part, similar in form and function to human items. The main differences are found in clothing and armor where the physiological differences of the Vargr infl uence the design. Although clothing and armor from other races can be modifi ed to fi t a Vargr, they prefer to have specifi cally made items that are more comfortable. Likewise, other races fi nd most Vargr clothing uncomfortable to wear.

A large amount of Vargr equipment is second hand. There is no status attached to buying new or second hand; the abundance of second hand goods from failed companies is simply part of Vargr life that creates a buyer's market. Junk dealers (see page 38) usually trade out of a warehouse bulk selling to corporations but most have an open door policy allowing anyone to browse their stock and purchase goods as required. For those looking to bulk buy second hand merchandise, fi nding an experienced scrounger (see page 39) can save the buyer a lot of money.

There is less of a second hand market for personal and domestic items such as clothes and house wares since these items are less likely to become redundant when companies fail. However, this market is still big by human standards and second hand shops that cater to the domestic market are a common sight in any Vargr settlement, ranging from small independent retailers to large megastores.

Currency Like all things Vargr, currency varies from place to place. Most governments will try to instigate their own single currency but the rate of success varies with the culture and government's sphere of infl uence; the further a world is from the center of government the less inclined its people are to follow the government's edicts.

Most Vargr worlds will accept currency from neighboring regions where the value of the currency is known and it is practical to do so. Other currencies will also be accepted if they have a tangible value or if trade agreements have been established.

Imperial Credits are accepted on many Vargr worlds that are close to the Imperial border. However, regions further within the Extents are less likely to recognize Imperial currency or have use for it.

Purchasing Equipment Due to the rapid rise and fall of Vargr businesses, the local economy of each government and world fl uctuates wildly. Prices vary from place to place by as much as 30%. When purchasing equipment and services, Referees should alter the costs by
±15% by adding 2d6–7 x 3 percent to the list price.

Characters wishing to purchase second hand items can go direct to a junk dealer or hire the services of a scrounger. Buying direct from a second hand store or junk dealer will reduce the list cost by up to 40%, which is determined by subtracting 5d6+10 percent from the modifi ed list price. It is entirely possible that brand new goods on one Vargr world are cheaper than buying the same items second hand on a different world.

A scrounger will typically fi nd the required items with a further 2d6 percent price reduction but will take a commission of 1d6 percent of the total cost of goods purchased. For exotic, illegal or rare items, Referees may want to make a Computers and/or Broker roll for the scrounger to fi nd the required goods.

#### ARMOR

Armor is a common sight in the Vargr Extents and is not just worn by corsairs or members of the military. The high risk of attack by pirates means that many traders and travellers also don some form of protection when they pass through dangerous regions and undefended space routes.

Vargr tend not to use full body suits. Instead they use separate pieces of armor that they buy, steal or scavenge to suit their personal needs and comfort. Many Vargr, especially corsairs, have a mismatch of armor in a variety of materials, colours and styles. Most components in these armor sets are designed specifi cally for Vargr and most other races fi nd them uncomfortable.

To represent the diversity of Vargr armor it is purchased as a complete set, with combinations of armor pieces providing protection to different parts of the body. Second hand armor is likely to be mismatched as a result of junk dealers piecing together various components to make a set or the original owner simply having different pieces.

Vargr individuals wearing helmets are less able to exert their infl uence and charisma due to a signifi cant amount of facial expressions and body language being concealed under the armor. For this reason, helmets tend only to be part of full armor suits

Armor is as much an expression of a Vargr's personality and achievements as it is for protection. For this reason it is usually customised by each individual with ornamentation and tattoos
(see page 36 for details). This is especially true of corsairs and military personnel.

Kforzonga (Shoulder Guards, TL6/8): Made from fl exible metals and plastic mesh, kforzonga provide full shoulder protection. The TL8 variety is made from interlocking plates of advanced polymers providing the same protection with less mass. Kforzonga are a favorite amongst corsairs and the military who commonly paint tattoos of rank and pack for all to see. Kforzonga are used in many armor sets and suits.

Negdhazuk (Bracers, TL6/8): These vambraces cover the forearms and are constructed from fl exible metals. The TL8 version uses advanced polymers to reduce the mass. Negdhazuk are a popular choice for anyone requiring cheap and effective light armor with space to paint tattoos. Negdhazuk are a component part of many armor sets.

Dhinourraksa (Chest Guard, TL7): The dhinourraksa is a partial chest covering that comes in many designs; common ones include spines, V shape and upper torso coverings. Although the dhinourraksa provides less protection than a breastplate it is less restrictive and much lighter, making it a favorite for Vargr with less strength or a smaller stature. It is also popular with pilots and other military personnel who are less likely to enter personal combat situations. The dhinourraksa is used in numerous armor sets.

Dhinou (Breastplate, TL7): Made from advanced composites, the dhinou is a lightweight breastplate that is commonly used by corsairs and some marine units who require strong protection on the front of their body when they board spacecraft; they have little need for coverage on their back and are less encumbered by the full torso coverage of the dhoukha. Individuals wearing a dhinou often gain respect and trust from their peers as it is an indication that the wearer is less likely to turn tail in combat and expose their unprotected back. The dhinou is used in numerous armor sets.

Dhoukha (Vest, TL7/8): A full torso piece made from advanced composites, consisting of a breastplate and backplate that are joined at the sides. The dhoukha is most commonly used by the Vargr army and mercenaries. The TL8 version is made from advanced polymers. The dhoukha is a component part of numerous armor sets.

Kforzhazuk (Fighter Set, TL6/8): A fi ghter set (two armor components) comprising of shoulder guards and bracers. The kforzhazuk is favored by corsairs who prefer to be lightly armored but like to adorn their armor with sigils. A TL8 version is also available providing the same protection but made from lighter materials.

Kforzgong (Fighter Set, TL8): This fi ghter set combines shoulder guards with knee plates. The bulk added by the armor can give an intimidating appearance making it another favorite of corsair raiders.

Dhinohazuk (Fighter Set, TL7): The dhinohazuk consists of a chest guard and bracers. Although this is the heaviest of the fi ghter armor sets it is less bulky and cumbersome, making it popular with pilots and crew who require minimum armor without reducing their ability to perform their job.

Zurrku-Ekdho (Light Suit, TL7): A light suit (three armor components) comprising of a chest guard, shoulder guards and bracers. Light suits such as this are often used by pilots and crew that have are likely to enter combat situations.

Zurrku-Oengga (Light Suit, TL8): This light suit has a chest guard, shoulder guards and knee plates and is a common alternative to the Zurrku-Ekdho. The knee plates are a similar design to the shoulder guards using interlocking plates made from advanced polymers.

Zurrku-Udhvarr (Light Suit, TL8): A light suit made up of shoulder guards, bracers and knee plates. The Zurrku-Udhvarr differs slightly to other light suits in that it has no torso protection. However, the armor covering on the wrists, shoulders and knees makes it good for melee attacks if the blade enhancement option has been added (see page 57).

Kungedz-Dhagu (Attack Suit, TL8): An attack suit (three or four armor components with chest protection) made up of a chest guard, shoulder guards and gauntlets. The gauntlets are made from interlocking plates of advanced polymers, protecting the hands and forearms.

Kungedz-Verz (Attack Suit, TL7): This attack suit comprises of a chest guard, shoulder guards, bracers and boots. The Kungedz-Verz is one of the few armor sets that includes boots since many Vargr prefer to go without such footwear. Armored boots are usually made from fl exible metals and plastic mesh.

Kungedz-Vaung (Attack Suit, TL8): An attack suit consisting of a chest plate, shoulder guards, bracers and knee plates. This armor set is commonly used by corsairs – once decorated and painted, the Kungedz-Vaung can look quite fearsome in addition to providing good coverage when boarding a ship.

Kungedz-Dhaganou (Attack Suit, TL8): Comprising of a chest plate, shoulder guards, gauntlets and boots, this attack suit is commonly used by corsairs and marines who require a little extra protection than is provided by other attack suits.

Dhoukha-Thuegzinga (Warrior Suit, TL8): A warrior suit
(providing full torso protection) that has an armored vest, bracers and knee plates. Like most warrior suits, the Dhoukha- Thuegzinga is favored by marines and mercenaries.

Dhoukha-Laersdheg (Warrior Suit, TL8): This warrior suit includes an armored vest, shoulder guards, bracers and knee plates. Of all the warrior suits, this is the one most often used by corsairs who require heavy armor that looks imposing.

Dhoukha-Guengka (Warrior Suit, TL8): This warrior suit consists of an armored vest, gauntlets, knee plates and boots.

Dhoukha-Ghaghzorra (Warrior Suit, TL9): Comprising of an armored vest, shoulder guards, gauntlets and boots, this is the most advanced warrior suit providing good protection with lightweight materials.

Olok (Vacc Suit, TL8): Vargr Vacc Suits are much like their human counterparts but are specifi cally tailored to the physiological needs of the Vargr. The Vacc Suit provides basic life support functions for up to six hours. TL12 and TL14 versions are also available that are lighter and less cumbersome. Self- sealing technology is available at TL14.

Olokok (HEV Suit, TL8): The Hostile Environment Vacc Suit is a heavy version of the standard Vacc Suit. It is designed to withstand a number of environments and has the same functionality as the human equivalent (see pages 87-88 of the Traveller Core Rulebook). Like the standard Vacc Suit, TL12

and TL14 variants are also available with the TL14 version having self-sealing technology.

Ogou (Combat Vacc Suit, TL10): The threat of attack from corsairs is almost as high as the dangers of vacuum and hostile environments, making this combat variant of the HEV Suit a popular choice for many Vargr. Combat HEV suits are standard issue for all divisions of the navy, having the same properties as normal Vacc Suits but offering greater protection in combat. A TL14 variant is also available with self-sealing technology.

Khenourr (Combat Armor, TL12): Vargr combat armor is a complete armor suit primarily used by military divisions but can be obtained with relative ease by civilians. The khenourr offers the same functionality as the Ogou but is signifi cantly lighter and has greater protection.

Tsuenourr (Battle Dress, TL13/14): This military issue powered suit is the ultimate in combat protection and functionality. It works much like the human battle dress (see page 88 of the Traveller Core Rulebook) but provides more protection at the expense of the enhancements it grants to the wearer – the Tsuenourr provides an impressive protection of 19 but only has a +3 DM to Strength and Dexterity.

Options All standard options listed on page 88 of the Traveller Core Rulebook can be used with Vargr armor. Vargr specifi c options are listed below and although other races can acquire them, only Vargr characters will gain the full benefi ts.

Audio Filter (TL8): Usually fi tted into helmets, though they also come as earpieces, these devices fi lter all incoming audio to prevent very loud and high frequency sounds from damaging or disorienting the wearer. A character wearing an audio fi lter gains a +4 DM to their Endurance check against sonic weaponry. Cr. 50.

Blade Enhancements (TL6): Small blades or spikes mounted into the armor are popular with corsair raiders. These weapons can be used with the Melee (infi ghting) skill and deal 2d6 damage. They are usually mounted to Negdhazuk (Bracers) or Kforzonga (Shoulder Guards) but can be fi tted anywhere the wearer requires. Cr. 75.

Ornamentation (TL2): Although Vargr like to personalise their own armor, additional ornamentation is still very popular and can include tassels, braids and beads in a variety of bright colours. Cr. 10.

Retractable Blades (TL8): These function just like standard blade enhancements but a concealed controller allows the wearer to extend and retract the blades as required. Cr. 150.

#### AUGMENTS

Vargr opinion on the use of augments varies considerably throughout the Extents. Those of a religious nature tend to frown on Vargr augmentation, fi rm in the belief that the Vargr have already attained perfection or that it is blasphemous to alter the physical form given to them by the Ancients.

However, there are still many cultures that see the benefi ts of genetic and surgical alteration. The most notable applications are the physical and combat skill augments used by corsairs and the military. Intelligence and related augments see little use in Vargr society.

All augments listed in the Traveller Core Rulebook can be used by Vargr characters but the availability depends on the type of augment required at the Referees discretion.

Aural Filter (TL12): This works much like the audio fi lter option fi tted to armor to prevent loud and high frequency sounds from harming the character. A character with an aural fi lter gains a
+6 DM to their Endurance check against sonic weaponry. Cr. 15,000.

Tail Enhancement (TL10): The tailbones and muscles are enhanced to increase the strength and dexterity of the limb, allowing it to make an unarmed attack for 1d6 damage, knock down an opponent or disarm them. Attacking with the tail still uses a signifi cant action but the rarity of this augment will surprise most opponents (especially non-Vargr) making them unable to dodge or parry the blow in the fi rst Combat Round. Cr. 3,000.

Urzaeng Modifi cation (TL13): This augment evolved in the Urzaeng region by Vargr with a desire to fi t in and become more

like their Urzaeng brethren. Other Vargr are attracted by this augment simply to be more of a physical match for Urzaeng in combat. Many worlds have outlawed this modifi cation for a variety of reasons, usually on religious grounds.

The procedure for Urzaeng Modifi cation is long and painful, requiring a combination of genetic manipulation and surgery. Characters with this augment gain the following modifi cations:
+1 Strength, +1 Endurance and –1 Intelligence. The character's body also increases in size, gaining 2d6+6 cm in height and 1d6+4 kg in weight. Cr. 75,000.

#### ROBOTS & DRONES

Robots and drones are not as popular with the Vargr as they are with most other races. This is mainly because of the importance of Charisma in Vargr society; a robot has no place within the pack as it has no Charisma. For this reason, someone in charge of robots does not gain the same Charisma and respect as someone who commands other Vargr. Combat robots are also rare as sending machines to fi ght instead of Vargr shows weakness of not just the leader but of the entire pack.

However, robots are used in some commercial arenas such as factories, construction, hostile environments and as drivers or pilots for non-essential work. Robots are also used in an advisory capacity but Vargr will only consult such robots in private to avoid losing the respect of their subordinates.

As a science, Vargr robotics is not particularly advanced due to the social implications of using robots or simply being involved in the robotics industry. As such, Vargr robots tend to be overpriced, badly engineered and have low intelligence. The poor quality of Vargr robotics has led to many thriving criminal enterprises that steal robots from other races, particularly the Imperium.

Rueghz (Taskbot, TL12): This general purpose robot is one of the most advanced robots of Vargr design. A considerable skill set is included with this robot allowing it to perform a wide range of tasks. The rueghz is humanoid in appearance with the head design based on Vargr physiology.

Strength 7 (+0), Dexterity 5 (–1), Hull 1, Structure 1 Intelligence 3 (–1), Education 6 (+0) Traits: Computer/3 running Intellect/1, Expert Admin/1, Expert Drive/1, Expert Engineering/1, Expert Mechanic/1, Expert Medical/1 and Expert Steward/1, Integral toolkit Price: Cr. 100,000

Kfakhsue (Advisor, TL13): This small robot is primarily used in an advisory role by corporations and merchants; it can be consulted on all matters pertaining to bureaucracy, law and trade.

Strength 5 (–1), Dexterity 5 (–1), Hull 1, Structure 1 Intelligence 3 (–1), Education 9 (+1) Traits: Computer/3 running Intellect/2, Expert Admin/2, Expert Advocate/2, Expert Broker/2, Expert Economics/2, Integral grav fl oater Price: Cr. 150,000

#### WEAPONS

The Vargr have a wide variety of weapons and the most common are described here with both a generic (human) name and the original Vargr name. Vargr versions of human weapons also exist, differing in form but not in function; Vargr characters are free to use any of the standard weapons listed in the Traveller Core Rulebook.

Melee Weapons Most Vargr warriors, especially pirates, favor melee weapons. Bladed weapons are the most popular but the usual Vargr diversity means that a variety of weapons have evolved throughout Vargr history.

Weapon TL Range Damage Heft Mass (kg) Cost (Cr.) Danngag (Hunting Spear) 1 Melee (large blade) or Ranged (thrown)

2d6+2 0 2 10

Khenourr (Double Bladed Staff) 3 Melee (large blade) 2d6+4 2 3 150 Rokhkou (Long Sword) 3 Melee (large blade) 3d6 –1 1 100 Thuerrghough (Serrated Sword) 2 Melee (large blade) 3d6+4 1 2 200 Thuerrlakh (Serrated Knife) 2 Melee (small blade) 1d6+4 – 0.5 50 Tsozgho (Claw Fist) 4 Melee (small blade) 2d6 – – 10

Danngag (Hunting Spear, TL1): The danngag is the traditional hunting spear that the Vargr have been using since the early days on Lair. Little has changed since its fi rst incarnation except the material it is made from. Many hunters still favor the danngag for its silent effi ciency.

Khenourr (Double Bladed Staff, TL3): A long staff with a small blade at each end; much like a double-ended spear but this weapon cannot be thrown. Although it is the blades that infl ict damage, this weapon requires the Melee (bludgeon) skill to use. Anyone profi cient in its use (skill level of 1 or more) can make an additional attack per Combat Round with the opposite blade with a –4 DM.

Rokhkou (Long Sword, TL3): This well-balanced long sword is a favorite amongst many warriors. The blade has a slight curve with a small barb protruding from the blade's edge towards the tip of the sword. The rokhkou comes in numerous designs with variations on the number, size and position of the barb.

Thuerrghough (Serrated Sword, TL2): The thuerrghough is a large serrated sword. These vicious looking weapons are commonly used by corsairs, not just for their effectiveness but because the sight of such a weapon helps instil fear in their opponents.

Thuerrlakh (Serrated Knife, TL2): This large serrated knife is basically a smaller version of the thuerrghough and is often carried as a backup weapon by corsairs and mercenaries alike.

Tsozgho (Claw Fist, TL3): A spiked fi st weapon that fi ts over the hand and designed to look like claws. This is another good example of the types of weapon favored by corsairs for both practical and aesthetic purposes.

This is a very effective close combat weapon but the tsozgho must be strapped fi rmly onto the hand and takes 1d6 rounds

to attach or remove. The wearer also suffers a –2 DM penalty to any task that requires the use of their hand (not including combat). The tsozgho can be used with the Melee (infi ghting) or Melee (unarmed) skill.

Slug Throwers Over the centuries, Vargr slug throwers on most worlds have been modifi ed to use standard ammunition. However, the nature of the Vargr means that many worlds have not conformed to these standards so ammunition might not work in weapons purchased on a different world. To determine if a world sells compatible ammunition, roll 2d6; a roll of 6+ indicates that the correct ammunition can be purchased.

Ueggvun (Pistol, TL4): This pistol is a common sidearm on many low-tech worlds and was the fi rst Vargr slug thrower to have a magazine.

Ukszou (Autopistol, TL6): These semi-automatic pistols are used by law enforcement, mercenaries and military groups throughout the Extents.

Koekkha (Hunting Rifl e, TL3): Once the Vargr discovered gunpowder this hunting rifl e replaced the danngag in numerous packs but many Vargr still favored the traditional hunting spear over the noisy rifl e. The koekkha is only a single shot weapon but its long range gives it an advantage over the spear.

Doekha (Hunting Rifl e, TL5): The successor to the koekkha, the doekha is quieter and delivers more damage. Although it was primarily designed for hunting, the doekha also sees a reasonable amount of combat use.

Knugzang (Autorifl e, TL7): Designed purely for combat the knugzang automatic rifl e is standard issue in many armed forces and a favorite amongst mercenaries too.

Sonic Weapons During the pre-stellar era on Lair, opposing Vargr factions began experimenting with sonic weaponry to disorient the enemy on the battlefi eld using ultra high frequency sounds. These weapons can only work where there is air and are more effective on the acute hearing of the Vargr – the effects last two rounds less for other races (with a minimum of one round).

The effects of sonic weapons can be reduced by audio fi lters and military use of sonic weapons soon declined once protection became widely available. However, they have become popular with law enforcement divisions who require non-lethal weapons.

Ongrrou (Sonic Pistol, TL9): The sonic pistol emits a directed sound wave at its target. Anyone hit by the ongrrou must make an Endurance check with a –2 DM; if successful the target is

unaffected, if they fail the target falls unconscious for 1d6 rounds and is disoriented for a further 1d6 rounds after they recover.

Ongrung (Sonic Rifl e, TL9): The sonic rifl e emits a powerful directed sound wave at its target. Anyone hit by the ongrung must make an Endurance check with a –4 DM; if successful the target is disoriented for 1d6 rounds, if they fail the target falls unconscious for 2d6 rounds and are disoriented for a further 1d6 rounds after they recover.

Odhkhu (Sonic Grenade, TL8): Sonic grenades emit a blast of high frequency sound to stun anyone within range. Anyone hit by an odhkhu must make an Endurance check with a –4 DM
(–6 DM for TL10 version); if successful the target is disoriented for 1d6 rounds, if they fail the target falls unconscious for 1d6 rounds and are disoriented for a further 1d6 rounds after they recover.

#### VEHICLES

Most Vargr vehicles are much like their human counterparts in ability and function. However, the aesthetics of Vargr vehicles are much more decorative and elaborate with a variety of fi ns, spines and bright colours that look garish and tasteless to most humans. Many vehicles also comprise of mismatch of components scavenged from various sources. Markings are often painted on the vehicles to indicate race wins or in the case of military vehicles, kills or pack insignia.

The vehicles listed here are common Vargr designs but most vehicles detailed in other Traveller books are also available.

Dhouzersan Plasma Tank The Dhouzersan Plasma Tank is a gravitic tank that has become the standard fi ghting vehicle of most Vargr army divisions. Armed with a variety of plasma-based weapons the Dhouzersan is effective against a wide range of enemy forces.

Gravitic Racer Vargr might not share the same taste in design as humans but both races do share a love of speed and grav racing. Unlike human grav racers Vargr designs incorporate a passenger or co-pilot seat; such is their need for companionship they like to share the racing experience with their brethren. The racer can be driven alone but the co-pilot usually serves as the navigator so they have more participation in the race.

## SSTTARSHIPSARSHIPS AANDND SSPPACEACE TTRRAVELAVEL

The basic details of space travel remain the same whether in

Vargr or human space. The exceptions are noted here.

#### INTERSTELLAR TRAVEL

There are several customs and important facts to consider when

travelling onboard Vargr ships and within the Vargr Extents.

Travellers Tips Travellers visiting Vargr worlds should be aware of four key points:

- Charisma: Assess your standing in Vargr society
  and consider the charisma of all Vargr you meet.
- Privilege: In Vargr society, all levels of charisma
  grant varying degrees of privileges. Be sure to
  demand your dues according to your status but
  also consider others.
- Respect: Vargr respect people who stick by their
  decisions and do not waver in the face of adversity,
  so be assertive in your dealings. Likewise, Vargr
  expect to earn respect for the same reasons.
- Praise: Vargr constantly seek approval from their
  superiors so it is important to praise subordinates
  so they know you value their skills.

Passage Types: Passage on Vargr ships has the same three categories as on human vessels: low passage, middle passage and high passage. Characters can be 'bumped' from a berth by a character with a higher Charisma, regardless of the class of ticket they have. This often has a chain effect of the bumped character

consequently bumping someone else with lower Charisma.

The Low Lottery: This custom (detailed on page 142 of the Traveller Core Rulebook) is practiced by some Vargr captains but not by others. To randomly determine if a ship's captain runs a lottery, roll 1d6; on a 1–4 he does not, a roll of 5–6 indicates

that he does.

The Traveller's Aid Society: There is no Vargr institution comparable to the TAS that covers the Vargr Extents in its entirety but smaller organizations do exist that offer similar services on a smaller scale. Those that do exist vary in size, standards and the services they offer. Referees are free to

determine the nature of any such organizations if they wish their players to have access to them.

Spacecraft Purchase: Due to the unstable nature of Vargr economics, fi nancing options for spacecraft are somewhat limited. Characters wishing to acquire their own spacecraft must either have the credits or a wealthy patron or employer who is willing to provide a ship in return for services, a cut of their profi ts or some other benefi t.

Successfully obtaining a ship from a patron will largely be determined by the Charisma of those seeking to acquire the vessel. The diffi culty of this will depend on the value of the ship and the type of deal negotiated but it will usually be a Diffi cult task. Referees can apply DMs accordingly with the negotiating skills of the characters involved. If a ship is provided, it usually remains the property of the patron until it has been paid off in value or by services.

Ship shares obtained during character creation can also be used to put towards a ship, in the form of contacts, savings, favors or money owed to the character. Vargr ship shares rarely represent credit rating or similar fi nance options.

Alternatively, characters can always attempt to steal or hijack a ship but such methods could well have consequences at a later date when the owner or captain fi nally tracks them down. Characters with a high Charisma can also try to convince a captain of lower Charisma to follow their leadership but such an endeavor will require outstanding skills of negotiation, persuasion and leadership.

Borders: Vargr do not recognize borders and territories like humans do. Established borders are an abstract concept to most Vargr, especially corsair raiders who will think nothing of crossing borders to raid a ship, whether it is a border between Vargr governments or alien worlds.

Piracy: Piracy, hijacking, raiding and similar crimes are more frequent in Vargr space than in the Imperium. Roll on the Corsair Encounters table on page 66 once per trip using the appropriate modifi ers (modifi ers are cumulative and applied to the tens dice only) to determine what type of vessels (if any) are encountered. For unusually long trips, several rolls can be made at the Referees discretion. If a corsair band is encountered, use the Encounter Distance table on page 140 of the Traveller Core Rulebook to determine the range of the vessels.

#### CREWS

The Vargr pack mentality onboard a spacecraft is more signifi cant than any other environment. The long periods of time spent in a confi ned space rely on the pack dynamics for Vargr to function effectively as a crew. Although the typical infi ghting and power struggles are as prominent here as anywhere else, the camaraderie of the crew is essential to its success – mutinies are rare

unless the leader constantly fails in his duties.

The hierarchies and dynamics of the pack are also more varied onboard starships than most other situations. As with all packs, there is always a leader but an individual's Charisma gains and losses depend on how important their role is perceived to be by the rest of the crew. These priorities can also change according to various situations; for example, a medic might not be

considered particularly important until the crew become dependent on him for their survival.

Large crews are often made up of several packs divided by their roles such as fl ight crew, engineers and gunners. Marines and other fi ghting crewmen are also grouped in their own packs, divided into units depending on their numbers. Corsair crews differ

slightly in that the captain usually leads the raider unit in addition to commanding the ship.

#### VARGR SCOUT

Using a 100-ton hull, the Vargr scout ship is primarily used by the navy and corsair bands for reconnaissance and ground support duties. Vargr scouts are also used by lone prospectors. Much like its Imperial counterpart, the Vargr scout is a common sight in the Extents and is therefore easy to maintain and repair.

The Vargr scout only requires a crew of one pilot but a gunner is usually carried as well. Two additional crew or personnel can be carried with double occupancy if required.

#### VARGR TRADER

This interstellar trading vessel uses a 200-ton hull and is used extensively in the Vargr Extents. Like most Vargr ships, the Vargr trader is armored to provide protection against the many corsair bands that prowl the trade lanes.

The crew usually consists of a pilot, navigator, engineer, medic and gunner. Passengers are not normally carried on these vessels.

#### VARGR COURIER

Using a 200-ton hull, the Vargr courier is designed for the fast transport of emissaries and messages over interstellar distances. The courier is generally used by military and government organizations for diplomatic and intelligence purposes.

The Vargr courier requires a crew of four; a pilot, navigator, engineer and medic. Four additional crew or passengers such as emissaries and gunners can also be carried with double occupancy.

#### VARGR PACKET

This large merchant vessel has a 600-ton hull and is designed to transport both passengers and cargo. It is well armed to defend against would-be raiders. The Vargr packet is primarily used as a passenger liner with the cargo space allocated to luggage storage and supplies.

The Vargr packet typically has a crew of nine, consisting of a pilot, navigator, three engineers, medic and three stewards. Many of the crew also serve as gunners in the event of a corsair attack. The ship can carry up to 24 high or middle class passengers with double occupancy, and 10 low passengers.

#### VARGR FRIGATE

Using an 800-ton hull, the Vargr frigate is commonly used by the Vargr military for patrols and fi ghting corsair raiders. Some variants of the frigate sacrifi ce one of the fi ghters for three additional G-Carriers, allowing a full complement of troops to be deployed in a single assault.

The Vargr frigate has a core crew of sixteen, consisting of a pilot, navigator, medic, fi ve engineers and eight gunners. Two fi ghter pilots and 12 combat troops for boarding parties are usually carried as well. With double occupancy a further 30 troops can also be carried for missions that require additional marines or soldiers.

## EENNCOUNTERSCOUNTERS

Encounters in Vargr space are similar to most other places but certain factors should be taken into consideration when dealing with the Vargr and their worlds.

#### REACTIONS

The Vargr mindset is somewhat different to that of other races and their reactions to different people and situations vary greatly. Referees can use the Reaction table to determine the reaction of Vargr characters in any encounter or situation.

Using the Reaction Table Vargr NPCs can have their reactions governed by the Reaction table as the situation or Referee requires. This most often occurs when a situation involves uncertainty between dominant and subordinate Vargr. Players may also fi nd it useful to use the Reaction table, especially if they are new to playing Vargr characters.

To use the Reaction table, roll 2d6, apply the relevant DMs and read off the result in the Reaction table.

REACTION 2d6 Reaction 2 or less Hostile: Attack on 6+ 3 Hostile: Attack on 8+ 4 Hostile: Attack on 11+ 5 Hostile: May attack 6 Unreceptive 7 Noncommittal 8 Interested 9 Intrigued 10 Responsive 11 Enthusiastic 12 or more Genuinely Friendly

Reaction Table Results Hostile attacks tend to result in unarmed combat with Vargr using their Melee (infi ghting) skill, especially if the Encounter has lower Charisma than the Character. A hostile reaction can potentially result in the loss of Charisma for Vargr characters depending on the situation.

Reaction Throw DMs: Character is the individual consulting the table; Encounter is the individual reacting using the table. Character... DM Encounter... DM Other DM is an emissary +1 is an emissary +2 Local world population 8+ –1 Charisma, per level +1 Charisma, per level –1 Different subspecies –1 Diplomat, per level +1 Diplomat, per level +1 Leadership, per level +1 is a pack leader +1

#### SAMPLE VARGR PATRONS

Vuernaeku Oulrreth Requirements: Diplomat, Persuade, Melee, Gun Combat, Spacecraft. Rewards: Cr. 2,000/day plus expenses plus a bonus for each successful mission. Player's Information: Vuernaeku is an emissary in his late years. He has short grey hair and long droopy ears. Vuernaeku is an accomplished diplomat but his pack recently left him to support a younger arbitrator. He is now seeking a new group of aides, bodyguards and advisors.

Referee's Information: For the last year Vuernaeku's memory has been failing, which is why his pack left him for they feared he would make a critical mistake that would refl ect badly on the entire pack. However, Vuernaeku has amassed quite a fortune in his many years of negotiation and he is willing to share this with anyone who supports him.

1. Vuernaeku is resolving a trade dispute between two rival junk dealers who operate in this system but are based on different worlds; Onguegzvaer is a large corporation and Dhangouo is an independent but successful dealer. Dhangouo is accusing Onguegzvaer of stealing its clients and making slanderous remarks that have resulted in the loss of substantial profi ts. The players must aid Vuernaeku by investigating the rival corporations and their claims, which will involve travelling between worlds and escorting Vuernaeku throughout the negotiations. 2. Vuernaeku has been hired to ease political tensions between neighboring Vargr governments. If he fails, the current

hostilities could escalate into war. Many of the Vargr involved do not want peace and Vuernaeku requires constant protection in case anyone should attempt to take his life, thus ending the negotiations.

3. As 2 but the political confl ict is between the local Vargr government and a neighboring human government. Vuernaeku must travel to the human world to make reparations for the frequent attacks on the human spacelanes by Vargr corsairs. The human world is known to have groups with anti-Vargr sentiments and Vuernaeku requires protection and aides who are familiar with humans and their customs. 4. Recent corsair raids have caused severe trade problems as the major routes have become too dangerous for merchants to travel. The local government's military is not suffi cient to deal with the situation so they wish to negotiate a deal with the corsairs before the local populace become disillusioned with their leaders. The players must help Vuernaeku to track down the corsairs and aide him in the negotiations between the government and the corsairs. 5. The local government wishes to enlist the help of a formidable corsair band to help defend the local system against a rival government or faction. Vuernaeku hires the players to help him fi nd the corsair ship and broker a deal. Making contact and establishing a dialogue will be diffi cult and dangerous. 6. As 5 but the government is concerned that the neighboring government is becoming too powerful. The local government want to hire the corsair band to raid the rival government. If the corsairs are successful they should help to reduce trade in the rival's territories and therefore weaken that government's leadership.

Uzagz Requirements: Investigate, Persuade, Spacecraft. Rewards: Cr. 50,000. Player's Information: Uzagz is a charismatic religious leader. He is a middle aged Vargr with red fur and a bushy tail. He speaks very slowly with long pauses to captivate his listeners and display his charisma. Uzagz requires assistance with his congregation.

Referee's Information: Uzagz grew up in the Enclaves as a descendent of the Suedzuk. Shamed by his ancestors he left the Enclaves to make his mark amongst his brethren. Uzagz will not openly declare his origins but if questioned enough he will reveal the truth.

1. Uzagz leads a congregation of the Church of the Chosen Ones (see page 115). Unfortunately, his small following has not been received well in the community and the religious group have decided to leave for another world where they are more

welcome and their faith is accepted more readily. Due to the many scientists that attempt to disprove the claims of the Church of the Chosen Ones, Uzagz thinks his congregation would be best served on a low-tech world.

2. Uzagz is in the process of revitalising an old faith and needs help to drum up support and build his congregation. The Gnangdougzoun religion (meaning 'true to oneself') has a pantheon of deities that embody the key traits of the Vargr: Rrognodoe the God of Charisma, Desounknuen the God of Loyalty and Estidzu the God of Companionship. 3. Uzagz is part of a growing religion called the Children of the Ancients, which is founded on the belief that all Vargr were not just created by the Ancients but that the Vargr were created from the Ancients to carry on in their ancestor's name. Despite evidence that invalidates this theory, the Children of the Ancients are particularly appealing to many Vargr. However, many people see this religion as a cult that preys on the racial pride of all Vargr and that they have some ulterior motive. Uzagz hires the players to observe his congregation and prove that the rumors are not true. 4. As 3 but Uzagz is hiding something; he does not believe in his religion and has created it to gain charisma and leadership over a large pack. The donations made by his followers are simply a bonus as far as he is concerned. 5. Using any of the religions described above, a rival religion that promotes the antithesis of Uzagz's teachings is gathering support in the community. Uzagz's followers are loyal to their faith and hostilities between the two religions are increasing. Most of Uzagz's congregation are simple citizens who lack the skills should the situation escalate to violence. 6. Using any of the religions described above, Uzagz has reason to believe that agents of the Faarzgaen religion (see page 35) have infi ltrated his congregation in an attempt to convert his followers by discrediting Uzagz's religion. He needs outsiders to discover who is behind these blasphemous acts and deal with the problem appropriately.

Narro Ghudhtha Requirements: Deception, Gun Combat, Persuade, Spacecraft. Rewards: Cr. 1,000/day. Player's Information: Narro is a disaffected government offi cial who has frequently been placed in poor positions of authority. As a result of being a remote authority fi gure she gained little loyalty from her subordinates and lost Charisma (through no fault of her own). Narro believes she would make a good leader but needs the right opportunity to do so.

Referee's Information: Narro has made some poor decisions that led to her recent replacement but she has learned from her mistakes and desperately wants to gain Charisma and a position of power, and will go to any lengths to do so.

1. Narro wants a more direct leadership role but has been unable to gain enough support to prove her Charisma and leadership abilities. By hiring citizens to work for her she hopes to slowly build trust with her superiors to prove she has the Charisma to lead other Vargr. 2. Narro has gained some support from the local populace who are displeased with the current leadership. She wants to leave this planet and start a new settlement outside the reaches of the government where she can lead and govern her people. She has a small retinue acting as an advanced scout party but she needs a ship to fi nd and secure a suitable location. Narro will pay standard passenger fees for this in addition to the daily rate she is offering. 3. Narro is planning a coup and is seeking a group of Vargr that share her concerns. Together, they can gain support and push the current leaders out of power. She will accept help from non-Vargr but they must understand Vargr society and be able to help in this task. 4. As 3 but due to lack of support, Narro is planning a hostile takeover. She requires a group of mercenaries who can help her seize control of the government headquarters by any means necessary. 5. As 4 but instead of a physical attack, Narro plans to bring the government down from within. She believes this can be done by humiliating the current administration, causing them to lose face and Charisma. 6. As 4 but Narro intends to use political or trade pressure from neighboring governments, races or organizations. With trade embargos and diplomatic treaties the populace will lose faith in the government allowing Narro to step in; once in power she can lift the embargos and earn the loyalty of the people.

Thanakh Requirements: Broker, Persuade, Spacecraft. Rewards: Cr. 25,000 plus expenses, but can only pay once his deal is concluded. Player's Information: Thanakh is an independent junk dealer seeking to expand his business. He is a young Vargr and although he earns a modest living selling second hand equipment, it is obvious that he does not have the Charisma to become as successful as he would like. Thanakh needs a ship and a crew to obtain goods and establish new trade partners.

Referee's Information: Thanakh's business is struggling and he is experiencing fi nancial diffi culties. He is desperate to get cheap stock and make a decent sale soon or he will be forced into bankruptcy.

1. Thanakh wishes to start trading in Imperial space in the hope that his lack of Charisma will not impede his progress with humans as it does with Vargr. However, he knows little about human culture and seeks advisors and guides to fi nd the right people to trade with. 2. As 1 but Thanakh also requires a ship to transport his goods. He will pay an additional Cr. 25,000 if the players transport his goods on their ship. 3. Thanakh has obtained a large quantity of illegal goods such as weapons or drugs. He thinks he knows a buyer on a nearby world but he needs a ship to transport the goods and some muscle to protect him from the criminal elements he must deal with. 4. Thanakh has heard news that a large corporation on a neighboring world is in serious fi nancial diffi culties and could well go out of business. He wants to hire a ship that can get him there in time to buy the stock before rival dealers beat him to it, some of which will use a number of dirty tactics to win the deal.
   5. The employees of a mid-sized company based in a
   neighboring subsector were forced to fl ee when a war broke
   out and some of them were killed in the process. With that
   corporation now out of business, Thanakh is looking for a group
   that can help him to 'liberate' the equipment left behind.
   6. A rival junk dealer called Nazrra has been responsible for
   many of Thanakh's problems such as stealing Thanakh's clients
   and intercepting his purchases. Thanakh hires the players to
   deal with the situation in whatever way they can.

Rorzza Requirements: Prospecting, Sensors, Pilot, Spacecraft. Rewards: A share of the profi ts, up to 50% split amongst the party. Player's Information: Rorzza is a prospector down on his luck. His ship was destroyed by corsairs during his last job and he barely made it out alive but he managed to escape and was rescued. Just before the attack he had found what he believed to be a large mineral deposit that could potentially be worth millions but he needs a ship and a crew.

Referee's Information: Rorzza is an experienced and trusted prospector. He is a likable character and although he is a loner he has quite a high Charisma and would actually make a good leader if he chose to be. The actual size and value of the mineral deposit is Cr. 1d6 x 100,000 or 1d6 x 1,000,000 at the Referees discretion.

1. Rorzza did not get a chance to confi rm his fi nd before the attack so his plan is to return to the region he was searching, fi nd the deposit and confi rm its value. If successful he can sell the confi rmed location to a buyer and share the profi ts with the players. 2. As 1 but Rorzza wants to extract the ore himself (with the help of the players of course). To do this the players will need to invest in some equipment such as mining drones and mining lasers. The ship's sensors might also need an upgrade if they are not up to the job. 3. As 2 but Rorzza wants to return to where his ship was attacked and salvage any remains. With any luck there will be enough equipment left that can be used to fi nish the job. For each item required roll 1d6; on a 1–3 it was destroyed or taken, on a 4–5 the equipment remains but is damaged (but can be repaired), on a roll of 6 the item is found intact. 4. Rorzza will reveal that it was not corsairs that attacked him but it was a rival prospector who was after Rorzza's claim. Rorzza wants to take his rival's ship as payment and revenge for what happened, but he needs the players' help to do so. His rival, a Vargr by the name of Gvoekh, is most likely mining the ore right now so speed is essential if the players are to help Rorzza, retrieve the ore and fi nd a buyer.

2. Rorzza's fi nd was actually on an asteroid where the corsair band had their secret base. Rorzza may or may not have determined this so the players will need to deal with this once they arrive – if Rorzza was not aware of the situation the party will be unprepared when they encounter the corsairs. 6. Although Rorzza's story is convincing, it is not entirely true. Rorzza joined the small corsair band seeing the potential benefi ts but after the fi ght, both ships were badly damaged and the corsair band wants to acquire a new one. Rorzza intends to lure the players to a remote planet and while the players are

'helping' Rorzza, the corsairs will take the ship

Kherzrra Requirements: Gun Combat, Gunnery, Pilot, Spacecraft. Rewards: Cr. 1,000/day plus expenses per person. Player's Information: Kherzrra is a mercenary who has proven her resourcefulness time and again. Such is her skill and Charisma that she has been hired by governments and distinguished emissaries. Kherzrra is smaller than one would expect for a mercenary but her strength comes not from her size, but her quickness of body and mind; she is a skilled pilot and an excellent marksman. Kherzrra hires the players for her next mission.

Referee's Information: Kherzrra is frequently offered prestige jobs that pay well and offer good opportunities for Charisma gain. She works alone and hires people as and when she needs them to complete a mission. She is extremely loyal and has built up a number of contacts and allies in large corporations, the government and the military. Kherzrra has her own ship but it can be undergoing repairs or even destroyed if the Referee would rather have the players use their ship.

1. Kherzrra has been hired by the government or military to deal with the growing corsair problem in the area. She is looking for suitable people to crew a number of ships capable of defeating the medium-sized corsair band. Kherzrra has her own ship that requires a crew but she also needs additional ships. 2. Kherzrra has been hired to rescue a governor who has been taken captive by dissidents. She requires the help of the players to complete her mission. The governor is deep within enemy territory and is being interrogated for a variety of government secrets. The party must rescue the governor before any secrets are revealed. 3. As 2 but the players must also help Kherzrra locate the governor using whatever investigation methods they are capable of. 4. Kherzrra is hired to escort a government offi cial, emissary or someone else of importance to a secret meeting in enemy territory. This person is attempting to negotiate a peace treaty but there are many factions who wish to prevent this.
   5. As 4 but the person being escorted is actually planning to
   switch sides once at the destination. Once he is safe the players
   will realise what he was up to. As a loyal Vargr, Kherzrra will not
   accept this and will ask the players to help her capture him and
   take him back before he can reveal government secrets to the
   enemy.
   6. Kherzrra is on a secret mission to assassinate a rival leader
   and requires passage to a nearby world or subsector. Once
   she has completed her mission it will soon become apparent to
   the players what she has done and they must smuggle her out
   of enemy territory, abandon her or change their loyalties and
   attempt to capture her for rewards and Charisma.

Kungak Requirements: Engineer, Gun Combat, Pilot. Rewards: A share of the loot. Player's Information: Kungak is a corsair raider and certainly looks the part; he is large, even for an Urzaeng and has numerous tattoos and scars. He has been with a number of corsair bands where he has gained the experience and Charisma to become a powerful leader. Kungak wants to recruit the players into his corsair band.

Referee's Information: Kungak grew up in the Urzaeng region but he is not of that subspecies. After spending so much time amongst the Urzaeng he sought to become one and after several successful raids he paid to have the Urzaeng augment so he would become more like his brethren. However, this is something he keeps to himself and he portrays himself as if he were a natural born Urzaeng.

1. Kungak is the only survivor of his last corsair band due to a failure in leadership (he was not the leader). He is now recruiting a new band to crew the ship and thinks the players have what it takes to be a corsair. His ship, a Vargr Corsair called 'Dhangouo'

(Vendetta), was badly damaged during his last encounter and needs a lot of work before it is battle ready so Kungak needs good engineers as well as crewmen and raiders. 2. As 1, but Kungak is also a wanted criminal and it was the navy that attacked his ship and killed the rest of his band. The authorities are still after him so Kungak must be careful how he approaches the players and will need their help to avoid another run-in with the navy. 3. Kungak already belongs to a band but does not have enough support to take command. He wants to recruit new members that are loyal to him, giving him enough support to take leadership of the entire band. Kungak thinks the players could be the people he needs to achieve his ambitions. 4. Kungak is already the leader of a successful corsair band but a splinter group took one of his ship's to start their own band.

Kungak is looking to recruit replacements so he can seek out his new rivals and demonstrate to his remaining crew that he is still the dominant leader.

5. Kungak is a popular leader of a successful corsair band and is planning to expand his group. He has heard of the players and wishes to take them on as a pack within his entire band. He will provide a ship if the players do not have a suitable vessel and they will operate as a separate pack under Kungak's command. 6. Kungak and his band hijack the player's ship to steal the cargo. However, once he boards their ship he will see their potential and will give them the opportunity to join his band.

Sunthazokh Khoedhae Requirements: Gun Combat, Investigate, Melee, Stealth. Rewards: Cr. 10,000 and a Contact. Player's Information: Sunthazokh is a private investigator. She is average looking and walks with a limp. Sunthazokh has a good reputation and is well regarded by many organizations. Sunthazokh hires the players to help her on her current case.

Referee's Information: Sunthazokh is very intelligent but not particularly good in a fi ght and often hires mercenaries if she feels her investigations will lead her into dangerous situations, which they often do.

1. A trading outpost has been the victim of several raids by a corsair band. The corsairs seem to know whenever a valuable shipment departs the outpost and the traders have pooled their resources and hired Sunthazokh to discover if anyone is working for the pirates. Sunthazokh suspects this could get dangerous and hires the players for protection.

The informant is a resident junk dealer called Dhaergarz who has been losing a lot of business to more successful rivals. In order to prevent his business from going bankrupt he now works for the corsair band and gets paid a cut of the loot. The players will need to follow Dhaergarz to prove his involvement and there is a good chance that the party will have to confront the corsair band.

2. Sunthazokh has been hired by the military to discover what happened to a special ops unit that disappeared on a world that lies within a rival government. The situation could be hostile so she hires the players as protection. The special ops unit were discovered by the opposing military and the few survivors are being held captive to be questioned. Once the players fi nd out what happened Sunthazokh will want them to rescue the captives before they reveal any secrets to the enemy. 3. Sunthazokh has been hired by a local farmer, Llagthar, to fi nd out why a pack in his workforce left to join his rival, the Ngourr

Corporation. The Ngourr Corporation is quite large and although successful, their upper management is not very charismatic. Sunthazokh is known to this company so she needs the players to gain employment with them; once on the inside the players will eventually discover that not only does the Ngourr Corporation pay well, but the lack of charismatic leadership means there are many opportunities for advancement and Sunthazokh's workers came here so they would be in a higher position of authority.

4. During an investigation for the local government, Sunthazokh has uncovered a coup. Her life is now in danger as the dissidents want her dead before she can report her fi ndings. Sunthazokh has no way to directly communicate with her contact without revealing her position and she hires the players as protection so she can get to her employer. 5. As 4 but Sunthazokh agrees with the dissidents and wants to join their cause. Aware of the coup, the current administration has hired mercenaries to track down and kill anyone who opposes the government's rule. Sunthazokh needs the players to help her make contact with the dissidents without attracting the attention of the local law enforcement. 6. Sunthazokh has been hired by a research institute to retrieve a stolen alien artefact. The artefact is a dangerous and deadly weapon and has been stolen by agents from a rival government or organization. Sunthazokh has tracked down the culprits and needs the players' help to retrieve the artefact from them.

Annuek Requirements: Persuade, Spacecraft. Rewards: Ally. Player's Information: Annuek is a female psion who initially trained herself but has since had further tuition from mentors and institutes. She is an attractive Vargr and comes across as very confi dent and resourceful. Annuek has no money but if the players help her she will become an Ally.

Referee's Information: Annuek uses her natural charm to her advantage but she has had a tough life and trust does not come easily to her; she will only deal with highly charismatic people who can win her trust.

1. Annuek has escaped from a Vargr psionic institution that was performing experiments on her. The researchers have hired mercenaries to track Annuek and retrieve her so she is seeking safe passage offworld. 2. As 1 but Annuek is fl eeing a Zhodani institute that are researching Vargr psionics. Zhodani agents have been dispatched to apprehend her. 3. Annuek knows how tough life can be for a Vargr psion so she is seeking other psions, particularly Vargr, to train and mentor.

2. As 3 but she plans to create a new Vargr psionic institute. She will hire the players to help out in a variety of ways such as seeking out new students and transportation. 5. This world has outlawed psionics and Annuek is wanted by the government for her crimes. She is seeking passage off this world and into a safe region of the Extents.
   6. As 5 but Annuek is wanted for government secrets she has
   obtained, or believed to have obtained, using her talents. Once
   safely off this world, Annuek plans to sell the information to a
   rival government in exchange for her safety and she needs the
   players to help if she is to be successful.

#### RANDOM ENCOUNTERS

In addition to random encounters, this section details the differences between Vargr locations and their equivalents in human space.

Vargr Starports Unlike starports in the Imperium, Vargr ports are usually run by the primary government of that world who have full jurisdiction over the entire starport. This allows the government to restrict access to rival factions and control who they trade with. However, the reality of the situation is that too many embargos would be the catalyst for a change of leadership or an exodus of the population, so governments only exercise this control in severe circumstances (such as a war with a neighboring government).

Starports are generally chaotic and noisy; Vargr haggle and argue over prices and rules, fi lling the air with deep growls and guttural grunts. Infi ghting is commonplace as individuals compete for dominance and challenge unworthy captains. Ships of all designs can be seen docked at the port with a variety of bright colours and decoration.

Vargr Cities Vargr cities are much like the starports but on a grander scale. The diversity of architecture and colour is much greater, as is the infi ghting and raised voices. Small bazaars are scattered throughout the city for independent merchants and junk dealers to sell their wares. The result is a cacophony of sound, smell and colour throughout the city with no apparent plan or design.

Rural Areas Heavily populated worlds, such as Lair, do not have many rural areas and those that do exist tend to be reserved for agricultural needs. On worlds where the Vargr population has not been so invasive there are both agricultural and wild regions.

Number encountered: 1d3 Ksarrg are large cat-like creatures with sharp tusks protruding from their lower jaw. These predators are the most appetising beasts indigenous to the Vargr homeworld.

## WWOORLDSRLDS

Of all the major races, Vargr worlds are most like human worlds. The physical details remain the same and the process for creating worlds is the same as detailed in the Traveller Core Rulebook. However, due to the differences in Vargr society the governments, law levels, bases and trade codes have been changed to varying degrees to refl ect the uniqueness of the Vargr race.

#### PLANETARY GOVERNMENT

All types of government can be found on Vargr worlds and they vary in size from control over a continent or region to larger governments having infl uence over entire worlds and systems. Very few governments are able to extend their reach beyond a single star system and those that do rely on charismatic individuals to inspire their people; such ruling powers rarely endure beyond the lifespan of the leader.

Vargr Governments Like all aspects of Vargr society, governments are in a constant state of fl ux. Borders are poorly defi ned, changing as the government gains and loses infl uence over its people. It is also important to note that a government does not necessarily have exclusive authority over the people within its boundaries; it is not uncommon for smaller governments to exist within the borders of a larger one and some groups may remain independent regardless of whether they are located within a government's boundaries.

To determine the primary government on a Vargr world, roll 2d6

- population level; on a result of 16+ the government is type 7

(Balkanization), otherwise determine the government as normal
(which can still result in Balkanization).

Factions To determine the total number of factions on the world, roll 1d6 with a +1 DM if the government type is 0 or 7, and a –1 DM if the government type is 10 or more, then consult the Factions table.

FACTIONS

Result Factions 0–1 1 2–3 2 4–5 3 64 75

Determine the government type for each additional faction as normal. However, the government type of each faction does not necessarily imply that a faction is a rebel group or splinter government as it would on human worlds. Many disaffected Vargr do form their own governments but they do not necessarily adopt the same form of leadership. Factions are just as likely to have started independently, than to have formed as splinter or rebel groups of the primary government.

To determine the type of faction, roll 1d6 and refer to the Faction Type table. Faction Strength is determined as detailed in the Traveller Core Rulebook, page 173.

FACTION TYPE 1d6 Faction Type 1 Settlers – travelled here from another world 2–4 Independent – established independently from the primary government 5–6 Disaffected – splinter or rebel group of primary government

Government Diversity Vargr diversity is found as much in their governments as in any other aspect of their culture. Worlds that have the same government code can be very different in their structure and how they operate, much more so than on human worlds.

Even within a single government, separate divisions will usually work quite differently depending on the individual in charge – once that person is replaced (which can happen all too frequently) the new leader might change certain procedures. These changes can ripple up through the ranks as other offi cials are replaced, resulting in governments that continually change in response to their leaders and environment. Such transformations are often visible to the citizens but they can also happen with little or no effect on the populace.

#### LAW LEVELS

The law level of Vargr worlds indicates the government stability in addition to the law enforcement activity. Lower law levels signify a more stable government and less harassment by the local law authority. When visiting a Vargr world, the Referee should roll for police activity and civil unrest as detailed below.

Police Activity: This is determined as detailed on page 173 of the Traveller Core Rulebook. Referees may wish to add further penalties for non-Vargr and Vargr subspecies on worlds where there is less tolerance to outsiders.

Civil Unrest: Once per week roll 2d6 and add the appropriate modifi ers; a roll equal to or less than the law level indicates local disorder and civil unrest. To determine the type of disorder roll 2d6 on the Civil Unrest table. Depending on the nature and severity of the disorder the temporary effects can include any of the following: shops are closed, public transport and air traffi c is suspended, starport locked down, law enforcement or the military are out in force, martial law is declared.

Government Type Modifi er Type 7, Balkanization –2 Type 10, Charismatic Dictator +3 Type 12, Charismatic Oligarchy +4

CIVIL UNREST

2d6 Civil Unrest 2–3 Political demonstration – individuals unhappy with the current administration are demonstrating to gain the support of their brethren. 4–5 Riot – a riot of disaffected Vargr breaks out in a major city or spaceport. 6 Political independence – a group of unsatisfi ed Vargr have declared themselves independent, forming their own government within the boundaries of the existing government. 7 Political uprising – a pack of disaffected Vargr are gaining support to force the current leaders out of power to be replaced with their own charismatic leader. 8–9 Political coup – elements within the government seek to take control by force of personality. 10–11 Military coup – disaffected Vargr with strong ties to the military attempt to seize control by force of arms. 12 Civil war – a civil war has broken out between rival factions.

#### BASES

Many Vargr governments maintain their own naval bases but they do not have scout bases. Corsair bands can also have their own bases and it is entirely possible for them to coexist with naval bases. The type of bases present on a world depends on the type of starport that exists there.

Begin by rolling 2d6 and cross-reference the relevant starport column with the naval base row to see if a naval base is present. Follow the same procedure for the corsair base but apply a –2 DM if a naval base is already present.

Starport A Starport B Starport C Starport D Starport E Starport X Corsair Base 11+ 10+ 9+ 8+ 7+ 6+ Naval Base 7+ 8+ 9+ 10+ – –

Corsair (C): Corsair bases do not have the full range of facilities as navy bases but provide enough support for the corsair band to refuel and maintain their ships. Corsair bases usually form the main staging point for raids and are therefore located at a convenient point in or near the territories the band frequently raid. A corsair base located on an unpopulated world usually indicates an abandoned base but some corsair bands prefer to locate their bases a safe distance away from the regions they attack to reduce the chance of retaliation.

Naval (G): Vargr naval bases are much the same as their human counterparts, providing the same facilities and services.

Coexisting Bases (CG): Vargr place little emphasis on territory so it is possible for a naval base to coexist with a corsair base on the same world. However, this arrangement usually exists where the corsairs raid outside the borders of the local government and some authorities even encourage such activity if it is directed at rival governments.

#### TRADE AND TRAVEL

Travel Zones The Vargr do not have travel zones, nor do they recognize them. Danger varies from world to world but due to the lack of centralised control and authority in Vargr space, there are no warnings or classifi cations to indicate the level of danger individuals might face on a particular world.

However, for Imperial citizens travelling in the Extents, all Vargr worlds are considered Amber Zones until its safety to humans can be assured. Worlds can also be designated as Red Zones as required by the Referee, especially those with a law level of 10 or more and on Balkanised worlds where civil wars are not uncommon. Imperial classifi cations serve only to warn travellers entering Vargr space; there is no interdiction from the Imperium or the Vargr prohibiting travel, but such worlds are deemed hazardous to non-Vargr.

Interdiction is rare in the Extents and largely incompatible with the Vargr mindset; not only is there little motivation to set or enforce such rules but very few Vargr would actually abide by them. Further to this, what might be dangerous to one Vargr individual or group might not be to another depending on their charisma, beliefs, subspecies or a variety of other factors.

Starports A class X starport indicates that the world does not have a starport or does not allow interstellar contact. This can be for any number of reasons including isolation, xenophobia, destruction of starport, collapse of local government or lack of population.

Trade Codes Trade codes are the same as on human worlds. However, worlds with a balkanised government (type 7) can never have the Rich (Ri) classifi cation.

Travel and Trade Routes As with so many aspects of the Vargr, their communication and trade routes are constantly changing as corporations, governments and even corsair bands rise and fall. For this reason, such routes are rarely indicated on subsector maps unless it is an established route with a stable government and society.

The Vargr do not have anything that approaches the x-boat network. The lack of centralised authority and the constant fl uctuations of borders and leadership make such an undertaking impossible to establish in the Extents. Private couriers and corporations specialising in communications are used by to perform these tasks but such companies are only as stable as the governments and corporations that hire them.

In order to maintain their sphere of infl uence, large governments establish their own communication networks. Without a reliable system of communication these governments would soon lose their infl uence over the people within their borders.

## GGVVURRDONURRDON SSEECTORCTOR

Gvurrdon Sector is dominated by numerous Vargr governments and it borders with both the Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate, resulting in a region of diverse cultures, political unrest, volatile trade and frequent raids. Such a place might seem chaotic and unstable to Imperium and Zhodani citizens, but to the Vargr it is simply their way of life.

The sector is part of the Vargr Extents, spanning the coreward and trailing quarter of the Gvegh-Aekhu region. There is a good mix of both the Gvegh and Aekhu cultures but the coreward strip consists primarily of Gvegh Vargr.

#### HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE

As anyone with an understanding of the Vargr would expect, Gvurrdon sector has had a turbulent and violent history. Countless empires have been established over the centuries, only to collapse with the formation of rival governments. Charismatic leaders have swung the balance of power and mighty nations have fallen with weak leadership. Many of these nations have been forgotten over the centuries but the most powerful and notorious empires have been recorded in the annals of history.

The Ancients The Ancients are known to have been active in Gvurrdon sector and there are several sites where the ruins of this mysterious race have been discovered along with remnants of their technology, notably in Ongvos, Adhsakh, Kfan Uzangou and Llanic subsectors.

Most evidence of the Ancients would suggest that they primarily inhabited or visited the spinward region of Gvurrdon sector but what activities they conducted here remains a mystery.

The Vargr Diaspora Much of Gvurrdon sector was colonized by the Vargr during the Vargr Diaspora that began in –3782. The Vargr trait of moving on when their situation is unsatisfactory was increased further by the promise of new resources and trade (or plunder in the case of the corsairs).

The fi rst nations were small, chaotic and unstable with many dying out or becoming decivilsied. At the height of the Vargr Diaspora, around –3000, worlds in the central and coreward subsectors were suffi ciently advanced to build their own ships to trade and raid with neighboring systems. It was around this time that the more powerful and established governments started to take control over larger territories and some eventually

expanded their sphere of infl uence to a subsector level or greater.

By –2500 the most notable power was the Khouktae Empire, which controlled most of Dzen subsector and several border worlds in Uerra Rueshken. The Khouktae Empire remained the largest and greatest power for over 50 years until a new power began to emerge in Kfan Uzangou subsector.

Gvurrdon Pact Around the year –2700 the government on Gvurrdon established a pact with a number of neighboring worlds and governments. The Gvurrdon Hvaek (Gvurrdon Pact) maintained this loose alliance and slowly grew until the year –2480 when Gvurrdon's leader Serratogz was deposed by prince Knurroe, a charismatic and well-respected individual.

After a short period of successful rule, Knurroe acquired a new streamlined Zhodani ship. Vargr starships of this era were unstreamlined vessels capable only of Jump-2 but the alien ship was a streamlined vessel capable of Jump-3. Knurroe's scientists reverse engineered the alien starship giving him a great advantage over other Vargr in the sector.

Several years later Knurroe tightened his grip on the Gvurrdon Pact and began to expand his empire using his new starships, eventually spanning the central subsectors and absorbing neighboring governments such as the Khouktae Empire. Just like other Vargr nations, the borders of Gvurrdon Pact were in a state of constant fl ux but it remained the largest Vargr empire at that time and gave its name to the sector.

The Second Diaspora Although the Vargr Pillaging that began in –2400 did not take place in Gvurrdon sector, it was the catalyst for the Second Diaspora that rippled throughout the Extents. By the time the Diaspora reached Gvurrdon sector its effects were much less pronounced than the First Diaspora, resulting in minimal expansion. However, with Vargr settlers on the move, many citizens of the now stagnant Gvurrdon Pact joined their brethren and settled on new worlds. The once great empire was in decline and by the year –2300 its reign had ended.

The power vacuum left by the collapse of the Gvurrdon Pact resulted in the formation of numerous new governments. Many attempted to seize control of old Gvurrdon Pact territories but there was fi erce competition from like-mined rivals. New nations rose and fell with increasing regularity but none had managed

to control a signifi cant territory for any length of time. Eventually the sector stabilized with governments' content to retain control of a single world or system.

Toward the end of the Second Diaspora, a surge of new Vargr settlers came into Gvurrdon sector and two new nations began to gain power.

The fi rst of these came from humble beginnings by establishing a mining colony on Tirrokoelaegz in Ksits Usathu subsector. With the discovery of several lanthanum deposits, the colony became rich and powerful. Mines in neighboring systems were taken over and around –1800 the Zaegou Federation was established. With such vast resources the empire grew rapidly and soon controlled much of the subsector.

Whilst the Zaegou Federation was taking control of Ksits Usathu subsector, numerous corsair bands with ships crammed full of loot had set course for the spinward sectors of the Extents where they could make new homes away from the war-torn borders of the Vilani Empire.

A very charismatic and skilled corsair leader called Rasorrorr was uniting these corsair bands to operate under his banner in Spurl subsector. Not only did he provide good leadership and many victories, he also organised the groups under his command to defend their newly taken worlds and territories.

As Rasorrorr's infl uence spread more colonies came under his control and Rasorrorr eventually declared himself a prince, naming his new empire Raso Gatsdzo. Although this new empire never grew beyond the boundaries of the subsector, it had a strong military consisting largely of corsair groups. After Rasorrorr's death the empire declined until a new leader called Kaekranak was able to take power in –1769.

## The Gvegh Wars
For nearly a decade, Kaekranak strengthened his empire and expanded into [[Uthe subsector]], encroaching on the borders of smaller nations. At the same time, the Zaegou Federation was expanding in all directions into neighboring subsectors, absorbing smaller states into its territories. Both empires were spreading into Uthe subsector where they were destined to clash.

Leaders of many small states in Uthe saw the two approaching nations as a threat and formed the Uthe Alliance. Other small alliances also formed along the borders of the Zaegou Federation and Raso Gatsdzo empires. Hostilities along these borders were inevitable and eventually resulted in the Gvegh Wars, which took place from –1760 to –1620. Full details of the Gvegh Wars can be found in the History chapter on page 51.

Following the Gvegh Wars, Gvurrdon sector enjoyed nearly 50 years of peace before the Vargr returned to their usual confl icts and struggles for power. However, this time governments were kept in check by neighboring states, preventing the growth of larger empires. Apart from minor skirmishes and corsair raids, Gvurrdon sector remained largely uneventful for over 2,000 years.

The Thoengling Empire In 792, changes in the small state known as the Thoengling Raghz (Thoengling Empire) led to more militant policies and a new era of expansion. The Thoengling Empire soon conquered every world in the subsector and renamed it Thoengling.

With control of the subsector, the Thoengling Empire had become a major power in Gvurrdon and used its infl uence to establish trade agreements with the Imperium. The Thoengling Empire was the fi rst Vargr nation to openly embrace the Imperium and by doing so they had gained a powerful ally.

The Thoengling Empire now had a fi rm hold in the Extents and continued to expand its borders, albeit at a slower pace so as not to overextend itself. The Empire grew to dominate Aelluekh subsector and several subsectors in Tuglikki sector.

Society of Equals The expansion of the Thoengling Empire had fi nally ended the stagnation of the last two millennia and paved the way for other nations to follow suit. However, since so many other governments had failed to take control of more than a few systems, in 831 the Dzen Aeng Kho (Society of Equals) adopted different tactic. They had already established power on several worlds in Dzen subsector and built up strong trade routes between them. They had been the victim of frequent corsair raids so the leaders built up a small naval fl eet to protect the merchants and their goods.

Using safe and strong trade relations as their bargaining power, coupled with the right for governments to retain local control, several neighboring worlds were convinced to join the expanding empire. As the Society of Equals was growing, there were no large governments to contend with so absorbing new worlds was usually quite effortless. Most governments saw the benefi ts of belonging to the Society of Equals so military force was rarely required.

The nature of the Society of Equals meant that their expansion was slow. They crept from system to system without causing wars or political hostilities. Worlds that came under their control remained much the same but enjoyed a greater protection from any would-be attackers. The Society of Equals now spans seven subsectors and is the largest empire in Gvurrdon sector.

New Empires While the Society of Equals was expanding in central Gvurrdon and the Thoengling Empire was growing in the trailing subsectors, other new empires had also started to form. Some, such as the Pact of Gaerr, had started out as alliances formed in response to the fast-expanding Society of Equals. Other nations like the Thirz Uerra (Thirz Empire) had simply gained enough strength and power to retain control over their territories.

As new empires were being established throughout the sector, the usual hostilities began. Several wars broke out but these did not last long – the smaller states were simply no match for the larger empires. Many worlds within Ongvos and Zoghz subsectors lacked the strength to resist any would- be conquerors. Only the Gvuksdourrgh government had the military might to stand against the encroaching empires and formed the Seaknouth Igz (Seaknouth Dependency) in 1039 to protect Gvuksdourrgh and its trading partners. With fi nancial support from the member worlds, Seaknouth's power and infl uence grew to encompass nine worlds.

Many worlds within Ongvos and Zoghz subsectors lacked the strength to resist any would-be conquerors. Only the Gvuksdourrgh government had the military might to stand against the encroaching empires and formed the Seaknouth Igz (Seaknouth Dependency) in 1039 to protect Gvuksdourrgh

and its trading partners. With fi nancial support from the member worlds, Seaknouth's power and infl uence grew to encompass nine worlds.

The formation of these large and powerful empires encouraged other governments to form new alliances as powerful nations were being established throughout the sector. Of course, many worlds were also determined to remain independent.

The Age of Rukh More than any other individual, the well-known leader Rukh has had a major infl uence within Gvurrdon sector and his empire, the Rukh Aegz (Worlds of Leader Rukh) was founded in 1058. Rukh was not only an extremely charismatic leader but a skilled tactician and experienced raider. After uniting several corsair bands on Orra, Rukh soon gained a loyal following. His leadership was legendary and many corsair bands signed up to fi ght alongside the mighty Rukh.

Under his guidance, Rukh's forces conquered neighboring worlds and his empire swiftly expanded. Within fi ve years he had amassed a large military force and ruled half the subsector, naming it after himself. A decade later his empire spanned four subsectors and consisted of nearly 30 worlds, becoming one of the major powers in Gvurrdon sector.

As the expansion of the Worlds of Leader Rukh threatened to dominate Spurl subsector, several governments united in 1069 to form the Gnoerrgh Rukh Lloell (Anti-Rukh Coalition). The leaders of these six worlds in Spurl subsector had no desire to become part of Rukh's empire; with Rukh's fl eet spread over four subsectors the combined forces of the Coalition were able to defend their territories and maintain their independence from Rukh's infl uence.

Uthe subsector was largely ignored by the Worlds of Leader Rukh due to the presence of the 40th Squadron. Likewise, expansion in other directions was restricted by other large nations.

Rukh died in 1097 in an assault on the Zhodani world of Khoeghersaeng in Kfan Uzangou subsector. Many attributed this to his age – Rukh was 59 when he died on the front lines but the battle was still won. After Rukh's death, the empire went through a short period of unrest and several worlds declared their independence. However, once Rukh's son Rraedzou came of age he seized control of the government. Following in his father's footsteps he displayed remarkable leadership and charisma, regaining the loyalty of his father's followers and stabilizing the empire once more.

The Zhodani Zhodani explorers were fi rst encountered in Gvurrdon sector around –2800 but it was several centuries until the Consulate started to establish colonies in spinward region of the sector. During the Second Diaspora many Vargr settlers were attracted to worlds near the Zhodani borders for trade and raiding opportunities. There was a period of hostility between the two races, largely due to the corsair activity, but once the Zhodani made a show of force against piracy most corsair bands stopped raiding Zhodani worlds more peaceful relations were established.

First contact between the Vargr and Zhodani in this region took place during the Vargr Diaspora. Many Vargr settlers were attracted to worlds near the Zhodani borders for trade and raiding opportunities. There was a period of hostility between the two races, largely due to the corsair activity, but once the Zhodani began to understand the Vargr more peaceful relations were established.

Piracy has always been an issue but Vargr emissaries have usually been effective in maintaining reasonable relations with their Zhodani neighbors. The Thirz Empire in particular has had long standing trade agreements and has been greatly infl uenced by their Zhodani neighbors, especially in the fi eld of psionics.

The Imperium The Imperium has had little infl uence in Gvurrdon sector. Indirectly, the Vargr Pillaging that took place in the trailing

region of the Extents resulted in colonists and corsair bands resettling in this sector but historically the Imperium has not had a signifi cant presence here.

Human settlers and traders have long been travelling to Gvurrdon but their Imperial status means little in this sector. Most humans that have made their homes here have had to adjust to the Vargr way of life.

More recently the Imperium has begun to take an interest in this region of the Extents as Imperial concerns in the Spinward Marches now border with Gvurrdon sector. Only a few worlds have had enough human population and infl uence to become client states of the Imperium.

#### STATES AND PEOPLES OF GVURRDON

Gvurrdon sector is divided by a variety of subsector-wide empires, system-wide nations and small states controlling single worlds or continents. The most powerful and dominant governments are detailed here, together with some of the smaller states of note.

Referees should note that the political borders presented here are a snapshot of the Vargr Extents in the year 1105. The borders and political status of the Extents are in a constant state of fl ux, so travellers should be aware that the governments of systems and worlds they have previously been to might be quite different on subsequent visits.

40 th Squadron The 40th Squadron (Ekhlle Ksafi ) was the only unit in the Ngoerrgh Togzekhz fl eet to survive the Battle of Zivije near the end of the First Frontier War. Led by Commodore Koudvan the 40th Squadron fought their way back home, only to discover their nation immersed in a civil war.

Koudvan had little respect for the leaders of the warring factions and with the support of his squadron he conquered a cluster of worlds and established a feudal state under military rule. The empire ruled for fi ve centuries with varying degrees of success but the 40th Squadron itself remained the driving power. With assistance from the Zhodani military, the Squadron navy is one of the most effective fl eets in Gvurrdon sector.

The state is governed by offi cers from the 40th Squadron and still uses the same ranks and military discipline established during the First Frontier War. The crew of each ship has a high degree of camaraderie, even for Vargr, and mates are sought from other ships within the fl eet, resulting in a distinct and closed culture who spend most of their lives in space.

The 40th Squadron currently controls six worlds in Uthe subsector with the capital based on Uthith. Although the worlds are governed by planetary leaders, the real power of the nation comes from the ranking offi cers onboard the ships who hold regular inter-ship councils and meetings with the governors.

More recently on the systems of the 40th Squadron, civilians have become disaffected with their governments. Several worlds have seen the rise of rival factions and other local governments have had to relax their regulations to keep the populace in line. However, the naval fl eet maintains its reputation and is the glue that continues to hold this nation together.

Anti-Rukh Coalition The Anti-Rukh Coalition (Gnoerrgh Rukh Lloell) was the fi rst coalition to take a stand against the Worlds of Leader Rukh.

Unlike other nations bordering the Worlds of Leader Rukh that are content to maintain a defensive position, the Anti-Rukh Coalition takes a more active role against the Worlds of Leader Rukh.

The two rivals are always considered to be in a state of war and hostilities between the two empires never cease. Border skirmishes are frequent and local corsair bands are encouraged to raid worlds within the Worlds of Leader Rukh territories. The expansion of the Worlds of Leader Rukh may have slowed since the death of Rukh, but the empire continues to conquer neighboring systems, albeit at a slower pace.

Commonality of Kedzudh This coalition was formed in 1044 to help prevent piracy in Firgr subsector. At this time many worlds had fallen victim to raids by the Kforuzeng corsair band and nine governments signed up to form this loose alliance. Worlds in the Commonality gradually built up their naval fl eets, largely supplied by the Rrakhthall Shipyards on Ughz, and eventually grew strong enough to curtail the activities of the Kforuzeng.

The Commonality has limited control over its worlds and is viewed as a smaller and weaker version of the Society of Equals. Governments within the Commonality retain their autonomy but pay a small amount of tax to the Commonality to help support the police force and small navy fl eet. The powers of the law enforcement division are limited to preventing piracy and related crimes such as black market goods and contraband.

The government only has one naval base, which is based on the capital of Ughz. From here, the fl eet patrols trade routes within the Commonality's borders. Any suspected corsair vessel is boarded and searched. If a vessel is caught in the act of piracy, the navy will attempt to disable the vessel before boarding. If the suspects are determined to be guilty, they are arrested and charged.

Any illegal or stolen goods found by the navy are confi scated and used to help fi nance the fl eet. This does not sit well with merchants who want their goods back but they are permitted to appeal within one week of the goods being impounded. Nearly a third of the navy's funding comes from these seizures and many citizens suspect the navy of seizing vessels that are totally innocent to help fi ll the coffers.

Nation of Urukhu The Nation of Urukhu controls four neighboring systems in Fanganger subsector, commonly referred to as the Urukhu Cluster and another world just two parsecs away. The Nation once consisted of seven worlds but two broke away in 1084 to form the Fanganger Federation. Prince Urukhu rose to

power 25 years ago on the capital of Kaekfesa and became a well-respected leader. Vargr living under his rule have few restrictions as long as they pay their taxes.

Trade between member worlds is a thriving business and this small nation has become self-reliant. With the four worlds coexisting so well and supplying the nation with everything it needs, trade from other sources has all but dried up. In recent years the Nation of Urukhu has become more insular as few outsiders visit the Nation and its citizens have little desire to leave.

Citizens are happy in their jobs and Urukhu remains a popular leader. The few Vargr that become dissatisfi ed with Urukhu's rule usually emigrate to one of the worlds in the Fanganger Federation. However, with so much of the nation's success being dependent on the charisma and infl uence of Urukhu, once he dies, or is no longer fi t to rule, the continued stability of these worlds is unlikely.

Pact of Gaerr Gaerr was a charismatic leader who ruled the planet Roedz in Zoghz subsector. With new governments forming and empires growing, Gaerr soon realised that if he was to continue his rule he must expand his sphere of infl uence. However, the leaders of nearby systems were also very charismatic and it was clear that no single individual would rise above the rest to rule outright. The solution was to form the Pact of Gaerr, whereby member worlds committed to a mutual defence pact. Gaerr had the most powerful navy and constructed a naval base as a staging area for the combined forces to repair and refuel.

The Pact of Gaerr now includes 16 worlds spanning three subsectors. Governments within the Pact have no restrictions forced upon them and no taxes are levied. The only requirement is that each member world must deploy at least 20% of their military to the combined taskforce based on Roedz. The combined military forces are commanded just like any other Vargr pack and have successfully repelled many attacks and corsair raids.

Seaknouth Dependency Many worlds within Ongvos and Zoghz subsectors had enjoyed healthy trade relations for several decades and the Seaknouth Dependency (Seaknouth Igz) was founded in 1039 to ensure continued trade between these worlds by protecting them against the threat of rival empires.

Member worlds are still dependent on the Seaknouth Dependency for protection and all trade within the borders is

taxed to fi nance the military. The taxes fl uctuate depending on the current political climate. In periods of relative peace the fl eet patrols are reduced accordingly but as hostilities increase, so do naval activities and the costs to support them.

The Seaknouth military is primarily focussed on defending against rival governments and for the most part offi cials are indifferent to piracy and related activities. However, if frequent raids start to threaten trade then the navy will actively hunt any corsair band operating in Ongvos and Zoghz subsectors that are suspected of raiding member worlds.

Society of Equals The Society of Equals (Dzen Aeng Kho) is a coalition of more than 50 worlds that dominate the central subsectors of Gvurrdon. The Society of Equals is not a government in the typical sense and it does not directly rule any region. It is often likened to the Imperium in that each government is free to rule their own states as they see fi t.

The seat of power is based on Oesar Gin, a centrally located world in Dzen subsector (see page 139 for details). From here the empire expanded over seven subsectors, including control of every system in Dzen and most of Iz Therrg.

Much of the success of the Society of Equals is that it has always had charismatic leaders. As the empire expanded its borders, most worlds accepted rule by the Society of Equals. Those that initially refused were soon swayed by a combination of charisma and political pressure. The fact that governments are able to retain their rule with so few limitations is also an attributing factor to the continued success.

The leaders are well aware that their people can be easily dissatisfi ed, so for the Society of Equals to maintain its control it has had to impose few laws on its members. If too many regulations were enforced, most governments would declare themselves independent, which could also result in hostilities. For such a coalition to work with Vargr the benefi ts must outweigh the restrictions and costs, which is certainly true in the case of the Society of Equals.

The Society of Equals is primarily built on free trade between member worlds, which are encouraged to foster trade relations with other member states – with the exception of locally determined contraband, embargos between member worlds are forbidden. Refusing trade of legal goods from another member imposes fi nes and in rare cases has resulted in a hostile takeover of the government by Society of Equals forces.

Although trade between member worlds is encouraged, trade with non-member states is forbidden except for essential imports that have limited availability within the empire; trading such items requires a licence and goods undergo thorough inspections. The purpose of this is to strengthen the empire whilst encouraging non-member worlds to join so they can gain the trade benefi ts – this is an effective strategy and many border worlds have been forced to sign up with the Society of Equals to continue trading with member worlds.

Trade with non-members might be restricted but with so many ships coming and going, it is easy to get unlicensed goods past customs for people with the right skills and knowledge. Smuggling can be a profi table business in the Society of Equals but the penalties range from imprisonment to starship confi scation, depending on the amount and type of goods being smuggled.

To ensure that interstellar trade thrives between member worlds the Society of Equals have established naval bases on a number of worlds, not only to protect against rival governments but also to prevent unauthorized piracy within their borders. The Society of Equals does not tolerate piracy and unauthorized raids are dealt with harshly. Raids on non-member worlds are permitted and sometimes encouraged against rival governments to help gain the loyalty of new members.

The Society of Equals has almost grown to its limits, surrounded on all sides by the most powerful nations within Gvurrdon sector. The neighboring empires will not join the Society of Equals so the government maintains strong diplomatic ties with all its neighbors to prevent hostilities – nearly half of all emissaries in Gvurrdon sector are in the service of the Society of Equals.

Thirz Empire Even before the Thirz Empire (Thirz Uerra) seized power in 889, there was a strong Zhodani infl uence on many of its worlds. Psionic training became more commonplace than on most Vargr worlds and a number of psionic institutes have been established within the Empire.

The Thirz Empire had amassed a strong navy and soon dominated Uerra Rueshken subsector and neighboring systems. Expansion to trailing was blocked by the territories of the Society of Equals and the Zhodani Consulate prevented further expansion in other directions.

As the Empire grew it became increasingly diffi cult to maintain the loyalty of its citizens, so much of the governments control now comes from secret operatives (many of them psions) who blend into society looking for signs of insurrection. Any potential dissidents are arrested and re-educated using techniques learnt from the Zhodani. However, this system is not infallible and uprisings have been known to occur, especially on the border worlds.

Although the government is often lacking in strong leadership it maintains healthy trade agreements with the Zhodani and most Vargr merchants lead wealthy lives. This is the main strength of the Thirz Empire and Vargr corporations here tend to be more successful and longer lasting due to the presence of the Zhodani and their stable economy.

Thoengling Empire The Thoengling Empire (Thoengling Raghz) is a large centralised state that spans Gvurrdon and Tuglikki sectors. It has existed in its current form since 792, making it one of the largest and most stable empires in Vargr history.

An elected Assembly votes in each Emperor who serves in his position for life with has great power and authority but by law, no family member may succeed him. The Thoengling Empire has a nobility class where sons and daughters of the nobility are educated by the imperial court, brought up to be loyal to the Emperor.

The Thoengling Empire is a militant power that controls all law enforcement and military within its borders. Loyalty of the lower classes is maintained by charismatic and skilled leaders from the higher nobility,with punishments for disloyalty being swift and harsh.

To help retain control over member worlds, trade permits are required for both offworld traders and those merchants wishing to export outside the Empire. However, permits are rarely refused and most worlds enjoy healthy trade relations with corporations inside and outside the Thoengling borders.

The stability and infl uence of the Thoengling Empire has made it a powerful nation and a major trading partner of the Imperium and is a strong supporter of Imperial interests in the Extents.

Worlds of Leader Rukh The Worlds of Leader Rukh (Rukh Aegz) is still ruled from the capital of Orra by Rukh's son, Rraedzou. The empire currently controls nearly 30 worlds spanning four subsectors. In order to maintain such a large empire, heavy taxes are levied on all worlds within its borders. Law enforcement remains at a local level but military is owned and run by the main governing body based in the capital.

There is a lot of corruption in the Worlds of Leader Rukh. Bribes are made to offi cials to avoid certain taxes and charismatic individuals can talk their way out of most potential problems and fees. Uprisings are also common throughout the empire but are usually quelled by the military before they gain too much support.

To reduce any dissident movements within the military, individuals are paid and treated well. Piracy and related crimes

are tolerated so most Vargr remain loyal but mutiny is punishable by death.

The Imperium In a region dominated by the Vargr, the Imperium has found it diffi cult to gain control of worlds in Gvurrdon and have so far only managed to establish two client states – one in Uthe subsector and one in Firgr with a naval base and scout base respectively.

The purpose of establishing an Imperial presence is two-fold. The Imperium still views the Vargr as a potential threat – with so many powers within the Extents all vying for control and the continued raids from corsairs, the Imperium fears a second Pillaging. By establishing Imperial settlements within Vargr territory they serve as observation posts that can give advanced warning of any large naval movements.

Further to this, the Imperium hopes that by establishing good trade relations with the Vargr and by showing military strength in the form of naval and scout bases, that the Vargr will be less likely to attack Imperial territory. Thus far this has worked and the two Imperial controlled worlds in Gvurrdon see very few corsair raids within their borders.

The Zhodani Consulate The Zhodani Consulate controls most of Llanic subsector and several worlds in Kfan Uzangou and Ongvos subsectors. The Zhodani have benefi tted from continued trade with most Vargr in the sector and enjoy strong relations with the Thirz Empire.

Many Vargr worlds along the Zhodani border have had varying degrees of infl uence from their Zhodani neighbors, especially where psionics are concerned. Most of the Vargr psionic institutes are found in the spinward subsectors of Gvurrdon.

Unfortunately, much of the trading and good relations have been soured by Vargr corsairs, particularly in Llanic subsector where there are no large Vargr governments to suppress raider activity. Although the Zhodani here have come to understand the Vargr, they still fi nd it diffi cult to determine if the corsair raids are sanctioned by local governments or if they are carried out by independent groups.

The frequent corsair attacks have ignited many political misunderstandings and have led to hostilities on numerous occasions. Vargr emissaries are repeatedly dispatched to Zhodani worlds to help keep the peace and resolve any issues between the two races.

In recent years, the discovery of several Ancient sites by Vargr settlers has become a matter of interest to the Zhodani. Delegates from the Consulate are in continued negotiations

with the respective Vargr governments to examine and study the Ancient sites and technology.

Minor States Most of the remaining governments (of which there are many) have no infl uence outside a single star system, with most being confi ned to a world or continent. Those that have expanded their sphere of infl uence to other systems are detailed here.

Church of the Chosen Ones: This religion (see page 35 for details) controls two worlds in Dzen subsector, operating within the Society of Equals. The government is funded by collecting regular tithes from the Church's faithful followers and residents, so there are no taxes on Aegadh. This is very appealing to many who live here but those who do not follow the faith simply see the tithe as another form of tax (which it is).

The local law enforcement has a strong presence on worlds run by the Church, with all transgressions being dealt with in a swift and severe manner. Any activities deemed to be working against the beliefs or goals of the Church are not tolerated. To maintain this edict, the police can be very intrusive into business and personal affairs; all incoming and outgoing trade is subject to thorough searches and anyone suspected of acting against the interest of the Church is detained and investigated.

There are actually very few activities that are considered a threat to the Church and despite the police intrusion the population enjoys a great amount of freedom. Suspects are well treated by the police and as long as citizens abide by the law they live relatively happy lives.

Fanganger Federation: The Fanganger Federation (Fanganger Kunkouag) consists of two states in Fanganger subsector that broke away from the Nation of Urukhu as it became more and more isolated. Both worlds, Ozago and Ngersouluekorruk, maintain strong trade routes to most independent states within three parsecs.

There are no rules or laws imposed by the Federation – the alliance is little more than a trade agreement and mutual defence treaty.

Free Trader's Enterprise: The Free Trader's Enterprise
(Ghongdhou Kuezgho) was formed in 1063 by two corsair bands in Ongvos subsector. The group has bases on Tarraekhs and Llaegh but they never raid their homeworlds. Over time the corsairs became well respected by many of the locals.

The Free Trader's Enterprise eventually seized control of Tarraekhs and Llaegh, a move that was welcomed by most citizens who had become dissatisfied with their previous leaders. Much of the government's finances are supplemented by sanctioned raiding – this policy has

made the Free Trader's Enterprise unpopular with nearby governments and hostilities towards the Free Trader's Enterprise are on the rise.

Corsair Raiders The following are the most notorious corsair bands known to operate in Gvurrdon sector. Some of the smaller and less well known groups are also listed and would rival any new bands that operate in their territory.

Aegzaeng: The Aegzaeng are an independent corsair band that are particularly skilled at ground assaults. They are known to many worlds and are actually involved more in legitimate mercenary work than piracy. In 1105 the group joined the powerful Kforuzeng band where they now operate as the primary ground assault unit.

Dhangfa: The Dhangfa has a base on Ksaghae in Ongvos subsector but to avoid confl ict with the Free Trader's Enterprise, the band raids worlds in Zoghz subsector. This has worked to their advantage as the governments there do not suspect that pirates attacking their worlds originate in a sector where corsair activity is primarily controlled by a governing power.

Gvankfarraegh: The Gvankfarraegh corsair band operates in Spurl subsector and has two bases there. Many raids undertaken by the Gvankfarraegh are funded by the Anti-Rukh Coalition and directed against the Worlds of Leader Rukh. The Worlds of Leader Rukh have been unable to hunt down the pirates who continue to elude the Rukh navy.

Kaerrgga: The Kaerrgga operate out of a base on Sagukhunngo in Adhsakh subsector. They tend not to raid small states, preferring to attack the more profi table worlds in the neighboring empires of the Society of Equals and the Pact of Gaerr. When patrols are increased in these territories, the Kaerrgga will head further afi eld and raid worlds in the Thoengling Empire and occasionally against the 40th Squadron.

Kforuzeng: The Kforuzeng are the largest and most powerful corsair group in Gvurrdon sector and were formed in 1041. They are based on Oertsous in Firgr subsector and primarily operate along the Deneb border where they currently monopolise all raider activity. The band is well known to all navies and traders who frequently travel the region.

Llangzoekirs: This corsair group operates in Aelluekh subsector and comprises of a number of smaller bands working under the command of a feisty Vargr female called Ongaegzlla. As the Llangzoekirs corsairs gain power, more bands fl ock to Ongaegzlla's banner. The Llangzoekirs corsairs currently control four bases in Aelluekh subsector and will soon be large enough to spread out into neighboring subsectors.

Llanic Raiders: The Llanic Raiders are a secret coalition of corsair bands that operate in Llanic subsector. Collectively, this

group controls all corsair activity in the subsector but is organised in such a way that very few people even suspect the group exists. With careful organization the Llanic Raiders spread their attacks to avoid drawing too much attention to specifi c areas

and when government patrols are increased to combat local piracy, the corsairs simply focus their raids elsewhere.

The Raiders operate out of Uenag and are led by Zakskhsakrsa. Zakskhsakrsa is the governor of Uenag and leads the Visorz, who are the most powerful band in the group with a sizable fl eet of four corsair ships and nine scouts.

Ongkae: The Ongkae are becoming a rising power in Ongvos subsector. They operate out of a base on Zaerrg and are fast becoming a rival to the corsair bands of the Free Trader's Enterprise. Uthfoaek: The Uthfoaek are a recent arrival in Ksits Usathu subsector and have already made a name for themselves against their rivals, the Zollanngougz. There have been numerous confl icts between these two groups and hostilities continue to rise, threatening the stability of Ksits Usathu subsector.

The Uthfoaek have recently established a base on Dzenzaega, bordering the Society of Equals territory. With the construction of their base the Uthfoaek are sending a message that they are here to stay, effectively declaring war against the Zollanngougz.

Zollanngougz: The Zollanngougz are a large corsair group lead by a charismatic individual called Tsuetsae. Under Tsuetsae's command, the Zollanngougz has absorbed several smaller corsair bands and the group now owns two bases in Ksits Usathu subsector.

Until recently, the Zollanngougz monopolised corsair activity in Ksits Usathu subsector but the arrival of the Uthfoaek has altered the balance of power. These two groups are now at war with each other.

#### WAR

Gvurrdon sector, and indeed most of the Vargr Extents have had a long history of war. Some are little more than border skirmishes, whilst others have lasted decades or even longer. The Vargr mindset and way of life is such that they will never become a single unifi ed empire; charismatic leaders and dissidents always emerge to seize power or start a new nation, and the sheer number of different governments and states means that wars are inevitable.

Most subsectors in Gvurrdon experience confl ict between their numerous states and there is usually a war occurring somewhere in the sector. Details of these confl icts are given in the relevant sections for each subsector later in the chapter.

Conflict As growing Vargr empires expand their borders, hostilities usually escalate. There is rarely a period within Gvurrdon where a Vargr confl ict is not in progress or about to happen. When war breaks out between large nations it can have a devastating effect on smaller states caught in the crossfi re, whereas wars between single worlds or systems often go unnoticed by the rest of the sector.

Whilst some wars pass without having much impact, some confl icts can bring about huge change on a subsector or even sector level. Trade routes become supply lines vulnerable to attack and corsair activity usually increases. Temporary alliances often form between smaller states in the hope that their combined forces will be enough to defend against larger nations. Corsair bands and mercenary groups are also hired to help bolster military forces.

Civil wars are also common in Vargr governments. The Vargr are easily infl uenced by charismatic leaders who spark military coups and dissident movements that rise up and challenge their current leadership. Large governments tend to crush uprisings fairly quickly but this is not always the case if the right individual is leading the revolt. Quite often there is no clear victory and a second rival state emerges creating a balkanised government.

It is clear then that the Vargr are constantly at war with themselves, but what about other races that inhabit or border Gvurrdon sector?

The Imperium Since the Frontier Wars, there have not been any major confl icts between the Vargr and the Imperium. Although the Imperium has a small presence within Gvurrdon sector itself, they do control a number of the border worlds in the Spinward Marches. Wherever there are Vargr there is always the potential for confl ict and if a war were to happen, it would take place along this border.

The two Imperial client states that are situated in Gvurrdon sector have varied relations with their Vargr neighbors and inhabitants. Corsair raids are rare against these systems, largely due to the Imperial bases located on each world. Much the same can be said for the worlds in the Spinward Marches that border Gvurrdon sector. However, corsair raids are more frequent in areas that are not patrolled regularly.

Most of the rimward worlds of Gvurrdon are independent states and show no signs of immediate expansion – the closest empire is the 40th Squadron and that government has remained relatively stable for 500 years with no signs of extending their borders.

Imperial attitudes toward the Vargr vary considerably. There are many who associate the Vargr with the Julian Wars, and more recently fi ghting alongside the Zhodani in the Frontier Wars. However, others also recall that the Vargr also fought alongside the Imperium and that the Julian Wars were primarily a human versus human confl ict.

Relations between the Vargr and Imperium might be peaceful but the Imperium are well aware of how quickly Vargr governments can change. Any empire expanding in the rimward subsectors of Gvurrdon would be cause for concern and the client states that have been established in two of these sectors serve as advanced warning posts should any nation threaten the Imperium.

The Zhodani The Zhodani Consulate has maintained their borders in Gvurrdon for over 2,000 years and are likely to keep them for another 2,000. The Zhodani have mixed feelings toward the Vargr; on the one hand these races have had good trade relations since the fi rst Vargr settled here during the Diaspora but on the other hand the Zhodani have been victim to numerous corsair raids and border skirmishes.

The formation of the Outworld Coalition during the Frontier Wars did much to strengthen Vargr-Zhodani relations but this only accounted for roughly half of the governments and corsair bands that bordered Zhodani territory.

The Thirz Empire has maintained good relations with the Zhodani for two centuries and has done much to suppress

piracy against both nations. Emissaries are also on hand to resolve any political confl icts that might occur.

Unfortunately, relations between the Zhodani and the Worlds of Leader Rukh are not so good. The expansion of the Worlds of Leader Rukh might have slowed but the proximity of these two nations in Kfan Uzangou subsector is the cause of frequent hostilities. Piracy is commonplace in this region with raids conducted by both corsairs and the Rukh navy.

The Worlds of Leader Rukh is a powerful empire and the leader Rraedzou sees the use of emissaries as a sign of weakness, so diplomatic relations simply do not exist. Several of the independent states in Kfan Uzangou subsector fear that if a war did break out they would be caught in the middle or chosen as viable targets by the Worlds of Leader Rukh to establish bases and staging points. These small worlds do not have the resources to become embroiled in a war. To help prevent hostilities between the Zhodani and Worlds of Leader Rukh, the independent states have a number of ambassadors to the Zhodani whose sole purpose is to keep the peace.

Llanic subsector has similar problems between the Vargr and Zhodani. Corsair activity and raids against Zhodani worlds are as much a problem here as in Kfan Uzangou subsector. However, since the subsector has only independent Vargr worlds it is diffi cult to identify the source and cast blame. In many ways this is more diffi cult for the Zhodani as they have no legitimate target to seek recompense or retaliate against.

#### TRADE

Whilst the constant confl icts and hostilities in Gvurrdon sector cause problems for the Vargr and to a lesser extent the Zhodani, many Vargr would argue that the lucrative trade between all these races and nations is something worth fi ghting for.

Most Vargr governments actively trade with other states but embargos are usually put in place between rival or warring factions. Several isolationist groups also exist who refuse to trade with outsiders but such Vargr are rare – only the Nation of Urukhu has sustained such a way of life.

With the exception of the Worlds of Leader Rukh, all of the Vargr governments located near Zhodani worlds trade with their human neighbors. The Thirz Empire in particular has many successful partnerships and trade agreements with the Zhodani. A lot of trade is also done between the Vargr and the Imperium, with most Vargr merchants based on worlds in Uthe and Firgr subsectors trading with worlds in the Spinward Marches.

#### CORPORATIONS

The following corporations and organizations exist within Gvurrdon sector. These represent some of the most well known and infl uential organizations although many similar ones exist throughout Gvurrdon and the Extents.

Dhirrsak's
(Vargr Subsector-Wide Corporation) Dhirrsak is a junk dealer who started his business on a highly populated world. With so many businesses starting and failing there was a huge market for second hand goods and Dhirrsak capitalised on this. Although other junk dealers operated on Gaelaeth, Dhirrsak had a grander plan and his business guile meant that his company soon grew into a large corporation.

Dhirrsak's now has dealerships on two other worlds and continues to expand. With the corporation's wide network of dealers and contacts, Dhirrsak's has coverage over a wide area where they can quickly buy up goods from failing companies.

Home Port: Gaelaeth. Territory: Ksits Usathu subsector.

Dzofakael
(Vargr Sector-Wide Corporation) This corporation is a manufacturer of heavy equipment and ship armaments. Many Vargr ships, including navy and corsair vessels, are armed with Dzofakael weapons and protected by their armor. Dzofakael's other products are primarily aimed at the mining industry and their bulldozers, drillers and even locomotives are used by numerous mining colonies.

Home Port: Ikkhadzkfaghukh (Thoengling subsector). Territory: Gvurrdon sector.

Gvaeknoks
(Vargr Sector-Wide Line) Gvaeknoks are one of the largest Vargr shipping lines operating throughout Gvurrdon sector. They have a fl eet of jump-2 traders and jump-3 transports that provide merchant services to every world within the sector. The corporation has maintained political independence from Dzen Aeng Kho despite being based in the government's territory.

Home Port: Kfolaell (Rukh subsector). Territory: Gvurrdon sector.

Kaengvarrg
(Vargr Sector-Wide Corporation) Kaengvarrg runs a number of psionic academies spread throughout Ongvos, Uerra Rueshken, Kfan Uzangou and Llanic subsectors. Many of their institutes

are located in the Thirz Empire but some are also situated on independent worlds.

Kaengvarrg academies are the most renowned psionic institutes within Vargr space and of course the most expensive. Sponsorships have been given on rare occasions but only when the student is exceptionally gifted. The academies primarily cater to Vargr students but other races have been known to be accepted. However, positions are limited and Vargr will always take precedence over anyone else.

Home Port: Gvurrdon (Kfan Uzangou subsector). Territory: Gvurrdon sector.

Krazdo Ashsanzh
(Zhodani Subsector-Wide Corporation) Krazdo Ashsanzh is one of only a few Zhodani corporations based on a Vargr world. This company is based on the neutral world of Tsukifi and provides a psionic investigation service. Krazdo Ashsanzh has become quite renowned in the Thirz Empire and the psionic investigators are often utilised by the government and large corporations who need specialized agents for numerous tasks.

Home Port: Tsukifi. Territory: Uerra Rueshken subsector.

Lorkan Kfoeng
(Vargr Sector-Wide Corporation) Lorkan Kfoeng is an independent law enforcement agency that hires out experienced and professional agents to the government and corporations. Lorkan Kfoeng has an excellent reputation within the Society of Equals and is located on the empire's capital. Agents are hired by the pack and are generally used as a temporary solution to bolster existing police forces or to command them in areas where the existing law enforcement is ineffective or lacking.

Whenever large events require additional security or a political situation develops on a world within the Society of Equals, units of Lorkan Kfoeng will often be deployed. Not only are the Lorkan Kfoeng agents well trained and good at their job but the fact that they are independent of local governments also helps, especially when dealing with political situations.

Home Port: Dzuerongvoe (Dzen subsector). Territory: Society of Equals territories.

Nenngos Goukae
(Vargr Subsector-Wide Corporation) Nenngos Goukae
(Nenngos Mining) are the largest and most successful mining company based on Saezghen (see page 134). The corporation was founded by the Nenngos family and has endured the wars and hostile conditions of Saezghen for generations.

Nenngos Goukae control the largest continent on Saezghen, which is reputed to have the richest deposits on the entire planet. Numerous other deposits also fall within the territory of Nenngos Goukae and they currently have seven active mines and four ore refi ning facilities in operation.

Home Port: Saezghen. Territory: Uerra Rueshken subsector.

Sakh Karrgnor
(Vargr Subsector-Wide Corporation) Sakh Karrgnor was established on Kaeg by two brothers who sensed an opportunity with the vast amounts of wreckage and damaged equipment left by the war that occurred there. The brothers formed a new corporation and claimed salvage rights to most of the unpopulated wastelands. Their business soon prospered gaining them much respect and loyalty from local communities, which ultimately made them rulers of Kaeg.

This growing corporation now trades refurbished second hand equipment with many worlds in Fanganger subsector.

Home Port: Kaeg. Territory: Fanganger subsector.

Sueklloukhkna
(Vargr Sector-Wide Corporation) Sueklloukhkna is the largest courier service within the Thirz Empire and are based on the capital. They operate much like the Imperial X-Boat network but on a smaller scale. The corporation has extensive communication routes within the Empire with less frequent communications to Zhodani worlds. The latter are used primarily for diplomatic communiqués.

Home Port: Uthgvoe (Uerra Rueshken subsector). Territory: Thirz Empire.

Rrakhthall Shipyards
(Vargr Subsector-Wide Corporation) Rrakhthall Shipyards started as a family run business in 897. Collectively, the family had amassed a considerable fortune, which they invested in the construction of a modest shipyard and a skilled workforce. They started building small craft primarily for military use and established trade agreements with several governments in nearby systems.

As Rrakhthall Shipyards fl ourished, the corporation built new facilities to develop and manufacture different types of components for larger vessels. Even after the deaths of the founding members, their legacy lived on – Rrakhthall Shipyards was instrumental to the success of the Commonality of Kedzudh, with many of the Rrakhthall starships being used to combat the activities of the Kforuzeng corsair band.

Home Port: Ughz. Territory: Firgr subsector.

Rraegnaell Oukh
(Vargr Interface Line) Rraegnaell Oukh is a shipping line that is based just three parsecs away from Zhodani space and only fi ve parsecs from Imperial territory. They maintain successful trade routes between Vargr, Imperial and Zhodani interests and frequently trans-ship goods that are otherwise forbidden to be traded directly between these governments.

Home Port: Dhaengae (Spurl subsector). Territory: Gvurrdon sector and Spinward Marches.

Vun Nez Onorka
(Vargr Corporation) This academic institute specializes in law and politics. Vun Nez Onorka is well known for instilling

discipline in its students, something that does not come easily to Vargr so only the very best graduate. However, those that are successful become distinguished amongst the diplomatic and legal communities.

Vun Nez Onorka is also known for its strict dress code and most Vargr who receive their qualifi cations continue to wear the adornments of Vun Nez Onorka in their professional careers. This is especially true of those trained to be emissaries who often adorn themselves with tattoos and sigils as a sign of their reputable education.

Home Port: Torrrrerz (Firgr subsector). Territory: Torrrerz.

Walker Robotics
(Human Subsector-Wide Corporation) This corporation is based near the border of the Spinward Marches on a world with a sizable human population. Walker Robotics specializes in quality human-built robots aimed at the Vargr market (in both form and function). The corporation has a large facility where robots are designed and constructed. From here they are shipped out to Vargr merchants and distributors.

Although there is not a huge demand for robots in Vargr space, Walker Robotics' products are superior to Vargr made equivalents and thus have extremely high profi t margins. The main rivals of Walker Robotics are the corsair bands that steal Imperial-built robots and sell them in Vargr space.

Home Port: Pandrin. Territory: Uthe subsector.

Zhosokh Urs
(Vargr Corporation) Zhosokh Urs is a guild of highly qualifi ed and respected emissaries. They established their own school called Tsu Thoezhou (Honored Gate) but due to fi nancial diffi culties it was closed down in 1104. Graduates are easily identifi ed by their right ear, which is clipped to signify the 'well respected ear' where the guild gets its name.

Many would argue that those trained with Zhosokh Urs excel even beyond those schooled at Vun Nez Onorka but this is very much open for debate (and often is). That said, Zhosokh Urs emissaries are just as sought after for their integrity and professionalism.

Home Port: Aetskaekhoun (Aelluekh subsector). Territory: Aetskaekhoun.

Other Corporations Akerut and Oberlindes are both shipping lines based in the Spinward Marches and trade with the border worlds in Gvurrdon sector. Details of these corporations can be found in The Spinward Marches.

#### ONGVOS

Ongvos subsector is dominated by three major governments – the Zhodani, Thirz Empire and Seaknouth Dependency – each controlling roughly the same amount of worlds. Surrounded by these four empires are a number of independent states and the small corsair-run government, Free Trader's Enterprise. The Society of Equals also has a small presence controlling a single world in the subsector.

Relations between all governments, both large and small, are relatively peaceful except for the independent corsair raids and those sanctioned by the Free Trader's Enterprise. The Ongkae are the only other corsair band known to be operating in the area and are fast becoming a rival to the activities of the Free Trader's Enterprise.

Most governments enjoy mutual trade agreements with each other but by edict of the Society of Equals, trade within their borders is restricted to member-worlds only. Relations between the Society of Equals and Thirz Empire can be quite volatile –the border worlds frequently change allegiance through uprisings or border wars.

There are two worlds in Ongvos where Ancient ruins and technology have been found. This is the only subsector where more than one Ancient site has been discovered, suggesting that the Ancient activity was focussed in this subsector. However, with so few Ancient sites discovered throughout Gvurrdon sector this is largely speculation.

Enjtodl C8A8100-8 Enjtodl is a Zhodani military outpost with minimal support facilities for the orbital naval base located nearby. From Enjtodl, the Zhodani are able to protect the other two Zhodani worlds in the subsector from potential attacks and corsair raids.

The starport is manned by a skeleton crew and is primarily used as a checkpoint for supplies being delivered to the base.

Travellers are permitted to use the facilities for a modest fee but access to the naval base is strictly limited to Zhodani military personnel only and any vessel that strays too close will be warned – should the warning go unheeded, any unauthorized ship will be fi red upon and boarded.

Tarraekhs B000657-C Tarraekhs is a large asteroid that was originally colonized by prospectors around 300 years ago. The natural cave network within the asteroid was easily converted to a pressurised mining facility. The settlement soon grew as miners and traders made their home within the complex.

The facility continued to make high profi t yields for over 100 years until the mineral deposits ran out. With so many people now out of work, many of the miners left to fi nd new jobs but some remained with the other inhabitants to start new careers. Although the asteroid had been mined out, the facility had become a thriving trade hub with nearby systems and its popularity continues to this day.

More recently the corsair group known as the Free Trader's Enterprise established a base on the asteroid and have since formed their own government, making Tarraekhs their capital. To increase the loyalty of their people and to protect their territories, the Free Trader's Enterprise does not permit raids within its borders – this ensures safe trade for all merchants who continue to use the facility.

Laws are fairly relaxed on Tarraekhs but surprisingly for a world run by corsairs, it is illegal to carry any weapon except blades and stunners. The reason for this is two-fold. Firstly, the reputation of the Free Trader's Enterprise attracts many corsairs and criminal types so restricting weapons allows the government to protect its people. Secondly, it helps foster the image to outsiders that the government does not sanction violent actions (even though it does).

Llaegh B638359-9 Llaegh is a medium-sized world with nearly 80% of its surface covered by vast oceans. The population of around 6,500 people live in small pressure-domes with many of them connected to the starport by transport tubes.

Each dome has its own small community consisting of numerous packs. Within each community there is always one dominant pack who takes leadership of that dome. Each community trades with neighboring domes, which has created a self-suffi cient society. The inhabitants only trade with neighboring systems for luxury items and technology that is unavailable locally.

Although the system of government remains the same, Llaegh is now controlled by the Free Trader's Enterprise. Life on Llaegh has remained much the same but with the presence of

the corsair base the people here gain the protection of their new ruler and for the most part have welcomed the pirates to their world.

All weapons are banned on Llaegh for the same reasons as on Tarraekhs. Just as on the capital of the Free Trader's Enterprise weapons stowed on starships are perfectly legal, they just cannot leave the ship.

Roeknughroe B100A99-C Roeknughroe is a small moon rich in lanthanum. With such a valuable resource, Roeknughroe became a key system for the Thirz Empire and once they had conquered the small population a naval base was established here.

The Thirz Empire poured a lot of resources into Roeknughroe as the lanthanum supply was essential to their expansion during the late 800s. A network of pressure domes were built on the moon's surface, each supporting underground mining facilities and ore processing plants.

Conditions were poor but the pay was good and the population of miners and those in supporting roles grew at an exponential rate. More domes were built to house such vast numbers but on such a small moon conditions are overcrowded and space is at a premium.

The cost of living on Roeknughroe is high (+25% to all list prices when purchasing goods and services) but so is the pay (+50% of typical pay rates). Vargr who come to Roeknughroe tend not to last long in the cramped and fast paced way of life but most are able to save a decent amount of money to start new ventures elsewhere.

In order to keep the facility secure and prevent the lanthanum from being smuggled or stolen, Roeknughroe has very strict laws governing most types of possessions. All weapons and drugs are illegal. Offworlders are not permitted and any Vargr wishing to work or trade at the facility must undergo background checks before being given a license.

Torrvagve A577226-C Situated between the worlds of the Free Trader's Enterprise is the sparsely populated world of Torrvagve. Although the world is run by an independent government there is a strong presence by the Church of the Chosen Ones who were drawn here by the discovery of some Ancient ruins in the northern polar region.

The Church was quick to establish control of the area and remain an independent state from the main ruling government. The nature of the ruins is known only to followers of the Church who worship the site rather than study it. The Zhodani Consulate

have long tried to convince the Church of the Chosen Ones to allow Zhodani scientists and experts access to the Ancient ruins but all requests have been denied on the grounds that it would be sacrilege to allow non-believers access to such a holy place.

Fearful that the Zhodani or Vargr organizations might one day attempt to use force to gain access to their revered 'temple', the area is well protected by security guards and defence systems.

Dzukoun B788899-7 Dzukoun is a water world located in Seaknouth Dependency territory. The oceans are teeming with sea life and microscopic nutrients, which has attracted numerous fi shing communities and mining corporations with advanced water fi ltration technology capable of extracting minerals from the seawater. Both of these industries have yielded substantial profi ts making the government and citizens of Dzukoun very wealthy.

Recent underwater surveys have revealed some alien technology buried under the ocean fl oor. Many believe this was built by the Ancients and is responsible for the rich waters of Dzukoun. The government lacks the expertise to study the device but are currently in negotiations with the Zhodani who will pay handsomely to examine the Ancient technology. How much access and what rights they have is yet to be determined but both parties are excited by the opportunities a successful agreement could bring.

#### ZOGHZ

Much like its spinward neighbor, Zoghz is dominated by three major governments – the Seaknouth Dependency, Pact of Gaerr and Society of Equals. A single border world of the Thirz Empire cuts into the Society of Equals territory giving the Thirz Empire some small infl uence in the subsector. Situated between these empires are four other minor states.

Hostilities between governments are minimal and are usually sparked by corsair raids that have yet to be tracked back to their source. Unknown to the governments is that the raids are actually being conducted by the Dhangfa corsair band based in Ongvos subsector. Relations between the Society of Equals and Thirz Empire remain the same here as in Ongvos subsector.

Onllae Roungo A886633-9 Onllae Roungo was fi rst settled during the Second Diaspora. Its rich and fertile soil made it perfect for the colonists to farm animals and grow food to feed the increasing population. Unlike some Vargr agrarian worlds where the population spreads out, the people of Onllae Roungo settled in four main regions. It was in these locations that four cities emerged, each home to roughly two million inhabitants.

Populated primarily by Vargr of the Gvegh culture, confl ict was inevitable. Each city was a power in its own right and desired leadership of the entire planet. Numerous wars followed but eventually the Seaknouth family emerged victorious and their descendants still rule today. Unfortunately, the hostilities did not stop there and Onllae Roungo has been subject to several uprisings and civil wars but the Seaknouth family have always maintained control.

In later years when the world was threatened by larger powers, the people of Onllae Roungo became more unifi ed. The formation of the Seaknouth Dependency in 1039 helped to solidify the nation further with the pride of being the capital world of a larger state. However, even now there are signs that the people of Onllae Roungo are beginning to return to the old ways.

Taekfoengsegzo B866569-9 Taekfoengsegzo is an agrarian world that has suffered a typical Vargr history of violence, multiple governments, confl ict and uprisings. The fi rst Vargr settlers established a small city during the Second Diaspora and the population soon grew to numerous cities and farmsteads scattered around the planet.

Once the Society of Equals' infl uence had spread to Zoghz, Taekfoengsegzo lost its major trade routes to worlds that joined the expanding empire. Eventually the government had no choice but to join the Society of Equals to save the failing economy of Taekfoengsegz. Although the renewed trade helped to stabilize the government, a separatist movement was gradually gaining support.

After several failed uprisings, the separatist movement have recently hired mercenaries and corsairs to seize control of the government and declare independence from the Society of Equals. The majority of farmers and merchants openly criticized the move to independence, forcing the new government to declare martial law. Strict laws remain in effect, isolating Taekfoengsegzo and its citizens.

The new leader Garogh certainly has charisma but her lust for power has blinded her to the reality of the situation and the new captive government now faces threats both foreign and domestic. The produce of Taekfoengsegzo was important to the Society of Equals and it is likely that they will eventually take action to claim back this world, knowing that much of the population will support the move. Closer to home, remnants of the old government will undoubtedly attempt to regain control of their world.

Luerrgnudhlaerz B657337-7 Luerrgnudhlaerz is a large planet with a population of just over 3,000 people spread over two core settlements, which are both located near the starport. Most of the trade and services provided here are to serve the needs of the naval base that was estab- lished to protect the Society of Equals worlds in this subsector.

Luerrgnudhlaerz is a recent acquisition by the Society of Equals and the Earth-like conditions make it an appealing location for many Vargr. As word begins to spread of this world, more and more Society of Equals citizens are warming to the idea of settling here where they can start new lives and begin new ventures.

A steady stream of new arrivals has begun to arrive on Luer- rgnudhlaerz and locals predict that this world will soon be trans- formed into a thriving Vargr society.

Uekongull A779324-E This high-tech world consists largely of oceans with several archipelagos. This unusual world is home to around 4,000 Vargr spread over the tiny islands in small communities.

Situated on these islands are a number of academies, libraries and research institutes that attract Vargr scholars and intellectuals from all over Gvurrdon sector – Uekongull is now commonly referred to as 'the world of thinkers'. A substantial amount of new Vargr technology is conceived on Uekongull and the think tanks and schools are now funded by the Seaknouth Dependency and private corporations.

Offi cials in the Seaknouth Dependency hope that advances made on Uekongull will help strengthen their military and improve the lifestyle of their citizens.

Kukhvu A000422-F Kukhvu is a high-tech orbital facility that was built shortly after the Seaknouth Dependency was established to serve as the

government's primary shipyard. Since its construction it has been upgraded several times as new advances in technology have been made.

In addition to constructing and repairing the mainstay vessels of the Seaknouth navy, new designs are also prototyped here
(many of which originate on Uekongull). Kukhvu is defended by a small fl eet and a substantial defence grid. Many of the ships being worked on can also be called into service if need be.

Rinvoengerrazo C11077B-A Rinvoengerrazo is an independent state located between the major empires of the subsector. It is a desert world that was settled by miners just over 100 years ago who established a small city contained within a pressure-dome. The natural resources of this world were spread thin so the starport was constructed some distance away from the city in an area that had no mineral deposits.

Several decades later a mining corporation built a new facility in direct competition with the original settlers. What followed was a period of continued hostility between the two factions with numerous confl icts and bloodshed. Control of the planet and the starport has changed frequently over the years as new leaders take power.

Rinvoengerrazo remains a volatile world but its central location makes it a popular hub for trade in the subsector. With such an unstable government, interstellar trade has become essential to maintain the economy and apart from periods of intense

hostilities and unrest the local laws are usually quite lax, making it a popular stop off point for smugglers and corsairs.

Roedz A585575-9 Since the fi rst settlers made their home here after the Gvegh Wars, Roedz has been an agrarian society. Much of the land is given over to farming turrvagh and other animals but other foods are also grown. The planet has a population of 300,000, most of which live in small communities near the farms.

As more Vargr came to Roedz a few confl icts broke out but nothing on a large scale and differences were often settled by one group moving to a different location. Even today there is still plenty of room on Roedz for the relatively low population that live on the world.

During the development of the world, several small cities have been established to meet the growing needs of the population and to support the starport, which has continued to grow. The many farms operating throughout Roedz produce far more food than is needed by the population and it has become their main export.

In the early 900s, Roedz was ruled by the reputable leader Gaerr who formed Pact of Gaerr. The Pact was primarily a mutual defence treaty with neighboring worlds. Since Gaerr was the most charismatic leader and also had the largest navy, Roedz became the capital of this new coalition and a naval base was built as a central point of operation and maintenance.

Roedz remained a single state until two years ago when several factions within the government were unhappy with the current leadership. Taxes had reached an all-time high and too many demands were being placed on the farmers. Emissaries were called in to mediate the dispute but a compromise could not be reached. Eventually, two of the continents broke away and declared themselves as independent states.

With all trade and travel restricted across the world, the new factions have had to build their own starports to trade with other worlds. The ruling government remains but the other factions are gaining support, with each one vying for leadership of the planet and control of the main starport.

#### ADHSAKH

Adhsakh is dominated by the Pact of Gaerr who control four worlds covering nearly half the subsector. The Society of Equals has a small presence controlling two worlds in the rimward region. The rest of the subsector consists of independent states.

Adhsakh sees less raiding against independent worlds but the Kaerrgga corsair band is known to raid worlds inside the borders of the Pact of Gaerr and the Society of Equals. However, this

does not make it any less dangerous for travellers – two worlds that were members of the Pact of Gaerr have recently had signifi cant changes in leadership with the new governments declaring themselves as independent states.

With two new militant and volatile governments, Adhsakh subsector has become unstable and potentially hazardous to traders and travellers. Many systems have seen a drop in trade and visitors to their worlds.

Okfitos B000641-9 This asteroid was of little interest until a Vargr prospector discovered the remains of a small alien base deep inside. Upon further examination, scientists deduced that it was Ancient in origin and served as some sort of secret base or outpost – the most common theory being that the facility was an observation post but an agreement has not been reached on what the Ancients were observing.

The Pact of Gaerr quickly built a research facility on the asteroid. They brought their best scientists and Ancient experts to study the remains and hopefully learn its secrets. The asteroid has come under attack at some point in its history and parts of the Ancient base are damaged or buried beneath cave-ins. Extensive excavation is required to further investigate these areas.

These Ancient ruins are known to only a few people within the Pact and the facility appears as a standard scientifi c laboratory. Outwardly it looks quite innocent but it is defended by a number of hidden weapons and starships.

Tanga B9C56BB-9 Tanga is a large volcanic planet. Volcanoes of varying sizes are located all over the planet spewing toxic and corrosive chemicals into the air and poisoning the ground. The large oceans consist mostly of molten lava and the skies are fi lled with a black acrid fog.

Most people would ask why would anyone come to such a world, much less live on it, but the answer is simple. Money. And with money comes power, infl uence and charisma – qualities that all Vargr crave.

Contained within the lava fl ows are a number of rare and valuable substances used in high technology weapons and equipment. When prospectors fi rst discovered the riches to be had on Tanga they knew it would be diffi cult to establish mining facilities in such harsh conditions but they never could have imaged the loss of life that would follow.

During the excavation of the fi rst settlement, over 100 Vargr lost their lives. Some were careless and fell into the lava fl ows but most deaths were due to equipment failure – anything exposed to the elements on Tanga simply could not endure the insidious atmosphere. Vacc

suits leaked, air supplies failed and vehicles broke down and nearly every time this happened it resulted in casualties.

Eventually, the equipment was improved and modifi ed to better withstand the conditions here and the fi rst subterranean settlement was eventually completed, incorporating housing, mining and refi ning facilities. The money soon fl owed as quickly as the lava and more underground settlements were excavated under the planet's surface.

Even with better quality equipment. Exposure to the surface climate is limited and in order for the population to endure life on Tanga, numerous recreational facilities were constructed within the underground settlements and they soon became as loud and garish as any other Vargr community.

Mechanics and engineers are always in high demand on Tanga and they are well paid for their services. Trade is also important for spare parts and replacement equipment – so great is the demand that many junk dealers sell exclusively to settlements on Tanga.

Until recently, communities on Tanga have enjoyed good living and a thriving trade. So harsh are the conditions here that disagreements beyond trivial Vargr infi ghting are very rare. The Tangan's are proud of their communities and what they have built. They value their independence highly and opinion has always been divided about joining the Pact of Gaerr.

Following the coup on Karrksinarka, the military on Tanga were inspired to follow suit and seized power, seceding from the Pact of Gaerr. This resulted in anarchy – citizens rioted, miners refused to work and engineers laid down their tools. However, the new government quickly took control using its military might to quell the riots and crush any opposition. A military dictatorship now rules Tanga and the money is starting to fl ow once more.

Ikhotakhang B668766-5 Ikhotakhang is a water world that is home to an indigenous race of reptilian sophonts. This race was fi rst discovered by the Society of Equals in 898 who named them Vozkell, meaning 'lizard people'.

The Vozkell The Vozkell have a humanoid physiology and typically stand fi ve to six feet in height. Their skin consists of tough scales (armor 1), which is usually green in colour but some have a yellow hue. Many Vozkell also have dark patches of browns and rustic colours. Vozkell have Notable Endurance (+1) and Weak Strength (–1).

The Vozkell are a tribal society that is not too far removed from the concept of the Vargr pack, although leadership is based on wisdom rather than charisma. They are a peaceful race and tend to remain with their tribe except when the males come of age – at which point they go out and seek a mate from another tribe and can only return when they have been successful. When a tribe grows too big it will eventually split into several smaller tribes, but remain part of the same clan.

The Vozkell are an agrarian race that uses technology sparingly. Most of their farming is done with traditional tools, very little machinery is used. Their buildings and structures are more advanced and typical of a TL5 society. Transportation is a mixture of horses and wagons, with the latter often made from a combination of metals and plastics. Perhaps the most obvious sign of their technology is their use of radio for long-range communication.

The Society of Equals was only interested in establishing a naval base here for its strategic location on the border. However, the Vozkell culture was so reminiscent of low-tech Vargr society that a signifi cant number of Vargr packs settled on Ikhotakhang to adopt a more traditional and down-to-earth way of life. The Vargr colonists remained separate to the naval base, visiting only to supply food.

Vargr packs and Vozkell tribes coexisted for nearly 40 years before the inevitable Vargr confl icts began. Three Vargr factions

formed, each competing for dominance and leadership. The Vozkell were caught in the middle of these confl icts and although they avoid hostilities where possible, they were forced to form their own government so their people had a voice.

Karrksinarka B886300-8 Karrksinarka was a thriving world with a population of nearly 100,000 people and was a member of the Pact of Gaerr since the state was founded in 945. In 1089 an infl uential naval offi cer called Kuengo openly criticized the government for its weak leadership and poor decisions concerning its military. Kuengo soon gained a strong following from his men and staged a military coup.

The result was a violent civil war that ravaged the world, killing thousands. Kuengo's forces eventually captured the naval base

- this attack cost many lives on both sides but many of the opposing military had a new found respect for Kuengo and changed allegiance. The government knew they had lost and fl ed Karrksinarka to make new homes on Gkakhaellan and Vorroeng. This was followed by a mass exodus of citizens that left fewer than 10,000 people on Karrksinarka, most of which are military personnel.

Karrksinarka is now an independent world and Kuengo is now in the process of forming a militant government. However, with so few citizens in his population he lacks enough resources to effectively support his military and maintain the economy.

The Pact of Gaerr and other neighboring worlds now fear Kuengo's next move as he has inherited a naval base and much of the Karrksinarka fl eet. He also has a loyal following and a need to support and rebuild his world – the most obvious course of action would be to begin raiding neighboring systems but Kuengo's agenda remains to be seen.

Sagukhunngo B995654-7 Sagukhunngo was one of the fi rst worlds to be settled in Gvurrdon sector during the Vargr Diaspora. Its early history is typical of many during that period with numerous factions vying for control of the planet.

The situation on Sagukhunngo took a turn for the worse when settlers discovered herds of turrvagh roaming the hills. The Vargr quickly acquired a taste for these creatures and it was not long before the turrvagh were hunted and farmed. New confl icts arose over hunting grounds and those that lacked the strength to take the animals by force resorted to turrvagh rustling (not an easy task).

Once enough of the creatures had been spread around the world, new farming communities and corporations emerged, and breeding programs were instigated. Confl icts over these valuable animals declined and a new era of cooperation began; faction leaders knew how lucrative the turrvagh would be on the

interstellar market and formed a new government to maximise their trade export.

Over the next century, herds of turrvagh were introduced to numerous worlds throughout the Extents and the people of Sagukhunngo lost their monopoly on the creatures. Sagukhunngo remains a farming world but it is not the hub of livestock trade that it once was. However, the Vargr that live and work the farms are still proud of their heritage.

Five years ago, the arrival of the Kaerrgga corsair band brought new opportunities to Sagukhunngo. The corsair base provides some protection to the population and also deters other pirates from raiding these territories. The Kaerrgga also trade much of their loot with the people of Sagukhunngo although they have been known to raid transports departing from Sagukhunngo that are known to contain valuable cargos.

To prevent such raids from occurring, a skilled emissary was able to negotiate a deal that was mutually benefi cial to both the Kaerrgga and people of Sagukhunngo. The government now pays the corsairs a reasonable fee in return for planetary protection and safe passage for all traders and starships within their space.

#### FANGANGER

Fanganger is perhaps the quietist and most peaceful subsector currently in Gvurrdon sector outside the Society of Equals territory. The largest power here is the Pact of Gaerr that currently controls six worlds. The Nation of Urukhu was once an equal and rival empire but their isolationism means they are of little concern to other states and much of their infl uence was lost when two worlds broke away to form the Fanganger Federation. The Thoengling Empire also has minimal infl uence with only a single world at the edge of the subsector.

Corsair activity is minimal in Fanganger and there are no bases or large bands that operate here. The Kaerrgga occasionally come this far when anti-corsair patrols in their home subsector of Adhsakh become too active. However, with the center worlds of the Nation of Urukhu isolated from the rest of Fanganger there is little interstellar trade worth plundering.

Kaeg D423412-7 Kaeg was once a thriving world of agriculture and trade. Factions within the balkanised government were in constant confl ict and their downfall came following decades of disputes over joining the Pact of Gaerr. In 1079 a civil war broke out that ravaged the planet. The war lasted several years until weapons of mass destruction were employed, which killed millions, levelled cities and contaminated the once fertile lands.

Devastated by the war, the survivors lived in poverty as their world lay in ruins. However, hope for Kaeg came when Sakh

Karrgnor was established – this corporation now runs the planet and is rebuilding the world and its economy, funded by selling the vast amounts of junk left behind after the war.

After Sakh Karrgnor came to power in 1086, they reinstated their position within the Pact of Gaerr and solidifi ed their position by establishing a small naval base. There is still much work to be done on Kaeg but with the help and support of the Sakh Karrgnor Corporation, the world will prosper once more.

Kaekfesa A997554-A Kaekfesa is the capital of the Nation of Urukhu and is situated centrally to the other three worlds of this isolated state. The Vargr on Kaekfesa are primarily of the Aekhu culture with many of the communities formed around family packs.

Most families live in farming communities, with the most dominant pack owning the farm and commanding the workforce. Neighbouring farms come under the jurisdiction of the most infl uential leader in that region and each region forms a separate faction within the Kaekfesa government. As is typical in these hierarchies, borders and ownership of each faction fl uctuates as charismatic leaders come and go.

Ngersouluekorruk A8AA432-C Ngersouluekorruk is covered almost entirely by water except for three small islands. It was fi rst colonized in 821 by several packs of rich Vargr who no longer wanted to be tied down by the trade restrictions imposed by the Society of Equals. Cities were established on two of the islands, with the starport being built on the third. A variety of gravitic vehicles provide transport between the islands.

The cities are protected from the atmosphere by high-tech pressure- domes. Lluzadhoe is a self-contained biosphere covering most of the island and is dedicated to farming and food production – both thakak and turrvagh were introduced to provide the inhabitants with a familiar diet. The abundance of marine life is also farmed from external facilities connected to the dome.

Naeza is the capital city and comprises of housing, commercial and recreational facilities. The quality of living is extremely high in Naeza due to most equipment being purchased brand new – the only successful junk dealers on Ngersouluekorruk are those that export used and unwanted items to other systems. Apart from the fact that Naeza still looks like a new city, it is in every other way typical of any Vargr settlement – garish ornaments and colourful markings decorate the buildings, the streets are fi lled with the sounds of haggling and arguments, and infi ghting breaks out amongst rivals.

Ngersouluekorruk has a population of 65,000 people and although all visitors are welcome, only the richest and most successful individuals are permitted to live or work here on a permanent basis. The inhabitants of Ngersouluekorr are elitist and enjoy nothing more than showing off their wealth, gaining the respect of their brethren.

In 1080 the government allied with the Nation of Urukhu for mutual defence. However, when the Urukhu isolationism began, Ngersouluekorruk joined the government of Ozago to form the Fanganger Federation.

Utsurr A550300-E Utsurr is a desert planet that was colonized during the decline of the Second Diaspora by a small religious cult. The Rarza

Thunkae (Seekers of Destiny) religion attracts the minority of Vargr who believe that because they were engineered from a lower life form by the Ancients, the Vargr are an inferior race. The interesting aspect of this religion is that it does not encourage the beliefs it was based on and the organization is based around the concept of proving one's worth as an individual.

In order to prove that they are worthy beings, members of the cult must face a number of trials designed to test their worthiness, pushing the very limits of mind and body – fasting, questing for inner wisdom or guidance, and tests of endurance all take place under the cruel heat of the deserts where only the strongest survive.

Although many would argue that these tasks are futile and unnecessary, the trials endured by Seekers are actually quite spiritual. Those who survive gain confi dence and self respect but they are not governed by charisma to the extent of other Vargr.

These traditions have continued for centuries and once an individual completes the trials they are essentially promoted from Seeker to Mentor, although there are no offi cial rankings. Mentors typically stay on Utsurr for one or two years helping out new Seekers before rejoining Vargr society on other worlds. Some mentors remain behind to set up small businesses to cater to the needs of other residents but there are too few to support the community – most food and equipment is supplied by merchants from nearby systems.

This curious religion has continued for 1,500 years and during this time the single settlement on Utsurr has evolved and expanded to the high-tech city it is now. Mentors live in luxury whilst Seekers endure hardships that threaten their very lives. There are numerous recreational facilities for mentors as well as places to learn and study.

New recruits must make a reasonable donation before a mentor is assigned to them. Most of the donations are used to support the population and maintain the facilities within the city. A small portion is given to the mentor as payment, which gives them enough funds to start a new life when they decide to move on.

With Seekers lacking self-esteem and so few mentors driven by charisma, very little infi ghting occurs on Utsurr. There is no government or law here as there is simply no need – most visitors are Seekers who have come only to endure the trials and prove their worth, or die in the attempt.

Ozago B431731-8 This dry and unfertile world was never planned to be colonized but during the First Diaspora a transport ship full of cryogenically frozen colonists ended its journey on this barren planet. The starship was only meant to refuel in this system but a problem

with the fuel processors prevented the vessel from reaching its intended destination. This region of space was sparsely populated and the hope of rescue was slim; the crew and passengers had no choice but to make their new home on Ozago.

The colonists split into many packs, each forming their own settlement. Tools and materials were limited – some packs built pressure domes, whilst others excavated subterranean settlements. Most groups were cooperative given their situation but some infi ghting broke out between rival packs.

Life was hard but most packs survived and built a home for themselves. It was over 200 years before any visitors came to Ozago and by that time communities had formed and the thought of leaving did not have the same attraction as it did upon their arrival.

The settlements grew as travellers came to join the communities and trade with them. When Ozago joined the Nation of Urukhu, trade increased and there was the potential for a better quality of life. However, the loss of trade during the Urukhu isolationism forced the government on Ozago to form the Fanganger Federation, making Ozago the capital of the new state.

#### UERRA RUESHKEN

Uerra Rueshken is dominated by the Thirz Empire that controls 13 worlds in the subsector. The Society of Equals has managed to secure two worlds on the trailing border. Relations between these two empires are the same as in Ongvos subsector (see page 122). The remaining three worlds are situated close to both borders and have all belonged to both empires at some point in their history but for now they maintain neutrality.

Corsair activity fl uctuates greatly in this subsector. A base is situated on Suedh that has been controlled by numerous corsair bands. Most raiders get greedy and attack trade routes within the Thirz Empire or Society of Equals. Corsair starships rarely survive such encounters as naval patrols are frequent within the borders of the Thirz Empire and Society of Equals.

Several notable corporations are based in this subsector including Krazdo Ashsanzh, Nenngos Goukae and Sueklloukhkna.

Kerkukhaeka B888554-B Kerkukhaeka consists largely of oceans with four main landmasses. The oceans are rich with nutrients that give rise to lush and fertile lands and an abundance of sea life. The world is sparsely populated with a number of small fi shing towns and farming settlements spread over two of the continents.

The other two continents are currently being occupied by immigrants from Saezghen. The Thirz Empire has funded

new housing, farms and workhouses to provide jobs and accommodation for the new inhabitants.

Saezghen B200A72-C Saezghen has seen a long and bloody history. Early settlers in 427 soon discovered that the planet was rich in natural resources and numerous Vargr packs and corporations soon fl ocked to Saezghen to establish mining colonies.

The population soon grew beyond the capacity of this small world, which sparked the beginning of a long series of wars. Many Vargr were killed during this period and it was only when the Thirz Empire gained control of Saezghen in 852 that a semblance of stability was introduced to the world.

The peace did not last long and in 856, hostilities began anew with armies clashing above and below ground where the most profi table mines were operating. The Thirz Empire now has a large garrison of troops on Saezghen who primarily serve as a peacekeeping force but outbreaks of violence are still a regular occurrence.

Although the Thirz Empire retains control of several continents, rival factions still fi ght for territories and the rich minerals contained within. Second to the Thirz Empire the most powerful faction is led by the successful mining corporation, Nenngos Goukae (see page 119).

The high population is still a major issue on Saezghen and the Thirz Empire is instituting new strategies in an attempt to reduce the population and stabilize the region. Inhabitants

are being offered free relocation to the neighboring world of Kerkukhaeka and ore refi ning facilities are being built on one of the orbiting moons to further ease the overcrowding.

The primary starport on Saezghen is located near the capital city controlled by the Thirz Empire. Due to the long history of hostilities between the factions here, Nenngos Goukae built their own class B starport central to their ore refi ning facilities. The Nenngos Goukae starport is available only to traders and shipping lines.

Zuts Asgning B43677B-B Zuts Asgning is located adjacent to the capital of the Thirz Empire and was the fi rst world to be conquered by the Empire, providing vital supporting services to the capital. It has had a history of confl ict common to most Vargr worlds. Major factions within the government still jockey for power and has led to strict law enforcement procedures that change as often as the controlling faction. The more dominant a faction becomes, it provides more important services to the capital.

Each faction supports the Empire but they all have the desire to be the ruling body and thus gain more power and infl uence. For the most part, this is a battle of charisma and leadership, with each faction leader attempting to win the support of the people. However, confl icts are not uncommon when the ruling faction refuses to step down to make way for more popular or experienced leaders.

These factions are also prone to fl uctuate as alliances form, uprisings split loyalties and military groups change allegiance.

At any one time, Zuts Asgning has 1d6 factions in addition to the current ruling body. As new factions seize power, laws often become more restrictive until the political situation stabilizes.

Uthgvoe A581466-B This dry world is the capital of the Thirz Empire and was the fi rst world to be conquered by the Empire. A base was constructed on Uthgvoe as primary staging point for Thirz military operations. Two new cities were built – Aknerdae is primarily for military personnel and Farsdullarrg caters for civilian interests, each home to around 10,000 Vargr. The Thirz Empire was keen to expand further and a number of additional facilities were built to train the growing military ranks.

Uthgvoe is also home to the main headquarters of the Sueklloukhkna Corporation. Sueklloukhkna are a courier service that operate throughout the Thirz Empire and maintain a strict position of neutrality, a policy that has kept the company in business for decades.

Tsukifi B97788C-8 Tsukifi is a large Earth-like world with a population of 500 million people. The majority of these are Vargr but there is also a noticeable portion of humans whose ancestors were brought here as slaves during the Pillaging. Slavery has long since been abolished on Tsukifi and the humans have integrated into the Vargr culture, established their own settlements or left for human space if they were able.

This part of Tsukifi 's history has been forgotten by most, allowing humans and Vargr to coexist in relative peace. Humans on Tsukifi tend to display Vargr traits and are treated as equals with some charismatic individuals even becoming pack leaders.

Also of historical interest is Tsukifi 's importance to the empire of the Gvurrdon Pact during its reign of power (circa –2700 to
–2300). Tsukifi is the only world within two parsecs of Gvurrdon
(Kfan Uzangou subsector), which made it an important trade hub for the capital of the Gvurrdon Pact.

Even after the decline of the Gvurrdon Pact, Tsukifi has maintained its role as a trade hub. The convenient and neutral position of Tsukifi has attracted a number of well-known corporations such as Krazdo Ashsanzh (see page 119).

Khaeknae B585898-9 Another world of historical interest, Khaeknae was once a border world at the edge of the old Khouktae Empire. The Khouktae Empire was eventually absorbed into the Gvurrdon Pact, which declined centuries later.

Numerous lanthanum deposits lay deep underground for thousands of years until prospectors loyal to the Society of Equals discovered them in 1021. Had this wealth of resources

been discovered by the Khouktae Empire, the history of that once proud empire might have been quite different.

Once the lanthanum discovery was made, the Society of Equals constructed mining facilities to extract the ore and refi ning stations to process it. Khouktae soon became a rich world and one essential to the continuing success of the Society of Equals.

The Society of Equals maintains constant patrols throughout the system to prevent attacks against their precious resource. The Thirz Empire has made several attempts to gain control of the planet but have failed each time. Corsair bands have also tried to liberate the shipments leaving Khouktae but they too have met with failure. Khouktae continues to produce a wealth of refi ned lanthanum and in addition to the naval patrols, the local government restricts all access to the planet to authorized personnel only.

#### DZEN

Every world within Dzen is controlled by the Society of Equals and this subsector is the heart of its empire. Hostilities arise between the many governments that rule each world but major confl icts are rare due to the mutual trade fostered by the Society of Equals.

Corsair raids are also uncommon due to the frequent patrols by the Society of Equals' naval fl eets. It is their presence that allows interstellar trade to thrive between member worlds.

Ngoerrgh E42065A-7 Ngoerrgh is a backwater world. It is of little interest except for the curious nature of the government who rely on computers to make all their decisions. Unfortunately, the relatively low-tech computers that they use often cause more problems than they solve. A higher level of technology would solve many of the world's problems but ironically such items are illegal in order to safeguard the government's control.

Although there is a single government in control of the planet each continent is ruled by a separate faction. These factions continually compete to become the ruling faction and success is largely dictated by the effectiveness of the technology, so much of their resources are invested into research and development. Some factions have even incorporated their computers into robots for both aesthetic and practical reasons.

Due to the importance placed on computers, all related technology is strictly regulated. Special permits are required to manufacture, distribute and sell most forms of technology. Ships entering and leaving the starport are also subject to random searches, especially fi rst time visitors. Any unauthorized technology is impounded and unless the owner can prove legitimate intentions, the confi scated equipment is sold on to

Vargr visiting Ngoerrgh fi nd it to be a peculiar world. Allowing computers to make decisions and rule a population is an alien concept to most Vargr and not one that is normally worthy of charisma gains and leadership. It is only in exploring the history of this world that this rather un-Vargr like behaviour makes sense.

Prior to the invention of computers, Ngoerrgh endured centuries of brutal civil wars. More so than most other Vargr worlds, Ngoerrgh experienced rapid changes in leadership that resulted from extremely poor leadership. Economies failed and the population lived in a state of war-torn poverty for so long that no individual had the skills necessary to stabilize the planet. Technological advancement was slow but eventually primitive computers were created and a charismatic leader named Korrgga saw an opportunity for change and a new era of peace on Ngoerrgh.

Korrgga was able to use his infl uence to call a truce where he convinced his rivals to use computers to aid in their decision making and avoid further confl ict. By adopting a feudal form of government each faction would retain control of their region. This solution was a bold move but one that made sense, allowing each leader to keep their position and charisma whilst accepting guidance from computers that were able to make informed and unbiased decisions.

To the amazement of many, this new system was successful and has remained for over 50 years. Whilst most factions continue to improve their computing and intelligence software, several factions are now turning away from their dependency on technology in the hope of leading their people in a more traditional manner.

Aegadh B737ADC-B Aegadh was the capital of the old Khouktae Empire before it was absorbed into the Gvurrdon Pact, which in turn collapsed around –2300. For over 3,000 years, the leadership on Aegadh frequently changed until the Church of the Chosen Ones (see page 35) founded a community here in 986 and established control of the planet. The Church has remained the ruling power despite numerous attempts to push them out of power by other factions.

Due to the government's power, Aegadh has become the primary branch of the Church of the Chosen Ones. The capital city, Errgkhourrraegh, is located 20 kilometers from the starport and is home to the Museum of the Supremacy of Vargr Culture. The museum is well known amongst the Church's followers and illustrates the history of the Church and the Vargr race
(as perceived by the Church of the Chosen Ones). Anyone is welcome to visit the museum – it is free to enter but a donation is expected.

Situated near the museum is a large temple and gardens; these facilities are collectively known as the Church District. This is a

signifi cant place for worshippers and the site has become the focus of many pilgrimages over the years.

Dzuerongvoe B664997-C Dzuerongvoe is a medium sized world comprised of roughly half water and half land. This geography and the standard atmosphere made it a perfect world for colonization during the Second Diaspora. Following the usual Vargr history of confl ict and war, a skilled and respected leader eventually established a stable government.

The population continued to grow and although numerous uprisings and bids for power occurred, the original government eventually reformed and took control. As hostilities began to escalate in the period following the Gvegh Wars, the government knew they had to establish a method of governing their growing empire and set in place the foundations for the Society of Equals with Dzuerongvoe forming the empire's capital.

With so many of the government's resources taken up with running the empire, the local leadership has become more isolated from the people of Dzuerongvoe. Ironically, uprisings and bids for power are more common on the nation's capital than on most other worlds within the Society of Equals. However, those that have been successful in seizing power soon fall victim to the same bureaucracy.

Dzuerongvoe is also the main base of operations for the Lorkan Kfoeng corporation (see page 119). This company is an independent agency of law enforcement specialists and their agents are used as much on Dzuerongvoe as they are throughout the Society of Equals.

Lling B561866-9 Lling is ruled from the neighboring system of Aegadh and has several unusual qualities. The fi rst is that despite being the planetary rulers, the Church of the Chosen Ones has little infl uence here. There are various communes located near the major cities but the presence of Church followers is relatively small in comparison to the planet's population. This is largely due to the fact that most worshippers would rather live on the capital than in a neighboring system.

The second unusual trait of Lling is that even though it is governed from a separate star system, there is little unrest from the population here. Many attribute this fact to the artistic nature of the society. Lling is known throughout the Society of Equals for its exquisite art, cultural traditions and lavish festivals. From laser sculptures to immense tapestries; the quality and variety of the artworks produced here have made Lling a rich and prosperous world. The frequent festivals held in all the major cities are popular with people of all races and draws many visitors to Lling.

Gaknau Val A98A614-9 Gaknou Val is governed by the Dzuous Gaknou Val Corporation, a successful company that trades fi sh and minerals extracted from the vast oceans and exports throughout Gvurrdon sector. With the exception of several satellite towns most of the six million inhabitants live in the single city of Errou, which is situated on a large island. The starport is located in the southern area of Errou and is easily accessible from the city and coastal facilities.

A short distance from the starport is a large Society of Equals naval base, conveniently situated on Gaknau Val so it lies between the highly populated worlds of Aegadh and Lloursouth. The primary function of the navy here is the prevention of unauthorized piracy within Society of Equals territory. Authorised raids also occur and the navy has even been known to engage in such activities from time to time.

#### IZ THERRG

Iz Therrg is dominated by the Society of Equals with their borders spanning 15 worlds in this subsector. Two border worlds of the Thoengling Empire are situated on the trailing edge of the subsector and fi ve independent worlds occupy the neutral territory that divides the two empires.

Confl icts are common in Iz Therrg. There is a continued rivalry between the Thoengling Empire and worlds of the Society of Equals, with both sides engaging in border skirmishes. The neutral corridor that runs through the subsector is in a constant state of fl ux as border worlds change allegiance or are conquered by the larger powers, only to declare independence when new leaders come into power.

Both the Thoengling Empire and the Society of Equals have naval bases on their border worlds. These bases are primarily used to support and maintain their fl eets patrolling the borders.

Due to the continued hostilities in this subsector, corsair activity is minimal. Many groups that have been established in Iz Therrg tend to get caught in the confl icts of the Thoengling Empire and the Society of Equals; most are hired by existing governments whilst the independent bands tend to get destroyed or forced out of the subsector.

Ghugi B686567-B Ghugi is an agricultural world. It has a population of just over 500,000, most of which are spread across the world in small farming communities. Many of these farms produce a variety of exotic spices which are reputed throughout the sector and beyond.

Ghugi was once a peaceful world inhabited by Aekhu Vargr who were content to live in small isolated communities centered

around the family pack. Each pack would farm and hunt for food and trade with their neighbors if necessary.

During the Second Diaspora, more Vargr settled on Ghugi and it soon became apparent that the locally grown spices would be profi table on the interstellar market. A new government was established, the starport was upgraded and the money began to fl ow.

Just over 20 years ago an individual named Salgvonzir, the leader of the most productive farm, wanted a greater share of the profi ts. Salgvonzir is a descendent of the Gvegh settlers and hired a large mercenary band to help him seize control of the government. With such small and isolated communities, the population are easy to control but Salgvonzir continues to use mercenaries to ensure he remains in power.

Gurzueng B788300-B Gurzueng has a population of roughly 2,000 people spread over two main cities and several small outlying communities. The capital city, Ekh, is situated near to the starport and the other city, Dzi, is located on a continent on the far side of the planet.

The majority of the population work in the silver mines located near each settlement. There are several rich deposits but the hostile winds that blow constantly throughout the world make mining a diffi cult and hazardous profession. Even with high-tech

equipment, ore extraction is a slow process but Gurzueng is slowly growing in size and building their economy.

Although Gurzueng has no government or law, it is a member of the Society of Equals and is therefore obliged to pay a share of their profi ts in return for the protection provided by the Society of Equals. This is a good example of how mutually benefi cial it can be for small independent worlds to be part of a larger empire; Gurzueng is vulnerable to raids on their silver ore so the cost of membership ensures they can continue to trade with little fear of attack.

Lloursouth A553A9E-C Lloursouth is another Vargr oddity. Despite the Vargr's reluctance for rules and regulations, the government on Lloursouth thrives on them. A variety of permits and licences are required for just about any activity including driving, fl ying, investigating, manufacture, medical care, entertaining, trading and salvage, the latter of which has caught out many junk dealers.

Permits are also required for the possession and trade of most items so the authorities can trace the ownership of goods such as various types of drugs, food, information, technology and weapons. This is another area where visitors fall foul of the complicated bureaucracy. Merchants need permits for every type of item they trade, in addition to their trading licence.

The demand for imported goods changes constantly but the stable prices on Lloursouth mean that traders can be certain of getting a good price if their goods are required.

The Lloursouth police have a special division to manage and operate the strict regulations. The Noghzo Khsuenue Darroerra (authorized goods division) spend the majority of their time making spot checks and inspections on merchants and civilians alike. The NKD have offi ces in every city and town where individuals and corporations can submit requests for new permits and renew existing ones. A large facility is also present at the downport where all incoming and outgoing cargos must be registered and are then subject to an inspection.

The reason for this overly administrative system is to prevent the market from being fl ooded with illegally obtained goods. In the past, the volume of illegal goods has resulted in a signifi cant economic downturn so the government instituted a system that allowed all goods and services to be tracked.

To begin with this system worked but the black market always found ways to bypass or forge the paperwork so a greater degree of administration was established. This cycle continued until the present system made it so complicated that it simply was not worth the time or effort to circumvent it. Although the population and traders have the inconvenience of so much paperwork and inspections, they do enjoy a stable economy that is rarely seen in the Extents. All equipment and goods purchased on Lloursouth are always sold at the list prices.

#### THOENGLING

With the exception of a single independent world, Thoengling subsector is controlled by the Thoengling Empire from where it gets its name. With the Empire controlling all military and law enforcement divisions within its borders corsair raids are rare, as are hostilities between Thoengling worlds. However, this does not suppress the natural Vargr desire for leadership and infi ghting – local governments change as frequently as on other Vargr worlds.

Knoerrgh E43099C-8 Knoerrgh is the only world in Thoengling subsector that is not part of the Empire. This has not been the case for its entire history and the Thoengling Empire has seized power on Knoerrgh several times. However, with the construction of a corsair base 25 years ago, Knoerrgh has remained an independent state.

Unfortunately, Knoerrgh is not without problems of its own. The local government has grown complacent and is no longer in touch with its people so it faces not just the threat of the

Thoengling Empire but insurgent activities from dissident groups within the population.

The threat of Thoengling occupation is largely curtailed by the presence of the corsair band, Ksarru Dzogaerr, and the government actively encourages raids against Thoengling worlds in return for protection by the band. The activities of the Ksarru Dzogaerr are well known and the group are gaining more support from the citizens of Knoerrgh. Elements within the government now fear that the corsair band will make a bid for power that has the support of the populace and the government is powerless to prevent this from happening.

Olgan B88A302-9 Olgan is an ocean world with seven small islands. It was settled by a small group of Vargr farmers in 621 who tried breeding various types of livestock to support their small community. Various animals were transported from all over the Extents but only the aggressive ksarrg seemed to thrive here and were isolated on a single island.

The farmers soon learnt the techniques for hunting the creatures. Visits to the ksarrg island eventually became a sport as much as a food gathering exercise. Very few worlds in Gvurrdon sector have been able to breed ksarrg, which created a lucrative export for the people of Olgan.

When the Thoengling Empire was expanding, Olgan was soon taken and ksarrg grounds were created on three more islands. As word spread of the successful ksarrg enclosures, many Vargr visited Olgan to partake in hunting expeditions; a traditional pastime that was still popular for many hunters and warriors. The hunting grounds are strictly regulated and have become a popular destination for many Vargr in the Thoengling Empire and beyond.

Thoengling A9AA6BA-B Thoengling is a large world with vast fl uid oceans covering most of the planet's surface. The toxic nature of the oceans has saturated the land and air, preventing life from developing here. This has led to many individuals to postulate why it became the capital of the Thoengling Empire in 1011 and was renamed accordingly.

There are several reasons for the relocation of the Thoengling capital. Firstly, the planet is located in the center of the Empire, minimising travel times for couriers and supplies and maximising the reach of the government's infl uence. Secondly, since the core offi cials and bureaucrats are all situated on this inhospitable and unpleasant world, only the most loyal and dedicated individuals are compelled to live here. The original capital on Ikkhadzkfaghukh had such a large population that dissident movements would be a risk to the leadership and without a surplus population that threat is minimised.

TTHOENGLINGHOENGLING

The inhabitants of Thoengling live in two underwater pressure domes. One is reserved for the nobility and has all the facilties one would expect with lavish buildings and large open parks to maintain the lifestyle befi tting the upper class. In contrast to this, the lower classes live in a second rate dome, which provides views of the lifeless and murky ocean. These facilities were necessary given the lack of land but its inaccessibility also provides additional defence against potential attacks. The downport is located on a small landmass located a short distance away from both domes.

The majority of the 1,500,000 population all serve the government in some fashion, from administrators to ministers. The rest of the population are essentially servants, tending to the needs of the government offi cials. Workers are well paid but life on Thoengling is dull, with little in the way of recreational facilities.

Ikkhadzkfaghukh A6858CB-7 Ikkhadzkfaghukh is the most heavily populated world in the subsector with over 400 million people occupying the medium- sized planet. The majority of the populace are Vargr from the Gvegh and Aekhu cultures but there are also small communities of Logaksu Vargr and humans.

Ikkhadzkfaghuk was the original seat of power for the Thoengling Empire until 1011 when it was relocated to the newly named

world, Thoengling. Once the main ruling body had left, a new local government was established and is currently run by a charismatic and popular leader.

Citizens on Ikkhadzkfaghukh have few restriction imposed on them and are able to live free and independent lives. There are strict laws governing the use of weapons, which has successfully reduced crime by 20% in the last two years.

Even for a Vargr world, Ikkhadzkfaghukh is extremely diverse in both culture and trade. Many religions are followed on Ikkhadzkfaghukh with individuals changing their beliefs as their situation demands. There is roughly an equal mix of commercial, farming, manufacturing and mining organizations with no single industry dominating produce and trade.

The well known heavy-equipment company, Dzofakael (see page 118), is also based here in its largest factory and warehouse complex. The Dzofakael corporation brings a lot of trade to Ikkhadzkfaghukh and provides many jobs to the inhabitants.

#### KFAN UZANGOU

Kfan Uzangou is one of the most hostile subsectors in Gvurrdon sector. There are 13 independent states that cover most of the subsector, whilst the Thirz Empire, Worlds of Leader Rukh and the Zhodani Consulate each control a corner.

Ethue B554363-B Although Ethue is located adjacent to the Zhodani border, it was never part of the Consulate's plans for colonization and was ignored for thousands of years. Similarly, the Vargr had never paid much heed to the world either until it was settled during the Gvegh Wars by refugees fl eeing the many war-zones.

The population slowly grew to about 5,000 where it remained relatively constant. Situated between a Zhodani and another Vargr world meant that regular transports passed through and the Vargr gradually built up their settlement into the high-tech city that it is today.

Two years ago a pack of prospectors discovered the remains of an Ancient settlement buried deep underground. The potential of new technology and riches was high and the prospectors, led by a wily individual named Konlo hired some experts and began to excavate the site.

Once news of this discovery reached the governor, he knew that such a fi nd could transform his small settlement into a rich and prosperous city. His negotiations with Konlo were unsuccessful so the greedy governor decided to use force to acquire what he perceived to be rightly his. Konlo suspected such a move and hired mercenaries to protect his livelihood.

Several battles ensued and Konlo needed to end the hostilities quickly before the Ancient site was damaged. Konlo paid a corsair band to help take control of Ethue and push the governor out of power. Konlo's plan was successful but his actions were not popular with the people of Ethue, so Konlo continues to hire mercenaries and corsairs to maintain control of the city and the Ancient site.

Khoeghersaeng B896455-7 Khoeghersaeng used to be a Zhodani world called Zdetlroz. Large domes protected the inhabitants from the tainted atmosphere and the cities were of a moderate size.

When the Worlds of Leader Rukh expanded just over 50 years ago, Rukh wanted to take a Zhodani world to 'send a message'. The war for Khoeghersaeng began in 1097 and lasted several months, during which time many of the cities were destroyed. The Vargr were eventually victorious but they had taken huge losses, with Rukh himself receiving a fatal injury. The message had been sent but with the death of Rukh it had little meaning.

Many of the surviving Zhodani left their devastated world but some were unable or unwilling to leave; those that remained formed a new community in one of the smaller domes. The Vargr populated one of the remaining cities but the two races remain very much segregated.

The Zhodani Consulate considered retaking their world but ultimately decided against it. With the death of Rukh the

The Worlds of Leader Rukh are the most contentious nation, sparking hostilities with numerous governments on their border including the Zhodani. With so many independent worlds there is also a lot of piracy carried out by several different corsair bands as well as the Rukh navy.

Amidst the numerous confl icts that terrorise so many worlds in Kfan Uzangou, the Zhodani and the Thirz Empire have fostered mutual trade agreements and relations between these two governments are at their strongest in this subsector.

Aersaedha B98A88A-8 During the expansion of the Thirz Empire, Aersaedha occupied a key strategic location but was already controlled by an independent government unwilling to join the Thirz Empire. Although the government's military was much weaker than the Thirz forces, the Vargr on Aersaedha were united and formed a strong resistance to defend their world. They fought for two years before they were eventually conquered by the Thirz army.

The Thirz Empire quickly constructed a base to strengthen their borders and a new government was put in place. Thirz citizens were encouraged to settle on Aersaedha from Uerra Rueshken subsector to help establish the infrastructure of this important world. Most of the original inhabitants who had survived did not have the means to leave and were used as slave labour in the rebuilding of the Thirz colony.

The descendents of the original inhabitants remain an underclass and are segregated into secured slave communities. To maintain the safety of the Thirz citizens from the slave population, all weapons are banned beyond the spaceport.

Aedhue A9C4000-0 Aedhue is a border world in the Thirz Empire. It was once a thriving world with a population numbering over 500,000 people. As the war on Aersaedha continued, army bases on Aedhue were used as staging points to deploy reinforcements and supplies to the troops on Aersaedha.

A highly skilled and much respected military unit from the Aersaedha resistance spent months of planning to infi ltrate one of the enemy bases here. It was a suicide mission but they completed their objective; to detonate nuclear warheads stored in a supply depot on Aedhue.

The result was devastating. The exact yields of the weapons are unknown but the base and nearby cities were utterly destroyed. The nuclear winter that followed forced the survivors to evacuate the planet and Aedhue remains uninhabitable.

The Thirz Empire has since improved their security protocols and plans are currently underway to rebuild Aedhue and restore it to its former glory.

expansion of his empire had halted, so attacking at that time might provoke the Vargr into another war that the Zhodani could not afford.

Gvurrdon B756986-C Gvurrdon was once the seat of power for the mighty Gvurrdon Pact (circa –2700 to –2300). During the peak of the Gvurrdon Pact, the population on Gvurrdon numbered in the billions. Vast sprawling metropolises spanned the globe with high-rise buildings interconnected by a criss-cross of walkways and transport tubes.

The population continued to grow. Individuals were drawn to the capital for fame and fortune, and to become part of the grand empire. The cities were bursting at the seams and with so little land left for farming, the cities were expanded underground.

As the subterranean levels evolved, so did the society of Gvurrdon. The upper cities were more desirable and therefore more expensive; only the wealthy remained, forcing the poorer people and companies into the under-cities were the cost of living was cheaper. Such a distinction was made between upper and under-city that two classes emerged.

To be wealthy one must be successful and success usually means charisma. So those living in the upper cities had a great deal of respect and infl uence, whilst those underground lack the charisma to make it into the esteemed upper-world. With this new underclass living below the cities, the undesirable jobs made the same transition and had the lowest pay. This culture and class system on Gvurrdon continues to this day.

A common term used on Gvurrdon is 'rising up through society' and making the transition from under-city to upper-city is seen as a great achievement by both classes – Vargr are not judged on where they came from, it is their current standing that is of importance.

After the decline of the Gvurrdon Pact, Gvurrdon went through numerous governments and leaders. With such a large population many factions emerged, each vying for power. The current government has been in power for 30 years with little opposition.

The popularity of Gvurrdon still holds sway and the large population attracts many corporations. The renowned Kaengvarrg corporation (see page 118) formed on Gvurrdon 16

years ago where they established their fi rst institute to fi nd and train psions with untapped potential.

Aerrigha B6888DE-7 Aerrigha is the only world in Gvurrdon sector ruled by the Faarzgaen religion (see page 35 for details). A Faarzgaen priest called Azae had built a strong following in one of the cities on Aerrigha. She had big ambitions, not only to rule Aerrigha but also to become one of the seven Kafaazgaen (overlords) of Faarzgaen.

With the support of her followers, Azae murdered the governor and seized power. The people of Aerrigha now live in a religious dictatorship – they must demonstrate their devotion to the one true god Faarzgaen or face cruel punishments for their disobedience and lack of faith. Those who repeatedly fail to acknowledge Faarzgaen are taken to forced labour camps and live the rest of their days as slaves.

Shortly after becoming ruler of Aerrigha, Azae became an overlord of Faarzgaen by assassinating the individual she replaced. She is a particularly cold and cruel individual who commands obedience and respect from anyone in her presence.

Access to Aerrigha is strictly monitored. Access to the spaceport is only granted to those who have proven their faith in Faarzgaen

- anyone landing on Aerrigha who does not demonstrate their faith will be punished accordingly and could be forced into slavery. Proving one's faith can be as simple as acknowledging the One God but more dogmatic offi cials will require greater knowledge of the religion such as quoting scriptures or reciting history. For this reason, very few people visit Aerrigha unless they are believers or know enough about the religion to bluff their way into the spaceport.

#### RUKH

Rukh sector was named by the well-know leader who began his empire in this subsector. The Worlds of Leader Rukh controls 12 systems in Rukh but since the death of their leader in 1097, three worlds have declared independence. The Society of Equals also has a small presence in Rukh but their worlds are far enough away from the Worlds of Leader Rukh to avoid hostilities (in this subsector at least).

Although the expansion of the Rukh empire has all but stopped, there are four neutral governments that border the empire (three of which were once part of it). Hostilities are on the rise and many fear that Rukh's son, Rraedzou, will eventually reclaim these worlds and spark a new expansion of the empire.

Orra A00089C-E Orra is an asteroid that was originally used as a safe haven for smugglers and corsairs. A rudimentary starport was constructed

and as it saw more use, the huge rock was excavated and the settlement gradually evolved. At this time Orra was a lawless and dangerous place but it still attracted numerous Vargr packs.

When Rukh fi rst arrived on the scene he saw the potential of Orra and the brigands that frequented it. He united several corsair bands and soon gained a following powerful enough to begin his empire. The facility on Orra was enlarged and became a fully functional city from where Rukh could lead his people to glory.

Orra remained the capital of Rukh's empire and as the nation expanded, the need for bureaucracy and administration grew with it. Most of these duties continue to be performed on Orra but the city, which has since been expanded beyond the confi nes of the asteroid, also thrives from manufacturing and trade.

Voullatueng A203326-E Voullatueng is a small frozen wasteland ravaged by constant winds and deadly storms. The planet is unstable causing frequent earthquakes and avalanches. Voullatueng is such a hostile planet that only the brave or desperate come here and few stay long enough to call it home.

The reason for the small settlement here is simple. Resources. Buried beneath the ice are untapped reservoirs of rare mineral deposits. Once these resources were discovered a small colony was formed but the conditions were so harsh that it was diffi cult to sustain – even high-quality pressure domes were vulnerable to the earthquakes.

However, some of the settlers and miners persevered and continued to rebuild the settlement using lots of smaller domes that had a greater structural integrity. Eventually the city began to grow until the population capped at just over 7,000 people.

Even though living conditions were greatly improved, working the mines was still very hard and extremely hazardous. Higher rates of pay helped in this matter but the turnaround of workers still remained a problem. There were, and still are, periods when the mines are inactive due to staff shortages.

Life inside the domes is much the same as most worlds in this region of the Extents, except for Quake Alerts. Scientists and technicians are responsible for monitoring the tectonic movements and issue a Quake Alert whenever an earthquake is imminent. During a Quake Alert, the domes are locked down and the population ride out the tremors inside dedicated safety bunkers. There is usually some damage to the city but it is minimal and there has not been any major structural damage or casualties for seven years.

Voullatueng was taken by the Worlds of Leader Rukh in 1064. It was considered a strategic takeover, not just for the resources

it could provide but to also establish the Rukh borders in the subsector. The people of Voullatueng did not put up much of a fi ght – they had few ships and fi ghting surface battles was even more hazardous than mining.

Voullatueng was actually one of several worlds to benefi t from being conquered by Rukh. The facilities were improved and the starport was upgraded. Life has improved under the rule of the Worlds of Leader Rukh but the miners are taxed heavily and the Rukh empire gets priority on all ore that is mined here.

Kfolaell B86AAA6-B Kfolaell is a water world that started as the site of an experimental fl oating city. The concept was for a self-sustaining settlement that could draw energy and minerals from its environment (in this case, the water and sunlight). The technology had the option of a sealed dome but the atmosphere on Kfolaell was breathable so this was unnecessary.

The city was a success and the kudos gained from the experiment attracted more Vargr to Kfolaell. Newer and larger cities were built on the oceans and more people came for their share of the riches to be had on this new world.

Kfolaell became a popular world for interstellar trade, especially for the high-tech goods manufactured in most cities. When the Society of Equals was expanding its infl uence, the Kfolaell government was happy to join since most worlds they traded with were already members.

More recently, Kfolaell has become well known for being the home port of the Gvaeknoks corporation. Gvaeknoks is a shipping company that has become so successful that they trade beyond the borders of the Society of Equals without reprisal from the government.

Kaneldhuelloug A6535A9-A Kaneldhuelloug was an average Vargr world in many ways with a common mix of agriculture, commerce and industry. However, many farmers needed specialized equipment and tools to cope with the hard ground and rough terrain that was common to most areas. The result of this was advanced farming equipment being developed and produced by numerous manufacturers. So popular were these items that they became Kaneldhuelloug's largest export.

In 1068 Kaneldhuelloug was captured by the Worlds of Leader Rukh and remained part of the empire until 1097 when Rukh was killed in action. At this time a charismatic and popular leader called Segze was governing Kaneldhuelloug; with the empire weakened and in disarray, Kaneldhuelloug saw it as an opportunity to declare independence from the Worlds of Leader Rukh.

Kaneldhuelloug was the fi rst of three worlds to free themselves of Rukh's rule but it was not as simple as merely speaking the words; two military bases were situated on Kaneldhuelloug and the army were controlled by and loyal to the Worlds of Leader Rukh. Segze had the support of the entire population and what

his men lacked in experience and weapons they made up in numbers. Casualties were high but Rukh's forces were driven from Kaneldhuelloug.

Even before the uprising, Kaneldhuelloug was not a rich world and the cost of liberation was high. Farms and factories no longer had enough workers to operate effi ciently and numerous other businesses were shutdown with so many of the workforce killed in the fi ghting.

Kaneldhuelloug may be a poor world now, but the people have a leader they respect and the citizens are free of Rukh's rule. The world has had to consolidate its population and several cities are now abandoned as the people who once lived there are either dead or have merged with another city. The current state of Kaneldhuelloug has meant that it is currently of no interest or importance to the Worlds of Leader Rukh and is unlikely to be retaken anytime soon.

#### KSITS USATHU

Ksits Usathu mainly comprises of independent worlds; 17 in total. The Society of Equals has seven worlds in this subsector, controlling the spinward coreward quarter. The Worlds of Leader Rukh and Thoengling Empire both control one system in Ksits Usathu, giving them minimal infl uence in the subsector. Ksits Usathu is also one of the few subsectors in Gvurrdon sector to have a human controlled world.

With the majority of worlds in this subsector being independent, hostilities are common and confl ict is a way of life in Ksits Usathu. To add to the instability and danger of the subsector, two rival corsair bands, the Uthfoaek and the Zollanngougz, are at war with each other but continue to prey on the shipping lanes.

The corsair activity only serves to fuel the fi res of confl ict between the independent worlds. One government will usually suspect or accuse a rival of authorising raids against them, causing increased tensions and acts of violence. These accusations are diffi cult to prove or disprove and are just one of the many reasons why emissaries are in such high demand in Ksits Usathu.

Aengvoung A682766-B The fi rst Vargr settlers arrived on Aengvoung during the First Diaspora, where they discovered an indigenous race of humans who call themselves Arzaga. The Arzaga are a low-tech civilization and their origins remain a mystery – some think they were one of the many races seeded by the Ancients but others conclude that they are descendents of an old Vilani colony. The latter theory seems to hold more weight as the Arzaga do display certain Vilani traits.

Whatever the reason, the origins are the Arzaga were of little concern to the Vargr who quickly exploited the humans as slave labour to build their growing Vargr civilization. The Arzaga remain slaves and now account for roughly 60% of the workforce and population.

With such cheap labour available to them the Vargr settlers soon established a variety of industries from farming to manufacturing, often undercutting the prices in neighboring systems by signifi cant margins.

Aengvoung became a rich and prosperous world and much of its exports are now high-technology goods, which they sell to many worlds throughout the subsector. The majority of Vargr on Aengvoung are employed as merchants, corporate management or slavers.

Dzenzaega B20189B-7 Dzenzaega is an ice world that was once a thriving civilization in the Society of Equals. Cities and settlements were carved out of the frozen terrain to support the numerous mining facilities located in similar underground structures.

Dzenzaega was a hive of activity for nearly 100 years, attracting settlers, miners and prospectors from all over the sector and the population reached several hundred million people. Unfortunately the work was so aggressive that the planet was strip-mined, resulting in massive unemployment and a collapsed economy.

A mass exodus followed but the population that remained still numbered over 100 million. A number of civilian uprisings followed and the government was soon pushed out of power. With little support from the Society of Equals and neighboring worlds, the new government declared independence and had to fi nd new ways for their civilization to survive.

The people of Dzenzaega soon learnt new skills and adopted new professions. Shipping lines were established and the old mining facilities were converted to factories and warehouses. Many of the refi neries remained and were used to refi ne fuel and imported ore.

Dzenzaega may not be a rich world but it successfully reinvented itself to cope with the adversity of change. This is a good example of how benefi cial the Vargr way of life can be

- only their diversity and camaraderie made this possible.

More recently, the Uthfoaek corsair band constructed a base on Dzenzaega and the group works in cooperation with the government and its people. The base is hidden somewhere in the frozen landscape of the northern polar region. Their presence provides some protection from rival states in exchange for sanctuary.

##### KKSITS USATHUSITS USATHU

Kfenkudhuegzo B656120-7 Kfenkudhuegzo is owned by the Zollanngougz corsair band who established their main base of operations here. The starport was built primarily to support the base and to provide fuelling and repair facilities. Kfenkudhuegzo has a small settlement that is actually part of the starport. There are roughly 50 permanent residents but with visitors and merchants there are usually 70 to 80 people here at any one time. The inhabitants of Kfenkudhuegzo are stationed here to operate the starport.

There are no laws or rules on Kfenkudhuegzo, but since it is known to be run by the Zollanngougz, few legitimate travellers come here for fear of being attacked and their cargo stolen. Some smugglers who are allied with the Zollanngougz use the starport as a safe haven and for refuelling when required. Many of these smugglers end up joining the corsairs.

Gurzhvoursivazae B642410-A Gurzhvoursivazae was settled by humans during the Vargr Pillaging. Originally from Provence sector, they were captured by the Vargr and taken as slaves. They were being transported to the spinward region of Gvurrdon sector but en route they overpowered their captors and took refuge on Gurzhvoursivazae.

The settlers soon learnt that more humans were being taken as slaves and that many Vargr packs were now settling in this region. Since the humans still had a working Vargr ship, they

took it upon themselves to raid Vargr ships and liberate as many slaves as they could. Their numbers and resources soon grew, as did their settlement.

Over a period of 10 years, the humans liberated thousands of slaves and amassed a sizable fl eet, enough to deter any Vargr from attacking their world. Living in relative safety and with the hope of rescuing more slaves, the humans remained on Gurzhvoursivazae and their settlement grew into a small city.

Not all of the liberated slaves were human, there were Vargr too. Grateful for freedom, many of these Vargr remained with the humans and became part of the society. Of the 15,000 population, roughly 2,000 are Vargr.

Gaelaeth C560AC9-A The desert planet of Gaelaeth remained uninhabited for thousands of years. The hot climate and lack of water has prevented any form of life evolving and its lack of natural resources gives it little value. However, that has not stopped the occasional prospector from scanning the planet for previously undiscovered mineral deposits.

Shortly after the Gvegh Wars ended, a skilled prospector made the discovery of his career. Buried deep beneath the vast deserts were large egg-shaped alien artefacts; there were three in total, spaced equidistant from each other. Why they had not

been discovered before he was not sure, perhaps the winds had blown enough of the sands away so he could detect them or maybe he was just lucky.

Scientists soon came to investigate these unusual devices and three small settlements formed near the site of each artefact. Experts spent decades studying the devices before they deduced that the technology had a psionic interface. Once some psions were found they were able to activate the devices via a psionic interface. However, even when active the scientists were unable to learn the function of the artefacts but they did eventually agree that the devices were of Ancient design.

Interest in the Ancient artefacts waned but the settlements continued to grow at astonishing rates. It was 50 years later when a clever scientist called Ksangho realised that the birth rate on Gaelaeth was unusually high for its population size. Her investigations revealed that litter sizes were twice the average size and occurred more often. Tracing the evidence back, this phenomenon appeared to have begun when the Ancient devices were activated.

Now the function of the devices was known, at least in part, interest in the Ancient technology was renewed. More scientists and experts came to Gaelaeth, often bringing their families with them. Ksangho headed the research team and new research facilities were built. Sensing potential opportunities for gaining charisma and wealth, other Vargr came to the boomtowns of Gaelaeth.

The obvious result of this sudden migration was an exponential increase in population and Gaelaeth soon became overpopulated. Although the devices were deactivated at certain times, in order to study them fully the artefacts had to be active.

During this period, scientists discovered that the increased fertility was just one part of a grander scheme. Evidence suggests that the three devices were an Ancient experiment in terraforming and lifeform production. Data stored in the devices indicated that the terraforming had not only failed, but made the environment less habitable by drying up the few water sources that had once existed.

The lifeform production aspect of the technology was obviously working but the Ancient experiment had ultimately failed. How the technology works is still beyond the capabilities of the scientists but the government prevented further study, decreeing that the Ancient technology should be deactivated until such a time it might be needed. The population growth has now returned to normal and the devices are secured and guarded.

It was the high population on Gaelaeth that attracted the now famous merchant Dhirrsak to start his business here. Dhirrsak's

is the largest corporation on Gaelaeth and has grown so big that Dhirrsak monopolises the second hand market, employing thousands of people including some of the best junk dealers in the region.

Most other corporations on Gaelaeth tend be shipping lines and manufacturers. Processed food and hydroponics are also big business, as are water reclamation plants and related industries.

#### AELLUEKH

The coreward half of Aelluekh is dominated by the Thoengling Empire with 11 systems under their control. The remaining 17 worlds are all independent states. A number of small corsair bands operate in the subsector but most raids are conducted by a powerful group known as the Llangzoekirs who control four bases.

The dangers and confl icts in Aelluekh are much the same as those in the neighboring subsector of Ksits Usathu – high corsair activity ignites tensions between states but since most operate under the banner of Llangzoekirs, attacks are more coordinated and diffi cult to prevent. Most corsair raids are directed against the independent worlds rather than face the military might of the Thoengling Empire.

Confl ict also exists between the Thoengling Empire and the nearby neutral states. The Thoengling borders are prone to frequent change as worlds are conquered or declare their independence from the Empire. These border worlds tend to embargo trade with the Thoengling Empire but worlds situated further away have trade agreements and permits that allow safe travel within the Empire's borders.

Several worlds in this subsector have a signifi cant human presence. Some have integrated into the Vargr cities and others live more segregated lives in separate communities.

Aelluekh is also well known for the number of agricultural worlds in the subsector. Many of the planets were found to have numerous indigenous animals that have become popular with the Vargr. Several of these worlds have instituted breeding programs and attempted to transport the livestock to other worlds but unfortunately few of the animals survived outside of their natural environment.

Arrag B575777-9 Arrag is one of several agrarian worlds in Aelluekh subsector and was taken by the Thoengling Empire for this very reason. The original settlers were all from the Aekhu culture and had formed small family oriented communities. They numbered around 500,000 and put up little resistance to the Thoengling Empire.

Arrag now has a population of 60,000,000 with approximately half living in the major cities on each of the six continents. The remaining inhabitants live in small farming communities much like the original Aekhu farmsteads.

When the Thoengling Empire fi rst took control of Arrag, breeding programs were instigated for mass food production essential to the expanding Empire. Many of the early attempts to transport livestock to other worlds failed, but selective breeding and genetic engineering fi nally produced new breeds that could endure other environments. Arrag is now one of the main food producers for the Thoengling Empire and exports over half their produce, which mainly consists of meat and livestock.

The mass farming and food production has caused numerous problems on Arrag. The demands made by the Empire have resulted in some areas being over-farmed resulting in poor quality food. The local farmers often struggle to survive and many have gone out of business.

Over the last decade these disgruntled farmers have formed their own political faction in an attempt to seize power. This group is gaining much support from the populace. The descendents of the original Aekhu settlers have also established a third faction and have immediately gained the support of other Aekhu Vargr. These two factions are both competing against the Thoengling appointed governors and the dark cloud of civil war looms ever closer.

Aetskaekhoun B988954-8 Aetskaekhoun is a large ocean world on the border of the Thoengling Empire. It is typical of most Vargr worlds with a diverse mix of industries and culture. The central location of Aetskaekhoun in Aelluekh has also made it an important trade hub as it is the only world that directly connects the coreward and rimward halves of the subsector for Jump-2 capable ships.

The importance of its location has given it a turbulent history and it has gone through numerous governments of all types, each taking control and trying to do what's best for the people. Aetskaekhoun has been conquered several times during its history, most notably during the Gvegh Wars but new factions always emerge to seize power and declare independence.

This pattern continued until the Thoengling Empire took power in 1087 and retained control. Ironically, once part of the Empire the importance of Aetskaekhoun has lessened since the strict trade laws deter many potential merchants from trading here.

Aetskaekhoun is also famous for the foundation of the Zhosokh Urs and their prestigious academy for emissaries. Unfortunately, this renowned school began to decline once it was part of the Thoengling Empire as fewer Vargr travelled here to train. Financial

problems eventually forced the academy to close down but the Zhosokh Urs emissaries that remain are still in high demand.

Gaegzue B574540-B Gaegzue is a fairly small world that was found to have a number of indigenous creatures that were palatable to the Vargr. Settlements were soon established to farm the animals and the population grew to around 700,000 people. Apart from the capital city of Arrrarrghvadz, which has a population of 400,000, most of the settlements are small towns and farmsteads spread across the planet.

The Gaegzue starport is situated north of Arrrarrghvadz and is a hive of activity. Approximately 25% of the meat farmed on Gaegzue is exported to other worlds in the Thoengling Empire.

Gaegzue has a slight taint in the atmosphere that does not affect the indigenous wildlife but is hazardous to most other lifeforms within 1d6 hours if a suitable fi lter or respiratory device is not worn. Buildings are sealed with fi ltration devices but no other specialized equipment is needed for survival.

The Vargr on Gaegzue are all from the Gvegh culture and have a rather curious approach to choosing their leaders. Every year, or sooner if the people are unhappy with the current administration, infi ghting tournaments are held to determine the new planetary leader and other high-ranking offi cials within the government.

The tournaments are held outside in a special arena situated on the outskirts of Arrrarrghvadz. Only Vargr infi ghting is permitted during the competition and contestants are only permitted to wear fi lters during the intervals that occur every few hours – this is to help prove the contestant's strength and endurance, and usually results in several casualties. The tournament begins with large free-for-all fi ghts where the winner is the last man standing. Following this, duels are fought using a heat system until an overall winner is determined.

Although this system of selection might appear un-Vargr like, it is still rooted in charisma but rather than being based on standing gained from past deeds, it is about the charisma gained during the tournament and proves the strength and conviction of the contenders. Many untrained Vargr participate but it does not matter if they lose, the fact they competed against skilled fi ghters will often earn them respect and charisma.

The tournaments have evolved over the years and separate competitions held within the main event are sponsored by numerous organizations from corporations to the Thoengling military. The military gain many new recruits from the Gaegzue Tournaments. Many of these additional contests are pack fi ghts, where two packs face each other and the winning pack will be granted a position or patronage by the sponsor.

##### AALLUEKHLLUEKH

Ngulivuedakhsnaru E748778-5 In many ways, Ngulivuedakhsnaru is similar to Arrag – both have an abundance of wildlife and livestock, both have a tainted atmosphere, both were settled by farming communities and both were seized by the Thoengling Empire primarily for food production.

However, unlike Arrag, the population openly rebelled against their Thoengling masters. The short war for independence was won largely due to the presence and help from the Llangzoekirs corsairs. Ngulivuedakhsnaru was the second largest food producer for the Thoengling Empire in this subsector and was a signifi cant loss to them; the Empire will most likely attempt to reclaim this world at some point in the future.

Whilst under Thoengling control, breeding programs were initiated much like those on Arrag to allow the indigenous livestock to survive in other environments. This program was not successful and was one of the reasons for the civilian uprising. The farmers on Ngulivuedakhsnaru have since reverted to more traditional methods of farming.

Even though Ngulivuedakhsnaru is currently free of the Empire, the situation has deteriorated. Without the strict Thoengling control, numerous factions have emerged and the typical Vargr struggle for power threatens to destabilize the planet, allowing the Thoengling Empire to potentially reclaim it in its weakened state.

#### LLANIC

Llanic subsector is dominated by the Zhodani Consulate that controls 15 systems. The remaining 14 worlds are all independent states. However, another power does exist in Llanic that has gone largely unnoticed – the Llanic Raiders are a secret coalition of corsair bands that control all corsair activity in the subsector but none of the governments have realised that such a high level of organization exists amongst the pirates.

Although the usual confl icts occur between Vargr states, few confl icts are directed against the Zhodani Consulate except from the Llanic Raiders. This is largely due to the power and infl uence of the Zhodani in this sector – none of the small Vargr states have the military might to take on such a large empire.

Relations between the Vargr and Zhodani in Llanic subsector have not always been this way though. During the Gvegh Wars, a number of attacks were made against Zhodani worlds but only Izivr was captured by the Vargr and subsequently recaptured by the Zhodani.

Jdiprqrafr B100A99-C Jdiprqrafr was fi rst settled by the Zhodani to establish their presence in Gvurrdon sector around the year –4000. A small base was constructed along with several pressure domes on the surface of this small planet. As the Zhodani settled more worlds in Llanic and neighboring subsectors, Jdiprqrafr became the regional capital for the Consulate.

More domed cities were built until there was no more room to construct new settlements. It was during this period that new fl oating cities using gravitic technology started to fi ll the skies. Jdiprqrafr is now a metropolis of countless city-states dominating the landscape.

Jdiprqrafr might be overpopulated but the Zhodani emphasis on happiness is evident in the architecture and recreational areas

- parks, natural areas, fountains and sculptures can be found in every settlement and some domes have been created solely for this purpose with vast gardens to offer sanctuary from the fast paced city life.

Jdiprqrafr is an industrial world that has primary exports in weapons and computer components. Other high-tech equipment and software engineering are also lucrative markets here.

Tlrt B698542-B Tlrt was originally a low priority for colonization by the Zhodani Consulate. A small settlement was established around –4200 to discover its potential for agricultural purposes to provide food for Zhodani worlds in Llanic. It was during this initial investigation that some alien ruins were found built into one of the mountain ranges. Experts were immediately brought in to confi rm that they were of Ancient design.

Tlrt became a priority world. Research facilities were built and scientists were brought to Tlrt to begin studying the ruins. Survey teams were also deployed to see if other Ancient sites or technology could be found and two years of careful exploration revealed two additional sites – one was discovered buried under the vast plains of the continent dominating the northern hemisphere and the other was little more than rubble situated on the same continent, presumably destroyed during the Ancients War.

Only the fi rst site was relatively intact but so far no technology has been found. Experts believe that Tlrt was evacuated during an attack, which accounts for the state of other two settlements and lack of usable items or technology.

Whilst the scientifi c community was growing and examining the Ancient sites, farming settlements were also being established to support the rising population. Tlrt is now one of three major agricultural worlds for the Zhodani in Llanic subsector.

Izivr D426974-9 Izivr is located just inside Zhodani territory and borders with two Vargr worlds. This small world has seen a lot of confl ict during its history. A small Zhodani settlement had been established on Izivr long before the Vargr began to settle in Gvurrdon sector but unfortunately, the settlement was not very advanced when the Vargr arrived during the Diaspora. The Zhodani were unaware that they were sharing their world with another race for nearly a decade.

Once contact had been made, both races lived far enough apart to avoid confl ict and the Zhodani tolerated their new neighbors. Over time, both societies expanded and their borders grew closer together. Whilst the Zhodani respected the borders, the Vargr did not and much to the Zhodani's distress the two cultures started to mix.

The difference between the cultures and lack of understanding was too great and tensions increased. Some of the Vargr liked their Zhodani neighbors but others did not, especially the Zhodani insistence on rules and regulations. In addition to the growing hostilities between the two races, segregation was also occurring amongst the Vargr.

These hostilities continued for many years, with each faction claiming ownership of the planet and individual territories. Isolated fi ghts started and border skirmishes were made against neighboring territories. Emissaries were often employed to keep the peace and through careful negotiations, all out war was prevented for many centuries.

As these political factions struggled for power, a war was also being fought on the corporate battlefi eld. Competition between the Vargr and Zhodani manufacturers was high. The Zhodani were able to produce technology beyond the understanding of the Vargr engineers but the Vargr workforce was more productive. Price versus quality became a deciding factor in several industries but the Vargr certainly monopolised the second hand market.

The corporate wars and political battles ultimately merged together with corporate interests now being represented in the political arena. The emissaries' work became even more important but not even their skills could maintain peace forever and around –3200 the Izivr War fi nally broke out between the Zhodani and three Vargr factions.

The war continued for several years until the Zhodani Consulate fi nally intervened and deployed a large army to end the confl ict

once and for all. The Vargr factions were overpowered and the Zhodani took control of Izivr. For all their troubles, the Vargr accounted for roughly half of the population and had become important to the local economy – it was for these reasons and the timely intervention of some emissaries the Vargr were permitted to remain under Zhodani rule.

Uenag D543534-6 Uenag is a small world run by corrupt offi cials and criminals. It is a haven for pirates and smugglers where trade thrives on stolen loot and black market goods. Cities on Uenag are extreme versions of cities found on most other Vargr worlds - the colours are brighter, the shouting is louder and the fi ghting is more deadly.

The government (if it can be called that) made deals with corsair bands and smugglers, which served to encourage more of their

kind to visit the world. Uenag became a pirate friendly port that was profi table to both the inhabitants and the criminals that frequented the planet.

Zakskhsakrsa, the leader of Uenag was eventually able to exert his infl uence over the corsairs and formed the Llanic Raiders, a secret coalition of corsair bands. Zakskhsakrsa also became leader of the largest band, the Visorz, and now controls all corsair activity in Llanic subsector. The corsair base is essentially the government's naval base and there are always corsair fl eets deployed to protect Uenag from its many rivals and enemies.

To prevent all-out violence from erupting and unauthorized smuggling, weapons are restricted to personal arms only and landing is only permitted at the starport. However, enforcement of these laws is rather lax as police and starport security can be easily bribed or distracted.

#### SPURL

Spurl experiences more confl ict and hostilities than any other subsector in Gvurrdon, which by Vargr standards is considerable. Spurl is home to the Anti-Rukh Coalition who control six worlds and are the largest nation to openly oppose the Worlds of Leader Rukh. Hostilities between the two empires are never- ending and have made Spurl little more than a war-zone.

Corsair activity is dominated by the Gvankfarraegh corsair band that is largely under the employ of the Anti-Rukh Coalition to raid worlds in the Rukh empire, causing further damage and disruption. Part of this arrangement is that worlds within the borders of the Anti-Rukh Coalition are not to be raided by the Gvankfarraegh.

There are 12 independent worlds in Spurl that frequently war against each other but tend not to get involved with the larger war between the Anti-Rukh Coalition and Worlds of Leader Rukh. Several of these worlds also have signifi cant human settlements, but since hostilities have increased the humans have become more isolated from the warring Vargr.

Aerritho B30086B-B On the surface, Aerritho looks like a barren and lifeless rock. The lack of atmosphere prevents the natural evolution of life, as does the absence of water. However, beneath the surface are numerous minerals and metals that may not be the most rare or valuable but they exist in great quantity.

Aerritho is now a subterranean network of tunnels, shafts and caverns carved out by the mining colony that now inhabits this dreary rock. The settlements and cities have also been excavated beneath the planet's surface and are constantly shifting with changes in the population and leadership. As deposits run dry the population spread into the abandoned shafts, adapting them as required. Older areas are often left to ruin as the cities follow the workforce.

With such a constant change in the city structures it is hardly surprising that many people get lost or turned around, even the inhabitants. Punctuality is therefore a redundant concept on Aerritho; 'I was lost' is a common greeting on this world.

Aerritho has been part of the Anti-Rukh Coalition since its formation in 1069. However, the chaotic nature of this society made it easy for agents of the Worlds of Leader Rukh to infi ltrate and rise through the ranks. In 1103, enough charismatic agents were in place to spark an uprising against the local government and the Anti-Rukh Coalition. The purpose of this was to destabilize the world and gain control of the ore production, which was of great importance to the Anti-Rukh Coalition.

Fortunately for the Anti-Rukh Coalition the local government were able to quell the unrest but loyalties were now in question and the number of Rukh agents that had placed themselves within the populace was unknown. The government now has strict control of the population and imposes the highest laws against weapons and travellers.

Dheg E310335-7 Dheg is a desert world with a population of 7,000. It was fi rst settled by a small group of smugglers who needed a safe haven to store their contraband. As the organization grew, more people came to live here and a rudimentary starport was constructed. As the Worlds of Leader Rukh was gaining infl uence in Spurl, other criminals and corsair groups came to Dheg to refuel and use as a base of operations.

The Gvankfarraegh corsairs gained infl uence and power and eventually seized control of Dheg to use it as their base of operations for staging raids against the Worlds of Leader Rukh. The world is so insignifi cant that the Worlds of Leader Rukh do not see it as a threat but have yet to discover that it is the source of most corsair activity within their borders.

Okfozarrga A596322-9 Okfozarrga is a water world with a breathable atmosphere. It has little in the way of natural resources or indigenous wildlife but was colonized during the Gvegh Wars by refugees fl eeing the war-torn areas of nearby planets.

The people on Okfozarrga have always valued their freedoms and were instrumental in forming the Anti-Rukh Coalition when the Worlds of Leader Rukh threatened to conquer the entire subsector. The charismatic leader Vugvantsu played such an important role in the formation of the new alliance that Okfozarrga became the capital of the new nation.

Dharrgkhaksuzarorrdzuer B843200-7 Dharrgkhaksuzarorrdzuer lies on the border of the Worlds of Leader Rukh. It was once a thriving civilization of over

100,000 people who inhabited a single domed city. After it was captured by Rukh in 1090, riots and infi ghting overwhelmed the city.

Initially the hostilities were directed at the Rukh military stationed in the city but numerous packs formed and violence was soon erupting on every street corner. Vehicles were smashed and buildings destroyed as the city was reduced to a gangland of ghettos and slums.

Most of the population evacuated to safer worlds to be followed by the law enforcement and military divisions who were unable

to control the aggressive packs that now ruled the streets. Although Dharrgkhaksuzarorrdzuer is technically still part of the Worlds of Leader Rukh, the government no longer exists and the Dharrgkhaksuzarorrdzuer is now a lawless city of anarchy.

Dharrgkhaksuzarorrdzuer has become the epitome of how many humans regard the Vargr. However, the extreme of the behaviour on this world is really an exception and certainly not a typical display of Vargr society.

Dhaengae B9789AA-A Dhaengae is one of the few industrial worlds in Gvurrdon sector. The large planet only has two continents, which have been joined by a gigantic bridge. As technology improved, transport tubes were also constructed to increase transport between the landmasses.

Most of the land has been built upon, crammed with sprawling cities and large factories. Very little space is left for farming and most food is grown in hydroponic facilities or processed artifi cially.

The population of seven billion people now live and work in sealed buildings or wear fi lters to protect them from the tainted atmosphere – although Dhaengae is a TL10 world, many of the factories use more primitive technology and centuries of use has polluted the air.

Dhaengae has a high percentage of humans for this region of space, which account for nearly 10% of the population. Most of them coexist with the Vargr but some cities see more segregation where the humans have their own community or live in human dominated satellite towns. Most of the human inhabitants work for Vargr organizations but some have become charismatic or lucky enough to run their own corporations.

Most manufacturing companies specialize in high-tech goods and equipment, even those with low-tech facilities. The primary exports are electrical equipment, vehicle and ship components. The largest and most successful corporation though is not a manufacturing company, but the well-known shipping line Rraegnaell Oukh (see page 119) that transports goods between Vargr, Imperial and Zhodani worlds.

#### UTHE

Uthe subsector is rife with piracy. Numerous corsair bands raid the shipping lanes and fi ght between themselves for supremacy. Currently there is no dominant power amongst the corsairs but there are seven corsair bases each controlled by a different group. The corsair bands based in the rimward areas of Uthe also raid Imperial worlds in the Regina subsector of the Spinward Marches.

In addition to the many small corsair bands operating throughout Uthe subsector, the Uthfoaek and Zollanngougz corsair bands from Ksits Usathu subsector have also been known to raid the coreward worlds here.

Most of the systems in Uthe are independent states except for the six worlds that make up the 40th Squadron. The 40th Squadron have one of the fi nest naval fl eets in the entire sector and few pirates venture into their territory. There is little confl ict between the many nations of Uthe, with most states directing their navies to suppress the relentless corsair raids.

Attitudes on Uthith, the capital of the 40th Squadron, have changed in recent years and the government there has become balkanised. These sentiments have been echoed on other worlds within the 40th Squadron.

Some of the worlds on the spinward edge of Uthe also contend with the occasional border skirmish from the Worlds of Leader Rukh who attack from Spurl subsector but the Rukh forces are primarily tied up with hostilities against the Anti-Rukh Coalition.

Uthe is also one of the few subsectors in Gvurrdon that has a human controlled world. Triad is a client state of the Imperium with its own naval base, which deters most raiders and potential rival governments. Smaller human settlements also exist on other worlds in the subsector.

Uthith A310877-E Uthith is a desert world with a population of 700,000. There are fi ve large domed cities, each home to roughly 100,000 Vargr. The remaining population live in the capital, which consists of 10 smaller domes located around the starport and connected via transport tubes and underground roadways.

When the 40th Squadron formed in 604, Uthith became the nation's capital. However, Uthith is capityal by name only since the most powerful individuals are naval offi cers ruling from the fl eet. In recent years many of the citizens have grown disaffected with their rulers being so disatant and disconnected from its people. The domed cities on Uthith have created a natural segregation and many of the city governors have separated from the main government in a bid for power.

Pandrin B560675-A Pandrin is a desert world that was originally colonized by human refugees from the Spinward Marches during the First Frontier War. The human settlement expanded and continued to grow for nearly 20 years before it was captured by the Vargr in the Second Frontier War.

Human-Vargr relations have gradually improved on Pandrin but the two races remain largely segregated in the two separate domed cities that are located equidistance from the starport.

Some Vargr do live and work in the human city and a small number of humans do likewise in the Vargr dome. There is a slight undercurrent of tension between the two races and fi ghts are not uncommon, but these mainly occur in bars and busy market areas.

Even though relations are not great, both communities' trade with each other and some human-Vargr friendships have been known to form. However, the humans here are defi nitely the underclass with many of the best jobs taken by the Vargr. The only successful human corporation is Walker Robotics (see page 120), which has gained a good reputation and has a number of Vargr on the payroll.

Knall A000000-0 Knall is an asteroid that was once home to a thriving mining community but now it is an abandoned outpost of collapsed tunnels and deserted buildings. There is no life support or power giving it the feel of a ghost town. Preserved corpses and decayed bodies remain scattered throughout and much of the equipment has been looted.

The truth of what happened here remains a mystery but there are numerous rumors. Some say it is haunted, or home to a strange alien entity or savage beast that roams the dark tunnels. Others believe that some Ancient technology was discovered that led to the destruction of the tunnels and the death of everyone inside. Other theories include sabotage, raiders or simply that the asteroid was over-mined causing the fragile tunnel network to collapse.

Whatever the reason, Knall is a dangerous place. Many have come here to loot the deserted facility for leftover ore and second hand equipment but few have returned. Pirates and smugglers have also been known to come here on occasion but they do not stay long.

Triad B587777-8 Triad was settled by Imperial citizens shortly after the Second Frontier War and gets its name from its three continents separated by vast oceans. The Imperium established this small colony and base to serve as an observation outpost to give advanced warning of potential attacks from the Vargr.

The land proved to be fertile with plenty of indigenous wildlife and Triad became a fl ourishing agrarian world. As tensions settled between the Vargr and the Imperium, neighboring systems began to trade with Triad for livestock and crops. This food produce is now a major export for Triad, making it a very wealthy world in the process. Trade routes have been established with most systems located within three parsecs of Triad.

Several Vargr settlements have been established on Triad and the lack of charismatic human leaders has resulted in many

disaffected Vargr. Most of the Vargr population are seeking stronger leadership from their own kind and two factions have emerged, ultimately seeking to gain power. How the human government will deal with this situation remains to be seen.

#### FIRGR

Firgr subsector consists of 15 independent systems that surround the nine worlds of the Commonality of Kedzudh. The Commonality has done much to suppress piracy in Firgr and most corsair activity originates from neighboring subsectors, most notably by the Llangzoekirs who are based in Aelluekh subsector. The notorious Kforuzeng group are the only corsairs known to be based in Firgr but most of their raiding is directed at worlds along the Deneb border and is of little concern to the Commonality of Kedzudh.

Many of the worlds in Firgr have a signifi cant human population and the interaction between the humans and Vargr varies from world to world but most coexist without too much confl ict. The presence of an Imperial client state has also helped to improve human-Vargr relations.

Ksunekso B525575-A To the casual observer, Ksunekso appears much like any other high-tech Vargr world. On closer inspection however, the culture here is quite different. For nearly a hundred years, the people of Ksunekso have been experts in the development and manufacture of a wide range of drugs.

There were (and still are) numerous drug corporations and research institutes all seeking test subjects to try out new

products. Many such individuals were hired and paid well for their services but ultimately became addicted to the variety of pharmaceuticals they were consuming. Over a period of 15 years roughly 80% of the population became addicted to at least one type of drug and it is now a way of life on Ksunekso.

Some individuals take drugs purely for recreational purposes whilst others use drugs to enhance their abilities and work performance. Communal drug taking has also become a popular pastime with numerous packs convening to consume and share their drug related experiences. Refusing an offer of drugs is a great insult to most citizens and those who do not partake are often viewed with suspicion and mistrust.

The people of Ksunekso are very proud of their accomplishments and will defend their way of life to the many religious groups who view drugs much like augments - blasphemous modifi cations to the perfectly designed Vargr physiology and intellect. The people of Ksunekso became so defensive in their justifi cations that the government has banned all religious groups from setting foot on the planet.

The 20% of citizens that abstain from drug use are also viewed with similar ill feelings. This minority group have gradually been segregated from Ksunekso culture and have been forced to form a new political faction to protect their interests.

Even though Ksunekso is often referred to as the 'planet of junkies', their production of fi rst-rate drugs is still second to none and are exported throughout Gvurrdon sector. However, what the long-term effects of this culture will be remains to be seen.

Ughz A424551-E Ughz is a medium-sized world located near the center of Firgr subsector. It remained uninhabited until 897 when the Rrakhthall family came here to start a new business enterprise. Although the Rrakhthall family was led by the father, it was the three brothers who had the skills, expertise and contacts necessary to establish a ship building company.

The Rrakhthall Shipyards (see page 119) soon became a thriving business, attracting more settlers to Ughz. New factories were built by Rrakhthall Shipyards and smaller companies – these facilities specialized in manufacturing certain types of ship components and ultimately led to the formation of the feudal technocracy government that exists today. The main shipyard was also expanded to serve as a naval base.

When the Commonality of Kedzudh was formed in 1044, the Rrakhthall Shipyards provided many of the ships that were used to combat the corsair raiders. The involvement of Rrakhthall Shipyards was so instrumental that Ughz became the capital for the Commonality of Kedzudh.

Rrakhthall Shipyards and other corporations on Ughz have continued to develop their technologies and have recently started to produce Jump-6 capable ships with more advanced weaponry and sensors.

Torrrrerz A563951-C Torrrrerz is well known throughout the subsector for several reasons. Firstly, the high-tech cities that house the three billion inhabitants are signifi cantly more orderly and structured than most Vargr settlements, having been pre-planned with numer- ous restrictions on what type of structures could be built and where. The cities are very much open plan, with wide spaces and large organised streets. Most cities are divided into spe- cialised districts for commercial, industrial, domestic and rec- reational uses.

An automated public transport system of grav-trains and aircraft provides an easy means to travel between districts and other cities. Private transport is discouraged and largely unnecessary; it is restricted to grav-vehicles only as there are no roads or airports available to the public.

The second well-known fact about Torrrrerz is that many corporations specialize in manufacturing repair, mining and probe drones for starships. In fact, ship drones are the primary export on Torrrrerz, with many being sold to Rrakhthall Shipyards on Ughz. Other companies manufacture electronics and vehicle components.

Torrrrerz is also famous for the Vun Nez Onorka academies of law and politics (see page 120). Emissaries and lawyers trained in these institutes are much sought after and well respected. Ironically, Torrrrerz has very few laws and rarely requires the services of the Vun Nez Onorka graduates.

Gvutson A85A7CE-9 Gvutson is one of two Imperial client states in the Vargr Extents and was established primarily to support the scout base that was built here. The population of 30 million all live in a single city situated on the single landmass of this ocean planet. The government is run by a council of fi ve governors who have equal power and authority.

Since Gvutson was settled in 660, the governors have always been carefully chosen and well liked by the citizens. Some of the leaders have been so popular that they have attracted a number of Vargr communities. The Vargr and humans on Gvutson have integrated well and as long as charismatic governors continue to be elected, confl ict between the humans and Vargr citizens seems unlikely – some infi ghting does occur between the Vargr but not on a scale that causes tensions with the majority human population.

#### ADVENTURING IN GVURRDON

#### SECTOR

PLAYERS! THIS SECTION IS FOR THE REFEREE ONLY The default setting for Traveller games is the Spinward Marches, which serve as a good starting point for most adventures. The Marches are on the borders of the Imperium; there is enough law and civilization to keep the players in line but not too much that they are limited in their actions or feel restricted in what they can do.

Like any good story, roleplaying games need confl ict and Gvurrdon sector provides this in great quantity. With only two Imperial client states and less than 30 Zhodani worlds, Gvurrdon sector provides a perfect backdrop for Referees who want to add more chaos, lawlessness and danger to their campaigns.

Many of the Vargr worlds might have their own laws, but these are limited and rarely enforced with any conviction. Rules and regulations mean little to the Vargr and this is refl ected in most of their legal systems. Laws also change from world to world and are usually managed on a local level. Even the starports are legislated by the local government and are subject to temporary lock downs and change as new factions seize power from decadent governments and uncharismatic leaders.

Many of the scenarios described in this section are typical of Vargr society and can be applied to other Vargr worlds, governments and regions with minimal modifi cation.

Arrag Civil War The government on Arrag (see page 155 for details) was appointed by the Thoengling Empire and the original settlers have fi nally risen up against their oppressors. Arrag is now in a state of civil war. Many of the farmsteads have been destroyed and the crops burned. The workforce has taken up arms to fi ght for their freedom and the people are divided. The fi ghting has spread to the streets and the spaceport has been locked down. Martial law has been declared but the government only has the resources to enforce this in the major cities.

Loyalties are uncertain and people do not always know who to trust. Allegiances change as atrocities are committed by each side and many Vargr are sitting on the fence, looking for the right leader to follow. The dissidents are outnumbered but they are organised with skilled commanders to lead them.

The players might be citizens of Arrag forced to choose sides or they might simply be in the wrong place at the wrong time

- with the starport locked down the players get embroiled in the hostilities and must fi ght to survive. Alternatively, the players are offworld and have been hired to somehow gain access to Arrag and help the rebels.

As the players get involved – gaining both charisma and trust – their role will become more important as they carry out missions that are both dangerous and essential; guerrilla attacks, reconnaissance, rescues and the liberation of equipment and supplies. Once they are in a position of authority, the players must help plan the fi nal victory before food stores run dry and the Thoengling Empire send in reinforcements. The players' actions could shape the future of the entire planet.

Fall of Equals Worlds within the Society of Equals enjoy good trade relations with other member worlds but the restrictions on trading with the other worlds has put a strain on some local economies

- in many cases member worlds can raise their prices as they effectively have a monopoly on the market, especially for the more exotic items.

Purchasing cheaper or higher quality goods from non-member worlds could save both time and money for many corporations and ultimately some of the border worlds will declare independence to boost their economies. As these worlds leave

the Society of Equals, it is entirely possible that it could start a cascade reaction that ripples through the empire – as one world becomes an independent state, member worlds relying on their produce would also be forced to leave the Society of Equals.

The very strength that bound the empire together becomes its undoing. This chain reaction could have numerous consequences:

- In an attempt to prevent further worlds from leaving the
    empire, the Society of Equals might enforce new laws to
    gain a stricter control of its member worlds. The leaders
    might even go as far as declaring martial law or replacing
    governors with those loyal to the Society's agenda.
- The Society of Equals could relax their trade regulations
    and allow free trade to non-member worlds. However, it
    was these trade rules that helped forge the Society and
    without such a system in place there is less of a reason to
    become a member world
- The Society of Equals could lose so many worlds that the
    nation eventually falls apart, having no power beyond its
    homeworld of Oesar Gin.
- As local governments debate whether to remain members
    or leave the Society of Equals, opinions will differ and new
    political factions might emerge. An internal confl ict such as
    this will most likely end in civil war.
- With the empire in decline or fi nished, a power vacuum will
    form in Dzen and Iz Therrg subsectors. New confl icts will
    occur, corsair raids will increase and new powers might
    emerge.

Rise of the Pirate Prince As the Llanic Raiders (see page 116) become more powerful and gain infl uence in Llanic subsector, there will come a time when their activities will no longer be able to be kept secret or their leader Zakskhsakrsa might choose to reveal his power base.

Once the size of this operation is revealed it will drastically alter the balance of power and political climate of Llanic and surrounding subsectors. The Vargr worlds will both fear and respect Zakskhsakrsa and his charisma will certainly infl uence many to his banner. The Zhodani, who currently dominate Llanic subsector, will feel particularly threatened by such a large power suddenly emerging next to their borders. Governments in neighboring subsectors will also see this new nation as a potential problem.

How this situation unfolds is entirely up to the Referee but some suggestions are given below:

- The situation remains much as it is now but the Llanic
    Raiders and other authorized raiding activity is carried out
    more openly.
- Rival corsair bands will be absorbed into the Llanic
    Raiders, forced out of business, oppose the Llanic Raiders
    or continue to operate in Llanic subsector hoping to remain
    unnoticed.
- The Llanic Raiders only target Vargr worlds and perhaps
    capture a few worlds near to their seat of power on Uenag.
- The Llanic Raiders only target Zhodani worlds, claiming
    the Vargr worlds in Llanic subsector for their own. Such
    actions would provoke the Zhodani and could potentially
    lead to war.
- Llanic subsector descends into a state of anarchy. Corsair
    raids become commonplace and any vessel is fair game to
    pirates.
- Empires in neighboring subsectors will almost certainly
    see Zakskhsakrsa and his nation as a threat, creating
    further hostilities and potentially leading to war.
- With such a huge increase in corsair activity, civilians
    (especially merchants) will fl ee to other subsectors where
    it is safer. This could result in the destabilization of local
    governments and economies.
- With any of the above scenarios there is a good chance that
    Llanic subsector becomes a warzone, with various factions
    fi ghting the Llanic Raiders and independent corsair bands.

Emissaries of Gaerr The Pact of Gaerr is currently experiencing a number of problems from within and outside its borders. The capital world of Roedz has endured a balkanised government for several years and rival factions continue to gain support amongst the people. To make matters worse, two worlds in Adhsakh subsector – Karrksinarka and Tanga – have recently seceded from the Pact under hostile conditions (see pages 130 and 128 respectively).

The mutual benefi ts enjoyed by members of the Pact seem to be coming to an end as this nation is beginning to fracture. Those who still believe in the Pact fear that its demise could herald a new period of hostilities and wars between independent governments, and larger nations. To help regain control of the situation, numerous emissaries are to be dispatched to every faction on Roedz, member worlds, border worlds and any other government where relations need improving.

This setting is perfect for Referees who wish to run a political campaign. The players can all be part of a diplomatic pack and will need a range of skill sets including diplomacy, investigation, piloting, and of course combat skills for those wanting to assume the role of personal security.

Rukh Wars For Referees wishing to run a war-based campaign, the confl ict between the Worlds of Leader Rukh and the Anti-Rukh Coalition provides an ideal setting. These two nations are always considered to be in a state of war but the actual extent of the hostilities is entirely at the Referee's discretion.

The story can begin when hostilities between the two empires are low with occasional border skirmishes or raiding of supply lines. As the story unfolds these confl icts become more and more frequent with the Anti-Rukh Coalition initiating a number of strategic raids into the territories of the Worlds of Leader Rukh, which will eventually lead to a full scale war. Alternatively, the story can begin when the war is in full fl ow and the players are plunged in the middle of the hostilities.

The difference between the two military forces is signifi cant. The Anti-Rukh Coalition has a much smaller force but with only six worlds their forces are consolidated and hold a strong position. The Worlds of Leader Rukh has a much bigger military but it is spread out over their vast territory. Mounting a full scale assault against the Coalition would leave many systems in the Worlds of Leader Rukh undefended and open to attack from any number of rivals.

There are numerous options for how the players get involved in the war. They could be military personnel for either side, a corsair band hired by the Anti-Rukh Coalition to raid worlds in Rukh territory or mercenaries for hire working for the highest bidder. With the latter option, there is a greater chance that the players could change allegiance to fi ght for a more charismatic leader part way through the campaign.

Another twist on this setting is for the players to be a group of free traders. As war increases it becomes more diffi cult and dangerous to make a profi t but one of the nations hires the players to transport food and supplies. This is a very dangerous job but one that pays extremely well. This opens up many possibilities for avoiding enemy vessels, being attacked and boarded or perhaps the players are spies working for the other side.

Corsair Raiding Corsair campaigns based in Gvurrdon sector are much the same as any other sector in the Extents and are detailed on page 177.

Players can be part of one of the established corsair bands previously detailed in this chapter or they could form a new band, rivalling one of the aforementioned groups. The level of adversary and rivals will depend on the subsector the players are based in. An overview is given here that lists each sector, which bands operate there and the frequency of their activity.

The Thought Police The Thirz Empire has always had trouble maintaining control of their people. Their use of undercover operatives is well known and the proximity to the Zhodani has led to numerous advances in Vargr psionics within the Empire. The Thirz Empire has a number of secret facilities where charismatic mentors train the psionic agents.

Agents are taught how to blend in with the citizens, using their abilities and skills to detect unhappy citizens and potential dissidents. This may seem un-Vargr like but there is a strong Zhodani infl uence to this culture and it also serves to highlights the diversity nature of Vargr society. It is also important to remember that citizens of the Thirz Empire do enjoy a lot of benefi ts and personal liberty; agents are paid well and they understand that to maintain these freedoms, uprisings must be prevented for the good of the larger pack.

This type of campaign can take players through their training as they learn new psionic abilities and skills, until they are given their fi rst assignment. Alternatively, the campaign can start with the players as more experienced agents and have just been assigned to a new area or world. During their investigations the players will discover a large number of disaffected Vargr are plotting to start a new uprising in the hope of seizing power.

A twist to this idea is that as the players uncover more about the dissident plot, government secrets are uncovered that make the players question their loyalties, ethics and motives. Will they continue to pursue the dissidents or will the players join them to fi ght the Thirz oppression?

Thrice Doomed For a human based campaign set in Gvurrdon sector, Referees need look no further than Triad in Uthe subsector (see page 165). The players are part of the military or a mercenary group and must deal with any of the three potential threats waiting to happen on Triad:

- The disaffected Vargr soon gain the support of all their
    brethren on Triad resulting in a civil war. The players must
    deal with terrorist attacks and guerrilla style warfare and
    could be working for either side.
- Tensions fl are between Triad and a neighboring
    government. Trade embargos are put in place and hostilities
    soon increase to border skirmishes and attacks on human
    transports. The players can be deployed in a number of
    roles including ground support, patrolling the borders and
    trade routes or even as diplomats.
- Corsair activity has increased in Uthe subsector with most
    of the raids being directed at Triad and human vessels. The
    players are assigned or hired to seek out and destroy the
    corsair band.

Warzone The Vargr have a tendency to repeat history, especially the violent and aggressive periods. Many of the scenarios previously detailed could spark a new series of wars that spread throughout Gvurrdon and beyond, much like the Gvegh Wars that began in –1760.

The most likely subsectors that this would occur in are Ksits Usathu or Aelluekh where rival corsair activity fuels hostilities between rival governments. The initial wars would most likely occur between the smaller states but would soon expand to include larger nations such as the Society of Equals, the Worlds of Leader Rukh and the Thoengling Empire. However, similar events could also occur in many other subsectors of Gvurrdon.

If such an event occurs, many of the smaller states will form new alliances to defend against the larger nations. The most powerful empires will expand and attack rival governments. New states will also emerge to fi ll the gaps left behind as nations are destroyed. Some corsair bands will take advantage of the situation and raid the weaker worlds, whilst others will be hired to bolster fl eets and defend smaller worlds.

The entire sector will become a warzone. Only the most skilled pilots will dare to fl y transport ships through hostile regions and trade will plummet. However, those merchants that do brave the trade routes will command higher fees and many will hire escort ships to ensure they arrive safely.

This event could also be the catalyst for a Third Diaspora. Vargr refugees from all nations will seek new and safer homes away from the regions of battle. Since most of the worlds on the spinward and rimward regions of Gvurrdon sector are controlled by the Imperium or the Zhodani the Vargr will most likely pillage on the way, raiding and settling on the border worlds and potentially starting a war with the Imperium or the Zhodani Consulate.

Vargr Archetypes There are four basic archetypes in Vargr society that provide good examples of typical Vargr personalities:

The Taker: This archetype focuses their efforts on material gain and wealth. Vargr that follow the Merchant career often adopt this mentality.

The Empire Builder: These Vargr are primarily concerned with obtaining power, seeking to dominate and secure the loyalty of other Vargr.

The Paranoid: This type of Vargr is suspicious and wary of others. Aware of the ever-changing Vargr nature, paranoid types tend to follow the path of the Loner so they do not have to place their trust and loyalty with anyone else.

The Prince: The fi nal archetype is for those who quickly gain Charisma and respect. They are the natural leaders whose personality is such that it secures great loyalty from the pack.

## VVAARGRRGR AANDND TTRRAVELLERAVELLER GGAAMESMES

This chapter details methods for using the Vargr race in your Traveller games and is intended primarily for the Referee, although players of Vargr characters may wish to refer to the Roleplaying Vargr section. Whether Referees wish to use a single loner or a Vargr pack travelling the Extents, there are certain factors that should be taken into consideration.

#### VARGR IN THE GAME

The Vargr mindset is very different to that of humans and most Vargr fi nd it diffi cult to comprehend human behaviour. Likewise, most humans do not understand the Vargr way of life either. When using Vargr characters in your game it is important that they behave and interact according to their natural traits and instincts. This may seem diffi cult to focus on since the Vargr are such a diverse race but the key points to remember are that Vargr are driven by charisma, racial pride and the need for companionship although the latter does not apply as much to loners.

When Vargr characters are dealing with people from other races, the Referee should think about the Vargr's motives for doing so. If a Vargr has no chance of gaining charisma or money then why are they involved? If not the promise of riches and notoriety then perhaps the Vargr is seeking the company of others or a worthy leader to follow. Patrons will generally hire non-Vargr characters if they feel that humans or other races are more suited to the task, especially if a shift in loyalty could jeopardise the patron's plans.

The Vargr are seen as inconsistent and even unstable by most other races but just because they behave this way does not mean they lack intelligence or act on a whim. Even reckless and dangerous actions (which are not uncommon amongst the Vargr) will have some rationale or reasoning behind them, most likely to improve their standing, an act of loyalty or confi rmation of their leadership abilities. Such deeds are more probable if an individual has recently lost face and must prove himself to his peers to regain his charisma.

Another important aspect to Vargr groups is their tendency for infi ghting and power struggles. Humans see this as unstable but Vargr loyalties do not change on a whim and there is always a good reason for a change of allegiance, whether it is a failure in the current leadership or the promise of greater riches and charisma from a more charismatic individual. Even if tempted by the latter situation, most Vargr will remain loyal to their current leader unless he has given them cause not to.

Vargr society might be turbulent, but most of the instability occurs at higher levels of authority, especially as leadership becomes more remote. Smaller groups of Vargr tend to be more stable once a charismatic individual has established himself as the pack leader. This means that specifi c tasks will usually get done regardless of power shifts occurring higher up the echelons of authority.

#### ROLEPLAYING VARGR

As a Vargr you are extremely proud of your heritage. You are the only major race that was uplifted by the Ancients – this makes you special and unique.

Unlike the other races you are not set in your ways or a slave to rules and regulations; you have complete freedom to do as you want and choose your destiny. If you are not happy with your job, change it. If you do not like where you live, move somewhere else. If your leader is not competent, look to another. If you think you are better than your leader, prove it and take his place.

Look around you at the other races. They are decadent, living in stagnant societies. Their leaders lack charisma and have not earned their positions by inspiring their men, thus they have no

true loyalty from their subordinates. These races live in relative isolation; they do not have the camaraderie of the Vargr pack and no racial pride unites them all in times of need.

You are Vargr. You give your loyalty without question to the most deserving leader. Charisma drives your every move. You desire to gain standing amongst your brethren and to rise up through the pack. You strive to succeed so your deeds earn you the respect and loyalty of your peers.

Never lose face. Failure and the loss of charisma should never be seen as a burden but an opportunity to prove yourself, regaining that which you lost and to become better than before; there is always strength to be found in adversity.

You are never alone. You can always turn to your pack in times of need. Your pack is one of your greatest strengths and will support you through the best and worst of times. Likewise, when your brethren turn to you for support you should always give it unconditionally.

Our leaders are another great strength. They command us, inspire us and praise us when our deeds deserve it. When our leaders are no longer able to effectively command their subordinates it is our responsibility to choose a replacement, thus ensuring that we always have the very best individuals to lead us to victory.

#### CAMPAIGNS

This section discusses campaigns that do not center wholly on Vargr affairs, but may include one or two Vargr Player Characters or have the Vargr race as a component.

Travellers for Hire The traditional type of Traveller game is where the players own their own starship and travel the galaxy as explorers, traders or looking for interesting patrons and ways to pay off their mortgage. Vargr characters can be part of such a crew for a number of reasons such as a loner who misses the company of others, a trader who has not made the fortunes he had hoped, a Vargr who grew up in the Imperium or simply a character who is fed up and wants to move on seeking a life of adventure.

This style of campaign also provides opportunities to take the players into Vargr space for a few sessions, to give them a taste of a very different culture to the Imperium:

- A human patron has discovered the small but lucrative
    market of selling Imperial robots to the Vargr. However,
    dealing in this market means he will be competing with the

corsairs who steal robots from Imperial territory and sell them on to the Vargr. Once the corsairs discover there is a new competitor, all attention will be focussed on the players and their cargo.

- A Vargr merchant or junk dealer has established a new
    warehouse in the Imperium where he plans to sell Imperial
    goods to the Vargr and Vargr goods to humans. He hires the
    players to transport goods between this warehouse and his
    main facility in the Extents.
- The players sign on with a megacorporation to establish new
    trade routes with the border worlds of Gvurrdon sector.

Bordering the Extents Gvurrdon sector and other regions that lie on the border of the Extents provide great scope for a campaign setting. The chaotic nature and constant change in Vargr politics is always a concern to the Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate. The threat of corsair raids is always present but these groups can also be hired as powerful allies should the need arise.

Worlds near the border are much more likely to have mixed races, some who co-exist in peace and others less so. Attitudes towards the Vargr will vary greatly from one world to the next, largely depending on the local history and current political climates.

- Trade routes near an independent world have been the victim
    of numerous corsair attacks. The local government does not
    have the resources to patrol beyond the immediate area and
    hire the players to track down the corsairs and prevent the
    attacks by any means necessary.
- A growing Vargr nation is expanding its borders close to
    several human worlds and the threat of war looms ever closer.
    The local governments are hiring mercenary bands to bolster
    their fl eets and armies. A number of border skirmishes take
    place whilst the players are on one of these planets and they
    are asked to sign up and help defend the region.
- As above but the local governments also need weapons and
    supplies. Merchant ships are being boarded by Vargr vessels
    so anyone bringing in arms must deal with the corsair bands
    blocking the trade routes.
- As above but the players are hired in a diplomatic role, either
    to escort government offi cials or to mediate disputes as an
    independent party.
- Tensions are escalating on a world with a mixed society of
    Vargr and humans. The world is governed by humans but
    the Vargr, led by a charismatic leader, are displeased with
    the current administration and are vying to take control. The
    players are hired to seek out and quell the dissidents.
- As above but the players are hired by the Vargr to help
    strengthen their number.

#### PRESENTING THE VARGR

There are many ways to present the Vargr race in a campaign, with the most common detailed below. Referees are encouraged to create more and to vary the attitudes of Vargr within their games to help illustrate the diversity of the race.

Vargr as Ally The Vargr look for strong leadership from charismatic individuals and even non-Vargr can fulfi l this role if they have suffi cient charisma and have an understanding of the Vargr mindset. So long as superiors maintain their infl uence and work closely with their subordinates, the Vargr can be extremely powerful allies who will support their leaders in all regards.

The Vargr also make excellent leaders, able to inspire their subordinates to perform great deeds. Such charismatic individuals might be seeking to enlarge their pack, creating a mercenary group or commanding military units. For these Vargr the desire to lead is even greater than the desire to follow such a leader.

Emphasise: Loyalty, camaraderie, charisma and leadership. Inspiration: The Narn from Babylon 5.

Vargr as Mercenary Vargr mercenary bands are hired by governments, military groups, corporations and even civilians if they have enough money. Where there are Vargr there are always mercenaries, especially on worlds bordering the Extents. Whatever people may think of the Vargr, their mercenary bands are very effective and highly sought after. However, only the most charismatic of employers can be assured of their loyalty.

When presenting the Vargr as mercenaries it is important to establish that these groups can be friend or foe, depending on who they are working for. Many mercenaries have low moral standards and will take almost any job if the money is good enough or the employer is suffi ciently charismatic and infl uential.

Emphasise: Combat effectiveness, reputation and diversity. Inspiration: The crew of Firefl y

Vargr as Mysterious Other The Vargr mindset can be diffi cult to comprehend and it is not uncommon for some races to view them as anarchic and aggressive, yet their violence is not necessarily directed toward other races. Their ways are foreign to outsiders and the fact that their race spans so many sectors but has no centralised government baffl es many. Their constant infi ghting for leadership and power is often perceived as barbaric or tribal, yet their racial pride and desire for companionship seems diametrically opposed.

Emphasise: Infi ghting, racial pride, packs and gregariousness. Inspiration: The Klingons from Star Trek.

Vargr as Threat The Vargr are most known for their many corsair bands that raid border worlds, both within and outside of the Extents. Territory and borders are of no concern to the Vargr and continued raids against poorly defended worlds and unpatrolled trade routes are commonplace near Vargr worlds. The jockeying for power within these corsair bands can make such groups unpredictable, increasing the threat to the local economy and stability.

Emphasise: Raids and piracy. Inspiration: The Zenetan pirates from Farscape.

Vargr as Enemy The Vargr can be a very violent race and their lack of respect for rules and borders has led to many hostilities with neighboring governments of all races, including their own. Anti-Vargr sentiments also remain in some regions and this will also add to increasing tensions. When the Vargr fi ght in such wars their attacks are brutal and relentless.

Emphasise: Savage and constant attacks. Inspiration: The Chigs from Space: Above and Beyond.

Journey to the Extents To fully experience Vargr society, the players can be sent on a long mission into the Vargr Extents. The players could start off in the Spinward Marches or other Imperial sector and must travel across the border into Gvurrdon sector or another region in the Extents.

Potential threats include warring Vargr nations, corsair raids and hostile reactions from Vargr with anti-human sentiments.

- The players are hired by a Vargr merchant who is returning
    to the Extents. They are to transport him and his goods to
    one of the inner sectors of the Suedzuk region where he
    has family who can help established his new enterprise.
- The players are hired by the Imperium to gather intelligence
    about the inner regions of the Extents. The players can use
    a number of different cover stories such as explorers, a
    mercenary band or traders.
- A rogue agent has escaped the Imperium and is headed into
    the Extents. Whether he plans to simply start a new life or
    share his Imperial knowledge is unknown. The players are
    hired to track him down and return him to Imperial custody.

#### VARGR CAMPAIGNS

Referees who want to run an all-Vargr campaign have a wealth of options using settings within the Extents or in the territories of other races. A party consisting only of Vargr characters allows players to fully explore what it means to be Vargr; charisma, infi ghting, gregariousness, loyalty and leadership will be all be required by the characters.

The group dynamics alone can occupy much of the story as each player seeks to lead the pack. Loyalties will change and new leaders will be chosen, but at the end of the day the pack must still come fi rst and their racial pride and camaraderie will win through when the situation requires it.

Referees may wish to limit the infi ghting and should keep it realistic within the bounds of Vargr tradition. Unless there is a particularly power hungry character, once a leader has been chosen the pack will be relatively stable until that individual fails in his role. Infi ghting amongst subordinates should generally be handled as friendly rivalry and will usually only come into play as individuals gain or lose Charisma, thus altering the dynamics of the group once more.

Corsairs Many Vargr dream of becoming corsairs from when they are young pups, earning the fear and respect of their people. A life of adventure and raiding is very appealing to the Vargr mindset and can provide some exciting campaigns.

The most successful corsair bands always have a strong leader who is both skilled and charismatic. Inexperienced and weak leaders do not last long in this line of work. Once a leader has proven himself, pack members will become very loyal unless some pre-existing rivalry exists between them. Corsair bands do not experience as much infi ghting and jockeying for power as is common in other packs – the stability of these groups is greater than the Vargr military.

Aside from the thrill of raiding, this setting can be very appealing to the Referee and players if they want to focus more on raiding and other story arcs, rather than infi ghting with each other. However, should the leader fail his men, they will resort to more typical Vargr behaviour.

This setting can be run as a freeform campaign where the players are free to go and do as they please. Referees can add side scenarios and encounters as required to make the game interesting and can also build toward a story that gradually draws the players into a larger plot.

- The players could start out as traders or mercenaries who
    are attacked and boarded by pirates. During the confl ict
    they are taken captive or a stalemate is reached. The
    corsair leader then invites the players to join his band. The
    players now have two choices – fi ght or join.
- The players raid a ship carrying a Vargr emissary or alien
    diplomat. If this individual is captured, killed or otherwise
    detained from his negotiations it could result in the loss
    of a major business deal, political hostilities between rival
    nations or even war. The emissary will plead with the
    players to get him to his destination – failure to do so could
    have far reaching consequences that will affect the players
    and the territories they raid.
- A rival corsair band is competing with the players over
    a popular and lucrative trade route. Perhaps one band
    encroached on the other's territory or maybe they both saw
    the opportunity when new trade routes were established.
    Whatever the reason, these evenly matched groups will
    each seek to dominate raiding activity in this region and
    confl icts are inevitable.
- A charismatic leader from a growing corsair band meets with
    the players, giving them an opportunity to become part of
    his fl eet. Will the players join this powerful group or decline
    the offer, making a potential enemy in the process?
- The players have become notorious raiders, respected
    by some and feared by many. Several worlds are losing
    trade due to the risk of merchants and cargo ships being
    attacked. One government tries a diplomatic approach
    and dispatches an emissary but the rest take a more direct
    approach, hiring mercenaries and rival corsair bands to
    hunt down the players. How will the players deal with their
    many enemies?

Mercenaries In some regards, this is similar to the corsair setting but the characters will most likely have different ethics or at least be more mindful of upsetting local governments and law enforcement agencies. Mercenary groups are very common in the Extents and will take whichever job pays the most or has the most charismatic employer.

The rise and fall of governments and the continuing shifts in power often result in the less established governments having limited military forces, so they hire mercenaries to perform a variety of roles including military support, espionage, investigations and diplomatic escorts. Corporations also hire mercenaries for much the same reasons. When mercenary groups are not available or large numbers are required, governments and organizations might also seek help from corsair bands.

- The players are hired by a small government to help defend
    their world or to fi ght in a war against an enemy nation. The
    government can be Vargr or an independent human world
    that has become embroiled in hostilities with its neighbors.
    The players could therefore be fi ghting other Vargr or
    humans.
- The players visit a world where Vargr dissidents have
    gained popularity and the struggle for power has led to
    political turmoil within the government. One of the factions
    hires the players to assassinate their rival leader.
- The players have been hired to fi ght an enemy of
    the employer – this could be a corsair band or a rival
    government. During the confl ict, the players are offered a
    better opportunity from the opposing side – this could take
    the form of a greater payment or a more charismatic leader.
    Will the players remain loyal or betray their employer?

Military Vargr military groups vary from one world to another and even within the divisions of a single military force there can be much diversity. A military campaign can be the foundation of a long running campaign, especially once the government becomes involved in continued hostilities with rival nations or corsair bands.

As the players are sent on missions they will rise in rank and popularity. Borders will shift and political power will change, providing many opportunities for the players to change allegiance if their leader proves to be weak or loses face.

- There has been an increase in corsair raids on several
    worlds belonging to the government. The players assigned
    as one of several groups who must patrol the system and
    prevent further attacks.
       - Hostilities are increasing with a rival government and the
          players are stationed at a border outpost. Before the full
          contingent of troops, equipment and supplies arrive, the
          outpost is attacked. The players must defend the outpost
          against superior numbers until reinforcements arrive. This
          attack by the enemy is a declaration of war and the fi rst of
          many battles to come.
       - The government is planning on expanding their territory.
          They are looking for new worlds rich in minerals, regardless
          of whether they are already inhabited. The players are
          tasked with escorting a prospector and fi nding a suitable
          planet. They are to stay under the radar if possible but
          should that prove diffi cult then a more forceful approach
          has been authorized.
       - The government is at war with a neighboring state and is
          planning an assault. The players' new mission is to establish
          a beachhead within enemy territory before the main attack
          force is deployed.
       - The military is planning a pre-emptive strike against their
          enemy but need further intelligence before they can
          proceed. The players must fi nd their way deep into enemy
          territory, determine the strength of the defences and return
          with the information.

Emissaries A rather different approach to a Vargr campaign is to focus on the political aspects of Vargr society. With the constant changes in leadership and political status, the players will have to be alert and ready to cope with a variety of situations from business deals to peace treaties.

The party can consist of an emissary (the pack leader), a number of aides and even bodyguards if the players will be entering dangerous situations. Some of these characters might also serve as the ship's crew if the Referee requires a self- dependent party with their own ship.

- A large corporation is monopolising the market. A coalition of
    smaller companies have allied together and hired the players
    to mediate discussions with the large corporation. The
    coalition hopes to come to a mutually benefi cial arrangement
    where all the businesses can profi t.
- Corsair attacks on a nearby human world have caused
    political problems for the local government. The players are
    hired to mediate a settlement before hostilities increase.
    However, there are factions within both governments who
    think a border war would serve their own agendas, so the
    players must walk a dangerous path as they attempt to
    resolve the situation.

- The local government has been at war with a neighboring
    state for some time. As a result, the economy is failing,
    civilians are leaving and those that remain are losing faith
    in their leaders. The players are hired to negotiate a peace
    treaty so both nations can tend their wounds and rebuild their
    empires. Reparations will be needed, territories ceded and
    borders will change. Can the players end the war and reach
    an agreement that is mutually benefi cial to both sides?

Traders Trade is the lifeblood of the Vargr nations with over half of all goods being second hand. Without the junk dealers and scroungers many companies would simply not exist. The second hand market is more competitive than brand new goods but merchants of both markets have their fair share of rivals and threats.

- The players have a hold full of perishable goods but the
    starport has been locked down due to political unrest on the
    planet. They must either fi nd a way to end the situation (not
    an easy task) or discover how to break the lockdown and
    fl ee before they are caught by the police or naval patrols.
- The players have acquired some valuable cargo but fear
    a rival merchant might try to appropriate it or even pay a
    corsair band to liberate it. The players must fi nd a way to
    transport their cargo safely and securely.
- The players are offered illegal goods at very low prices. If
    they can shift the merchandise offworld they would make
    a substantial profi t. Will they purchase the goods and risk
    getting caught or will they turn down an opportunity to make
    them rich?

Explorers There are many systems and regions in the Extents that remain unexplored. Loners, prospectors and explorers often set course for these uncharted territories to fi nd new worlds and rich mineral deposits. Vargr packs looking to start their own colonies and religious cults also explore these regions in the hope of fi nding a new home without impinging the borders of established nations.

Much of the Vargr Enclaves still remain unexplored, inhabited by small settlements of outcast Vargr packs. Very little is known of how these scattered settlements have evolved and many may not have survived at all. Likewise, there are numerous worlds in the coreward region of the Extents that have yet to be fully explored and colonized.

- The players are hired by a prospector who needs a support
    crew for a lengthy expedition into the Enclaves. His goal
    is to fi nd untapped mineral resources that can be sold to
    mining companies.
- A Vargr scientist hires the players to take him to the
    Enclaves. The scientist wants to study what subspecies of
    Vargr still remain and how they have evolved and adapted
    to their isolation and environment.
- A group of Vargr looking for a new life plan to start a
    new settlement away from the overpopulated and
    confl ict driven areas of the Extents. They need a ship to
    transport them and fi nd a suitable home, or alternatively
    they require an escort in case they run into corsairs or
    other threats on the journey.

Callously viewed by other races as thieves, vagabonds and pirates, the wolf-like Vargr are a complex and varied race whose society is light years beyond their stereotype. Alien Module 2: Vargr peels back the layers of prejudice to reveal a fascinating race who have a powerful effect on their region of the galaxy.

The Vargr are the only major race to have been uplifted by the Ancients, a fact that the Vargr are extremely proud

of. They are typically seen by other races as aggressive pirates and scavengers but the Vargr actually have a diverse culture that is deeply rooted in their pack mentality and the desire for companionship, charisma and loyalty. Their constant struggle for charisma and leadership results in a culture fuelled by confl ict and change.

This book is packed with information for both players and referees. New rules for careers allow players to create their own Vargr characters, which are then well served by technology and ships designed by and for the Vargr. Chapters are devoted to playing a Vargr and how their society and culture are structured. Finally, we have also included a complete sector to explore, meshing seamlessly with the Spinward Marches – the Gvurrdon sector.

To use this supplement, a Referee will require the Traveller Core Rulebook.
