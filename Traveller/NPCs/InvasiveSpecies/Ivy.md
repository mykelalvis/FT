CHAMBERLAIN Ivy Golba
[[Vilani]] Female 31 (796B6A)
![[Ivy_Portrait.jpg]]

Ivy is new to her role of chamberlain to [[Okhotnikov|the ducal heir]] but is taking to it well. She has served the ducal family for just over a year, is ambitious and, with the duke’s chamberlain retiring soon, has confidence that she can ascend the administrative ranks of House Okhotnikov.
