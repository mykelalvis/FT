The meson transceivers are lightweight, thin and unobtrusive. Users may subvocalise if discretion is required. The device picks up the vibrations of the mandible, tongue and nasal passages to produce a simulated voice transmission with nearly 100-percent accuracy. Meson devices penetrate all matter and are almost impossible to jam.
