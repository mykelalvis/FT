As the daughter of [[Emperor Strephon Aella Alkhalikoi|Emperor Strephon]] and [[Empress Iolanthe Alkhalikoi|Empress Iolanthe]], Ciencia Iphegenia is the Grand Princess of the Imperium. As heir to the [[Iridium Throne]], Ciencia has been educated from birth to eventually assume the mantle of authority, much like her father did before her. She shares her mother's keen intellect and has been imbued with a strong sense of duty to the Imperium by her father.

Ciencia developed a remarkable interest in the sciences early in childhood, memorising all of the constellations and component stars visible from [[Capital]] by the age of five. Her aptitudes in the realms of the space sciences have many historians likening her to her ancestor, Arbellatra Alkhalikoi, who became a naval captain at the age of 16. After graduating from the prestigious Karbiili School on [[Capital]] at the age of 10, Ciencia joined the [[Scout Service]] and completed basic training at the age of 12. She has since become the leading patron of the IISS and travels frequently to Core scout bases and their operational headquarters at Reference where she also attends courses at the University of Aadkhien. Whether or not she becomes the 'Arbellatra of the Scout Service' remains to be seen but there is ample reason to believe she will have an illustrious career with the IISS, possibly following it up with a stint at one or more of the Imperial Research Stations before she eventually sits upon the throne.
