# ARAMANX

Aramanx is a balkanised world at the edge of the Towers Cluster of the [[Aramis subsector]]. Its population of two billion is divided among eight major (and at least 20 minor) mutually hostile nations. Aramanx has become known as a the 'powder keg of the [[Towers Cluster]]', with clashes becoming increasingly common in recent years.

Recent efforts to reduce tensions have been at least partially successful and some states have pulled back from the brink of outright war. A state of watchful tension exists in many areas, with occasional punitive raids and border clashes, which are quickly brought under control. It seems that most states want to avoid the all-out global conflict that seems to be the inevitable result if the powder keg ignites.

Aramanx (G605 B65'/974-6) is a balkanized world at the edge of the [[Towers Cluster]], colonized in the 400's ([[IY338]]) by settlers from [[Junidy]]. The initial colonists were a utopian group who attempted to eliminate warfare by returning man to a simpler state of existence. The technology required to construct fusion power plants, gravitic drives, and nuclear bombs was renounced, leaving the colonists at [[TechLevel 6|TL-6]].

As later generations spread out across the planet, schisms developed and war was reintroduced: gradually, under the pressures of nationalism, all of the old beliefs died except for the traditional hostility to new technology. Now even that is fading as offworld contact begins to make high technology the price of national survival, although a large segment of the population in every nation remains hostile to the new ways (and to the offworlders who bring them).

The planet is an average sized world with a thin atmosphere: 70% of its surface is covered by water. The five major continents include a varied, but generally rugged terrain which has further encouraged the world's characteristic balkanizaticn.

Aramanx has a population of 1.6 billion people spread across eight major, and at least twenty minor, mutually independent nations, each with its own government, laws. and society. The overall law level of 4 applies strictly to the orbital facility which serves as the starport for Aramanx. This [[Class B Starport]], completed only within the last ten years, was financed by a consortium of [[Imperium|Imperial]] commercial concerns at the urging of [[Sternmetal Horizons]]. LIC. which has a heavy interest in Aramanx.

## Aramanx Starport

The welter of different nationalities and loyalties on Aramanx made it inevitable. perhaps, that starport facilities would never be established on the planetary surface. The orbital starport, secure from the potential problems of a final explosion in the delicate political and diplomatic situation. is able to deal with all nations on an equal, impartial footing.

Starships are not permitted to land on Aramanx save at their own risk, and the technology of the planet makes any form of service or supply out of the question. Usual procedure calls for ships to dock at [[#Aramanx Starport]] (or enter orbits near the facility), and then use shuttles to gain access to the planetary surface. All of the major powers, and many of the most important minor ones. are serviced via shuttle on a daily basis, usually to each nation's capital city. Shuttle passage costs Cr8 per person, or Cr15 per person for special runs. made once each day. to specific cities. The cheaper version takes 1D x 30 minutes to reach any particular destination, since a normal shuttle will make several stops at different cities.

Attitudes toward offworlders vary considerably from place to place (although every nation has its quota of anti-technologists). [[#Senled]], for example, is characterized by a certain degree of xenophobia, thanks to a general feeling that it was offworld interests which brought about the economic and political problems of the nation. [[#Lovrenyi]], and several of the less militant states on the other continents of the world, have a much less hostile reaction. Despite the force of tradition and the meddling of [[Sternmetal Horizons]] the people of Aramanx are coming to realize that their future rests with the stars. not with a planet increasingly subject to competition, paranoia, and outright hostility.


## Sternmetal

It is only in the years since [[Sternmetal Horizons]] first began to open the world to extensive offworld contact that the planet has begun to advance, but it remains incapable of producing fusion power, grav technology, or even primitive atomic weapons. Extensive industrialization has kept pace with the rapid population growth of the last century or so, and Aramanx is widely believed to be perched on the edge of a crisis period which could see the world blossom into arival to Aramis or Junidy, or explode into a dangerous and world-encompassing war.

[[Sternmetal Horizons]], LIC, has recently (within the last decade) embarked upon a program of exploitation of Ararnanx along ambitious lines. Deciding that a straight economic takeover of the planet would (given the complexities and variety of politics and political bodies on the world) involve too great an outlay of funds, [[Sternmetal Horizons|Sternmetal]] has systematically invested in Lovrenyi, a smallish (population 37 million) industrialized nation in the midst of the most heavily industrialized and settled continent. Sternmetal has introduced a small but well-equipped mercenary contingent to supplement indigenous Lovrenyi troops, with the plan of defeating the conventional armies of the major powers. thus enabling imposition of terms favorable for a wholesale infiltration of their economies by Sternmetal investment.

## Bheroven

The linked continents of Bheroven and East Bheroven dominate Aramanx in geographical and political importance. Sixty percent of the planet's population. and over eighty percent of its industry, is centered on these two continents. As the political map of Aramanx shows, the two continents are divided into four major powers lfive when Lovrenyi's budding empire is countedl and a number of smaller nations maintaining a tenuous survival, threatened constantly by their larger neighbors.

On Bheroven proper, two major powers-the Republic of Lanax (which is governed by a self-perpetuating oligarchy) and the Union of Senled (a democracy currently under a martial law situation)-are of most importance. Lineeza, another major power, straddles Bheroven and East Bheroven, but is largely occupied by persistent border threats from Staxl. which is further east still. in addition. of course, there is Lovrenyi, which now dominates the minor powers of Dalelo and Flenitza. plus several smaller nations in the same region. This combined power amounts to another major country. but internal problems (particularly in Renitzal continue to hamper Lovrenyi's organization. A scattering of lesser states on the north coast completes the picture of Bheroven's political structures.

The military junta of Lovrenyi, backed by Sternrnetal money and the prestige of their expanded armed forces, has recently concluded an alliance with Senled, largely directed at keeping the latter from intervening in the delicate situation in Renitza. Though the alliance is basically one of mutual non-aggression and friendship, reports of secret terms have surfaced. These would seem to call for a partition of the petty northern states, and economic aid (provided by Sternmetall for Sen|ed's fragile and tottering government. The alliance is also designed to freeze out Lenax, which has a tradition of enmity towards Senled, and is now faced with the possibility of fighting both its neighbors in a crisis situation. Although a paper agreement between Lanax and Lineeza exists, independent observers widely believe that the latter would probably not honor its commitments in a crisis.

For the past year, a fitful undeclared war has been waged along the frontier between Senled and Lanax. This war has largely consisted of a series of raids staged back and forth across the border. Both sides have hesitated to do more than simple retaliatory actions. fearing that a more general mobilization of forces will trigger a major confrontation. Thus the raids, though sometimes conducted on a large scale with fairly severe effects, are not perceived as an immediate cause for alarm. Peace talks, sponsored by Lovrenyi and mediated by offworld representatives appointed by the Starport Board of Governors, are now in their eighth month, but suspicions that the mediators are themselves interested in obtaining an advantage on Aramanx have tended to hinder substantial progress.
## The Terrain of Bheroven

Bheroven is divided roughly in half by the Vendor mountain chain. which cuts in a diagonal slash from southwest to northeast, and helps define the borders of Lanax, Senled. Lovrenyi, Renitza, and Staxl. The mountains are not themselves particularly imposing (Mt. Zairin, the highest peak on the continent, is a relatively small 3276 meters above sea level). Much of the surrounding terrain, however. is rugged, and still includes considerable areas of wilderness despite the burgeoning of poputation and industrialization on the continent.

### Senled

The Union of Senled, which occupies the northwestern quarter of Bheroven, is one of the oldest and most powerful of the states on Aramanx, though it has recently fallen on hard times. An abortive coup staged nine years ago by dissidents (whom many believe were supported financially by Sternmetal Horizons) came very close to toppling the rather weak government of President Deneel Zarqod. In the wake of this coup, the nation suffered heavily: strikes, riots, and a general economic upheaval were followed by repression and martial law. which were made more difficult by intermittent outbreaks of war or near-war with neighboring Lanax. The nation has thus far weathered the storm, but is now close to the brink of collapse. Recent economic aid from Sternrnetal Horizons (following the treaty with Lovrenyil has begun to renovate the economy somewhat, but inflation continues to run at something over 90% per year. and martial law restrictions are stiil in effect.

The military forces of Senled (26 divisions of infantry and several armor brigades) have been augmented by three regiments of mercenaries brought in from the Regina and Fihyianor subsectors. Of these, roughly two-thirds are deployed along the Lanaxian border, with the remainder in other border provinces or held in a central reserve around the capital.

### Lanax

Long established as a rival to Settled, the Republic of Lanax has the strongest conventional military force on Aramanx. and dominated Bheroven politics until the rise of Lovrenyi. Originally a representative democracy headed by an Administrative Council which selected three triennially elected, co-equal heads of state. Lanax underwent a period of political upheaval some seventy years ago that ended in a major political reform. Though the outward forms of government remain as before, power is essentially vested strictly in members of the Klaven family, who dominate the elections in such a way as to return family members to at least two of the three seats of the triumvirate each term. The Council now serves as little more than a rubber stamp. and the "republican" forms. of popular representation have been reduced to little more than a shadow of their former power.

Lanax is economically prosperous, and the Klavens have reigned with a relatively loose hand in most areas of personal freedom. It is a fairly popular and stable regime (though by no means as well-loved as the first Klaven governments. in the years when the talented family provided badly needed leadership in the dark days of the Fourth Bheroven Wars). Now growing increasingly isolated diplomatically. the current. government has quite correctly foreseen the threat posed by Lovrenyi and its growing alliance, and has taken action to offset the menace.

The army of Lanax, after a progressive building program, now includes some 40 infantry divisions (including specialty forces such as the North Mountain Division and several amphibious units), plus twelve armored divisions. In addition, Lanax has secured the services of a number of offworld mercenary units (apparently with the support of a Sternmetal competitor [[Ling Standard Products]]). These forces include an armored brigade. a company of commandos, and, most recently, several contingents of Vargr corsairs. The armed forces are concentrated most heavily in the region where Lanax, Senled, Lovrenyi, and Fienitza come together, though the entire border is adequately garrisoned, as well.


### Tavanix

The frontier city of Tavanix (population 81,000) lies a scant 30 kilometers from the Lanaxian border (and is less than 50 kilometers from the border with l'-lenitzal'Lovrenyil. [[Capital]] of the province of Tavinira, the city land the province) has passed back and forth between Lanax and SenIed several times in the last three centuries and was once (about 90 years ago) briefly independent of both. By and large, however, the people have considered themselves Senledian in culture and society throughout that period, and welcomed their return to the Union at the close of the Fourth Bheroven War 66 years ago.
![[CT-TTA-155.jpg|200]]

Since the most recent period of economic collapse, international tension, and martial law, Tavanix has managed better than many other parts of the country. a surprising situation considering the proximity of Lanax and the occasional frontier incidents that have characterized the past few years. In fact, however, it is that very proximity to danger which has helped the province and the city to stay afloat. The threat of war is very real here, and resistance to martial law edicts is far less than in other parts of the country. Heavy military recruitment for local forces and the stimulus of the military presence in the area have reduced unemployment and kept the economy somewhat better balanced than elsewhere.

This does not mean that Tavanix is particulariy well off. Unrest is far from unknown, and periodic raids, bombings, or long-range shellings are an all too common occurrence. In many ways, Tavanix resembles a city under siege, the people hungry, the town marred by fresh scars, the military presence constantly visible.
