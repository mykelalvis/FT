# Black Hole CX-01Y

Black holes are extremely dangerous phenomena, not merely due to their intense gravitational field. They also emit radiation of various sorts which can be very dangerous. Fortunately, they are quite rare and are mostly very distant from Charted Space. The Black Hole designated CX-01Y has been known for some time but has not been the subject of close study due to the long voyage required to reach it. As Black Holes go, CX-01Y is relatively small and ‘quiet’ in terms of electromagnetic emissions. Indeed, it does not quite fit the profile of other Black Holes of a similar estimated mass.

This anomaly has piqued the interest of various interstellar states, resulting in a series of expeditions to study it. Each was a difficult undertaking, with various corporations and states using different approaches. The usual one has been to send a primary scientific craft supported by several logistics vessels which then make the long trip home to bring more supplies. This ties up a lot of ships and personnel to support a small research effort, but it is the only option available to most states.

The Imperial Interstellar Scout Service undertook a mammoth effort to create a more substantial research project using three huge jump-capable tugs to haul a base craft plus supporting equipment all the way out to CX-01Y. The base craft is a converted light carrier which had become surplus to the needs of the navy. Stripped of its jump drives and heavily modified, the vessel was conveyed into proximity with CX-01Y. Its powerful


m-drive enables it to maintain its orbit and change position, acting as a mobile base for smaller manned and unmanned craft to approach the Black Hole itself. The three tugs now ply the long run back and forth with supplies and replacement personnel, with most scientists and Scouts serving for a year or so aboard the base ship before rotating home. Some have been there much longer but the strain of being cooped up in a starship, even a big one, eventually tells on even the most dedicated personnel.


The carrier/base ship is capable of docking and supporting a range of smaller craft, enabling some smaller research operations to extend their time on station considerably. The base ship has also rescued various missions that got into trouble, though sometimes there is no way to save a ship that gets too close or is blasted by an unexpected radiation burst. These distractions from the ship’s own mission have been criticised, but leaving fellow spacefarers to die is unpalatable at best, and in most cases there have been benefits in terms of shared research or donations in cash or kind from grateful crews or their backers, who know it is in their best interests to make friends with the group most likely to save their enormously expensive asset if something goes wrong.


CX-01Y has been described as one of the loneliest places in the universe; a cluster of starships orbiting a hostile object in the middle of nowhere. Indeed, a spinoff of the main mission is a psychological research project to investigate the long-term effects of such





isolation. In the meantime, the mission continues to produce more questions than answers, such as why CX-01Y differs from other Black Holes. One idea, which was initially ridiculed but is now beginning to gain some credibility, is that the Black Hole was manufactured by some incredibly advanced race. Whether or not this was the Ancients is one question this raises, but more importantly scientists are starting to wonder how it was done... and why.


Research at CX-01Y has implications for gravitics technology, among other fields, in the more well- frequented areas of Charted Space, and personnel who have done a tour there or on the support ships can be encountered in many areas. A surprisingly large number of Scout Service personnel go on Detached Duty after a tour at CX-01Y. Most will say that they just want to see some places and meet some people after their lonely assignment, but some tell dark tales of their time at the Black Hole research facility. They will claim that there is some malevolent force at work there, and insist that this is not merely the fearsome natural phenomenon they were studying. It was something more, and a few will even go so far as to say something evil.


The Black Hole research project might be a distant thing to the average band of Travellers, though one of them might have been there during prior surface. They might encounter strange technologies developed at remote installations as a spinoff from the project, or scientists who claim they have learned secrets of the universe from their time at CX-01Y. There might even be a project to create an artificial Black Hole, since research at CX-01Y suggests that it might be possible. There is also the possibility that researchers might have found something orbiting the Black Hole; something strange that should not have been there.
