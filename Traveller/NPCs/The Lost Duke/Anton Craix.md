A veteran of the Imperial army and former member of the [[Steel Scythe]] mercenary company, Anton Craix cut his teeth in warfare and only truly feels at home when serving someone else's cause. His time with Steel Scythe ended when he was part of an operation that led to the deaths of dozens of innocent civilians and while the Imperial courts acquitted him, he had difficulty finding work due to the publicity of the trial. An outcast, he finally found opportunity when he met Alistair and found a kindred spirit. Craix rose quickly in [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]] and is now [[Alistair Humbolt|the Lost Duke]]'s right-hand man. While he is not an evil man, Craix is loyal to a fault and respects his employer enough to be willing to do whatever is asked of him.
