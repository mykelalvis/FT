# RASATT

Rasatt is a dry world with a dense atmosphere lying right on the border of the [[Zhodani Consulate]]. It has never been incorporated, probably for lack of value. Almost the entire population of around 90,000 live in a single city that bears the same name as the host world. The rest of the planet is wilderness. Rasatt (the city, although this applies to the world as a whole) is a dangerous mid-tech free-for-all, with gangs and local leaders controlling a few streets each of the run-down city. There is no law enforcement, although each group imposes its own rules on the areas it controls. Conduct tolerated can vary from street-to-street.

Rasatt is a haven for outcasts and criminals, and an area of interest for several intelligence agencies. In addition to hunting down the worst of the fugitives, intelligence teams assigned to Rasatt attempt to gather information on what is happening over the border. It has been claimed that virtually every tramp merchant ship that uses Rasatt's so-called starport is in the pay of at least one intelligence agency, and that more than half the street gangs are composed of covert operatives. This is surely an exaggeration but it is an open secret that a quiet intelligence war is going on in the alleys and slums of Rasatt.
