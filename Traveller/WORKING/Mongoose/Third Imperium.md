# INTRODUCTION

The Third Imperium is the primary empire of [[Charted Space]], spread out over a vast region of space, consisting of all or part of 28 sectors, an empire of over 11,000 worlds inhabited by over 18 trillion sophonts of various human and alien races.

Many Travellers are familiar with the [[Spinward Marches]] and its neighboring sectors, [[Deneb]], [[the Trojan Reach]] and [[Reft Sector]]. These sectors are on the frontier, located 'behind the Claw' of the Great Rift, a massive region devoid of stars that separates the domain from the heart of the Imperium. While the Marches are mostly Imperial territory, they are far from the Imperial core. Others may be familiar with the Solomani Rim, the origin sector of Humaniti. A little more than a century ago, the Imperium fought the greatest war in its 1,000-year history against the Solomani, conquering a quarter of its territory including Terra itself. In modern times, the Imperium remains in Solomani space as an occupying force.

[[[[Core sector]] ]], the seat of empire, is a far different place. These are the hallowed grounds where the Third Imperium was born from the ashes of the [[Long Night]]. The drama of Imperial history has played out in this storied sector and it has the scars to show for it. Core has endured dynastic crises, betrayals, assassinations, a civil war that nearly tore it apart and the agony of defeat in war. It has also experienced rebirth, survival, astrographic and economic growth, the ascendance of dozens of Emperors, technological advancement and the joy of victory over worthy foes. The crucible of time has burned away the utopian dreams of its first Emperor and yet his Imperium lives on. At its heart, the Imperium was intended to be a sprawling free-trade zone, its worlds free to chart their own fates within well- defended borders. This it has achieved. The Imperium has proven to be a worthy successor to the previous great empires.

The Imperium is an immense polity with a complex history. Within these pages, Referees and Travellers alike will find a detailed history of the Imperium and descriptions of its military forces, the feudal nobility who administer its worlds, the megacorporations that dominate its economy and other aspects of Imperial society. Also contained herein is a complete description of [[Core sector]] , the heart of the Imperium and the location of its grandiose capital. Core is a remarkably diverse and turbulent place where Travellers will find abundant opportunities for adventure.

Amid all of the history, world data and background information, there are new playable alien and minor human races, weapons and gear, vehicles and starships. All of these can be used to add colour and detail to any Traveller campaign.

## Who Should Read This Book

The Third Imperium is written primarily with the Referee in mind. All of the information contained herein can be used by the Referee to run an adventure or campaign anywhere in Imperial space but most especially [[Core sector]] . Most of its world, starship and equipment descriptions do not include spoilers that will ruin the enjoyment of a gaming session for  Travellers. However, it does contain some secrets, patron encounters and other elements, which the Referee might prefer to keep from the Travellers to enhance their enjoyment of the game. Nevertheless, the book does have volumes of information that Travellers might enjoy reading and allowing them to obtain this knowledge before a gaming session might enhance their experience and prevent the Referee from having to narrate the various bits of history, library data and other factoids. For Travellers who want to read _The Third Imperium_ , most of the sections leading up to [[Core sector]]  are safe territory. Avoid reading any patron encounters or NPC descriptions so that the Referee may use them. Most of the world descriptions in the [[Core sector]]  section are safe to read as well but there are secrets and interesting facts sprinkled within those pages that Referees might want to surprise Travellers with. Consult the Referee before delving into the various subsector and world descriptions.

## Conventions

This book uses a number of conventions that require explanation. The Third Imperium refers to the third great human empire, which has now lasted for over 1,000 years. Its predecessors were the [[Ziru Sirka]] and the [[Rule of Man]], now nominally called the [[First Imperium]] and [[Second Imperium]], respectively. In the Vilani language, Ziru Sirka means Grand Empire of the Stars. This empire lasted for many thousands of years, predating Terran starflight by several millennia. The Rule of Man was its successor state, established by [[Terra]]n conquerors who defeated the decaying Ziru Sirka during the Interstellar Wars. The Terrans and their progeny eventually came to call themselves [[Solomani]], a name that invoked their star of origin but also reflected that after a few centuries they hailed from many worlds and were no longer just Terrans. The Third Imperium is often simply called the [[Imperium]] since it refers to the current human empire.

In _Traveller_ , Humaniti consists of a broad panoply of subspecies. It is believed that an alien race known as [[The Ancients]] came to [[Terra]] approximately 300,000 years ago, took samples of _homo sapiens_ and spread them throughout [[Charted Space]]. In some cases, these humans were genetically engineered to survive on alien worlds or to serve the Ancients in some capacity. In others, they were left to evolve on their own, subtly affected by the unique environments of their various worlds. The entirety of the human species and its myriad subspecies is called [[Humaniti]]. The [[Solomani]], [[Vilani]] and [[Zhodani]] are the three human subspecies that developed jump drive technology independently, earning them [[Major Race]] status. Other human subspecies are [[Minor Race]]s.

[[Charted Space]] refers to the interstellar region that is inhabited by [[Humaniti]] and hundreds of alien races. The entire region is, in fact, only a small portion of the Sagittarian Arm of the Milky Way galaxy. Vast expanses of uncharted and only recently explored space lie beyond its borders. Charted Space is divided into distinct regions and polities. The generally accepted measurement of space is the parsec, approximately 3.26 light years in distance. Astrocartographers have divided [[Charted Space]] into regions called sectors, which are 40 parsecs long by 32 parsecs wide. Sectors are subdivided into 16 subsectors, each of which encompass an area 10 parsecs long by eight wide. The entirety of [[Charted Space]] contains 128 sectors and over 80,000 stars, many of which are orbited by inhabited worlds. The [[Imperium]] later created subdivides of its territories called domains, each of which includes four sectors, but this was a political division, not an astrographic one.

Galactic directions are sometimes referenced in this book. There are four directions on maps of Charted Space. Coreward is in the direction of the galactic core or the top of the map. Rimward is in the direction of the galactic rim or the bottom of the map. Spinward indicates the direction in which the galaxy is spinning or the left of the map. Finally, trailing indicates the direction in which the spiral arm is extended or the right of the map.

While there are hundreds of alien races, there are only six that are considered to be Major Races. These are Humaniti, Aslan, Vargr, K'kree, Hivers and Droyne. Hundreds of Minor alien races, most of which have been gifted jump technology by the Major Races over the centuries, also travel the stars but none have large interstellar empires that measure up to those of the Major Races.

Each of the [[Major Race]]s has its own dating system but this book uses that of [[Humaniti]], specifically the [[Imperial Calendar]]. The Imperium measures time in years, which consist of 365 days of 24 hours each. The first day of the year is called Holiday and the remainder of the year is divided into seven-day weeks, whose days are called Wonday, Tuday, Thirday, Forday, Fiday, Sixday and Senday. The current year is 1105, the 1,105th year of the Third Imperium. Historical records referring to events that occurred before the Imperium was founded are shown as negative numbers. For example, Cleon I, the first Emperor of the Third Imperium, was born in the year -57.
