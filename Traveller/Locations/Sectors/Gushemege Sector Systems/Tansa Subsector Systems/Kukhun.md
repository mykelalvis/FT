History & Background (Dossier)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kukhun was seeded by the Ancients with human stock around 300,000 years ago. By the time that the Vilani Naasirka bureau made first contact around -9100" they had reached TL–4. The Kukhunen or Lancians were a creative culture, but with a taste for violence and a mind of their own that did not take too kindly to the rigidity of Vilani rule. In concert with the neighboring S'mrii they were continually champing at the bit of Vilani rule. The dominant religion at the time was called Paatissa.

*   When Vilani rule was overthrown in -2219 the Kukhunen, who had now spread to several neighboring systems, found themselves presented with the no more benign rule of the Solomani. As the Second Imperium slipped into the chaos of the Long Night the [[Kukhunen]] entered into a bloody civil war. This was initially between the colonies, but was eventually fought out between factions on Kukhun itself. At the same time Kukhun slipped into an ice age as Mihev, the planet's K0V star, entered a cooling phase that has lasted to this day.

### Imperial High (Landed) Nobility

**Kukhun**, as a member world of the Third Imperium, holds the estates of three members of the Imperial Nobility, who are charged with overseeing the world.

*   It holds the estate of an Imperial knight.
*   It holds the fiefdom of an Imperial count.
*   It holds the fiefdom of an Imperial subsector duke.

### Law

Nominally [[LawLevel 7]]

Lancian courts, called _Ammeinha_, are made up of 13 person "benches", a combined judiciary and jury, similar to Solomani Courts Martial. Each district's _Ammeinha_ reflects the district demographics. The emphasis is very much on trial by one's peers.

### Military

Most Lancians do not like the idea of permanent military forces, and even less the idea of serving in them. As a result most standing forces, the _Pulehov_, are small and often composed of non-Lancians. In times of war, the combined Lancian community -- the peoples' army, the _Silkku_, is the ultimate defense of this and other Lancian worlds.

### History-Era: Long Night

**Non-canon:** The Kukhunen initially seemed oblivious to these three threats to their survival. Their salvation came from the efforts of the Lancian Movement. This movement, named for the goddess Lancia of Kukhunen mythology, believed fervently in the importance of creativity, both as a way of life and as a way of thought. By -1324 when the Civil War was at its height the Movement had gained significant numbers of followers in all the factions, including amongst the faction leaderships. It was through the efforts of the Lancian leaders that peace was brought about, and the planet began to address itself to the problems of the Long Night and the advancing ice age.

*   The Lancian Movement formed the core of the new world government. Over the next century, as Kukhun successfully dealt with the ice age threat and managed to maintain a TL–6 society, Lancian philosophy permeated every facet of Kukhunen society, and every Kukhunen's mindset. By -1200 Lancian culture dominated Kukhun.
*   Kukhun was unusual in having an active and creative existence during the Long Night. It emerged, after re-contact by Sylean traders in -143, as a vibrant and energetic world anxious to make its mark in the stars. Jump drive was rapidly re-acquired and for the next 150 years contact was re-established with "lost" Kukhunen colonies ( who were rapidly converted to Lancia ), and new worlds were settled.
