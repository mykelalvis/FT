### Sternmetal Horizons

Sternmetal competes with the somewhat more diversified Ling
Standard Products for top slot in the mining and manufacturing
sectors. The firm also undertakes some heavy engineering and
construction projects. It manufactures power generation and
transmission equipment for starship, vehicular, industrial and civil
uses. Sternmetal is also the foremost producer of food synthesis
equipment in the Imperium.

Sternmetal tends to do things on a large scale if they are worth
doing at all. 'Corp Towns' are not uncommon where Sternmetal has
brought an entire colony of workers and their families into an area
or recruited them and provided a ready–made settlement. Living
conditions are generally very good in the corp–towns, and in many
cases they have expanded beyond the original application to become
thriving cities in their own right.

Sternmetal has always been a major player in the mining and manufacturing sectors, and was one of the original heavy investors in the sector. Its power generation and food production equipment is in use on a great many worlds, with the company's research division finding innovative ways to make otherwise inedible substances palatable and nutritious. Despite aiming for a reputation as 'the colonist's friend' Sternmetal has a reputation for hard-nosed business practices and puts living conditions far below profit on its many mining installations across the sector.
