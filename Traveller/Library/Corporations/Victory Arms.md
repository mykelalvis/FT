# VICTORY ARMS LIC

Victory Arms is a small firm specialising in low–cost weaponry in the mid to fairly high tech range. Its manufacturing arm produces a range of cheap small arms that are often found equipping low– budget mercenary firms and an unfortunate number of insurgent organizations. Some world governments have placed large orders for Victory weapons but there have been difficulties in fulfilling these orders. Perhaps as a result Victory is rumored to be in financial difficulties.
