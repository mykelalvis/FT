![[TImp-Ssienjhiovla.jpg|300]]
[[Shimaraak]] is the homeworld of the Ssienjhiovla, a species of mollusc-like omnivorous sophonts, which had developed to approximately TL3 when discovered by the [[Ziru Sirka]] thousands of years ago. The Ssienjhiovla evolved from a strictly aquatic to an amphibious species at some point in their evolutionary development. [[Shimaraak]] has a remarkably old and stable yellow main sequence star, so catastrophic stellar flares are an unlikely culprit to have brought about the mutation.

> The Ssienjhiovla are shelled, mollusc-like species that are highly adapted to the conditions of their homeworld. The atmosphere is thin and low with high gravity, which resulted in the development of no avian species and enabled many unique evolutionary paths to occur. The Ssienjhiovla have smooth, moist skin on their legs that gradually becomes drier and more porous higher on the trunk. They have two squat, dextrous feet that require constant moisturization lest they become chapped and cracked, causing great discomfort. The feet have numerous suckers that enable them to firmly grip just about any surface when shoes are not worn. It is very difficult to move a Ssienjhiovla that has anchored itself with its foot suckers. Their upper bodies have four arm-like appendages, each of which ends in a malleable, six-fingered hand. Any of their digits can be made opposable to the others, giving the Ssienjhiovla heightened dexterity. They do not have a head; instead, their brain and sensory organs are located towards the centre of the trunk.

> Ssienjhiovla do not hear well by human standards. The thin atmosphere of their homeworld does not permit the easy propagation of sound but they do have exceptional senses of sight and smell. Their primary mode of communication is the excretion of various gases and pheromones from their porous upper bodies. Their olfactory senses can pick out a large array of smells simultaneously from a range of up to five kilometres. Reading a composite of emitted smells from their brethren and other natural odours gives them an almost clairvoyant sixth sense. When in visual range, the Ssienjhiovla also communicate by gesticulating with their arms and fingers to convey complex thoughts and feelings to one another. Devices similar to those used by the Hivers have been created, which enable the Ssienjhiovla to communicate audibly with humans.
>
> The Ssienjhiovla are asexual and temporarily develop male and female parts in order to reproduce. An individual Ssienjhiovla may therefore become both male and female several  times over the course of its life. They bear live and motile young who are almost immediately independent. The young grow up among the adult community and are treated like pets until they come of age, at which point they become peers.
>
> The Ssienjhiovla have a dorsal carapace that provides strong natural protection. Most Ssienjhiovla decorate their carapaces by using naturally occurring acids from Shimaraak to burn away small portions at the edges in order to produce what they believe to be an aesthetically pleasing look.
>
> Relatively few Ssienjhiovla leave their homeworld but among those who do, the most popular career choices are the Scout Service, Imperial Navy or their own planetary navy. They must wear special clothing, vacc suits and armor to help them endure the drier conditions and reduced gravity of human starships.

> ## CHARACTERISTICS
>
> Ssienjhiovla Travellers have the following modifiers applied to their characteristics: STR-2, DEX+1.
>
> ## TRAITS
>
> Ssienjhiovla Travellers have the following traits:
> **Carapace** : The Ssienjhiovla carapace gives them natural Protection +6.
> **Composite Imaging** : On worlds with Atmosphere 3â€“7, the Ssienjhiovla can use their senses to create a detailed composite image of events that occur out of visual range at a distance of up to one kilometre provided that they occur within the same environment, similar to the psionic Clairvoyance talent. This ability does not work with events that occur within a sealed environment such as a starship or behind a vault or airlock door.
> **Non-verbal Communication** : Ssienjhiovla can communicate with one another over a distance of up to five kilometres without the benefit of a radio or other device using their pheromone excretion abilities and heightened sense of smell.
