The Sylean-class battleship is one of the more common warships assigned to BatRons in the Imperial core. It is a hardy ship that punches above its weight class with its meson spinal mount and array of medium bay weaponry. Syleans are designed to serve as flagships and only have command bridges installed. Ships are named after Sylean worlds and famous Sylean citizens.
