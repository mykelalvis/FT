# THE DYNCHIA

The Dynchia (pronounced DIN-chee-ah) are a minor humanoid race originating in a region trailing of the [[Old Expanses sector]]. Most sources cite their homeworld as being [[Melantris]], in the subsector of the same name, but there is some conflicting data on the subject. Dynchia (the same word is used as both singular and plural) are about 2.2 meters in height and weigh about 100 kilograms, being slender and long-limbed. Skin tones range from pale to bronze-tan; hair colour is usually brown or black but white or silver-white is also common. Hair fibres are soft and silky, and hair runs in a bushy mane down to the small of the back. Facial hair is non-existent.

The Dynchia are generally thought to have been engineered by the [[Ancients]] from human stock, which would make them a minor human race. Experts are divided on this subject however, due to various anomalies in the genetic make-up of the Dynchia. The Dynchia have six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, however the most striking difference between the Dynchia and the rest of Humaniti is their jaw structure. Rather than possessing separate teeth, the Dynchia have a single fused structure, which also includes the bones making up what would be the upper and lower jaw on a human. The dental structure is optimized for the consumption of meat, with fang-like protrusions and a powerful, tearing bite.

Culturally, the Dynchia are very different to most other species in that they appear to have no instinct to possess territory and no instinctive protectiveness towards females. Generally speaking, a tribe or even a whole species can survive the loss of a large proportion of its males but the loss of child-bearing females is a threat to long-term survival. A protective instinct is thus useful to primitive societies and then painfully unlearned as technology evens traditional gender roles. The Dynchia have no vestiges of this instinct, suggesting that no unlearning was necessary – males and females must have operated equally throughout even primitive history.

The lack of territorial instinct manifests itself as social rather than place identity. A Dynchia will not consider themselves a citizen of a particular world but of a clan that is in turn part of a tribe. Locations have no real significance, although good resources or a favorable climate will be appreciated as much by a group of Dynchia as any other species. Dynchia have fought over resources and against outsiders in their history but a settlement that provides what a group needs will always be acceptable even if it means leaving what others might consider to be their homes.

## HISTORY

Solomani contact with the Dynchia came in the latter days of the Rule of Man, probably around –1820. Long-distance traders encountered the Dynchia, who at that time had achieved TL8 and were beginning to reach into space. Within a few years, the Dynchia had begun to make use of jump technology. The collapse of the Rule of Man ensured the Dynchia were not absorbed; instead they developed at their own pace and came to dominate a small region known as the Comitia.

Those Solomani who had settled in the area were orphaned by the collapse of their empire and found themselves living alongside an expanding interstellar power. Most adapted without trouble and within a few generations the local Solomani population were Dynchia in all but appearance.

The rise of the [[Imperium|Third Imperium]] brought human traders back to the region but the Imperial core was sufficiently distant that no attempt to annex or control the Dynchia Comitia was made. By the time reliable links were formed, around 802, the human population of the Comitia identified far more with their local culture than some distant empire, even if they had the same number of fingers and toes as its rulers. There was little sympathy for the Third Imperium among the humans of the Comitia but little animosity either.

Technological growth was slow within the Comitia, not least due to the great care taken by the Dynchia to use the resources of their worlds in a careful and complete manner without causing serious environmental damage. The maximum Tech Level reached by member worlds is 12, with many regions well below this. However, the Comitia had a large and well-developed industrial base when contacted by the Third Imperium and proved a useful trade partner. Relations have remained cordial ever since, with no reason for conflict and a modest amount of mutual gain from trade.

## SOCIETY

Dynchia society is organised as multiple nations, made up of tribes. Nations and tribes are not territorial and may live intermixed in the same area or be scattered over a number of worlds. Loyalty to tribe and nation is strong, but somehow not a cause for division. Rather than wanting another nation to be brought down, Dynchia are more likely to want to excel in some way that forces members of the rival nation to admit they are outmatched.

The same applies to family groups within a clan and clans within a nation. The result is noisy competition but is generally good-natured or at least kept within limits. Damaging other clans and tribes weakens the nation as a whole; damaging a nation weakens the race as a whole and ultimately harms everyone. Conflicts do happen but they are minor and rare. On the other hand, the Dynchia are quite willing to fight hard against outsiders or alien threats.

Dynchia cities and other settlements tend to be carefully planned and extremely well regulated, with near-total use of recycling. This not only minimises ecological damage but also creates a very efficient economy, which requires less resources for basic functions than an equivalent society elsewhere. Although expensive to create, a Dynchia colony will always be viable in the long term; growth is thus slow but sustainable.

A similar attitude exists to technology. The capabilities of any new technology are carefully explored and developed to their absolute maximum. The overall advancement of the Dynchia is a very mature TL12, with devices built in a way that makes them as efficient or effective - or both – as possible. Whereas many societies seem to rush from one breakthrough towards the next, the Dynchia seem intent on wringing every last drop of potential out of what they know before moving on to something new. As a result, although Dynchia starships and equipment may not be as advanced as those of some other species they are very well made – it may 'only' be a TL12 starship but it is the best TL12 starship anyone could make.

There are officially 12 nations of Dynchia, though humans within the Comitia are considered a 'sort-of-nation' and sometimes treated as a 13th. All nations are represented in the great council of the nations, including the human contingent and whilst debates are often quite vigorous there is a collective tendency towards the good of the Comitia as a whole which guides the words and actions of all council members. The result is usually a moderate and widely acceptable compromise to any problem, contributing to the slow but steady advancement of the Comitia as a whole.

All Dynchia go through a series of trials upon reaching adulthood. These are arduous and dangerous, with around seven percent of young adults being killed at some point. Successful completion determines the status of the individual in his clan, which will be further modified by the deeds of his life. Although Dynchia society as a whole is unwarlike, they have a warrior ethos on an individual basis. Whilst large scale conflict is extremely rare and never pressed to an extreme, skirmishes between small groups or challenges between individuals are quite common. Status within the clan is often determined by fighting prowess and the status of a clan within a tribe can also be influenced by how well its members are regarded as warriors.

Personal integrity and honor are highly prized by all Dynchia. Honor comes in part from accomplishment but only if that accomplishment is seen as worthy and fairly gained. Thus someone who climbs a difficult mountain without assistance wins honor; merely getting to the top is worthless and claiming you did it the hard way when in fact your friends dropped you off in an air/raft is a grave dishonor. Claiming honor falsely is a disgrace in Dynchia society. Stopping short of completing an action that would bring great honor for humble and selfless reasons is considered by many to be greater than actually accomplishing the deed. A Dynchia mountaineer who turns back from the summit to help a casualty might be lauded more highly than the rival who was the first to get to the top of an unconquered peak.

Ancestors are venerated and all Dynchia have the chance to become one of the great ancestors if they live a virtuous life and retain honor. Dishonor, even of a secret sort, will make it impossible for an individual to become a venerated ancestor. Dynchia therefore sometimes go to great lengths to make up for some failing – which might be imaginary or trivial to everyone else – and will occasionally be encountered trying to atone for a dishonor nobody knows about.

## GOVERNMENT AND MILITARY

The government of a Dynchia world is always a charismatic oligarchy, regardless of other characteristics of the system. It is ruled by a council comprised of the highest ranking members of the nations present, in proportions based upon the percentage of the population who are members of that nation. This can be confusing to outsiders, who may mistake a nation for world population or vice versa. The fact that members of several nations may be present on a world means that its effective and fair governance is important to multiple nations and thus the common good of the race as a whole is promoted.

The system is repeated at lower levels of government; the highest ranking members of each tribe or clan form a council to rule and guide the local population. At the highest level, the most senior member of the most senior clan in each nation is known as its prince and has a place on the council that rules the Comitia as a whole. The human 'nation' has a representative on this council who is always consulted and asked to offer advice but does not have a vote.

The military of the Dynchia answers directly to the ruling council and has no loyalty to nation, clan or tribe. It is organised along conventional lines with ground forces, space forces and a marine force capable of operating from starships. All Dynchia are potential combatants with at least some training as warriors, creating an enormous pool of available personnel from whom the few formally organised military units are recruited. Other formations are raised on a temporary basis as necessary.

The Dynchia are warriors rather than soldiers, favoring individual or small-group action in support of an overall aim rather than elaborate battle plans. Ground forces are made up for the most part of lightly equipped infantry and grav cavalry using fast and lightly armored vehicles. Hit- and-run harassment tactics are most common, which gradually morph into an encroachment and finally overwhelming assault from all sides.

Warfare against the Dynchia has been described as 'trying to fight the sea'. Sometimes an enemy force will melt away like the tide going out but more commonly a series of small waves laps up against enemy positions and falls back a little less each time until the defenders are inundated. Defensively, the situation is much the same. It is possible to exterminate a Dynchia force but getting them to surrender is virtually impossible. Their leaders will negotiate a reasonable peace treaty and honor it, however if seriously threatened the Dynchia fight to the very last.

Space forces operate in much the same way. Ships are, for the most part, small and fast with more weaponry than protection. Tactics are similar to those used in ground combat, eroding an enemy's strength and isolating installations until they can be overrun one-by-one. The space forces receive the vast majority of the military budget and enjoy a local technological superiority over most potential enemies.

## DYNCHIA TRAVELLERS

![[JTAS-01-197.jpg]]
Dynchia can be encountered almost anywhere in Charted Space, although they are most common around their home region. Their career structure is similar to that of most other spacefaring races and most careers are available within their home society. Dynchia struggle to fit into a hierarchical command structure based on different values to their own and generally do not join military or highly structured organizations outside their own society. They would be entirely at home in the Imperial Scout Service, aboard a free trader or in a loosely organised mercenary group, however joining an Imperial corporation or similar organization would mean taking orders from someone whose status is not defined by clan affiliation and performance in the trials. Some Dynchia can make the adjustment but most find the situation uncomfortable or downright incomprehensible.

Dynchia lack any real sense of gender specialization and cannot understand why some societies would define a person by their reproductive capabilities. This causes bafflement more often than friction but Dynchia can get into trouble in highly sexist societies because they genuinely cannot understand why some people are treated differently to others. They do not go around telling others to be less sexist – they cannot understand sexism and thus do not really oppose it as such – but will become genuinely confused and ask questions that may upset members of more differentiated societies.

A similar situation exists with racism. Dynchia are perfectly well aware that human members of their society are not the same as the Dynchia but see them as 'a tribe who joined us and are part of our society' and cannot understand how physical differences are important – what matters is whether you are part of the Comitia or not. Overall, the Dynchia are rather innocent about matters like racism and sexism, and just plain do not understand them.

### Careers

All standard careers are available within Dynchia society. DM-2 applies to any Traveller attempting to enlist in the Army – it is small and takes only the very best applicants. Outside the Comitia, Dynchia can join any career with a loose command structure without penalty but suffer DM-2 on enlistment, commission and promotion rolls in highly organised careers; the Army, Navy, Marines or merchant lines larger than a free trader crew.

### Characteristics

Dynchia Travellers are quite lightly built and generate STR by rolling 1D+3. Other characteristics are generated as normal with the following modifiers: DEX +1, EDU +1

### Traits

Dynchia Travellers all possess the following traits.

#### Mature Technology

A Dynchia with access to a workshop and who has the right skills can modify any device up to TL12 to make it more like the way his own people would have built it. This is a lengthy process requiring a rebuild and possibly redesign involving few of the original components and will cost 50- 150% of the item's original price. At the end of the process the item will be around 10% better in one area, which might be aesthetic or functional. A g/ bike, for example, could be made 10% faster or might gain 10% better acceleration; a weapon might gain 10% more ammunition capacity or the ability to deliver an extra point of damage. Alternatively, it might just look better than a normal item.

#### Warrior People

All adult Dynchia have passed their trials and are confident of their own abilities. They may lack confidence in those who have not been through similar ordeals and be outright contemptuous of entitled layabouts who expect everything to be just given to them. DM-1 applies to all social interactions with someone of dubious honor or who lacks proven capabilities. In addition, all Dynchia gain one level in Gun Combat or Melee before starting a career.

## Naming Dynchia

A Dynchia name follows a simple pattern: 'xx of yy, called zz,' where xx is the personal name, yy is the current place of residence and zz is an honorific name, bestowed upon completing the trials.

The tribe of the individual is noted by the ending of the personal name; thus, Astolian is a member of the Lian Tribe, Estravel is of the Avel Tribe and so on. The Twelve Tribes of the Dynchia are: Lian, Avel, Erol, Kirest, Nast, Otir, Kila, Sime, Tros, Rhes, Saro and Dera.
