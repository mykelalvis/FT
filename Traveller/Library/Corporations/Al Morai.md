# AL MORAI

One of the larger non–Megacorporations of the region, Al Morai is a shipping firm based out of [[Mora]] and is often referred to as a 'sector line' in merchant–service parlance. This simply means that it serves an area roughly a sector in size. Al Morai vessels operate in [[Deneb sector]] as well as much of the [[Spinward Marches]]. The firm also conducts exploratory trade, which is more usually the province of smaller lines. It is also one of the few shipping lines to own specialised warships. These 'route protectors' are small escort– sized ships that patrol the routes used by Al Morai and accompany some flights. Less well known is the firm's extensive network of information-gathering assets which pass along what they learn about smuggling and piracy to the [[Imperial Navy]].
