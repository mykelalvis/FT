Eleven of the Million subsector's twenty-two star systems lie within the Imperial border, most part of a central chain running out of the [[Imperium]] to coreward. At the rimward end of the chain lies [[Taproban]], which acts as a trade hub for worlds to coreward.

The astrography of Million, along with its proximity to Vargr states, made colonization and subsequent economic expansion a difficult proposition.  Communication with the Khouth subsector in [[Corridor Sector|Corridor]] requires jump-3 vessels, or a long jump-2 transit to rimward or outside Imperial space to coreward. The x-boat route running along the border from Khouth ensures that data travels quickly but goods and commercial ships tend not to enter the subsector from that direction.

Communications with [[Antra Subsector|Antra]], to spinward, are equally difficult, making [[Vargr]] worlds to coreward the best trading partners for the central worlds of Million.  Politics does not always permit this however, so the most reliable markets are found to rimward, in [[Atsah Subsector|Atsah]].  Indeed, Million is to a great extent an extension of Atsah and not a very important one at that; although Million has a subsector administration of sorts, most policy decisions are made on [[Atsah]] and there is a long history of putting Million a distant second. As a result, raw materials and low-value goods flow rimward, with industrial and luxury items imported into Million at premium prices. This has further stunted the economic growth of the region and ensured its economies remain dependent on those of Atsah.

The 61st Fleet, assigned to Million, is optimized for dealing with small-scale incursions by [[Vargr]] corsairs; if 'optimized' is the right word. The fleet is used as a dumping-ground for obsolescent vessels and 'plodder'  officers and spends most of its time on routine patrols in the systems around [[Taproban]]. Vessels are typically old, small and in need of maintenance, with spares of all kinds in short supply.

Cross-border operations are carried out by far better vessels assigned to Sector Fleet command and deployed in the subsector when needed. These ships show the flag and dash back and forth across the border to deal with crises, leaving the subsector fleet to enforce customs regulations and mount sensor watches over backwater worlds. The 61st Fleet shows up poorly in joint exercises and their Sector Fleet colleagues are not kind about it.  Real resentment is growing among the personnel of this force, although as yet it manifests only as poor morale and even poorer performance.
