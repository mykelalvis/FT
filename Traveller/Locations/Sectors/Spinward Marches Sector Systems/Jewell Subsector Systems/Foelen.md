From [[Tripwire]]
Foelen Foelen 0601 B638665–8 0601 B638665–8 Z NIZ NI The indigenous population of this ocean world are an aquatic race, resulting from the genetic manipulation of dolphins by the Ancients. The Zhodani occupied Foelen when they discovered that this species, the Chokari (literally meaning ‘water people’), had strong Psionic abilities that warranted further study. Full details can be found on page 69 (Tripwire).

This system has a planetoid belt and five planets, with Foelen occupying the third orbit.

Foelen 0601 B638665–8 Z NI The indigenous population of this ocean world are an aquatic race called the [[Chokari]] who resulted from the genetic manipulation of dolphins by the Ancients. The Chokari developed their own society and although intelligent they had no need to progress beyond TL 2.

When the [[Zhodani]] first encountered the Chokari in 189 they were thought to be nothing more than a primitive species. It was only in 852 that scientists discovered they were intelligent, and more importantly, had strong psionic abilities. The [[Zhodani]] occupied Foelen in 853 to study the Chokari further.

Although the [[Zhodani]] imposed their rule on the Chokari, it has had little effect on the running of their society. However, Chokari individuals are frequently taken to be experimented upon by the Zhodani, which causes great distress to the individual and his tribe. The Chokari are rarely injured during the experiments but the ordeal takes its toll.

The population of Foelen consists of roughly three million Chokari spread over many tribes and almost one million [[Zhodani]] who occupy nine settlements. Some tribes have successfully integrated with the [[Zhodani]] but the majority of settlements are predominently [[Zhodani]] or predominently Chokari.

# ATTITUDES

The Chokari are a peaceful people but most tribes have a strong dislike for the Zhodani. Many of these tribes make life difficult for the Zhodani, often resulting in [[Zhodani]] citizens being sent offworld for re-education. The [[Zhodani]] actually have a great respect for the Chokari and their psionic abilities but the difficulties they cause has resulted in increased hostility from the Zhodani.

Travellers do not receive a particularly warm welcome from the [[Zhodani]] who question the motives of anyone visiting here. Likewise, the Chokari are wary of offworlders but non-[[Zhodani]] have been known to earn the trust of the indigenous people.

# LAWS

All incoming and outbound travel must be registered with the port authorities and offworld travel for Chokari citizens is not permitted. Carrying personal weapons is discouraged and all other weapons are banned. Trading high technology items is also illegal.

# PLACES OF INTEREST

## Bizentia

The [[Zhodani]] capital of Foelen is a sizable city with a population of nearly one million people. It is typical of many [[Zhodani]] cities but has few facilities for travellers as Foelen is dedicated to more scientific research rather than trade. There is also a heavy military presence here to quell any potential uprising from the Chokari.

Bizentia is also one of the few [[Zhodani]] settlements where [[Chokari]] live and work with the Zhodani. The Chokari here are the Selona tribe who believe more is gained by working with the [[Zhodani]] than against them.

## Starport

The starport is situated a short distance from Bizentia and within 100km of the other [[Zhodani]] settlements.

## Kalesh

Kalesh is the largest Chokari cityand is located on the coast, like all their settlements. The buildings are made from a white marble-like substance and are expertly constructed to sleek designs. Running through the city and into the sea is a river that has channels veering off into pools and water features.

## FOELEN

Foelen is 80% covered in oceans, with little land that is particularly habitable; low-lying areas are swampy whilst most inland regions are steep and rocky. There are some regions suitable for major land-dwelling habitation but most of the population dwell in the coastal areas or the seas themselves.

Despite a very thin atmosphere, Foelen has a well-developed ecosystem, which includes a number of species not native to the planet. Some are obviously of Terran origins, while others come from areas far across Charted Space. Intelligent life is equally diverse. Around 20% of the 9 million or so inhabitants are intelligent Dolphins, whilst another 40% belong to a humanoid minor race called the Chokari. The remainder are mostly humans of Zhodani extraction.

Contact between the Zhodani Consulate and Chokari is recorded as occurring in 189. Initially, the Chokari were thought to be a primitive species, of no great interest. A few humans, of Zhodani and other origin, settled on Foelen but since the early settlements were in upland areas well away from the coasts, there was little interaction in the early years.

It was not until 852 that the Chokari were revealed to be highly intelligent, with a TL2 tribal-based society. More importantly, they were found to possess significant psionic powers. Within a year, the Zhodani Consulate had formally annexed the world and settled a few million people to formalise the claim. The main settlements are still far inland, as is the starport, and most citizens have little contact with either the Chokari or the Dolphins.

Some Chokari are taken for experimentation and, although this is typically a fairly benign process – and certainly not the lurid vivisection depicted on certain Imperial vid channels – it is still distressing for the Chokari and their tribes. The Chokari are engaged in a very passive campaign of resistance to the Zhodani, who in turn try to keep visitors from contacting them.

> [!info] Creating Dolphin Travellers
>
> Dolphins are found on many worlds. Some were apparently transplanted by the Ancients; others went with humans when they later ventured out among the stars. The Dolphins of Foelen appear to be descended from a group uplifted to full sentience by the Ancients at around the same time that the Chokari were being engineered. They are thus separated from Dolphins later uplifted by humans by several hundred thousand years of localised evolution.
>
> The Foelen Dolphins are adapted for unusually deep diving, although they can interbreed with other Dolphins and are physically very similar. They get along well with the Chokari, although the two cultures live apart. The Dolphins sometimes hire out to aquaculture concerns, assisting with fish-herding or specialist underwater tasks.
> More commonly, they live peaceful lives in the ocean, enjoying contact with other species but not requiring it. The Dolphins have a long oral tradition, telling of the deeds done by their ancestors in a complex history. Much of this material is remembered in the form of epic poetry, which enjoyed a brief surge of offworld popularity a few years ago. However, it was too convoluted and specific in focus to become a mainstream art form.

> ### Characteristics
>
> Dolphin Travellers have the following modifiers applied to their characteristics: END+1, SOC-1.
>
> ### Traits
>
> Dolphin Travellers all possess the following traits:
> **Deep Diver (300m):** Foelen Dolphins can dive deep underwater, to a depth of 300 meters without risk and can hold their breath for up to 15 minutes.
> **Echolocation (100m):** Dolphins use a highly sensitive echolocation sense to navigate their environment, effectively allowing them to ‘see’ underwater or in complete darkness to a range of 100 meters.
> **Swimmer (12m):** Dolphins are superb swimmers and can move through water at a speed of 12 meters.
>
> ### Careers
>
> All careers from the _Traveller Core Rulebook_ are suitable for Dolphins.

> [!info] Creating Chokari Travellers
> The Chokari of Foelen share a common heritage with the Dolphins of their world but their distant ancestors were subjected to a much more radical program of genetic manipulation; it is thought that this occurred after they were raised to sentience. The idea that their sentient Dolphin ancestors were subjected to such experimentation causes most Chokari to despise the Ancients.
>
> The Chokari are humanoids adapted to life underwater, although they are quite comfortable on land. They speak with a clicking sound, reminiscent of Dolphin speech, and can converse in the Dolphins’ own language. Relations between them are amicable, yet sincere-sounding insults are often intermixed with commentary on Dolphin epic poetry when the two groups meet. The conceit is that Chokari pretend they believe their Dolphin cousins are ‘unfinished prototypes’, while Dolphins say Chokari were once perfect but then became human. In reality, both groups are respectful of one another and their insults are more like ritualised banter between family members than any attempt to offend.
>
> The Chokari have psionic tendencies but typically prefer to confuse and misdirect than to harm an enemy. They are resentful of the Zhodani occupation of their world but few Chokari actively resist it. Instead they take the long view- they have lived peacefully on Foelen for nearly 300,000 years and can afford to wait until the Zhodani depart. Most Chokari are convinced that will happen sooner or later.
>
> ###Characteristics
> Chokari Travellers have the following modifiers applied to their characteristics: END+1, SOC-1. In addition, Chokari have a PSI characteristic rolled for using 2D.
>

### TYPE D BATTLE DRESS

![[BtC-5304.jpg]]
This is a combat version of the travel suit and includes all its facilities. However, it is extremely well-armored and adds waldos, the full electronics suite for battle dress found on page 30 of the _Central Supply Catalogue_ , and a sonar-based sensor system with a range of 1km that grants DM+2 to Electronics (sensors) checks.

### WALDO

![[BtC-5305.jpg]]
A waldo is a mechanical manipulation device used by Dolphins as substitute hands and arms. They are typically built into travel suits but can also be worn as a harness. At TL9, waldos are typically clumsy and weak (DM-2 to all checks involving their use) but at TL12 a surgically implanted neural control plug is used (the operation costing Cr150000), reducing the penalty in their use to DM-1 and increasing STR+2. At TL15, there is no penalty involved in their use and strength is increased by STR+4.
