Prince Amaad Dagashkugiim, Noble
**By Geir Lanesskog**

Location: Hoganas (1125 B5697AA-A) or Haapamaki (
A75A621-D) or some system in between, Vanguard Reaches
Required Skills: Assorted starship crew skills, Astrogation 2+
preferred, Electronics (remote ops) a bonus
Required Equipment: None
Reward: Twice standard crew wages plus a possible bonus of six
months' pay

Mission: Fill open crew positions on HSV FarStep for Prince Amaad's
expedition to Drenalch to search for Ancients artefacts

Summary: Prince Amaad Dagashkugiim is a great-grandson of
Golden Sovereign of Hoganas and an enthusiast for history and
archaeology. The FarStep is a 400-ton yacht equipped with a jump-drive commissioned by Amaad specifically to easily reach the Drenalch
system and to search for Ancients artefacts on the surface of the
obviously terraformed planet. The Ghenani 'native' minor human race
has never allowed outsiders to perform an archaeological study and
have permanently stalled permission for the Zhodani to do so.

Prince Amaad has managed to acquire an orbital survey conducted by
the Zhodani and is convinced that he, as a 'neutral party', can receive
permission to conduct a dig. He is also fairly certain he can dig in one
of the likely sites without permission if necessary, although he will not
state this upfront to the Travellers and certainly not to the Ghenani.

The Prince is accompanied by his bodyguard/assistant, Thursday but
he does not want to hire additional crew from Hoganas for various
reasons. Primarily, the ship at TL13 is more advanced than any
domestically produced TL10 ship, especially as it requires an Astrogator
used to more than one or maybe two parsec jumps. Also, the people
of Hoganas venerate the Golden Sovereign and his family like demi-gods, which Amaad finds tiresome and believes would likely offend
the Ghenani, since long-ago Zhodani castaways attempted to pass
themselves off as gods.

See Farstep's description for crew requirements. A single Traveller may
fill multiple positions but the crew should include at least two bridge
crew, two personnel with engineering skill – at least one of which is not
a bridge crewmember – and at least one gunner. Thursday can act as
the medic and or/second steward but the crew should include at least
one steward. Any crew positions not filled by the Travellers can be filled
by NPCs.

Once fuelled at Hoganas, FarStep will jump to the red giant system of
Drenalch. Upon emergence, Prince Amaad will begin radio negotiations
with the local authorities for permission to perform a 'ground study'
of the site identified in the Zhodani survey. As the ship approaches,
Amaad will instruct the crew to perform their own sensor examination
of the site. The ship will be granted access to land and refuel at the
starport – in reality the main airport at the capital city of Zeretosi.

Amaad makes it a priority to ensure the ship is refuelled and
reprovisioned, as refuelling from a gas giant requires a long voyage
across the star system. After landing the crew must fill out many paper
forms for customs, immigration and inspection – although nothing but a
cursory ship inspection is carried out by the TL5 inspectors who seem
more interested in a sightseeing trip aboard the luxury yacht than any
search for contraband. Once cleared for entry, Amaad is invited to a
reception at the headquarters of the Ministry of Interstellar Relations.

Depending on skills and relationships, some or all Travellers may
accompany Amaad and Thursday to the reception. Events may
influence the outcome of the negotiations. Among the other guests
are the Zhodani ambassador to Drenalch and her senior staff. After
the reception, assuming no diplomatic incident, the Ministry informs
Amaad they will act upon his request within 200 standard hours (about
eight days). In the meantime, the Prince and crew are issued tourist
visas good for travel in the inhabited portions of Drenalch. The planet's
surface gravity is 1.51G and the atmospheric density is two bars,
potentially impacting tourist activities. The ship and its launch must
remain at the starport but the air/raft has permission to travel within a
restricted range covering Drenalch's inhabited regions, which are all at
least 3,000 kilometers from the suspected Ancients site.

At the end of the period, the government makes a decision on Amaad's
application. Rather than roll for the result, the Referee may choose
to implement a result based on the actions of Amaad and crew. In all
instances, see Dig Details and Site Details for site-specific information.

REFEREE'S INFORMATION:
1–2: The petition is denied. Amaad is informed that there is an appeal
process but it may take years and is unlikely to change the outcome. Amaad
chooses to ignore the denial and proceeds with a clandestine operation.

The Ghenani discover Amaad's activities on a 1D roll of 6 per standard
day. Law enforcement response to the remote location takes another
day and begins with a single air/raft containing a driver and four
troopers equipped to TL10, armored with Cloth (+8) and armed with
ACRs (3D, Auto 3, Scope). If necessary, an airborne unit will arrive
via transport plane two days later, with a full platoon of paratroopers
equipped to TL5 with Jack armor (+1) and standard rifles, plus three
machine gunners (3D, Auto 4). Additional troops require dirigible or sea

deployment, arriving in one to two weeks but, in theory, the Ghenani
could deploy an entire infantry division and a wing of light fighter
aircraft to attack Prince Amaad. This level of deployment would be
accompanied by a formal declaration of war between Drenalch and
Hoganas and would result in an eventual alliance between Drenalch
and the Zhodani with severe implications to trade, although the Zhodani
would just protect Drenalch and claim it as a client state and not directly
attack Hoganas.

3–4: The petition is granted but requires a Ghenani team to join
the expedition to ensure cultural artefacts are not taken offworld
without further negotiation. The team includes two academics and
two security guards armed with standard rifles and revolvers. The
academics are effectively useless, unwilling to help, and untrained
on technological equipment, but the guards will help with manual
labour. The team has a bulky radio which they will use to stay in daily
communications with civilization, but no vehicle, and will be reliant on
Amaad to provide transportation.

See 1-2 above if the Ghenani determine Amaad or the Travellers are
attempting to remove Ancients artefacts.

5: The petition is granted with the stipulation that all finds are documented
and the 'findings' shared with the Drenalch government. The wording is
vague enough for Amaad to interpret the meaning as documents will be
shared, not artefacts, but that is not likely the Ghenani intent.

Amaad is likely to remove any Ancients artefacts he uncovers and the
Ghenani will be unaware unless the Travellers alert the local authorities.
Such an act by the Travellers will result in termination of employment
and forfeiture of any bonuses. Yet despite Amaad's strong displeasure,
they will not face sanction on Hoganas for such actions.

6: As 3–4 but additionally, a Zhodani cultural attaché will accompany
the Ghenani team. The Zhodani is the Intendant Chiadriepr, with PSI
10 and talents Telepathy 2 and Clairvoyance 2. Chiadriepr has an
encrypted TL13 transceiver for communications to his embassy, a Diplo
Vest (+3) for armor and a monoblade (Melee, 3D, AP 10) concealed
in a walking cane. If Amaad attempts to smuggle any finds offworld,
Chiadriepr will alert the Ghenani and his embassy.

See 1–2 above for any subsequent Ghenani reaction. Chiadriepr will
attempt to aid the Ghenani in any attempt to thwart the theft of artefacts
but not at a high risk to his life.

DIG DETAILS:
The suspected Ancients site lies 4,000 kilometers from the starport
in a canyon in the mountains facing the open ocean. If permission is
granted to Amaad, he may move FarStep to the location but the ship

must either hover on lifters near the site, land at the open area by the
beach eight kilometers away or attempt a landing in a narrow glade – a
Very Difficult (12+) Pilot check (1D minutes, DEX). A landing by the fast
launch is only a Difficult check and an air/raft landing is Routine.

Both landslides and river silt block access to what appears to be an
underground complex of chambers spanning 90 meters diameter, most
of which lies below the valley's cliffside. A surface survey – Difficult (10+) Electronics (sensors) check (1D hours, EDU), with a DM of the
scanning vehicle's sensor (FarStep could hover above and perform the
scan; the launch or air/raft could hover or land) – will pinpoint the best
location to begin digging once Effect reaches +2. If Effect reaches -6,
an erroneousness location is determined, adding two levels of difficulty
to the excavating task. The end result of a successful scan campaign
will show a complex floor plan of a single level of oval chambers and
connecting corridors totalling 2,000 square meters, with an original
ceiling of 1.5–2 meters height.

In FarStep's cargo hold, Prince Amaad has brought along three heavy
excavation drones (similar to mining drones) and eight light drones (probe drones) for detailed work and site exploration.

Excavation by heavy drone requires supervision in the form of an
Average (8+) Electronics (remote ops) check (1D hours, DEX). Two
individuals can perform checks concurrently, with fatigue DMs affecting
those who continue for more than eight hours per 24. Any exceptional
failure results in damage to the excavators. A total Effect of 20 is required
to successfully enter the complex. See Site Details for further events.

The location of the site is subject to occasional ocean storms
accompanied by heavy rainfall. The dense atmosphere and heavy
gravity can make storms especially hazardous. Once per day, make a 2D
check for a weather event. On 8+ winds and clouds pick up, providing a
DM-2 to both sensor and excavation – but not site exploration or internal
excavation – tasks and apply a DM+2 to the next weather check.

On 11+ a storm rolls in, bringing high winds and rain. Sensor and
excavation tasks must stop. Any hovering vehicles will require a pilot,
autopilot or virtual crew to actively keep the vehicle steady, an hourly Pilot
or Flyer check – Routine for the starship, Average for the launch or Difficult
for the air/raft. Failure indicates that the vehicle cannot maintain position.
The pilot (or autopilot) must either attempt a landing at DM-2 or make
another check at the same difficulty level to clear the canyon and fly above
the storm. A second failure will require an emergency landing attempt
somewhere nearby, a check which, if failed, will result in a crash landing.

On a 13+ the storm is severe, making all noted tasks one degree more
difficult. A severe storm may cause a landslide (9+ on 2D) or flash flood (10+ on 2D) or both – roll separately. A severe storm will cause damage
to excavating equipment left unsecured (9+ on 2D: similar damage
to an Exceptional Failure) and undo 2D worth of Effect progress. A
landslide or flash flood will reset the excavation progress to zero and
add 2D to the total Effect required to complete the task.

SITE DETAILS: ROLL 1D
1: The site is mostly collapsed. Only the recon drones can penetrate
the crushed tunnels and chambers and only half (1,000 square meters)
is accessible at all. Light drones can penetrate 1D square meters per
hour autonomously or 1D + Average (8+) Electronics (remote ops)
check (DEX) if operated remotely. Only two may proceed initially but
after 20 square meters are cleared, the other six may join.

For every 10 full square meters of progress roll 1D. On a 1 the drone
makes a Find – see the Find Details table – on a 6, the drone is stuck
and will require a Difficult (10+) Electronics (remote ops) check (1D
hour, DEX) to extract, recover and repair, with cumulative failure Effects
of 6 resulting in a permanently disabled drone.

Find Details

```
2D Result
2 The device is intact and will discharge energy. This will disable
a drone and cause 2D hits of damage that can be repaired if
the drone can be recovered. If a human recovers the device it
will cause 2D damage to a random attribute (STR, DEX, END,
INT, EDU, PSI), recoverable at one point per hour (EDU loss
equals temporary memory loss). The item will then become
inert as in result 9–11.
3–8 Fragment of an artefact: Unknown piece of an unknown
object, made of unusual alloys or ceramics. These are worth
1D x Cr50000 as a curiosity if providence or authentication is
provided. A 10th if sold without documentation.
9–11 Intact but inert object: Unknown artefact of value as a display
item or curiosity. These are worth 1D x 200000 with providence
or documentation but only a 20th without. There are many fake
Ancients artefacts.
12 Possibly functional object: Unknown object with faint energy
signature. These could be anything from the equivalent of an
Ancients penlight to a psionic tricorder to a disintegrator. The
Referee should determine its actual function and the level of
effort required to understand the device, keeping in mind the
potential ramifications to any ongoing campaign or regional
balance of power. The value of such devices varies but would
start at MCr1.
```

2: The site is partially collapsed. Light drones must penetrate as
detailed in Site Details #1 for the first 100 square meters of progress
and then can explore the next 1,500 square meters at a rate of 10
square meters per hour. The final 400 square meters are utterly
crushed and inaccessible.

For every 10 full square meters of progress roll 1D. On a 1 the drone
makes a Find – see the Find Details table – on a 6, the drone is stuck
and will require a Difficult (10+) Electronics (remote ops) check (1D
hour, DEX) to extract, recover and repair, with cumulative failure Effects
of 6 resulting in a permanently disabled drone.

3: The site could be partially explored by humans if interior debris is
cleared. Light drones must penetrate the first 100 square meters to shore
up an entrance. Humans can then explore up to 1,200 square meters at
20 square meters per hour. The final 700 square meters are inaccessible.

Drones and humans make a 1D roll every 10 full square meters
of progress and make a Find on a 1 – see the Find Details table –
but humans ignore a result of 6 and drones only have a chance of
becoming stuck during the excavation of the first 100 meters.

4: As in 3 but after 1,000 cubic meters have been explored, make an
extra 2D roll for every 10 square meters explored. On a 2 or a 12 to this
roll, the drone or character has triggered a teleported pad. A drone will
become inaccessible and seem to have just vanished or disintegrated.

A Traveller who initially encounters this effect or who follows a drone
will realise they have been teleported to another location, possibly deep
within the planet, as communication appears impossible. Arriving at an
arch in the middle of a 20-meter-wide chamber, the Traveller can return
to their original location by stepping back through the arch. The drone is
not smart enough to discover this and will pause, waiting for instruction
two meters beyond the arch.

This new complex is similar in size to the original but had been
evacuated in a more orderly fashion. Only check for an artefact for
every 50 of 2,000 square meters that can be explored. There is no
need to check for a second teleport event.

5: As in 3 but the entire site was cleared once long ago. There is only
one artefact. Make one 2D Find Details roll. Optionally, trigger the
teleport pad noted above at a random interval on a random character or
drone. The subsequent chamber allows one more 2D Find Details roll.

6: As in 1 but only 500 square meters are accessible using no more
than two drones simultaneously to excavate and explore. Everything
else is crushed.

Finally:
Prince Amaad's criteria for success is the recovery of a functional or
at least intact Ancients artefact for him to display in his Cabinet of
Curiosities on Hoganas. A research paper or at least a documentary-grade recording of the expedition and the Ancients site itself would be
considered a marginal success. In either of these cases, Prince Amaad
will pay the Travellers a bonus of six months double salaries and might
ask some or all to remain on as his crew. If things go badly, but the ship
and crew manage to return to Hoganas, even if Amaad or the Travellers
start a war in the process, they will still get paid but Amaad will likely
dismiss them from service. Depending on circumstances, he may want
to make a second attempt to visit the site, likely surreptitiously, and
depending on events, may employ the Travellers for the attempt.

If Thursday dies during the expedition, Prince Amaad will become
despondent and abandon any future attempts to acquire Ancients
artefacts. He will likely sell FarStep, perhaps for as little as half
its value. If Prince Amaad dies during the expedition the Golden
Sovereign will be very displeased. The Travellers may need to find a
quick way off Hoganas or consider the risks of stealing FarStep for
themselves rather than returning.

Prince Amaad Dagashkugiim
is a great-grandson of Golden
Sovereign of Hoganas and
thought to be fourth in line
to the throne. He may be
50 but he looks to be in his
mid-30s, a slight man with
bronze skin and a bald
head who maintains a
pose of command and
the restrained dignity of
someone who has no
doubt of his authority but
sees no reason to flaunt
it. He hates the fawning
worship of the people of
Hoganas and prefers to
be treated like a human,
not a god, but not as an
equal either. He expects
others to differ to him but if
approached politely, he is
open to suggestions, stating,
'How can you ever learn if
you are never wrong?'.

Amaad has spent most of his life studying one topic or another
and amassed by his own admission 'An incredible amount of
mostly useless knowledge'. He is not by any means a genius and
does not do well thinking outside the box when careful plans go
awry. He will become fixated on a task and will stubbornly pursue
it beyond reasonable limits. Only Thursday has been able to talk
him into abandoning something he has fixated upon.

Prince Amaad's current obsession is the purported Ancients
site on Drenalch. The FarStep was commissioned with jump-4 engines and Thrust 2 specifically to make the journey to
Drenalch easier and the ship's completion is the cumulation
of three years research and planning. He will undertake the
expedition regardless of whether he receives permission from
the Ghenani – although of course he would prefer to receive
permission. He is also determined to bring back at least
one intact, preferably functional, artefact, although he will
compromise on allowing some or even the bulk of his finds to
remain on Drenalch, however he will lie, cheat and steal – but
not kill – to get his one artefact back to Hoganas.

Amaad calls Alena Drakovi
Thursday because 'I put
her before any girl Friday'.
She does not look imposing,
being barely 160 centimeters
and 45 kilograms, but
she is primarily Amaad's
bodyguard. Thursday's
normal appearance is
as a mild-mannered
administrative assistant
or nurse, non-threatening
and attractive enough
to plausibly be part of a
Prince's inner circle, yet
no great beauty.

Thursday has been in Prince Amaad's employ since she was

18. Her family has served the Golden Sovereigns and their
families for centuries. She nearly always carries her monoblade
and medikit, the former disguised as a necklace that when
detached grows rigid and sprouts a monowire blade. Often,
she will carry her concealed body pistol but only in extreme
situations will she suit up in armor and carry her gauss rifle.

Thursday and Amaad maintain constant communication via
neural link. It will appear as if she knows what he is thinking
and, after 16 years, she actually often does. Despite what
some might whisper, she does not have a physical relationship
with the prince and she never has – both of their upbringings
make the idea unthinkable. However, their years together have
developed a deep bond between them, despite the fact that
neither would admit it. She will unhesitatingly sacrifice her life
for him but he would also probably return the favor without
even consciously realising what he was doing.

FARSTEP LUXURY YACHT


Custom built for Prince Amaad of Hoganas at Portmanteau Shipping
Services' shipyard on Haapamaki, the FarStep is a luxury yacht
designed for jump-4 operations. The ship's sculpted hull is streamlined,
with large windows for the bridge and passenger staterooms. A luxury
owner's suite, guest suite and staterooms surround the lounge area.
The medical bay is equipped with imported Imperial and Consulate
equipment including a top-of-the-line autodoc and an adjacent low berth
ward designed to keep passengers and crew in the best of health.

The FarStep's internal furnishings are worthy of a descendant of
the Golden Sovereign. Besides the overt use of gold fixtures and
trim, the walls and flooring are panelled with hardwoods from Boreal
and Delphye. Many furnishings and appliances appear golden but
are manufactured from smart materials and conform to passenger's
specifications at verbal command. Outside the passenger area,
FarStep is a warren of corridors weaving through tight engineering
spaces. While the crew accommodations are more spartan, they are
still first-rate by conventional standards, although the white and blue
colour scheme of the crew areas and engineering spaces are a clear
contrast to the passenger areas.

The ship is self-sufficient for most operations but the staff includes
two steward positions. One of the standard passenger staterooms is
occupied by Prince Amaad's assistant, who can fill the medic and or/
steward slot in addition to her other duties.

FAST LAUNCH


The Fast Launch is a small craft designed as a quick runabout and
intersystem transfer ship. Manufactured by the yards of Portmanteau
Shipping Services with a flattened cylinder cross-section for easy
stowage on smaller vessels, the Fast Launch is a common ship in
Diadem Main systems, used for rapid package delivery, customs
inspection and even as a versatile defence craft able to stand up to
light fighters.

Variants are common, including a cargo model with 11.1 tons
capacity, a fuel shuttle with 10 tons capacity, transports capable of
holding up to 44 passengers, troop carriers holding up to 16 fully-equipped troops and boarding vessels with forced linkage apparatus
and breaching tubes.

The Shimmerlight luxury sealed air/raft is a streamlined and vacuum-protected small grav vehicle designed to transport up to four people
and 500 kilograms of cargo in relative style and security. The hull's
multichromatic camouflage coating is most often configured for high-visibility ostentatious display but it allows for infrared masking and
can act as active camouflage if the owner desires. Armor marketed
as meteorite protection is also proof against small arms fire and
gravchute ejection seats can escape from more than just mechanical
difficulties. Agile and able to operate autonomously with a high degree
of precision, the Shimmerlight is proof that a protected vehicle does
not need to look like one.

Code Duello 'Fallisepi' 882
By Andy Sykes

Duelling in the Imperium is discouraged by the Emperor Strephon, although
this makes it no less popular amongst some nobles. The last formal Imperial
Code for Duelling was written in 882 by Count Georgo Fallisepi. The Code
Duello regulates duelling, first to ensure non-violent means of reaching
settlement are exhausted and second to enforce strict rules upon duels.

It is not illegal for nobles in the Imperium to duel and the Fallisepi Code
Duello only applies to Imperial nobility. Individual worlds may have their
own codes or may have banned duelling altogether.

Duelling is used by nobles to settle a dispute or insult wherein the
affronted person will issue a challenge; this can be conducted through
an intermediary and does not have to be in person. The challenged
may issue a formal apology or accept the duel. If the challenge is
declined the offending party must succeed at an Average (8+) Diplomat
check. If failed, they lose SOC-1.

Both parties must be of noble blood and have SOC 10+. Non-nobles
and those not of the Imperium also qualify, so long as their SOC is
10+. Former individuals who were of officer rank in the Imperial Navy,
Marines or Army are also classed as nobles under the code.

Any currently serving member of the Imperial Navy, Marines or Army is
banned from duelling by the Imperial Code of Military Justice. If issued
a challenge, they may reply with, 'I regret to state that my rank forbids
me from engaging in such actions'. It has been known for duels to be
postponed for years, until they leave the service.

A noble may not challenge a non-noble and vice versa. Duelling is
not permitted between the two. Any confrontation carried out would
be illegal and, even if the code is followed, all participants would be
open to prosecution.

Duels conducted under the code are generally ignored by law
enforcement unless death or serious injury entails. Even then it would
be classed as a lawful death or wounding, provided the code was
followed correctly. If any conditions of the code were not met or were
flaunted, these crimes may be prosecuted as normal.

Non-nobles do not have a formal code or right for duelling, although
confrontations do take place with varying codes of practice and
parameters. Some underground networks even use the Code Duello,
although any death or injury is treated as a normal crime if brought
to the attention of law enforcement. Such duels may have any set of
conditions agreed upon by the participants, limited only by imagination.

The Code
This is an abbreviated version of the code, reduced to a legible state for
those less inclined to legal documents.

PERSONNEL


Each participant must have a second to ensure fair play and traditionally
prevent the ambushing of participants. Seconds should be noble, although
this may be waived. A doctor must also be provided for each duellist. The
code also requires two witnesses who do not have affiliation to either party,
expected to be unbiased in comment or decision. If these minimums are not
met, the code is considered unfulfilled. If refreshments are to be provided a
steward from each party may also be present. Spectators are allowed but
they should not speak to the formal personnel before or during the duel.

Decorum and polite behaviour are expected throughout and a formal
dress code is common. Verbally enthusiastic encouragement from the
seconds, once the duel has commenced, is acceptable. A silent duel
may have been agreed upon, wherein all parties are to remain silent
unless forced to intercede by foul play. Any second breaking this will
lose SOC-1 and may be challenged to a duel by the opposing second.

LOCATION


The location, the 'Field of Honor', is traditionally declared by the
challenger on receiving acceptance of the challenge. This will have to
be a place where the duel can be conducted without interference and
not break local laws. Common places include estates, highport hotel
conference rooms and starships. It is not unheard of for duels to take
place in vacuum and on asteroids.

The location must have terrain that does not offer undue advantage to
either party, which will be confirmed by the seconds.

WEAPONS


The weapons are chosen by the challenged party. The code allows for
either melee or pistol weaponry to be called for. The most formal and
traditional weapons are blades, although any form of melee weaponry
may be utilised, including fists. If the two parties have different natural
weapons this option is forbidden.

Pistol weapons must be single shot. Pistols capable of firing more than
one round may be used but must be either loaded with only one round
or have only enough energy for one discharge. The weapons must be
identical and cased pairs are made specifically for duelling.

Sighting aids and accessories are seen as dishonorable but are not
directly forbidden providing that all combatants are equally equipped.
All weapons, ammunition and accessories are inspected before being
issued by the seconds, witnesses and the duellists themselves.

Seconds are traditionally allowed to carry a melee weapon, although
a stunstick or stunner is more acceptable. Doctors may also carry
the same weapons, only to be used in self-defence or to restrain
combatants if injury occurs. Spectators and witnesses should not be
armed and no other armed person should be within 300 meters of the
Field of Honor.

PERSONAL AUGMENTATION


The code does not address physical differences between individuals
except for natural weaponry. Likewise, the only restriction on personal
augmentation is that inbuilt weaponry should not be used during the
duel, unless that is the agreed armament, and each party is armed the
same. Using a combat arm to wield the agreed upon melee weapon
is allowed. Using a combat arm in a natural weapons duel is not
permitted, unless both combatants have such.

ARMOR


Combatants are to fight in shirtsleeves. If the duel takes place in an
environment that requires protection, such as a vacc suit, then these
forms of protection must be identical. Some duels may be conducted in
identical armor. Shields may also be used, provided both opponents
agree to their use.

TYPES OF DUELS


There are three types of duels: melee, pistol and combination (using
both melee weapons and pistols).

PROCEDURE


Once the challenge has been issued and accepted, all communication
should be through the seconds. The parties should meet at the agreed
place; all may inspect the ground and then the seconds will start
proceedings by reiterating the reason for the challenge, along with
the response. A debate will then take place between the seconds,
conducted using opposed Diplomat checks. If the result of this debate
is a tie, then both parties are considered to have honorably conducted
themselves; neither is at fault and there is no need for a duel.

If the results are inequal in any way the duel will take place. The
weapons are checked and issued, and distances agreed upon, marked
and set. The doctors simultaneously check each opponent and may
void the duel if one is found to be injured, ill or using drugs. A blood test
is permitted to determine the presence of drugs. The opponents then
take up position.

THE CONDITION


This is the parameter at which the duel can be closed with honor. The
winner has proved their point and the loser their reputation and courage.

Once the condition agreed upon is met, attacks should stop. A duellist
that attacks after their opponent has had first blood inflicted or becomes
unconscious, loses the duel and SOC-1. Seconds should also intercede
immediately, reasonable force being allowed to prevent further attacks,
preferably with stun weapons if necessary. Seconds may only interfere
when necessary and a loss of SOC-1 will be inflicted if they intervene at
any other time.

If both duellists are uninjured at the end of a pistol duel and all
ammunition has been fired, the matter is considered settled and closed.

```
CONDITIONS


First Blood: The first to inflict damage on their opponent is
considered the winner
Unconsciousness: A duellist becoming unconscious has lost.
Death: Death is not a condition; it may occur during the duel but
is not a set condition under the code.
Submission: Any party may concede at any time, although they
will lose the duel. They are expected to apologise; if they do not,
they are considered as without honor, losing SOC-1.
```

DOCTORS DECISION


A doctor may declare either duellist unfit to continue, at any time, and
may use a stun weapon to prevent further duelling. If this is accepted,
honor is considered fulfilled although the duellist considered unfit
has lost. The duellist being asked to retire may ask for a new duel, the
current duel being considered inconclusive. Many doctors have felt
obliged to end a duel to prevent bloodshed only to find the duellists will
fight again. Intervention in this way has become a last resort for most.

MELEE AND COMBINATION DUELS


All duels start on a signal, agreed upon beforehand, and may be
audible, visible or a combination.

Melee and combination duels are to take place in a 20-meter square
area, although this may be reduced to a 10-meter square on agreement.

A DEX or INT check is made by both duellists, the Effect of which
becomes the Initiative for the duel.

Melee duels start with the duellists opposite each other at corners
of the agreed area. Duellists conduct combat normally; dodging and
parrying are permitted. Grappling is generally not permissible and in
any attempt to do so the offending party will automatically lose the duel
and SOC-1. Seconds should intervene. It may be previously agreed
that grappling is allowed and a melee duel may be conducted in which
grappling is the only allowed attack form.

Combination duels start with opponents across from each other and
on the signal each may fire. The melee weapon may not be used until
the pistol has been fired. If the condition is still unmet, then both may
engage in melee according to the rules for a melee duel. Dodging,
parrying and diving for cover are all allowed in a combination duel.

PISTOL DUELS


Discharging your pistol deliberately away from your opponent is
discouraged, as it can be construed as showing contempt. If this
happens, the firer must make a Difficult (10+) Diplomat check. If failed,
they lose SOC-1. If they succeed, they are seen as courageous and
merciful and, with Effect 4+, also gain SOC+1.

Pistol duels may be conducted at any distance from 10 meters to
100 meters. Each combatant should agree to the distance before
the duel begins.

Walk Duel
Duellists in a walk duel start back-to-back. Upon hearing or seeing the
signal they must walk 10 meters forward to turn and fire. Once they
have halted, they must remain in place. Diving for cover and dodging
are not permitted, and if either of these are done the combatant will
lose the duel and SOC-1.

Distance
The duellists stand at a set distance and may fire once the signal
is given. After they have fired, they must stand still. Diving for cover
and dodging are not permitted, and if either of these are done the
combatant will lose the duel and SOC-1.

Multiple Shots
There is a variation wherein each participant is provided with an extra
one or two rounds of ammunition. They may reload and fire again if
the condition has not been met. Anything above three rounds in total is
seen as barbaric.

Aasamlaga: A Reserve Like No Other
By Tim Heiderich

'Take only holovids, leave no footprints. Violators will be exiled.'

Annexed by the Third Imperium in 110 in the Ot Zell subsector of
Lishun, the history of Aasamlaga (B7668CC-8) goes back another
5,000 years. It is not only one of the oldest settled worlds in the
Imperium but one of the most stunning. This pristine garden world
is prized for its natural and historical wonders. Its inhabitants have
protected it for millennia and are dedicated to preserving this unspoiled
world for future generations.

Despite its wondrous beauty, Travellers are cautioned against visiting
this majestic nature reserve as its strict environmental protections
classify it as an Amber Zone.

UWP:

B7668CC-8

History
Aasamlaga has been witness to the rise and fall of empires. Its history
reaches back to the expansionism of Pax Vilanica, when the system
was just a frontier. In that time, rich trade with distant cultures and
alien species across Lishun drew countless civilizations to Aasamlaga,
resulting in a unique and complex melding of cultures and biology.

A more hospitable homeworld than Vland, Vilani settlers protected
this world as it sheltered them, and developed an environmentally
conscious society, but the interstellar wars and decline of the First
Imperium saw the world's history and biosphere decimated over 200
years of conflict. Many subcultures and endemic creatures were lost.
Fear of losing their home hardened the inhabitants against outsiders,
whom they saw as hostile and reckless despoilers.

During the Rule of Man, trade and prosperity returned to the sector but
its collapse again left Aasamlaga alone and facing a cold and hostile
cosmos. The inhabitants weathered the Long Night huddled on their
garden home as trade and contact slowly declined, wondering whether
they might be the last of their people with a world to sustain them.

Two thousand years went by until Solomani colonists brought Aasamlaga
into the Third Imperium during the Antarean Pacification Campaign. The
values of this stable and persistent society were adopted by the colonists

- although not without some changes in perspective.

Recognising the importance of the planet's legacy, Solomani attitudes
turned the culture from harmony with nature to one of strict ecological
preservation. Culture is a mix of the environmental idealism of the
original Vilani settlers and the protectionism of the Solomani colonists,
leaving this wonder of the Third Imperium in the care of a phalanx of
militant conservationists.

Society
The planet is a pristine resort, ecological utopia and wildlife sanctuary,
where visitors are welcomed upon arrival with an environmental impact
demerit. It is looked after by a dedicated population of naturalists,
stewards, citizens and colonists, who collectively refer to themselves as
Docents – the caretakers of this enchanting environment. There is no
shortage of scenic beauty across the planet but experienced Travellers
take care to avoid this destination because of harsh penalties for even
the smallest transgression against nature. Aasamlaga culture keeps
the planet cared for through strict environmental regulation, aided by
a planetary surveillance network. For every person performing a job,
there are several more supervising them.

The Docents of Aasamlaga believe the planet's history and biodiversity
to be of the utmost importance and their two motivations are to share
these wonders with visitors and protect those wonders at all costs.
They take a particularly hard-lined attitude toward environmental
conservation and are suspicious of Travellers even when trying to make
them feel welcome.

TRADE


There is no industry on Aasamlaga. Its primary economic force is
ecotourism and its culture is overwhelmingly genteel and cheerful.
Residents live on the finest planet in the Imperium and are happy to
share that information.

The system's agricultural needs are met by the neighboring system
of Askisa (C654576-6), which was found more pragmatic to develop,
to the benefit of keeping Aasamlaga's natural wonders intact. It is
also Aasamlaga's garbage dump. The planet's higher technological
needs, such as computers and antigrav vehicles, are met by Gaamkhi (A587449-D), which also provides defence via an Imperial naval base.

TOURISM


There is a waiting list for sightseeing tours. The planet is home to a
bewildering variety of terrestrial, coastal and aquatic ecosystems, from
dense cavernous jungles and shores of walking mangroves to snow-capped crystal mountains. Its equator is an archipelago of innumerable
islands, each a unique ecosystem, and of arctic tide pools heated by
geothermal vents. Its tundra gives way to vast waterfalls springing from
ancient jagged monoliths.

Moving inland, thick forests and wide, colourful grassland spread
across terrain dotted with natural pillars of rare metals raised by
geological forces. Its sights are as splendid as any in the Imperium.

Air/rafts are the normal mode of travel, as wheeled and legged vehicles
have been heavily curtailed for their damage to the ecosystem. Visitors
will be presented with a bill for their carbon footprint upon departure.

A RESEARCHER'S PARADISE
The planet has, in its long and storied history, been home to many
exotic species, although some may now number only a few individuals.
Some 90% of species here are unique to this world. There are
creatures whose lives are ephemeral, some are relics that have lived
for thousands of years. Notable among the wildlife is a hive of an
estimated 60,000 Droyne, who have lived in isolation for centuries.
There exist scattered reservations of Chirpers across temperate lands
and a menagerie of rare and beautiful wildlife found nowhere else.

Historians and archaeologists will find much to learn exploring Vilani
heritage sites. There are living settlements populated by Vilani, which
date back to the First Imperium. Other settlements, whether abandoned
or destroyed in the Interstellar Wars, may still yield secrets or forgotten
lore, even priceless artifacts or artwork. Vargr claim legendary history,
going back to -18,000, but there are no remains to support this. Still,
Vargr anthropologists are eager to study this planet for evidence of
prehistoric settlements.

There are rumors of ruins left by the Ancients, of pyramids still
intact after hundreds of millennia, but expeditions searching for these
cultural sites are expressly forbidden to outsiders. The thousands of
kilometers of unmapped land conceals still more untold historical and
cultural discoveries.

Sophontological, archaeological and biological research here is highly
selective; for those qualified or cunning enough, the discovery of
unprecedented cultural and natural treasures awaits.

INVASIVE PESTS


The cost of keeping Aasalmaga pristine is constant vigilance against
invasive species and poachers. Despite harsh penalties, lifeforms taken
from Aasalmaga, wildflowers and apex predators alike, fetch a high
price on the black market.

Even with the strictest of environmental controls, ship-bound pests
regularly arrive planetside and can thrive in the lush environment before
being discovered, so there is always a need to cull invasive species
and repair habitats for native creatures.

HABITATION


Modern dwellings on Aasamlaga are rustic bungalows designed for
little impact on the environment, open and spartan for minimal waste
and disruption to the surroundings. Some blend in so well with their
surroundings as to be indistinguishable from only a few meters away.

Dwellings are grouped into small encampments with trails following
existing wildlife paths.

Government
Aasamlaga is overlooked by a charismatic oligarchy of Docents who
place themselves as the tireless defenders of the planet's environment
and all its creatures. Alas, centuries of insular culture have engendered
an attitude of unflappable superiority. Visitors are treated to a kind of
cheerful condescension from the locals, who tend to have a low opinion
of outsiders. They place life on their homeworld above any offworld
dregs, who they view as more or less disposable.

They view offworlders with disdain for being unable to live in harmony
with their environment, as they do, but Docents will work with outsiders
to perform unsavory tasks. Although extremely hospitable, this only
makes their attitude to offworlders all the more cloying.

LAW LEVEL AND FINES


Reflecting the world's exceptionally high Law Level, visitors can
expect their movements and everything they say will be recorded,
and are advised before stepping foot onto the planet that any actions
taken against the well-being of the local wildlife will be strictly
reprimanded, with fines for unintentional damage, fines or expulsion
for vandalism and banishment for theft or intent to harm native
creatures. Aasamlaga is happy for visitors to enjoy nature but is
exceedingly strict about its protection.

MAJOR THREATS


Although not often deployed, the armed security staff are equipped
with stunners and laser pistols for subduing hostile threats. Their cloth
armor is recognizable by its darkened earth-tone camouflage and is
100% biodegradable.

The Caretakr AI
A helpful planetwide customer service system, The Caretakr is a
panopticon designed to cater to the needs of tourists while preserving
the planet's fragile ecosystem. It tracks threats to native wildlife and
directs Docents in their daily activity.

Its global surveillance network has audio/visual bugs strategically
placed across the planet, in the wilderness, habitats and all dwellings,
making it practically inescapable. It is able to track the positions of
anyone wearing a visitor's badge and can passively eavesdrop on all
audio in order to answer questions, provide information, guide tours
and issue fines.

AdventureAdventure

Rat Patrol
By Tim Heiderich

As a perk from their last job, the Travellers receive highly sought
after one-week visitor passes to Aasamlaga (B7668CC-8) in the Ot
Zell subsector of Lishun. The planet is an ancient garden world deep
in the Imperium, with an exceptionally restrictive Law Level. What
should be a week of relaxation and adventure quickly turns into a
conflict with exotic wildlife.

History of Aasamlaga
Aasamlaga's history predates the Third Imperium, the wildlife of the
planet outliving the Rule of Man and surviving the Long Night. As such,
its inhabitants have become especially vigilant in conserving their
culture and the ecosystem of their world. The planet's natural features
are a wonder of the Imperium, containing entire ecosystems found
nowhere else within Charted Space. It is both spectacular and fragile,
protected by a small population of Docents who ensure the planet's
biodiversity remains healthy and pristine at all costs.

The prize of the downport's nature preserve is an apex predator called
a quetzl, a rare and beautiful serpentine animal that was hunted almost
to extinction. The preserve is exhibiting a mated pair of quetzli, the first
of a breeding program to later be introduced back into the wild. The
Travellers' visitor passes include a free ticket to the exhibition.

Referee's Information
Any attempts to dock at the downport of Aasamlaga require a Difficult (10+) Pilot check to avoid the 'grounds restoration' fee. Whenever a
check is failed under the observation of the planetary AI, a Docent,
or groundskeeper drone, a Cr100 x Effect fine will be enforced. The
stewards of the planet are fastidious, often maddeningly so.

Every population center on Aasamlaga is overseen by a helpful
planetary AI, which dispenses tourist advice and issues fines. Visitors
are issued an audio-only commdot to speak with the automated
caretaker, which doubles as a surveillance bug. Only the remote parts
of the planet are outside the AI's watch, instead patrolled by unarmed
groundskeeper surveillance drones.

THE SITUATION


The quetzl tour begins with a shameful display of historic goods made
from the endangered animal. Situated in highly protective cases are
jewellery and other finery made from the animal's scales, psi-enhancing

drugs from its glands and ornamental weapons crafted from its tail
barb. These were originally intended for nobles of old and now stand
testament to the inherent disregard for life.

At the enclosure, the quetzli are indeed stunning to behold. It is a bird-like reptile of over five meters in length, covered in feathery, iridescent
scales. For the wellbeing of the animal the enclosure is unobtrusive,
except for a bright red line in the earth three meters outside its
perimeter. The larger quetzl seems to ignore most of the group, simply
levelling a beady-eyed gaze upon each of the visitors.

All Travellers near the enclosure should perform an Average (8+)
Recon check. The non-psionic Traveller with the lowest Effect finds
themselves drawn to the creatures within the enclosure. The quetzl
turns its hypnotic gaze towards them, seemingly inviting them to
come towards it, well beyond the marked safety line. Unable to resist
the compelling urge, the Traveller starts to walk towards the quetzl,
outstretching a hand slightly as if to pet it.

It takes a minute or so for the tour guide to notice and another few
before the hypnotised Traveller stumbles their way to within the quetzl's
striking range. Any Traveller who notices their companions distracted
state should promptly retrieve them from the exhibit. A Very Difficult (12+) Recon check allows Travellers to see the Docents speaking into
earpieces, calling for preserve security staff to apprehend the group.

DOCENT MORAN


When the tour concludes, the Travellers are held in a secure area of the
downport, little more than a small room with an assortment of seating
pushed against the walls. After a short while a stocky looking woman
enters, introducing herself as Docent Moran. Regularly dealing with
offworlders, she is professional if a little condescending. She is upset
by the potential damage the visitors could have caused to the rare,
invaluable creature in her care and is more concerned about the animal's
wellbeing than someone almost having been eaten. It is clear she blames
the Travellers carelessness, rather than the beast's psionic abilities.

Noting the demeanour of her guests, she takes the group for the sort of
unscrupulous offworlders who would engage in 'distasteful' mercenary
business. The Travellers are, in her words, perfect for performing
community service and repaying their debt.

Docent Moran points out the care that goes into maintaining such a
pristine environment and regrets that filthy Travellers from other systems
still manage to bring in invasive species. A groundskeeper drone spotted
an infestation of augers in their delicate equatorial mangroves a few
days ago. They are reported to have made homes in the root systems of
riverbank trees, which cause extensive damage to the native mangroves.

She requests the Travellers exterminate the auger colonies in order to
save the mangrove forests, giving a stern warning against damaging
the surrounding biosphere. Damage will be reported by groundskeeper
drones during their sweep and will automatically enforce fines to be
deducted before the Travellers leave the planet.

Moran is decidedly less interested in the monetary aspect of the
mission and a successful Average (8+) Broker or Persuade check
pries a fee of Cr6000 for the extermination services. If Travellers wish
to receive greater payment, a successful Very Difficult (12+) Broker or
Persuade check will have her reluctantly agree on Cr8000. If this check
is failed, she will refuse to pay more than Cr5000.

OUTFITTING AND TRANSPORT


The Travellers are loaned one of the preserve's enclosed touring air/rafts
for transport to and from the site. Security arms them with stunners and
environmentally friendly air rifles, which fire a hardened dart of organic
material. This is to comply with the planetary ban on slug throwers, due
to the toxicity posed by heavy metals, and also prevents Travellers from
harming anything other than a small animal. Daggers and blunt weapons,
cloth armor and vacc suits are permitted for this mission.

THE EQUATORIAL MANGROVES


Two hours south of the downport by air/raft, the humid mangroves of
the equatorial region are an ecosystem of slithering, stealthy, venomous
creatures. The delicate balance of this habitat has been upset by the
invasive population of augers, which have decimated the breakwater
groves, threatening to erode the habitat.

The mission parameters are straightforward:

- Exterminate the invasive augers and return the bodies for incineration.
- Absolutely no harm must be done to native plants or wildlife.
- Environmental damage will incur heavy fines.

The forest of mangroves has water less than one meter deep over a
sandy floor. The water is nutrient-rich and opaque but flows clearer
further into the forest where it is filtered by plant life. The branches
of the mangroves reach up to three meters overhead. Small aquatic
creatures hide among the exposed roots of the mangroves whilst flyers
nest in the canopy. The network of waterways is navigable by small
craft, although the forest itself is dense and difficult to traverse on foot.
Attempts to walk without tripping or becoming entangled requires a
successful Routine (6+) DEX check.

Inspecting mangrove roots with an Average (8+) Survival check leads to
where augers have fed on the tree's soft roots, killing it. The occasional
auger is swept up by an ornate flying predator, only to counterattack
and kill it before scuttling back into seclusion. The pests must be
removed before they cause any further damage.

Dealing with the augers is simple, staying out of the way of the other
animals is the real problem. There are several colonies but locating
each comes with additional hazards, such as getting entangled in the
dense roots and being attacked by the augers whilst immobilised.
Trudging through the water will draw the attention of large amphibious
predators and floating jellyfish-like creatures must be avoided as they
contain a volatile gas capable of setting fire to the mangroves.

THE HUNTERS AND THE HUNTED


After exterminating several of the auger colonies – and hopefully
not much else – the Travellers encounter a wild quetzl. Remaining
camouflaged, it uses its psionic abilities to draw its prey towards it,
which it will bite and attempt to suffocate. Defending against a protected
species may be tricky for the Travellers, given the earlier warning from
Docent Moran. If this is not enough, a team of poachers tracking this
quetzl have found it at the same time as the Travellers, locking them in
a three-way fight.

The poachers are a pair of reconnaissance mercenaries who snuck
down from orbit to the planet's surface in a disguised cargo air/
raft some days ago. In order to capture the creature alive, they are
equipped with camouflaged vacc suits, stun grenades, tranq gas and
non-lethal weaponry. They can be seen attempting to subdue the
animal and load it into a rescue bubble for transportation but notice the
Travellers as soon as they enter the clearing. Their priority remains the
quetzl but will incapacitate the Travellers if they interfere.

If the Travellers decide to converse with the poachers, a successful
Difficult (10+) Persuade check informs them that they were hired by
Baronet Antoni, a flashy and decadent noble who awaits his quarry
aboard his yacht, the _Zaroff_. If all goes according to plan, the air/raft
should dock with a waiting ship's boat in low orbit in 90 minutes, then
flee the rest of the way to the _Zaroff._ A Very Difficult (12+) Persuade
check will inform them that the _Zaroff_ is awaiting the poachers at
the 100-diameter limit from the planet. After docking the ship's boat
aboard the _Zaroff_ , the mercenaries plan to escape to the neighboring
system Piiman (E76A786-7), the rich homeworld of Baronet Antoni. He
has hired them to add the specimen to his private zoo, giving each a
sizeable sum to achieve such a feat.

UP IN THE AIR


Poachers can get Cr200000 for a live quetzl but Docent Moran is
prepared to pay twice that to secure the specimen's safe return. If
the Travellers failed to secure the quetzl when they initially saw the
poachers, they are left with the option to secure it enroute to the _Zaroff_.

It is a race to alert the planetary authorities to the poaching of the quetzl
and to intercept the fleeing mercenaries. Despite contacting Docent
Moran or the planet's AI, nothing more advanced than a groundskeeper
drone is able to intercept the poachers before they reach the ship's
boat. The Travellers are the only ones close enough to pursue.

The air/raft chase takes them into orbit as the poachers attempt to
outrun their pursuers. The chase lasts 12 rounds before the poachers
are able to rendezvous with the ship's boat. Defeat during the chase
will force one or both groups to make a controlled descent back to the
surface, or they will be stranded in space.

Successfully intercepting the mercenaries will mean recovery of the
quetzl but will leave the Travellers in a precarious position. A rescue
bubble contains only 30 remaining minutes of oxygen and the return
trip to the surface will take twice that time due to the damaged state of
the air/raft. Whether the Travellers want to release a psionic wild animal
into an enclosed air/raft or let it suffocate in a bubble is up to them.

If the mercenaries do make it to the _Zaroff_ ', they are only a few
moments ahead of the Travellers and can be seen manoeuvring the
rescue bubble with the captured quetzl into the hold. This allows the
Travellers enough time to board the boat and attempt to recapture the
quetzl or to interfere with the boat's crew long enough for the planet's
security detail to reach them.

Once aboard the boat, the quetzl rips out of its rescue bubble and
begins hunting the crew, not caring to differentiate between the
poachers who kidnapped it and the Travellers who have come to its
rescue. It attempts to suffocate and consume prey but attacks with
its barbed tail if cornered. The crew of the ship's boat consists of the
two mercenaries, their air/raft pilot carrying only a sidearm, and the
boat's non-combat pilot. Baronet Antoni himself is on the yacht at the
100-diameter edge of the system. He will approach the ship's boat
when it is nearby, rendezvousing in just over two hours.

RESOLUTION


A successful mission would see the Travellers preventing the ship's
boat from reaching the _Zaroff_ , keeping the _Zaroff_ from jumping out or
retrieving the quetzl. Failing those, having a lead on the yacht and its
destination can lead to further adventure in another system.

Regardless of whether the Travellers are able to defeat the poachers or
rescue the quetzl from Baronet Antoni, they will earn their full payment
from Docent Moran for eliminating the augers, minus incidental
expenses for damage to the environment, of course.

A clumsy group or a calamitous firefight in the mangroves could actually
put the Travellers further into Docent Moran's debt, requiring more jobs
to repair the damage. If they kill a predator or any other native animal,
or are responsible for damage to plants or natural features, they could
see their reward whittled away to nothing. Treat fines in excess of the
final reward as a legal dispute regarding the planet's Destruction of
Property laws.

If the Travellers are able to reclaim the quetzl, or aid in its recapture,
Docent Moran will award them Cr400000 for the animal's return and her
opinion of offworlders will improve... slightly.

Telchine Mining Craft and Rhea Ore Barge
By Elliot Smorodinsky

The Telchine and the Rhea were developed by the Stavraki &
Satyros Free Mining Collective, as an alternative to the Agrilus/Sabre
combination from Lamarck Minerals. Yanos Stavraki felt that the
Lamarck equipment did not adequately meet the needs of belter life, so
set out to design a better option.

TELCHINE


Consisting of four sections joined in a square around an empty central
well, the 50-ton Telchine is a dispersed configuration. Sections of the
hull are of identical size and shape to make mass production easier
and cheaper. Within the front section are the bridge, sensors, a single
stateroom and a small common area. The two side sections each
carry a set of mining drones and a grappling arm. Maneuver drives
and the power plant are both located in the rear of the ship. The ship
is operational with only one or two multi-skilled individuals, although a
less skilled crew may need up to four people. A second stateroom has
been shoehorned into the engineering area for the purpose of housing
any extra crew needed.

The Telchine has minimal on-board cargo space, this instead being
accomplished by the interplanetary hauler net strung across the central
well. When the craft has found an ore deposit, it rotates to present its
sides to the asteroid and releases the mining drones. Drones deliver
their payloads into the hauler net with the aid of the grappling arms,
which can be gradually opened to accept greater amounts of ore.

Those who have seen the tiny Telchine on top of a bulging hauler net
have given it the unflattering nickname of 'Dung Beetle'. Unloading
the ore into a conventional cargo bay is an enormous pain, the only
significant downside to the Telchine's unorthodox cargo arrangement.

RHEA


The distinguishing feature of the Rhea is the 'hopper', an auxiliary cargo
bay that opens onto the dorsal side of the ship. The smaller ship clamps
onto the hopper, with anti-grav baffles and reinforced bulkheads to lessen
the impact of the falling ore. Cargo belts then carry the chunks of ore into
the main cargo bay.

Intended to be a self-contained mining unit, 1,500-ton Rhea carries four
Telchines in docking clamps. The Rhea can jump alone to sell the ore
when its cargo hold is full or can move the entire operation to a new
system altogether.

The Rhea carries a crew of nine in double-occupancy staterooms. One
notable feature is the larger than usual common area, allowing the
crews of all the ships to mingle. The other is the sizeable galley, built
due to Yanos's favorite saying, 'a well-fed ship is a happy ship'.

Zadony-Tessen Survival Armaments Inc.
By Andy Sykes

Zadony-Tessen have been manufacturing firearms and accessories
for use by starship crews in survival scenarios for centuries. They
are well-made rugged weapons constructed from quality materials,
designed to be ergonomic and easy to use for untrained operators.
Any user who does not have at least Gun Combat 0 only suffers DM-2
to attack rolls, not DM-3.

All ZT weapons come with three additional accessories: a backpack,
with an inbuilt holster for the weapon, a ZT ammunition belt and a
survival kit.

The Imperial Interstellar Scout Service has purchased examples of all
these ZT weapons and they are popular for their rugged reliability and
aesthetics. Many individual scouts acquire their own, especially the ZT-18 and ZT-28 pistols, purloined from ships lockers to use as personal
weapons. Any Scout receiving a Weapon as a Benefit may take one of
these weapons, including the ZT-38, despite it exceeding Cr1000.

SLUG PISTOLS


ZT-18 Survnaut Pistol: This is a three-barrelled break open pistol, with the
two upper side-by-side barrels chambered for 13mm pistol rounds and the
lower chambered for rifle rounds. The upper barrels may be discharged at
once at the same target, adding +3 to the damage. The ZT-18 comes with
a detachable shoulder stock that this doubles as a machete; the handle
connects to the butt of the pistol. The blade, contained in a padded fabric
cover, forms the stock. The cover can be removed in 1D rounds and when
detached the stock can be used as a blade.

At TL9 the ZT-18 can be purchased gyro stabilized, removing the Bulky
trait and adding one kilogram to weight and Cr400 to the cost.

ZT-28 Survnaut Revolver
```

ZT-28 Survnaut Revolver: This is an unusual design, the cylinder
resting at the rear of the weapon above the pistol grip and aligning
with the lower cylinder chamber. The whole cylinder can be removed
for easy reloading. Each ZT-28 comes with two screw-in barrels, in
differing calibres, with the spare resting in a slot under the current fitted
barrel. Changing the barrel is a simple matter of turning the knurled ring
at the muzzle and pulling the barrel away, then inserting the alternate
barrel and tightening the ring; this takes D3 rounds. The revolver can
use both 13mm pistol cylinders and rifle chambered cylinders. The ZT-28 comes with the same detachable shoulder stock as the ZT-18.

At TL9 the ZT-28 can be purchased gyro stabilized, removing the Bulky
trait and adding one kilogram to weight and Cr400 to cost.

At TL12 a laser barrel can be purchased for Cr750, to be used with
cartridge laser cylinders.

SLUG RIFLES


ZT-38 Survnaut Carbine: For crews concerned that they may lose
their highly trained astrogator to a wild animal that the ZT-18 or -28
cannot handle, the ZT-38 is offered. This is a longer barrelled ZT-18
with a non-detachable folding stock for ease of storage and portability.
The two upper barrels are chambered for big game rounds, the
lower for shotgun cartridges. The upper barrels may be discharged
simultaneously, adding +3 to the damage. It comes gyro stabilized as
standard and this somewhat reduces the fearsome recoil. However,
firing the weapon with the stock folded is not recommended and if this
is tried the upper barrels gain the Very Bulky trait. Also attached is a
small, non-detachable, folding bayonet.

ZT-Survnaut Hatchet: This is a combination weapon, usable as a normal
hatchet or a shotgun. The handle contains a simple breach mechanism,
close to the axe head and the handle forms a barrel. To utilise as a firearm
the user places the axe head in the shoulder, blade down and sights along
the handle. The shot exits at the base of the handle. It is a single shot
weapon that takes three minor actions to reload.

Alkisatl
By Isabella Treccani-Chinelli

Travellers may encounter Alkisatl at any downport, normally having recently
departed her ship. Often seen in nightclubs and shops, or even just exploring
the landscape, she is aloof when spoken to, believing the Travellers to be
beneath her. She will be distinctly rude if they are not Zhodani and it will take
no small amount of effort to persuade her they are not just liars and thieves.
With highly developed psionic abilities she is the epitomal representation of
all that is hated in Zhodani by both Vilani and Solomani, her powers being a
natural part of daily life. This makes travel to the Imperium less attractive to
Alkisatl, although on occasion she will attend trade meetings.

Spending time exploring Charted Space is a dream for many, one which
Alkisatl has made a reality, touring the Spinward Marches and Zhodani
Consulate. Her father remains fabulously wealthy thanks to his trading
of stocks and a large hereditary estate; she has never been pushed to
work, instead devoting her time to practicing psionics and travelling.

Recently, her father has suggested that she should continue her lessons
in governance, as she will soon be expected to take over his estate. Such
an idea is vaguely abhorrent to Alkisatl, who regards her personal freedom
as being of upmost importance. Not content with his plan, she has recently
been travelling with more frequency, hoping her sustained absences will
drive her father away from the idea. This might explain why she can be
found at a downport on almost any planet of the Referee's discretion.

Zhodani Female
```

The eldest daughter of a
Zhodani noble, Alkisatl is the
epitome of spoiled. Raised
on Chronor, she is an oddity
due to her obsession with
materialistic goods over
personal achievement. This
does not mean that she has
achieved nothing, however,
as she is a powerful psion in
her own right with numerous
publications under her
belt. She gradually drifted
away from mainstream
Zhodani thought processes,
idealising a life of freedom.
Having trained extensively
in the art of telempathy, she
is skilled in imposing her
emotions on others.

Her skills are often
'necessary' whenever
she wants to make a
sizeable purchase and the
possibility of her influencing
her father has been oft
discussed within her circle
of friends. Despite this, she
is not altogether unlikeable,
having an effortless way
of speaking to any she
encounters. She is well
trained in diplomacy and
personnel management,
her families' estate
having roughly 100 proles
constantly maintaining it and
serving her family. Lessons
in management began when
she was young and after
being tested for an aptitude
in telepathy she was
encouraged to practise this
on them. Delving into their
minds became somewhat of
a game to her.

LUDRIIEPR


Ludriiepr acts as driver, bodyguard and personal assistant for Alkisatl,
having been hired by her father two terms prior. This appointment was
good fortune for Ludriiepr; becoming a personal attendant to a member
of the nobility is highly sought after. It is hoped that her social status will
rub off on him and as her power grows his will too. The appointment is
fruitful, with him often guiding her away from some of her worse ideas.
His telekinetic abilities allow them to maneuver easily through many
situations and have the added benefit of making her entrances all the
more impressive.

He takes his duties seriously and will protect Alkisatl with his life if
need be. She has been nothing less than a perfect boss and her
need for exploration has allowed him to see Charted Space. Ludriiepr
was placed with an intendant family, having been born a prole. This
promotion to a noble's intendant is unusual and Ludriiepr is keenly
aware of the luck involved with his present situation.

PSARA


Built for the daughter of a Zhodani noble, the Psara is little more than a
fast transport vessel designed to ferry Alkisatl to wherever she wishes
to go. As it is only a small craft it does not have any jump capacity,
instead relying on hiring docking space within larger ships to travel long
distances. This is not the most efficient mode of travel but when you do
not particularly mind where you are going, it is an effective one. This
ship is her pride and joy, a direct representation of her idea of freedom.
If Travellers wish to board, they will be warmly welcomed by the crew,
provided Alkisatl is with them.

Featuring state of the art technology, the main stateroom is a custom
design, intended to reduce the effects of the psionics Alkisatl uses, a
necessary design feature. Any Imperial agents performing inspections
on the ship are tactfully guided away from this room under the pretence
of privacy. Despite her status in Zhodani society, Alkisatl and her crew
act like Travellers, although her exacting standards of cleanliness can
be hard to tolerate.

The ship is not designed for combat and the crew are trained to evade
battle as best they can; in the event of a fight breaking out the ship will
be seen flying away at great speed. It can sustain a few small hits and
once it is out of immediate danger, repair drones swarm the sides. This
was her fathers' singular stipulation of commissioning her the ship and
although she will not admit it, they have saved Alkisatl more than once.
Despite the small size of the Psara, it has a crew of four, including a
medic and an engineer. Alkisatl will offer to take up to four Travellers
wishing to accompany her at no cost, requiring they tell her stories of
their travels instead.

Designed for the Alkisatl by her father, the Merla was created purely
with comfort and luxury in mind. Featuring up-to-date technology and all

as ground transport whenever Alkisatl decides to visit a downport. Only
Alkisatl and Ludriiepr use the Merla, with the remaining crew tracking
their location using satellite uplink.

Her doting father spared no expense, outfitting the Merla with structural
reinforcements and electrostatic armor to ensure Alkisatl's safety.
The advanced autopilot allows Ludriiepr to leave his post if needed to
protect her. It has enough range to travel between most cities, although
if it runs out of power the Psara can be seen dipping out of the skies
above to collect it.

Amindii
**By Geir Lanesskog**

The Amindii are sophonts native to the Regina system. Comprising less
than a quarter of the population of their world, the Amindii remain the
dominant sophont in Regina's rural environments. While most maintain
their traditional culture in self-governing territories, many Amindii
participate in Regina's wider society and some have left Regina to
become Travellers in the wider galaxy.

PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS


As upright bilateral beings with four arms and two large legs, the Amindii
superficially resemble [[Terra|Terran]] grasshoppers, with internal skeletons within
their exterior of chitinous plates and finely scaled skin. Adults average 2.2
meters tall and mass approximately 110 kilograms. External colouration
varies with tribes but tends towards patterns of blue and purple which
evolved as camouflage in Regina's native forests.

The Amindii head is composed of a large round skull plate encasing the
brain and a facial plate that contains two small eyes and an opening
for the large beak-like mouth. Vision is focused on near ultraviolet to
green spectra, and hearing is limited to fairly insensitive ear holes at the
junction of facial and skull plates, but an Amindii's entire body acts as
a receptor of infrasound. Smell is accomplished by receptors within the
mouth and is both acute and closely associated with taste.

EVOLUTIONARY DEVELOPMENT


As members of Regina's most common surface fauna phylum, the
Amindii have essentially shed two of their eight limbs as they became
upright walkers. Their ancestors were small-group herbivores but the
species became omnivorous to allow them to take advantage of a
wider set of food options. Regina's high rate of volcanism, including
relatively frequent supervolcano eruptions likely provided the seed
to spark sentience in the proto-Amindii. Intelligence and tool use
emerged as a substitute for the hibernation reflex employed by most
Reginan fauna and gave the proto-Amindii a strong advantage in
exploiting scarce resources.

LIFE CYCLE


As with much Reginan fauna, the Amindii have three genders: egg
donor, activator and a bearer who carries the fertilised embryo to term
over a period of approximately 300 standard days. While mating usually
involves simultaneous contact between all three genders, a bearer
can act as an intermediary, carrying an egg for up to a week before its

fertilization by an activator.
Most births are singular,
although monozygotic twins
do occur if an embryo splits
during early development. The
three parents of the offspring
are called a Triad but this
formation is specific to the
offspring and not a permanent
familial unit.

An Amindii is considered an
adult at 14 standard years and
has a natural life expectancy of
65–80 years. Amindii children
are able to walk at birth and
require less care than human
offspring. Familial relationships
are weak, with activators and
egg donors less involved with
their children, who are raised
communally within their tribe,
band or village unit.

HISTORY


Proto-Amindii achieved full
sentience at least 200,000
years ago, based on
archaeological evidence of
tool use on the continent of
Noncredo. Emergence of
upright walking behaviour
occurred prior to five million
years ago, with the shift from
herbivorous forest gatherer
bands to omnivorous hunter/
gatherer behaviour correlated
to the emergence of tool use
on Noncredo. A minority of
paleoxenologists have put
forth competing origin theories
involving other continents and
it is certainly true that these
hunter/gatherers had reached
the continents of Feni, Makan,
Ishkis and Queenland prior to
50,000, pre-Imperial, forming
the basis of the five present
Amindii cultures.

Technology developed slowly and in parallel amongst the divergent
Amindii populations, with agriculture supplementing a traditional
lifestyle and permanent villages forming the basis of tribal life. The
Amindii remained close to their forest origins, except in Queenland
where the Idinii culture spent much of its developmental period in
a semi-subterranean existence, residing in the region's extensive
limestone and volcanic cave systems.

By -1000, the Amindii had advanced to TL2, although their society
mostly remained rural and tribal based. Machinery and invention
centred around practical items such as ploughs and water wheels,
writing was used primarily for record-keeping, not literature, and the
continents remained isolated, with only the Ka*tamii of the Makan
archipelago developing large ocean-going vessels. In approximately
-1000 a Zhodani research expedition first contacted the Mi*ti Amindii of
Ishkis, resulting in friendly relations. The Zhodani established a small
permanent science-oriented settlement at the modern city of Princips
on Ishkis prior to -900. This settlement persisted into the Imperial period
until the early 800s.

Settlers from the Third Imperium reached Regina in the Imperial year
75 and established a colony on the continent of Noncredo, contacting
the Tida*ii. As the Imperial mostly-human population rapidly expanded,
so did its influence on the Tida*ii Amindii, leading to both friction and
partial assimilation, although not initially as equals. Unrest followed
by 640 but mostly took the form of non-violent protests and legal
challenges. These resulted in better conditions for the increasingly
assimilated Tida*ii and the negotiation of reservation treaties, first with
the Ni*dami and then with the other Amindii cultures by 750.

By 1000, the Amindii had adapted to the Imperial presence on their
world, participating when desired but otherwise able to govern
themselves. Whilst now a minority on their own world, they occupy
more than 80% of the habitable regions of Regina, with Imperial society
mostly concentrated in urban areas.

SOCIETY


Except for the mostly assimilated Tida*ii, the Amindii retain their
original cultures and languages. While the Idinii depend heavily on
vocalization and inflection to convey meaning, the other four Amindii
cultures combine vocalizations, posture and hand gestures to convey
meaning. Vocalization among these four cultures is generally flat,
whilst emotive content is reliant on gestures that vary greatly among
the disparate cultures.

An Amindii's communication style requires additional understanding
from species unfamiliar with them. An Amindii may appear calm when
gestures indicate otherwise and, conversely, an Amindii may place
unintended meaning in causal gestures from other species. Such

misunderstandings are infrequent among Amindii working closely with
other species, such as the Amindii frontline bureaucrats and security
personnel often encountered at Regina's starports.

Village, clan and tribe membership governs traditional Amindii society.
Bearers, who control mating success, often play a leading role in
politics and social matters. Bearer dominance is especially strong in
Idinii society but is evident among all traditional Amindii cultures. With
the advent of treaties with the government of Regina, the five disparate
cultures of Amindii are legally five semi-sovereign nations but national
institutions are weak compared to tribal bonds and structures.

EXTERNAL RELATIONS


By treaty, all Amindii are Imperial citizens. As such, they have the rights
and responsibilities shared by all sophonts within the Imperium. Amindii
cultures are semi-sovereign nations, with full self-government and control
over their territories and citizens, although the government of Regina
and by extension the Third Imperium are responsible for foreign relations
and defence. Various arrangements with Regina's government allow for
transport networks to traverse reservation land and ensure the rights of
both Amindii and outsiders are respected within reservation territory.

Assimilated Amindii have achieved status as full citizens of Regina
and are often employed in government and industry. The Amindii have
a reputation for strong attention to detail and mechanical aptitude. As
a result of discrimination in previous centuries, few Amindii are willing
to accept subservient positions or perform menial duties. Amindii are
readily accepted into police and military roles. To emphasise the Amindii
heritage of his world, the Duke of Regina maintains the 4519th Lift Infantry
Regiment (Regina's Own), trained and equipped to Imperial standards.

Public venues and facilities on Regina are required to accommodate
Amindii citizens, seen in the high ceilings and wide passageways that
predominate among Regina's otherwise compact cities.

CREATING AMINDII TRAVELLERS


Amindii Travellers are uncommon but not rare, especially in the vicinity
of Regina. Although most Amindii spend their lives on reservation land,
living a fairly simple rural existence, tens of millions have adapted to
Imperial society and of these hundreds of thousands have spent at
least some time offworld.

Gender
An Amindii Traveller can be one of three genders. The Traveller can
either chose a gender, or roll 1D:
1 Activator; 2–3 Egg Donor; 4–6 Bearer.

Characteristics
All Amindii Travellers have the following modifiers applied to their
characteristics: STR 3D, DEX +1.

Additionally, activators receive STR +2 and EDU -2, whilst bearers
receive END +1.

Traits
Amindii Travellers all possess the following traits:

Multi-limbed: Amindii have two sets of arms, allowing them to perform
two sets of non-movement actions in any round without penalty.

Amindii Hands: Amindii hands are not suited to equipment designed
for humans. Apply DM-1 to all checks using tools or weapons not
designed for Amindii.

Perception: Amindii are able to perform the equivalent of Life Detection (see Traveller Core Rulebook, page 230) once per hour by making a
Recon check. This is not a true psionic power and cannot be blocked
with shields.

Low Berth Survival: Amindii do not suffer a negative DM in low berth
equipment not designed for their species. In addition, they receive
DM+1 to all low berth survival checks.

Psionics
An Amindii has normal psionic potential if discovered, tested and
trained, but receives DM+1 when checking for Telepathy and
Awareness talents.

Careers
All careers from the Traveller Core Rulebook are suitable for Amindii.
For their first term, unassimilated Amindii cannot pursue pre-education
options and must start as Citizen (colonist) or Drifter (barbarian) but can
qualify for any career or education option in subsequent terms.

Assimilated Amindii receive the additional background skill of Mechanic
0; unassimilated Amindii receive Survival 0 instead.

Amindii Travellers begin their first term at age 14 and must begin to
check for aging at the conclusion of their fourth term at age 30.

Jreine
**By Craig Bunting**

Generally flying in a flock, each adult is only half a kilogram and
resembles a hairless [[Terra|Terran]] bat but with a long muzzle-like head ending
in a vicious fanged mouth.

Jreine are a principle flying predator and attack any larger flying
creatures and objects by clinging on, biting and defecating. A flying
object will be mobbed by 3D bats, which latch on and attack the softest
bits they can find. The jreine breed readily and if there is not enough
roosting space, fights break out often. They are blind and navigate
using echolocation.

Vindictor Logging Heavy Walker

By Sandrine Thirache

This walker is manufactured on Ballista Five, a small planet with a
tainted atmosphere, by Logarro Enterprises and Co., in order to fulfil
the demand of the many local logging companies. Logarro updates its
models on a regular basis and is the main repurchaser of the obsolete
versions. Indeed, they lead a second-hand market for the machines,
which are then re-sold to private owners for a fraction of the price (50%
to 75%). These are mostly starter companies or private individuals who
have the intention of customising their new acquisition.

Ballista Five is covered in microfauna but its main abundant plant life
is a species of incredibly tough trees. As the wood is so solid, logging
requires the use of specific heavy-duty tools. This is where the Vindictor
Logging Heavy Walker comes in. This heavy walker (containing a team
of one pilot and one cutter/logger) is capable of cutting the whole length
of a thick tree trunk, lifting it and charging it into the back of a massive
truck bound for the factory.

Icebox Found at the Exe Cutoff
By Donald Orr

A dying signal GK (mayday) beams weakly from well beyond the jump
limit of the Exe system's secondary gas giant – an unlikely place for
an ambush despite the shortcut's reputation. Aboard the gutted Hraye-class scout (see Aliens of Charted Space: Volume 1, page 70) sleeps a
single survivor, the forgotten bait of an ill-planned pirate trap.

EXE


The Borderland, Trojan Reach
The system of Exe is practically uninhabited, except for the skeleton crew
of the Class A starport built by the General Development Corporation
as a stopover for its own vessels. This facility orbits a small moon of the
larger of two gas giants and has automated refinement, refuelling and
repair facilities. This installation may seem like an odd investment but
GeDeCo thinks in terms of decades, if not centuries. The rest of the Exe
system is an empty wasteland of asteroids and barren worlds, a stopover
made valuable only by its convenient placement.

There are a few accepted routes through The Borderlands and Exe
is not seen as one of them. Most captains flying a jump-3 trader will
take the shortest path via Acrid and Tech-World, paying their way into
state-sponsored convoys if they have the Credits or connections. Less
well-equipped outfits will need to take the jump-2 route via Argona and
Sperle, which sees infrequent patrols by regional navies but enough
traffic to offer a timely rescue, if called for. Travel by the 'Exe Cutoff', on
the other hand, is more of a gambit: it shaves two weeks off the jump-2
transit time between Tyokh and Fist but there is little chance of help if
something goes wrong in-system.

Of course, all enterprises in the Trojan Reach carry a certain amount
of risk. It is a dangerous region. The Hierate imports technological
goods, while the Imperium imports raw and precious materials from the
Ya'soisthea Aslan but the truce between the two empires is predicated
upon a buffer zone of independent worlds incapable of policing
commerce or projecting appreciable force. Trade is certainly welcomed
but not at all secure under this arrangement, so corporate and other
unaffiliated entities are left to protect their own interests.

BEACON DETECTED


Orbiting at some distance from the secondary gas giant of Exe is the
gutted wreck of the Penniless Prince, a 100-ton Hraye-class scout. The
vessel is completely derelict except for three systems: a bank of low
berths, a distress beacon broadcasting intermittently on all frequencies
and rapidly decaying batteries. There is a reasonable chance that a
vessel emerging from jumpspace would do so close to the gas giant,
rather than the primary gas giant, as probably intended, and it is also
possible that such a vessel could detect the faint distress beacon
coming from deep space – an unlikely place for an ambush, even here.

If a ship investigated, they would find the remains of an Aslan-built but
long-since pawned scout, riddled with laser blasts and adrift. Multiple
airlocks have been breached with boarding charges, the cargo hold has
been blown open and all cargo the ship might have been carrying is
gone. Any components that survived the battle have been pillaged, the
ammunition racks emptied and even the hull itself has been stripped
for the bulk value of its alloys. All evidence, in short, points to a pirate
attack that was resisted with an utterly failed defence, all hands being
lost or captured... except for one. Sensors may detect a single lifeform
frozen inside one of the ship's three low berths, not something a Hraye
is usually equipped with in the first place.

Fortunately, the ship's emergency battery has held out for this long but
is unlikely to last much longer. The wreck itself is all but unsalvageable.
It could be towed back to a shipyard but the repairs needed to make
her spaceworthy again would be so extensive that it would likely be
cheaper to acquire an entirely new ship.

THE LIE AND THE TRUTH


Reviving the person inside the low berth is a straightforward if technical
procedure, only complicated by the loss of cabin pressurization aboard
the Penniless Prince and the rescuer's possible lack of advanced
medical facilities.

The rescued spacer is in his mid-thirties, with grey eyes and sandy
brown, shoulder-length hair. He is an intelligent, but slightly awkward,
person that does not look anyone in the eye. His clothing is utilitarian
but torn up, as if he had been in a fight. Introducing himself as Rabin
Moore (his real name) from Pandora (true), he claims that he was
one of three crew members aboard the Prince, an independent ship
engaged in speculative trade. He says they were intercepted by pirates
while transporting livestock purchased from Gor. One of his mates let
the story slip and a raider vessel followed them from Cordan. The crew
was captured to be sold as slaves to agents of the Glorious Empire but
the raiders' corsair had too few low berths so he, the puniest specimen,
was left behind.

This is a believable story but there are some inconsistencies. Why
would a corsair, a sizeable vessel, waste time pursuing a single scout
from one system to another? Why did the crew of the Penniless Prince
risk the Cutoff in the first place? These, and others, are questions Rabin
might not have good answers for.

In fact, the above is a lie. Rabin is actually an electronics security
specialist with a small pirate crew that runs overly complex jobs in
The Borderlands, and he was chosen as bait for his technical, not
interpersonal skills. As the resident computer hacker for 'Gronzi's
Gang', the ploy was for Rabin to be frozen inside the low berth, be

rescued, then disable the rescuing ship's maneuver drive and weapon
systems as it jumped into Cordan or Tech-World. Here, other members
of the crew would be ready for some signal from Rabin.

Little does Rabin know that he has been frozen in that low berth for
a little over two years. The gang, poorly equipped and not entirely
competent, was caught by a former mark and ambushed themselves
shortly after setting the trap here. Only five members survived,
including Gronzi himself. Any one of them could have made their way
back to Exe to rescue their erstwhile companion, yet none did.

PATRONAGE


Rabin is not a fool, despite the foolish company he kept. Once he
realises that he has been left for dead, he will decide a course of action
based on the qualities of his rescuers. If they seem like upstanding
citizens, he is likely to stick to his original story, asking to be dropped off
at the nearest sizeable starport on the Travellers' way.

However, if they are a less reputable crowd he might come out with the
truth and offer to put them in touch with his connection for privateering
work; Tomlin, a scarred veteran living a few jumps away on the lawless
backwater of Arunisiir. Hopefully, he is still there and still offering work.

Pirates in the Trojan Reach often moonlight as privateers. A sanctioned
contact will provide the pirate crew with a list of passphrases that an
aligned ship can use to slip the net and, in return, the pirate can expect
a sizeable reward from the contact when they next check in. Usually,
these 'contractors' do not know who they are working for, that information
being kept hidden by their contact. Gronzi's Gang had unknowingly been
serving the interests of the Company of Grandmotherly Kindness, the
most dominant trade entity among the Ya'soisthea Aslan, which works
industriously to maintain trade between the Imperium and Hierate as well
as their own place at the head of the table.

Of course, it is best practice that they not admit to such activity. Among
the Aslan, it would not be frowned upon – but their human trade
partners might not be so understanding of sponsored piracy. Humans
often prefer to keep such arrangements implicit. To them, knowing and
acknowledging are two entirely different things. Therefore, this side of
business is done through proxies, deniable connections paid well for
their disposability.

In addition to putting interested rescuers in touch with his privateering
contact, it is also possible that Rabin would seek vengeance against
his former crew. He has a vindictive streak, enough funds saved to offer
a reasonable bounty and can provide a detailed description of his old
gang. They are likely still running jobs with new crews but Rabin would
not know where. Rabin himself resides on Theev, where he owns a
small apartment.

Captain Mreni
By Isabella Treccani-Chinelli

Despite the fact his previous crew all claimed he had 'delusions of
grandeur'; Captain Mreni knows his worth. Raised on a backwater
planet in the middle of The Beyond, Mreni grew up sailing ships, street
fighting and studying ancient languages. Realising there was more to
life than the planet he grew up on, he stowed away. Tucked within a
cargo crate on an IISS scout ship, he stayed there for weeks, surviving
from packaged food stored inside his bag.

However, stowing oneself away on an Imperial scout ship turned out to
be an unintelligent decision. Believing him to be a spy hired by either
the Zhodani or the Aslan, the Imperium took Mreni into custody and
his health rapidly started to decline. He was accustomed to clear skies
and fresh air, and possessed an almost relentless need for exploration.
Being trapped within a small, dank cell left him unstable at best.

What the IISS did not take into account was that their new captive was,
in fact, exactly who he said he was. His distinction as a captain seemed
almost laughable but on his homeworld he was seen as an enterprising
young pirate. Launching a fleet of windborne ships, Mreni was hailed
as the most fearsome man on the ocean. During his time raiding and
pillaging, he furthered his studies of Vilani, often masquerading as a
member of the lower nobility in order to canvass targets.

When released from imprisonment, after being subjected to years of
interrogation by IISS intelligence officers, Mreni attempted to reintegrate
into society. For a while, he was the captain of a refurbished far trader,
given to him as recompense for everything he endured by the IISS; all
under the table, of course. They could not publicly admit to holding an
innocent stowaway hostage for years. This lasted for two short years,
before his crew mutinied and left him on yet another backwater planet.

Now diminished in stature, Mreni is still a sight. Missing his lower right
leg, with a bandage-turned-eyepatch strapped over his left eye, he
holds himself with an almost dignified air. Although his clothes are now
more patchwork than original fabric, he has retained the energy of a
man who knows what he is talking about. Prone to long silences, where
his eyes hold a faraway look, Mreni is a rather unimposing fellow. This
demeanour covers his natural tendency towards violence, a holdover
from his more egregious history.

Captain Mreni can be encountered at almost any starport, no matter
the quality, having drifted around Imperial space for many a year now.
Often shrouded with a tattered cloak, his crudely fitted prosthetic leg
can be heard from a considerable distance. The soft clunking precedes
him wherever he goes, heading on some wayward mission in an
attempt to earn money to pay for a suitable replacement. Despite his
former glory, he is now almost entirely destitute, sleeping in doorways
and under tarpaulins, moved on daily by whatever security forces exist
on the planet he is currently squatting on.

When encountered by Travellers, he will present himself as nothing
more than a humble beggar. Complimenting the armor or weapons of
the Travellers, he will initiate conversation with those he believes may
help reinstate his former glory. Mreni is a useful addition to a ship's
crew and will join the crew for half the salary of a traditional gunner (Cr1000 per month), provided a successful Difficult (10+) Persuade
check is made.

Belvedere Station
By Donald Orr

The planetary government of New has refitted their spaceport's orbital
fuel depot into a full-service space station and applied for a Class C
rating hoping to increase trade and tourism to the world. They now
await the report of a covert detached duty scout, expected to be
conducting the starport review any day.

The planet of New (Trojan Reach 3016) is a farming world, a frontier
paradise of rolling plains where livestock graze and automated tractors
make predictable rounds. Settlements are few and far between, most
are simple market towns where farmers and ranchers warehouse their
stock in great, refrigerated complexes until the goods can be sold
offworld. The planet's best-known export is remswort, a large thistle
that, when steamed, yields a fleshy and nutritious choke considered a
regional delicacy.

The New starport has always been a modest affair. There are a few
concrete landing pads to accommodate streamlined vessels, plenty
of warehousing to store exports and, historically, a minimal refuelling
depot in orbit to service the bulk agri-traders that cannot weather the
planet's atmosphere. There is a Scout Service base but it is nothing
more than a dusty landing strip with a small parts closet and one
administrator with a fear of flying.

Recently, the elected bureaucrats of New have sought to upgrade the
starport to Class C, believing that doing so will drive trade and tourism
to the backwater world. Most jump 2 traders bypass New in favor of the
Class B ports at Imasaa or Eshadi. To accomplish this task economically,
they have chosen to retrofit the existing fuel depot – previously a one-man operation – to a fully-fledged highport and grandiosely renamed it
Belvedere Station. This retrofit was completed only recently and includes
spartan repair, entertainment and dining facilities.

Belvedere Station awaits the inspections of a covert IISS representative
due to arrive soon. The Scout Service often reviews starport ratings at
the request of the Starport Authority, frequently employing detached
service scouts to review station services without alerting station staff
that they are doing so.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION


To the untrained observer, Belvedere Station is a small space station
that appears to be somehow oddly mismatched. Those with spacefaring
experience or training in structural engineering recognize that it has been
converted from a pre-existing orbital installation. The old depot is still
fully intact and makes up half the bulk of the station, in the form of three
large steel drums capped by a small habitation complex; the newer half
of the station was added onto the other end of the fuel drums. While the
old depot simply ran fuel lines to ships being serviced while their shuttles
loaded agricultural products from the planet below, the new station can
dock two large and four smaller vessels through a combination docking
umbilical and landing pad structure and offers guests a few services.
These include scheduled shuttles to the downport, a chef-run dining
establishment, a combination bar/casino, a few overnight staterooms and
the repair know-how of a backwater mechanic.

Belvedere Station is in geosynchronous orbit with the downport. The
promenade of the newer section has an incredible view of the planet
below, while the old hab complex faces the starry night. The only way to
reach the old hab is via spacewalk, along an external ladder that runs
the length of the scaffolding.

Inside, the station feels like the economy model of a newly purchased
handcomp. The walls are freshly brushed aluminium, the steel grating
still has its mold lines and the ceramic ceilings are still bright white.
It all lacks the cosmetic wear exhibited by most space stations. This is
in stark contrast to everything else on New, where a high-quality but
broken-in saddle earns a respectful nod.

About 10 people typically live on Belvedere Station. Some are savvy
void-wanderers lured here for their experience in return for a regular
paycheck or government subsidy. Others are old ranch-hands from the
planet below. A few are lifelong bureaucrats for whom this is just the
latest posting or perhaps a career stepping-stone.

PERSONALITIES


Jamison Clintock, Assistant Starport Director: Tall, gaunt and in
his early 40's, Jamison's clothing is perfectly pressed and his greying
hair neatly combed-over his small, bald head. A local bureaucrat that
transferred some years ago from the New Tax and Excise Office to the
Imperial Starport Authority, Jamison is more eager than anyone else
for Belvedere to succeed. Since being assigned the project as a junior
administrator, he has managed it from start to finish and his efficiency
in doing so has led to several promotions. If this work culminates as
he hopes in getting the starport upgraded to Class C, it will likely put
him next in line for Director. Clintock is from New but hails from a
bureaucratic family as opposed to the farming and ranching origins
celebrated by most of New.

Fox Ocano, Decent Mechanic: A self-described decent mechanic,
Fox is in his early 30's and learned how to fix a grav-tractor 'at his
mama's hip'. Fox is one of two local, farm-raised employees of the
New highport, the other being Markov Galvin the shuttle pilot. The two
are close friends but disagree on a fair amount, including on whether
this new highport is a good idea. Fox thinks it is and this shows in
his eagerness for his work. He toils all day and night to ensure the
station is in tip-top shape for the imminent IISS inspection and has an
extremely friendly, if folksy, demeanour that tends to put people at ease.

Galvin Markov, Shuttle Pilot: As the shuttle pilot who ferries
passengers between Belvedere Station and the New downport, Galvin
spends a good deal of his time in the cockpit of the SPA's passenger-outfitted launch. Having grown up on one of the many farms of New
and 'earned his wings' flying cargo runs between the market towns and
the downport, Galvin would proudly call himself a 'local yokel'. He has a
country drawl and a not insignificant dislike of the new highport, which
he does not mind sharing with strangers. This could be problematic,
given that he also doubles as shuttle steward to tourists for the duration
of their two-hour descent and return journey.

**Holbrook Erring, Starport Security:** Being a small, surface installation
mostly dealing in agricultural goods, security at New has always been
provided by local staff, little more than a few country folk equipped with
badges and shotguns. The exception to that is the chief of security,
Holbrook Erring, an unpopular man with locals, mostly because he
keeps them in line. He is a genuinely friendly person and a veteran
merchant marine who served on several independent traders
frequenting the dust-spice trade route. He wears a simple uniform,
has a small belly, carries a stunner and can often be found at the Bull
Moose socialising with anyone in earshot.

Jo-Job the Fuel Rat: The oldest resident of Belvedere Station has also
lived there the longest. Nearly 60 years old, Jo-Job has been employed
at this orbital installation for more than half of his life, having been the
station's sole occupant when it was still known as 'the Tank'. Jo-Job is
a man of few words. Perhaps decades of living alone here changed him
into an introvert or perhaps he took the job because he appreciates the
space. Nevertheless, he has just recently learned to enjoy the company
of others. In the evenings he can often be found at the restaurant or
bar, quietly observing people from afar before trekking back across the
exterior of the station to his old hab complex.

**Bruglio, just Brulio:** The head chef of the Belvedere Restaurant and
Inn is a conceited man, truly skilled in his art but down on his luck due
to a few bad habits. An inspired chef, he left his homeworld of Tobia to
escape his creditors and has taken up a contract on New ostensibly to
find culinary inspiration in locally sourced ingredients. In fact, he would
likely have taken any decently paying job, as long as it was off Tobia.
He refuses to divulge his family name, insisting on people calling him
by his given name only. His wife, Anastasia, accompanied him on this
venture and acts as the Inn's server and stewardess.

**Anastasia Bruglio, the Stewardess:** The server and stewardess at
the Belvedere Restaurant and Inn, Anastasia is a beautiful, intelligent,
middle-aged woman who has had a successful career as a hospitality
manager back on Tobia. Her skills are being rather underutilised
here but she has come to support Bruglio in his endeavors at some
expense to herself. Having been engaged in the hospitality industry
in the sector capital, Anastasia is versed in social etiquette and
surprisingly well-connected and she lends an air of class that contrasts
with her surroundings.

Tchek'ra, Humble Barkeep: This female Aslan is the owner and
operator of the Bull Moose Bar and Casino. She is the widow of a
young male killed in a territorial dispute two decades ago and, left
destitute, has worked as a broker and underworld contact to Aslan
syndicates in the Trojan Reach. Tchek'ra often travels between the
Hierate and Imperium. She recently saved enough money to start her
own business and, ever thrifty, was attracted to Belvedere Station by
the impressive subsidies offered by the New government. She lacks the
social niceties of many barkeepers, being perhaps a little too direct, but
the station staff have taken a liking to her nonetheless.

Henrik Riordonson, Janitor and Gardener: A tall, lean and very
blonde man in his middle years, Henrik projects an air of experience,
competence and intelligence that belies his position as station's
janitor. He seems content, however, pushing his wheeled bucket
and mop around the station to disinfect patches that the auto-cleaners fail to and tending to the planted emplacements around
the promenade. He does not talk much about himself but is a great
listener and enjoys making friends with passers through, often
interjecting himself into their conversations.

**Annoying Tourists:** A group of four young tourists from coreward
have found themselves on New, after the tramp ship that carried them
abandoned them here. They are privileged, fashionable, annoying and
desperate to buy passage back to a more centralised starport to find a
connection home. They are staying at the Inn.

LOCATIONS



**1. Docking Umbilical**
The New Starport sees between four and six ships per week, most
of which are smaller, streamlined vessels that choose to land at the
downport. Those that dock at Belvedere Station tend to be larger,
unstreamlined ships needing to load bulk agricultural goods using
their own shuttles, which often takes days. To accommodate these
large vessels economically, the space station employs an umbilical
corridor that extends 100 meters from the body of the station, permitting
two large ships to dock with the small station at the same time. The
engagement mechanism is no more than a double-action airlock with a
universal scaffold, a simple yet versatile configuration.
**2. Landing Pads**
The docking umbilical joins perpendicularly with the station itself at
the landing pad complex, a cuboid structure that is shorter than it is
wide. An airlock and landing pad is built into each of the four external
surfaces. The two smaller landing pads can each accommodate a
ship of up to 200 tons; the larger two can each accommodate a ship of
400 tons. These are not proper hangers, they only offer an anchoring
point for ships to maglock themselves to the station while engaging
their airlocks, allowing for safe ingress and egress. Each of these
four landing pads, as well as the docking umbilical, lead to the central
chamber, which itself opens onto the main concourse of the station.
3. Promenade
The 'Promenade' is a modest affair, a small, communal space that
connects the dining, entertainment and hospitality facilities that
Belvedere Station offers. It is 10 meters wide and 20 meters long, with
two storefronts to the left and two to the right that open with large, roll-up doorways. The ceiling, five meters high, terminates in a skylight with
an unobstructed and inverted view of New; inexperienced spacers may
find the floating planet above them unsettling. The décor is generically
welcoming, with several plant installations showing off the local flora
being built behind low bannisters to give travelling groups a sense
of privacy, openness and nature, all at once. There are tables and
uncomfortable chairs to allow people to congregate for a short time.

To the right, the nearest sign reads 'Repair Bay', then further out,
'Shuttle Hangar'. Both outfits are identified on official-looking placards.
To the left, there are two independent establishments: first, the 'Bull
Moose Bar and Casino', and then the 'Belvedere Restaurant and Inn'.
At the end of the concourse, a fifth door is identified as the Starport
Authority Office and a sixth, more obscure door is labelled 'Station
Crew Only'.

4. Repair Bay
The entrance to the repair bay is a small, steel-grate platform
protected from a long fall with a thin, metal guardrail. Past a gate with
an 'employees only' sign on it, a long flight of stairs descends to the
repair bay floor, a space that is 20 meters deep, 30 meters wide and
60 meters deep. The walls of this cavernous space are adorned with
specialized tools and wheeled ladders facilitating access to implements
that would otherwise be out of reach. The grating below has been
constructed so that individual tiles can be removed in segments,
revealing another five meters of empty space for use as parts storage
or extra clearance. The entire place smells like grease.

The opposite wall is plain steel and completely bare, with crenelations
running horizontally across the center. It opens outward onto the void,
allowing the bay to accept a spaceborne vehicle of up to 50 tons. The
repair bay is divided into two halves, a near end and a far end, by a
retracting aperture that can be closed to allow the repair bay to be used
as a giant airlock. A series of 18 hydraulic clamps are recessed into the
ceiling and floor.

Like most establishments at Belvedere Station, the repair bay is a state-sponsored enterprise. The staff that work the repair bay are employees
of the government of New and, in addition to their regular stipend,
receive a commission on any work done to ships passing through.

**5. Shuttle Hangar**
The lighting in the shuttle hangar is different from the rest of the station.
It is a bright, almost dazzling white, illuminating rows of uncomfortable-looking chairs facing towards the small airlock in the opposite wall.
A desk stands in front of the airlock, generally unmanned unless the
shuttle is currently docked with the station. In that case, the desk
is occupied by the shuttle pilot who doubles as ticketing agent and
steward. Behind the desk, a backlit sign announces the next shuttle
departure or arrival, likely some hours away.

The New highport is in geosynchronous orbit with the downport at an
elevation of 35,000 kilometers. To facilitate the movement of people
and petty goods between the surface and Belvedere Station, the shuttle (actually just a 20-ton launch) operates twice daily service. It departs
the downport at 0800, arrives at Belvedere Station two hours later,
then completes two circuits before ending service at 1900 back at the
downport. At present, there is incredibly little traffic. Most ships that call

upon New are either small, streamlined craft that choose to land at the
downport directly; or bulk agri-traders that are equipped with and prefer
to use their own cargo launches.

The shuttle, like the station itself, is obviously new. It is configured to
carry 20 passengers: five rows of four, with two seats on either side of a
central aisle. The fare is Cr100 per person, including overhead stowage
of up to two suitcases each not to exceed 22 kilograms in weight.
Additional baggage allowance can be purchased at the rate of Cr50 per
bag and carrying or stowing firearms is not allowed. There is a single
toilet and a hot beverage bar that can be enjoyed for the first hour of
the journey, until the atmospheric descent has begun.

6. Bull Moose Bar and Casino
The Bull Moose Bar and Casino is the first door to the left when exiting
the landing pad complex and it invites arriving crew and passengers
with a happy tune played on an auto-piano in the corner. The entire
establishment has been built as an homage to the ranch-style saloons
of the planet below and in the great tradition of cheap tourist knockoffs,
is a great deal more kitsch than the original article. Unlike the rest of
the station, the interior walls here are composed of corrugated steel
panels that curve inwards from the floor, towards the ceiling, to give
the impression of being inside one of the prefabricated metal hulls that
compose most farming communities on New. Hidden smoke machines
somewhere in the room are releasing a thin, pipe smoke-scented fog.

The room is built on two levels. The upper level hosts a long bar that
curves away to the right, neon signs glowing behind the bar to advertise
several local alcoholic brews. New being an agricultural world, there is
a fine selection of grain spirits and malted beer, no doubt marked up
at least 10 times from what they would fetch at one of the bars the Bull
Moose is imitating. Four small tables are clustered to the left, for those
that prefer not to sit at the bar.

A gambling pit is separated from the bar by a high bannister, the few
stairs leading down giving the impression of stepping down into the
earth. The gambling enterprise itself is a small operation consisting of
a dozen Credit-fed machines of chance along the wall to the left and
three table games to the right: one card game, one dice game and one
roulette-style table, each moderated by an automated dealing machine.

Generally, the establishment is empty, despite it being the only place
of entertainment on the station. There are usually a handful of station
employees seated together at the bar, sipping their beers from frosted
mugs and talking with one another and the female Aslan serving
them. The Deputy Starport Administrator, a younger and immaculately
uniformed man, often chooses to read his reports here rather than in
his cramped office.

7. Belvedere Restaurant and Inn
Like the station itself, the name 'Belvedere Restaurant and Inn' is
something of a grandiose misnomer. Whatever they are expecting,
Travellers are met with a utilitarian diner that nonetheless serves
excellent food and happens to have a few economy staterooms nestled
in the basement. The restaurant is a small, well-lit, efficient operation,
its menu focusing on local produce as selected and prepared by a
professional chef hired from Tobia.

There is a bar built into the left side of the area, where individual diners
usually opt to sit. The kitchen is built behind the bar and accessed
through a pair of swinging doors. A handful of free-standing tables are
arranged in the middle of the room to host larger parties and booths
offering more privacy are built into the righthand wall. The back of
the diner is composed entirely of window, offering a gorgeous view of
New's gently curving horizon, juxtaposed against the star-spangled
void. A lift in the corner of the restaurant leads to the hotel area, below.

Guests of the hotel are issued a keycard that allows them to take the
lift downstairs. Here, there is a private lounge, with eight staterooms
adjoining. The furnishings are comfortable but not luxurious. The server
in the restaurant doubles as the stewardess for guests overnighting in
the inn, although concierge services are few.

**8. Administration/Traffic Control/Security Office/Sick Bay**
The formal headquarters of Belvedere Station, the admin office is a
confined, windowless, octagonal room with two desks and a trio of
holding cells built into the basement below. The desk to the left is used
for administrative purposes, with trade tables, ships' manifests and
station maintenance schedules onscreen. This computer also controls
the station's communications. To the right is the console used for traffic
control purposes, with screens displaying system maps at different
scales and with different approach vectors pre-plotted for common ship
types. Behind the administrative desk is a small arms locker, containing
the station's security weapons.

The holding cells and sick bay are accessed down a set of stairs. The
cells use simple metal bars, hinged doors and a mechanical but solid
lock. Sonic de-amplifiers are built into each cell to counter disruptive
guests but, like the rest of the station, the holding cells have never been
used. The room can be divided down the middle with a curtain and a
small auto-doc unit built over a fold-down operating table can turn the
room into an emergency sick bay if needed.

9. Crew Quarters
The crew quarters of Belvedere Station are accessed through a
nondescript door to the right of the office. This door is uninviting in the
extreme, a metallic grey that blends into the walls to the left and the
right. A small plaque at eye level reads 'Station Crew Only' and the door

only opens to individuals with a keyed badge. Beyond the door is a
short hallway. Five secured doors to the left open onto five staterooms
and a ladder leads down to another set of five staterooms below. Each
room is simply furnished to the taste of one of the station's occupants.

The end of the hall opens onto a small mess, kitchenette and common
room. Staff have reserved for themselves cabinet and freezer space
using passive-aggressive sticky notes.

A ladder is built into the wall in one corner of the mess, which leads
to a manual airlock above. Despite the signs reading 'Emergency
Exit Only', there is evidence of wear and scuffing that show this
to be a regular path of ingress and egress. On the exterior of the
station, the airlock leads to a ladder and accompanying tether-run
that goes along the spine of the fuel tanks and to the old hab, on the
opposite end of the station.

10. Fuel Tanks
Along with the tiny old habitation and maintenance complex, these
three megaton drums are the original orbital installation. They are
a simple structure: just the drums, welded together with extensive
scaffolding. Ladders run along the length of the scaffolding, allowing
maintenance to inspect individual elements for wear and tear from
cosmic radiation or micrometeoroid impacts. The old habitation complex
sits, dwarfed, at one end of the series of connected drums; the new
station is built on the opposite end. These two residential areas are only
connected by the external walkways, meaning that one would need to
spacewalk from the station to the hab, to get there.
11. Old Hab Complex
Belvedere Station is not a new installation. Prior to being refitted and
renamed it was officially known as the New Refuelling Depot or, more
colloquially, as 'the Tank'. Necessitated by the unstreamlined nature of
large, agricultural trade vessels, the Tank was supplied with unrefined
hydrogen by in-system ships running fuel from small-time, hydrogen
extraction enterprises at local gas giants. In those days, the Tank was
crewed by a single individual who resided at the station year-round in
a shielded hab complex, tool shed and maintenance shop that was
welded to the side of the depot. It remains intact and occupied, the hab
clean and the toolshop functional.

By most standards, the inside of the hab is ancient. The man who lived
in solitude here did so for 30 years before the station was refurbished
and he was not the first to occupy the space. Although the interior has
been kept impeccably clean and the electronics have been maintained
well past their expected lifespan, every year of wear shows on the
cosmetic surfaces. For example, any digits once engraved into the
control panels have been abraded away by decades of use, meaning
that it would be very difficult for anyone not intimately familiar with this

section of the station to operate its control panels. Likewise, the corners
of the table have been worn round and the ceramic plating on the floor
scuffed so much that the metallic mesh shows through.

For all its age, however, the hab has an incredible view due to three
out of four of its walls having large bay windows. Before the refit this
section of the station faced planetside but it has since been rotated
180 o outward to improve the planetary view from the tourist facilities. As
such, this small stateroom has clear line of site to New's moon, sun and
stars, as the station orbits the planet below.

POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENTS


A few developments or conditions are likely to make life interesting
aboard Belvedere Station.

Starport Review: Belvedere Station is expecting to undergo an
inspection of the highport by an IISS agent who is, as per spec,
conducting the review without identifying themselves. Some residents
of the station, including Jamison Clintock (deputy starport director)
and Fox Ocano (station mechanic) are vocally eager for the review
to be successful and for New to be reclassified as a Class C starport.
Independent business owners, such as T'chekra and the Bruglios,
likely want the venture to succeed because it will improve business,
although they are less vocal about their opinions, knowing that some
people are not so eager. Others, including Galvin Markov (the shuttle
pilot) openly wish for the review to fail, because they want New to
remain a quiet, rural place.

Locals versus Outsiders: Several residents of Belvedere are locals:
Jamison Clintock, Fox Ocano, Galvin Markov and Jo-Job the fuel
rat, although coming from different backgrounds. Fox and Galvin
both grew up on farms or ranches, like most locals, but Jamison is a
third-generation bureaucrat and has a formal education. Jo-Job does
not talk about his childhood or family. Some of the locals are friendly
towards outsiders, most notably Fox. Others are less friendly, especially
Galvin (because he does not like outsiders) and Jo-Job (because he
is socially awkward). Everyone else is from off-planet and has varying
perspectives on the backwater of New.

**Docked Agri-trader:** There is a reasonable chance that a bulk agri-trader is docked at the New highport at any given time. These ships
tend to run seasonal routes to maximise profits according to local
farming and ranching calendars, which although predictable, tend to
be very safe from piracy due to the bulk nature of the goods being
traded. As a result, the crews of these vessels tend to be more risk
averse and less technically skilled than other crews. When such a
ship is docked, it is likely that the station is a much more lively place
as spacers seek a little off-ship entertainment while their shuttle crews
load cargo from the planet below.

Criminal Organizations of the Marches
**By Gareth Hanrahan & Matthew Sprange**

The Spinward Marches is host to a multitude of organised crime, taking
advantage of the looser grip of the Imperium and other empires in this
region of space. The larger criminal groups are run like interstellar
corporations or government agencies, with staggering resources and
equally staggering goals.

MEMBERSHIP


A Traveller can choose to join one of the larger criminal organizations
when starting a new career as a Rogue. However, the Referee may
opt to allow other careers access to these organizations if this fits
with their campaign – after all, criminal organizations have a great
many people in their ranks with a massively diverse skill set. Other
careers that would fit in well could include Agent, Citizen, Entertainer,
Merchant and even Noble.

RANK


Once a Traveller joins a criminal organization they start at Rank 0 in the
career as normal. However, this also means they are at Rank 0 within
the criminal organization itself and will gain rank in the organization
whenever they do so in their career.

Gaining ranks in the criminal organization will bring additional bonuses
on top of those gained for the career alone.

There are, however, downsides in joining a large criminal organization.
As well as the expectation to be completely loyal, each organization
has its own requirements and restrictions that members must obey or
risk losing membership – or suffering a far worse fate.

RESTRICTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS


Restrictions are taboos for organization members, things they cannot
do. Common restrictions on criminal organization members include
revealing secrets of the organization to outsiders, or using the
organization's resources for their own private ends, but can also include
social restrictions, such as not harming people from a particular ethnic
group or avoiding a particular religious faith.

Requirements are things members must do. The most common
requirement is that the criminal pass on a cut of all ill-gotten gains to
the organization but other requirements include wearing a particular
uniform or behaving in a certain fashion.

BENEFITS


Benefits are passive boons granted by the organization – the
Traveller's membership in the organization helping them in some
fashion. One common benefit is protection; people know not to
cross the Traveller, as doing so will draw the wrath of the criminal
organization. Other common benefits include money laundering
facilities or easy access to illegal supplies.

The Vriterbei
The Vriterbei are a criminal syndicate active across the Spinward
Marches, similar to the Cosa Nostra organised crime gangs of Terra.

While the Vriterbei claim an ancient pedigree dating back to the First
Imperium, the first verifiable record of their activity is during the last
days of the Rule of Man. As the Second Imperium collapsed and
worlds became isolated from one another, new organizations and
structures rose up to replace the crumbling edifices of government
and commerce. The Vriterbei crime families thrived on failing worlds;
they had the resources to maintain order and commerce in places
abandoned by legitimate authorities. At their height, from roughly -300
to 300, the Vriterbei had considerable influence on dozens of worlds
across the Marches.

A concerted campaign against organised crime smashed the Vriterbei
network, driving them back underground. Where once they ruled whole
planets and controlled every aspect of interstellar commerce across
whole subsectors, they were reduced in a matter of decades to a
handful of bitter old men, lurking in dark rooms and muttering about the
good old days when they were gangster kings. The Vriterbei survived
as local crime syndicates on dozens of worlds; they might own a slum
neighborhood or a few front businesses but their power was only a
tiny fraction of past glories.

In the last century, a series of charismatic and ambitious Vriterbei
bosses have revitalised the old organization. Once again, strange
offworlders have visited old Vriterbei haunts and given recognition
symbols not seen in generations. The disparate cells of the old Vriterbei
network are slowly being shaken back into life and criminals who
never looked beyond the boundaries of their neighborhood are now
considering crime on an interstellar scale.

The strength of the Vriterbei is their cultural continuity. Analysts theorize
that the Vriterbei combine the criminal ethos and familial loyalty of the
Cosa Nostra with Vilani rigidity and tradition.

ACTIVITIES


Anything and everything; prostitution, loan sharking, gambling, protection
money, bribery, weapons smuggling and so on. The Vriterbei provide
whatever a planet needs. They sell arms to warlords, or slaves to bored
nobles, but also smuggle in food for starving peasants or invest in
legitimate companies. The Vriterbei want stability above all else.

REACH


The Vriterbei once had reach across the whole of the Spinward
Marches; today, they are mostly concentrated in District 268 and the
surrounding subsectors.

Restrictions
•  Do not speak of the Vritberei to outsiders.
•  Give one-quarter of your earnings to the Vritberei elders.
•  Never recruit a new member without the permission of your elders.
•  Anarchy is not our goal; do not rock the status quo.
•  Always be available to serve when called upon.

Requirements
•  Respect the Vritberei.
•  Teach your children and those you recruit the Vritberei ways.
•  Be respectful to the poor, to women and children.

**Benefits**
•  Vritberei members gain DM+2 to all SOC-based checks in
Vritberei territory.
•  Anyone killing a Vritberei member without permission will be
destroyed by the Vritberei.

Ine Givar
The history of the Ine Givar is a murky and contradictory one. Several
false histories have been deliberately circulated in the past, both by the
Ine Givar themselves and the Imperium. Conspiracy theories cluster
around the organization – some say they do not exist and that 'Ine Givar'
is just a convenient label the media use for any terrorist group. Others
claim they are funded by the Zhodani to destabilize the Imperium or that
the Imperium deliberately created an enemy to keep commoners in line
or that the Ine Givar is just a front for some other purpose.

The commonly accepted history of the Ine Givar traces them to the
Rhylanor subsector in the late 900s, that they were founded by a
disillusioned young noble who believed the Imperium was too lax in
tolerating corrupt or oppressive governments and who grew to blame
the entrenched politico-economic system as being more concerned with
propagating itself than improving life for Imperial citizens. The 'modern'
Ine Givar may have assimilated several other terrorist organizations.

ACTIVITIES


The ultimate goal of the Ine Givar is to overthrow the existing structure
of the Imperium and replace it with something more democratic; they
especially want the Imperium to intercede on troubled worlds where
disasters or corruption are endemic. Different Ine Givar cells have
different ways of advancing this ultimate goal, ranging from protests
or demonstrations to raise awareness of the Imperium's failings, to
kidnapping and extortion, to major terrorist attacks targeting the nobility,
symbols of Imperial power or lynchpins of interstellar trade networks.

REACH


Multiple sectors, although the heaviest presence is within the Spinward
Marches and Deneb sectors. The Ine Givar is not especially powerful or
wealthy but its ideals have been transmitted across hundreds of worlds.

Restrictions
•  Do not betray the Ine Givar, although even this restriction is a loose
one; an Ine Givar cell on one world might just shun a member who
leaked information to the authorities but on another planet the
same betrayal would merit a very painful death.

Requirements
•  Support the Ine Givar movement as best you can.

**Benefits**
•  Ine Givar members can expect help and shelter from other members.

```

The Syndicate
The Syndicate was formed by a group of retired adventurers and ex-criminals with access to a half-dozen free trader vessels and several
lifetimes of contacts and criminal suppliers. They had seen more of the
Imperium than any planetary crime lord and knew what was available
out there. They realised there was an opening for a specialized
organization of problem solvers, smugglers, assassins and weapons
dealers, a one-stop-shop for high tech criminal supplies – and they
provided it.

That was more than 70 years ago; the original Syndicate members
are mostly still alive, preserved by anagathics, but other investors and
crime lords have joined them on the board of the organization. The
Syndicate still offers criminal services for hire but has branched into
incorporating local crime organizations into an interstellar network.

ACTIVITIES


The Syndicate is the criminal equivalent of a business-to-business
service. They commit relatively few crimes themselves but instead
supply weapons, offworld travel, smuggling and so forth. The Syndicate
has been referred to as a 'shadow Imperium', as its influence usually
stops at the starport. They rarely bother dealing planetside.

The Syndicate's headquarters is rumored to be onboard a
converted luxury liner that moves along a pre-determined route on
the edge of the Imperium.

REACH


The Syndicate has hundreds of free traders and smugger ships in
the Marches.

Restrictions
•  Do not betray the Syndicate to the authorities, on penalty of spacing.
•  Members are not permitted to own more than Cr100000 worth of
property on any one planet.

Requirements
•  Syndicate members are obliged to give 10% of all earnings to
the Syndicate.

**Benefits**
•  Syndicate members will regularly be assigned jobs from clients.
Most of these jobs involve smuggling or other specialized criminal
tasks such as heists or kidnappings.
•  Syndicate members may obtain up to 10 Ship Shares for free; any
ship obtained with these shares is the property of the Syndicate.

Cult of the Traveller
The Cult of the Traveller is an underground organization, one that
has been heavily suppressed by virtually every government. The
cult stems from the teachings of a prophet (or madman) who called
himself the Watcher. He was a barbarian from a primitive lost world
who was taken to the stars by an IISS scouting mission in the mid-500s. The trauma of being lifted from an Iron Age society to the
Imperium shattered the barbarian's mind and he decided that he had
been taken into the realm of God.

How this delusion became a remarkably resilient religion is a mystery;
it is suggested that the initial prophet was a latent telepath who
somehow created a psychic imprint that still resonates, or that his
book of teachings has some unique resonance for the mentally ill.
Others suggest that an addictive combat drug called Tricerin or 'trick' is
responsible; it was widely abused in the 500s and still used to this day,
producing a psychotic state in which addicts are extremely suggestible.

The Cult's tenets are confused and there are many different sects, yet
they all share certain beliefs:
•  God created the universe but has now incarnated in human form.
Some say He has incarnated to find the faithful or to experience
the human condition. The most common manifestation of the Cult's
beliefs, however, is that God is trapped in human form and can
only be released through death.
•  Ritual murder is a form of communication or signalling to God, or
can point the way to God.
•  God may not know Himself. If you see God, you must prove to Him
that He is God and free him from His fleshy prison.
•  There are devils and demons who have also taken human form
and may pretend to be God. They must be slain.

ACTIVITIES


Proselytising and murder. The Cult has a number of high-functioning
sociopaths (produced through overuse of Tricerin) and funds its
activities through assassination and mercenary work.

REACH


Limited. Cells of the Cult exist on many different worlds but there is little or
no communication between them. A lone madman limps off a free trader
and disappears into a megacity; a year later, he has spread his twisted
philosophy to another dozen lunatics and the bodies start piling up.

Restrictions
•  Do not pollute your body with impure deeds or thoughts.
•  Do not listen to the blandishments of demons and sinners.

Requirements
•  Find God. When you find Him, cut Him out of His mortal body and
restore his divinity.

**Benefits**
Easy access to supplies of Tricerin.

Ranks
There are no ranks within the Cult and no resources it can draw upon.

```
TRICERIN


A drug of Darrian origin, Tricerin production was officially banned
in 772. However, the formula for the drug was already circulating
in the criminal underworld and it is comparatively cheap and easy
to produce. A Traveller who takes a dose of Tricerin gains the
following benefits.
•  DM+2 to Initiative checks
•  Reduce all damaged suffered by -2
•  DM+1 to attack rolls
•  DM+1 to Recon and Investigate checks due to added focus
```

```
A dose of Tricerin lasts for D3 hours. After this time, the Traveller
suffers DM-2 to all actions until they rest. Repeated use of Tricerin
causes hallucinations and psychosis.

Rabwhar is a minor TL7 agricultural world in the Lunion subsector.
A decade ago, Rabwhar's billion-strong population flirted briefly with
democracy. The existing hereditary monarch was the sort who puts the
'non-charismatic' in 'non-charismatic leader'; the harvests were failing
due to a blight imported from offworld and the plan to convert the planet's
Class D starport into Class B had been delayed by another 20 years.

A coup seized the capital city and surrounding territory, and held
it for nearly three weeks before the king abdicated in favor of his
considerably more popular niece. Public opinion turned against the
revolutionaries, the army closed in on the capital and the leaders of the
coup fled offworld. Rabwhar forgot about the Seventeen Day Democracy.

But the Seventeen Day Democracy did not forget about Rabwhar.
The Democratic Government-in-Exile still exists and claims to be the
legitimate government. To survive, they have gone underground (and
taken the contents of the Rabwhar Royal Bank with them).

ACTIVITIES


The Democratic Government-in-Exile of Rabwhar (DGER) has
mutated into a band of pirates and raiders. They spent the money
taken from Rabwhar on outfitting ships and hiring mercenaries; their
original plan was to return to Rabwhar in force and demand that the
new Queen resign and reinstate them. DGER has a pirate base in the
Shirene system and preys on shipping throughout Lunion, with special
emphasis on attacking vessels heading for Rabwhar.

DGER is an uneasy compromise between pirates and civil servants;
within a few years, it is almost certain that the pirates will win out and
abandon any pretension to legitimacy on Rabwhar or anywhere else.

Briefing File: Avastan
**By Geir Lanneskog**

Avastan (C433520-A, District 268, Spinward Marches), is a small cold
world with an unbreathably thin atmosphere and little liquid surface water.
Originally settled to provide an orbital starport along the Spinward Main,
Avastan's surface has been occupied by humans from surrounding
worlds for less than a century. As many settlers are refugees from
oppressive or troubled worlds, Avastan's citizens have built a free society,
open to anyone who homesteads the land, with a decentralised directly
democratic government and very few laws or regulations.

SYSTEM SUMMARY


Avastan's main sequence star, unofficially named Zend, is a stable
red dwarf with four gas giants, two planetoid belts and four other
major planets. Avastan is the second planet in orbit around Zend, lying
outward from Alpha, a warm small gas giant, and just beyond a stony
planetoid belt. Avastan orbits 0.162 AU from Zend, within the star's
jump shadow of 0.286 AU. The two planetoid belts and Gamma, the
planet beyond Avastan, have populations of a few hundred belters but
the overwhelming majority of the Avastan's 700,000 citizens reside on
the surface of Avastan. Rumors of pirate activity in Zend's planetoid
belts and outer system are common but not well-substantiated.

WORLD DATA


Avastan is an inhospitable world habitable only with the aid of a
respirator and cold weather clothing. The planet is tilted nearly 90
degrees on its axis, leaving its polar regions in daylight or night-time for half an Avastan year of 50 standard days. The extremes
of temperature during these long periods of light and dark, locally
referred to as 'Summerbright' and 'Winterdark', leave the polar
regions on average warmer than the equator. The Great Northern Sea
sits within the Northern Basin, an ancient 3,500-kilometer-wide crater
that sinks nearly five kilometers below mean surface altitude. This
provides a relatively warm region where some agriculture is possible
and where some well-acclimated humans can breathe unaided for a
limited period of time.

Gatha, a 320-kilometer-wide volcanic island in the center of the basin,
is home to Avastan Downport and 500,000 of Avastan's 700,000
citizens. Half of the remaining population lives within the basin, along
the sea's shore or in seasonal river valleys that flow into the sea.

Many of Avastan's citizens are refugees from the oppressive or war-torn worlds of Tarkine, Kuai Qing, Motmos and Singer, or migrants
from the industrial worlds of Collace and Forine looking for a better life.
Anyone who homesteads a plot of land on Avastan for one local year
can claim citizenship. The culturally diverse citizens of Avastan consist
of both a melting pot near the Downport and isolated enclaves with
distinct cultures, however all are united in support of the freedoms of
expression, property and self-defence, and of their aversion to all forms
of governmental restrictions.

GEOLOGIC HISTORY


Avastan formed with the rest of the Zend system approximately 6.85
billion years ago. A series of large impacts late in planetary formation
created both the depression that surrounds the Great Northern Sea and
the rough terrain that bounds the equatorial Lake District. One of these
impacts knocked Avastan completely on its side, leaving its axis of
rotation nearly parallel to its orbital track.

Avastan is a rather dry world, with most of its surface water the result
of asteroid or cometary impacts. Any original hydrosphere was likely
vapourised during Zend's unstable youthful phase, a period that
continued for more than four billion years. During much of this time,
Avastan had a thicker atmosphere of nitrogen and carbon dioxide.
Solar activity compounded by Avastan's weak magnetic field gradually
stripped nitrogen and water vapour from the atmosphere, cooling the
planet. Life and geologic activity eventually stripped much of Avastan's
carbon dioxide, accelerating the slide into arctic conditions.

Geological activity has mostly declined over the past billion years,
ending a period of plate tectonics and mountain-building. Hotspots
beneath the crust have continued volcanic activity and given rise to
large volcanic features such as Gatha Island in the Great Northern Sea
and the equatorial Atharsis Highlands opposite the Lake District.

Introduction of non-native life within the past million years have spiked
oxygen lives to nearly 30% of the atmosphere and have allowed the
colonization of the land by hardy native and non-native lifeforms,
altering patterns of erosion.

GEOGRAPHY


Land dominates the surface of Avastan, with water covering only 28.2%
of the surface. Of that percentage, two fifths are permanent glacier and
one fifth is permanent ice cap over liquid water. Only two fifths or 11.3%
of the surface is covered by water that is liquid and exposed to the
atmosphere for at least part of the year. The majority of this liquid water
is located in Great Northern Sea in the northern polar region and in the
briny smaller bodies of water inside the eroded craters of the equatorial
Lake District. The proximity of Avastan to Zend drives a strong solar
tide, reaching close to seven meters in the largest lakes. Tides in the
Great Northern Sea are not pronounced near solstice but can exceed
20 meters in some areas near the equinox, a period known as the
'Spring and Autumn Flooding'.

Most of the land area not covered in water or ice is cold desert
punctuated by eroding mountain chains and large areas of rough
terrain. Low levels of volcanic activity persist but are limited to hotspots
and scattered rifts where the crust has expanded on the borders of
these hotspots.

CLIMATE


Avastan is a cold world with average global temperature of -8° C but
the planet's varied geography and extreme axial tilt can cause large
variations in temperature. Polar regions experience the greatest
temperature extremes, sometimes approaching 30° C in the afternoon
of Summerbright in the Northern Basin and occasionally falling to less
than -70° C prior to dawn during Winterdark in the highland southern
polar region.

As with most worlds with extreme axial tilt, the poles have higher
average temperatures than the equatorial regions, although altitude
differences account for significant changes in temperature at a rate
of approximately 3° C per kilometer. Accordingly, Avastan Downport,
located on the island of Gatha near the center of the Great Northern
Sea at an altitude of 4,810 meters has a mean annual temperature
of 9.4° C and the agricultural regions on the far shore of the Great
Northern Sea have mean annual temperatures of 7.8° C. In the
equatorial Lake District, the warmest mean annual temperatures at the
lowest altitudes approach 0° C and, despite fairly constant conditions,
the region does not support surface agriculture.

The long Summerbright and Winterdark cycle results in significant
weather events in the polar regions, including late Summerbright
storms and cold ice fogs during Winterdark. The mid latitudes see the
most extreme weather, especially during equinoxes when the day and
night switch hemispheres, however the equatorial regions, especially
the Lake District are generally protected from severe weather events.
On the far side of the equator, the Atharsis Highlands form a barrier to
weather, with the dry 'ice shadow' shifting semi-annually to the summer
side of the world.

In general, the low atmospheric pressure limits the effects of storms,
with even hurricane-force winds too weak to topple a human or all
but the flimsiest structures. However, windblown snow and sand are
significant hazards to unprotected people and can penetrate or erode
weak structures.

The thin cold air and few bodies of open water limit precipitation outside
the Northern Basin area. Most of the world is a rugged frozen desert
ranging from tan to brown to red in colour.

BIOSPHERE CHARACTERISTICS


Native life on Avastan is primitive. Most of the planet's biomass consists
of single cell organisms whose few visible traces are limited to those
that form colonies, often appearing as mats or growths of black lichen-like crusts. Some simple multicellular organisms exist in the seas
and lakes of Avastan but most macroscopic surface life is non-native,

including significant biota apparently spread from Tarsus to Avastan by
panspermia and more recent imports to support small-scale agriculture
in the Northern Basin region.

EVOLUTION


Fossil evidence of life does not begin until 2.5 billion years before
present. The biochemistry of Avastan's lifeforms utilises l-chiral amino
acids and is compatible with [[Terra|Terran]] life but lacks some of the amino
acids necessary for human survival. Life in the seas and lakes of
Avastan eventually introduced oxygen into the atmosphere, forming a
thin ozone layer that allowed simple unicellular lifeforms to survive on
the surface and form colonies or mats of life that are most visible as
black 'crusts' on rockfaces.

Avastan's native lifeforms have only evolved into simple multicellular
forms with minimal differentiation, such as [[Terra|Terran]] sponges, although
some coral-like organisms with a polyp life stage have evolved in the
Great Northern Sea.

Approximately five million years ago, lifeforms bearing the biological
signature of neighboring Tarsus appeared on Avastan. Tarsus's star
was then significantly closer to Avastan's system, less than a quarter
parsec, leading the single published article on the subject to conclude
that the transfer of life was likely an example of panspermia of not just
unicellular organisms but spores and seeds or more advanced lifeforms
as well. Specifically, the Avastan fog flower and the Tarsus fog flower

- both small flowering plants with a long dormancy cycle that sprout in
the polar long spring and spread fog-like pollen – are clearly genetically
related, as are the ice moss species of both worlds, which grow quickly
in the light of summer and produce clouds of spores at the end of the
season. These obvious examples and several microscopic examples
of oxygen-producing photosynthetic organisms show a clear ancient
link between the two worlds and are likely responsible for the spike in
atmospheric oxygen that began in that timeframe.

FLORA AND FAUNA


Other than the black crusts and the tar-like black films that sometimes
cover stagnant bodies of water exposed to sunlight, Avastan's native
life is not noticeable to humans. The two most visible organisms are
transplants from Tarsus, likely predating human exploration or even
human evolution. The fog flower (nebelelifera avastanis) and the ice
moss (mastiri avastanis) are clearly locally adaptive relations of their
Tarsus counterparts and only exist in the Northern Basin. The Avastan
fog flower only sprouts once per year, within a local day of the solstice,
when the plant suddenly shoots up narrow stalks up to 30 centimeters
tall, sprouts yellow and orange flowers and releases pollen that combines
to spawn wing-like seeds. The grey-coloured Avastan ice moss grows
throughout Summerbright, reaching a height of five to ten centimeters
before releasing spores in the final days before the equinox.

Attempts to import other flora from Tarsus have met with limited
success and the thin atmosphere precludes the importation of any
significant fauna.

Other than a few sponge- and coral-like species in the seas, Avastan
has no native organisms categorised as 'fauna'. In the century
since settlement several invasive species have managed to thrive in
human-settled regions. The most obvious of these are the anthropoid
bed bugs that adapted to survive in human and Vargr communities
and the cockroaches that thrive everywhere humans have settled.
Certain species of these insects are able to survive in the low oxygen
environment of Avastan and have proven difficult to eradicate.

CULTURAL CHARACTERISTICS


Avastan has only been settled for the last century. Whilst Avastan
Portways, Inc. (API) is owner and operator of both the highport
and downport, the corporation has no control beyond the starport
boundaries. Over 700,000 people call Avastan home, drawn by the
prospect of free settlement and free government. The Avastan Charter
acts as a constitution for the world, guaranteeing homesteaders access
to land and enshrining freedoms of expression, property and self-defence. While weapons restrictions and permanent law enforcement
organizations do not exist on Avastan, citizen posse groups and local
assemblies prevent wanton destruction and open displays of weaponry.

By the tenets of the Charter, anyone who homesteads land on
Avastan for a local year is granted citizenship. Government is a direct
democracy of all citizens, regional governments founded and formed by
local citizens.

Many of Avastan's citizens are first or second-generation refugees from
the oppressive or war-torn worlds of Tarkine, Kuai Qing, Motmos and
Singer, or migrants from the industrial worlds of Collace and Forine.
While the majority of the population live in the northern polar region
of the world, near the starport and adjacent Zend City on the island of
Gatha, smaller settlements dot the far shores of the Great Northern Sea
and the more hospitable locations in the equatorial Lake District. Most
of Avastan's population is human but some Vargr citizens live in mixed
environments or small enclaves and a small contingent of Aslan of
Darrian origin has claimed homesteads in the Lake District.

Avastan's citizens are generally welcoming of diverse newcomers and
encourage homesteading to gain citizenship but despite a growing
reputation as a pirate haven, most citizens and API are strongly
opposed to the establishment of armed enclaves or of overt piracy
or militant behaviour that might trigger intervention by Imperial or
Trexalon forces.

HISTORY


Avastan is one of the last worlds to be colonized in District 268.
The inhospitable world or at least its star system was likely visited
during the Itzin Fleet's survey of the region in -1513 but no records
or artifacts of that visit are known. The first documented visit was a
cursory First Survey expedition in 352. The system and its worlds
received numeric designations and no follow-up surveys for at least
a century. The origin of the world's name is obscure, with reference
to Avastan, Zend and Gatha Island first appearing in a log entry
recorded during the Second Frontier War. The derivation of the names
is likely from the ancient [[Terra|Terran]] proto-Iranian language of Zoroaster,
Avestan, which is also referred to as Zend. Gatha appears to be a
reference to Zoroastrian hymns.

No permanent settlement is known to have existed in the system prior to
the 1005 establishment of Avastan Highport by Avastan Portways, Inc.,
originally a Collace-registered company, who hoped to gain revenue by
operating the only starport on the Spinward Main with repair facilities
between Tarsus and Wonstar. After the establishment of the port,
squatters from Collace and Tarkine, amongst other worlds, began to
settle on Gatha Island. After failed attempts to evict the squatters and
with no desire to develop the planet itself, API acknowledged the settlers
and turned over ownership and governance of the planet to its residents.
API placed few restrictions on this transfer, requiring only that the current
residents continue to allow open settlement and that they charge nothing
for the land. These original conditions and a framework for a free direct
democracy formed the basis of the Avastan Charter, agreed to by API
and the majority of the settlers in 1024. In the years since that transfer of
control, the population of Avastan has increased from less than 5,000 to
more than 700,000 and API has established a downport, which now lies
adjacent to Zend City, the only substantial city on Avastan.

After the establishment of Avastan Downport in 1027, the vast majority
of migrants settled, at least initially, on Gatha Island. Zend City grew
from a ramshackle startown to a sprawling, admittedly haphazard city.
Annual immigration rates measure in the thousands, increasing to near
current levels by the 1030s as political refugees from Motmos and
Tarkine began to arrive in larger numbers. With the Charter's guarantee
of no restrictions on political, social or religious practices, small
enclaves of like-minded individuals repressed or discriminated against
on their native worlds migrated from across the subsector and from as
far away as the Deneb sector, most establishing isolated enclaves in
the equatorial Lake District.

A less than scrupulous customs and registration enforcement policy by
API led to charges by Trexalon that the company was acting as a front,
or at least enabler, of piracy. Fearing Imperial intervention, Collace
responded by cancelling API's charter in 1061. However, the government
of Avastan issued API a new charter within 50 days of receiving the news
from Collace. Ownership interest in API did not substantially change and
even into the twelfth century, majority ownership of the company remains
in the hands of its original Collace financial backers, although most API
employees are now Avastan citizens.

Two current affairs issues remain open sources of disagreement on
Avastan. The arrival of Aslan migrants from the Darrian world of Roget
in the 1090s brought the first challenge to the Charter's insistence on
welcoming any migrant who chooses to call Avastan home. Although
homestead claims by these Aslan immigrants are no bigger than claims
by human or Vargr settlers, the fear of an ihatei invasion or a rapid
demographic increase of Aslan citizens has prompted three separate
referendum votes on limiting Aslan immigration. While the first two of
these measures garnered a majority vote, they failed to clear the hurdle of
three-quarters vote required to initiate a change to the Charter. The third

referendum only received the support of 40% of the electorate, indicative
of not only acceptance of the Aslan as citizens but of voter hostility to
repeated failed attempts to raise the issue and to the fact that only 8,500
Aslan have immigrated to Avastan, barely 1% of the total population.

The second issue dividing Avastan's people is the question of possible
terraformation of the world. An increase of oxygen and temperature
would greatly improve the planet's habitability. Unfortunately, an increase
in oxygen without a general increase of atmospheric pressure, would
result in a significant risk of uncontrolled fires and health issues related
to long-term exposure to a high oxygen mix atmosphere. Increasing
overall atmospheric pressure would alleviate this problem and achieve
the secondary goal of increasing the planet's temperature, however
this would also lead to an increase in glacial melt. The resulting rise
in the Great Northern Sea risks flooding for nearly 75% of the world's
population. As the question of atmosphere modification is not a
constitutional issue affecting the Charter, a vote to begin such a project
would require just a majority to pass. The measure to begin such a
project failed to garner more than 30% support but a second proposal to
allocate funds to perform a detailed feasibility and impact study narrowly
passed in 1103. The final report from this study is due in 1108.

SOCIETY


The freedoms enshrined in the Charter guarantee a free society and
limit the enforcement of societal norms. Combined with the status of
most Avastan citizens as immigrants or their children, the culture of
Avastan remains diverse and reflects many of the aspects that settlers
chose to bring from their old worlds.

The most obvious characteristics of Avastan's culture are a general
tolerance of private behaviour and respect for privacy. Ostentatious or
offensive public behaviour that could provoke a violent reaction is rare.
While outsiders would credit the unrestricted right to own weaponry with
this subdued behaviour, open display of weaponry is frowned upon and will
at the very least prompt a visit from a group of 'concerned citizens'. Violent
crime will result in a forceful response by an armed posse but individual
vigilantism is generally not tolerated, although there are exceptions.

Displays of cultures, religions and other traits that may not be shared by
the majority of the citizenry are considered perfectly acceptable as long
as they do not physically injure others or restrict the rights of others to
conduct their lives. Zend City is a melting pot, with both homogeneous
ethnic and racial neighborhoods, including a very colourful Vargrtown,
and with places where disparate groups live and work side-by-side.
Fusions of various cultures often occur and fads from one particular
subgroup may spread rapidly across Zend City's population, especially
among the native-born Avastanese.

The government provides very few services. Most infrastructure,
including utilities, roads, schools and hospitals, is created and
maintained by private entities, some for-profit but many operate as non-profits, cooperatives or charities. Article Twelve of the Avastan Charter,
however, guarantees the rights to breathe and to stay warm, with much
of the 3% value-added tax that comprises the bulk of the government's
funding going to maintaining basic sheltering services to those in need.

GOVERNMENT


The Avastan Charter forms the basis of Avastan's limited government.
Fairly rare among constitutional documents, the Charter begins by
listing what the government cannot do. It cannot charge for land, it
cannot deny entry to individuals, restrict the right to self-defence,
mandate cultural or religious preferences, agree to extradition treaties
with other governments, and it cannot take the life of its own citizens
for any reason. The Charter itself is difficult to modify. The amendment
process requires initial approval of 75% of registered citizens, followed
by a 'cooling off' period of one 50 standard day Avastan Year and a
second vote of approval by 75% of citizens the following local year.
The only amendment to the Charter since its signing was the provision
in 1061 to change the relationship between the people of Avastan
and Avastan Portways, Inc. The corporation is now an Avastan
chartered entity, subject to Avastan's laws, technically maintaining
extraterritoriality but under the jurisdiction of Avastan authorities.

The Charter describes the form of the central government and the manner
of elections and of the referenda required to pass all laws. The global
government's highest body is its 12-member Commission, comprised of
six commissioners chosen at large by popular vote – with the receivers of
the six highest vote tallies winning a seat – and six commissioners chosen
by lot from the world's citizenry. A randomly chosen commissioner may
designate a proxy or replacement but that proxy must never have served
as a commissioner. Commissioners serve for 10 local years and the
elected commissioners cannot serve consecutive terms. The three major
functions of the Commission, which meets only as necessary in a public
forum transmitted to all citizens, are to certify and codify referenda to be
put to a general vote, to serve as arbitrators of last appeal for disputes
between citizens and local governments, and to interpret and apply the
Charter, acting as a court of appeals to confirm or overturn local decisions
that relate to Charter provisions.

The commissioners also approve the world government's budget and
hire and dismiss officials necessary to implement the Articles of the
Charter and results of referenda.

A proposed referendum requires support of 10% of Avastan's citizens to
be put to a general vote or may be proposed by a three-quarters of the
commissioners if they deem it is of 'immediate planetary importance'. A
referendum is not considered passed unless it receives the support of

50% of the total citizenry. If it does not achieve that support within three
Avastan Years of its issuance by the Commission, the referendum is
withdrawn but may be resubmitted at any time.

All records of global government votes, decisions and associated
documentation is maintained in a distributed ledger spread among the
citizenry, stored at the highport and at an escrow office on an offworld
location. Prior to 1061, this offworld location was always the API home
office on Collace. The current location is in a vault of the Newland Bank
main branch on Tarsus.

Legal proceedings occur at the township level and penalties for crimes
focus on restitution, fines, forfeiture of property and exile from a
community. The right of Avastan citizens to remain on Avastan is enshrined
in the Charter, although non-citizens can be removed from the planet and
denied re-entry. Some townships provide for local incarceration, and a few
corporations offer incarceration as a service, but the majority of crimes –
even violent offenses – are resolved by restitution, not imprisonment.

Avastan lacks a formal permanent military force. API maintains security
forces at the highport and downport, equipped to local technology
levels. The only township with anti-ship defences is Zend City,
whose four double beam laser turrets and two double missile turrets
supplement Avastan Downport's defences.

ECONOMY


Avastan has few restrictions on trade or economic activity. Other than
a clear prohibition against slavery and indentured servitude in the
Charter, no economic activity is explicitly banned. Avastan has no local
currency, using the Imperial Credit as its common medium of exchange,
although local currencies from District 268, the Sword Worlds and
the Darrian Confederation are generally accepted at near exchange-rate parity. Merchants often add a surcharge for obscure or distant
currencies that prove difficult to exchange or properly valuate.

The global government charges a 3% value-added tax on all financial
transactions, although those involving cash transfers are often
unrecorded and untaxed. The Avastan Department of Revenue has
only seven staff investigators and penalties for non-compliance are only
a tripling of lost revenues and reimbursement of collection expenses.

The largest commercial entity on Avastan is Avastan Portways, Inc.
API employs 3,700 people but by local charter is not permitted to own
or operate businesses outside the highport and downport. No other
Avastan business employs more than 1,000 people, although some
larger townships operate as cooperatives or collectives, technically
employing the entire community.

SPECIAL PURCHASING CONSIDERATIONS


Outside Zend City, most items not directly needed for survival are
not likely to be locally stocked. Zend City is large enough to support
a complete marketplace of locally produced and imported goods and
a robust secondary market. Shopping from nearly any township or
homestead can proceed electronically without interference but shipping
to remote locations can be costly or time-consuming.

Nearly any consumer grade TL10 item capable of being printed by a
room-sized fabricator is available in Zend City with the exception of
fusion power plants, which must be imported. The standard cost of local
goods is assumed to include the 3% VAT.

IMPORTED GOODS


Larger items are generally special order, requiring communication,
shipping and authorization from the originating market. For high Tech
Level items, the Glisten Buyers Club (GBC) provides custom ordering
and shipping from Glisten, 10 parsecs distant. Such orders take a
minimum of 10 weeks and shipping costs and a 50–100% markup are
added to the cost of GBC orders.

All imports are subject to a 3% tariff, based on purchase price (but not
including direct shipping costs).

SECONDARY MARKETS


Second-hand markets, pawn shops and private sellers are not
prohibited from selling imported or military equipment but availability
and demand often do not coincide. Many items may simply be
unavailable at any price and prices can fluctuate wildly. The providence
of second-hand equipment is often checkered and quirks may apply.

The Wrong Patron

If a Traveller hangs around any starport bar long enough, some
shadowy patron may offer them a job purported to be quick, easy and
profitable. However, all too often unforeseen complications arise that
instead make the job time-consuming, difficult and sometimes costing
more than the Travellers get paid. Still, they are at least memorable...

Description: Serve drinks. Clean up drinks

Complications (1D):

1. Vargr. Drunk Vargr.
2. An old belter wanders into the bar and drunkenly tells the Travellers
    about a 'ghost ship' that jumps into the system on moonless nights.
    Well, not moonless nights, obviously. But only rarely. Anyway, it is a
    ghost ship. Really it is. He will even tell the Travellers where to find
    it if they give him another drink.
3. A prissy health inspector threatens to close the bar down. Actually
    cleaning the place is impossible – the dirt here is so old it is of
    archaeological significance – so the Travellers will need to find
    some other way of dealing with the problem.
4. 'Make me a Lunion Sunburst' demands the drunken noble. The bar
    computer has no record of such a cocktail. What do the Travellers do?
5. A corporation offers the Travellers a bonus if they can sell their new
    drink to the bar's clientele.
6. While in the bar, the Travellers overhear a shadowy patron offer a
    job to a group of Travellers. Do the Travellers try to steal someone
    else's plot hook?

CUSTOMS INSPECTORS


Skills Required: Electronics (sensors), Investigate, Recon
Patron: Customs Officer Cabreac
Reward: Cr700/week
Description: The starport is seeing a marked increase in traffic and
customs officials cannot cope with the number of ships coming through.
The Travellers will be employed to search ships for concealed cargo
spaces and contraband goods. Officially, they are supposed to call in
the actual bonded customs agents whenever a problem arises

Complications (1D):

1. A smuggler tries to bribe the Travellers, offering them Cr5000 if they
    report that her ship is clean.
2. As above but it is actually a test by Cabreac, to see if the Travellers
    are honest.
3. While the Travellers are on board a ship, they discover that the
    captain has left the security system offline. The Travellers could
    steal the ship with ease...
4. An organised crime syndicate targets one of the Travellers' Contacts,
    Allies or family members, planning to kidnap the target and use them
    as leverage to force the Travellers to let contraband through.
5. A freighter captain panics and jettisons his cargo in orbit while
    the Travellers are on board. Hundreds of tons of freight are now
    plummeting into the atmosphere. What do the Travellers do?
6. In the course of an inspection, the Travellers find something
    unusual on board – not illegal but very unusual or suspicious.

HOLOSHOW EXTRA


Skills Required: Art (performer), Deception
Patron: TLS Holotainment
Reward: Cr50/day plus lunch
Description: Many holoshows on border worlds are about spacers
and space travel. Space is exotic and exciting! Travellers can find
easy employment as a holoshow extra, lurking in the background of a
cantina or starport to make the place look strange and alien

Complications (1D):

1. The lead actor falls ill and one of the Travellers looks just like them.
    Congratulations, you have just been promoted!
2. The script for this holoadventure is riddled with factual errors. Do
    the Travellers bother to correct it or do they just grit their teeth
    and keep going?
3. The Travellers hear a rumor that the holoshow will be shooting
    several episodes offworld. If they can make their background extras
    into returning minor Travellers, they might be able to get a free
    passage offworld.
4. There is an action scene – and the lead actor is shot dead.
    Someone swapped the prop laser pistol for a real one. Who
    wanted the hero dead?
5. A journalist offers the Travellers a bribe if they spoil the plot of
    upcoming episodes.
6. The director quarrels with the writer and ends up throwing the script out.
    'You lot! You've been in space!' they shout, 'write me an adventure!'

LINER CREW


Skills Required: Diplomat, Mechanic, Steward
Patron: Cunard Starlines, LLC
Reward: Cr2500/month
Description: A massive starliner, the Grand Spinward, docks at the
starport. She is one of the biggest and most luxurious passenger liners
in the whole Imperium. Several of her stewards and other staff have
fallen ill, so the Travellers have an opportunity to work on board a
prestigious starliner

Complications (1D):

1. A band of Ine Givar terrorists attacks the ship, holding the rich
    passengers hostage.
2. The Travellers are assigned to serve one particularly troublesome
    passenger, a rich twit named Witerote Bores. He recently quarrelled
    with his manservant and is travelling alone, and has a habit of
    getting into amusing scrapes and confusing situations.
3. One of the passengers is targeted by an assassin, who plans to
    infiltrate the stewards.
4. Captain Esmith of the Grand Eastern is a tyrant who mistreats his
    crew. Do the Travellers stand up to his unreasonable demands?
5. The Travellers discover that the Grand Eastern is about to be
    scuttled for the insurance and that the engines have been rigged to
    fail at a critical moment, sending the ship sailing into the sun. There
    is no danger to the passengers, who can flee in lifeboats – but if the
    Travellers hide, they might be able to steal the whole liner!
6. The Grand Eastern misjumps and crashes on a jungle world. The
    Travellers and passengers need to survive until rescued.

MEDIEVAL TUTORS


Skills Required: Steward, Persuade, any Science
Patron: King Veremis
Reward: The local-currency equivalent of Cr200/week, plus room and
board in a castle
Description: The ruler of a primitive planet intends for his son, Prince
Veremar, to have the best possible start in life. To that end, he has hired
the best tutors his little kingdom can afford to teach the boy wisdom,
honor and science!

Complications (1D):

1. Prince Veremar is a spoiled brat who wants to spend all his time
    hunting, not learning.
2. The prince is regularly targeted by assassins; tutors are expected
    to double as bodyguards.
3. King Veremis is a good-hearted ruler but woefully incompetent.
    Viva la revolution!
4. The king intends for his son to oversee the modernization of the
    kingdom. Can the Travellers lay the groundwork for a jump from
    TL2 to TL8+ in a generation?
5. Prince Veremar dreams of seeing space and argues that he would learn
    best if he got to see a few other planets before settling down to rule.
6. Prince Veremar gets bored and throws his tutors into the dungeon.

ON SAFARI


Skills Required: Gun Combat, Steward, Survival
Patron: Marchesa Saddiv von Varren
Reward: Cr1000/week
Description: The Marchesa and her favorite rocket launcher are
going on safari. She needs a few strapping servants to herd the local
wildlife into her crosshairs

Complications (1D):

1. The Marchesa likes big animals. Saurians, specifically; they just
    look spiffing when mounted above the fireplace.
2. The safari draws unwelcome attention from the local population,
    who object to some crazed offworld noble landing with enough
    artillery to start a war.
3. A pirate targets the Marchesa's safari ship. On the downside, the
    pirate ship completely outguns the little safari ship. On the upside,
    as soon as the pirates open the airlock, it will be pirate hunting
    season for the Marchesa.
4. The Marchesa wants to bring the animals back alive. Work out a
    way to get that monster onto the ship.
5. Another noble is also on safari to this world. His expedition must
    be sabotaged!
6. The whole expedition is a cover for some other mission.

PROPHETS OF PEACE


Skills Required: Deception, Persuade
Patron: Taragun Vonter, Philanthropist
Reward: Cr5 per soul saved
Description: Vonter is an eccentric researcher – or madman – who
intends to remake the culture of an entire world. His target is a primitive,
war torn planet wracked by tribal conflicts and the method is religion.
He has developed a set of religious teachings that promote peaceful
trade and co-existence but needs salesmen to convince the tribesmen
to adopt these new ways. A few simple tricks like electric-light glows
and grav belt levitation should allow the Travellers to masquerade as
divine prophets...

Complications (1D):

1. There is an existing religion on the planet, a form of ancestor
    worship. Anyone defying the word of the ancestors is a demon and
    must be burnt at the stake.
2. One of the warring tribes agrees to convert to this new religion – if
    the Travellers provide 'divine weapons' to blast their foes.
3. Two tribes are suffering from disease; one has already converted,
    the other holds to the older religion. Which tribe do the Travellers
    supply with advanced antibiotics?
4. The Travellers hear of a young convert to their new faith who is
    demonstrating divine gifts. She is a naturally powerful psion but is
    preaching a strange version of their faith. How do they co-opt this
    young woman without her discovering the truth behind the religion?
5. Vonter is a psychohistorian, who is using this planet as a test
    subject. Once his experiment is done, he will move on, leaving the
    Travellers with a whole planet depending on them.
6. Vonter is a madman; he intends to set himself up as a god once the
    religion is established.

SALVAGE TEAM


Skills Required: Mechanic, Vacc Suit
Patron: Grendel Thorn, Scrapper
Reward: Cr500/week
Description: The wreck of an old 800-ton freighter, the Mirabel, is in
orbit. The jump drives and other key components have already been
stripped but there are still thousands of kilometers of fibre-optic cabling,
superconductive power cables, jump gridding, computer terminals and
other salvageable parts. The ship lacks life support, gravity and power;
here is a vacc suit and a crowbar, salvage what you can. Oh, the ship will
hit the atmosphere and start burning up in a few weeks

Complications (1D): The Mirabel has a secret...

1. The Mirabel was a former smuggler ship and there is still valuable
    cargo hidden in a concealed compartment. A band of smugglers
    knows this and intends to retrieve the cargo.
2. The Mirabel's jump drives were not removed and a random fluke
    in the ship's decaying power plant causes it to misjump with the
    salvage team on board.
3. One of the Mirabel's crew is still stowing away on board the
    wrecked ship. He is looking for some hidden treasure on board,
    such as a jump map to a rich asteroid belt or treasure cache. He is
    the ghost on board the ship.
4. There is a literal ghost on board – the psychic echo of a former crewman
    killed by pirates. Psionic Travellers may be influenced by this echo.
5. The Mirabel is not quite as badly wrecked as it first appears; patch
    the holes in the hull, fix the fried computer and fill up the hydrogen
    tanks, and you might be able to fly her again. Do the Travellers
    want to try stealing the wreck?
6. Grendel Thorn made a slight miscalculation when he plotted the
    Mirabel's orbit. The ship hits the atmosphere and begins re-entry
    with the Travellers on board...

STARPORT SECURITY


Skills Required: Investigate, Melee, Recon
Patron: Varo Moll, Starport Security Chief
Reward: Cr750/week
Description: The Travellers will patrol the starport, looking for trouble.
Their duties include dealing with rowdy drunks in the starport bar,
watching for pickpockets and petty thieves, patrolling the edge of the
port district and hangars, and generally keeping order

Complications (1D):

1. A gang of thieves intends to steal a ship from the starport hangars.
    The thieves' plan is to cut through the starport fence, start a fire
    near the hydrogen storage tanks and then break into the hangar
    while the guards are distracted by the blaze.
2. Weapons are banned in the starport bar for everyone – including
    security guards but there is a brawl involving a Vargr. Everyone else in
    the brawl is using fists and chairs; the Vargr's got lethal teeth and claws.
3. A local religious or political group starts protesting just outside
    the starport, complaining about the influence of offworlders. The
    planetary government supports their right to protest but the starport
    wants them gone. How do the Travellers deal with this?
4. A starship carrying refugees from a war-torn world arrives. The
    starport authorities need the Travellers to keep order until they can
    process their applications for sanctuary. How do the Travellers deal
    with hundreds of terrified, sick and starving people?
5. A scout ship arrives in orbit and is brought to the starport. The lone
    scout on board is in a coma; something poisoned her and she
    obviously barely escaped with his life. What if that same danger is
    now loose on the starport?
6. A smuggler band is using the starport to fence goods. They offer to
    cut the Travellers in on the action if they 'overlook' a few shipments.

TAS STRINGERS


Skills Required: Art (write), Electronics (comms), Investigate
Patron: The Traveller's Aid Society
Reward: Cr5000/article
Description: The Journal of the Travellers' Aid Society is one of the most
respected and widely-read publications in the Imperium. Assembled from
the reports of TAS members and journalists, JTAS prides itself on being
an indispensable guide to known space. Lately, however, the editors
have seen few reports from this subsector, so they intend to hire a few
amateur stringers to file reports from the worlds they visit

Complications (1D):

1. JTAS has seen few reports from this subsector because of an
    official news blackout. The Imperial Navy has discovered something
    unusual and the x-boat network has been ordered not to carry
    information out of the subsector.
2. A corporation approaches the Travellers, offering them a bribe
    if they will report favorably on the corporation's increasingly
    disastrous effort to terraform a border world. The corporation is
    trying to attract settlers to the planet.
3. JTAS sends the Travellers a packet of tickets for bizarre tourist
    attractions across the subsector; they need to review attractions
    like the Sector's Largest Ball of Monofilament Wire or the birthplace
    of some long-forgotten grand duke, where the duke's brain is kept
    in storage and rubbed for good luck.
4. A pirate band targets the Travellers, planning to force them to
    write articles that will attract vulnerable passenger traffic to an out-
    of-the-way system.
5. The government of a world in this subsector took offence at a
    JTAS article and has dispatched agents to assassinate any JTAS
    journalists they find.
6. A recent JTAS article filed by another stringer contained military
    secrets. The Travellers are suspected of having access to secret
    information and shadowy figures start spying on them to learn how
    they breached security. The only way they can clear their name is
    by finding the other journalist.

TTAASS



**TRAVELLERS AID SOCIETY**

WASTELAND SCAVENGERS


Skills Required: Gun Combat, Recon
Patron: Jahanum Archaeological Society
Reward: Cr5000/week
Description: The Travellers are hired to visit a ruined planet.
Civilization collapsed here a century ago, wiped out in a cataclysmic
nuclear war. There are only a handful of survivors in the bombed-out
ruins of the cities. The whole planet is under Imperial interdiction but
the Jahanum Archaeological Society want to recover artefacts and
records that reveal the history of the dying world. The Travellers will be
smuggled past Imperial lines, dropped in the wilderness and given a
few weeks to scavenge what they can before pick-up

Complications (1D):

1. Radiation levels on the planet are extremely high; HEV suits are
    needed if the Travellers are to survive.
2. The planet is under interdiction not because of the dangerous
    environment but because of a doomsday weapon left over from war.
3. The war is still being fought; the two sides both have deeply buried
    bunkers and armored warriors emerge from these underground
    fortresses to fight for a few square kilometers of scorched earth.
4. The Jahanum Archaeological Society is specifically interested in
    recreating the events that led up to the war, such as recordings
    made inside the office of the President of the Union.
5. Fallout from the nuclear war has mutated survivors into crazed predators.
6. The Jahanum Archaeological Society is a cover for Imperial
    Intelligence; there is evidence that the war was deliberately
    triggered by an alien empire and they want to know who caused a
    once-peaceful world to descend into nuclear war so easily.

WHALE HERDERS


Skills Required: Animals (handling), Seafarer (submarine), Survival
Patron: Third-son-of-second-daughter-of-fourth-son-of-first-daughter-of-wavebreaker
Reward: Cr500/week
Description: The Travellers are hired by a Dolphin noble from a water
world. He claims a huge section of the ocean as his domain, where he
farms the local megafauna (whale-sized fish-like creatures). He needs
some ranch-hands to do some undersea work

Complications (1D):

1. The Dolphin noble is something of an aberration on his world; most
    of the other cetaceans have no interest in the Imperium and do not
    want to see industrial fish farming on their waterworld.
2. The megafish are being harvested not just for their meat but for
    their bones that contain valuable minerals. There are legends of a
    'megafish graveyard' somewhere in the depths. Find that and you
    are set for life.
3. The Dolphin intends to sink an old starship in the middle of his
    domain; the starship is still functional, merely outdated. It can still
    serve as a ready-made airtight structure. Who wants to volunteer to
    crash a 20,000-ton starship into the water?
4. A native race of primitive humanoids hunts the megafauna. The
    noble's plan would rob them of their hunting grounds.
5. Someone is stealing megafish from the noble's domain. The
    Travellers need to stop these rustlers and find out how they are
    abducting the giant creatures.
6. Megafish implies megasharks.
