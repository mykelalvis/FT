# Fated Travels

## The Pitch

[Traveller](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Main_Page) but for [[Fate Core]]

For the unfamiliar, Traveller is a space-opera setting.  Don't bring your PhD in physics to the table.  It'll make you sad.


## The [Scope](https://fate-srd.com/fate-space-toolkit/creating-fate-space-game#defining-the-setting)

### The Tone

The tone will _probably_ tend more towards personal stories, but it's essentially Traveller so the distances and differences are pretty epic.  There will be a general need for funding the lives of the characters, maintaining any possessions they have, and dealing with their expenses. 

### The Period

The setting is [[Third Imperium]].  The source books are specifically those from Mongoose that I own, but even the PDFs of those are $30-$50, so I don't own all of them.  

The start date is probably around 1103.  We will settle on campaign [[Aspects (FST)]] during character creation.  This is a relatively stable time, with various forms of growth, research, exploration, and commerce being primary themes.

### The Extent

The extent of the system will be [[Charted Space]] and maybe somewhat beyond.  The characters will start in the [[Core Worlds]], but could end up literally anywhere (probably the [[Spinward Marches]])

### The Characters

## Player Requirements

1. You need to be at least 18 years old, or at least 15 and accompanied each time by a custodial adult who is willing to keep you up late on a school night.  I don't run games with extreme adult themes, but it's Traveller and there tends to be quite a bit of violence and occasionally situations that require at least a degree of maturity.
2. While this remains somewhat casual, you will be expected to make the scheduled times with reasonable consistency.  2nd and 4th Sundays, 6:30 to ~10:30 (maybe earlier)


## Rulings and Parameters

1. Characters must be [[Traveller]]s.  It's in the name.  They can't be specifically tied to a location or a position that forces/implies a location.  They are the sort of person who exhibits at least a bit of wanderlust.  It's simply in their nature.  They can have friends and family, but should expect to be months or years away from them at some point.
2. Character creation will be on the Discord server starting today and ending next Saturday ([[2024-03-09]])
3. The first round will be a round-robin of people choosing their apex (+4) skills.  You'll need to select this soon.  This keeps the party from being too lopsided.  Once everyone has done that, we'll continue with everyone's +3 skills.  After that, it'll be a free-for-all.
4. _If anyone needs it_, (or just wants to try it), character creation will [attempt to] utilize the [Backstory Cards](https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/publisher/3019/galileo-games/category/34739/backstory-cards) as an aid to getting characters developed a bit faster.  I have a set of these.  We'll see how that goes.
5. Characters can be from any existing service (or none).  Actual military service is not required, but the [[Third Imperium]] is a dangerous place.  Also, space travel is a dangerous thing.
6. If you don't have a skill that can get you paid, you'll probably want a [[FTSkills#Profession]].
7. Fate is [usually] a very cooperative game.  Given the relatively dangerous nature of the Traveller universe, I strongly encourage helping each other rather than not.
8. Age is just a number, and age isn't the problem that it is in regular Traveller.  You aren't trading your entire youth for 4 skills.  Characters are built on [[Fate Core]] , so they're very competent and aging probably won't initially be an issue.
9. [Characters](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/your-character-idea) will start with 5 Aspects,: 1 [[high concept]], 1 [[trouble]], 1  _service-specific_ aspect, 1 _relationship_ aspect (with another character), and 1 general [[aspect]].
      A relation aspect is one that is somehow related to another character.  A service-specific aspect is, as the name on the tin says, an aspect related to one's former service.
10. Characters will start with 4 [[Stunts (FST)]], 2 gear points, and 3 [[Refresh (FST)]].
	1. During certain Storypath actions (I'm not going tell which), the character might get an additional point for a stunt.
	2. Like TEQ, players who attend the first 4 active sessions will receive a bonus [[Refresh (FST)]] point (that's a Very Big Dealâ„¢, in case you didn't know).  Unlike TEQ, this refresh **must** be used to improve a skill, buy a stunt, or acquire gear points.
	3. Players who attend all of the first 8 sessions (assuming we continue to play) will likewise receive a bonus refresh point (same restrictions).  
	4. Bonus refresh is in addition/separate from actual character advancement rewards.
	5. You may burn a [[Refresh (FST)]], or possibly two, on a stunt or on 2 gear points.
11. The game will have several [[Extras]].  Specifically, there's a separate [[FTSkills|skills sheet]], that includes two entirely entries:
	1. The game will use both [Extreme Effort and Collateral Consequences](https://fate-srd.com/fate-system-toolkit/consequences#alternate-uses-for-consequences) rules.  There must be an accompanying narrative reasoning for the damage.
	2. Fated Travels will use the "Gear" rules from Bulldogs and the Fate Codex [Ammo Track](https://fate-srd.com/fate-codex/lock-and-load-using-ammo-fate#the-ammo-track)
	3. The [Discover Action](https://fate-srd.com/fate-codex/actions-intent-discover-fate-core) will be used. [[Actions as Intent - Discover in Fate Core#The Discover Action|The Discover Action]]
	4. [[Resources]] is not a skill in [[Fated Travels]].  Sorry.  You can't be auto-rich and you can't really start off rich.  However, there IS a wealth track per Bulldogs' "credit track"; as stated, you start pretty poor.  [[Social Standing]], certain aspects, and occasionally backstory events might increase your credit track.<br/>The attached [[Gear]] document is included as a reference, not precisely how we will do things.  
	5. The [Refresh Tools](https://fate-srd.com/fate-system-toolkit/refresh) will be used, allowing flashbacks, recovery, and reflection scenes. 
	6. [Supplemental Actions](https://fate-srd.com/fate-system-toolkit/supplemental-actions) will be used.
	7. [[Social Standing]] - A new "skill", because Traveller.  It has a stress track, because of course it does. 
	8. [[Psionics]] - because Traveller; note that this gets expensive really fast and starts off pretty weak.
	9. [[Fated Travels]] has a specific [[FTSkills|skill tree]].
	10. [[Jump Drive Travel]] in [[Fated Travels]] has a mentally-damaging side-effect called [[Jump Sickness]], so starship pilots (and conscious crew) need reasonably high [[Will]] or a lot of therapy/drugs.  In short, being conscious during Jump travel executes a mental stress attack based on the jump distance travelled.  The timeframe is still 1 week, regardless of jump length.
	11. Starships will have aspects, skills, and stunts, per the Bronze Rule.
	12. Traveller has reactionless maneuver drives and general artificial gravity (on ships).  It's part of the conceit of the game.  Again, don't bring your physics degree...
	13. We will use the [Character skills modify ship skills](https://fate-srd.com/fate-space-toolkit/statting-spaceships#character-skills-modify-ship-skills) toolkit
	14. Space combat will be a combination of [[Disapora]]-style combat and medium-to-low plausibility [[Fate Space Toolkit]] + Bulldogs combat.
		1. [[Pilot]] is the default evasion skill for physical attacks
		2. [[FTSkills#Gunnery (Ship's Weapons)|Gunnery]]  is the default ship-based attack skill, with [[FTSkills#Remote Operations|remote operator]]  being a drone pilot.
12. We will use the [Fate Achievement Checklist](https://fate-srd.com/downloads/Fate-Achievements.pdf) for the first few rounds of character-specific milestones.  This is meant to promote understanding of "how Fate works".
13. "Mustering out benefits", one of the seminal elements of Classic Traveller, isn't precisely a thing here.  
	1. Ending 16 years of service with Cr10,000 and a gun has always seemed dumb to me.
	2. Backstory cards allow for some flexibility in this area, as they have results that could be such things
	3. If there's something specific that the character should have beyond what's expected, refresh can be used to pay for it.
	4. You get some gear points, so that should help a bit.
