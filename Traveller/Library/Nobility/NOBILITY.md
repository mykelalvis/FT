# THE NOBILITY

There are three ways to become a member of the Imperial nobility. The first is simply the passage of noble patent through heredity, the second comes from something good happening – an honor grant – and the third implies that something bad has occurred, resulting in revocation of title and subsequent reinstatement or reassignment.

The most common passage of noble title occurs through heredity. While there are no assurances that the offspring of an effective and honorable noble will serve with the same level of distinction, hereditary passage of title provides stability, especially given the immense breadth of the Imperium. Noble titles are usually passed on to the firstborn heir, sometimes with preference for the firstborn male or female but there are no rules that govern this and nobles may ultimately decide for themselves whom among their heirs receives the patent. Many nobles have more than one title and liberally distribute them among their heirs, which can cause discord if there are no established rules of heredity in place.

Honor nobles are given their titles as a reward for achievements, including military victories, success in business or accomplishments in academia. Titles for honor nobles include knight, baronet, baron and, on rare occasions, marquis. Noble patents for knights, barons and marquises are granted by the Emperor but baronets are traditionally granted only by archdukes. Noble patents are granted twice per year, once on Holiday (the first day of the year) and again on the Emperor's birthday. Most honor patents do not lead to enfeoffment (land acquisition). The title of marquis is an exception as it typically includes a fief but landless marquises are not unknown. When a fief is not immediately granted, a marquis patent typically implies that one may follow. Indeed, a march – the name of a land grant given to a marquis – is often dangled as an enticement for further good service.

Bad behaviour among the peerage is not unknown and can result in the suspension or revocation of a noble patent by [[Emperor Strephon Aella Alkhalikoi|the Emperor]] or [[the Moot]]. However, for the sake of stability, wayward nobles or at least their heirs are often reinstated later. Although nobles swear fealty and a pledge of honor to [[Emperor Strephon Aella Alkhalikoi|the Emperor]], transgressions do occur from time-to-time; treason, kidnapping, extortion and other crimes are common cause for patent revocation. The Imperial feudal system is intended to prevent such things from happening but not every archduke watches their dukes like a hawk, nor does every duke keep a close eye on their counts and so forth. The temptation to defy Imperial law or the dictates of one's superiors is apparently too great to resist for some among the noble ranks. There are times when such resistance is justified. For example, a count may refuse to follow the orders of an incompetent duke and actually pursue the revocation of his superior through various channels. History has shown that such bids are rarely successful unless incontrovertible evidence of incompetence or other malfeasance is provided. The system favors hierarchical order and stability and [[the Moot]] does not tolerate insubordination lightly.

The highest rate of revocation is at the knight level but all manner of titles have been stripped including that of duke. Revocation is not levied lightly and often preceded by a suspension, especially when a lesser violation has occurred. Suspensions can last years or even decades, depending on the seriousness of the infraction and follows when the noble in question refuses to make amends or shows no remorse for the actions that caused the suspension. A contrite noble can usually get their title back at [[Emperor Strephon Aella Alkhalikoi|the Emperor]]'s mercy. Even if there is a lack of contrition on the part of the offender, if the remainder of their family continues to serve the Imperium in good will, reinstatement often follows and the patent is reassigned to a more cooperative member of the family. This is most likely to occur when the family in question has a great deal of power. For example, it is difficult for [[Emperor Strephon Aella Alkhalikoi|the Emperor]] to deny a family that also chairs a megacorporation or has flag-rank naval officers.

There are times when the revoked noble and their family are so steeped in corruption or dishonor that [[Emperor Strephon Aella Alkhalikoi|the Emperor]] or [[the Moot]] has no choice but to permanently revoke the patent. In this case, the patent is reassigned to a noble of the next tier, resulting in a promotion to the vacant rank. While this is rare, when it does happen, contention for the patent can be quite fierce and the Imperial Navy may be called upon to ensure a peaceful transition of power.

In addition to the more formal appellations listed above, 'Your Grace' or 'Your Majesty' may be used in reference to nobles ranked Baron or above. For Knights, simply 'My Lord' or 'Madam' will suffice.

It should be noted that the Imperium is a vast place and there is a great deal of variation among its worlds. In some societies, noble titles may be conflated to convey immense importance (for example, 'Your Most Illustrious and Accomplished Eminence') while on more egalitarian worlds, such appellations are often done away with altogether. Variety is the spice of life and Travellers are likely to encounter many different situations when it comes to the nobility and their acceptance – or lack thereof – by the worlds over which they preside.

[[Emperor Strephon Aella Alkhalikoi|The Emperor]] may award noble patents of all ranks but those ranked marquis and above are members of the peerage and may only receive a patent from the Emperor. Knights and baronets may be granted patents by archdukes but only within their domains. This enables the archdukes to build allegiances within their domains without the aid of the Emperor.
