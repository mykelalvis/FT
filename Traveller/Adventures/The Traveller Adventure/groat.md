Herbivore native to [[Fulacin]] in the [[Rhylanor Subsector]]. Individual groats are harmless, but the outer members of a herd will attack 'any perceived danger in groups.

Groats have been transplanted to several worlds in the [[Aramis subsector]], most notably [[Focaline]].

## Groatle

The groat's shaggy hair (known as groatle) is the most obvious resource it provides. Once sheared, cleaned, and groomed, it has a softness and silkiness rivalling the finest synthetic. In addition, groatle contains a high concentration of metal salts, which has two beneficial effects. First, groatlev cloth is proof against most llfeforms which eat other animal fibers (such as various species of [[Terra|Terran]] rnoths). Second. a simple chemical treatment brings out an iridescent, shimmering quality which is very attractive. 

## Food
Greats are also raised for their meat, which is highly prized by [[Vargr]].
