##### DAMAGE CONTROL OPERATIONS

```
The absolute priority in any damage control operation is save the ship.
Under most conditions the situation is not so serious that crewmates
have to be left to die in order to save the majority but vessels have been
lost due to the good intentions of personnel who put saving lives ahead
of their first duty.
```

```
Ships can become damaged in many ways. Collisions with objects or
other craft, malfunctions, fires, sabotage and enemy action all tend to
cause differing kinds of damage. Even careless cargo stowage can
result in containers shifting and damaging the vessel; although rare this
has significant results, a cascading cargo shift under conditions of rapid
manoeuvring can wreck a ship from the inside.
```

```
With so many possible ways to come to harm, it is small wonder that
starships are expected to have effective damage control procedures in
place. Vessels belonging to large merchant lines or military organizations
run drills on a regular basis, even detaching personnel to attend seminars
or receive advanced training. Other vessels must make do as best they
can, although commercial training courses are available for those who
feel the need to be a little better prepared.
```

```
There is a big difference between damage control and repairs, yet it is
one some crews fail to comprehend. Repairs restore a ship to normal
working order; damage control is about retaining enough functionality
to survive the immediate situation. Sometimes it is necessary to take
actions that will make later repairs more difficult and expensive in order to
solve a problem and move on to something else. Those who succumb to
the temptation to stick around and make a good job of one compartment
may be overwhelmed by the uncontrolled disaster erupting from the next.
```

```
RULE CHANGES
These rules are intended to replace the Repair System action on Page
161 of the Traveller Core Rulebook and provide for additional damage
effects in combat or amidst disaster.
```

```
CASCADING HULL FAILURE
Under the starship combat rules, each time a vessel takes 10% of its Hull
score in damage it suffers a critical hit. This rule remains in place but in
addition each time a 10% damage threshold is passed there is a chance
the hull will begin to fail. The chance is a 12+ on 2D, with DM+1 for
```

```
3
```

every 10% of hull damage the ship has already lost. A failing hull suffers
additional damage each round of space combat, at the rate of 1D Hull
per 100 tons of vessel.

For example, a 400-ton vessel with 160 Hull has already taken 32 points
of damage when another hit inflicts 19 more. Total hull damage is now 51
and the vessel has passed another threshold. If the Referee rolls 12+ on
2D (with DM+2 for damage already existing) the hull will begin to fail. The
ship will suffer 4D additional Hull loss per round until she comes apart.

A cascading hull failure may halt on its own if some particularly rugged
internal component holds the vessel together. On a straight roll of 12 on
2D, no further damage occurs. Hull failure may be halted by a successful
damage control action.

ADDITIONAL DAMAGE EFFECTS

Whenever a ship or craft takes damage there is a chance of additional
damage effects. These can be used to add drama and tension to a battle
(if any more is needed); they range from inconvenient to life-threatening.
These additional effects are less crippling to a ship’s systems than critical
hits but may still need to be dealt with by the crew if they are to continue
functioning effectively.

Additional damage effects can be secondary, such as a buckled hatch
some distance from where damage occurred, due to tremors or shearing
forces through the hull. However, they should be logical. A fire that
breaks out at the other end of a ship from damage caused by a shifting
cargo container requires some creative explanation; wherever possible
the Referee should choose a suitable hazard and location based upon
what is currently happening to or aboard the ship.

Location
The general location of damage may be determined by in-game events;
a chemical spill in the hold will cause damage effects nearby, for
example. However, sometimes random locations are required. A ship hit
by weapons fire or suffering damage from atmospheric buffeting could
have problems almost anywhere. If this is the case, roll 2D.

```
2D Location
2-4 Control and Electronics Areas (bridge, electronics bays, computer
rooms, sensor systems)
5-9 Living, Working and Cargo Areas (holds, staterooms, common areas,
fuel tanks, stowage)
10-12 Power and Drive Areas (drive rooms, workshops and adjoining areas)
```

4

```
The Referee should decide on a specific area such as a group of
staterooms or the drive chamber access corridor.
```

```
Severity
Additional effects are usually not very severe but can escalate if left
unattended. If random determination is required, roll 2D.
```

```
2D Severity
2-4 Trivial. The problem is largely cosmetic and can be ignored for the
time being.
5-7 Minor. The problem is not likely to escalate or be life-threatening but
may cause a nuisance.
8-10 Serious. The problem needs to be dealt with or it will escalate into a
life-threatening situation.
11-12 Severe. The problem is already out of hand and getting worse.
```

```
Note that the Travellers might not realise how serious a problem is. A
failing bulkhead might currently have a trivial air leak but if left alone this
could escalate into explosive depressurization of the compartment. Thus
Travellers will need to make checks and deal with problems – or just
hope they are not too serious.
```

```
Nature
Sometimes the nature of a problem will be obvious from how it was
caused; a ship that has just collided with a rock face is likely to have
structural issues rather than a computer glitch, although being banged
around is not good for any shipboard system. If random determination is
required, roll 2D.
```

```
2D Nature
2-3 Electronic system
4-5 Fire
6-7 General chaos but no critical systems in danger
8-9 Structure
10-11 Air or water leak
12 Major System – roll as if a Critical Hit had been received, applying
the additional damage to the indicated system.
```

```
Electronic Systems might be big or small. A ship has many subsystems,
some unrelated to critical functions but inconvenient. For example, an
additional damage effect might disable the climate control system for a
part of the ship, making it too hot or cold, or taking out the artificial gravity.
```

```
5
```

Fires can be started in a variety of ways. Overloaded electrical systems
or jammed motors can generate sufficient heat to ignite combustible
materials; some compounds used or carried as cargo aboard starships are
highly flammable and may be ignited by sparks or – if they are extremely
unstable – simply being jarred around during violent manoeuvring.

General Chaos is a catch-all term for a situation where lockers are
sprung open, small items are flung around and breakables are broken. It
may just look bad or can conceal something serious.

Structure implies there is a structural component problem. This might be
a jammed hatch or warped corridor flooring; not too serious in itself but
capable of interfering with shipboard operations.

Air or Water Leak could be internal or external. An internal water leak
might be nothing more than a burst pipe causing water to slosh about
the corridors; a more serious version of the same problem might have
the ship venting life-support water reserves or dumping them into an
occupied compartment. Likewise, a small air leak might be nothing to
worry about even if it is external but a crew who knows that the seals on
the drive room are leaking might become nervous just in case a more
serious problem requires no-longer-airtight doors to be closed.

6

```
Major System effects are essentially secondary problems applied to
systems indicated by the critical hit table. This can be a real problem –
even a small fire on the bridge is unwelcome and it is possible a critical
compartment may have to evacuated at an inopportune moment.
```

```
The Referee should play the additional damage effects for drama and
tension. Amid the chaos of a space battle, the depressurization alarms
start sounding, with the damage board indicating an air leak of unknown
severity in the crew common area. The galley is trashed, with the contents
of every locker and cupboard strewn around and blowing in wind caused
by the air leak. There is a fire in the aft electronics-systems room, the
bridge bulkhead has warped and the hatch is jammed, and nobody really
knows how serious any of it is...
```

```
DAMAGE REPORTING
Most ships have a ‘damage board’, of some kind. On military ships this a
sophisticated display capable of showing the big picture or zooming in on
specific problems, giving an indication of severity, likelihood of escalation
and the recommended actions to be taken. Civilian ships usually have a
less complex version and some have no damage reporting capability at
all. The level of internal monitoring and damage reporting is dependent
upon the ship’s sensor suite.
```

```
Basic: A vessel with only basic sensors has a number of independent
internal sensors that can detect changes in air pressure and temperature,
the presence of smoke or airborne chemicals and abnormally high
or low power loads. Sensors are also fitted to critical hatchways and
access points indicating whether they are operable or not. Information is
reported by way of alarms and screens on the bridge and in engineering.
A basic system does nothing more than tell the crew air is rushing out
of a particular compartment and the hatch to it is inoperable in the open
position. They must infer from this data what the problem might be and
determine a course of action. Basic sensors give no bonus to damage
control operations.
```

```
Civilian: A vessel with civilian sensors has an integrated damage reporting
capability including more sophisticated sensors and the systems to use
them. Hull stress is incorporated into the data, along with an estimate
of the severity of any given problem. Basic sensors will tell the crew
there is smoke in a compartment and the temperature is rising – and
will sound the fire alarm – but civilian sensors will indicate the location
of hotspots and draw the attention of the crew to the fact that a nearby
bulkhead is being warped. The damage control display also indicates
what is near to the danger point and the chance of it being affected. Thus
if there is a major power junction in a leaking compartment the system
will highlight this but suggest that pressure loss is not likely to affect the
junction’s operation. However, this function is limited – civilian sensors
```

```
7
```

do not create a detailed predictive model; they merely show what is in
the area and if it is likely to be affected by the problem presumed to be in
effect. Civilian sensors give DM+1 to checks related to damage control
but not repairs.

Military: A vessel with military sensors has a sophisticated internal
monitoring system that builds a predictive model of the situation and
prioritises damage control operations accordingly. Thus where basic
sensors can tell the crew there is a fire and the civilian version indicates
a power junction in the area, military sensors predict how long it will
be before the power junction is affected and how serious this will
be. A military damage control readout can swamp untrained users
with information but can be instructed to distil out the big picture and
indicate the worst crisis points. As such it can be used by any personnel
who understand how to operate it, although only those with advanced
damage control training can make the best use of the information
available. Military sensors give DM+2 to checks related to damage
control and DM+1 to checks related to repairs.

ASSESSMENT AND PLANNING

The first stage of any damage control operation is assessment and
planning. Sometimes this is little more than noticing the console is on
fire and deciding to put it out but often a plan of action can make all the
difference. Personnel can be distracted by noisy and obvious problems,
possibly missing something that will destroy the ship in a few minutes.

Damage assessment can be performed using the Engineer (damage
control) speciality. Electronics (sensors) can be substituted if the ship has
integrated internal sensors. This means that vessels with civilian or better
sensors are set-up to assist a bridge officer in making an assessment.

Normally assessing damage requires an Average (8+) Engineer (damage
control) check but this can vary depending on the circumstances.
Sometimes an alarm will indicate a problem in a particular area due to an
electrical fault when in fact the problem is elsewhere. Running down the
cause might require ignoring the system and using old-fashioned manual
methods or creatively reconfiguring readouts to find the false data.

The Effect of a damage assessment can be applied to all damage control
(but not repair) related checks on systems included in the assessment.
So if, for whatever reason, a Traveller performs a detailed assessment of
damage to the hull but ignores the ship’s internal systems, the Effect of the
assessment applies only to attempts to shore up the hull. At the Referee’s
discretion this might also include hull-mounted systems or systems running
through the hull such as power conduits or ventilation systems.

DAMAGE CONTROL OPERATIONS
All personnel who work aboard starships learn about damage control
operations. Those who serve aboard less formally organised vessels
such as free traders often gain a rule-of-thumb education in damage
control operations along the way; shipping lines and military forces
routinely train their personnel.
```

```
Any Traveller receiving a level of the Engineer skill can take it in the
speciality of Engineer (damage control). This skill does not replace
others, such as Vacc Suit, when undertaking damage control operations
but does allow the Traveller to tackle any damage control situation at
their full skill level. This means that the damage control expert can deal
with electronic problems, liquid leakage, physical damage, fires or any
other sort of problem even if they do not have skills associated with that
kind of work. However, this applies only to tasks related to controlling
damage; in other words preventing the situation from becoming any
worse. A damage control expert can stop the bulkhead cracking any
further and patch it to prevent air loss, however a repair requires the
relevant skill – in this case Mechanic.
```

```
Due to the training all shipboard personnel receive, anyone who has a
skill relating to ship operations – pilots, sensor operators, astrogators,
gunners, engineers and stewards – is treated as having skill level 0 when
attempting any damage control check.
```

```
Travellers may use relevant skills at the normal level, if they possess
them. The check to conduct damage control operations is the same as
the requirement to carry out a repair, so Engineer (power) could be used
to perform damage control on a failing power plant, for example.
```

```
Physical components and mechanical machinery, including pipes
and simple systems like fans or hatch latching mechanisms require
Mechanic skill.
```

```
Electronic systems and complex machinery requires the Electronics or
Engineer skill.
```

```
Fires are fought using Engineer (damage control). Those without this
skill are treated as skill level 0 if they have any shipboard skills.
```

```
Chemical threats such as toxic gas or chemical spills are normally dealt
with using relevant Profession skills but most crewmembers know how to
flush a contaminated compartment and the ship’s databases will indicate
how to neutralise most hazardous compounds. The Mechanic or Medic
skill will apply to making a compartment safe for habitation once more.
```

```

```

DEALING WITH A DAMAGE EFFECT

Sometimes a single check is required to deal with a particular problem. A
minor air leak can be controlled by slapping an emergency patch on it. In
most cases the patch will hold or it will not; if it does the problem can be
properly dealt with later and if not, another attempt can be made. Much
the same applies to a jammed hatch – normally it is either forced or cut
open, or it is not.

In some cases, multiple checks will be required. Examples include an
air leak through multiple holes or a hatch that can be partially opened
but requires several attempts before it ceases to be an obstacle. How
long each attempt takes can vary considerably. Forcing a jammed hatch
might require 1D minutes’ work; cutting through a warped bulkhead to
release trapped crewmembers might require hours of effort.

Where multiple checks are required, each one reduces the severity of
the problem by a level; serious to minor, minor to trivial and so forth.
Normally once a problem is reduced to trivial (or possibly even minor)
level it is safe to leave it and deal with something else but some problems
like fires must be fully dealt with or may start to escalate again.

The difficulty of most damage control checks is Average (8+), with DM-
if the problem is Serious and DM-4 if it is Severe. A Trivial problem
gives DM+4 if a roll is necessary at all; the Referee may rule that Trivial
problems can be fixed by anyone making the effort.

The exception to this system is cascading hull failure. Checks are
normally made at Average difficulty and the per-round hull damage effect
is reduced by the Effect of each successful check. Problems of this sort
are generally large enough to permit (or require) several people to work
at once. The Referee should keep a note of the total Effect achieved
by damage control parties and deduct this from further damage each
round. In any round where hull damage is zero (or less), the damage
control attempt has been successful and the ship will not suffer more hull
damage from this source.

_For example, a subsidized merchant is suffering cascading hull failure at
a rate of 4D Hull per round. Her crew achieve a total Effect of 5 on their
damage control checks but the Referee rolls 17 on 4D for Hull damage.
The ship loses an additional (17-5) = 12 Hull. Next round the crew
manage a combined Effect of 3, making their total 8. The Referee rolls
7 on 4D for lost Hull; since this is less than the running damage control
total of 8 the breach stops widening. The crew can see starlight through
the side of their ship but at least the problem is not getting worse..._

BEAKED MONKEY (OR BEAKER)
(Psittarhynchus fructophagii)
```

```
Beakers (as they are sometimes called ) are common on many worlds,
both in the wild and in captivity. In addition, they are found on many
starships as pets. Their planet of origin is not known but the animals can
be documented as far back as far as 300 years pre-Imperial, with a range
almost as widespread as at the present.
```

```
Beaked monkeys typically weigh 2 to 3 kilograms and measure 60-
centimeters in length, half of which is generally taken up by the tail. Tails
are sometimes bobbed on animals kept aboard spacecraft. Beakers are
covered by short fur, most commonly brown or grey. Black is rare, and
white extremely so (roll 2D for 2-7 brown, 8-10 grey, 11 black and 12 white).
```

```
The skeleton and musculature follow typical Terran vertebrate norms.
Respiration is accomplished by the usual paired lung arrangement,
the circulatory system is closed and the heart four chambered, making
the animal very similar to certain small Terran mammals such as the
squirrel monkey.
```

```
The animal’s most notable feature, the beak, is formed of two bony
projections from the palate and mandible, covered by a horny substance
resembling keratin. The lower third of the oesophagus is extremely
heavily muscled and lined with a number of tooth-like grinding structures,
which break swallowed food into fragments small enough to be digested
readily. In the wild, the beaker is arboreal and is thought to have originally
subsisted on a diet of hard-shelled nuts and seeds, although specimens
have been observed eating insects and other small animals. In captivity,
beakers thrive on almost any available type of human food.
```

```
The animals are quite popular as pets on starships because of their
gregarious affection to almost all humans, their intelligence and their
scrupulous cleanliness.
```

```
Some individuals are rumored to act as a booster for certain psionic
activities but this last ability has not been proven to the satisfaction of most
authorities. A Traveller can detect a beaker with psionic enhancement
potential by making a successful PSI check.
```

```
The beaker must live in close proximity with the human desiring the
boost for at least three months. They must then be within one meter
of each other during the time the boost is taking place. If this distance
is exceeded, roll 2D. On 6+ the beaker will die. Roll once each combat
round while the separation continues.
```

```
11
```

The human desiring the boost must have a PSI 5+.

If all of these conditions are met, the beaker will raise the Traveller’s
PSI characteristic temporarily by +1D. Each time the Traveller’s PSI is
boosted, roll 2D. On 12+, the beaker will die from the effort. If a beaker
dies during psi contact with the Traveller, that Traveller will permanently
lose -1 from their PSI.

BLOODVARK
(Megalorhinos osmichnilatis claudii)
```

```
Bloodwarks – also called walking noses and Hoovers, for reasons
unknown – are four-limbed mammal-like creatures native to Lantoli. They
have been introduced as trade items to worlds throughout the Imperium
and are often purchased by the law enforcement agencies of planets of
TL5-9.
```

```
These strong, hairy animals mass between 50-70 kilograms when full
grown, stand 80 centimeters high at the shoulder and average 230
centimeters in length, including the bushy tail. They are omnivores,
preferring small, burrowing animals or hive insects, which they dig up
with their foreclaws, but can subsist on berries and sweet grasses. This
adaptability has let them adjust to, and thrive on, a number of planets in
a variety of climates. Bloodvarks are best known for their uncanny sense
of smell. Once put on the trail of a fugitive or animal prey (by letting them
smell an article of clothing or recently-handled item, for instance), they
will follow it relentlessly and without stopping for days at a time. They
can follow trails a week old in good weather, although they will lose a
trail after about four hours of steady hard rain or snow. They have been
known to follow a fresh trail – less than six hours old – across streams or
along the ground under branches used by an escaping prisoner, picking
up traces of scent still hanging in the air. They do not tire easily; they are
worked on leashes day and night by handlers swapping in relay. The
animals used by local police forces are trained for their tasks, usually by
the agency that raises them, a process which takes three months.
```

```
Bloodvarks have extremely poor eyesight and only fair hearing. Normally
gentle, they attack if wounded, cornered or provoked, with powerful
swipes of their long claws.

Their usefulness as trackers makes them valuable trade items. Trained
bloodvarks can fetch as much as Cr800 on the world where they are
purchased; untrained animals bring about Cr100 each. Their size and
single-mindedness makes them unattractive as pets but because of their
intelligence and fierce loyalty, human handlers frequently become quite
attached to their charges. Bloodvarks are oviparous and bisexual. The
female digs a den in soft earth under a fallen tree or large boulder, buries
two or three 15 centimeters eggs under loosely packed soil and lays over
them until they hatch. The young dig themselves out and cling to the
mother’s abdominal hair, where they hang and nurse for about 5 months.

SEA BEAR
(Pseudoarctos ansonii, et al)
```

```
Sea bears are native to Thengo, a planet in the Chronor subsector, but
seem to have been used in pre-imperial colonization projects in the
Jewell, Lianic and Massina subsectors, and are now found on many
planets in those regions.
```

```
Adults are typically 100 to 120 centimeters in length, and weigh from
20 to 25 kilograms. The skeleton is calciferous, internal, and generally
resembles that of a Terran vertebrate, except in the number of limbs and
framing of the body cavity. The spinal column runs from the base of the
skull dorsally along the body until it reaches the pelvis. In place of ribs,
the sea bear’s body cavity is supported by short lengths of bone joined
in what some have described as geodesic fashion, i.e., as a series of
mutually interconnected triangles. This arrangement is very sturdy and
provides excellent protection to the internal organs.
```

```
Externally, the most notable feature of the sea bear is its number of
limbs. Oddly enough for an animal of its size, the sea bear has four
pairs of limbs; one posterior locomotory pair, one anterior pair used
in defence and food acquisition, and two medial pairs that can serve
either purpose. The head is typical, a bony cranium to protect the brain,
upon which are mounted paired sensory organs, (eyes, nose, ears and
a ventrally located mouth. The nose is located well forward, apparently
as an adaptation for breathing while partially submerged. Respiration
and circulation are handled by the typical arrangement of paired lungs
coupled with a closed circulatory system.

Sea bears are carnivores and usually found along seashores and in
shallow off-shore areas of large bodies of water. They are solitary
hunters, preying upon small aquatic and semi aquatic animal life.
The sea bear usually hunts by swimming slowly along the surface
and diving upon its prey from above, taking it by surprise. During the
mating season, sea bears will congregate in huge groups, sometimes
consisting of hundreds of individuals.

##### JUMP BOATS

```
It is widely accepted that no craft smaller than 100 tons displacement
can maintain a stable jump field and by convention any vessel capable
of jumping is termed a ‘starship’. However, there is a need for small
interstellar vessels to fulfil a number of roles. These craft are called ‘jump
boats’ as they are not intended to operate independently for any length
of time. Instead, they are carried aboard larger craft or held ready at
installations, making a run when necessary. The crew only live aboard
during a voyage – the rest of the time they are billeted at their parent
installation or aboard a larger vessel hopefully a bit less claustrophobic
than a tiny jump boat.
```

```
STARSTREAK FAST COURIER
The Starstreak was developed to meet the needs of corporations
and governments requiring fast data transfer regardless of the costs
involved. Built at a mature TL15, the Starstreak is only available from
a handful of yards scattered across Imperial space. Its primary role is
as an information courier, carrying the latest updates in the financial,
political and military arenas.
```

```
The Starstreak is fast, both in real-space and jumpspace, and is lightly
armed and armored for self-defence. It is often used as a VIP transport,
the equivalent of a ‘company car’, by executives who move around a lot.
It is generally able to evade interception or fight its way past piracy and is
therefore a good choice for secure currency transfers or to move secret
prototypes. This makes the Starstreak a prime target for criminals but
few have been successfully taken either by hijack or interception.
```

```
The bridge/living space arrangement of the Starstreak is unusual. The
bridge is located forward but has an open space at the rear serving as
the ship’s tiny common area. This leads to the curious phenomenon of
‘breakfast on the bridge’... in fact, pretty much everything on the bridge
is experienced by Starstreak crews but personnel do not have far to go
if an alert is sounded.
```

```
Aft of the bridge is the living quarters, consisting of a high-quality
stateroom and two standard ones. When the ship is used by an executive,
the large stateroom can include an office or can be luxuriously outfitted to
allow the Starstreak to transport a single VIP in style. Aft of this area of
the ship are the fuel tanks, with an access corridor running through to the
drive rooms. These contain compact jump and maneuver drives, and a
power plant capable of running the ship’s systems with a little to spare.
```

```
17
```

The lower deck is comprised of a small cargo area and additional fuel
tankage. There is sufficient fuel to make a single four-parsec jump or
a combination of jumps adding up to four parsecs over the course of
four weeks. Sometimes a Starstreak will be sent to make a three week
transit of nearby systems, stopping only to send and receive data.
This is wearying for the crew as they are confined in a small area for
the whole of this time but, if combined with a policy of rotating crews
and granting generous downtime, a corporation or government can
stay ahead of the general spread of information – albeit at the price of
maintaining a flotilla of expensive fast couriers.

SUPPLY BOAT
Compared to the high-capability Starstreak, the supply boat is as
mundane as a vessel can be. Indeed, it does not even merit a class
name. Boats of this type are intended to resupply distant outposts,
which may be in a nearby star system or so far in the outsystem that it is
impractical to make a normal-space transit.
```

```
The design is basic yet versatile, with a large fuel tank allowing there-
and-back jumps without refuelling. Hull form is a basic cylinder, much
like a small craft, reflecting the fact that this is an overgrown ship’s boat
with a jump drive rather than a starship in its own right. Nevertheless
these craft give good, if humble, service to installations and starships
across Charted Space.
```

```
Internal layout is slightly unusual, with the small bridge leading
immediately to the main cargo hold rather than the accommodation area
as would be more usual on a ship of this size. Aft of the hold is a fuel tank
containing half the vessel’s reserves, penetrated by an access corridor
leading to the accommodation area. This consists of two standard cabins
and a small common space, and aft of this is another corridor running
through the second fuel tank to the drive room.
```

```
The design philosophy behind this layout may have been intended to
place both flight and engineering working areas equidistant from the
cabins as an egalitarian measure or ensure that personnel interacted.
It has been observed that engineering staff spend more time in their
workspaces than flight crew, often eating there alone rather than
meeting up for meals. It is possible that crew fatigue is reduced by
greater interaction or perhaps the intent was to make the flight crew
walk a bit further to their cabins to make the ship seem a little less
claustrophobic. Whatever the intent, this feature is rare outside vessels
of this general type.

FUEL SUPPLY BOAT

Built on the same hull as the supply boat, the fuel supply boat is a
specialist vessel designed to do nothing more than obtain fuel and haul
it to a refuelling point or installation. Chains of these craft can be used to
laboriously build up a fuel reserve in deep space, permitting a rift to be
crossed or deep-space exploration mission launched. Buddy refuelling
using the Underway Replenishment System allows a sufficiently large
number of these craft to deliver fuel almost anywhere, although the
process is slow and wearying on crews.

Layout is similar to the standard supply vessel version; forward of the
drive chamber is the main fuel tank containing sufficient for a one-parsec
jump and eight weeks of power plant operation. The accommodation
area separates the ship’s own fuel reserve from the bulk tank and
processing equipment. Fuel can be easily transferred, allowing multiple
jumps if necessary. However, with just the tiny accommodation space
and corridors running fore and aft from the drives to the small bridge,
crews find long trips in a ship like this a strain on their nerves.

SHEPHERD PICKET BOAT
The Shepherd was developed to provide a distant (in some cases very
distant) sensor picket capability and has a secondary role as a scout
vessel. Some operators use the Shepherd to guide flights of fighters
or system defence boats, or as a patrol vessel in its own right. In this
capacity its jump drive enables it to reach distant parts of the system or
a neighboring one, creating an ‘armed presence’ to protect commerce
or deter lawbreaking for a very modest price. However, the Shepherd is
no warship and is not really a ship at all; it is designed to operate out of
an installation or parent vessel rather than as a vessel in its own right.
```

```
Although developed as a security vessel, the Shepherd is sometimes
used as a route guide on shipping lanes and by exploration vessels. Its
jump capability allows it to visit systems off the path of the exploration
vessel, collect data and return, or conduct a quick scout of the next system
to be visited whilst the parent ship is engaged in detailed exploration.
```

```
The Shepherd uses a standard cylindrical hull form, with the rather
small flight bridge forward. Immediately aft of this is the operations area,
taking the form of a secondary bridge containing sensor equipment and
controls for the turret. A fuel tank containing half the ship’s reserves,
penetrated by an access corridor, separates the control spaces from
the living area. The second fuel tank lies between the living area and
engineering chamber. As with most vessels of this type it is possible to
turn off the artificial gravity and dive or throw an object from one end of
the ship to the other. This led to the invention of a game called ‘Shepherd
darts’ using this extremely long corridor. It requires incredible skill and is
hazardous to crewmembers who may emerge from a cabin as a projectile
goes by. Not surprisingly, the game is officially discouraged but played
anyway. ‘Playing Shepherd Darts’ is a common figure of speech in some
areas, referring to an extremely dull posting.

##### WORLD SECURITY PROFILES

Travellers can visit countless worlds in their lifetime. Along the way, many
will have reason to fall foul of the law. World Profiles show Referees the
Government Type and Law Level of main worlds, giving an idea of the
level of control and restrictions in place. On occasion, Referees will want
more detail on a world’s security forces. This article provides advice on
interpreting a World Profile to determine the type of security present and
offers an optional Security Profile to record that information.

SECURITY FORCES

Security forces can be divided into three broad categories. These may
not always be separate agencies under some government types or even
be present at all on low-population worlds.

Law Enforcement: Empowered to represent the civil authority and
typically responsible for public order and safety. Officers normally work
to prevent and investigate breaches of the law. Often this will be a police
force; some governments may militarise this organization or draw from
the population on a volunteer basis.

Military: Armed forces with the mandate to protect a nation or
organization and its interests from threats. Normally not concerned with
the enforcement of laws, they do not usually fill policing roles; however
more militaristic governments may use their armed forces for internal

**STOP, POLICE!**
For every world on which the agents of law enforcement are called po-
lice, there is another where this is not the case. When naming a security
force, the Referee should consider wider factors of the world in question
but particularly the type of government. A corporation may simply call
them a security force or know them by a department number. Religious
or oligarchic societies could have more colourful names, often tied to di-
vine or regal figures. Military governments and forces will have functional
names or extremely flamboyant ones, depending upon their leaders.

The Referee should also decide the nickname the population (and the
agents themselves) would refer to this force by. The New Garand Police
Department will almost certainly be known as the NGPD but HMRHPK
does not roll off the tongue to announce Her Most Revered Highness’
Protector Knights when shouted at a fleeing criminal. In this case, ‘Halt,
Protectors!’ would be a more likely choice.

30

```
security. Smaller worlds may not have a standing military, relying on an
armed populace conscripted in time of conflict.
```

```
Intelligence: Covert agencies given the authority to undertake intelligence
gathering, espionage and counter-espionage activities in support of
governmental or organizational interests. These can be small agencies
with specific remits, such as domestic counter-intelligence or information
```

```
31
```

security, or be a single all-encompassing organization. In some governments
these can be military in nature or political in motivation. Worlds with a small
population may not carry out any intelligence activities at all.

Motivations
Security forces are organizations with one overall aim; to ensure a given
area (from a single facility to the entire Imperium) is safe and controlled.
Different governments will emphasise one part of ‘safe and controlled’ over
another. Those with absolute or non-accountable power typically favor
control, a stable society and no threats to their power. More representative
and charismatic leaders tend to favor safety, justice and individual rights;
trusting in the support of a voluntarily law-abiding population.

Law and Justice: Forces whose primary motivation is to uphold the law
and protect citizens are often modelled on the police forces familiar to
most Referees. Bound by a code of conduct and the laws they enforce
(less those exemptions needed for their role), officers tend to be driven
by a wish to keep people safe. Although required to use force in the line
of duty, many officers attempt to do so only as a last resort. Concerned
with individual rights, populations typically view these forces positively.

Order and Stability: Where a government concerns itself with public
order and a smoothly-functioning society, security forces are often
less concerned with civil rights or justice. Normally allowed to ignore
restrictions placed on the population, officers are instructed to target
threats to the government. On more totalitarian worlds, officers can be
above the law and capable of great violence and arbitrary action. They
are often met with distrust, even outright fear, by the population.

The reality is that few forces are completely focussed on one motivation.
Some governments, particularly corporations, create security forces
primarily for order and stability but provide them with an ethical code of
conduct. Even in more open and representative societies there is a need
for enforcement of unpopular rules. Individuals can also have different
priorities. Even the most hard-line fascist government has some officers
with a conscience. The most righteous officer can become quick to reach
for a baton after their fifth set of broken ribs.

Resources and Considerations
A key factor in security operations is the resources required. Tight security
is expensive, both in terms of money and personnel; compromises must
be made and governments must prioritise security tasks.

Economic Realities: To maintain the personnel and equipment required
to police a world costs a significant amount. Money for security must
either come from the population and/or industries of the world, or from
an outside source. Some smaller governments, particularly corporate or
captive ones, will be financed by a larger, richer source. In these cases,

32

```
security forces may receive significant funding. Where a world generates
its own income, security must compete with other areas for resources –
less authoritative leaders are more likely to short-change security than
oppressive ones.
```

```
Projecting a security presence into orbit is a considerable drain and
something smaller independent governments will struggle to heavily
resource. System-wide security is an order of magnitude more costly
again and only the most economically developed worlds can fund that
without external support.
```

```
Small elite units from any security force may be provided with more
sophisticated or expensive equipment and may use equipment of a
higher Tech Level than available on-planet.
```

```
Population Resources: Larger populations generate more income but
in turn require larger security forces to effectively police. Planets with very
small populations (those with Trade Code Lo) may not be able to justify
a large full-time security infrastructure. Worlds with even fewer people
may not employ, or see any need for, permanent security officers. Worlds
with populations in the billions (Trade Code Hi) may cap the number of
officers and rely on surveillance, or informants and domestic spies.
```

```
Higher Security Areas: Worlds that lack the resources or will to provide
security throughout their controlled area will almost certainly have areas
and people upon which security apparatus is focussed. This can also
be the case on even low Law Level worlds, where the government may
enforce more stringent measures in some areas. Corporate worlds may
permit weapons anywhere outside corporate facilities, for example.
```

```
Environment: Some worlds have environments or atmospheres that
pose a significant risk. Travellers acting in a way that threatens those
risks, such as damaging a pressurised dome on a vacuum world, will
face a significantly more robust response to any incident. These forces
will also have weapons tailored to the environment.
```

```
THE SECURITY PROFILE
Referees may use the following profile to summarise the responsiveness,
proactiveness and approach of the security forces. This profile may be
appended to the end of World Profile found in the Traveller Core Rulebook,
following the Travel Code (if any). A Security Profile consists of:
```

S642-5B Fo Im Te

```
The S denotes this is security information, to avoid confusion with other
world data.
```

```
33
```

The four hexadecimal digits denote, in order:

•  Planetary presence
•  Orbital presence (including the presence of forces out to the 100D
point)
•  System presence
•  Security stance

The B denotes this is the Security Profile for the area around the starport
on a balkanised world (omit this for non-balkanised worlds).

This is followed by any Security Codes for the planet.

Security Values
The Presence codes show the likelihood of encountering security forces
in the three areas. Where a given Presence code is lower than the Law
Level, security officers will typically be encountered less often unless
responding to an incident. Presence codes higher than the Law Level
show officers will be encountered more routinely in those locations. The
Stance code shows how common routine stops and questioning will be.
The Law Level of a planet determines the level of active response. Some
World Profile values give automatic Security Profile results:

```
World Profile value Security Profile
Population: 0 No Security Profile
Government: 0
and/or Law Level: 0
```

```
S000-0 (individual responsibility)
```

Planetary Presence: This is the frequency of security officers
or apparatus in the planetary areas controlled by the government. It
reflects both the approach to security and the resources and technology
available. Higher values indicate more officers or technological systems,
whereas lower values indicate areas without regular patrols or monitoring.
Planetary Presence is generated by rolling 2D-7 and adding the Law
Level, modified according to the table below:

```
Planetary Presence DM-2 DM-1 DM+1 DM+2
Size – 9+ 2-3 0-1
Government 2, 12 7, 10 1, 5, 11 6, 13-15
Trade Codes Hi Lo Ht, Ri –
```

Orbital Presence: This represents how common ships and other
security devices are in the orbital areas, including security to the 100
diameter limit. Higher values indicate more ships and defence platforms
within the 100 diameter limit and/or extensive sensors. Lower values may
describe only a few ships or obsolete sensors. A world with no starport

34

```
should have Orbital Presence 0 unless the Referee decides otherwise.
Orbital Presence is obtained by rolling 2D-7 and adding the Law Level,
modified according to the Orbital Presence table.
```

```
Orbital Presence DM-2 DM-1 DM+1 DM+2
Starport E D B A
Size – 10+ 3-4 0-2
Government 2, 7, 12 10 1, 5, 11 6, 13-15
Trade Codes Lo, Lt Po Ag, In, Ht Ri
Base present – – Navy –
```

```
System Presence: This represents how common security ships and
devices are beyond the 100 diameter limit, including security at common
refuelling or transit points and around other bodies in the system. System-
wide security is extremely resource-intensive and the volume of space to
monitor and patrol makes it impossible for all but the richest, most high-
tech systems. Higher values indicate more ships (particularly SDBs on-
station at key areas in the system) and/or extensive deep-space sensor
networks. These may be supported by stations in particularly important
areas where resources permit. Lower values mean fewer ships and likely
a reliance on patrol ships within the 100 diameter limit to intercept vessels
en route to the main world. A world with no starport should have System
Presence 0 unless the Referee decides otherwise. System Presence is
generated by rolling 2D-7 and adding Orbital Presence, modified by the
System Presence table.
```

```

Starport E C, D A –
Government 7 1, 9, 10, 12 – 6
Trade Codes Lo, Po Lt, Ni Ri –
Gas Giants present None – – –
```

```
Stance: This shows how proactive the security force is in executing
its duties. Government attitudes and legal codes influence this. Where
Stance exceeds Law Level, officers are very likely to approach and
question Travellers routinely. A Stance of less than the Law Level shows
a more passive security presence. Secure areas such as military bases
will have a localised Stance of at least 10. Stance is obtained by rolling
2D-7 and adding the Law Level, modified by the Stance table.

36

```
Security Codes
Security codes describe the type of security forces and their most
commonly-used methods. Where a world meets all the requirements
listed for one or more security codes, it gains those codes. Some codes
do not apply in all cases, only when equalling or exceeding the value on
the Security Codes table on 2D, or at the Referee’s discretion based on
the world’s society.
```

```
Corrupt: Graft, bribery and self-interest are extremely common in the
ranks of the security officers. Travellers should expect fair treatment only
if it benefits the officers – or if they can pay for it.
Covert: Whilst most worlds have small covert security forces, this world’s
security is predominantly hidden and consists of extensive surveillance
and in some societies, a network of citizen informants.
Factionalised: Security forces are numerous and often hold very specific
mandates. This can lead to inefficiency and bureaucratic infighting that
can inconvenience (or be exploited by) the Travellers.
Focussed: The strongest security and enforcement is found around key
locations and people, with the rest of the world or system having much
less. High Presence values with the Focussed code can mean extensive
passive monitoring, with significant resources available when needed.
Impersonal: The security forces are less concerned with individual rights
and justice, and more with the laws themselves and public order. A Difficult
(10+) Advocate check can reverse the negative DM on sentencing rolls
on these worlds, as Travellers use the letter of the law to their favor.
Militarised: All key security forces are military in nature. Typically more
heavily armed and armored than civilian security forces, they will
normally be granted significant latitude by the government.
```

```
BALKANISED WORLDS
The Traveller Core Rulebook tells us the Law Level of a balkanised
planet represents the government closest to the starport. Travellers may
visit any number of states on the planet, each with its own Law Level and
legal system, and Referees are free to generate Law Levels and Security
Codes separately based on the different governments, should that level
of detail be desired.
```

```
The Referee should decide the government’s approach to off-planet
security. If a sizeable proportion of the planet’s states cooperate to
maintain a neutral orbit, the Referee should ignore the balkanization DM
for Orbital Presence, to reflect the combined resources. These same
decisions should be made for System Presence.
```

```
Encounters in orbit or the wider system can be with ships from any
government with the appropriate security forces (or a combined force,
if it exists).
```

```
37
```

Pervasive: Security apparatus is wide-ranging and common. This can
vary from constant data-mining of computer networks, to a panopticon of
cameras and gunshot sensors, to guards on every door, depending on
the Tech Level. Pervasive security may be limited to the planet alone or
reach beyond it.
Technological: Main security functions are automated or heavily reliant
on hardware and software. Fewer officers will be present but cameras,
drones and other devices will be very common.
Volunteer: Security forces are made up of volunteers, perhaps led by
one or two paid full-time officer(s). They will typically be less well-trained
but are dedicated to their community.

USING THE SECURITY PROFILE
The Security Profile may be used to guide the likelihood of Travellers
encountering routine security forces in different parts of the world and
system. When Travellers are involved in an incident the Referee should
use the rules in the Traveller Core Rulebook to resolve the encounter. At
the Referee’s discretion Impersonal (Im) worlds give a further DM-2 to
response and sentencing rolls and Corrupt (Cr) worlds allow DM+1 to +4
to sentencing with an appropriate bribe.
```

```
Imperial Bases, Starports and Travel Codes
Security Profiles and security force considerations change for areas
controlled directly by the Imperium. Imperial Navy bases are likely to be
highly secure. Scout bases, whilst less so, still have restricted sections.
```

```
Starports typically follow Imperial procedures and have extraterritoriality
zones that fall under Imperial law (outside this area local laws apply).
These areas are ripe with potential for the Referee to show the difference
in tone and character between Imperial and local security forces.
```

```
Typical representative security profiles for Imperial facilities can be found
in the Imperial Security table.
```

```
Imperial Security
Facility Type Security Profile
Imperial Starport S400-4 Fo
Navy Base S880-A Pe
Scout Base S440-4 Fo
Research Base Project-dependent
```

```
Travel Codes add unique considerations. Amber Zones are likely to be
of higher security interest to the Imperium, resulting in an increased
likelihood of encounter. They may also be in place due to local trouble;
Referees should add appropriate modifiers to encounter rolls to reflect
this. Red Zones are interdicted by the Imperium. Interacting with one of
these should be an adventure in itself.
```

```
The concept of extraterritoriality, often shortened in the Imperium
to extrality, extends beyond the starport in the case of properly
documented diplomats. They are exempt from most local laws and
cannot be prosecuted by local courts. They can, however, be expelled
for breaches of law and order.
```

```
Encounter Likelihood: Roll 2D against the appropriate Presence code
and if the roll is equal to or less, security forces are present in the area.
The Referee should apply DM-4 to checks against Presence or Stance if
```

```
39
```

the Travellers are near important sites or people (with an additional DM-2
if security is Focussed). For routine encounters, the Referee should
decide what kind of security forces are encountered.

Approach likelihood: Roll 2D and if the roll is equal to or less than the
Stance code the Travellers are approached by the security forces for
routine enquiries. Travellers acting suspiciously, or those on isolationist
or xenophobic worlds, should receive DM-2 or more at the Referee’s
discretion. If an active incident occurs, the Referee should use the
Travellers & The Law rules in the Traveller Core Rulebook.

Nature of approach: The Referee should then determine the nature of
the encounter based on the Security Codes, government and security
forces type, and the actions and attitude of the Travellers. An approach
does not automatically result in an attempted apprehension if the
Travellers are reasonable. Some examples are:

•  On a world where there is Pervasive (Pe) Technological (Te) security
the Travellers are observed by cameras; something they are unaware
of unless they pass an Investigate or Recon check at a difficulty set
by the Referee to reflect the Tech Level of the devices.
•  An encounter with one of the forces of a Factionalised (Fa) Impersonal
(Ip) police force may result in the Travellers observing officers
detaining locals for an offence or action the Travellers themselves
are also guilty of – but the officers are from an agency whose remit
does not include policing off-worlders, so do not concern themselves
with the Travellers.

##### THE LOST VILLAGE

```
Location : Gadden (D893200-8) Harlequin subsector, Solomani Rim
```

```
After rescuing a dying stranger from the snow, the Travellers try to
uncover the fate of an entire village.
```

```
GADDEN (D893200-8)
Gadden has an official population of just a few hundred, although there
are many more living in unofficial backwater settlements. The terrain is
mostly barren; the most habitable region is a tundra covering the planet’s
entire mid-latitudes. The starport, Lucky Downs, is barely more than an
open field with a small maintenance shack and fuel pumping station. It is
truly deserving of its Class D classification.
```

```
THE SITUATION
While in jump, the Travellers notice their air/raft has developed engine
problems and communications with the starport indicate that replacement
parts are available in Lucky Downs, the main town. While awaiting
completion of the maintenance, the Travellers take a look around. The
local atmosphere consists of everything Travellers expect of a planet well
off the beaten path; dirt streets, more bars than homes and the typical
houses of ill repute. With a planetary population numbering slightly above
300, this place would soon become very dull.
```

```
In late afternoon, one of the Travellers notices a figure making its way
across the snow and clearly struggling. Helping is at least something to
do, so the Travellers go out and retrieve the man. He turns out to be a
local inhabitant, almost frozen and near death. He manages to get out
the words, ‘They’re... all... gone. Everyone’s... gone,’ before expiring.
```

```
Taking the body to the local doctor, the Travellers learn he was Laster
LeBarre, a hunter from a nearby village. He came into town almost a
fortnight ago to sell his catch of furs, then left to head home. His village
is a two-day trip by snowmobile away. It has been 10 days since he was
last in town.
```

```
It is obvious to the local peace officer, Constable Monteray, that something
bad has happened at Laster’s home village. He cannot investigate
himself as every hunter or trapper within 200 kilometers is in town or will
be soon, selling their catch to be shipped offworld. Monteray is the only
law in town and right now the entire planetary economy is being bartered
in the marketplace.

Monteray wants to deputise the Travellers to go to LeBarre’s village and
investigate what happened. Since their air/raft is still being repaired,
Monteray will loan the Travellers his ‘government’ snowmobiles. There
are two, each capable of carrying four people plus equipment. Pay is
pretty minimal – Cr125 per week. Not much on interstellar standards but,
if pressed, Monteray could manage to have the cost of the air/raft repairs
thrown in. At least it will be something to do while the Travellers wait for
their air/raft to be fixed.

If the Travellers accept they are sworn in as deputies – they are even
given badges to show their status – and provided with a map showing
the route to the town. Monteray also gives the Travellers the names of
the town elders with whom they must speak.

Midway through the first day’s ride, the Travellers discover an
abandoned snowmobile. If they stop to inspect it, the Travellers will
discover title documents identifying it as LeBarre’s. They will also find
a large oil leak in one of the high-pressure lines. LeBarre walked or
ran almost 100 kilometers in sub-zero temperatures with no food to get
back to Lucky Downs.

After the second day’s travel, the Travellers will arrive at the village,
which is little more than a cluster of corrugated metal shacks surrounding
a central fire pit, as dusk falls. The silence is eerie; something is very
wrong here.

As the Travellers search the town, they find no one home, no men, women
or children, although the village probably held twenty or more people.
Lights and heating units are left on and some shacks have food still cooking
above open fires and primitive stoves. Little remains of that now and it is
clear nobody tried to prevent it burning. In some shacks, knitting needles
are left in garments. The signs of a hurried departure are everywhere.

On the other side of the village, a grave lies opened. It is empty and has
a light layer of snow inside.

**REFEREE’S INFORMATION**

At this point, the Travellers have two options; they can stay the night in
this spooky place or ride two more days back to Lucky Downs. If they do
the latter, the constable will listen to their report gravely and inform them
that local citizens never open graves once the body is placed inside. It
must have been the work of off-worlders. He will ask them to conduct
a full investigation, for as long as it takes. If they refuse, he will have to
arrest them on suspicion of some involvement with the disappearances.
The Travellers will be held until an investigation can be conducted.

If the Travellers investigate, they will be able to uncover more details.
They may never piece together exactly what happened but the Referee
should allow them to find enough clues to take an educated guess.

44

```
THE FATE OF THE LOST VILLAGE
Four years ago, Lergei Stallenze arrived on Gadden hoping to make
his fortune as a hunter. After a discouraging season, he and his partner,
Toolian DeGuere, found the remains of a burial mound. Inside they found
a small fortune in gold and jewels, placed by long-forgotten priests.
Because of his superstitions, Toolian refused to allow Lergei to rob the
mound of its riches. Because of their friendship, Lergei agreed.
```

```
Three months ago, Toolian died in an avalanche. His body was recovered
and buried near his home village. Lergei remembered the treasure and
planned to make his fortune. From the starport, he contacted a ship that
was to pick him up on the plain between the village and Lucky Downs,
and then return him to the village.
```

```
Unfortunately, the local villagers’ superstitions required burying all a
man’s possessions with him, so the map to the treasure was buried with
Toolian’s body. Lergei dug open the grave late one night and recovered
the map but was seen by an early-rising member of the village.
```

```
The villagers were outraged. Someone lost their temper and tried to beat
Lergei for his sacrilege but Lergei had a gun. A brave woman jumped
him, trying to prevent another shooting and died for it. Her friends rushed
to help, or fled, or grabbed weapons, and Lergei kept firing. He knew he
would be put on trial for murder if he did not escape and in his panic he
could not tell who was a threat and who was not.
```

```
One death led to another and he eventually killed everyone who did not
flee. Those who did escaped into the wilderness and eventually died.
Lergei tied the bodies of those he killed together and sank them in the
nearby lake, then went off to find the treasure.
```

```
With the map leading the way, Lergei was able to recover the treasure and
meet the starship that spirited him to safety. Laster LeBarre was away at
the time, making an early trip to the starport to sell his catch. But for that
decision he, too, might have disappeared at the bottom of an icy lake.
```

```
If the Travellers conduct a comprehensive search of the half-frozen lake
they will eventually find the bodies of those who fought Lergei. Out on
the surrounding plains the frozen bodies of men, women and children
may be found, huddled into inadequate shelter – in many cases without
even outdoor clothing. In the nearby foothills is a pillaged burial mound,
although it would be hard to find.
```

```
Even if the Travellers manage to figure out what happened here, they
will not find Lergei. They might someday encounter him, however, and
realise he has some connection to the lost village.

AT-4

ROUGH TERRAIN SNOWMOBILE

The AT-4 snowmobile is designed for operations in rougher terrain
than standard arctic terrain transport. Its blocky central body runs on
four separate track units, each of which has an inner and outer track.
Front and back tracks are independently steerable and can climb over
obstacles up to one meter in height. The AT-4 can run on three track
units, enabling it to continue moving despite total traction loss on one
track unit – or crippling damage to it.

Each track unit has a deployable frontal shield that acts as a snowplough
and obstacle deflector. Running with the shield in place slows the
vehicle to Very Slow but it protects the track units from most hazards.
To climb over an obstacle the shield has to be raised; forgetting to do
so can result in it becoming jammed against the obstruction rather than
climbing over it.

The main body of the vehicle sits high above the track units, reached by
ladders at each side. At the rear of the vehicle is an external stowage
area for equipment, which is boxed in but not insulated in the same way
as the cab. It is reached via a retractable step/lift, enabling bulky or heavy
items to be loaded and unloaded with relative ease.

The cab itself has room for four people and some small items of gear. It
is arranged with a driving seat at the front right and a bench seat at the
rear. The right-hand door leads into the rear part of the compartment; the
left leads into a small space where a passenger seat might be on another
vehicle. In theory this permits the driver some freedom of movement
when donning cold weather clothing, although in practice the space is
normally jammed with miscellaneous tools and equipment. Clambering
over these obstructions in a parka can be hazardous.

A light internal partition separates the two front seats from the rear ones,
preventing at least some of the heat inside the vehicle from escaping
when a door is opened. There is a cooker/heater unit at the very rear,
along with some stowage space. The seat can be used as a passable
bed by one person.

The AT-4 is not a cheap vehicle when new but it is rugged and long-
lasting. It is common to find examples that have been passed down
from one user to another, becoming ever more decrepit in the process.
Known faults among older AT-4 include a tendency for connections to
the central track lubrication reservoir to fail, dumping the contents and
quickly resulting in seizure of one or more sets of tracks.

## TRAVELLINGTRAVELLING

FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELT
Landing is the most stressful part of flying a spacecraft. Despite this, most
would vastly prefer to handle landing manually than trust a computer.
For all the statistics about safety and acknowledged contribution of pilot-
assist systems, there is no reassurance like a person with their hands
on the controls... assuming, of course, the pilot is not trying to show off.

LANDING DIFFICULTY

The base difficulty of a Pilot check to land a starship or spacecraft on a
flat surface is Average (8+), assuming a cautious approach and good
landing conditions. Difficulty can be decreased to Routine (6+) by taking
longer to set-up the approach and coming in very slowly, or by taking a
‘just get it on the pad’ approach. This means banging the ship down hard

- not hard enough to damage it but in a manner that looks heavy-handed
and will upset passengers. There are occasions where the pilot may elect
for an even worse landing – usually when something is dreadfully wrong.
If the pilot chooses to make what amounts to little more than a crash-
landing without good cause there may be repercussions but sometimes
deliberately slamming the ship down hard is the only way to get it on the
ground fast enough. If so, the base difficulty becomes Easy (4+).

The converse of this also applies. Trying to make an extremely smooth
landing increases the difficulty to Difficult (10+), whilst attempting a
perfect touchdown without increasing the time required to set everything
up just right increases difficulty to Very Difficult (12+).

The chosen level of difficulty indicates the level of smoothness the
pilot is aiming for. The Effect of the check determines how close they
come to achieving it. An excellent check cannot make a low-difficulty
landing much better than what the pilot was trying for but a bad check
can be very unfortunate. Thus only the best pilots – or those trying
to show off – will cut their landings very fine. Lesser mortals tend
to shoot for ‘good enough’ and limit the possibility of disaster. Note
that Heavy landing resulting from a failed attempt at a Standard or
Smooth landing will look worse and be rougher than a deliberate
Heavy landing performed successfully.

48

```
Landing Difficulty Characteristics
Easy (4+) Emergency crash-landing: Will cause minor
damage (1D) to the ship and personnel (1D). No
pilot would deliberately land like this unless there
was an overwhelmingly important reason.
Routine (6+) Heavy: A hurried, heavy-handed and clumsy
landing which will antagonise passengers and
embarrass the crew but cause no real harm.
Average (8+) Standard: A typical not-very-good-but-safe
landing, probably a little bumpy for passengers
but good enough for most pilots.
Difficult (10+) Smooth: A near-perfect touchdown that will
impress other experts and generate a reputation
as a good pilot. High-end liners and yachts often
expect this level of competence as standard.
Very Difficult (12+) Perfect: Elegant and smooth as silk, yet
unhurried and apparently effortless...
```

```
For example, a young and eager shuttle pilot who wants to impress his
line commodore decides to attempt a Smooth landing with a difficulty of
Difficult (10+). He has to stay in his assigned landing slot, so cannot take
a long time about it even if he wanted to – and he does not, because
slow and careful will not make the same impression as brisk and smooth.
Unfortunately he ends up with Effect -4 on his Pilot check. This downgrades
his landing from Smooth to Heavy and is a worse example of a heavy
landing than he would have performed if he had just banged the shuttle
onto the pad any old how. The line commodore is not impressed at all...
```

DOCKING AND

```
ORBITAL PORT LANDINGS
In many ways, landing at an orbital starport or docking with another vessel
is the easiest landing-related task. However, there are still important
considerations. No well-regulated port ever allows a ship to make a direct
approach, other than at low speed in the final moments before touchdown.

-6 Disastrous: The landing is a particularly rough example of three
levels worse than the pilot was aiming for. Even if the ship is not
damaged and there are no serious injuries, questions will be asked.
If the local conditions are bad (for example, trying to land in a storm)
the ship will almost certainly crash.
```

Whilst this would be more convenient, there is always a danger of
engine or control malfunctions, or pilot error, causing the craft to smash
into the port.

Vessels making a direct approach will be warned off and then fired upon
by most stations. The incident could be a ramming attack by terrorists or
other enemies or just an unfortunate out of control vessel. Either way, the
port needs to break up the incoming craft to mitigate damage. This policy
also serves to deter hotshots who think they can ignore the port traffic
controllers’ instructions. A Class A orbital port with tens of thousands of
people aboard simply cannot afford to take risks with a large piece of
metal directly inbound.

Assuming the pilot makes a sensible approach and turns towards the
port at the correct time – and at reasonable speed – then docking or
landing is not a difficult business. Some ports, especially those with
individual docking bays, run artificial gravity at a minimal level to avoid
a hazard at the local field/free space interface, a technical term for the
point where a vessel becomes subject to the port’s internal gravity field.
This takes place over a short distance and with larger ships can create a

50

```
gravitational gradient along the length of the ship, creating a potentially
violent pitching movement that can send a vessel nose-first into the floor
of the dock.
```

```
Where individual bays are available it is standard practice to reduce
local gravity to almost nothing, allowing a pilot to position their ship on
the pad without interference. Local gravity is then increased steadily to
allow the ship to settle and crew to disembark in comfort. This is not
possible in large communal docking bays, so more commonly the bay
is maintained at a low gravity level – around 0.4g – as a compromise
between safety and comfort.
```

```
Crossing the interface is part of the landing procedure and does not pose
an undue hazard for a pilot expecting it. However, if the internal gravity
field of the station is not set at the expected level there may be problems.
Ports inform incoming ships of their standard setting and procedure as
part of the standard data transfer upon contacting the port authority but
if this information is incorrect (or the gravity generators malfunction)
a vessel will experience a hazard as the pilot attempts to correct for
an increase in gravity that does not happen or experiences a sudden
increase when one is not expected. Dealing with this requires an Average
(8+) Pilot check, with DM-3 per g of internal gravity.
```

```
The latter only applies where there is an unusually high level of artificial
gravity in the docking bay, which would require a serious malfunction or
hostile action. Cranking the artificial gravity right up or setting it to fluctuate
randomly, is a useful defensive tactic although it will only slow down an
assault rather than inflicting crippling damage on incoming craft. Once
across the interface, landing is as normal at the chosen difficulty level
unless gravity is fluctuating, in which case the DM-3 per g still applies.
```

```
ROCKBALL LANDINGS
Planetary landings vary in complexity depending on the local conditions.
On a very small and low-gravity body it is possible to treat the
landing area much like an orbital installation, flying straight in without
establishing an orbit. This is unwise when landing on larger bodies,
however. Normal practice is to make at least a partial orbit – although
not necessarily at a velocity that would produce a stable orbit – before
beginning a steady descent.
```

```
This orbit-descend-land pattern is important where there is considerable
traffic; less so on a distant rockball that gets three ships a year
through its port. The use of stages allows sensor data to be collected
or communication with groundside installations to be established and
demonstrates the incoming ship is capable of operating in a responsible
fashion. A lot of time can be saved by just streaking in at full thrust and
```

```
51
```

at low-traffic ports this may be the norm. It will alarm and annoy other
vessels and traffic controllers in busier systems, however.

Landing on an airless, low-gravity world is about as easy as any landing
can be, although there are still hazards. Chief among these is a tendency
to bounce or skid. A craft touching down with any forward or sideways
velocity will slide some distance and might even rebound slightly, losing
contact with the landing pad. This is purely due to lack of significant
friction between the pad and landing gear resulting from low gravity. The
ideal remedy is a perfect touchdown, in which the vessel settles with
zero velocity in any direction except downwards and very little of that. A
perfect touchdown also requires perfectly balanced and lightly applied
thrust such that the vessel is gently pushed down onto the pad and does
not scrape sideways after landing.

If the pilot is still struggling to balance thrust upon landing, the craft may
skitter across the pad and require additional corrections. Vessels have
gone out of control and rammed installations or other craft in the hands
of a heavy-handed pilot who over-corrected horizontal drift on the pad.
The usual way to avoid this is to put the ship down quite hard, using
thrust to push it into the pad and make the landing feet get a good grip.
This equates to a Heavy landing and is considered the province of lesser
pilots. Those who prefer to settle gently without the passengers even

52

```
realising they have landed make the check at a higher difficulty level but
run the risk of something going wrong.
```

```
A successful Pilot check indicates the craft is safely down and the
landing was as good as could be expected. A heavy-handed ‘lawn
dart’ landing (as some pilots call the more solid approach) will always
be bumpy and looks clumsy – although less clumsy than bouncing 20
meters across the pad, overcorrecting the movement and shooting off
in a different direction.
```

```
LANDING IN ATMOSPHERE
Landing in atmosphere is subject to all the same considerations as a
rockball landing, with the additional variable of weather. It is rarely feasible
to streak steeply down from orbit – starports located close to cities do not
permit this, even if the atmosphere is thin enough to permit such a steep
approach. More commonly, a craft will descend from orbit in a curve or on
a dogleg course, turning onto a direct approach only as it nears port.
```

```
If weather is good and there are no unusual considerations, the pilot
chooses the difficulty level for his attempted quality of landing and
proceeds as normal. However, weather is not always good and on some
worlds conditions can make a smooth landing a near-impossibility. That
does not mean the skipper will not demand one, of course.
```

```
The following modifiers are applied to attempts to land in atmosphere or
on larger worlds:
```

```
Atmospheric Landings
Factor DM
World Size 8- No DM
World Size 9 -1
World Size 10 -2
High Gravity World (such as a Super-Earth) -3 or more
Minor Weather Conditions -1
Serious Weather Conditions -2
Violent Weather Conditions -3
Extreme Weather Conditions -4
Standard Atmosphere -1
Dense Atmosphere -2
Very Dense Atmosphere -3
Partially Streamlined Ship (if Atmosphere 4+) -2
Unstreamlined Ship (if Atmosphere 2+) -4
```

```
53
```

Minor Weather Conditions refers to mild crosswinds, light rain and similar
conditions. On most worlds this is easy for the pilot to correct for but
might be a real problem on a dense atmosphere planet.

Serious Weather Conditions refers to strong and gusty winds, heavy rain
or a relatively light sand or dust storm.

Violent Weather Conditions refers to storm-force or very gusty winds and
storm or gale conditions.

Extreme Weather Conditions refers to hurricane-force winds and similarly
bad conditions.

Results are always subject to Referee interpretation. A pilot who tries
for a low-difficulty landing and fails the check should suffer less serious
consequences than one who was hoping for perfection but falls far short,
due to greater margins for error.

_For example, the pilot of a subsidized merchant wants to land in the
middle of a storm on a dense atmosphere world. With a total DM-5 for the
conditions, the pilot decides to play safe and shoot for a Heavy landing.
This is a Routine (6+) Pilot check with DM-5 for the conditions and DM+2
for the Pilot’s skill. The dice come up an 8... -5 and +2 gives a total of
5 for Effect -1. The pilot attempted a Heavy landing and fell short of
the mark a little. The touchdown feels like an emergency crash-landing
but the ship is down and basically safe. Had the pilot tried for a perfect
landing it would have been Very Difficult (12+) with the same DMs and the
final outcome would be Effect -7. Three categories worse than Perfect is
Heavy but the Referee should take into account that this pilot was trying
for the near-impossible when something went badly awry. Effect -1 on an
attempt to play it safe should hurt a lot less than Effect -7 on an unwise
attempt at perfection._

##### THE VIRUSHI

```
With a length of nearly three meters, standing close to 180 centimeters
at the shoulder and massing close to 1,000 kilograms, the Virushi are
among the largest intelligent races known to the Imperium. Virshash
is a Size A, dense atmosphere world just within the borders of Imperial
space of Reaver’s Deep; atmospheric density notwithstanding, the
planet is heavily irradiated by the more distant of the world’s two suns.
These factors of high gravity, dense atmosphere and heavy radiation
have shaped the Virushi, guiding their evolution into the awesome
form of today.
```

```
The Virushi are squat, massively built creatures, covered by overlapping
plates of leathery armor. They walk – and can run, with surprising
speed – on four tree-thick legs and are capable of extraordinarily delicate
manipulation with two sets of arms. The arms of the lower pair are
heavily muscled and extremely powerful; the upper pair seem withered
by comparison but are amazingly dextrous.
```

```
Their semi-erect posture has led some humans to call the Virushi ‘centaurs
with tank blood’ or ‘intelligent bulldozers’. They are immensely strong but
this strength must be set against poor sensory equipment. Their eyes,
nearly buried beneath massive brow ridges, work well in brilliant sunlight
but are not at all good for seeing in poor lighting conditions; they are
almost useless in darkness. Their ears are evolved for hearing sounds
transmitted in the dense atmosphere of their homeworld. Normal sounds
in a standard atmosphere are near their lower threshold of hearing.
```

```
SOCIETY
As the Virushi progressed towards civilization, an unusual social unit –
called the ‘cooperative’ by sophontologists – came into being. Individual
Virushi had to eat a great deal, and range over a wide area, to feed their
massive bodies. The tendency, then, was towards a highly individualistic,
even solitary existence. However, those individuals who cooperated in
building shelters, making tools, tending fire and, of course, raising families
had a better chance of survival. The resultant culture today is semi-
feudal. Obligation and duty are complex and interwoven; the individual’s
love of freedom is carefully balanced against a feeling of responsibility
towards others. The concept of coercive government is inconceivable –
and incomprehensible – to these people. They give freely of their own
abilities and services, and expect a minimum of outside interference in
their lives. A Virushi will work in voluntary cooperation with others but
cannot be ordered to do something it does not want to do.

```
Although they appear frightening to humans, the Virushi are a gentle race,
largely because they are of such great size and strength. As one of the
larger lifeforms on their homeworld, they were not forced to aggressively
dominate their environment and cultural units never evolved past the
cooperative stage. Organised states, large governments and large-scale
warfare never came into being. A lack of drive has tended to keep the
Virushi from becoming anything more than what they have always been;
a contented, pastoral, almost utopian culture. Many individuals, however,
do possess an urge to leave their homes, see the universe and try to
serve others as they have always served their own cooperatives.
```

```
Virushi found off their homeworld are most likely to be engaged in a
career that stresses service to others; others are found in work that caters
```

```
Virshash
Urlaqqash subsector
```

56

```
to their highly individualistic way of life. Their great dexterity makes them
excellent doctors – indeed, a Virushi surgeon was recently elevated to
the emperor’s personal medical staff. An extreme dedication and fervour
to help others characterises such Virushi encountered in jobs of this kind.
```

```
Because they will not take orders, Virushi do not join the military despite
the fact that their great size would make them fearsome fighters. Many
an Imperial drill sergeant has been heard bemoaning the fact that such
perfect fighting machines are also pacifists who do not even understand
the concept of war. In their chosen fields, however, the Virushi have
distinguished themselves on many occasions.
```

```
EQUIPMENT AND VEHICLES
Virushi hands are close to human in terms of shape and articulation but
they prefer equipment built to cope with their size and bulk – human gear
tends to get crushed or come apart far too easily. As a result, an item built
for Virushi will be more robust, heavier and costs one and a half times as
much as the human equivalent. A Virushi using human equipment can do
so without undue risk if they have time to be careful. Under stress, such
as combat, there is a straight chance of 12+ on 2D that the item will be
broken when used.
```

```
Virushi require a great deal of space to hold their massive bulk. When
carrying Virushi in starships or otherwise providing accommodation,
tonnage requirements are twice those for humans. To be comfortable, a
starship cabin must displace at least eight tons, while cramped or military
facilities require half that. Virushi will endure discomfort stoically but it
is wise to provide staterooms of sufficient size to avoid severe damage
to the room’s interior by accidental flicks of the tail. A partition can be
removed between two existing staterooms and heavy-duty Virushi
furnishings installed, for Cr5000. Most Virushi passengers will cheerfully
pay the extra amount on a ticket to have such modifications made.
```

```
Environment is also a factor. Accustomed to dense atmospheres, Virushi
treat a standard atmosphere as thin and a thin atmosphere as very thin.
They tend to make jokes about their vacuum-breathing friends, while
humans in Virushi conditioned rooms often complain of drowning in the
thick soup Virushi like to breathe.
```

```
VIRUSHI TRAVELLERS
Virushi are gentle, compassionate and do not indulge in aggressive
speech or behaviour. Extremely polite and soft-spoken at all times, the
Virushi voice is naturally rather quiet and weak, due to differences in
atmospheric pressure between their own world and those of humans.
```

```
Virushi will fight, particularly when the lives of friends or charges are
threatened. They do not, however, seek conflict. They rarely carry weapons
```

```
57
```

and prefer negotiation to combat. Placid in the face of threats, and largely
indifferent to pain, the Virushi never become angry. They will tend to be
concerned, even apologetic, if forced to cause damage or pain.

Virushi will not give orders, although they may make suggestions and offer
advice in a diffident fashion (which sometimes inspires a quick obedience
from those around who feel that the awesome body, rather than the gentle
mind, should be obeyed in every whim!). Equally, they do not take orders,
although they may be persuaded to do something for the common good.
Virushi expect this same behaviour from others but are more amused
than troubled by the alien (to them) lack of harmony and cooperation
found among other species. Attempted coercion and threats do not move
or anger them. At first, Virushi will be amused by, and then ignore, such
gambits. Reason and negotiation will be attempted for as long as possible
but finally, if all else fails, they will humbly and apologetically deal with their
antagonist using as much violence as necessary.

Limitations on Virushi senses should be kept in mind at all times. Soft
sounds are inaudible to Virushi and peripheral vision is very limited.
Responding to anything behind them requires a ponderous turn, making
them slow to respond to threats from their rear.

Psionic powers are not uncommon among the Virushi but, like all other
Imperial citizens, their development and use are suppressed.

More than anything else, their philosophy of non-violence colours
everything the Virushi do. They may spend hours trying to persuade
non-Virushi comrades of the benefits of peaceful negotiation, reason and
discussion, and might need to be persuaded of the need to carry out a
plan involving violence even if there is absolutely no alternative.

Characteristics
STR and END are both determined by rolling 1D+10. These characteristics
can be improved by later modifications earned during the Virushi’s career
to as high as 20.

DEX is determined by rolling 2D+2.

SOC is determined by rolling 2D-2. Virushi SOC does not improve as a
result of service; any increase gained during a career is applied to EDU
instead. The Virushi do not care about the intricacies of society and do
not fit in well; they simply do not share the same concerns about status
as most within the Imperium.

Traits
Virushi Travellers all possess the following traits.

Weapons Aversion: Virushi have little knowledge of or aptitude for
using weapons. The first skill earned in either Gun Combat, Gunner,

58

```
Heavy Weapons or Melee is always at level zero, after which the skill
is increased as normal.
```

```
Walking Tank: All Virushi have Protection 4 from their natural armor
and can make two attacks* with natural weapons (tail lash or stomps) per
combat round. Each attack uses Melee (natural) and does 2D damage.
```

```
Poor Senses: Virushi suffer DM-2 on all Recon and Survival checks
when using their natural senses outside their normal environment. The
modifier would not apply to vision in very bright light or hearing in a
dense atmosphere, for example, but under ‘human-norm’ conditions a
Virushi is at a disadvantage.
```

```
Careers
Virushi cannot enter any organised military career such as Army, Navy
and Marines.
```

```
Virushi receive DM+1 on enlistment checks to join the Scouts, as their
way of life appeals to Virushi individualism. Virushi also receive DM+1
on checks to enter professions that require self-reliance and/or involve
helping others. The most obvious examples are the medical profession
and service aboard a free trader, but a case can be made for others.
```

##### GANSUR TENDER

The Gansur was conceived as a workhorse vessel that could be adapted
to a number of different roles. It is built around a central docking/grappling
area capable of supporting four craft each of up to 100 tons displacement
or two craft of up to 200 tons. These may be small starships such as
the Type S scout/courier or much smaller vessels such as cutters and
launches. However, the Gansur really comes into its own when used as
a tender to support jump boat operations.

Jump boats are the smallest jump-capable craft available, typically
displacing exactly 100 tons. Whilst this, and the fact they carry a jump
drive, might cause some observers to define these vessels as starships,
they are not designed for independent operations and require the support
of a tender or installation.

The Gansur uses a standard close structure design with command and
control spaces forward, drives aft and the ‘working’ parts of the ship in
between. All capabilities are calculated assuming the vessel has 400
tons of small craft attached to its grapples. It can make 2.5g acceleration
without any craft attached, which does not in any way compromise the
vessel’s integrity.

Craft are carried on a pair of outriggers aligned with the ship’s main axis.
The iconic image of the Gansur is of a Scout Service tender with two
scout/couriers arranged nose-to-tail under each outrigger, although more
commonly the tender operates with cylindrical jump boats or smaller craft.
Subordinate vessels may cycle through a dock/refuel/depart sequence
allowing the tender to support far more craft than can be carried at once,
although this does require that non-jump-capable craft be conveyed to
the operations area by some means.

The command area is basic, consisting of a standard bridge and small
craft-operations room from which subordinate vessels are guided in
to dock and given departure routes that will not interfere with others.
Immediately aft of the bridge is a block of four cabins for the most
essential flight personnel. The remainder of the ship’s accommodation
is arranged in similar blocks interspersed with common areas, a mess
hall and a recreation chamber. Crew facilities are generous to allow long-
term deployments but divided up in such a way that part of the common-
area allocation can be repurposed for additional accommodation or
equipment without interfering with other common areas.

60

```
The Gansur is designed to be capable of a two-parsec jump with 400
tons of craft on its outriggers. Jump performance is not increased when
operating without craft, unlike maneuver capability. Internal fuel is
sufficient for two consecutive jumps or more commonly for a there-and-
back operation without refuelling. The additional 100 ton fuel tank is
intended to support craft operations but is constructed in such a way that
part or all of it can be converted to other uses.
```

```
This concept pervades the whole design philosophy of the Gansur.
Common areas can be converted to equipment or working spaces and
there is room for upgrades and alterations throughout the vessel. One
or more docking stations could fit with a 100-ton pod carrying mission-
critical systems or an extra fuel tank. There is also space to upgrade the
vessel’s very light armament. As standard, four single beam laser turrets
are carried as a deterrent and means of defending against minor attack.
Vessels taken into military service usually receive an upgrade to dual or
triple turrets and often gain additional weaponry.
```

```
The Gansur has considerably more power plant capacity than it requires.
The excess power is sometimes used to operate the systems of subordinate
vessels, allowing their own power plants to be shut down for maintenance.
Some variants and conversions make use of all excess power and may
even need to build an extra plant into one of the available spaces.

ROLES AND VARIANTS

The Gansur is commonly encountered supporting survey operations,
both privately and in Scout Service hands. The manufacturers make
much use of an image of a Gansur tender conveying four scout/couriers
to a central point from where they conduct charting or survey operations.
This can be effective, especially if several very distant points in the
system are to be mapped in detail. In this mode of operation, the tender
jumps to a central point and waits while the scouts make a microjump
to their designated operation area, carry out their mission, then return.
It may be possible to refuel the scouts at the tender, though capacity is
limited unless a supply vessel is available. Nevertheless, this technique
allows more efficient recharting of distant areas than deploying several
small ships. A similar method can be used to chart a cluster of worlds.
This is rarely done on an initial survey but follow-up and cartography-
updating missions are often carried out by a tender plus smaller vessels.

Tenders of this sort are also used to support interstellar communications
by minor governments and corporations. A tender stationed in a backwater
system can refuel couriers and send them on their way, keeping itself
topped up by using fuel shuttles skimming from a local gas giant. Where
communications need to be maintained across a rift, a common approach
is to send a tender to the midpoint of the route with a complement of
jump boats aboard, using these to set-up a cycle of replenishment and
refuelling, then use vessels ranging from the humble scout/courier to the
jump-4 Starstreak jump boat to maintain fast information transfer. A chain
of tenders could in theory be used to bridge a larger rift.

Some militaries use the Gansur as a support vessel for system defence
boats. A tender can carry two 200-ton SDBs on its outriggers, enabling
them to be positioned at a distant gas giant without a lengthy in-system
transit or quickly redeployed at need. One method of keeping notoriously
cramped SDBs on station without the crews suffering psychological
effects is to rotate crews through them every resupply mission, bringing
boats home for maintenance in a continuous cycle.

Tenders are also used as rescue or salvage ships, sometimes with
modifications to their grapples to allow a vessel of up to 400 tons to be
moved between star systems. This allows rescue of stranded vessels, that
cannot be repaired in situ, or salvage of whole wrecks. More commonly a
salvage tender will carry specialized pods on some of its grapples, with a
shuttle or two for approaching the wreck and a mobile workshop on others.

A similar approach is used by some prospecting or small-scale mining
companies, carrying seekers or other 100-ton craft on the outriggers to
cover a wide area. The tender allows the group to remain on station far
longer than a collection of prospecting craft and can carry a comprehensive
laboratory to investigate claims without endlessly running samples to a
port. Surface base modules can also be carried on the outriggers, allowing
a prospecting or small mining installation to be set up quickly and supported
in place using cargo pods once the base modules are delivered.

##### SALVAGE RIGHTS

```
Finding an abandoned starship can be extremely lucrative for Travellers
but there are many complications. In their rush to get aboard and see what
riches are to be found, Travellers may forget that ships are not abandoned
lightly and if no-one else has found the wreck there must be a reason.
```

```
Interstellar salvage law varies from one polity to another but most
systems agree that someone who finds a completely abandoned vessel
has certain rights to it. This is not the same thing as the wreck becoming
the property of whoever boards it first; there are legal processes that
must be followed in order to have legitimate salvage rights.
```

```
Of course, the Travellers could just bypass the niceties and strip the
wreck for what they can sell but this sort of illegal salvage operation
brings its own problems. Starship components have identifying tracers
built into their structure, so if the Travellers start selling bits of a ship
reported missing, they will sooner or later have to account for how they
came by the components. At best this means fines for illegal salvage and
if they attract the attention of anti-piracy agencies the Travellers may be
in for a bad time.
```

OWNERSHIP

```
AND SALVAGE RIGHTS
In order to conduct legal salvage work, salvage rights must be assigned.
The simplest situation is where the legal owners of a vessel contract a
salvage vessel to carry out work on their behalf. This is clear-cut and
free from legal entanglements, and whilst providing steady income from
contract work without much risk. It is not particularly lucrative however,
as salvage crews are usually paid a modest fee to conduct work on
behalf of the owners.
```

```
In this situation the salvagers can expect a fee of no more than 0.1%
of the ship’s current value. This assumes the vessel is in a condition
where it is feasable that it will be repaired and returned to service, or
has sufficient working components to be useful in repairing or refitting
other ships. A vessel with drives and power plant that could be returned
to service would meet these criteria even if the rest of the ship was
completely trashed, since these expensive components could be used
to replace systems aboard a similar vessel.
```

```
This situation assumes the vessel’s operators still have legal ownership.
There is a common misconception that abandoning a ship creates a
free-for-all situation and it becomes the property of whomever comes
```

```
65
```

along next. This is not always the case; a vessel temporarily evacuated
remains the property of its operators until someone proves in court
that the abandonment has become permanent. This can be a lengthy
process, as most ship operators will fight to retain their assets even if
they are drifting around a distant star system with nobody aboard.

There are certain conditions that make the process of obtaining salvage
rights much simpler. If the craft has been abandoned longer than a
standard year or is demonstrated to be ‘impractical to reoccupy’ then
it will normally be declared salvageable. Impractical to reoccupy could
refer to the wreck’s location or condition, and may be subject to legal
wrangling. However, in this case salvage rights will normally be assigned
within a few days to anyone who can prove they have been aboard the
wreck and are capable of salvaging it.

Salvage rights rarely come free. Normally there is a fee of around 0.01%
of the vessel’s estimated value, part of which goes to the original owners.
Once the fee is paid, the Travellers will have exclusive salvage rights
to that particular vessel. Enforcement of rights can be problematic but
in well-policed systems a beacon declaring salvage work in progress is
often sufficient. There are always those who will try to slip aboard and
grab what they can, however.

Salvage rights grant the Travellers permission to strip whatever they
can from the wreck and use or sell it. Around 10% of the proceeds from
salvage are payable to the original owners unless the salvagers buy
all rights, which costs more than the fee noted previously, or there are
circumstances that negate ownership. For example, if a vessel is lost due
to the proven gross negligence of its owners, they cannot profit from its
salvage. In the case where an insurance company or similar underwriter
has paid out to the owners, the insurer is now the owner and is entitled
to the same percentage of salvage.

In the case of military vessels, private salvage rights are only ever granted
to firms that have a good relationship with the owning force and salvage
is normally conducted on behalf of the owners rather than on a freelance
for-profit basis. Even if salvage rights are granted, some components are
off-limits. The military will usually pay a good price to have weapons and
electronic systems returned and vigorously pursue those who try to keep
components for their own use or to sell them.

RE-REGISTERING

Salvage rights do not convey ownership of the vessel as a going concern.
In order to operate a salvaged vessel (legally, at least) it is necessary
to re-register it and pass a set of spaceworthiness inspections. This is
usually a rigorous process but some ports are notorious for their laxity.
This may be simple negligence or could be a deliberate policy to attract

66

```
67
```

business or conceal criminal activity such as bringing pirated vessels
back into service.

The salvaged vessel must first be returned to a spaceworthy condition.
The usual approach is to obtain components from other salvaged
wrecks, only buying new what cannot be found elsewhere. Once the
vessel is ready the process can begin. Done properly, re-registration
spaceworthiness checks are extremely thorough, requiring hours of
diagnostics and a series of dockside and space trials. A skilled team
can complete the checks in two to three days, usually charging a fee
equivalent to 0.2% of the ship’s estimated value. A far trader returned
to reasonable condition and estimated to be worth MCr25 would cost
Cr50000 for a proper set of checks.

It is almost inevitable these checks will highlight many defects, hopefully
minor ones. Repairing them will impose further costs but a couple of
rounds of retesting is normally included in the original fee. Once the ship
is declared fit for space the legal details of registry can be competed –
this will usually cost about 0.005% of the ship’s original (new-built) cost.
For a far trader this is another Cr1250 or so.

There are ports where this process can be expedited – a euphemism for
‘not carried out properly’ – and done on the cheap. For a bribe between
10-40% of the normal fee, certain port officials will issue the appropriate
certification and the Travellers can be on their way immediately. Reputable
ports will regard such documentation as questionable however, creating
the possibility of undergoing repeats of the spaceworthiness tests on
the orders of a more responsible port official. These checks may find
problems the original one simply ignored, grounding the ship or requiring
more bribery to get moving again.

SALVAGE VALUE

Bringing in a distressed vessel (such as one that has lost power or has
had to be evacuated due to an environment control issue) will typically
net the Travellers a fee equivalent to 0.1% of the ship’s new value. This
is a ‘rescue fee’ and does not confer salvage rights. If a ship is to be
salvaged, the Travellers will need to berth it somewhere. Most major ports
will not allow Travellers to tie up a landing dock whilst they dismantle a
starship but smaller installations may be willing to rent out space.

Renting space, along with access to normal starport services and the
occasional borrowed toolkit, costs the ship’s tonnage in Credits, per
week. This may be more than standard berthing fees since the port is
not making any money from trade or other economic activity on the part
of the vessel. Sometimes a port operator will increase the price once the
Travellers cannot easily leave and bargaining is always an option.

The salvage value of a vessel or its components depends on a number
of factors; age, wear, maintenance and of course whatever happened to

68

```
make the ship derelict. The Salvage Value table gives an indication of the
salvage value based upon the original cost of the ship. Roll 2D and apply
the following modifiers.
```

- For every 10 full years of the ship’s age at the time it was abandoned:
    DM+1
- For every 25 years the wreck has been abandoned: DM+1
- If the ship has had a proper cycle of annual maintenance and periodic
    refits: DM-2
- If the ship was mildly neglected (this often applies to vessels that are
    not part of a formal shipping line, such as free traders): DM+2
- If the ship was neglected during its lifetime: DM+4
- If the ship was very much neglected: DM+6
- If the vessel was a ‘coffin ship’; barely spaceworthy and improperly
    maintained: DM+8

```
In addition, the Referee should impose a DM ranging from +0 to +10
depending on the severity of the incident that caused abandonment.
It is unlikely (unless someone has been tricked) that anyone would
abandon ship without conditions at least worth DM+2. Moderate combat
or collision damage implies DM+4; serious damage DM+6. A vessel that
was reduced to little more than a hulk would be worth DM+8. DM+10
applies to ships that have been shot almost to splinters.
```

```

12-15 10+2D%
16-18 5+1D%
19-21 1D%
22+ D3%
```

```
For example, the Travellers find the wreck of a subsidized merchant. The
vessel was 30 years old when she suffered a serious incident and was
lost. Her condition at the time was typical of an independent merchant
ship – slightly run down but with regular-ish maintenance. This adds up
to DM+5. The vessel suffered a serious internal fire and systems failure
but is structurally more or less intact. The Referee imposes DM+3 for
this, for a total of DM+8.
```

```
Rolling 2D, the Referee gets a result of 5; plus 8, this gives 13 – the
salvage value of the wreck is 10+2D%. The Referee rolls an 8, so the
wreck has a nominal salvage value of 18% its original cost. If everything
```

```
69
```

aboard the wreck could be salvaged and sold it would net the Travellers
over MCr16! However, this is a nominal value. What the Travellers
actually get depends on how much work they are willing to put in.

MAKING MONEY

The quickest way to make money on a salvaged ship is to sell it to a
breaker or someone who wants to strip the wreck – or perhaps eventually
return it to service. A breaker will typically offer 5% of the ship’s salvage
value or half that if the vessel is not brought to their yard by the Travellers.
This may seem low but in the case above it would still net the Travellers
Cr800000 or so, for the trouble of finding a wreck and getting it to a
breaker’s yard. The latter can be difficult, especially if the ship has to be
towed but this is still quick and relatively easy money.

Alternatively, the Travellers can break the ship themselves and sell off
the parts. This will be a slow process, since it requires finding someone
who wants to buy specific ship parts that may or may not be in good
condition. A breaker can afford to take years over this, probably ending
up with a hulk that still has parts they will never be able to sell. Travellers,
by definition, tend to have other things to do. It might be possible to make
a deal with a breaker, such that the Travellers get a percentage of sale
price in return for the breaker hosting the wreck and handling inspection
and business transactions.

The alternative is to rip out whatever can be easily accessed and take it
somewhere for sale. This approach is quick-and-dirty and often causes
damage to components as others are removed. What is left becomes
increasingly worthless after each quick plundering for useable parts. In
each case a single Engineer check is made at Average (8+) difficulty by
the Traveller overseeing the salvage operation. The Effect of this check
determines the value of components salvaged and reduction in value of
what remains. The more quickly salvage work is done, the more damage
is done getting valuable components out.

Quick Pillage is a tongue-in-cheek term for grabbing the most valuable
components and ripping them out. One person can quick pillage 100
tons of ship in one day. Quick Pillage yields D3% of salvage value per
point of Effect and reduces the value of the remainder by four times
as much.

Hurried Salvage takes four times as long as a Quick Pillage. It yields
1D% of salvage value per point of Effect and reduces the value of the
remainder by twice as much.

Careful Salvage takes 10 times as long as a Quick Pillage. It yields
2D% of salvage value per point of Effect and reduces the value of the
remainder by as much.

70

```
For example, the wreck of a subsidized merchant has a salvage value of
MCr16. The Travellers make a Quick Pillage of the salables, getting an
Effect of 2 on their Engineer check. This is worth D3% per point of Effect;
the Travellers roll an impressive 6 and manage to pull Cr960000 worth of
high-value components out of the wreck, reducing its value by four times
that (MCr3.84) in addition to the value of salvage they removed. The
total reduction in value of the wreck is MCr4.8. There is MCr11.2 worth of
useable salvage still aboard.
```

```
The value of salvaged components is nominal. That is to say, the
Travellers might manage to sell them to someone who really needs those
parts for more or might end up taking less for them in order to get some
quick cash. If the Travellers use salvage to fix-up a ship that needed
repairing, its nominal value can be counted towards the cost of repairs.

##### GROUND VEHICLE

UNIFIED MOBILE SOLUTIONS

F-500 FIELD POWER UNIT

Unified Mobile Solutions is a specialist company producing heavy
vehicles designed to support field operations of construction, mining and
similar heavy-industry companies. The primary purpose of this vehicle is
to put a mobile fusion reactor wherever it is needed. Its own power plant
gives it effectively infinite range and heavy tracked suspension can cross
most terrain. The F-500 is fully sealed against vacuum and has an airlock
for operating in hazardous environments.

The cab is spacious and doubles as a working area, with both driving seats
swivelling around to give access to a bank of sensors and instruments.
These, like the crane on top of the vehicle, are intended to assist a project
once the vehicle is in situ. The crane is occasionally used to rescue other
vehicles or reposition equipment but for the most part the F-500 acts as a
command center and brain, sitting at the center of a web of power take-off
cables feeding everything from lights to heavy earthmoving equipment.

Behind the cab is a small living area with bunks for up to eight people,
a galley and fresher. There is seating of accommodation for personnel
other than the two crew but this area allows the F-500 to provide support
to crews of other vehicles who would otherwise require living quarters
to be provided. The bunk area is sometimes converted
into a more comfortable living area for the crew,
essentially turning the F-500 into an
extremely upmarket ATV with an
infinite range.

##### CHARIOTS OF FIRE

```
Location : Any mid-tech balkanised world with a breathable atmosphere.
```

```
The Travellers are sent to steal a pair of fire engines seized by a
neighboring government and bring them back across the border safely.
```

```
BACKGROUND
Castica and Handor are two small countries on a mid-tech balkanised
world. Both have about 250,000 inhabitants, Law Level 6 and TL6. Both
border on and are economically dwarfed by Amit, a larger nation that
dominates the region.
```

```
Handor is ruled by a military junta, supported by wealthy aristocratic
landowners. Castica suffered a revolution a couple of years ago when
the ruling dictator was overthrown and a democratic government gained
power. The new government is not popular in Handor and Amit since it
passed laws detrimental to foreign investment, causing great financial
loss in these countries. Border incidents have increased in recent months.
```

```
A couple of years before the revolution, Handor and Castica jointly
formed a special fire-fighting unit, equipped – at great expense – to
handle complicated urban or industrial fires. The unit was better than
either country could have afforded individually. It was stationed in Azacul,
the capital of Handor but could operate freely in both countries. The
capitals of Handor and Castica are only 10 kilometers apart, with a good
road connecting them, so the arrangement was mutually beneficial – at
least until recently. A week ago, the government of Handor nationalised
the unit, expelled all the unit’s Castican personnel and prohibited it from
crossing the border.
```

```
THE SITUATION
As the Travellers pass through Jaco, Castica’ s capital, they are
approached by a major of Castica’s military intelligence. He explains,
in a refreshingly forthright manner, that his country needs the help of
outsiders. He will tell the Travellers about the advanced fire engines
his nation half-owns, mentioning that people could die if they are not
available. Since Handor will not be reasonable about the joint firefighting
force, his government has been forced to take action.
```

```
He offers the Travellers Cr50000 if they will steal two advanced fire
engines from Handor’s capital and bring them to Jaco. The border is
about midway between the cities, so the transportation part will be

straightforward. Timing might be more of an issue, however. In 10 days,
the Castican president will make an official visit to Handor to discuss the
problems between the two nations. A faction of the Castican government
expects the discussion to be unsuccessful and has decided to try to
stage a propaganda coup. The Travellers’ task is to steal the two vehicles
the night after the president’s departure from Handor.

There are several conditions to the mission. The vehicles must be in
usable condition when they get across the border. Minor damage is
acceptable but the Travellers will receive a 5% bonus for each vehicle
delivered totally undamaged. If only one vehicle is recovered, they will be
paid half the promised amount. If the Travellers kill or injure anyone, or if
they are caught or killed, Castica will deny any involvement.

The elite firefighting unit consists of two vehicles with 30 meter ladders
and two vehicles with 12 cubic meter foam tanks and sophisticated
protective equipment for the firemen. All trucks are capable of 120
kilometers per hour, have a range of 150 kilometers and are painted a
high visibility yellow.

The vehicles are stationed in the Azacul main fire station, situated in
the outskirts of the city. The station consists of two buildings; a main
one containing six ordinary fire engines and quarters for their crews, and
a secondary building containing the engines and crews’ quarters. The
doors and windows of both buildings are equipped with burglar alarms.
The Castican patron will supply the players with blueprints of the station
and maps of the capital and the surrounding countryside.

The border between Castica and Handor is crossed by the inter-capital
road and several small roads of low quality. The border crossings are all
guarded by the Handorian paramilitary border police and the Castican
army. The border police are equipped with TL6 infantry weapons and
somewhat trigger-happy. They should be treated with care, although they
can be bribed if the offer is large enough and made with proper diplomacy.

The Castican army is also very jumpy and need to be carefully handled.
Since the government is not officially involved, the army cannot be
informed ahead of time. It would be unfortunate if the vehicles got safely
to the border, before being destroyed in a firefight...

**Firefighting Vehicles**
Any vehicle can carry portable firefighting gear to be used by personnel
when they get to the danger area. It is also possible to create an expedient
fire truck by improvising mountings for portable gear on a utility vehicle.
Both options are cheap and reasonably effective for small fires but for
major conflagrations a dedicated firefighting vehicle is necessary.

76

```
Additional Traits
Fire and rescue work involves three main areas of activity; saving
lives, extinguishing fires and dealing with related hazards such as
dangerous chemicals.
```

```
Fire and Rescue: This trait turns a vehicle into a basic firefighting vehicle
using water either from its own internal reserve or a source such as local
hydrants. At low Tech Levels equipment is extremely limited in capability
but still much better than the hand-held equipment available. A standard
Fire and Rescue vehicle of any Tech Level cannot deal with chemical
vapour or spills, other than to spray water at them and hope for the best.
```

```
Advanced Fire and Rescue: An Advanced Fire and Rescue vehicle
carries equipment for dealing with a range of hazards including chemical
fires and spills. In addition to being able to put large quantities of water
down on a fire, an Advanced Fire and Rescue vehicle has a tank of
suppressant foam that will put out fires that water will simply spread
around. The foam also has limited chemical neutralization properties and
will contain most chemicals or biological hazards.
```

```
Hazardous Fire and Rescue: A Hazardous Fire And Rescue vehicle
has all the capabilities of an Advanced Fire and Rescue vehicle plus
resistance to hazards that would overwhelm a lesser vehicle. Tyres are
chemical-resistant and the cab has a protection system that maintains
a slight overpressure, keeping chemical agents out, providing the crew
use only the dedicated hostile-environment airlock system. A battery of
detectors and processing equipment allows agents to be identified and
threat levels assessed. In addition to water and foam the Hazardous Fire
And Rescue vehicle can also deliver neutralising chemicals by spray,
diluted in water via its hoses, or by means of a small mortar-like device
that lobs canisters above a chemical fire. These can be filled with various
neutralising agents but the standard mix is useful against a range of
industrial and spacecraft-associated chemicals as well as reacting with
air in a highly endothermic manner. Essentially, these crystals pull the
heat out of a fire and may even extinguish it on their own.
```

```
77
```

**Vehicle Modifications**
The modifications presented here can be applied to a variety of vehicles,
so the cost per Space is given as a multiplier rather than an addition. Apply
all additions (such as rough terrain modifications) before multiplying to
get the final cost of the vehicle.

Fire and Rescue: A fire and rescue vehicle is designed for the purpose.
It adds pumps and hoses, stowage for individual firefighting, breathing
and rescue equipment and a degree of heatproofing to protect the crew
and equipment carried aboard.

Tech Level: 4
Cost per Space: x1.2
Traits: Fire and Rescue

Advanced Fire and Rescue: In addition to fire and rescue equipment,
the Advanced Fire and Rescue modification adds suppressant foam and
a greater variety of hand-held equipment.

Tech Level: 7
Cost per Space: x1.5
Traits: Advanced Fire and Rescue

Hazardous Fire and Rescue: In addition to advanced fire and rescue
equipment, the Hazardous Fire and Rescue modification adds chemical
agent detection and environmental protection for the crew as well as
the capability to tackle chemical spills and fires beyond the capability of
standard vehicles.

Tech Level: 7
Cost per Space: x2
Traits: Hazardous Fire and Rescue

Suppressant Tanks: Sufficient foam or water to allow one attempt at
control or suppression – which might mean several minutes of hosing
or a period of setting up followed by a targeted foam burst – takes up
eight Spaces and costs Cr4000. Multiple tanks can be combined into
one or more larger tanks.

Rescue Ladder: An extendable ladder on a swivel turntable, supported
by heavy structural reinforcement and a set of deployable stabilizers.
A vehicle may carry a ladder 10 meters long plus five meters for every
10 Spaces it has. Each 10 meter section of ladder uses up four Spaces
inside the vehicle. Cost is Cr1000 per meter.

78

HAZARDOUS ENVIRONMENT

```
FIRE ENGINE
Two of the advanced firefighting vehicles based at Jaco are designed
to tackle industrial or complex urban fires, and equipped to deal with
chemical hazards as well as more conventional fires. They are built on
a large, heavy ground vehicle chassis of a conventional design – cab
and crew compartment at the front with the power plant behind and foam
tanks at the rear. Although a large vehicle, the fire engine is built for high
acceleration and the ability to cross rough or debris-strewn ground. It
is tricky to drive at speed under these conditions, so drivers normally
receive enhanced training.
```

```
Two crewmembers drive the vehicle and operate its systems but can
dismount and join their colleagues, leaving the vehicle to automatically
provide updates on hotspots, chemical content of smoke and new
hazards via the crew intercom system.

an obstruction to create an escape bridge. The vehicle is as fast and

although without the advanced life support features.

```
TOWING SHIPS
The concept of salvage work often conjures up images of grubby ships
operating on the fringes of the law. That does happen but the salvage
and rescue field is much broader than many Travellers imagine. There
are opportunities to make good – and honorable – money as well as
some very murky areas a crew might delve into.
```

```
Large Class A and B starports maintain a flotilla of tugs and rescue craft,
or at least vessels that can carry out these roles at need. A ship getting
into distress close to such a port need only transmit a request and wait
for assistance. The port operators will charge a fee for a rescue but often
this is covered by a ship’s insurance. Even if it is not, being rescued at
your own expense is a lot better than not being rescued at all.
```

```
If the problem is something that can be fixed aboard the distressed
vessel, a repair crew will usually be dispatched to deal with the matter. It
may be necessary to bring spares or new components from the port but
this is straightforward. A ship that has developed a more serious problem
will have to be towed in, which is a rather more difficult process.
```

```
Lesser starports may not have a dedicated rescue tug. If so, it will be
necessary to use whatever craft are available. This may mean improvising
towing gear. A similar situation arises if the Travellers find a derelict craft
or want to help someone under conditions where it is necessary to move
the distressed vessel elsewhere.
```

```
RESCUE FEES
Rescue work can be quite lucrative, although there is no way to predict
when a job will come along. It may be months before a ship needs help,
so most rescue vessels either operate on a contract whereby they accept
a reduced fee in return for a regular income, or they carry out other work
until required. For example, a salvage and rescue vessel could conduct
repair work on the local starport or other installations until it is needed.
```

```
Generally speaking, the fee for rescuing a craft that is totally disabled –
whether that means it requires major repairs in place or has to be towed
to safety – is calculated at 0.1% of its current value. For example, if
a brand-new a 600-ton subsidized liner (worth MCr161.523) suffered a
drive failure, the salvage crew who brought it into dock could expect a fee
of Cr161523, likely rounded off to the nearest Cr10000.
```

```
This can vary considerably, however, especially where there is only one
possible rescue ship and the rescuers feel like negotiating. Conversely,
```

```
83
```

some starport operators offer a rescue service for free, feeling that
increased confidence among spacers will bring in more ships and thus
produce revenue in other ways.

The rescue fee is one reason why captains are reluctant to declare an
emergency. A smaller fee, usually a fraction of the complete-rescue fee,
is payable for assistance with lesser emergencies. Salvage and rescue
teams sometimes compete with one another for the right to make a
rescue. This can mean undercutting fees, racing to get to the distressed
vessel before a competitor or all manner of other shenanigans. An
unwary rescuee might find they are being towed to the wrong destination
by a bunch of yahoos whilst the neatly-uniformed starport salvage team
curses them on the radio. Salvage teams have even been known to start
shooting at one another whilst they have a distressed ship in tow.

TAKING A CRAFT UNDER TOW

Taking another vessel under tow is not an easy process. The first
challenge is attaching tow lines; many, but by no means all, vessels have
attachment points that make the job a little easier but it is still necessary
to get the lines to the distressed vessel. This requires someone to jump
from one ship to the other or use a remotely operated attachment drone.
If the target craft is tumbling, there is a real danger of being swatted away
or crushed. Once cables are attached, towing can begin but this is not a
simple task.

Attaching Tow Lines
Jumping across to attach tow lines, or sending a drone, is an Average
(8+) task, using Vacc Suit or Electronics (remote ops) skill. A tumbling
ship increases the difficulty to Difficult (10+) and if the attempt is failed
the Traveller or drone will be knocked away. For a drone under power,
this simply requires getting it back under control but a Traveller might be
in more trouble. Thrust pistols and EVA (Extra-Vehicular Activity) packs
allow the Traveller to halt their motion and try again, requiring only a Vacc
Suit check. Without such equipment the Traveller will drift off into space
unless tethered to their ship, in which case they may end up banging into
it as their tether swings them around.

If the target craft is tumbling quickly, the difficulty increases to Very
Difficult (12+) and anyone failing the check takes a number of damage
dice equal to the negative Effect. Drones are simply destroyed.

Once on the hull, cables must be attached. If the vessel has attachment
points this is straightforward enough. If not, it may be necessary to
improvise an attachment point by cutting hullplate. To improvise an
attachment point, a Difficult (10+) Mechanic check is necessary. Failure
does not indicate the cable cannot be attached; instead the Effect of
the check is used to determine how good the cable fix is. This may not
become apparent until towing begins.

84

```
Towing
It is not necessary to have excess Thrust available to tow another ship.
Any amount of thrust is sufficient to eventually effect a change in velocity
and, in any case, harsh acceleration is best avoided. When towing
another craft, the combined mass of both vessels is used to determine
acceleration. A 100-ton tug with Thrust 4 can make 4g acceleration when
unladen but when towing a 400-ton subsidized merchant its acceleration
will be greatly reduced. The simplest way to calculate this is:
```

```
Multiply the towing vessel’s Thrust by its Tonnage. Divide the result by
the combined Tonnage of both vessels.
```

```
In the example above, this comes out as 400 divided by 500 or 0.8g. This
is entirely sufficient for most circumstances, although if a ship has to be
rescued quickly or dragged out of a steep gravity well it may be beneficial
to use more than one tug.
```

```
By way of example, if three 100-ton, Thrust 4 tugs were towing a 2,000-
ton ship, their combined towing power would be (100x4)x3, or 1,200. This
is divided by the total mass of all ships, (2,300 tons), to give 0.5217g.
```

```
Assuming the tow line holds, getting another craft moving is not all that
difficult. The problem is that it will not stop moving. If the craft under tow
had operable drives the problem would be a lot easier – but then the
craft would not require towing! If the towed craft does not have operable
drives it will continue to move in a straight line when not being pulled by
```

```
85
```

the towing ship. This could result in the towed vessel being lost in deep
space, crashing into the starport or a nearby ship, or helplessly plunging
into the gravity well of a world or star. More immediately, a towing vessel
will pull the target ship towards it. If it then slows down, the craft on tow
will smash into it from behind.

When any change to course or speed is made, including getting the
towed craft moving, a Difficult (10+) Pilot check is necessary. The Effect
of the tow line attachment is applied as a DM to this check, as is the
Thrust of the towing ship. This is not a measure of how much power can
be applied, as such, but of the finesse with which the throttle can be used
to increase or decrease the tension in the tow line. An additional DM-2 is
applied if using an improvised tow line attachment.

If the check is failed by -6 or more, the tow line parts, possibly pulling
something off one or both ships. In addition, both vessels suffer damage
equal to the negative Effect of the failure. Success indicates the direction
or speed change is performed without hazard. Note that slowing down a
towed vessel can be done by carefully moving around it so that the tug
is effectively pulling it backwards. This can cause a towed vessel to turn
around but if done gently it is not a major problem. Violent deceleration
or changes of direction can cause the towed vessel to whip around on
the end of the tow line and, in the worst-case scenario, the two ships may
begin whirling round and round one another, linked by a cable that may
or may not snap.

To avoid problems of this sort, towing ships rarely use full thrust. Changing
speed or direction at less than 0.1g imposes no additional problems. For
each full 0.1g applied, DM-1 is imposed on all Pilot checks. Normally
towing operations are extremely gentle but in a crisis it may be necessary
to apply thrust and hope for the best.

When towing in a gravity well, a varying DM applies:

```
Gravity Well DM
Size Code or Type DM
1-3 -1
4-6 -2
7-9 -3
A+ -4
Small Gas Giant -5
```

```
Large Gas Giant -6
Main Sequence Star -8
Giant or Neutron Star -10
```

86

```
The Referee should note that these are simple modifiers and that
gravitational force drops off with the square of distance. Thus DMs should
only be applied at close orbital distances. The DM can be halved (drop
fractions) further away. A vessel close enough to a star to be suffering
towing penalties will be receiving a lot of stellar radiation and heat, and
may have quite a variety of additional problems.
```

```
Towing Equipment: A set of heavy-duty towing cables and the means to
attach them costs Cr500 per ton of hull. This includes emergency release
mechanisms and attachment points that will withstand greater forces
than the cable itself. Retraction equipment is also included in the cost,
along with attachment blocks for use on the ship to be towed. The strain
required to break a cable of this sort is immense, so if thrust is used very
gently the tension in the cable will be insufficient to damage it.
```

```
However, sudden increases in tension can snap the cable or rip it from its
mountings. This may occur where a towing ship accelerates hard with a
slack cable, which suddenly pulls tight, or when violent course changes
are attempted. To avoid breaking the cable under such conditions, make
an Average (8+) Pilot check with DM-1 per 0.1g of acceleration being
applied, and an additional DM-1 for each multiple of the towing ship’s
tonnage the towed ship has.
```

```
For example, 5,000-ton navy destroyer is trying to tow a 20,000-ton
logistics ship out of a battle zone. The pilot fails to take up the slack gently
enough and the cable becomes taut. The pilot tries to avoid snapping the
cable but needs to make an Average (8+) Pilot check with DM-4 since
the ship being towed is four times the tonnage of the destroyer. For a
100-ton tug the multiple would be 200 times and with such an immense
DM it is obvious that the towing cable will simply part. Fortunately, tug
pilots are good at remembering to ease the slack up ever so gently.
```

```
Attachment Drone: Attachment drones can be used to carry a cable to
a distressed ship and fix it to an attachment point. They cannot improvise
an attachment but creative Travellers might cling to the drone and be
carried to the target point. A drone can be launched through a missile
launcher or manually from an airlock. Each drone allows one attempt
(successful or not) to attach a set of towing cables. Drones cost Cr5000
each and 10 consume half a ton as cargo.
```

```
87
```

TOWING POD

A towing pod is a remotely controlled 10-ton craft equipped with a
powerful maneuver drive and high-capacity batteries to power it, along
with a primary drive unit and manoeuvring clusters. The pod can be used
to move a towed craft very slowly or apply braking and turning thrust
to a vessel under tow with cables. Pods of this sort are often used in
shipbuilding and repair yards, and occasionally by criminals intent on
stealing objects – including starships – in space.

A 10-ton pod towing a 100-ton ship can manage a maximum of 0.273g.
This is quite enough for slow repositioning within a shipyard but probably
not sufficient for salvage work even with quiet modest ships. Thus
either multiple pods will be used – if available – or a conventional tow
undertaken with assistance from the pod.

## TRAVELLINGTRAVELLING

##### CALL OUT THE GUARD

```
Security forces exist in almost every society. Organization can vary
considerably, as does equipment and even the role of a security force can
diverge. In general, however, security forces have three main purposes:
```

```
•  To protect the citizens of their home society.
•  To uphold the laws of their home society.
•  To ensure the stability of their home society.
```

```
These duties are inter-related but emphasis can shift depending on the
nature of society and its leaders. Often preserving the stability of the
culture translates to oppressing the masses and ensuring they do not
launch a revolution but occasionally security forces will remove a bad
ruler in the name of the people. Much depends on the character of the
people involved.
```

```
Travellers are likely to come into contact with local security forces
at the starport, after which they may have interactions if they break
the law or need to interact with local officials. There is a correlation
between local Law Level and the amount of bureaucracy encountered
when trying to obtain permits or other security-related paperwork but
the trustworthiness and competence of the security force are generally
independent of Law Level.
```

```
Most security forces operate on a three-tier basis, with different equipment
and response techniques at each level.
```

```
Routine personnel undertake most normal tasks such as standing guard,
patrolling an area, carrying out customs searches and the like. Routine
personnel tend to be equipped for the possibility of trouble, such as a
patrol officer carrying a sidearm, perhaps with access to more powerful
weapons at need.
```

```
Response personnel are equipped to support their routine colleagues
with heavy firepower or specialist capabilities. In a society that has
considerable numbers of psions, this might mean the possession of
psionic shielding equipment or personnel may be psionically adept in
their own right.
```

```
Elite personnel are equipped as best as possible for the worst
situations. These may be heavy elements of the ruler’s personal
guard or a specialist security formation, perhaps even a ‘bodyguard’
regiment of the planetary army.
```

```
91
```

A security force will usually have some sort of investigative branch. This
may be in the form of attached officials or a dedicated investigative/
detective branch. For example, a starport security service might have its
own customs experts but need to borrow criminal detectives, accountants
or forensics experts from planetside law enforcement. If expert personnel
are not available the local authorities must simply do as best they can.

Not all security forces are armed. If private citizens are permitted to own
weapons, it is common for those who police them to have access to at
least the same level of equipment. This is not always the case, however.
At the beginning of the 20th Century it was normal for many British citizens
to own firearms w but this was not seen as making it necessary to arm the
constabulary. Indeed, officials are recorded as stating that if a police officer
needed a weapon he could simply borrow one from a passing gentleman –
this actually happened during at least one major shots-fired incident!

ORGANISATION AND SIZE

Security organizations vary considerably in size and may or may not be
formally organised. Generally speaking, richer and larger societies tend
to have more formal security arrangements; small communities may rely
on part-time officials or a posse of concerned citizens. To determine the
level of organization a given world’s security force has, roll 2D on the
Organization table, with the following modifiers:

Population 3-: DM-2
Population 6+: DM+1
Population 8+: DM+3

Law Level 0: -4
Law Level 1-3: -1
Law Level 6-8: +1
Law Level 9+: +3

Organization

```
2D + Modifiers Size and Organization Multiplier
0 No security force 0
1-3 Small, part-time security force 0.2
4-6 Small professional security force 0.4
7-9 Modest-sized professional security force 1
10-12 Large professional security force 1.5
13-15 Huge professional security force 2.5
16+ Enormous security force 5
```

92

```
A planetside security force will normally have one officer for every 500
citizens (based upon the planet’s Population code), plus an administrative
and command staff who do not carry out routine patrol and security
work. A major facility such as a starport tends to have more personnel,
depending on the amount of traffic it receives. The figure of 250 security
personnel for a Class A port and 100 for a Class B installation can serve
as a starting point rather basing them on the Population code.
```

```
The multiplier from the
Organization table modifies
this figure. Thus a world with
a population of 10,000 and a
small professional security force
will have 20 security personnel
modified by the multiplier of
0.4. This gives a figure of just
eight security personnel for the
whole population. Most of the
time this force will be adequate,
equivalent to a sheriff and a
handful of deputies for a small
city. However, it is difficult to
provide specialist expertise with
a force this small.
```

```
A part-time security force will have
very few professional members,
if any. Instead it will rely on
local responses that may or
may not be mandated by law
or custom. For example,
a small port might have
one part-time security
official – who might be the
port authority director or a
designated individual who has
a job of their own. In the event
of trouble, this person leads
a response cobbled together
from local shopkeepers’ security
guards, concerned citizens, and
any tough-looking drunks who can
be rounded up from the local bars.
```

```
93
```

A professional force will usually have a uniform and issued equipment,
although this can be scanty. A low-budget force may be equipped only
with an armband and a cheap pistol, backed-up by whatever the members
can provide themselves. Such a force may still be well organised and
highly competent, although its members will have to contend with the
poor impression their equipment tends to make.

To determine the level of funding a force has, roll 2D on the Funding
table, with the following modifiers:

Class E Starport or Population 2-: -2
Class D Starport or Population 4-: -1
Class B Starport or Population 7+: +1
Class A Starport or Population 9+: +2

```

A force with no significant funding relies on whatever its members can
provide or donations from helpful citizens. Equipment tends to be eclectic
and random. Other levels of funding determine the equipment a typical
officer will have and also the proportion of routine, response and elite
personnel. Note that personnel who are equipped to a response or even
elite level may sometimes be encountered undertaking routine work. For
example, a crisis response unit might wear the same uniform and work
alongside customs officials, only donning heavy armor when necessary.

To determine the equipment of a secure force, roll 2D and apply the
Equipment DM from the Funding table.

94

```
Equipment
2D + Equipment DM Equipment Level
0- None provided
1-3 Minimal
4-6 Basic
7-9 Standard
10-12 Well Equipped
13-15 Heavily Equipped
16+ Lavishly Equipped
```

```
Equipment will be provided at the local Tech Level for planetside forces
and a minimum of TL8 for personnel at an orbital starport or similar
installation. Response personnel are equipped one category higher and
elite personnel are equipped two categories higher.
```

```
Minimal Equipment typically means a cheap sidearm, minimal
ammunition and a few necessary items such as a flashlight and handcuffs.
Minimally equipped personnel usually lack ‘official’ communications
equipment, although they may have their own.
```

```
Basic Equipment typically means a standard sidearm and necessary
tools such as flashlight, communications equipment and hand-held
instruments if the Tech Level permits.
```

```
Standard Equipment means a sidearm, a full set of law enforcement
tools, good communications equipment with access to data-transfer
capability (if Tech Level permits) and light body armor. Personnel may
have access to additional weapons such as a shotgun in a patrol vehicle.
```

```
Well-Equipped indicates personnel have good body armor and
personal weapons, with access to heavier weaponry including possibly
light automatics (submachineguns or assault rifles) and specialist
weapons such as sniper rifles. These may not be carried all the time but
be kept in an accessible location.
```

```
Heavily Equipped indicates plentiful supplies of all equipment noted
previously, some or all of which is of a Tech Level 1-2 above local. A
heavily equipped security force may have access to military grade
combat armor for some elite units.
```

```
Lavishly Equipped indicates very high quality equipment that may be 3-4
Tech Levels above local if appropriate. A heavily equipped security force
will have access to military grade combat armor for some response units
and may even have a battle dress equipped unit if the Tech Level permits.
```

```
95
```

COMPETENCE

A security organization might be extremely well-equipped but incapable
of carrying out basic functions, or extremely skilled and dedicated but
lacking the tools to get the job done. The Competence of a security
service refers to its ability to coordinate an operation, spot discrepancies
and act upon them, and avoid letting wrongdoers slip away due to basic
errors. Competence is also used as a guide when a security service
brings charges against someone – an incompetent service might leave
loopholes, misplace key evidence or otherwise derail its own activities.
A low Competence rating does not indicate personnel crash their cars,
drop their weapons and fall over like Keystone Kops... at least usually. It
does have the potential to make the service a laughing stock, however.

This is determined by rolling 2D on the Competence table, with the
following modifiers.

Part-time Security Service: -4
Underfunded: -1
Grossly Underfunded: -3
Huge Security Service: -1
Enormous Security Service: -2
Well-Equipped or Better: +2

Competence

```
2D + Modifiers

```
Competence

5-6 Low DM+/-1
7-8 Normal DM+0
9-10 High DM+/-1
11-12 Very High DM+/-2
13+ Near-Flawless DM+/-3
```

The DM listed under Effect is applied to checks made by members of
the organization to detect crimes, spot concealed weapons, collect
forensic evidence, figure out the crooked accounting system or any other
procedural task. It may also be applied against someone trying to fast
talk, browbeat or otherwise derail or defeat an investigation. The DM
would be applied against Travellers trying to mount a legal defence, in
addition to the skill of the prosecuting lawyers. It represents the ability of
the security service to build and present a case, which is then used by
lawyers to obtain a conviction.

96

```
If a possible Fiasco is noted, the security service may cause its own
case to collapse or a supposedly coordinated operation might become
so disjointed that the targets are able to escape without much effort.
Even if the Travellers bungle their caper or escape, a Fiasco indicates
they get away with it due to the incompetence of local law enforcement.
```

```
CORRUPTION
The level of Corruption in a security service indicates its willingness to
ignore rules for various reasons. This can mean the system is riddled with
bribery or that cops actively extort money out of those they encounter.
It can also refer to ‘noble cause’ corruption, where a security service
might bypass due process or fabricate evidence in order to secure a
conviction or pursue an agenda. An organization wracked with nepotism
and paralysed by career-boosting infighting would also have a high
Corruption rating. The Referee must decide what sort of corruption the
security service suffers from – which can be multiple types.
```

```
Corruption is determined by a straight 2D roll.
```

```
Corruption
2D Result
2 Wracked with Corruption: Personnel actively seek advantage or
profit from all aspects of their duties.
3-4 Severe Corruption: Virtually impossible to get anything done
without bribery, influence or pursuing someone’s agenda.
5-6 Some Corruption: DM+2 on checks that match the corruption type
(such as an attempt to bribe an official or prosecute someone the
state considers undesirable).
7 Normal Corruption: Few organizations are completely clean.
8-9 Low Corruption: DM-2 on checks to bribe officials or attempts to
persuade them to take unscrupulous action.
10-11 Very Low Corruption: DM-4 on checks that go against the
organization’s high moral standards.
12 Virtually no Corruption: Accepting a bribe or using influence is
virtually unthinkable.
```

```
Note that it is possible for an organization to be extremely corrupt in
some ways but not in others. For example, a local security service might
consider it unthinkable to take a bribe to bend the rules but will perform
origami on them for someone with the right social connections.
```

```
97
```

INCIDENT RESPONSE

The Incident Response rating indicates how robustly – another word
might be ‘aggressively’ – the service responds to an incident. A high
response suggests that personnel deploy weapons a lot and call for
backup at the merest hint of trouble. A lower response indicates the
opposite – polite, patient attempts to resolve a matter with force used as
a last resort. Incident Response is determined by a straight 2D roll.

Response

```
2D Result
2 Extreme aversion to the use of force. Personnel will wait too long
before deploying, or using, weapons and are very reluctant to call
for backup.
3-4 Very reluctant to use force. Personnel will make every effort at a
peaceful resolution and may risk their own safety to avoid using
weapons.
5-6 Reluctant to threaten or use force but entirely willing at need.
7 Normal levels of prudence, balancing negotiation against the threat
of force.
8-9 Emphasis on officer safety; robust policies on the deployment of
weapons in any threatening situation.
10-11 Aggressive, threatening approach to most situations, backed up by
weapons and response teams if needed.
12 Positively trigger-happy.
```

The Incident Response is a general indicator of attitudes and procedures
among security personnel. Few will take this to extremes, shooting
people for littering or refusing to draw a weapon whilst under fire, but it
gives an indication of what degree of threat an officer needs to perceive
before he starts shooting.

EXAMPLE: FLATSBURG

_Flatsburg is an independent city-state on a balkanised world. It has a
population of around 120,000 divided between the city and its surrounding
agricultural belt. A small spaceport links the city to the wider universe
and sees a few minor trading vessels come through each week. It has
Population code 5, and Law Level 3._

_First, the Referee determines the size and nature of the security force.
There is no modifier for Population and DM-1 for Law Level. A 2D
roll comes up 11, modified to 10. Flatsburg has a large professional
security force with a size modifier of 1.5. The base personnel level for
a planetside security force is one in 500 people, giving 240 personnel._

98

```
Since the Flatsburg force is large, this is multiplied by 1.5 to 360 security
officers. It seems likely that these personnel include rangers who police
the countryside, port customs and security personnel, and police for the
city. They also double as a paramilitary defence force for lack of any
more potent organization.
```

```
The DM for funding is based on population; in this case, it is DM+0. A
2D roll of 6 gives a result of Underfunded. This indicates that 95% of
the force are equipped to routine level – this is 342 officers – with 18
better equipped response personnel. There are no elites in this large but
underfunded organization.
```

```
Underfunded status gives DM-2 for equipment and the Referee rolls
9 on 2D for a final result of 7. Routine officers have a standard level
of equipment – sidearms, light body armor and inexpensive vehicles,
whilst the response formation has slightly better equipment and access
to submachineguns or rifles.
```

```
Underfunded status also gives DM-1 for Competence. The Referee rolls
7 on 2D, modified to 6. Competence is a little low, probably due to a
lack of funds for training or poor personnel retention. Travellers trying to
slip contraband past these officers would gain DM+1 to their checks and
an attempt to investigate a crime and present a case in court would be
subject to DM-1.
```

```
Rolling 2D for Corruption the Referee gets a 3 – Severe Corruption. He
decides the security force is basically honest and not particularly receptive
to bribes but its officials are in the pocket of the city administration. Any
action that goes against their agenda will be opposed and the security
service is not above fitting someone up to please its masters.
```

```
A roll of 6 for Incident Response indicates the security service is somewhat
reluctant to use force. As officers are perhaps a little less confident in the
authority their cheap and ill-fitting uniforms project and there is a culture
of ‘deal with it yourself’, which the Referee decides is also dictated by
low funding. Those who constantly request scarce resources or pull
response units away from guarding the businesses of the social elite can
earn the disfavor of superiors, which in turn is career suicide.

##### EXTREMOPHILES

The majority of creatures live under conditions familiar to Travellers,
within normal limits of air pressure, gravity and temperature. Beyond
these conditions, life tends to take simple forms that are harmless to
the average Traveller under most circumstances. There are, however,
exceptions. The animals presented here are outside normal realms of
experience and should be used by the Referee as mysterious anomalies
rather than direct hostile encounters. They might also be the subject of
a scientific mission or attempt to harvest, remove, exploit or otherwise
interact in a manner somewhat different from the usual animal encounter.

PEAK TANGLER

Peak tanglers originated on some distant thin-atmosphere world and
spread over the centuries to many systems. They are extremely light,
tenuous webs of fibre, each with many super-fine hairs extending in the
manner of feathers. When fully unfurled the web can be three meters
or more across, or curled up to create a ball the size of a small pebble.
When curled, a peak tangler is still very light but dense enough to fall to
the ground. The unfurled web can catch the slightest updraft and lift the
creature high into the air.

Peak tanglers are so named because they are most commonly
encountered amid mountain-tops or the highest levels of tall buildings on
worlds with a normal atmosphere, floating free on the winds and feeding
off microscopic organic particles. In more dense atmospheres they tend
to drift in the upper air, far above cities. It is possible this is how the
species initially spread; spacecraft passing through the atmosphere may
have peak tanglers up on their hull.

A single tangler can be a nuisance to a Traveller, covering a window
or faceplate in semi-opaque fibres and getting in the way of fine work.
The tendrils rip easily enough but there are many of them; getting rid
of a tangler can be tricky. In theory, a Traveller who somehow got a
peak tangler on their face might breathe part of it in, which would be
detrimental to both Traveller and tangler.

Peak tanglers reproduce asexually, separating some of their fibres into a
new creature when they become too large and heavy to drift easily. On
their native worlds, peak tanglers receive little nutrition borne up by the
breeze; sufficient to allow them to feed and grow, but populations are
small. If a tangler colony becomes established on a world where there is
a lot of life at ground level, there will be much more organic matter in the
atmosphere. A population explosion may occur.

100

```
In many cases, such an event would go unnoticed but sometimes a
peak tangler infestation occurs. This takes the form of tanglers growing
too large to float but not dividing. The over-heavy tangler falls to the
ground where it continues to sustain itself by absorbing nutrients from
whatever vegetation it lands on or from the soil itself. This permits
further growth whilst slowly killing the plants beneath. Eventually, the
tangler will die but by that time it will have pulled all the organic matter
out of the ground beneath it, leaving dead soil in which nothing else
will grow. The process can take years or even decades, during which
a single grounded tangler can become a mat of fibres several meters
deep and hundreds across. The very largest infestations have been
known to reach tens of kilometers in width.
```

```
Tangler infestation is generally characterised by more or less round
areas of light-coloured web-like material on the ground or draped over
trees. The webs are thick enough to impede humans or even vehicles,
and tanglers can normally only be killed by fire or targeted toxins (energy
and slug weaponry will have no appreciable effect). Whilst generally
harmless to humans, an infestation is an eerie and disturbing sight
that may not be recognized for what it really is. Travellers might find
themselves wondering what manner of spider could spin such a web...

ARX

Exactly what ARX stands for – or if it is a word or a corruption of one – is
a matter for some debate. The name comes from an inscription carved
on the bulkhead of a derelict First Imperium scout vessel, lost for many
centuries in a backwater system. The state of the ship and presence of
an ARX nearby resulted in the term being used as an identifier.

ARX are space-going creatures that resemble asteroids from a distance.
Most are roughly shaped like a rugby ball, with protrusions and contours
that resemble natural features of an asteroid. Most are less than 30 meters
long on their main axis and 15-20 meters wide but larger individuals are
rumored to exist. Their life cycle is something of a mystery but it seems
that ARX absorb energy from stellar radiation and particles of matter
drifting in space. How they reproduce is entirely unknown; indeed hard
facts about any aspect of these animals are rare.

ARX have been encountered in colonies of a dozen or more individuals,
which appear to be at most loosely associated with one another. They
inhabit ring systems, Trojan asteroid clusters and major belts, although
reported sightings are often unreliable as the typical ARX closely
resembles a rock. It appears they can move by generating a weak
gravitic field – the means is unknown – which allows an ARX to change
its position or voyage to another star system over millennia.

There are wild tales associated with these creatures, which may or may
not have basis in reality. The least far-fetched suggests that ARX are
inquisitive or perhaps just attracted to gravitic drive systems. Ships have
reported being followed through an asteroid belt by ‘mobile rocks’, which
suggests ARX can move quickly when they want to.

According to wilder tales, the ability to generate gravitic propulsion is due
to exotic materials found at the core of an ARX and can be extracted by
cutting or blasting it apart. People who tell this tale also speak of particularly
large, and sometimes aggressive ARX, and claim that some can create a
‘gravitic shock’ that can damage passing ships. Scientists have recorded
gravitic disturbances similar to a large ship emerging from jump space,
where no ship was detected. The cause of these gravitic ‘ripples’ remains
unclear and it is possible that the legendary ARX caused them.

ARX cannot be assessed like other creatures. They are made of silica-
based material and are far beyond the boundaries of normal human
experience. If they exist at all – which scientists continue to dispute –
they do not seem dangerous under most circumstances. However, a ship
might find itself being nudged by an inquisitive ARX attracted to its drive
output and unwary prospectors might find themselves in danger if their
promising claim turns out to have a silica-based nervous system.

SARGASSO HIVE

The sargasso hive – or hives; it is not clear if there are others on distant
worlds – is a gigantic floating cluster of what appears to be seaweed.
However, it contains material similar to primitive neurons and when
connected in sufficient quantity can begin functioning as a brain of sorts,
feeding off decomposing plant material and animal life. Although crude,
the neural network thus created is very large and has achieved intellect
similar to lower-order animals.

More significantly, the sargasso hive is capable of using psionic
talents, an ability developed to assist in obtaining high-value food.
Fish, plankton and sea birds are attracted into the entangling nets of
seaweed where they die and are absorbed by the psionic proto-brain
of the hive. It has been postulated that if the hive were to grow large
enough it might become sentient, although there is no way to prove
this one way or another without undertaking a massive program
of feeding to allow the hive to grow sufficiently large. An attempt was
made at this some years ago by an organization dedicated to creating
a psionic god for itself. Many members of this possible cult met a
mysterious end and the attempt collapsed.

One thing learned from this project is that the sargasso hive requires
a very large amount of food to sustain its plant-based brain. If this is
not available in the form of animal life attracted into the seaweed mat,
seaweed itself becomes the main source of nutrition. This causes the
hive to shrink and in turn weakens its psionic potential. The strength of
the hive’s psionic talents, and the amount of food it requires to sustain
its ‘mind’, correlate to the area of the seaweed mat, which means that
doubling in radius requires four times as much food to sustain.

The mat is currently around 4 kilometers in radius. It has shrunk to a little
less than one kilometer at times and never been observed at more than
9 kilometers. An increase in size means an increase in psionic ability and
therefore more food attracted over a greater area but this exhausts local
resources, causing a new contraction. The mat has also been observed
to change locations in a manner that does not correspond to wind or
currents, suggesting it has some means of locomotion. If it were to get
into rich waters it might devastate the local fishing industry and pose a
threat to settlements in the area. Growth would also be rapid, at least in
the short term, which could have unpredictable effects.

The sargasso hive cannot be considered a standard animal; it is more
like a mobile geographical feature with psionic abilities. Its behaviour
might be considered to fit the behavioural categories of siren and filter.
Small creatures are entangled in its seaweed tendrils until they die but
the hive has additional ways of dealing with birds and perhaps even
unwary Travellers. These are all psionics-based but in some cases
replicate traits possessed by non-psionic creatures.

104

```
Psionic Strength: The PSI characteristic of the hive depends upon its
size. For every kilometer in radius the hive gains, D3 is added to its PSI.
Thus at its present radius of 4km it has PSI 4D3, averaging around 8.
The hive’s psionic strength replenishes at the rate of D3 points per hour.
```

```
Psionic Reservoir: The hive’s unique structure acts as a psionic reservoir,
storing 1D points per kilometer of radius. This means that at its present
4km radius it typically has 4D points of stored psionic power, averaging
around 14. This reservoir can be used before its PSI characteristic and is
replenished by transferring from its PSI.
```

```
Psionic Lure: The psionic lure ability works passively, at all times. It
automatically attracts small creatures such as plankton and fish, although
it produces a general trend to move towards the hive rather than an
overwhelming compulsion. Sentient creatures are more strongly, but
selectively, targeted. It is not clear why this is but it may be an instinctive
reaching-out of the proto-mind to others. Unfortunately, it also brings
people onto the mat where they tend to meet an untimely end. The
Psionic Lure takes the form of Suggestion (see page 198 of the Traveller
Core Rulebook) to come to the hive. No other Suggestion has ever been
observed, meaning this may be an unconscious and invariable talent, but it
does have a greater range. Base range is Very Long and can be extended
as normal. The constant luring of lesser minds costs the hive no power but
luring a sentient being costs 3 PSI, with increases for range as normal.
```

```
Psionic Attack: The hive will not necessarily attack people wandering
on its upper surface or hovering close by on grav vehicles. It is likely
to attack anyone moving away who resisted a lure attempt or anyone
causing harm. The psionic attack is not like a standard psionic assault.
Indeed, it bears a resemblance to the Bioelectricity trait possessed by
some creatures. The attack creates an electric field around the target
by psionic means, shocking them for 1D damage. This costs the hive
D3 PSI, +1 point per extra target. It is not clear how many people or
other targets can be shocked at once but it is known that at least four
people can be attacked simultaneously. The attack has a base range of
Short and can be made once every 1D rounds. This is typically used to
incapacitate birds and other creatures as food but can be used in self-
defence.
```

```
Psionic Skills: The hive is treated as having a psionic skill levels of 1 +1
per full 3 kilometers of radius. At present this indicates a skill of 2 for its
talents, a reasonable level but one not directed by rational thought. It is
not known if there is an upper limit to the hive’s capabilities.
```

```
Growth Potential: The hive currently has a similar level of intellect to
a mouse or similar small creature. It may become smarter if it grows
and its psionic potential will certainly increase. It is also possible that
additional psionic abilities may appear. At least one group believes that
with sufficient nutrition the hive will grow to a size where it will become
capable of sentient thought and telepathy, but this has not been tested.

##### IISS FIELD EQUIPMENT

The Imperial Interstellar Scout Service uses a wide range of equipment,
with less overall uniformity than the armed services. Some items are
standard-issue to almost all personnel, others tailored to one specific
requirement. The items presented here can be encountered in the hands,
or about the person, of scouts almost anywhere.

#### >> SECTION 1: OUTFITS & GENERIC GEAR <<

Working Dress

```
The working dress of the Imperial Interstellar Scout
Service – the famous ‘rumpled grey coveralls’ – is
designed to provide protection from day-to-day
hazards. It is gas-resistant, enabling the wearer
to survive – with great discomfort – a trace
atmosphere if breathing gear is available or avoid
contamination with toxic gases and vapours.
Tags on the ankles seal to standard-issue boots
and if worn with an emergency survival kit
can provide protection against hard vacuum
for a few minutes. The Scout Service sells
on a lot of old equipment, including working
dress, and takes pride that everything still
works. Logos are removed from coveralls
offered on the surplus market however.
```

```
Working dress coveralls are generally
worn with a sleeveless ‘ship-jacket’ that
has multiple pockets and attachment points for
equipment. An emergency kit is also available
containing gloves and a collapsible bubble
helmet as well as a one hour air bottle, a small
hand-held lamp and a multitool suitable mainly
for quickly getting into the emergency equipment
lockers. The E-kit costs an additional Cr25;
Scout Service vehicles usually contain several.

Field Dress *

```
Working dress is worn for most routine tasks but for
any situation requiring protection from environmental
hazards – which includes hostile action – field dress
is worn instead. This consists of a TL15 tailored vacc
suit with detachable gloves and a bubble helmet
carried in a pocket. The suit is impervious to gas if
properly sealed. The suit has slimline, lightweight
batteries built in and packs of oxygenated gel that
allow 30 minutes’ survival (with a helmet) even
without a life support pack or air bottles. The suit’s
batteries last for two to three days of operation
under light-load conditions and at least an hour
under heavy load. The batteries power the
suit’s heating/cooling circuit and glow patches
on the gloves and torso, allowing a scout to act
as his own light source or emergency beacon.
```

```
The bubble helmet is normally used only in
emergencies. For situations where vacuum
conditions are expected, the scout will
normally wear a torso piece over the suit,
permitting a hard helmet to be worn. Known
as a PLSS (Personal Life Support System),
this torso piece/pack contains emergency
tools and a pair of disposable thruster units
known to scouts as ‘spray cans’. These permit
a distressed scout to get back to safety if
they lose contact with a hull in microgravity.
Endurance is six hours on full life support.
```

```
For security operations in non-vacuum
conditions, a tactical torso piece and helmet
are used instead. The torso piece has the
usual magazine pouches, medical kit, snub pistol holster and
a tactical knife/saw useful for rescue work as well as combat.

Translation Analysis Unit

A variety of language translators are used by Travellers throughout
Charted Space. Many are software systems downloaded to a Traveller’s
personal comm, using its sound pickups and outputs to provide two-
way translation. Scouts will usually have a few useful languages on
their comms but those engaged in contact or liaison work need a more
generally-capable device. The IISS Translation Analysis Unit, or TAU,
contains a database of hundreds of languages and other communication
forms but does more than merely translate. It analyses sounds and
other inputs, cross-referencing with known languages and looking for
both matches and patterns.

A TAU can, given enough time and variety of input, determine if what
is being heard is a language at all, then begin to decode it. This is a
very lengthy process unless there are common points of reference such
as known words from a related language. ‘TAU-bashing’ is a popular
pastime among bored scouts. It consists of exposing the TAU unit to
non-language sounds and asking for a translation. Some of the things
a vibrating thruster unit or a coolant pipe ‘say’ are hilarious. Others are
downright disturbing.

Recreational uses aside, a TAU can attempt to decipher hieroglyphics
and similar symbols or at least determine that a set of marks are artificial.
It can interpret light pulses as well as sound and with olfactory input
can eventually figure out even pheromone-based languages. The time
required depends on the sample available and similarity to known forms
of communication. Often non-sound communication cannot be turned
into intelligible language at all but an indication of
emotional state may be possible.

Its rugged case is fitted with carrying
handles and pack straps, with a variety of
deployable sensors carried as standard.
The TAU can also take inputs from comms,
remote cameras and the like, and can
communicate with a ship’s computer for
additional processing power.

Field Glasses

```
The term ‘field glasses’ is archaic and refers to simple optical binoculars,
which does the IISS Portable Radiation Imaging System (PRIS) a great
injustice. It resembles a rugged set of binoculars but is in fact an electronic
sensor and display unit capable of ‘seeing’ all forms of electromagnetic
radiation and providing a visible output. It also includes a laser rangefinder
and short-range magnetic resonance pulse generator.
```

```
Basic functions include optical zoom up to 225x magnification, with
gyroscopic magnification and also a ‘false stabilization’ system that
creates a stable image of a locked target even if the user’s hands are
shaking and the device is essentially scanning over a large area. The
area-scan function can be used to create an image over a wide arc,
which is stored to be studied later. This means the user can sweep his
PRIS unit across the area to be scanned a few times then duck out of
sight behind an obstruction and study the captured scene in detail.
```

```
The display can be highly confusing to a new user and many never
discover the true potential of this device. In the right hands it can be used
to build a picture of an area across the entire electromagnetic spectrum.
Objects that might be invisible to normal cameras or thermal devices
might become obvious when their radio-frequency or electromagnetic
emissions are scanned for. The resonance scanner allows a limited
ability to look ‘inside’ an object, detecting internal structure or contents
by means of magnetic resonance that also gives an indication of
composition.
```

```
The standard PRIS set is manufactured at TL12 and resembles a pair
of armored binoculars. At TL15 most functions can be fitted into a
device resembling a set of sunglasses with a thick upper frame. This
version still requires a control input, by means of a wrist-mounted unit.
A mistake with the controls can result in the user seeing only X-rays or
receiving a confusing all-spectrum riot of information, but used correctly
the device has many applications from engineering to reconnaissance.
The TL15 ‘sunglasses’ version does not incorporate a rangefinder or
resonance scanner.

**>> SECTION 2: FIELD SCANNERS & DETECTORS <<**

```
IISS teams use a variety of hand-held scanning devices, all of which
are built on a standard frame. This is rugged enough to survive years of
abuse in the field but lightweight and easy to carry. All scanners proved
DM+2 on relevant checks.
```

Weapon Scanner

```
A handheld device using simple magnetism, magnetic resonance
scanning and an ultrasound emitter, the weapon scanner can detect
most known personal weaponry at a distance of a dozen meters or
so. Its primary use is to ensure guests do not smuggle weapons into
a secured area and that ‘unarmed’ diplomats really are so. It can also
detect large amounts of explosives and propellants at a distance of 50
meters or more, giving an indication of where artillery ammunition may
be stored or whether a bomb has been planted.
```

Biochemical Sampler/Scanner

```
A handheld biochem scanner can detect most harmful gases, spore clouds
and the like at a distance of tens of meters and can conduct analysis of
compounds by way of a sampler and probes. The unit is designed to be
useful to untrained personnel and can automatically conduct basic tasks.
It will also give warnings of hazardous conditions such as low or high air
pressure, toxic gases or low oxygen content in the air. The air pressure
and humidity sensors can also give a rough indication of how soon rain
or snowfall will begin. This can prevent inconvenience in some cases
and save lives in others. A more skilled operator can make better use of
the sampler, correlating the presence of certain compounds with known
processes to produce a rough field analysis of anything from mineral
wealth concentrations or volcanism, to the possibility of life existing
somewhere on an apparently barren planet.
```

```
Weapon scanner
```

Biochemical sampler/scanner

110

Medical Scanner

```
The medical scanner can be used at a short distance but is intended to
be pressed against the skin of the paitent’s torso for a full set of readings.
In this case it will determine temperature, heart rate and pulse condition,
skin moisture and chemical composition of skin secretions and a range of
other information. The device is keyed to a particular species but can be
reprogrammed for another or used to obtain physiological information on
an unknown creature. A small detachable needle probe can also be used
to take a blood sample, in which case the unit will detect most common
toxins and warn of anything else affecting the subject’s bloodstream. For
example, the presence of certain hormones might indicate a reaction to
something in the local environment. The unit’s database is extensive but
limited; in the hands of a Traveller with medical training it provides useful
information but cannot replace a medic’s own judgement. An untrained
person can still benefit from using the device – for example, it will detect
dropping blood pressure due to a wound and advise the user on what
to do. The medical scanner can also act as an emergency defibrillator,
although this drains the batteries quickly.

##### RAMON SANYARVO

A qualified second officer and master pilot, Ramon is a shabby, poorly
dressed individual who, when met, will probably be unemployed. He
can present excellent credentials showing years of experience handling
a variety of ship types but, considering the demand for good pilots,
his appearance and lack of current work will seem suspicious. A little
research into his background at any starport computer information center
(consulting lists of accredited pilots, for example) will turn up the fact that
Ramon has been blacklisted by a large corporation, Acreidiat Lines. The
notation ‘un trustworthy’ appears beside his name.

Ramon was once a master pilot with Acreidiat, a passenger and freight
line operating in the Solomani Rim. He was accused of having an affair
with the line president’s wife, a charge which he will steadfastly deny if
questioned. The blacklisting has blocked all hope of employment by the
major mer cantile concerns in this region of space.

In the years that followed, Ramon has made his living flying for small
freight companies, tramp traders and local shuttle services. Embittered,
he turned to drink and has been steadily deteriorating in performance,
attitude and appearance. Those small jobs have been increasingly
hard to hold on to and Ramon has become a drifter, making one or two
voyages before being fired and left behind on another planet until he can
find another short-lived job to keep him going.

Thin, dark and saturnine, Ramon’s appearance is seedy, and his
face usually silent and withdrawn, but occasionally – especially when
drunk – he flies into uncontrolled fits of violent rage. He is antisocial, a
solitary drunk, often to be seen in the corner of a bar drinking himself
into a stupor.

Ramon may turn up as a potential hireling in response to an advert
for a pilot placed by the Travellers. If so, he will (temporarily) curb his
drinking in an attempt to reform and secure the position, presenting the
best appearance he can manage. Should the Travellers hire him, either
without making a check of his background or regardless of it, he will
prove to be a first class pilot, with fine instincts for ship handling and wide
technical knowledge. Within 1D weeks, however, his drinking will present
a problem. At an inconvenient time of the Referee’s choosing, he will be
found locked in the bridge, drunk. This, or similar complications, can lead
to interesting side adventures.

Travellers may also encounter Ramon as a fellow passenger aboard an
Acreidiet line starship. In this case, it is likely that he intends some act of
revenge – a hijacking, sabotage attempt or similar. He might approach the

Travellers openly, offering to hire them to assist him in such an attempt

asking them to deliver a package on board, a package that holds a bomb.
On the other hand, it may be company officials that approach the Travellers,
hiring them to keep an eye on Ramon while he travels.
```

```
Finally, adventures may be forced on the Travellers against their wishes
when they are caught in the middle after Ramon makes his move.
```

```
As an added complication, the Referee may choose to introduce the
president of the line, Alfred Dunbar and/or his wife, to expand upon
possible romantic/revenge aspects of the situation.
```

```
Dunbar is cold, business-like and unfriendly, with a tendency towards
jealousy that is easily triggered by attention to his wife. Leila, much
younger than her husband, is restless, and tired of being neglected in
favor of business. Either one could be a valuable friends (or a dangerous
opponent) due to their influence in local business circles.
```

```
Possible interactions between Ramon, the Travellers and the Dunbars
should be explored by Referees interested in providing an unusual
adventure.

##### THE BLACK MARKET

There are those who think that laws are merely an inconvenience and
those who consider that bans, restrictions and prohibitions are nothing
more than an excuse to put prices up. Wherever these two are found in
the same place, a thriving black market is likely.

There are many reasons why an item might be banned, restricted or
otherwise not available through normal channels. Some items are
dangerous, some offend local morality and some are simply hard to
come by. The difficulty of sourcing such an item, and the price that has to
be paid to get it, depends on a number of factors.

LAW LEVEL

Generally, although not universally, the higher a world’s Law Level the
more items that be illegal. Penalties are also, in general, more severe
on high-law worlds. The Traveller Core Rulebook (pages 223-4) gives
an indication of what weaponry and armor is legally available at any
given Tech Level. From this it is possible to extrapolate local attitudes
to many other items, although the Referee should tailor this to the
local society. It may be that a culture feels owning multiple automatic
weapons is simply an indicator of adulthood but despises drug use so
much that simple painkillers are restricted.

As a general rule, laws are enacted either to protect people or the state –
sometimes both. For example, restrictions on the possession of military
grade weapons make it much harder for citizens to stage an armed
insurrection and may also limit the damage caused by neighborhood
disputes. A ban on fast ground cars benefits the state relatively little but
may save lives.

Thus when deciding if an item is restricted or banned, the Referee should
consider how much harm could be done to others by irresponsible use
and whether widespread ownership poses a potential threat to the
stability of society.

Social or Moral Unacceptability
Some things are repugnant to society as a whole. Occasionally this
attitude is genuinely incomprehensible to outsiders, as social or moral
restrictions often have nothing to do with the amount of harm an item
could do. For example, a world might ban clothing of a particular colour
for religious reasons. These factors depend largely on local attitudes
but also upon the prevailing interstellar culture. A world that permits

114

```
slavery when all of its neighbors do not will usually have an interesting
story associated with it; such a situation causes friction and must exist
for a reason. Overall, social and moral factors must be imposed by
the Referee, using the information on page 221 of the Traveller Core
Rulebook as a guide.
```

```
Control or Financial
Some items are restricted by the local government for the purpose
of making money out of licenses, training courses or the item itself.
Alternatively, an item might be restricted in order to keep the population
in line. For example, if the people of a world need a particular medication
to deal with atmospheric taint, then controlling it allows the price to
be pushed up or access to be denied to those who do not conform.
Control and financial restrictions vary from minor influence over the
lawmaking process exerted by business and industrial groups, to cynical
profiteering. There have been cases where even air and water were
subject to government controls. This might be for good reasons, such as
to prevent waste in an environment where replenishment is difficult, but it
is possible that a particularly nasty government might expect its citizens
to pay through the nose for the privilege of breathing.
```

```
Controls, Restrictions and Bans
The Law Level of a world indicates what items are outright illegal but this
does not necessarily mean they are prohibited to everyone. Some items
require special permits, which usually come with social requirements.
For example, a Law Level 8 world prohibits almost all weapons but
may allow members of a local defence volunteer formation to retain
weapons in their own homes. The privilege of having an automatic
weapon in a disarmed society is balanced by the obligation to use it in
defence of that society. Likewise, a given world may almost completely
ban powered vehicles but allow them to be owned and used by the
emergency services. Partial restrictions make it easier to get items
than a complete ban, as they can be stolen, ‘misplaced’ or otherwise
redirected from lawful owners. Items that are totally prohibited are
much harder to come by.
```

```
Some items may normally be permitted according to local Law Level but
require special licensing to obtain or use. In such a situation forgery or
corruption of the licensing process might be more useful than stealing
the item itself. It may be possible to simply walk into a shop and buy
an item once the permit is in place or to get one from an official supply
depot. There are many ways to get around prohibitions and controls, in
addition to the obvious routes of smuggling, stealing or setting-up an
underground workshop and manufacturing prohibited items.
```

```
115
```

FINDING A SUPPLIER

It is exceedingly rare for a black-market shopping emporium to exist.
More commonly, there will be multiple small-scale markets such as a
shop owner who sells illegal drugs or guns ‘under the counter’ or an
individual who can get items via a process he will not describe. Most
illicit dealers have a limited range of goods, typically specialising in
one area where they have contacts. Thus the Travellers may find their
go-to for stolen military ammunition cannot help them get vehicles or
pharmaceuticals. They may, however, know someone who can.

A more general contact will not, normally, maintain stock for sale.
Instead, they arrange deals. The Travellers will have to set-up a deal
with such an individual but will not get goods directly from them. They
may mysteriously find items on the back seat of their air/raft, or go to a
shady backstreet meeting with nervous and well-armed criminals. These
delivery agents are usually low-level criminals with no real knowledge of
the larger operation and no clear links back to the dealer.

The first stage in buying or selling on the black market is to find a supplier
(or buyer). This can be very easy in some areas where there is little
effective law enforcement, and difficult in others. The Travellers will need
to make discreet enquiries and a successful Average (8+) Streetwise
check. The ‘discreet’ part is important here; black marketeers are unlikely
to reveal themselves to a bunch of noisy offworld tourists flashing wads
of cash and asking about illegal goods. Such activity will attract too much
attention, so the majority of potential contacts will stay away. Those that
are attracted will generally be of low importance and high stupidity.

To determine the type of contact the Travellers make, roll 2D and add the
Effect of the Streetwise check on the Black Market Contacts table, with
the following modifiers.

Very clumsy, blatant approach: DM-4
Unplanned, careless approach: DM-2
Discreet, well planned approach: DM+2
Law Level: DM- Law Level

Travellers may note it is easier to find dealers in illicit goods where
few things are illegal. This is not a contradiction in terms; black market
dealers can obtain hard-to-get items that are not actually illegal, just rare
or found only in the hands of organizations like navies or corporations
who only sell to high-end and governmental clients. Such items may not
be illegal locally but are still impossible to get through normal channels.

For example, the Travellers are on a Law Level 9 world and desperately
want weaponry. They seek a black marketeer and make careful enquires
in a manner the Referee thinks appropriate and not likely to attract undue
attention. This is worth DM+2 and the Effect of their Streetwise check is
+3, for a total of +5. However, Law Level 9 takes the DM down to -4. The
Travellers roll 8 on 2D, modified to 4 and find themselves a mid-level
black marketeer.
```

```
The Referee decides this underground gun merchant has modest
supplies of light automatic weapons and a couple of lasers, plus a larger
amount of cheap handguns – some of which look to have been thrown
together in a blacksmith’s shop. The Travellers are disappointed there
are no fusion guns on sale, of course, but this is better than nothing. They
ask about illegal information and drugs but their contact has none for
sale. He does, however, know a guy and provides some information for a
fee. The Referee decides this gives the Travellers DM+2 on attempts to
find more black marketeers in the same area.
```

```
117
```

BUYING AND SELLING

Goods traded on the black market fall into categories that have more to
do with the amount of trouble the possessor would get into for having
them than their actual value. The degree of difficulty inherent in obtaining
the item also pushes up the price.

Uncommon items may be simply difficult to obtain or require paperwork
that most people cannot get. By definition, any item offered on the black
market is considered at least Uncommon. For example, items that are
locally legal but hard to get or restricted to a segment of the population
are defined as Uncommon.

Rare items are very hard to obtain but may not be illegal. Items heavily
restricted or controlled, such as spares for grav vehicles that only the
world’s nobility are allowed to have, would be Rare – so would alien
artefacts from a minor race whose items are not commonly traded but
not subject to restrictions.

Ultra-Rare items are extremely hard to get either due to legal
complications or their rarity. An example would be Ancients artefacts that
are both very rare and also require special licensing.

118

```
Restricted items are subject to licensing or other means of keeping
them out of the hands of the average citizen.
```

```
Illegal items are specifically banned to those who do not have a special
license, which is hard to get or restricted to a small segment of the
population. An example wold be military grade weapons restricted to the
armed forces or special police units, or Ancients artefacts.
```

```
Highly Illegal items carry significant legal penalties for possession,
such as a decade in prison. Examples include large military systems like
tanks, large explosive devices or the most illegal of drugs.
```

```
Extremely Illegal items generally carry penalties like life imprisonment
or death. Examples include weapons of mass destruction.
```

```
BASE PRICE
The black market is heavily biased in favor of those with the right
connections. This will rarely be the Travellers, so they will have to
pay the asking price (which will be inflated) or accept a low price for
what they are selling. If they can get a better deal elsewhere, they are
welcome to try that.
```

```
The base price an item can be bought or sold for is determined by its
legality and rarity. Note that an item can be Uncommon/Rare/Ultra-
Rare and Restricted/Illegal/Highly Illegal/Extremely Illegal. Both sets of
modifiers then apply.
```

_For example, the Travellers want to buy starship components they
cannot find in port. These are not illegal or restricted but are uncommon,
so have to be sourced by creative means. The Travellers’ contact offers
to sell them at a base price of 125% normal cost. The Travellers also
have an ultra-rare alien fusion bomb for sale. Its rarity pushes the price
up to 200% of normal market value but the fact that the dealer could be
shot out of hand for handling it takes this down to 5% of that figure. The
Travellers are offered about half the weapon’s nominal value._

Price Variance
The values above are base prices, which may be adjusted by good
bargaining or market factors. To determine the final buying and selling
price for items, Travellers should make an Average (8+) Broker or
Persuade check, adding the Effect to a 2D roll on the Price Variance
table.

Price Variance

```
2D + Effect Final Selling Price Final Buying Price
0- 20% 200%
1-2 40% 175%
3-4 60% 150%
5-6 80% 125%
7-8 100% 100%
9-10 110% 90%
11-12 120% 80%
13+ 125% 70%
```

_For example, the Travellers are trying to sell a collection of military
vehicles they have... acquired. Base price for the lot is determined as
MCr5. To find a final price the Travellers make a Broker check, getting
an Effect of +2, and add this to a 2D roll that unfortunately comes up a 4.
This is a total of 6, so the Travellers end up getting 80% of the base price
or MCr4. Turns out there is not much of a market for slightly used grav
tanks on that world. They are welcome to take their arsenal offworld of
course and seek another contact... if they can._

##### SPACE COMBAT PRIMER

```
Space combat in Traveller is lightweight and cinematic. The rules convey
the basics of movement, sensor detection, targeting and attack, without
cumbersome detail. Space battles in movies and television shows often
take their cue from aerial battles between fighter planes, including
dogfighting techniques ill-suited to the realities of space. Space combat
in Traveller is more akin to submarine warfare with opposing spacecraft
striving to find each other in an abyssal environment and wreaking
destruction upon one another once they do.
```

```
This article is designed to give a quick overview of space combat,
including some items found in the Traveller Core Rulebook, High
Guard and Pirates of Drinax. A narrative featuring the ill-fated flight of
the Beowulf is interspersed to convey how various rules might play out
dramatically in a gaming session.
```

```
Attention all crew: The Beowulf has completed wilderness
refuelling operations and we are heading out to the jump point.
Astrogation, please transmit our flight plan to the mainworld
highport via tight beam on the standard frequency.
```

```
Space combat begins with an encounter. The first thing that must be
established is the initial range. Traveller classifies ranges starting with
adjacent (about one kilometer, visible to the naked eye) to Distant (more
than 50,000 kilometers) at which only minimal details can be made out
even when using advanced sensors. Obtaining detailed information
about another ship at Long or greater range is a bit like finding a needle
in a haystack, a tiny spark of energy and movement seen across the vast
reaches of space. Sensors and computers provide enough information
to know approximately where other ships in the vicinity are but targeting
and engaging them in combat takes expertise.
```

```
At minimum, the Referee needs nothing more than the DMs for each
sensor type but for more details, refer to the table on page 19 of High
Guard. Civilian sensors have only lidar and radar. Each step up provides
superior sensory detection, topping out at advanced sensors that include
densitometers, jammers and neural activity sensors. If used at the
appropriate ranges, advanced sensors can provide a complete picture of
an opposing ship right down to how many crew members are aboard and
how full the cargo hold is. The Sensor Target and Sensor Detail tables on
page 150 of the Traveller Core Rulebook describe what each sensor type
can ‘see’ at various distances.
```

```
121
```

```
Captain, we have a bogey originating from the deeps of
the gas giant. Too far out of range to get much detail but its
heading is similar to ours. Minimal visual and thermal data but
I’d say the ship is of relatively small size, under 1,000 tons
and giving off a heat signature much more powerful than our
own. Probably military.
```

In some situations, only one of the two parties may locate the other for
all or part of the encounter. Superior sensors, emissions absorption

122

```
grids and stealth technology provide a significant edge. A ship with
superior sensors and stealth technology can easily achieve surprise on
a less well-equipped spacecraft.
```

```
In a typical encounter, both participants detect each other at the ranges
shown in the Range Bands table on page 151 of the Traveller Core
Rulebook. Ship’s sensors are assumed to be running automatically,
giving basic information about the ship’s surroundings; nearby spacecraft,
space stations, orbital starports, asteroids and large debris. For more
specific information, the sensor operator must make an Average (8+)
Electronics (sensors) check (INT). Checks are modified by several
factors including the following:
```

- Sensor type: Refer to the table on page 19 of _High Guard_ for the DM
    of each sensor type. The Travellers incur DM-4 for basic sensors all
    the way up to DM+2 for advanced.
- Hull features: Some ships have hulls with special equipment and
    coatings that provide a negative DM to sensor checks. Emissions
    absorption grids, stealth and superior stealth are described on pages
    12-13 of _High Guard_. Conversely, equipment such as extended
    arrays increase the signature of a ship, making it easier to detect.
- Transponders: Starships operating in the Imperium are expected to
    run transponders at all times, transmitting the ship’s identity for all
    to see and applying DM+4 to sensor checks as described on page
    146 of the Traveller Core Rulebook. Ship captains may shut down
    the transponder when threatened by a potentially hostile spacecraft
    or when travelling in dangerous territory, despite the fact that
    technically it may be illegal to do so. Furthermore, running without
    one’s transponder carries dangers all its own since the ship might be
    mistaken for a pirate by system defence forces.

```
A ship cannot fire upon an opposing ship it has not yet detected. However,
once the ship is found, detection is maintained for the duration of combat
unless the Referee determines otherwise. Extenuating circumstances
such as the ship passing through a magnetic field, a dense asteroid belt
or shutting down all of its systems to reduce its signature may optionally
require a subsequent sensor check to relocate a ship.
```

```
A typical battle is joined after opposing ships locate and target one
another but when only one combatant can find the other, space combat
becomes an extremely one-sided affair. Sensory detection is key. A
masked or stealth ship with superior sensors can enjoy multiple rounds
of surprise, attacking a target with impunity.
```

```
She’s cut the distance between us to 30,000 klicks, captain.
Matching our vector and approaching at about 4gs – possibly a
patrol corvette. Shall I hail her?
```

```
123
```

**LIGHTING THE TORCH**
Finding a ship before it can find you provides a huge tactical advantage.
The first ship to acquire another with its sensors effectively has surprise
if not detected by the other. However, once combat begins, surprise is
quickly lost and it becomes much easier for the opposing ship to find
the attacker.

The Referee may optionally determine that once one side attacks the
other, surprise is lost and the besieged ship automatically detects the
attacker. Use of weapons, active sensors and radio communications
creates an energy signature that makes it considerably easier to find
an attacking ship.

Ships with emissions absorption grids and stealth are difficult to
find even after they fire their weapons. Apply DM+2 for subsequent
Electronics (sensors) checks but retain negative DMs associated with
stealth technology.

Alternatively, refer to the excellent article, ‘Sensor Operations,’ in Journal
_of the Traveller’s Aid Society #4_ , which provides a whole slew of new and
highly usable sensor rules.

LET THE BATTLE BEGIN

Once both combatants have located each other with sensors and the
battle has begun, determine who has the Initiative. Determining Initiative
is a two-step process, the first of which is performed by having each side
make an Average (8+) Tactics (naval) check. Then roll 2D for each ship,
adding the pilot’s Pilot skill, the ship’s maximum Thrust and the Effect of
the Tactics (naval) check. The ship with the highest score has the Initiative.

After Initiative is determined it is time to move to the heart of the space
combat sequence, which consists of six-minute rounds divided into the
following steps:

```
•  Maneuver
•  Attack
•  Action
```

MANOEUVRING

The Maneuver Step is all about a ship’s Thrust score. If a ship has
little Thrust, this step is simple to assess. However, if there is a fast ship
involved in the battle, several choices must be made.

In order of Initiative score, determine how much Thrust is used for
acceleration. See the Movement rules on pages 155-156 of the Traveller
Core Rulebook for a detailed description. Selecting how much Thrust to

```
Distance x 1000
```

```
Thrust x 9.81 x 0.5
```

```
Seconds of
Travel Time
```

124

```
use is different than selecting direction. The combatants must negotiate
direction to prevent the lower Initiative score ship from gaining an unfair
advantage. For example, the combatant with the lower Initiative may
not suddenly turn tail and close the distance on the ship with the higher
Initiative score simply because it goes second in Initiative order. The
ship with the higher score gets the option to turn as well, maintaining
the desired distance limited by the amount of Thrust it has applied to
acceleration. More often than not, both ships are heading in the same
direction with one pursuing the other.
```

```
The pilot may aid gunners by positioning the ship for optimal firing
angles, dock with an opposing ship if the gap has been narrowed to
Adjacent, or perform Evasive Action against attacks if additional Thrust
remains. Note that only one of the above actions may be selected by
the pilot each round.
```

```
She’s not responding to our comms. Gunners to stations. She’s
cut distance to 25,000km and is targeting us. Comms, transmit
Signal GK.
```

```
THE GREAT ESCAPE
Making a break for jump point does not necessarily mean a ship has to
accelerate to the halfway point, turn around and decelerate to zero by the
time the 100-diameter limit is reached. A ship may opt to accelerate from
close orbit all the way to the jump point, entering jump space with a high
delta-V. Velocity is preserved during a jump so when the ship comes out
a week later, it is going the same speed it was going before it entered
jump. A ship performing this maneuver can get to a jump point much
faster than one attempting to achieve a full stop at 100 diameters.
```

```
There are two ways to determine how long it takes a ship to cover the
desired distance. The first method uses the following equation:
```

```
For the sake of simplicity, the Referee may simply determine the distance
to the jump point and then add the escaping ship’s thrust to a running
total each round. One point of thrust from a full stop covers approximately
2,000 kilometers, so after two rounds, a ship with continuous Thrust 1
covers 4,000 kilometers. After three rounds, it covers 6,000 kilometers
and so on. With a decent head start, even a free trader might make it to
the jump point and get out of a system before its pursuers can get close
enough to attack.
```

```
125
```

ATTACK

The ship’s gunners have analysed the sensor data, determined where
the opposing ship is – or will be – and it is time to fire! Weapons are
fired by gunners with the exception of fixed-mount weapons that may be
fired by the pilot. Turret weapons may fire in all arcs whilst fixed-mount
weapons must be facing the target.

For each weapon used to attack, make an Average (8+) Gunner (DEX)
check, adding range and other DMs described in the Traveller Core
Rulebook. Note that the Attack step has two phases, the Attack phase
and Reactions phase. Reactions include:

- Evasive Action, which enables a ship to dodge incoming attacks with
    unspent Thrust.
- Point Defence, in which a ship’s lasers shoot down enemy missiles
    instead of attacking.
- Disperse Sand, in which sandcasters are fired in order to reduce
    laser damage.

126

```
A good rule of thumb is to flip to the Reaction phase each time an attack
is made.
```

```
We are taking fire! Repeat! We are taking fire. Taking evasive
action. Turret one, go to point defence. Turret two, return fire!
```

```
Determine damage as you would in ground combat, adding the effect
of the Gunner check and subtracting armor from the total. Determine
Critical Hit Location and damage for all hits with an Effect of six or higher.
```

```
When assessing damage, consider setting-up a grid to keep track
of Hull points. Whilst hits with an Effect of six or more are automatic
critical hits, ships also incur a structural critical hit for every 10% of the
Hull consumed by damage. For example, an undamaged Type-A free
trader has 80 Hull points at the start of combat, as shown on the Free
Trader Hull table:
```

```
Free Trader Hull
Hull Points Remaining Structural Critical Hits
80 0
72 1
64 2
56 3
48 4
40 5
32 6
24 7
16 8
8 9
```

```
Every eight points of damage taken incurs a structural Critical Hit. The
grid can be used to keep track of them.
```

```
Missile damage is determined differently and is resolved after the Actions
Step to provide an opportunity for point defence and countermeasures.
Refer to Missile Combat in the Traveller Core Rulebook for details.
```

```
127
```

**CALLED SHOTS**
Ships at a range of Short or less may attempt to make called shots with
direct-fire weapons (not missiles or torpedoes). The attacker nominates
the location they wish to target and makes an attack roll with DM-2. If the
attack is successful and scores a critical hit, the attacker may choose
which location is hit.

ACTIONS

The spacecraft have moved into position and battle has been joined. Up
to this point, all of the actions in the Space Combat sequence have been
performed by the pilot and gunners. The Actions step brings the rest of
the crew into the fight.

The captain may make a Leadership check to increase a ship’s Initiative for
the next round only, adding the Effect of the Leadership check to Initiative.

```
Astrogation, plot a course for early jump. Engineering personnel,
report for damage control. The jump drive has taken a hit.
Sensors, break that lock or we’re done for! We have to make a
run for the jump point.
```

The engineer may perform a number of actions during this step; shutting
down systems for power conservation, repairing damaged systems,
overloading drives or engaging the jump drive if the astrogator has
provided a course. Note that the engineer gets only one action per turn
and must choose what to do.

The sensor operator detected enemy combatants but now the ships are
in battle, they may enhance the ship’s combat performance by obtaining a
sensor lock, which greatly enhances the gunners’ ability to hit an opposing
ship or performing electronic warfare, which jams communications. Note
that a sensor operator may also use the electronic warfare action to
break sensor locks made by the opposing ship. Just like the engineer,
the sensor operator may perform one of the above actions per round.

If one ship has disabled another or closed the gap to Adjacent range and
the pilot has performed a successful docking action during the Maneuver
step, marines may perform boarding actions. Boarding actions may be
abstracted using the rules on page 163 of the Traveller Core Rulebook
or played out using the combat rules.

128

```
Finally, crew members may be reassigned to another task aboard the
ship, provided they have not already performed tasks during the combat
round. If a Traveller has already performed a task during the round, it
requires one full round for the reassignment to occur.
```

```
Missile combat is resolved after targeted ships have the opportunity to
perform point defence or use countermeasures. Note that the Gunner
skill is not used when determining whether a missile hits its target. After
all point defence turrets and countermeasures have had an opportunity
to remove missiles from a salvo, the number of remaining missiles is
used as the DM for the attack roll. Roll damage as normal, removing
armor from the total and multiply the total by the Effect of the attack roll.
```

```
CLOSE RANGE
When the range is closed to Close or Adjacent, dogfighting rules are
applied. Sensor information at this range is extremely detailed and
combatants enter an intense and probably brief bout of combat that
usually ends up with one ship or the other being subdued. Combat rounds
are reduced from six minutes in duration to six seconds and dogfighting
modifiers are applied.
```
