# Commonality of Kedzudh

Loose interstellar government in the Vargr Extents. The Cornmonality dates from [[IY1044]], when several world governments joined together in an attempt to suppress piracy. The Commonality government has limited powers of taxation; government institutions include a small navy, police force and a university. Individual worlds conduct their own interior and exterior relations.
