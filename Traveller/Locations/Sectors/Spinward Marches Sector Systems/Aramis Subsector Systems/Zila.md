Zila, an agricultural world famous for its wines. is described in #First Call at Zila]] and [[#Zilan Wine]].

Zila (0508-E25672C-7) is a small world with a thin atmosphere and seas covering more than half its surface. Three major continents cover its southern hemisphere. while one rnaior continent is in the northern hemisphere. Zila's population is 66 million distributed mainly on the southern continents. The local government is a participatory democracy, but with an extremely limited electorate. Suffrage is limited to land owners, and even then only to those who hold 1.000 or more acres. In fact, a parcel of land consisting of 1.000 acres is seldom broken up once owned, and is referred to commonly as a "ballot". Families holding several "ballots" generally distribute them among the family members. Zila's [[LawLevel C|law level]] is high, but is an accepted fact of life. The planet's tech level is [[TechLevel 7|TL-7]], lower than average, but sufficient to make life comfortable. Zila is an agricultural world with a trading station to encourage exports to the [[Vargr]].

## Leaving the Starport

At the starport boundary gate, the guard insists that each character read and sign a warning placard before leaving the grounds. The placard cautions that Zila is considered an [[Amber Zone|amber travel zone]], and that individuals venturing into the world outside place themselves in potential danger. Zilan [[LawLevel C|law level C]], sufficient for individuals to be detained on slight pretext; local legal machinery is slow and often tedious. Individuals are cautioned to exercise extreme care on Zila lest they fall afoul of the law. The official indicates that quite a few travellers languish in Zilan jails; it would be prudent to retain a lawyer before any trouble came up.

## Transport Station

Just outside the starport gate is a transport station; regular trains carry travellers and workers the few kilometers to the city. Billboards and signs around the station exhort the virtues of certain law firms, promising immediate attention to any problem and fast results in the event of arrest. Several offices are staffed in the station.  Visiting one of the law offices reveals that it is a recruitment office: the actual law offices are in the city, In the office, a clerk stands ready to sign up individuals for standby legal coverage. For Cr100 per week per person. the law firm will provide legal representation and intercession in the event of problems with the police. An additional Cr70 per week provides a waiver of additional costs that might be necessary, such as bail, gratuities, and filing fees.

If anyone signs up. the clerk will provide each client with a small collar button and warn that it should be worn at all times. He says that it alerts the police that legal coverage is available. He points to his own collar button and says he is never without it. A small identification card provides communicator code numbers and contact names in the event that there is a legal problem.

## Crescence

The [[Class E Starport]] facility on Zila offers very little in the way of entertainment or distractions: most starship crews and trading station personnel visit any of several bars in the Startown district of Crescence. The strip is essentially similar to other Startown districts on other worlds. though it is smaller than many. But it's still a place where visitors go to have a good time, and where the enforcers travel in squads, not pairs.

### The Dead Spacer

A bar, recommended by starport personnel, readily identified by the painted picture of a vacc-suited figure. his faceplate shattered. which hangs over the door. Most visiting ship crews go there; it's a clean place with a friendly atmosphere and a pretty fair understanding with the enforcers.
