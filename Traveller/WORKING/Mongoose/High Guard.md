Our science and our technology have posed us a profound question:
will we learn to use these tools with wisdom and foresight before it’s
_too late? Will we see our species safely through this difficult passage_
so that our children and grandchildren will continue the great journey
of discovery still deeper into the mysteries of the cosmos?

That same rocket and nuclear and computer technology that sends
our ships past the farthest known planet can also be used to destroy
our global civilisation. Exactly the same technology can be used for
good and for evil.

It is as if there were a god who said to us: ‘I set before you two ways.
You can use your technology to destroy yourselves, or to carry you
to the planets and the stars. It’s up to you.’

- Carl Sagan

# I NTRODUCTION

Welcome to High Guard Update 2022.

This book is a major expansion for Traveller, enabling
you to design, build and fly spacecraft of all types
found throughout the galaxy. You will find rules to
modify existing ships, design high-performance space
superiority flyers and build gargantuan capital ships to
travel the space lanes.

High Guard also presents new approaches to handle
spacecraft operations, from engaging in vicious
boarding actions to spacecraft security, from employing
a range of warheads in missiles to accessing
technologies seen in science fiction settings beyond
Charted Space. Your warp drives await.

With more options and more powerful weapons, High
Guard returns to space combat and provides a rules
framework to use in epic space battles, from spiralling
dogfights involving a handful of lightweight fighters
to the clash of heavily armed battleships across a front
stretching through an entire star system.

THE IMPERIAL NAVY


An interstellar community operates under many
restrictions, most notably the fact that it consists of
many planets that are like islands in an ocean of
vacuum. Such a society must have control of that
ocean. In the Third Imperium, the force that rules the
space between the stars protects both commercial
transportation and communication vessels and, as a
result, controls all intercourse between worlds. The
instrument of this control is the Imperial Navy.

The seat of government for the Third Imperium is at
Capital, an industrial and technological powerhouse,
but due to the sheer distances and travel times
involved within its star-spanning realm, the Imperial
Navy is unable to be everywhere at once. As a result,
the Imperium grants a large degree of autonomy to
its subject worlds, demanding only that they abide by
Imperial law and contribute to a united front against
outside forces.

Local provinces (subsectors) also maintain their own
navies, as do individual worlds that have the means
to do so, all subject to the authority of the Emperor
and the Imperial Navy. This three-tiered structure of
Imperial, subsector and planetary navies produces
a flexible system for patrolling space, while putting
the limited resources of the Imperium to best use.
High Guard deals with the navies of the Imperium, of
subsectors and of worlds.

THE SHIP’S LOCKER
Every ship has a ship’s locker, usually located
near an airlock, cargo bay or the bridge, for the
convenience of the crew. Typical equipment
within includes protective clothing, vacc suits,
weapons such as shotguns, pistols and cutlasses,
ammunition, compasses and survival aids, and
portable shelters. The contents of the locker are
defined by the Referee only when needed but
they always contain vacc suits and other useful
items. The ship’s locker is usually protected by a
biometric lock keyed to the ship’s officers.

Abusing The Ship’s Locker
The purpose of the ship’s locker is to provide
useful mundane equipment on demand so
Travellers do not have to keep track of every
single flak jacket and toolkit. It is not an
inexhaustible supply of free stuff, nor is it a
magic box that produces whatever the Travellers
happen to need at any given moment. Referees
should sternly refuse any unreasonable requests
regarding the contents of the ship’s locker – it is a
tool to simplify bookkeeping, nothing more.

HIGH GUARD


Refuelling operations for a task force are dangerous,
as forces that are low on fuel and manoeuvring in
a gravity well are especially vulnerable. The High
Guard position, so named because the ship or ships
involved are higher in the gravity well than their
companions, is used to mount protective operations
during such manoeuvres.



The sheer size of the Imperium precludes the navy
from concentrating its forces in one place – if war
broke out on one border of the Imperium, it would be
months before news reached the capital, and long
months more before the navy could respond. Instead,
there are one or more Imperial fleets for each sector,
named for that sector.

The Imperial Navy is a tool for diplomacy and conquest
as needs dictate; the Emperor’s own sabre. The
Imperial Navy has some of the largest and most
powerful vessels in space – dreadnoughts, battle
tenders and other mighty warships.

SUBSECTOR NAVIES


Each subsector maintains its own fleet of ships,
composed normally of cruisers, escorts, frigates and
smaller auxiliary ships. Subsector navies are primarily
responsible for defence, patrol of the spaceways
and safeguarding trade and commerce within their
subsectors. In wartime, each subsector is required to
put a fraction of its ships at the disposal of the Imperial
Navy to act as reserves and reinforcements.

PLANETARY NAVIES


Planetary navies are responsible solely for the defence
of their home system or a handful of related systems
held by the same noble, usually a duke or count. At
minimum, a planetary navy protects the space up to
the main world’s jump limit but, in most systems, it has
bases in orbit of the main world and the gas giant, as
well as a presence at any inhabited worlds or asteroid
belts. Planetary navies tend to be eccentric at best –
officers are often retired or cashiered command staff
from the subsector navy, poorly educated locals using
out-of-date tactics and third or fourth sons of noblemen.
The equipment is equally eclectic – a combination of
local designs, antiques and monitors.

IMPERIAL NAVAL OPERATIONS


Naval vessels generally operate in task forces or
squadrons, rather than alone; the merits of each
individual ship supplement and complement the others
in company with it. Squadrons are given a numerical
designation when they are created, which are tacked
onto the squadron type to give their full squadron name.
A BatRon given the designation 175 would be known
as BatRon 175 or the 175th BatRon. The squadrons are

also prefixed with a classification dependant on what
part of the fleet they serve with. A front-line regular fleet
unit would have the classification ‘Imperial’ prefixed; a
planetary squadron is usually referred to as a colonial
squadron and prefixed ‘Colonial’. Reserve squadrons
are considered to be part of the regular fleets and keep
the Imperial classification.

Battle Squadrons (BatRons) are built around
dreadnoughts and battleships, and are designed to
smash through enemy lines and engage other Battle
Squadrons. Auxiliary craft attached to a BatRon are
limited to a few fuel tankers and fast-moving tenders
and couriers, and must stay out of the line of fire when
dreadnoughts clash.

Cruiser Squadrons (CruRons) have a core of cruisers
accompanied by escorts and frigates. These are the
workhorses of the Navy, given assignments such as
holding captured systems, interdicting or bombarding
enemy worlds, supporting the Battle Squadron advance
or harassing enemy supply lines.

Assault Squadrons (AssaultRons) have the duty of
capturing enemy worlds and are made up of ortillery
ships and troop transports. Often, a naval force can
take control of space but face significant resistance
on the ground and the only way to hold a world is to
occupy it with soldiers.

SYSTEM DEFENCE BOATS AND MONITORS


A considerable percentage of any starship is
taken up with jump engines and fuel tanks. This
means that a non-jump-capable ship can defeat
a starship of equal or even considerably greater
tonnage. System Defence Boats are 200- to
500-ton patrol boats used for planetary defence.
Monitors are the same concept on a capital scale

- a monitor is a multi-thousand-ton warship with

the bulk of its tonnage allocated to weapons
and manoeuvre drives. Many monitors are
constructed from planetoids, or by stripping the
jump engines and fuel tanks from an outdated
warship hull. It is very rare for a brand-new
monitor to be built using modern technologies,
although especially important worlds can justify
such protection. Sector capitals are sometimes
protected by such ‘supermonitors’.

Introduction

Carrier Squadrons (CarRons) are made up of tenders
or carriers – single large ships that carry well-armed
smaller ships that actually do the fighting when battles
are joined. Fighter carriers transport large numbers of
high-performance small craft in the 10- to 50-ton range.
Battle tenders are often 100,000 tons and up, and
transport several jump-incapable battle riders that may
themselves be 10,000 tons or more.

The points of greatest danger to carried squadrons are
immediately prior to jump (when the craft or ships have
been recalled) and just after returning to normal space (when the craft have not yet been launched).

Tanker Squadrons (TankRons) are mostly composed
of huge fuel tankers, which carry the millions of tons
of hydrogen fuel needed by a jump-capable fleet.
As such vessels are very vulnerable, a TankRon
is normally led by a cruiser and accompanied by
numerous armed escorts.

Scout Squadrons (ScoutRons) are rarely maintained
fulltime by the navy but are assembled as needed.
ScoutRons are made up mainly of ships borrowed from
the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service, together with a
handful of larger fast frigates and stealth ships.

DEFINITIONS


A number of definitions and conventions are used
throughout High Guard, drawn from Charted Space,
other science fiction settings and navies of our own
modern world. The terminology used throughout this
book is consistent and noted here for easy reference.
Note that specific universes might have their own
interpretations of some of these definitions.

**GENERAL**
Ships are measured in ‘displacement tons’ or d-tons:
a 100-ton ship displaces a volume equal to one 100
tons of liquid hydrogen (one d-ton equals roughly 14
cubic metres).

Ship: A spacecraft of 100 tons or more.
Small Craft: A spacecraft of less than 100 tons. Small
craft are incapable of jumping to other star systems.

Capital Ship: A military ship of more than 5,000 tons.

System Ship: A ship without jump drives.

Starship: A ship of 100 tons or more that is capable
of jump travel.

SMALL CRAFT


Boat: A small long-range interplanetary craft,
designed for independent operations.

Shuttle: A large cargo or passenger carrier, used to
travel from orbit to surface and back again.
Fighter: A small, short-ranged fast combat vessel,
normally displacing 50 tons or less.

Bomber: A heavier combat vessel, usually equipped
with weapons capable of damaging a capital ship or
ground-based structures.

Torpedo Boat: A special variety of bomber equipped
with torpedoes.

STARSHIPS


Blockade Runner: A ship designed to be fast
enough and tough enough to force its way through a
formation of enemy ships.

Courier: A small ship dedicated to speed (either in
real space or through large jump distances), allowing
it to carry valuable cargo or personnel quickly.
Q-Ship: A trader, merchant, freighter or other civilian
vessel that has hidden weapons, used to trap pirates
and other raiders.

Trader/Merchant: A small (sub-1,000 ton) ship
dedicated to carrying cargo and passengers.

Freighter: A large (1,000 tons or more) ship
dedicated to carrying cargo.
Liner: A ship dedicated to carrying passengers long
distances in comfort.

Yacht: A pleasure ship, capable of taking a small
number of passengers across space in great comfort.

Introduction



MILITARY SHIPS


Cutter: An armed ship that is both small and cheap.
Cutters are often found in system-defence, antipiracy
or customs roles in the hands of law enforcement or
planetary navies.
Corvette: A larger version of the cutter, sometimes
also capable of making light and fast raids.

Frigate: A small but powerful warship, the role of a
frigate is to roam space away from a fleet, patrolling
borders and attacking commerce. Known as
Destroyer Escorts in Imperial Navy parlance.

Destroyer: Similar to frigates, a destroyer’s main
role is to serve as picket defence for a fleet,
eliminating small ships and fighters before they can
threaten larger ships.
System Defence Boat: Foregoing a jump drive, a
system-defence boat is capable of mounting more
armour and weapons than the equivalent starship,
making it perfect for the defence of a single star
system. The largest are called monitors.

Fleet Escort: Similar in function to Destroyers, but
larger and more capable.

Troop Ship: A flying barracks, these ships are
designed to ferry platoons, companies or entire
regiments between planets.

CAPITAL SHIPS


Cruiser: The mainstay of a fleet, the cruiser is a large
capital ship capable of outgunning anything it cannot
outrun and outrunning anything it cannot outgun.

Light Cruiser: Either a small and fast cruiser, or one
with smaller and cheaper weaponry, intended to fulfil
the cruiser role while keeping to a budget.

Heavy Cruiser: A cruiser with notably increased
weaponry, either in number of guns or their size.

Armoured Cruiser: Where a heavy cruiser has
increased firepower, the armoured cruiser has
increased armour and is capable of standing in the
frontline of battle.

Strike Cruiser: A cruiser designed to operate on its
own or in small squadrons, strike cruisers have a
combination of range, firepower and durability. They
act on their own or at the vanguard of an attack.
Carrier: A general term used for any starship that
carries and deploys numerous small craft, usually
fighters and their equivalents. A light carrier is the
equivalent of a cruiser, while a heavy carrier is
equivalent to a battleship.

Escort Carrier: The escort carrier is designed to
protect small fleets, be they military or civilian, and
is equivalent to a destroyer. Its main weaponry is
carried by the small craft it transports,
rather than the carrier itself.

Assault Carrier: A well-armed and armoured
carrier used to transport large numbers of troops for
planetary assaults.
Fleet Carrier: A very large carrier, often the flagship
of the fleet it travels with.

Battle Tender: A vast carrier that takes battle riders
into battle rather than small craft, allowing them to
engage targets that require jump travel to reach.

Introduction

**FLEET CARRIER**

Introduction

Battle Rider: A large ship, typically destroyer or even
cruiser size, that has no jump engines. They are
intended to be taken into battle in other systems by a
battle tender.

Battleship: A very large capital ship with thick
armour and powerful weapons. Sometimes
called ships-of-the-line, battleships are the
strength of a fleet and are designed to destroy any
enemy they meet.

Battlecruiser: A battlecruiser is similar in size and
role to a battleship but either foregoes armour for
increased speed or speed for increased firepower.

Dreadnought: The largest fighting ships of a fleet,
dreadnoughts are over-sized battleships, fulfilling
the same role but with notably more firepower and
greater durability.

The ship construction system detailed in this chapter
is your gateway to creating your own ship designs
or modifying existing ones, limited only by your
imagination and the laws of physics in the far future.

Spacecraft are large and complicated vehicles, capable
of crossing vast regions of space and unleashing
weapons of terrifying power. The ship design rules
presented here allow you to specify each component
within a spacecraft but make sure to go through
the design process step-by-step. If you get lost or
confused, simply return to the checklist on page 9 to
see where to go next.

Throughout the design process, keep track of two key
numbers – the total tonnage of the ship (and how much
the components you have added have consumed) and
the total cost. The mathematics required to create a
ship are not complex but you may find it handy to have
a calculator close by.

STANDARD DESIGNS



VS. NEW DESIGNS
Some ship designs have been used for centuries and
have become standard across the stars. Plans for such
spacecraft are freely available and components can be
purchased in bulk by shipyards, reducing the cost of
the ship’s construction by 10%. This reduced cost does
not include ammunition for weapons or fuel, which must
be bought at full price.

If a buyer needs a new type of ship, a starship architect
must be employed to design it. The architect’s fees are
an additional 1% of the final cost of the ship.

CONSTRUCTION TIMES


Construction times vary widely, depending on the size
and complexity of the spacecraft and the capabilities of
the shipyard.

# S HIP DESIGN

On average, assume that it takes one day per million
Credits to build a spacecraft at an average commercial
shipyard. At the Referee’s discretion, very large ships
can be built in a modular fashion allowing simultaneous
construction. This means the total construction time can
be reduced by up to 90%. This is typically done only on
ships exceeding 50,000 tons.

High-tech shipyards have superior automation and
faster-working processes, reducing construction
and customisation times. See the Construction Time
Reduction table for the multiple for each Tech Level.

Construction Time Reduction
Tech Level Construction Time
12 90%
13 80%
14 70%
15 60%
16 50%

COSTS


Spacecraft are extremely expensive and once options
start being added, their cost can easily eclipse the
simple designs found in the Traveller Core Rulebook.
The construction of new spacecraft can be funded
using finance options, as detailed starting on page 149
of the Traveller Core Rulebook.

TECH LEVEL


Before you start building your ship, decide on the
Tech Level of the shipyard that will construct it. This
is the maximum Tech Level available for any given
component you add and also serves as the overall Tech
Level of the ship itself.

###### CREATE A HULL

The first step in designing a ship is to build its hull. This
is the body of the ship, its fuselage.

Decide on the total tonnage of the ship. The size of the
hull affects the performance of the ship and, ultimately,
limits what it can carry and achieve. A hull must be a
minimum of five tons and jump-capable ships must be
at least 100 tons. For ease of calculation, use round
numbers; for example, 400 tons, not 425.

Most of the ships that Travellers use are in the 100- to
2,400-ton range. These ships are sometimes called
‘adventure-class ships’ because they are the sort usually
featured in Traveller adventures. Ships in the lower end
of this range might even be affordable by a group of
Travellers who want to purchase their own ship. Ships
above 1,000 tons are usually seen in the backdrop
of a campaign, including everything from a 3,000-ton
destroyer escort on patrol, to a 40,000 megafreighter
making a freight delivery, to an enormous warship of
500,000 tons defending a star system. Naval campaigns
might have a group of Travellers serving aboard a ship
of 50,000 tons or more. For a typical Traveller campaign,
most ships will be 1,000 tons or less.

A basic hull costs Cr50000 per ton. The ship has 1 Hull
point for every full 2.5 tons of hull. This figure is used to
determine how durable the ship is when damaged.

MASSIVE SHIPS


Very large ships require a lot more internal bracing
to support their mass under acceleration but this
has the effect of increasing their durability under
fire. Ships of 25,000–99,999 tons have 1 Hull point
for every 2 tons of hull. Ships of 100,000 tons or
more have 1 Hull point for every 1.5 tons of hull.

The hull configuration chosen for a ship affects its
cost as more complex engineering factors must be
resolved before it can be built, as shown on the Hull
Configuration table. Once chosen, the hull configuration
cannot be changed – it is not possible to retrofit a new
hull configuration.

Streamlined hulls are designed to enter planetary
atmospheres and function in a similar fashion to
conventional aircraft. Partially streamlined and
unstreamlined hulls incur penalties when flying in
atmosphere (see Atmospheric Operations, Traveller
Core Rulebook page 152).

Starting at TL9, all hulls are self-sealing. A self-sealing
hull automatically repairs minor breaches, such as
micrometeoroid impacts, and prevents hull hits from
causing explosive decompression.

Apply any hull cost and Hull point modifiers for the
selected configuration, using the Hull Configuration table.

Planetoid and Buffered Planetoid Hulls: These
require an asteroid to be dragged from its orbit and
hollowed out to be used as the exterior hull of a
spacecraft. This costs Cr4000 per ton but only 80% of
the volume of a planetoid is useable as a spacecraft.
For a buffered planetoid, 65% of the volume is useable.

However, a planetoid’s Hull points are calculated on the
total volume of the planetoid, not the useable space.
Note that planetoid hulls cannot use the specialised or
additional hull types, listed in the following sections:

HULL CONFIGURATION EXAMPLES


Standard: Boxy, cylindrical, series of joined boxes,
possibly with rounded edges. Examples: yacht,
subsidised liner.
Streamlined: Needle, wedge, disc, lifting body,
lozenge, boxy with rounded nose. Examples:
pinnace, shuttle, scout/courier, free trader.
Sphere: Sphere or large spheroid with limited
protuberances. Examples: express boat,
mercenary cruiser.
Close Structure: Boxes joined by sturdy struts
or with multiple projecting elements. Examples:
Chrysanthemum-class destroyer escort, Gazelle-class close escort.
Dispersed Structure: Irregular joined shapes, open
framework, rings. Examples: Donosev-class survey
scout, Lab Ship, Arakoine-class strike cruiser.
Planetoid/Buffered Planetoid : Generally lumpy,
rounded potato shapes. Example: Planetoid Monitor.

HULL CONFIGURATION


The configuration of a hull dictates its shape which, in
turn, affects the capability of the ship. Some ships may
be capable of entering atmospheres, for example, while
others will be destroyed if they try.

SPECIALISED HULL TYPES


Not all spacecraft hulls are built the same way and
it is possible for naval architects to use advanced
construction techniques to make a hull more resilient or,
alternatively, cut costs by using lower-grade materials
and shortcuts during manufacture.

Reinforced Hull: By increasing the cost of a hull by
+50%, a ship can have its Hull points increased by +10%.

Light Hull: By decreasing the cost of a hull by -25%, a
ship can have its Hull points decreased by -10%.

Military Hull: By increasing the cost of a hull by +25%,
a ship may install armour up to double its standard
rating. For example, a non-military hull made of bonded
superdense has a maximum armour value equal to the
Tech Level of the ship, as described in the Hull Armour
table on page 13. However, a ship with a military hull
may add up to double that value in armour. Military hulls
can only be applied to capital ships (greater than 5,
tons) and can stack with the reinforced hull option.

Non-Gravity Hull: Basic hulls include artificial gravity,
using grav plates to ensure a normal gravitational
environment for the comfort and convenience of the
crew. Hulls can be built cheaper without artificial grav
plating, using specific configurations that allow the
hull to constantly spin in order to generate gravity if
desired. Non-gravity hulls reduce hull cost by 50% but
are limited to a maximum size of 500,000 tons due to
structural limitations. Base Power Requirements for
non-gravity hulls are half that of other hull types. See
Power Requirements on page 17 for more information.

ADDITIONAL HULL TYPES


Within the standard configurations, there are a variety
of further options that allow the design of more
complex ships.

Double Hull: This is a two-hulled cylinder where
the outer hull (the whole, or at least a part) spins to
create gravity and the inner hull does not. The outer
hull is kept at around 1G by the speed of its spinning
and is used for any areas that will be inhabited for
extended periods of time, such as crew quarters. The
outer, spun hull must be at least 60 tons. Machinery
to spin a double hull uses 0.1 ton for every ton of
outer hull. For each full percent of the total hull that
is made part of the spun hull, the cost of the hull
must be increased by +1%.

Hamster Cage: This is a series of rings, spun to
emulate gravity. The rings must have a radius of at
least 15 metres in order to simulate a gravitational
field. Machinery to spin a hamster cage uses 0.1 tons
for every ton of spun ring. Unlike other designs, the
hamster cage is usually set at right angles to the hull
and installed in counter-rotating pairs, eliminating
torque effects on the ship’s attitude. For each full
percent of the hull that is made part of the hamster
cage, the cost of the hull is increased by +2%.

Breakaway Hulls: A ship can be designed so it can
operate as two or more independent vessels, breaking
or splitting away from one another. Each section must
have an appropriate bridge and power plant to operate
it. Manoeuvre drive, jump drive, sensors, weapons,
screens and so forth are all options that can (and,
under normal circumstances, should) be included in
each section. While the sections are together, drives,
power plants and weapons can all be combined
when calculating performance. This whole process
consumes 2% of the combined hull tonnage for the
extra bulkheads and connections needed, and costs
MCr2 per ton consumed. Hull points of each section
will be proportionate to the total Hull points of the ship.

For example, you have a 1,000 ton ship and decide
to split it so 400 tons can break away as a separate
vessel. You install 20 tons of manoeuvre drive in the
400 ton section, which gives it Thrust 5, while the 600
ton section has 66 tons of manoeuvre drive giving it
Thrust 9. When combined, this is 86 tons of manoeuvre
drive giving the 1,000 ton vessel Thrust 8. It typically
takes 1D rounds to separate a breakaway hull.

INSTALL ARMOUR


All hulls provide some protection from weapons but it
is possible to add heavier armour for better defence.
All hulls start with armour Protection +0, although this
can be improved upon. Planetoid hulls provide a ship
with armour Protection +2 (Protection +4 if they are
Buffered Planetoids).

The Hull Armour table shows how much of the hull’s
tonnage is consumed per point of Protection added,
along with its costs. A minimum TL is required for each
type of armour and there is a maximum amount that
can be attached to a hull – this includes any armour the
ship had prior to modification.

Apply the Armour Volume Modifier from the Hull
Configuration table to the base armour tonnage.

Ship Design

Hull Armour
Armour TL Tonnage Consumed Cost Per Ton Maximum Protection
Titanium Steel 7 2.5% Cr50000 TL or9 (whichever is less)
Crystaliron 10 1.25% Cr200000 TL or 13 (whichever is less)
Bonded Superdense 14 0.80% Cr500000 TL
Molecular Bonded 16 0.50% MCr1.5 TL+

**ARMOUR TONNAGE AND COST**
Adding armour of any type requires a framework upon
which armour is attached. This framework is more
difficult to apply to small hulls and therefore requires a
greater portion of the tonnage on smaller spacecraft.

EXAMPLE: MAKING A HULL
Assembling a hull can become complicated. First
select the hull size and calculate its base cost.
Then recalculate the cost using the configuration
multiplier. If one of the specialised or additional
hulls are selected, recalculate the cost again,
using the modified hull cost and multiplying it
by the the hull multiplier for the specialised or
additional hull type. Following is an example:

1. The designer decides to build a light cruiser.
   A hull size of 2,000 tons is selected. The cost
   of the hull is 2,000 x Cr50000, which comes
   to MCr100.
2. Despite its fairly large size, the ship is
   intended to make atmospheric landings,
   so the designer selects a streamlined
   _configuration, which makes the hull 20% more_
   expensive. Multiply the hull cost by 1.2, raising
   its price to MCr120.
3. The ship is specialised for military use but
   is not large enough to use the Military Hull
   option, so the designer selects the Reinforced
   Hull option to make it more sturdy. This adds
   _50% to the hull price with the configuration_
   price increase already added in. Multiply the
   _hull cost with configuration increase added in_
   by 1.5, raising its price to MCr180. Note that
   if the ship were larger than 5,000 tons and
   the designer wanted to add the Military Hull
   option as well, they would add the two price
   increases (reinforced and military) together
   _before calculating the final cost of the hull._

After determining basic hull armour Protection (modified
by the hull configuration, if necessary), multiply the
tonnage by the multiplier in the Armour Tonnage table.
Apply this multiplier after the Armour Volume Multiplier
from the Hull Configuration.

For example, when designing a 10-ton light fighter with
crystaliron armour, the Tonnaged Consumed of 1.25%
is multiplied by the Armour Tonnage multiplier of 4. So,
the tonnage consumed for the fighter becomes 5%.

Armour Tonnage
Hull Size (Tons) Armour Tonnage Multiplier
5–15 x
16–25 x
26–99 x
100+ x

Molecular Bonded: This armour is so dense that not
even tachyons can pass through unimpeded. Tachyon
weapons attacking a ship with molecular bonded
armour lose their AP trait.

Breakaway Hulls: Armour can be allocated on a
per-section basis if a breakaway hull is used, in which
case the tonnage and cost are determined as if the
two differently armoured sections of the ship were
different vessels.

INSTALL HULL OPTIONS


Hulls can be further modified with a range of options
to create specialised ships. Each option can only be
added once.

HEAT SHIELDING (TL6)
Heat shielding protects the ship against the heat of
re-entry or close proximity to a star. A ship without a
functioning gravitic drive that attempts re-entry without
heat shielding will burn up. If equipped with undamaged
heat shielding, re-entry is successful on an Easy (4+) Pilot (1D x 10 minutes, DEX) check, with failure
resulting in burn-up (this task is often undertaken at
a slower rate, making it easier). Damage to the ship

Ship Design



from proximity to a star in the absence of heat shielding
is at the Referee’s discretion but should start at 1D
per round, increasing by a cumulative 1D as the ship
gets closer. Heat shielding does not provide protection
against starship weapons. Heat shielding costs MCr0.
per ton of hull.

RADIATION SHIELDING (TL7)
Radiation shielding improves the crew’s protection
against radiation from both natural sources (such as
solar flares and pulsars) and artificial (including nuclear
missiles and meson weapons). A ship with radiation
shielding decreases the amount of rads absorbed by all
crew by 1,000 (rather than the normal 500) and treats
the bridge as if it is Hardened. Radiation shielding costs
Cr25000 per ton of hull.

REFLEC (TL10)
Reflec coating on a hull increases the ship’s Protection
against lasers by +3 but cannot be combined with
Stealth. Adding Reflec costs MCr0.1 per ton of hull.

SOLAR COATING


Solar power can be used to provide a ship’s basic
power needs and – in concert with high-efficiency
battery technology – to provide a high degree of
flexibility for power usage by specific components.
Solar power also serves as a reliable backup power
solution in the event that a ship has its power degraded
due to damage suffered during space combat or other
mishaps. Solar coatings cannot be combined with
any of the other listed hull options except radiation
shielding. Solar coating and extendible solar panels are
described in Solar Energy Systems on page 44.

STEALTH


Stealth absorbs radar and lidar beams, and disguises
heat emissions, applying a negative DM to Electronics (sensors) checks made to detect or lock onto the ship

(see the Stealth Types table). Apply an additional
DM-1 for every Tech Level the ship is higher than the
sensors trying to locate it. At TL8, Stealth consists of
an emissions absorption grid on the hull that nullifies
electronic emissions. At TL10+, Stealth is achieved by
applying a coating to the exterior of the ship and no
additional tonnage is required. See the table below for
the Tech Levels, cost per ton of hull, the DM applied
to Electronics (sensors) checks when trying to detect
the ship and tonnage required. Stealth cannot be
combined with Reflec.

Stealth Types
Type TL Cost Per Ton of Hull Electronics (sensors) DM Tonnage
Basic 8 MCr0.04 DM-2 2% of hull
Improved 10 MCr0.1 DM-2 —
Enhanced 12 MCr0.5 DM-4 —
Advanced 14 MCr1.0 DM-6 —

RADIATION DAMAGE ON LARGE SHIPS


Some ship weapons are capable of dealing
radiation damage to the crew of a target via the
Radiation trait (see page 31 of the Traveller Core
Rulebook). This is simple to apply to low-tonnage
ships but more complex when assessing
damage to cruisers and battleships that mass
in thousands of tons with hundreds or even
thousands of crew members.

To keep things simple, without glossing over the
effects of accumulating radiation damage on the
crew of large vessels, simply apply a cumulative
DM-1 to all actions a ship performs for every
10% of Hull it loses to Radiation weapons. If
the ship has radiation shielding, increase this
to DM-1 every time it loses 40% of its Hull to
Radiation weapons.

If meson weapons are used, ignore radiation
shielding – regardless of the protection the ship
has, the crew will still be getting a full dose of
radiation from these weapons.

Ship Design

###### INSTALL DRIVES

Once you have your basic hull complete, it is time to
start filling it. The first items to add are the engines so
the ship is able to move through space. These include
manoeuvre and jump drives. Manoeuvre drives use
gravitic technology to push the ship through space – it
is these that give a ship its Thrust score.

**STEP 2:**

Ship Design

Reaction drives are similar to manoeuvre drives but
instead act as giant thrusters, exhausting gases that
push the ship forward like today’s rockets.

To fit a manoeuvre or reaction drive, consult the Thrust
Potential table and decide what Thrust score you
want your ship to have. The figure below that Thrust
score shows what percentage of the ship’s hull the
manoeuvre drive consumes, in tons.

HOW MANOEUVRE DRIVES WORK


The primary component of manoeuvre drives
in the Charted Space universe is the thruster
plate. Thruster plates use gravitic technology
to move a ship without the need for exhaust
propellant. When in operation, thruster plates
build up an ionisation field that glows blue. The
higher the thrust employed, the brighter and
more vibrant the blue colour appears.

Another important feature of all manoeuvre-drive systems is gravitic compensators or ‘G
compensators’. These enable a ship to engage
in high levels of thrust without adversely
affecting the crew contained inside. Ships
are typically equipped with enough gravitic
compensation to counter whatever Thrust score
the ship has. Therefore, a ship with Thrust 4 is
also equipped to compensate for 4 Gs of thrust.

Jump drives allow a ship to travel faster-than-light
across interstellar distances. Jump drives create a
bubble of hyperspace by means of injecting high-energy exotic particles into an artificial singularity. The
singularity is driven out of our universe, creating a tiny
parallel universe that is then blown up like a balloon
by injecting hydrogen into it. The jump bubble is folded
around the ship, carrying it into a ship-sized pocket
universe that collapses after about one week, bringing
the ship back into normal space several light-years
from its original position.

SYNCHRONISED JUMPS


When on the offensive, it is advantageous for
every ship in a fleet to arrive at their destination
within a few minutes of one another instead of
appearing in dribs and drabs over the course
of several hours and allowing an alert enemy to
engage the ships of the fleet piecemeal.

Ships within a fleet can synchronise their jumps
so they arrive at their destination within the same
combat round but this takes some engineering
skill and a lot of processing power.

To synchronise a jump, every ship taking part
must have a crew member succeed at a Difficult (10+) Engineer (J-drive) check (1D rounds, INT
or EDU).

If one ship fails in this check, then it may not join
in the synchronised jump. If this happens, the
admiral may choose to jump without it or give the
order for every ship to make the check again,
restarting the whole process. Synchronised
jumps use the same Jump Control software as
normal jumps but the software requires an extra
+5 Bandwidth on top of its usual demands.

MANOEUVRE AND REACTION DRIVES


A manoeuvre or reaction drive with Thrust 0 allows for
an orbiting space station to maintain position but is not
sufficient to move the hull any great distance.

Manoeuvre drive systems include thrusters and gravitic
compensation (also called G compensators). Without
G compensators, the sustained or heavy application
of thrust (or g-force) quickly becomes unbearable
for most sophonts, initially causing discomfort and
eventually unconsciousness, internal injury and death.
Gravitic compensators are limited to the thrust rating
of the ship; for example, a ship with 2G of thrust can
only compensate for 2G of acceleration. Artificial
Gravity uses similar technology but can only be used
to generate internal gravity and does not serve as
a substitute for the G-compensation provided by a
manoeuvre drive.

Manoeuvre drives cost MCr2 per ton. Reaction drives
cost MCr0.2 per ton.

JUMP DRIVES


Jump drives follow a very similar pattern. Select the
desired jump score and use the figure in the Jump
Potential table as the percentage of the ship’s hull that
the jump drive will consume, then add five tons.

A jump drive must be a minimum of 10 tons and they
cost MCr1.5 per ton.

Ship Design

###### INSTALL

###### POWER PLANT

The heart of a spacecraft is the power plant. Typically
fusion-based, the power plant meets all the energy
requirements for every system on the ship, from the
massive amounts required for jump and manoeuvre
drives to the expresso machine in the captain’s
stateroom. Ships are typically built with power plants
large enough to supply energy to all systems on a ship
without interruption, although some cheaper vessels
might require that weapons and other systems are
powered off while making a jump, for example.

The Power Plant table illustrates the types of power
plant available by Tech Level, as well as how much
Power they generate and their cost per ton.

POWER REQUIREMENTS



There are three main requirements a power plant must
meet in terms of Power needed by a ship.

**Basic Ship Systems:** This includes everything a ship
needs for day-to-day operations, including artificial
gravity, heating, lighting and life support. The amount of
Power needed for basic ship systems is equal to 20%
of the total tonnage of the hull.

**STEP 3:**

Manoeuvre Drive: In order to use the manoeuvre
drive, the ship requires an amount of Power equal
to 10% of the hull’s total tonnage multiplied by the
maximum Thrust the drive is capable of (multiply by
0.25 if the ship is capable only of Thrust 0). Note that
reaction drives do not require Power.

Jump Drive: In order to use the jump drive, the ship
requires an amount of Power equal to 10% of the hull’s
total tonnage multiplied by the maximum jump number
the drive is capable of. Only fusion and antimatter
power plants can generate the intense burst of energy
necessary to operate a jump drive. In either case, the
power plant must be used to inject hydrogen into a
jump bubble, so alternative fuels cannot be used. Note
that this Power requirement is only needed when the
ship actually initiates a jump – at all other times, the
jump drive remains inert.

It is considered good practice to ensure there is enough
Power available to use the basic ship systems and the
manoeuvre drive simultaneously – being able to use
the jump drive at the same time without taking power
from other systems is considered a good advantage.
You should also note that most weapons and certain
types of equipment require additional Power, as noted
in their descriptions in the following chapters.

Power Plant
Type Power per Ton Cost per Ton
Fission (TL6) 8 MCr0.
Chemical (TL7) 5 MCr0.
Fusion (TL8) 10 MCr0.
Fusion (TL12) 15 MCr
Fusion (TL15) 20 MCr
Antimatter (TL20) 100 MCr

INTERNAL GRAVITY


Artificial gravity allows Travellers to stand
upright while perpendicular to the plane of
thrust. Ships without this technology require
spinning toruses, linear acceleration or
some other mechanism to simulate gravity.
The artificial gravity system uses similar
technology to that of the manoeuvre drive and
G compensators.



NOT ENOUGH POWER, CAP’N!
There are several ways a ship can run out
of power, from suffering damage in combat
to designs that require certain systems to be
switched off in order for others to function.
Fortunately, ships have many systems that are
less than vital and these can be temporarily
powered down without much loss of function,
as covered on page 179 of the Traveller Core
Rulebook, under Basic Ship Systems.

While the Power required for basic ship systems
can be halved in emergencies, a ship may lack
enough Power to keep just these systems running.

If a ship cannot run basic ship systems at even half
power, the following happens (and the Referee is
free to impose other, perhaps harsher, penalties):
•	 Life support stops functioning efficiently.
While the crew does not freeze or suffocate
immediately, the ship gradually becomes
more uncomfortable. Eventually, the
breathable atmosphere is expended and the
temperature drops to unsurvivable levels,
typically in D3+3 days.
•	 Iris valves, cargo hatches and automatic
doors cease to function, locking in open or
closed positions, just as they were when the
power failed. Manual overrides must be made
and cranks or other devices used to open and
close these portals.
•	 Even if Power can be supplied to the ship’s
computer, individual terminals throughout the
ship cease to function, with the exception of
those on the bridge.
•	 The grav plating throughout the ship ceases to
function, creating zero-G conditions.
•	 Shipboard communications systems (such as
the intercom) cease to function, reducing the
crew to the use of personal communicators
or shouting.

###### INSTALL FUEL TANKS

All ships require fuel to function and the total fuel
tankage for a ship must be indicated in the design
plans. There is no cost associated with space allocated
to fuel tanks but their capacity determines how often
the ship must refuel.

MANOEUVRING


Manoeuvre drives do not require fuel, although reaction
drives do.

The amount of fuel a reaction drive requires is
determined as a percentage of the ship’s total tonnage
and is equal to 2.5% per Thrust per hour.

So, a ship capable of Thrust 4 requires 10% of the
ship’s tonnage as fuel for every hour of use. If you
wanted this ship’s reaction drive to be able to function
for four hours, it requires 40% of its tonnage to be
allocated as fuel tanks.

In combat, it is convenient to multiply the Thrust the ship is
capable of by the number of hours it can operate and then
multiply that again by 10 to obtain a Total Thrust. Because
there are 10 combat rounds every hour, you can then
simply deduct every Thrust point the ship uses in combat
from the Total Thrust. When it reaches zero, the ship has
run out of fuel for its reaction drive. Reaction 0 drives
require 0.25 tons of fuel per hour of Thrust.

JUMP DRIVES


The fuel tankage needed for a jump drive is related to the
size of the ship and the length of the jump, as follows:
10% of the total tonnage of the ship, multiplied by the
maximum jump score of the drive. The result of this is the
number of tons that needs to be dedicated to jump fuel.

POWER PLANTS


Chemical power plants require 10 tons of fuel per
ton of power plant for every two weeks of operation.
Other power plants require fuel tankage equal to 10%
of their size (rounding up, minimum 1 ton) per month
of operation. This provides enough fuel for the power
plant for a month (four weeks). This can be extended
further by increasing the fuel tankage for the power
plant (so, doubling it will provides twice the number of
weeks and so on).

**STEP 4:**

Ship Design

**STEP 5:**

###### INSTALL BRIDGE

All ships must have a bridge that contains basic
controls, communications equipment, avionics,
scanners, detectors, sensors and other equipment for
proper operation of the ship. The size of the bridge
varies depending on the size of the ship and can range
from a massive deck with multiple crew positions on a
capital ship to a snug single-seat cockpit in a fighter.

The size of bridge required and its cost are shown on
the Bridges table.

Bridges

Size of Ship Size of Bridge
50 tons or less 3 tons
51–99 tons 6 tons
100–200 tons 10 tons
201–1,000 tons 20 tons
1,001–2,000 tons 40 tons
2,001–100,000 tons 60 tons
100,001 tons+ +20 tons for every additional
100,000 tons of ship

The cost of any bridge is MCr0.5 per 100 tons (or part
of) of the ship it is installed within.

SMALLER BRIDGES


It is possible to install a smaller bridge than a ship
should normally have. This is usually done to save
space or money.

A ship can have a bridge one size smaller than
the Bridges table indicates, halving the cost of the
bridge. For example, a 100-ton scout could be built
with a six ton bridge.

A ship with a smaller bridge suffers DM-1 for all checks
related to spacecraft operations made from within the
bridge (for example, Astrogation and Pilot checks).

COMMAND BRIDGES


A command bridge is used by ships that lead
squadrons or entire fleets, where the control of large
regions of space and management of multiple ships is
critical. A command bridge adds 40 tons to an existing
bridge, can be used by any ship of more than 5,
tons and adds an additional MCr30 to the cost of the
bridge. The command bridge grants DM+1 to all Tactics (naval) checks made within it.

COCKPITS


Instead of a bridge, ships of 50 tons or less may install
a cockpit. This is a self-contained, sealed area that
contains a single seat and all controls necessary for
the operation of the ship. Cockpits are typically entered
via an external hatch or canopy; therefore, ships using
them do not automatically include an airlock.

A cockpit consumes 1.5 ton of space and costs Cr10000.

A dual cockpit provides space for an additional crew
member, such as a sensor operator or gunner. This
consumes 2.5 tons of space and costs Cr15000.

A cockpit is not designed for long term use and only
has life support for 24 hours.

Ship Design



###### INSTALL COMPUTER

Every ship needs a central computer, usually installed
near the bridge. The computer is the heart of the ship,
controlling all functions from life support to the complex
calculations needed to perform a jump.

Computers are identified by their model number and
the Computers table indicates their price, capacity
and Tech Level. In general, larger and more powerful
computers are advantageous in combat. The
computers installed in a ship work just like personal
computers (see the Traveller Core Rulebook page
110) but are considerably more powerful because the
software needed for ship operations requires a great
deal of processing power (see The Ship’s Computer on
page 73).

Computers
Processing Tech Level Cost
Computer/5 7 Cr30000
Computer/10 9 Cr160000
Computer/15 11 MCr2
Computer/20 12 MCr5
Computer/25 13 MCr10
Computer/30 14 MCr20
Computer/35 15 MCr30

Computers do not consume any tonnage on a ship

- while they do have a physical presence, they are

distributed throughout the ship and considered part
of other components such as the bridge, staterooms

**STEP 6:**

and drives. A ship may have a maximum of two
computers (a primary and a backup) but the second
must have a lower Processing score than the
primary. The primary and backup computers cannot
be operated simultaneously.

COMPUTER CORES


Most capital ships, and certain specialised vessels,
have multiple distributed computer networks spread
throughout their decks but always include a central
computer core that controls the ship’s jump drive.
These are extremely powerful computing systems with
massive amounts of processing power available.

Computer Cores
Processing TL Cost
Core/40 9 MCr45
Core/50 10 MCr60
Core/60 11 MCr75
Core/70 12 MCr80
Core/80 13 MCr95
Core/90 14 MCr120
Core/100 15 MCr130

The Processing score for a computer core is in addition
to the processing power needed for Jump Control
programs, with all Jump Control software included in
the price of the core. Other software must be added at
extra cost as normal.

COMPUTER OPTIONS


There are two additional options to consider when
fitting a ship’s computer:

Jump Control Specialisation (/bis): A computer’s
Processing score is increased by +5 for the purposes
of running Jump Control programs only. This increases
the computer’s cost by +50%.

Hardened Systems (/fib): A computer and its
connections can be Hardened against attack by
electromagnetic pulse weapons. A hardened computer
is immune to Ion weapons but costs +50% more.

Both options can be applied to the same computer by
doubling its cost (+100%).

COMPUTER TECH LEVELS


Note that the listed Tech Level of a computer is
the minimum at which a given computer model is
available. The operating Tech Level is that of the
starship in which it is installed; therefore, ships can
use software limited to the Tech Level of the ship,
not the computer. For example, a TL12 trader can
use TL12 software even on a Computer/5.

Ship Design

###### INSTALL SENSORS

All ships come equipped with basic communications,
sensor and emission-control suites, usually as part
of their bridge. However, specialised or military ships
often benefit from more advanced systems that are far
more sensitive and resistant to jamming.

**STEP 7:**

**STEP 8:**

###### INSTALL WEAPONS

Military ships use a broad range of weaponry to project
power but even a humble merchant or scout might find
a weaponised turret a useful addition when straying
into rougher star systems.

Weapons are installed in the same way as components,
taking note of the tonnage they consume within the hull
and their cost. Most weapons also have a Power cost
associated with them, so you should ensure your power
plant is large enough to handle all the needs of the
spacecraft after weapons have been installed.

Specific details of weapons (and defensive screens)
and how they are installed in a ship can be found in the
next chapter.

The DM column in the Sensors table is applied to all
Electronics (comms) and Electronics (sensors) checks
made by crew in the ship. All ships have Basic sensors
unless upgraded.

###### INSTALL

###### OPTIONAL SYSTEMS

There are a multitude of optional systems, components
and other accessories that can be added to a ship.
These are covered in the Spacecraft Options chapter,
page 43.

Note that most of these optional systems consume
tonnage and some also require Power, both of which
must be carefully considered in ship designs.

**STEP 9:**



Ship Design

###### DETERMINE CREW

All ships, regardless of their Tech Level and automation,
require crew on board to run each system and perform
necessary duties. The smallest of ships can get away
with just one or two multi-skilled individuals but the
largest capital ships may need thousands.

The Crew Requirements table shows how many crew
are needed for a commercial or adventuring ship and
how many are usually found on a military vessel. Salary
can vary but the values on the Crew Requirements
table shows a monthly average for skill level 1 crew,
with the presumption that +50% will be added for every
skill level above this.

Note that these are the crew levels a ship should have.
When Travellers get their hands on a ship, they may
want to do things a little differently and this is handled
as described in Small Star Ships below.

SMALL CRAFT


Ships of 100 tons or less that do not possess a
jump drive typically have a single pilot. The journeys
undertaken by such ships are generally short and it is
assumed that regular maintenance removes the need
for mid-voyage engineering.

Specialised small craft, such as those engaged in
scientific work or with separate weapon stations may
function more efficiently with more crew but they are
not strictly necessary for the operation of the ship.

SMALL STARSHIPS


Spacecraft in the hands of small-time traders or
adventurers usually run with a bare minimum of crew,
with personnel often fulfilling more than one role as
situations demand. For example, it is common on a
smaller ship for the pilot to also act as the astrogator,
or a steward to have basic medical skills. This keeps
the monthly salary bill low and increases what might
otherwise be very slim profits.

**STEP 10:**

Ships of less than 1,000 tons can, in theory, be run
by just one or two multi-skilled people,but the ship will
be at a serious disadvantage in high-stress situations
such as combat. The crewman acting as pilot will likely
be kept busy in the bridge, actually flying the ship,
while another might find their attention split between
engineering, damage control and the weapon systems

- a quick look at the Crew Duties section on page 164

of the Traveller Core Rulebook demonstrates how
inefficient this can be.

Note that smaller craft carried by a ship may have
their own crew in addition to those necessary for the
mother vessel.

LARGE SHIPS


The number of crew required to effectively operate a
ship increases enormously with the size of the vessel,
but large ships have more efficient centralisation
of systems. For ships of more than 5,000 tons, the
Referee can reduce the required crew by multiplying
the crew complement by the Crew Reduction Multipler
in the Crew Reduction table. For example, for a 10,000-ton ship, multiply the total crew by 0.75 to get the final
total number of required crew for a given position.

Crew reductions can only be applied to the following
roles: engineer, maintenance, gunner, administrators
and sensor operators. Calculate officers and medics
after reducing the other roles.

Reduced gunnery staff operate multiple weapons
in batteries which are managed by capital ships’
considerably larger and more extensive computer
networks.

Crew Reduction
Ship Size Crew Reduction Multiplier
5,001–19,999 75%
20,000–49,999 67%
50,000–99,999 50%

Cr5000* 1 per full 20 crew 1 per full 10 crew

- This is presumed to be an average taken across all officer positions on a ship. In practice, it varies a great deal

between junior and senior officers.



###### INSTALL STATEROOMS

Staterooms represent the living space for both crew
and passengers on ships. A single stateroom contains
living and sleeping facilities, including a bed, fresher
and a very basic kitchen.

Each stateroom consumes four tons and costs MCr0.5.
Most ships allocate one person to each stateroom.

DOUBLE OCCUPANCY


Some ships have bunks in their staterooms rather than
single beds, allowing two people to share the same
stateroom. This is called double occupancy and is often
done on exploratory ships, privately-owned vessels
and, especially, military ships.

Employing double occupancy on a ship does not cost
anything (which is why many commercial captains
insist on it) but lack of privacy for extended periods of
time can quickly wear on crew not used to it.

LOW BERTHS


A low berth provides suspended animation facilities
for emergencies and low-paying passengers. They
are not always safe to use but take up relatively little
space and power.

A low berth can hold one passenger. It consumes half a
ton and costs Cr50000. Low berths require 1 Power for
every 10 berths or portion thereof.

EMERGENCY LOW BERTHS


These are compact low berth suites, designed to be
used in extreme emergencies, such as if a crewman
develops a medical condition that cannot be cured on
ship or if the ship is stranded for an extended period
of time. An emergency low berth can hold up to four
people in dire circumstances. It consumes one ton,
costs MCr1 and requires 1 Power.

**STEP 11:**

COMMON AREAS AND LIVING SPACE


It is common practice to assign an additional amount
of tonnage, perhaps equal to a quarter of that used for
staterooms, as common areas or general living space.
These are typically recreation areas such as a mess,
canteen or lounge and can provide facilities such as
parks, pools, theatres and so on, for the amusement
and entertainment of visiting crew and passengers.

This is not strictly necessary and ships can and will
vary in this allocation, either increasing it to give crews
and passengers a more luxurious and comfortable
journey or cutting back to give more space to useful
components, at a cost to crew comfort.

Common areas cost MCr0.1 per ton.

COMMON DECENCY


Designing a ship with less than the
recommended common area space is tempting,
especially when space is at a premium and
the designer wants to fit in as many options as
possible. However, ships that do not include a
recreational area for their crews to unwind often
pay the consequences. Crew fatigue can set in
for personnel who have been aboard ship too
long without a suitable place to relax other than
their staterooms. Initially this might be irritability
and a lack of cooperativeness but eventually
could affect efficiency and performance, resulting
in negative DMs on skill checks.

Ship Design

###### ALLOCATE

###### CARGO SPACE

Any space left on the ship that has not been allocated
to other components is considered to be free for cargo.
There is no cost associated with areas designated for
cargo but any cargo or other materials taken on board
the ship can obviously not exceed the tonnage set
aside for cargo.

**STEP 12:**

**STEP 13:**

###### FINALISE DESIGN

Once cargo space has been allocated, the design
process has been completed – your ship is now
ready to fly.

Add up the tonnage consumed by all components
to ensure that the available space has not been
exceeded and add up the prices of all components
to determine the cost of the ship. If the ship must be
revised, now is the time.

Once everything has been double-checked,
record all the details of the ship on a handy sheet,
downloadable from the Mongoose Publishing
website. Optionally sketch out a deck plan using the
guidelines found on page 100.

Determine the monthly maintenance cost of the ship by
taking the total cost of the ship (after the 10% discount,
if applicable) and divide this figure by 12,000.

Calculate the monthly life support cost. This might be
more difficult on ships belonging to Travellers, since
the number of people on board can vary, but such
ships are generally small enough that this is not a
burden to calculate on a month-to-month basis.

With that step complete, the ship is now ready for the
Travellers to walk onto the bridge, take command and
set sail for the stars!

AIRLOCKS


Airlocks are sealed systems consisting of two
heavy-duty doors or iris valves, with atmospheric
pumping equipment, allowing transit to and from
a spacecraft in a vacuum or hostile atmosphere.
A ship may have one airlock for every full 100
tons at no additional expense. Additional airlocks
may be purchased as described in the Spacecraft
Options chapter. The average airlock is large
enough for three people in vacc suits to pass
through. An airlock takes 10 seconds to cycle.
Under normal circumstances, airlocks are locked
down from the bridge and require a Very Difficult (12+) Electronics (computers) check to override
from either the interior or exterior of the ship. An
unlocked airlock can be triggered from outside.

Small craft do not automatically include airlocks.
Additional airlocks may be added as described
in the Spacecraft Options chapter.

CARGO HATCHES


Any area designated for cargo can be given
a cargo hatch of any size but this is not an
airlock. Generally speaking, cargo areas are
capable of being sealed, and so are effectively
one large airlock unto themselves, but this can
cause problems when needing to unload cargo
in a hostile environment. See the description of
cargo airlocks on page 58 for a solution.

# W EAPONS AND SCREENS

From a single-turret laser on a free trader intended to
discourage piracy, to the massive spinal weapons that
battleships are built around, weapons (both offensive
and defensive) are an important component for
many ships. This chapter explores the vast range of
options available to spacecraft architects who want to
weaponise their creations.

It should be noted that all weapons in this chapter are
Spacecraft scale (see Traveller Core Rulebook, page 167).

NUMBER OF WEAPONS


There are only so many weapons that can be attached
to a ship, the limiting factors being the supply of energy,
the stresses imposed upon the hull through the use of
high-powered weaponry and the surface area of a hull
it is possible to cover with weapons.

Spacecraft therefore have a maximum number of
Hardpoints to which weapons can be attached. A ship
has one Hardpoint for every 100 tons of hull. The
Hardpoints table shows how many Hardpoints are used
by each weapon type.

Hardpoints

Weapon System Hardpoints Used
Fixed Mount 1
Turret 1
Barbette 1
Small Bay 1
Medium Bay 1
Large Bay 5
Spinal Mount Weapon Tonnage/100

**SMALL CRAFT**
Ships of less than 100 tons have Firmpoints instead
of Hardpoints. A Firmpoint is a fixed mount, typically
forward-facing but may alternatively point in any
desired direction.

A ship of less than 35 tons has one Firmpoint. A ship
of 35–69 tons has two Firmpoints and a ship of 70–99
tons has three Firmpoints. Beyond this size, ships use
Hardpoints. A firmpoint can hold only one weapon.

One (and only one) Firmpoint can be upgraded to a
single (not double or triple) turret, which may fire in all
directions as normal.

A weapon mounted on a Firmpoint has the following
changes applied to it:

- Weapons of Medium range or less are reduced to
  Adjacent range.
- Weapons of Long or greater are reduced to
  Close range.
- A weapon on a Firmpoint may not have its range
  increased beyond Close by any means.
- Firmpoint range limitations do not apply to missiles
  and torpedoes.
- Power requirements of the weapon are reduced by
  25% (rounding up).
- Barbettes consume three Firmpoints.

SYSTEM DEFENCE AND SENSORS


The Traveller Core Rulebook covers ranges in
space up to Distant but this is still a relatively short
distance in astronomical terms. When constructing
fleets and space stations, Referees may find it
useful to consider ranges above Distant.

When using these rules, Distant covers ranges up to
300,000km, which is the maximum practical range
that attacks can be made. However, it is possible for
sensors to reach further in order to detect incoming
threats. The following new range bands reflect this.

Very Distant (up to 5,000,000km): All Electronics (sensors) checks become Formidable (14+).
Far (over 5,000,000km): At these ranges,
sensors can spot the signature of ships making
jumps (inbound or out) and can determine only
whether a contact is a ship or other similar-sized
astronomical body. In either case, sensors are
only able to determine the size of the contact to
the nearest 10,000 tons.

Immense size is also a factor in detection and it can
be a real trial trying to creep up on a starport with a
dreadnought. Attempts to detect ships of 100,000
tons or greater gain DM+2, while attempts to detect
ships of 500,000 tons or greater gain DM+4.

**CRITICAL HITS ON LARGE SHIPS**
Large ships can absorb a tremendous amount
of damage. During space combat, use the
standard Critical Hits rules from the Traveller Core
Rulebook with the following modifications:

- Ships larger than 2,000 tons ignore critical hits
  from turrets and barbettes.
- Ships larger than 10,000 tons ignore critical hits
  from all weapons except medium and large bay
  weapons and spinal-mount weapons.
- Ships larger than 100,000 tons ignore critical
  hits from all weapons except large bays and
  spinal-mount weapons.
- Spinal mount weapons can always (and will!)
  cause critical hits.

All ships, even the largest, suffer critical hits from
Sustained Damage (see page 170 of the Traveller
Core Rulebook) as normal.

**CRITICAL HITS TABLE FOR LARGE SHIPS**
The Critical Hits table in the Traveller Core Rulebook
works well for ship battles between smaller ships but
when two large ships square off, some adjustments
are needed: cargo, crew and weapons.

Cargo critical hits work well for small ships but not
for large ones of more than 5,000 tons. If the ship
does not have significant cargo space, include
vehicles, small craft, passengers (including low
berths) and other major systems when considering
the effects of a Cargo critical hit. Optionally build
a D6 table for the ship in question. for example,
the D6 table for a large military carrier might be
1–2: fighters, 3: other small craft, 4: frozen watch,
5–6: cargo. Then use the Cargo and Weapons
Critical Hit Severity table to determine the extent
of damage.

If a Weapons critical hit is scored on a large ship
by another large ship, choose randomly between
the weapon systems on the ship. If the weapons
are multiple (turrets, barbettes, bays, point-defence batteries, ammunition storage), use the
Cargo and Weapons Critical Hit Severity table to
determine what has been disabled or destroyed.
For example, if the Referee randomly determines
that the ship’s 100 medium missile bays have

been hit and the Severity is 2, then D3 x 10%
is rolled to determine the percentage of those
weapons that are disabled.

Cargo and Weapons Critical Hit Severity
Severity Result
1 2D6% disabled/injured
2 D3 x 10% disabled/injured
3 1D x 10% destroyed/killed
4 All remaining destroyed/killed
5 All remaining destroyed/killed, Hull
Severity increased by +1
6 All remaining destroyed/killed, Hull
Severity increased by +1

For Crew critical hits on large ships, see the Crew
Critical Hit Severity table.

Crew Critical Hit Severity
Severity Result
1 1% of crew killed/disabled
2 5% of crew killed/disabled; life
support fails in 1D hours
3 10% of crew killed/disabled; DM-1
to all checks unless crew restored
above 90%
4 15% of crew killed/disabled; life
support fails in 1D rounds
5 20% of crew killed/disabled; DM-2
to all checks unless crew restored
above 70%
6 25% of crew killed/disabled; life
support fails, DM-4 to all checks
unless crew restored above 25%

FROZEN WATCH


A frozen watch consists of ‘spare’ crew members
held in low berths until needed. It is presumed
to include representative members of all
departments. When Crew critical hits have been
sustained, the player in control of the affected
ship may choose to revive any number of frozen-watch crew members, who replace disabled or
killed crew members the following turn, thereby
‘repairing’ Crew critical hits.



TURRETS AND FIXED MOUNTS


Turrets and fixed mounts use the same type of
weapons but whereas a fixed mount can only fire at
targets directly ahead of it, a turret rotates and can
engage any target in sight. One turret or fixed mount
may be attached to each Hardpoint on a ship.

Turrets
Mount TL Power Tons Cost
Fixed Mount — 0 0 MCr0.1
Single Turret 7 1 1 MCr0.2
Double Turret 8 1 1 MCr0.5
Triple Turret 9 1 1 MCr1
Pop-Up Mounting 10 +0 +1 MCr1

Up to three weapons may be mounted on a fixed mount (small craft have additional limitations), while turrets
can mount one, two or three weapons, depending on
their type. These weapons need not be of the same
type but only one type may be used in the same attack.

If two or more weapons are of the same type, they
may be fired together. One attack roll is made for all
weapons being fired but each additional weapon adds
+1 per damage dice to the final damage total.

For example, if a triple turret with three pulse lasers is
fired, it makes one attack roll but inflicts 2D+4 damage (two additional pulse lasers each adding +1 per
damage dice).

Turrets and fixed mounts require just one gunner
to operate, even if multiple weapons are mounted
upon them.

Pop-Up Mounting: This can be applied to any turret
or fixed mount. The weapon system is concealed in a
pod or recess on the hull, and detectable only when
deployed. A ship with all its weapons hidden in popup
mounts will appear unarmed to a sensor scan that
focuses only on its exterior.

BEAM LASER


A laser weapon that fires a continuous beam,
allowing targets to be tracked and hit more easily.
Beam lasers are more accurate than pulse lasers
but have shorter range and do less damage. Beam
laser turrets receive DM+4 to attack rolls.

FUSION GUN


An extremely powerful weapon in planet-based
warfare, in space the fusion gun provides hard-hitting
strikes at a reasonable cost. However, it is extremely
power-hungry.

LASER DRILL


This is more of a tool than a weapon, used by belters
to penetrate asteroids in order to reach valuable ores.
Salvagers also use laser drills to gain entry into derelict
ships. However, in an emergency, the laser drill makes
for a potent, if very short-ranged, weapon. The laser
drill suffers DM-3 to attack rolls if used as a weapon.

MISSILE RACK


Although missile racks require ammunition and the
warheads take time to reach distant targets, they
can be very powerful weapons and, when a range of
warheads is available, extremely versatile too. Each
turret with one or more missile racks holds 12 missiles (missile racks on Firmpoints hold four missiles).
The missile rack listed in the table is equipped with
standard missiles.

Turret Weapons

Beam Laser 10 Medium 4 1D MCr0.5 —
Fusion Gun 14 Medium 12 4D MCr2 Radiation

Weapons and Screens

**PARTICLE BEAM**
This weapon fires a stream of accelerated subatomic
particles at a target. It is not only more powerful than
the average ship-mounted laser but some of the
particles it fires easily penetrate ship armour as if it
were not there, irradiating the crew on board.

**PLASMA GUN**
Firing a high-energy plasma stream, this weapon is far
more powerful than equivalent lasers and provides a
good balance between cost and hitting power.

**PULSE LASER**
Using capacitors to discharge its energy in a single
powerful blast, the pulse laser is less accurate than
its beam-based counterpart but has longer range and
does more damage. Pulse laser turrets receive DM+2
to attack rolls.

**RAILGUN**
Using electromagnetic force, railguns accelerate
slug ammunition to fractions of the speed of light,
delivering a heavy kinetic-energy blow. Railgun turrets
contain enough ammunition for 12 attacks each. Each
cannister of railgun ammunition consumes one ton and
costs Cr5000.

SANDCASTER


Although mounted in turrets and of use against
boarders, the sandcaster is primarily a defensive
weapon used to protect ships from laser, energy and
particle weapons. Each Hardpoint-mounted sandcaster
holds 20 sand canisters and costs Cr25000 to refill.
Sandcasters on Firmpoints hold four canisters and cost
Cr5000 to refill.

BARBETTES


Barbettes are effectively heavy turrets. Barbettes
are typically only for military use and not available
for purchase by civilians except under unusual
circumstances. However, there are unscrupulous ports
where they can be obtained on the black market.

A barbette uses a single Hardpoint, and requires the
Gunner (turret) skill but also consumes additional
tonnage inside the ship, as its larger weapons need
more space for capacitors, targeting mechanisms,
ammunition feeds and other components. Like turrets,
barbettes require just one gunner to operate. Most
barbettes consume 5 tons each.

Barbette Damage Multiple 3

BEAM LASER BARBETTE


Beam laser barbettes are essentially heavier hitting
versions of turret lasers. At mid-stellar Tech Levels,
laser barbettes are superseded by more powerful
particle and fusion-based barbettes, especially on
military spacecraft. Beam laser barbettes retain the
advantages and disadvantages of turret lasers but
cannot be used for point defence, as with any other
barbette. Beam laser barbettes receive DM+4 to
attack rolls.

FUSION BARBETTE


An extremely powerful weapon in planet-based
warfare, in space the fusion barbette provides hard-hitting strikes at a reasonable cost. However, it is a
power-hungry weapon.

ION CANNON


This weapon disrupts the systems of the target ship.
Ion weapons are typically used to temporarily disable
enemy ships, stopping them from fleeing or attacking
while a position of advantage can be attained. For this
reason, they may be found on well-equipped pirate
vessels or customs ships.

DAMAGE MULTIPLES


Barbettes, bay weapons and spinal mount
weapons have damage multiples. After a hit is
scored, roll damage, subtracting armour and other
countermeasures from the total. Be sure to subtract
AP from the armour before reducing damage.
Multiply the remaining damage by the Damage
Multiple for the final damage.

Damage Multiples
Weapon Type Damage Multiple
Barbette 3
Small Bay 10
Medium Bay 20
Large Bay 100
Spinal Mounts 1,000

Damage multiples do not apply to missiles
and torpedoes.

Weapons and Screens



WEAPON TRAIT: ION
Ion weapons overload power systems,
temporarily disrupting critical systems on board
a ship without causing permanent damage. This
can give a vital edge in combat while an enemy
ship recovers or force an enemy to surrender
before the disabling attack is followed up by
something far more potent.

Instead of dealing damage as usual, Ion weapons
use the following rules.

When an Ion weapon successfully hits a target,
roll for its damage but ignore any armour the
target possesses. Instead of applying damage to
the target’s hull, it is instead temporarily deducted
from the target’s Power, representing the disabling
effects as they spread throughout the ship, forcing
its crew to reroute power in order to keep the most
vital systems online.

This reduction in Power lasts until the target
completes its next set of actions, in either the
current round or the next.

If the Effect of the attack roll is 6 or more, the
reduction in Power lasts for D3 rounds.

Hardened Systems: If a system is listed as being
hardened (as with /fib computers, for example),
the crew may choose to allocate any Power to
it before any deductions for Ion weapons are
applied. This ensures a hardened system will
always have enough Power to function, provided
that the Power was available before the Ion attack.

WEAPON TRAITS: ORBITAL
BOMBARDMENT AND ORBITAL STRIKE


Orbital bombardment and strike weapons require
the Gunnery (ortillery) skill to use. These traits
reflect weapons optimised to strike ground-based
targets. Also see Spacecraft Damage Scale in
the Traveller Core Rulebook, page 167, which
applies whether these traits are present or not.

Weapons with the Orbital Bombardment
trait suffer DM-12 when attacking any target
that can manoeuvre in space combat. They
suffer no penalty to bombard static orbital
installations such as a shipyard or starport.
Orbital Bombardment weapons do not have the
precision of Orbital Strike weapons, affecting a
significant blast area. When attacking Ground
scale targets, they add Blast 100 instead of the
usual Blast 10.

Weapons with the Orbital Strike trait suffer
DM-8 when attacking targets that can
manoeuvre in ship combat. They suffer no
penalty to bombard static orbital installations
such as a shipyard or starport. Orbital Strike
weapons are precise, lacking the greater
destructive capabilities of Orbital Bombardment
weapons. They do not add the Blast 10 trait
when attacking Ground scale targets.

Weapons and Screens

**MISSILE BARBETTE**
Equipped with multilaunchers, a missile barbette can
unleash a flurry of warheads at a target. A missile
barbette fires five missiles at a time and holds enough
missiles for five full salvos (a total of 25 missiles).
Missile barbettes on Firmpoints consume an additional
two tons of space.

**PARTICLE BARBETTE**
Taking advantage of the increased power efficiencies
and space available to a barbette, this is a much larger
particle weapon than those mounted in turrets.

**PLASMA BARBETTE**
A large plasma weapon, the plasma barbette is capable
of smashing through even well-armoured targets.

**PULSE LASER BARBETTE**
Pulse laser barbettes are essentially heavier hitting
versions of turret lasers. At mid-stellar Tech Levels, laser
barbettes are superseded by more powerful particle
and fusion-based barbettes, especially on military
spacecraft. Pulse laser barbettes retain the advantages
and disadvantages of turret lasers but cannot be used
for point defence, as with any other barbette. Pulse laser
barbettes receive DM+2 to attack rolls.

**RAILGUN BARBETTE**
Railgun barbettes are larger, single-cannon versions
of the railgun turret that fire a larger, more damaging
round. Railgun barbettes contain enough ammunition
for 12 attacks. Each cannister of railgun ammunition
consumes two tons and costs Cr10000.

**TORPEDO BARBETTE**
A torpedo is a heavy anti-ship missile capable of
carrying tremendous destructive force. Torpedoes are
treated in every way like missiles, although they tend
to be a lot more powerful. Each torpedo barbette holds
three torpedoes. The torpedo here is equipped with a
standard warhead. Torpedo barbetttes on Firmpoints
consume an additional two tons of space.

B AYS


For more destructive power than that provided by
turrets and barbettes, weapons bays allow ships to
concentrate a lot of fire from a single weapon system.
However, they do not have the fast-tracking systems
found in turrets and consequently find smaller targets
harder to score hits upon. Bay weapons are strictly
reserved for the military and rarely, if ever, found on
civilian spacecraft.

Bays come in three sizes: small, medium and large.
They require tonnage, Hardpoints and crew as shown
on the Bay Weapons table.

Bay Weapons

Size Tons Hardpoints Crew

Damage
Multiple
Small 50 1 1 10
Medium 100 1 2 20
Large 500 5 4 100

To calculate damage for a bay weapon hit, roll the
Damage shown for the specific Bay, and multiply the
result by the factor shown in the Damage column
above. For example, a Medium Meson Gun Bay would
do 6D x 20 damage.

THE RADIATION TRAIT


When a spacecraft weapon with the Radiation
trait is fired, it inflicts 2D x 60 rads on everyone
within 10 metres of the point of attack. It should
be noted that radiation weapons have shielding
and other safeguards that prevent them from
affecting the gunners who fire the weapon and
other crew in the vicinity. However, Travellers
on the hull of the attacking ship do risk being
affected if they are near the weapon when it fires.

Radiation is simple to apply to low-tonnage
ships but more complex when assessing
damage to cruisers and battleships that mass
in thousands of tons with hundreds or even
thousands of crew members.

To keep things simple, without glossing over the
effects of accumulating radiation damage on the
crew of large vessels, simply apply a cumulative
DM-1 to all actions a ship performs for every
10% of Hull it loses to Radiation weapons. If
the ship has radiation shielding, increase this
to DM-1 every time it loses 40% of its Hull to
Radiation weapons.

If meson weapons are used, ignore radiation
shielding – regardless of the protection the ship
has, the crew gets a full dose of radiation from
these weapons.

Weapons and Screens



All bay weapons suffer DM-2 when attacking targets
of 2,000 tons or less and DM-4 when attacking targets
of 100 tons or less. Missile and torpedo salvoes do not
use these modifiers.

FUSION GUN BAY


Each fusion gun bay mounts one or more massive
fusion cannons, capable of blasting apart small vessels
with a single shot.

ION CANNON BAY


This weapon disrupts the systems of the target ship.
Ion cannon bays allow the focusing of a great deal of
energy, potentially causing even small capital ships
problems when used in sufficient numbers.

MASS DRIVER BAY


Also known as an ortillery railgun, this weapon
fires large, solid projectiles at speeds optimised for
smashing planetary targets. Each bay contains enough
ammunition for six attacks. Extra or replacement
ammunition can be purchased as shown on the Mass
Driver Ammunition table.

Mass Driver Ammunition
Mass Driver Bay Tons/Attack Cost/Attack
Small 2 Cr20000
Medium 4 Cr40000
Large 20 Cr200000

MESON GUN BAY


Meson guns fire destructive beams that make a
mockery of armour and produce intense radiation
effects inside a target. Meson gun bays ignore all
Armour and radiation shielding.

**MISSILE BAY**
Packed full of launchers, a missile bay can unleash
salvos of warheads at a target, overwhelming its active
defences. A small bay fires 12 missiles at a time, a
medium bay fires 24, and a large bay can fire 120
missiles in a single round. Each bay holds enough
missiles for 12 full salvos (so, 144 missiles in a small
bay, 288 in a medium bay and 1,440 in a large bay).

**ORBITAL STRIKE MASS DRIVER BAY**
A mass driver bay specifically intended for precise
attacks against targets close to population centres or
supporting ground forces.

**ORBITAL STRIKE MISSILE BAY**
A missile driver bay specifically intended for precise
attacks against targets close to population centres or
supporting ground forces. They carry and fire the same
number of missiles as other missile bays but cannot

use ordinary missiles, instead using unguided kinetic
missiles that cost Cr150000 for 12, have Thrust 6 and
inflict 3D damage per missile.

PARTICLE BEAM BAY


The use of a bay allows much larger particle beam
weapons to be installed, the largest capable of
terrifying firepower that erodes a ship’s hull and
irradiates enemy crew.

RAILGUN BAY


Although the rounds a railgun uses are low
technology armour penetrators, the weapon itself uses
electromagnetic forces to accelerate them to sizeable
fractions of the speed of light, delivering a high dose
of kinetic energy to the target. Railgun bays contain
enough ammunition for 12 attacks each. Extra or
replacement ammunition can be purchased as shown
on the Railgun Ammunition table.

Weapons and Screens



Railgun Ammunition
Railgun Bay Tons/Attack Cost/Attack
Small 1 Cr15000
Medium 2 Cr30000
Large 5 Cr75000

REPULSOR BAY


Repulsor bays use gravitics to deflect objects – usually
incoming missiles or torpedoes – at great distances.
By reversing the polarity of a repulsor, a ship may also
use the weapon to pull objects towards it. Repulsors so
configured are sometimes called tractor beams.

When used as a repulsor, a successful Gunner (capital)
check removes a number of missiles from any salvo
within range equal to 1D x Effect. Medium repulsor
bays multiply the result by two and large repulsor bays
multiply it by five.

When used as a tractor beam, a successful attack roll
causes no damage to the target. Small repulsor bays
can hold objects of up to 100 tons, medium bays up
to 200 tons and large bays up to 800 tons. Multiple
repulsor bays can stack to hold larger ships. Objects
held by a tractor beam cannot expend Thrust but may
be moved by the tractor beam operator as if they had
Thrust 1. A ship caught in a tractor beam can attempt
to break the lock by making a Pilot check opposed by
the Gunner (capital) check of the tractor beam operator.
Each additional tractor beam holding the ship imposes
DM-2 to this Pilot check and large repulsor bays
impose a further DM-2.

A repulsor can only be used once per round, whether it
is locking onto an object or repelling it. Increasing the TL
of a repulsor bay increases its cost by 10% and doubles
the tonnage of the object it can hold. This increase may
only be applied once. However, a ship may not lock onto
an object of greater tonnage than itself.

TORPEDO BAY


A flurry of missiles will panic any ship’s captain but
a salvo of torpedoes is real cause for concern. The
torpedo bay launches a number of torpedoes with every
attack: three torpedoes for a small bay, 6 torpedoes for
a medium bay and 30 torpedoes for a large bay. Each
bay holds enough torpedoes for 12 full salvos (so, 36
torpedoes in a small bay, 72 in a medium bay and 360
in a large bay).

SPINAL WEAPONS


Spinal weapons are the ultimate in ship-borne
firepower, huge weapons that run the entire length of
a ship. In many cases, a ship will be built around the
weapon itself (hence the term ‘spinal’) and a single
shot from a spinal weapon can cut a lesser vessel
in two. Spinal weapons are specifically designed to
deliver knockout blows against the largest vessels and
surface installations. Consequently, they are extremely
inaccurate when attacking small targets. It goes without
saying that spinal-mount weapons are strictly used by
the military.

Spinal Mount Damage Multiple 1,000

All spinal weapons suffer DM-4 when attacking targets
of 10,000 tons or less and DM-8 when attacking
targets of 5,000 tons or less. Spinal weapons cannot
attack targets of less than 2,000 tons unless they
are stationary or are caught in the blast by accident.
Spinal weapons use a number of Hardpoints equal to
their tonnage divided by 100, rounding up. A spinal
mount cannot exceed a tonnage equal to half that of
the ship carrying it.

In addition, spinal weapons incur negative DMs against
ships of all sizes at Adjacent to Short range. While there
is some degree of directional adjustment that can be
made at the barrel of most spinal weapons, their sheer

MULTIPLE WARHEADS INCOMING!
Once ships start mounting bay weapons, the
number of missiles they can throw at their
enemies increases significantly. When multiple
salvoes of missiles (or torpedoes) are incoming,
even the finest sensor operator can become
quickly overwhelmed. To counter this, large
warships often have multiple sensor stations
operated by several dedicated crew members.

Because of this, assume that a ship has one
on-duty sensor operator for every full 7,500 tons.
For example, a 75,000-ton ship would have 10
sensor operators on duty who could between
them perform the Electronic Warfare action on 10
different incoming salvoes.

For large ships, the Referee may make one roll for
every 10 sensor operators, multiplying the results
by 10 for simplicity.

Weapons and Screens

size and dependency on the movement of the host
ship limits their ability to accurately target nearby ships.
Consult the Spinal Weapon Range Adjustments table.

However, spinal weapons also require vast reserves
of power and naval architects might consider using
high-efficiency batteries to allow a spinal weapon
to be charged over time, rather than requiring a
massive power plant that can deliver the required
energy all at once.

Note that while there are no restrictions preventing a
designer from installing more than one spinal mount
weapon in a ship, it is rarely done in the Charted
Space universe.

Spinal mount weapons are very large and, unlike other
offensive systems, are of variable size. The Spinal
Mount Weapons table shows the effectiveness of a
spinal mount weapon at its Base Size (this is also its
minimum size at the lowest Tech Level the weapon
becomes available).

For every multiple of the Base Size, the spinal mount
increases its Damage, Power consumption and cost
by the amount shown. So, for example, a 15,000-ton
meson spinal mount consumes 2,000 Power, deals 12D
damage and costs MCr4000. Denote the multiple of the
weapon on the ship’s record sheet. For example, for a
TL15 spinal mount meson weapon with a multiple of 5,
display the weapon as ‘Spinal – meson (TL15) – 5x’.

For large spinal mounts, the number of damage dice
can become quite high. To simplify, divide the damage
dice by the desired multiple and then multiply the final
amount by the same number. For example, a 75,000-ton meson spinal mount inflicts 60D damage. Instead

Spinal mounts improve rapidly with technology, while

smaller vessels, as shown on the Spinal Mount

MASS DRIVER SPINAL MOUNT


Used against precise targets, such as large-scale
infrastructure – dams, power generation sites,
spaceports and seaports, and so forth – and industrial
centres, as well as defensive installations. A bracket
impact with deadfall weapons or nuclear detonations
can crack hardened underground structures that
otherwise might be impervious. The intent is to set up
multiple shockwaves that converge on the target and
combine to produce extreme forces. Ammunition is 50
tons and costs Cr500000 per attack

MESON SPINAL MOUNT


A truly awe-inspiring weapon, the dual-particle beams
used by meson spinal mounts can end battles before they
really begin. Meson spinal mounts ignore all armour and
radiation shielding.

Weapons and Screens



PARTICLE SPINAL MOUNT


The largest version of a weapon whose development
started with humble barbette-based systems, particle
spinal mounts are a mainstay of the most powerful
navies. The damage dealt by a particle spinal mount
is reduced by 3% per point of armour possessed by
the target before applying the Damage Multiple.

RAILGUN SPINAL MOUNT


An array of smaller rapid-firing guns, the railgun spinal
mount fires much larger rounds at near relativistic
speeds. The damage dealt by a railgun spinal mount
is reduced by 2% per point of armour possessed
by the target before applying the Damage Multiple.
Railgun spinal mounts come equipped with five
rounds. Extra or replacement rounds consume 20 tons
each and cost MCr0.2.

MISSILES


There are several different types of missiles
beyond standard warheads. Additional missiles
can be purchased for a ship, increasing its stock of
ammunition and missiles can be replenished after use.
Twelve missiles consume one ton. The listed cost is
for 12 missiles.

ADVANCED MISSILE


An advanced version of the standard missile, this
model features improved propulsion and a more
devastating warhead.

only 1D damage.

ANTIMATTER MISSILE


Tipped with an antimatter warhead, these missiles
are devastating enough in the attack but also release
waves of destructive radiation on enemy crews.

ANTI-TORPEDO MISSILE
Taking advantage of the superior speed of missiles
and the Smart trait, these missiles are arguably the
best defence against torpedo attacks. The anti-torpedo
missile has a multiple-component design, featuring a
cartridge that contains the primary propulsion unit and
Improved Sensors for target location. As the cartridge
approaches its target, it launches a smaller, more
nimble missile that uses a secondary propulsion unit
to close the gap with a torpedo salvo, whereupon it
detonates a fragmentary warhead that eliminates 1D

- Effect torpedoes from the salvo during the Reaction

Step of space combat.

DECOY MISSILE


These missiles have a small warhead but sport a pair
of small pods mounted with powerful transmitters and
jammers. These are detached shortly before impact,
confusing point-defence systems. All anti-missile fire
directed at this missile suffers DM-2.

FRAGMENTATION MISSILE


This missile is designed to target small craft. It
explodes shortly before interception, throwing out a wall
of high-velocity shrapnel. When fired in mass barrages,

this dense volley is enough to cripple entire bomber
waves and disperse fighter screens. Upon reaching
a target, the missile will make attack rolls against that
target and up to three others within Adjacent range.

Fragmentation missiles are also an effective counter to
other missiles when targeted at another missile salvo,
reducing the number of missiles within the salvo on a
one-for-one basis. They have no effect on torpedoes.

ships by 2Dx5 x the Effect of the attack. The Effect is
also used to determine how many rounds the Power
reduction lasts.

JUMPBREAKER MISSILE


These missiles create localised gravitational distortions
when they detonate, making the delicate calculations
required for an accurate jump much more difficult. A
ship hit by a jumpbreaker missile suffers DM-8 to any
Jump check (see the Traveller Core Rulebook, page
157) attempted in this combat round or the next.

LONG-RANGE MISSILE
This missile forgoes a large warhead, instead using the
space for greater fuel capacity and a more powerful
motor. Long-range missiles do not reduce their salvo
strength every five rounds.

In addition, when huge salvoes of missiles are in-flight, problems with guidance and motor systems
can become more apparent. Halve the number of
missiles within a salvo for every full five rounds of
travel. Torpedoes have much greater endurance
and ignore this rule.

MULTI–WARHEAD MISSILE
This heavy missile carries multiple warheads, which
detach before impact. This both overwhelms anti-missile
defences (DM-2 to all point defence fire) and causes
more damage. Just before you make an attack roll,
multiply the number or missiles in the salvo by three.

NUCLEAR MISSILE


A powerful missile available at lower Tech Levels, using
nuclear missiles near an inhabited planet or orbit is
forbidden by interstellar law. Nuclear missiles inflict
more damage than standard or advanced missiles and
also have the Radiation trait.

ORTILLERY MISSILE


Specifically designed for planetary bombardment,
ortillery missiles are powerful but too slow to be used
effectively as anti-ship weapons unless the target is
not expecting an attack. See the Orbital Bombardment
and Orbital Strike trait descriptions on page 30 for
more information.

SHOCKWAVE MISSILE


This is a highly specialised missile that carries a
magnetic-pulse warhead. The blast it creates is
harmless to spacecraft but scatters and polarises sand
clouds, rendering them useless in defence. A ship
struck by a shockwave missile cannot benefit from
sand defences for this round and the next.

STANDARD MISSILE


The most common form of missile, which carries a
powerful explosive warhead.

SANDCASTERS


Most sandcasters fire canisters of small particles that
counteract laser, energy and particle weapons fire but
other types of canister are available. Additional canisters
may be purchased for a ship, increasing its stock of
ammunition. Twenty sand canisters consume one ton.

ANTI-PERSONNEL
This canister type launches multiple fragmentation
charges that detonate a pre-set distance from the
target, creating a hail of small fragments that inflict 3D
damage (Ground scale) in a cloud around the targeted
ship. Anti-personnel canisters can be used against
targets in space or on a planetary surface.

CHAFF CANISTER


Sandcaster chaff disrupts sensors and communications
targeted at the ship that creates the cloud. All
Electronics (comms), Electronics (sensors), Electronics (remote ops) checks and attack rolls for missiles made
within a chaff cloud suffer DM-1. Chaff does not provide
protection against laser, energy or particle weapons.

PEBBLE CANISTER


This is designed as a basic offensive round for a
sandcaster. When targeting boarders, pebble canisters
cause 1DD damage (Ground scale). They do not provide
protection against laser, energy or particle weapons.

SAND CANISTER


The standard canister fitted to most casters. Its use is
covered in the Traveller Core Rulebook, page 168.

SANDCUTTER CANISTER


A very short-ranged weapon, the sandcutter fires a hail of
electromagnets into the midst of an enemy sand cloud.
These magnets cause the sand to coagulate, reducing its
effective protection. A sandcutter canister may be targeted
against an enemy ship within Adjacent or Close range and
a successful attack halves the protection given by any
sand canisters the enemy uses that round. It provides no
protection laser, energy or particle weapons.

TORPEDOES


There are several different types of torpedoes beyond the
standard warheads supplied with most weapon systems.

Additional torpedoes may be purchased for a ship,
increasing its stock of ammunition, and torpedoes can
be replenished after use. Three torpedoes consume
one ton. The listed cost is for three torpedoes.

Torpedoes are much larger and more resilient than
missiles, allowing them to punch through point
defences to reach their targets.

A torpedo salvo halves the Effect of any successful
point defence taken against it, rounding down.
However, torpedoes are designed to target larger
vessels and can have trouble making successful
attacks against smaller ships. Torpedo salvoes suffer
an additional DM-2 on their attack rolls against ships
smaller than 2,000 tons.

**ADVANCED TORPEDO**
Manufactured with a more efficient warhead and far
more powerful propulsion system, the advanced torpedo
is the weapon of choice for high-technology fleets.

**ANTIMATTER TORPEDO**
Tipped with an antimatter warhead, this torpedo is
immensely powerful, devastating to both ship and crew.

**ANTIMATTER BOMB-PUMPED TORPEDO**
This torpedo contains a small antimatter device that is
detonated prior to impact, charging a directed particle
beam. Due to the ‘stand-off’ nature of its attack, point
defence against this torpedo suffers DM-2. Defences
that work against particle beams – such as armour –
can be used against this torpedo.

**ANTIRADIATION TORPEDO**
A cunning weapon, the antiradiation torpedo is
designed to home in on the emissions used in
electronic warfare. This gives the target a stark choice;

continue performing electronic warfare and be hit by
the torpedo or shut down all such activities and be hit
by a potentially nastier missile attack. Antiradiation
torpedoes can only make an attack roll against a ship
if it performed electronic warfare in the current or
previous combat round. However, it makes the attack
roll with DM+6. If the ship did not perform electronic
warfare, the torpedo automatically misses.

BOMB–PUMPED TORPEDO
This torpedo contains a small nuclear device that is
detonated prior to impact in order to charge a laser.
Due to the ‘stand-off’ nature of its attack, point defence
against this torpedo suffers DM-2. Defences that work
against lasers can be used against this torpedo.

ION TORPEDO


An expensive but effective solution to the problem
of disabling enemy ships for salvage, ion warheads
operate as described in New Trait: Ion on page 30
including the Effect rules that enable detonations to last
multiple rounds. Successful attacks reduce the Power
of opposing ships by 4Dx10 x the Effect of the attack.
The Effect is also used to determine how many rounds
the Power reduction lasts.

MULTI-WARHEAD TORPEDO
These heavy torpedoes carry multiple warheads that
detach before impact. This both overwhelms anti-missile

NUCLEAR TORPEDO


A basic but powerful weapon, the nuclear torpedo is
used by lower tech navies.

ORTILLERY TORPEDO


Like its smaller missile counterpart, this torpedo is
designed to be launched from orbit against planetside
targets. Like their missile counterparts, ortillery
torpedoes are too slow to be used effectively as anti-ship weapons unless the target is not expecting an
attack. See the Orbital Bombardment and Orbital Strike
trait descriptions on page 30 for more information.

PLASMA TORPEDO


This weapon is fitted with a powerful plasma burner in
the nose and is particularly effective at cutting through
ship armour.

STANDARD TORPEDO


This torpedo consists of a small but powerful propulsion
unit, guidance computers and a fragmentation device
dedicated to kinetic-kill attacks.

SMALLER WEAPONS


It is possible to equip a spacecraft with Ground
scale weaponry. This is usually done on small
craft designed to operate regularly within an
atmosphere while engaging ground targets but
any spacecraft can use them.

Weapons of up to 250 kilograms may be mounted
on spacecraft using 0.25 tons per weapon. They
are attached to fixed mounts on any spacecraft
of less than 50 tons adding Cr5000 to the cost of
each weapon, or small pop-up turrets operated
from a remote station on larger ships at an added
cost of Cr50000 per weapon. Either way, these
weapons draw no Power from the spacecraft since
it is assumed their energy requirements are tiny in
comparison to other systems, and they consume
neither hardpoints nor firmpoints.

Small weapons with a mass of more than 250
kilograms consume an amount of space equal to
their mass, to a minimum of one ton. These must
be mounted in turrets (if they mass one ton or
less) or fixed mounts and consume no Power.

POINT-DEFENCE WEAPONS
A point-defence laser battery consists of linked
short-ranged laser turrets controlled by their own
automated computer. This removes the need for
separate gunners dedicated to point defence, needing
only a command from the bridge to activate when an
incoming attack is detected.

A point-defence battery automatically intercepts
missile and torpedo salvoes just before they make
their own attack rolls. A point-defence battery reduces
the number of missiles attacking a ship each turn by
its Intercept score. This can be applied to any salvo
or spread between several salvoes. A point defence
battery uses 1 Hardpoint.

Point Defence Laser Batteries
Weapon TL Intercept Power Tons Cost
Type I 10 +2D 10 20 MCr5
Type II 12 +4D 20 20 MCr10
Type III 14 +6D 30 20 MCr20

Point-defence gauss batteries are also available but
primarily serve as a defence against torpedo attacks.
They provide equal protection against missiles and
torpedoes with a Thrust of 10 or less but suffer
DM-2 against those with Thrust 12–14 and DM-6
against those with Thrust 15 or higher. Point-defence
gauss batteries require less power than their laser
counterparts but they do require ammunition storage.
Much like sandcasters, each gauss battery may be
fired for 12 rounds before requiring a reload. Each
cannister of ammunition consumes one ton of space,
costs Cr30000 and provides an additional 12 rounds.

SCREENS


Screens are a variety of directed defensive systems
that use various technologies to defeat specific attacks.
For example, meson screens prevent meson decay and
so are targeted against meson weapon attacks, while
nuclear dampers are used against nuclear warheads.

Screens use the Gunner (screen) skill and the Angle
Screens reaction against specific attacks, in a similar
way to the Point Defence and Disperse Sand reactions
in the Traveller Core Rulebook.

Weapons and Screens

SHIELDS


Many universes feature ships capable of generating
shields that deflect or absorb damage. These are
covered in the Exotic Technology chapter (page 79).

MESON SCREEN


Meson screens block attacks from meson weapons by
preventing meson decay. A successful use of a meson
screen reduces the damage of a meson weapon by
2D x 10 and removes its Radiation trait. When used
to ward off a single attack, screens are grouped in
batteries, requiring only a single Gunner (screens)
check for an unlimited number of screens.

NUCLEAR DAMPER


Nuclear dampers project a series of nodes and
antinodes where the strong nuclear force is enhanced
or degraded, rendering nuclear warheads ineffective.
A successful use of a nuclear damper against a fusion
weapon or salvo of nuclear warheads (whether they
are on missiles or torpedoes) reduces its damage by
2D and removes the Radiation trait. Against Destructive
weapons, every five nuclear dampers reduce damage
by 1DD and remove the Radiation trait.

Screens

Screen TL Power Tons Cost
Meson Screen 13 30 10 MCr20
Nuclear Damper 12 20 10 MCr10

ANGLE SCREENS (GUNNER)
Using a screen, a gunner can attempt to deflect
or reduce damage from incoming attacks. The
gunner must succeed at a Gunner (screen) check
against an attack and, if successful, reduces the
damage of the attack – after armour has been
accounted for – by the number of dice rolled by
the screen (as noted in its description), multiplied
by the Effect of the gunner’s check.

A gunner may use any number of screens against
a single attack, combining their dice (but only
multiplying the result by the Effect once). A gunner
may only attempt to Angle Screens once per
round and each screen can only be used once.

BLACK GLOBE GENERATOR


Black globe generators are a special type of screen
that projects an energy-absorbing barrier that shunts
the energy of an incoming attack into capacitors. Any
ship using a black globe generator cannot manoeuvre,
dodge, jump or use weapons or sensors while the
globe is active. All energy aimed at a ship with an
active black globe generator is automatically absorbed,
regardless of its type.

Black Globe generators are only available at TL15 or
above and are not commercially available, tending
to be either recovered artefacts of the Ancients or
exotic (and not necessarily reliable) prototypes.
They are installed either as makeshift defences or
experimental screens on capital warships. These
generators are therefore the jealously guarded property
of governments and empires, and cannot be bought
on the open market. The Referee always has final
discretion on the availability of black globe generators.

Black globe generators consume 50 tons and, when
available, cost at least MCr100. They require 30
points of Power.



ABSORBING ATTACKS


As the energy of attacks absorbed by the generator is
channelled to capacitors, a ship must have sufficient
capacity if it is to avoid overloading its systems
and explode catastrophically. Fortunately, if a ship
possesses a jump drive, it therefore has a considerable
number of capacitors.

A jump drive has capacitors equal to 20% of its size in
tons. Additional capacitors can be purchased at a cost
of MCr3 per ton.

Each ton of capacitors absorbs 50 points of damage.
After a hit is scored, roll damage and apply any
Damage Multiple before determining how much
damage is absorbed

DISCHARGING CAPACITORS


If a ship with a black globe generator absorbs more
damage than its capacitors can handle, the ship
automatically explodes, destroying it instantly.

To avoid this, the capacitors can be discharged. For every
combat round the black globe generator is switched off,
the capacitors discharge an amount of damage equal to
1% of the ship’s total tonnage multiplied by 10% of the
tonnage of the ship’s power plant.

FLICKERING GENERATORS


A black globe generator that is switched on all the
time automatically absorbs all incoming attacks. It also
makes the ship it is protecting effectively invisible to
sensors (since it absorbs all energy, not just that from
weapons). However, the ship is unable to manoeuvre
in any fashion, cannot make any attacks of its own, nor
use its own sensors, rendering it blind.

Note that switching on a black globe generator in battle
does not guarantee the ship can automatically escape
its enemies. Since it cannot manoeuvre at all, it is a
simple task to project its vector and predict its position

when the generator is switched off again, making it
extremely vulnerable (DM+2 to any attacks made
against it if its vector was tracked).

These considerable limitations can be offset by causing
the generator to flicker (switching the field off and
on hundreds of times per second) to give the ship
intermittent protection while allowing manoeuvring,
sensor use and so forth, to take place in the short
periods when the globe is switched off.

The flicker rate is variable and shown on the Black
Globe Flicker table.

Black Globe Flicker
Flicker Rate Attacks Thrust Sensor DM

1 6+ -1 -1
2 5+ -2 -2

3 4+ -3 -3

4 3+ -4 -4
5 2+ -5 -5

6 (always on) — — —

The flicker rate is determined at the start of a ship’s
Manoeuvre Step in a combat round, before any
Thrust is applied.

Every time the ship is attacked, roll 1D. If the dice
roll is equal to or more than the score listed in the
Attacks column for the flicker rate, then the attack is
absorbed by the generator. If it is less, the attack hits
the ship as normal.

The ship’s available Thrust for that combat round is
reduced by the Thrust modifier for the flicker rate and
all sensor-related checks made by or against the ship
suffer a negative DM indicated on the Black Globe
Flicker table. The Sensor DM is also applied to all
attack rolls made by the ship using the generator, as it
has far less time to plot accurate attacks.

Weapons and Screens

# S PACECRAFT OPTIONS

Beyond the basic drives, sensors and weapon systems,
spacecraft can be customised to perform specialised
functions in many different ways, giving rise to an
unlimited amount of variation. These optional systems
are covered in this chapter. While they should be
considered during the design of a spacecraft, most
can be retrofitted to existing designs by any capable
shipyard of sufficient Tech Level.

While most options can be accommodated by any
shipyard capable of building or repairing spacecraft,
some require far more advanced technology, as
denoted by any TL requirement.

STRUCTURE


These options alter the basic framework of the ship and
although they can be retrofitted, expect a ship to spend a
considerable amount of time in a shipyard for installation.

**ARMOURED BULKHEAD**
Armoured bulkheads protect specific areas and
systems, such as the jump drive or fuel tanks, making
them much more resilient to damage.

Adding armoured bulkheads consumes an amount of
space equal to 10% of the tonnage of the protected
item. During space combat, the Severity of any critical
hit to the protected space is reduced by -1 (to a
minimum of Severity 1).

Option Cost
Armoured Bulkhead MCr0.2 per ton

**ADJUSTABLE HULL**
Large sections of the hull consist of bands and strips
that change the hull’s overall shape, making the ship
have the same outline as any other ship of the same
tonnage, hull configuration, hull options and external
systems, including mimicry of attached modules,
although these are non-functional. Other identification
features such as the pattern of reactor and drive
emissions can likewise be adjusted to enhance the
deception. At the Referee's option, this may be limited
to ships of the same general shape: a long and thin

ship cannot mimic a box-shaped ship and vice versa.
Reconfiguration takes one space combat round, during
which the ship cannot fire weapons, dock or launch
other ships or operate sensors. Any sensor close
enough to achieve Full detail can see through the
disguise but by then the ship is well within weapons
range. The primary users of this hull option are pirates
and Q-ships that want to pretend to be something else.
This is also useful when landing in cargo or docking
bays of unusual shape or size. All weapons, not just
turrets, on such a ship have pop-up mountings at no
additional cost.

PRESSURE HULL


Intended primarily for gas giant research vessels, a
pressure hull is designed to withstand incredibly high
pressures. Components within the pressure hull are
protected from damage, as is the hull itself, to a far
greater depth than normal when skimming fuel.

If the gas giant operations rules from the Traveller
Companion are being used, the ship suffers no ill
effects when operating in the Extreme Deeps zone. If
the vessel enters the Depths zone, it will be unharmed
for 2D hours, after which the pressure hull will begin to
fail on a roll of 8+ on 2D, made every 1D hours. Once
the pressure hull begins to fail, the ship takes normal
damage (2D per round) and the pressure hull will need
extensive repair work if the ship survives. If these rules
are not used, assume the ship can descend to a level
in a gas giant that makes it undetectable to ships in
orbit. A vessel with a pressure hull can also operate at
depths of 50 kilometres underwater; far deeper than the
oceans of most worlds.

A pressure hull consumes 25% of the vessel’s tonnage
and costs 10 times the normal hull cost. It is considered
to have intrinsic Armour +4.



MODULAR HULL


A portion of a ship’s hull may be designated as
modular, allowing it to be swapped out easily for
another module. This allows a ship to be configured for
specific missions and roles. For example, a modular
ship may have modules for missile bays (making it
a missile carrier), laboratories (to act as a research
vessel) or hangar space (allowing it to transport smaller
ships). The practice of using modules is more common
among small craft but there is no theoretical maximum
size to the ship that can use them.

Up to 75% of a ship’s internal tonnage can be
designated as modular. This tonnage cannot include
the bridge, power plant, drives or any structure or
armour options. Calculate Firmpoints or Hardpoints
separately for the main hull and any module but the
total cannot exceed the total number that would be
allowed for a non-modular ship.

Making a modular hull increases the cost of the overall
hull by the percentage designated as being modular. For
example, a 100-ton hull normally costs MCr2. If 30% of
the ship’s hull is to be made modular, then the cost of the
hull is increased to MCr2.6, which is 130% of the original
cost. This results in 30 tons of the ship’s components
being easily swapped out from mission-to-mission.

MODULE


Hull modules are cheaper to build than regular
hulls because they are not designed to operate as
independent spacecraft. Options may be added to hull
modules as normal.

Option Cost
Module Cr25000 per ton

POWER


A variety of options can be applied to a ship’s power
systems, normally for emergency use.

EMERGENCY POWER SYSTEM


An emergency power system allows a ship to keep
functioning even when its main power plant has been
taken completely offline and is a cheaper alternative
than a second backup power plant.

If the main power plant sustains a critical hit of
Severity 3 or greater, the emergency power system
automatically activates and allows the ship to function

normally for five rounds with 90% of its normal Power. If
the power plant sustains a critical hit of Severity 6, the
emergency power is taken offline as well.

HIGH-EFFICIENCY BATTERIES
Ship-board batteries are designed to store power until
needed. They can be recharged in any round with
excess Power not being used by other systems. This
Power can then be used in subsequent rounds as if
they were being produced by the power plant; simply
add the amount of Power stored within the batteries (they need not be completely drained) to the Power the
ship has available that round.

High-efficiency batteries can be combined with
secondary power systems, such as solar energy
systems, to help keep them charged.

SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS


There are two types of solar energy systems used
by spacecraft: solar coatings and solar panels. Solar
coatings integrate photovoltaic cells into individual
hull panels, providing passive energy whenever a
spacecraft is within range of a star. Solar panels are
extendible energy-collection arrays that can provide
more power at a sacrifice of mobility and tonnage.

Neither technology generates enough energy to
provide for all the needs of most spacecraft but can be
used to provide backup power for critical systems or
paired with high-efficiency batteries (described on page
44) to provide a ready source of energy.

For solar coatings, Units indicate the percentage of the
hull covered, limited to a maximum of 40% of the hull.
Therefore, a 200-ton ship can have a maximum of 80
units. This limitation results from the fact that there are
joints, grooves and other hull structures that cannot be
coated. Solar coatings cannot be combined with most
other hull options, with radiation shielding being the
sole exception. Solar coatings consume no tonnage.
Spacecraft Options

Spacecraft Options

Solar coatings are typically only applied to standard
and sphere hull configurations, and only on ships that
are not expected to enter an atmosphere. Coatings
applied to close-structure and dispersed hulls produce
50% less energy because their surfaces have extensive
areas that are obscured from view, thus making it
difficult for them to extract power from a star. Coatings
are not applied to streamlined hulls since the stresses
of atmospheric re-entry renders them inoperable.
Repairs to coated hulls are expensive, costing twice the
amount listed in the Traveller Core Rulebook section on
Repairs on page 159.

For solar panels, Units indicate the tonnage required
for the system. For example, a 10-unit system
consumes 10 tons of space. Solar panels only provide
energy when they are deployed. Deployment requires
one space-combat turn (six minutes). The ship cannot
accelerate during deployment or when the panels are
extended without doing critical damage to the array.

Solar energy systems store a very limited amount of
energy. A system that is cut off from its source of solar
energy only provides power for one additional turn.

Ships with solar energy systems have certain limitations
because they must be near a star to work. Ships
operating within the habitable zone or closer to a star
receive the full listed power per installed Unit. For every
band of orbital distance that the ship travels into the
outer system of a star, they lose one half of their Power
output, rounding down. For example, in a star system
where the habitable zone is in the third orbital band
of the star, a solar energy system that generates 10
Power has its output cut to 5 in the fourth band, 2 in the
fifth band and so on. In addition, any time the system’s
collectors are blocked by an object – for example, a
planet, moon or planetoid – they stop collecting energy
and cease to provide power after one turn.

When deployed, solar panels nullify stealth and both
types of solar energy systems make spacecraft easier
to detect with sensors. Attempts to detect a ship with a

DRIVES


Drives can be modified or given accessories to extend
their utility or capability.

HIGH-BURN THRUSTER
A high-burn thruster is an auxiliary chemical rocket
designed to give a temporary speed boost to a ship.
This is done by adding a reaction drive whose Thrust is
cumulative with that of the ship’s regular drive system.
A reaction drive used as a high-burn thruster should
require far less fuel than a ship that uses reaction
drives as its main source of thrust because typical
applications are designed to provide thrust for a limited
amount of time. For example, high-burn thrusters might
be used to reach jump point faster, run a blockade or
elude pursuers.

Note that high-burn thrusters do not include inertial
compensation for a higher thrust rating than that of a
ship’s manoeuvre drive. Therefore, Travellers in a ship
that is accelerating with a high-burn thruster are subject
to the effects of its gravitational force equivalent, also
known as G-force.

CONCEALED MANOEUVRE DRIVE


Manoeuvre drives, whose function is described in
Ship Design on page 15, use thruster plates to move
a ship without the need for propellant. Manoeuvre
drive thruster plates are typically located on the outer
surface of a ship (facing aft is standard) where they
can perform best. While acceleration to their facing is
optimised, a ship may accelerate in other directions at
reduced thrust without turning the ship to a new facing.
For example, thruster plates can accelerate a ship at
up to 25% of their maximum thrust to port or starboard
and 10% to fore. Therefore, a ship with Thrust 4 could
exert one G of thrust to left or right and 0.4G to fore
without the need to turn the ship on its axis.



G-LOC
Accelerating at high g-force without the benefit of
gravitic compensation can adversely affect a ship’s
crew. As thrust is increased, high g-forces can
cause degraded performance, unconsciousness
and even death. Suffering unconsciousness from
exposure to high g-force is called g-induced loss
of consciousness (or g-LOC). This phenomenon
occurs at various g-forces, starting as low as three
or four g for many people.

Most Travellers can sustain forces of two or three
g for extended periods of time without losing
consciousness. However, training and equipment
is a big factor. Travellers who have the Pilot or
Flyer skill are trained to deal with high g-forces.
Equipment includes g-suits and drugs that
mitigate the effects, both of which may be found in
the Central Supply Catalogue.

Consult the g-LOC table for the effects of various
g-forces on Travellers, which includes performance
degradation and loss of consciousness. Travellers
must make END checks to avoid suffering the

negative effects of high-g, receiving DM+1 if
they remain seated in an acceleration seat or
similar assistive furniture for the duration of the
increment. Increments are per hour, per space
combat turn (six minutes) or per minute. For the
effects of g-LOC, refer to Unconsciousness on
page 83 of the Traveller Core Rulebook; however,
Travellers are allowed to make one check to
regain consciousness every D3 rounds instead of
once per minute.

Maintaining operation of a vehicle at seven or
more g without losing consciousness is extremely
difficult, although fit, trained and well-equipped
flyers have been known to sustain consciousness
for extended periods of time. Being exposed to
g-forces of 10+ without the benefits of training,
equipment and perhaps anti-g drugs is deadly
after a very short period of time. Exposure to
g-forces this high fall into the realm of Referee fiat.
If it serves the story and the Traveller is equipped
to deal with high g-forces, allow them to sustain
consciousness (or remain alive) for an appropriate
period of time.

Spacecraft Options

As such, thruster plates need not be exposed at all
and can optionally be concealed behind bulkheads.
This rather severely degrades performance but there
are some ship designs that are willing to accept the
trade-offs for added stealth. See the Sensors chapter
on page 55 for more information about features that
make a ship easier to detect, including the use of their
manoeuvre drives.

Concealed manoeuvre drives are contained within
ship bulkheads but must be within three metres of the
accelerating surface of the ship. Concealed manoeuvre
drives add 25% to the tonnage and cost of the drive.
The additional tonnage comprises a system that
contains and exhausts thruster plate ionisation out of
specially designed ports, reducing their detectability
to almost nil. Concealed manoeuvre drives cut
performance in half (round down), so a ship with Thrust

SOLAR SAIL


Solar sails are made of a flexible synthetic fabric that
has limited self-repair capabilities. Particles emitted
by the sun (the solar wind) are caught by the sail and
provide a minuscule amount of thrust. Solar sails have
the advantage that they require no power or reaction
mass but result in very slow ships and high technology
civilisations tend to regard them as useless for anything
other than automated cargo ships and pleasure yachts.
A deployed solar sail covers an area dozens of
kilometres across. A ship using a solar sail as its
primary method of propulsion has effective Thrust 0
and requires several days to change course or speed.

Jump drives cannot be engaged when a sail is deployed.

Option Tons Cost

FUEL


Even humble fuel tanks are ripe for modification
or addition, and a variety of systems have been
developed to enhance the endurance and range of
ships without the need to invest in much larger and
more expensive drives.

COLLAPSIBLE FUEL TANK


Collapsible fuel tanks (also called fuel bladders) are
large flexible bladders that expand when filled with
liquid-hydrogen fuel. They take up cargo space in a
ship and are used to extend range without the need to
fit mountable or drop tanks. Fuel cannot be pumped
directly from these tanks to the jump drive, so a ship
must complete a jump before it can use fuel stored in
collapsible tanks.

When empty, collapsible tanks consume 1% of the
tonnage they use when full.

DROP TANK


Sometimes seen on military assault ships, these are
external fuel tanks that are jettisoned just as the ship
enters jumpspace. The virtue of a drop tank is that it
allows a ship to carry a large amount of extra fuel but
jettisoning a tank so close to a jump carries a risk.
Jumping is a delicate procedure, greatly complicated
by having big empty fuel tanks drifting close to the
jump bubble.

Jump tanks come in two parts. Firstly, there are the
docking ports, fuel injectors and explosive collars that
allow the spacecraft to mount drop tanks and jettison
them quickly. Secondly, there are the drop tanks
themselves. A drop tank mount consumes a number of
tons on board the ship equal to 0.4% of the tonnage of
the drop tank itself (for the fittings needed to transfer
fuel). The mount costs MCr0.5 per ton and the drop
tank itself costs Cr25000 per ton of fuel space.

Spacecraft OptionsCollapsible fuel tank

Jumping using a drop tank applies a penalty of DM-15
minus the Tech Level of the drop tanks to the Engineer (J-drive) check required to make a jump (see page 157
of the Traveller Core Rulebook).

When a drop tank is used and jettisoned, roll 2D. On
8+, the tank survives the ejection process and can,
in theory, be retrieved and reused. Otherwise, it is
destroyed by the expanding jump bubble or warped
by the jettison explosion. In addition, drop tanks are
automatically destroyed once their ship has lost 10% of
its Hull points.

A ship’s Thrust must be recalculated when carrying
a drop tank, using the combined tonnage of the
ship and the drop tanks it carries. This likely means
the manoeuvre drive is operating at a lower Thrust.
The jump capability of the ship does not need
to be recalculated unless it jumps with the drop
tanks attached. A ship using drop tanks cannot be
streamlined – at best, it can be partially streamlined.

Option Cost
Drop Tank Mount MCr0.5 per ton

**FUEL/CARGO CONTAINER**
The downside of mountable and collapsible fuel tanks
is the time required to swap between fuel and cargo
carrying. In some configurations, tanks might block
access to some parts of the ship – certain vessels
use the cargo area as a thoroughfare, which can be a
problem if it is full of liquid hydrogen.

Dedicated fuel/cargo containers present an alternative,
allowing space to be switched between uses
without a lengthy remodelling of the ship’s interior.
Containers can also be built in such a manner as to
retain accessibility, including accessways, hatches
and heavy-duty partitions that make them part of the
ship rather than a component that must be added or
removed as necessary. Swapping from fuel tankage to
cargo space requires little more than flushing the tanks,
then loading them with cargo as needed.

Containers of this sort are sometimes used aboard
converted merchant craft to support other exploration
ships by acting as tankers or long-range supply ships.
They also increase the capabilities of an ordinary
merchant, permitting extended transits between mains
and clusters when necessary, yet retaining almost all
capacity for day-to-day freight-transportation operations.

Each ton of capacity in a fuel/cargo container requires
0.05 tons of additional equipment and costs Cr5000
per ton of capacity. For example, a fuel/cargo container
capable of carrying 100 tons consumes 105 tons and
costs Cr500000.

Option Cost
Fuel/Cargo Container Cr5000 per ton of capacity

FUEL PROCESSOR


Fuel processors convert unrefined fuel (typically
acquired via a fuel scoop) into refined fuel, making the
ship both self-reliant and safe.

Each ton of fuel processor can convert 20 tons of
unrefined fuel into refined fuel per day.

Option Cost Power
Fuel Processor Cr50000 per ton 1 per ton

FUEL SCOOP


Fuel scoops allow unstreamlined and partially
streamlined ships to gather unrefined fuel from a gas
giant (streamlined ships have fuel scoops built-in
automatically at no additional cost).

Adding scoops costs MCr1 and consumes no tonnage.

FUEL TANK COMPARTMENTS


These are containers designed to float within the
hydrogen fuel tanks of a ship and are harder than
concealed compartments to detect, as even a
thorough examination of the ship does not detect the
compartment unless the fuel tanks are opened and
searched. Such compartments can only be accessed
when the fuel tank is at least three-quarters empty.

A fuel tank compartment inflicts DM-4 to Electronics (sensors) checks and DM-6 to Investigate checks made
to search for it.

Fuel tank compartments cost Cr4000 per ton. Note that
the tonnage for these compartments is deducted from
the ship’s fuel tankage, not its total hull.

METAL HYDRIDE STORAGE


Instead of storing the ship’s hydrogen fuel in liquid
form at extremely low temperatures with a high risk
of explosion if a leak occurs into the inhabited spaces
of the ship, it is possible to store hydrogen at room
temperature using a non-flammable metal hydride
matrix. This takes up more space but is safer.

Spacecraft Options



Metal hydride storage replaces a ship’s normal fuel
tankage but consumes twice as much space and costs
MCr0.2 per ton.

If the ship sustains a fuel leak (fuel critical hit Severity
1–3, as shown on page 170 of the Traveller Core
Rulebook), fuel loss is reduced to 25% of the amount
indicated, to a minimum of one ton.

Option TL Cost
Metal Hydride Storage 9 MCr0.2 per ton of fuel

MOUNTABLE TANK


These tanks are used to convert cargo space into
working fuel tanks with all the pumps and feed lines
required. Fuel can be used directly from these tanks,
enabling ships to make longer jumps than they would
be able to on their own tanks (however, they are still
limited by the capability of their jump drive). When
empty, these tanks consume the same space as when
they are full and cannot be used for anything but fuel.

It takes four weeks to add or remove mountable fuel
tanks to a ship’s cargo spaces.

Option Cost
Mountable Tank Cr1000 per ton

RAMSCOOPS


Ramscoops are passive hydrogen collectors that
operate automatically whenever a starship is
manoeuvring in normal (non-jump) space. Ramscoops
require several weeks of continuous operation to obtain
enough hydrogen to fill the tanks of a typical ship. The
ship must be actively manoeuvring during this time,
enabling the ramscoops to extract hydrogen from the
interstellar medium. Ramscoop ships do not need fuel
scoops, nor do they need fuel processors since the
hydrogen is processed and purified as it is collected.
The advantage of this technology is that it enables a
starship to make as many jumps as desired without
ever visiting a starport or gas giant for refuelling.

The typical configuration for ramscoops is an array of
cylinders or similar structures outfitted on the exterior
of a ship, co-located with its fuel tanks. Because of
the bulkiness of the collectors, ships outfitted with
ramscoops cannot perform atmospheric re-entry
without damaging the ramscoops and are therefore
rarely streamlined. If the ship is docked or otherwise
immobile, ramscoops cease to function but will
automatically resume operation once the ship starts
manoeuvring again.

Ramscoops require 1% of a ship’s available tonnage
plus five tons, with a minimum overall size of 10 tons
and can collect five tons of hydrogen per week for
every ton attributed to the ramscoops. Additional
tonnage may be added as desired. Ramscoops cost
MCr0.25 per ton.

ACCOMMODATIONS


Most ships utilise the humble stateroom but other types
of accommodation are available. All accommodations
listed in this book other than low berths and
acceleration benches and seats include a fresher
while all staterooms and barracks include a small food
preparation area. Laundry facilities are usually located
in a common area.

ACCELERATION BENCH AND SEAT


These comprise basic seating used for the temporary
transportation of passengers. Comfort is limited but
safety remains paramount. The benches are heavily
padded with integral safety harnesses in case of gravity
failure. They are normally designed to fold down from
walls or pull up from floors, to grant more usable space
when not in use.

Similar to an acceleration bench, this seating is
somewhat comfier although less space efficient. While
not luxurious, it is commonly used on commercial small
craft designed for short haul flights to and from orbit
and flights to close satellites.

These are similar to the staterooms detailed on page

almost always choose a ship that has a high stateroom
over one that does not. A high stateroom grants DM+1
when seeking high passengers (see page 238 of the

The Luxury Stateroom’ is state of the art accommodation
for the most discerning passenger. It is noticeably a

BRIDGE


The bridge is the nerve centre of the ship and vital to
on-board operations. Some bridge designs put the
captain and other command staff on a raised balcony
or walkway over the workstations, while others put the
captain in a command seat in the centre of the bridge.
Bridges on scout ships are notoriously cramped and
smelly – even more so in belter mining ships where
the bridge and living space is sometimes combined to
maximise cargo capacity – while some groups of free
traders pride themselves on the elegance and style of
their command stations.

DETACHABLE BRIDGE


This bridge design can be ejected from the ship in
an emergency to become a lifeboat for the command
crew. The bridge has two weeks of life support and
battery power, while emergency thrusters give it basic
manoeuvring capabilities, equivalent to Thrust 0. A
detachable bridge is even capable of soft-landing on a
planetary surface.

SENSOR STATION


While every bridge has equipment dedicated to
monitoring and controlling the ship’s sensors (even if
this is tied to the pilot’s display), some ships benefit
from having additional stations to handle an increased
number of sensor operators. Some scout and survey
ships feature additional sensor stations, while military
vessels might feature similar stations dedicated to
locating the enemy and electronic warfare.

During space combat, sensor operators are often
called upon to perform a number of tasks, including
detecting enemy ships, obtaining sensor locks and
performing electronic warfare. With only a single
sensor station, the ship can only perform one of these
tasks in a given round but each additional sensor
station can perform a different task. For example,
with two sensor stations, a ship can attempt to obtain
a lock and perform electronic warfare in the same
combat round.

Option Tons Cost
Sensor Station 1 MCr0.5

Note that sensor stations are options only on ships of
7,500 tons or less. Capital ships are assumed to have
multiple sensor stations in their much larger bridges.

CARGO


The majority of ships in the universe are designed
to haul cargo from one star system to another.
Predictably, a whole host of optional systems and
equipment have been designed to make this easier.

CARGO CRANE


Built into the ceiling of a cargo hold, this overhead
gantry crane is designed to shift cargo containers in
and out of the ship. The crane’s mechanism moves
about the bay on a sliding jig and can extend beyond
the cargo door on a gibbet to deposit freight directly
onto a dockside or vehicle. The crane is strong enough
to lift fully loaded containers of up to 65 tons and can
couple with most pallets and crates.

CARGO NET


A slower but safer method than a scoop for retrieving
cargo from space, the net consists of a mesh of tough
plastic and several remotely controlled tow drones. The
drones are launched from the ship, dragging the net
out behind them. The net is drawn around a volume of
space and then retracted.

The plastic is extremely elastic, allowing the volume
of the net to be potentially increased to a dozen
cubic kilometres. Note that a starship cannot jump
with its cargo net extended.

Option Tons Cost
Cargo Net 5 MCr1

CARGO SCOOP


A cargo scoop allows a ship to pick up cargo or other
objects floating in space. The scoop includes anti-gravity baffles to minimise the impact but using a scoop
with a high relative velocity is not recommended.

A Pilot check is required to scoop up an object; if failed,
the ship collides with the object, taking an amount of
damage equal to the negative Effect. Armour negates
this damage, so most accidents are embarrassing rather
than catastrophic and merely require a little repainting. A
scoop can sweep up one ton of material per round.

Option Tons Cost
Cargo Scoop 2 MCr0.5

EXTERNAL CARGO MOUNT


Instead of carrying cargo inside the hull, a ship can
be designed to mount cargo in an external rack or
framework. This allows a smaller hull to be used,
making the cost of transportation considerably cheaper.
Ships with streamlined or dispersed structure hull
configurations cannot use external cargo mounts. A
ship’s Thrust and jump capability must be recalculated
when using external cargo mounts, using the combined
tonnage of the ship and the external cargo it carries.
This likely means that the manoeuvre drive operates at
a lower Thrust and jump capability is reduced.

Cargo carried externally can only be accessed outside
the ship by vacc suit or vehicle. Landing a ship with
external cargo mounts is a dangerous procedure,

Spacecraft Options

so these ships can have difficulties trading at worlds
without a shuttle fleet or highport. Landing a ship
requires a Difficult (10+) Pilot check. Failure results
in a Critical Hit to the cargo contained in the mount,
with each point of negative Effect causing one level of
severity, as described in the Critical Hit Effect chart on
page 170 of the Traveller Core Rulebook. For example,
a failed check with two points of negative Effect results
in 1D x 10% of cargo destroyed.

External cargo can be jettisoned remotely. The mount
is equipped with explosive bolts, allowing specific
cargo to be released if necessary. A ship using external
cargo mounts becomes unstreamlined regardless of its
default configuration.

The cost of an external cargo mount is Cr1000 for
every ton of cargo.

**JUMP NET**
A jump net consists of special field cables attached to
the rear of a ship that extend the vessel’s jump field
to include additional cargo contained within the net.
While this can look exceedingly crude and makes
the ship unstreamlined while in use, a great deal of
engineering goes into making it work and it remains
both cheap and effective.

A cheaper version designed purely for interplanetary
use is available at TL8 but the ship cannot perform a
jump while this net is deployed.

A ship using a jump net must have its drive potentials
adjusted by adding the cargo carried to the ship’s total
hull mass. This will likely degrade the ship’s Thrust and
jump scores.

25 crewmen.

SUPPLIES, SPARES AND STORES
Military capital ships maintain stores, spares
and supplies necessary for the operation of the
ship, measured in Supply Units (SU). Capital
ships consume an amount of SU equal to their
tonnage divided by 100 every day. Most ships
contain enough supplies for 100 days. Each 100
SU contains one ton of supplies. For example, a
50,000-ton warship normally consumes 500 SU per
day or five tons. The ship should therefore have a
minimum of 500 tons of cargo space so that it can
potentially store 100 days’ worth of SUs.

While there is no direct requirement for ships
to maintain a specific number of SUs, allowing
supplies to run low has a deleterious effect on the
operation of the ship and can negatively affect
morale. Refer to the Naval Campaigns Handbook
from the Element Class Cruisers box set for more
information. When designing a military capital
ship, note the Maximum Stores tonnage in the
cargo section of the ship sheet. Ideally, the overall
cargo tonnage of the ship should be equal to or
greater than this amount.

DRONES


Drones are small robotic craft typically controlled
from the bridge or a dedicated station. They are used
as labour-saving devices and for tasks that might
otherwise endanger the crew.

Drones are typically human-sized and have gravitic
drives that allow them to operate in both space and
atmospheres. However, while they can land on a
planet, they do not have the power to travel from the
surface to orbit and must be recovered manually. The
Electronics (remote ops) skill is required for their use.

Each of the drones listed here are described in more
detail in the Robot Handbook but basic descriptions are
presented here.

MINING DRONES


Mining drones allow a ship to mine asteroids without
manoeuvring perilously close to them. Each set of five
mining drones allows the ship to process 5D tons of
asteroid per day (typically producing common ore, as
detailed on page 159 of the Traveller Core Rulebook).
The tonnage consumed includes ore handling
machinery, allowing the ship to take on ore and transfer
it to the cargo bay.

PROBE DRONES


Probe drones are for surveying planetary surfaces and
are commonly found on board scout ships. They can be
dropped from orbit in disposable entry shells but must
be recovered manually. Probe drones are also capable
of surveying orbiting satellites, derelicts and other
space debris, and can also be used as communications
relays. These drones can operate indefinitely using
10-year half-life orbital solar panels. A backup battery
system provides power for up to 48 hours should the
drone be blocked from access to solar energy.

The logical development of the probe drone, the
advanced probe drone is of a similar size and carries
more advanced sensors (TL12). These drones can
operate indefinitely using 25-year half-life orbital solar
panels. A backup battery system provides power for
up to 72 hours should the drone be blocked from
access to solar energy.

REPAIR DRONES


Carrying repair drones allows a ship to make repairs
during combat, allowing access to exterior components
without risking crew.

Repair drones allow a Traveller with the Electronics (remote ops) skill to make an additional Repair
System action (see page 159 of the Traveller Core
Rulebook) during space combat. The repair drones
are considered to have an Engineer skill level of 1 or
the level the Traveller has in Electronics (remote ops),
whichever is lower, in all specialities for the Repair
System action alone.

A ship must dedicate 1% of its tonnage for effective
repair drone coverage (minimum one ton), at a cost of
MCr0.2 per ton.

SENSORS


Many ships, especially larger and more expensive
vessels, feature upgraded or specialised sensor
suites. However, any sensor suite can be upgraded
with a range of options to improve the likelihood
and quality of acquired data and the range at which
objects can be detected.

COUNTERMEASURES SUITE


A countermeasures suite (TL13) is designed to jam
enemy transmissions. Note that meson transmissions
cannot be jammed. The countermeasures suite
grants DM+4 to all attempts at jamming and electronic
warfare, regardless of the usual DM the sensor suite it
is attached to.

Spacecraft Options

A military countermeasures suite (TL15) is the cutting
edge of countermeasures technology, incorporating
powerful transmitters and advanced electronic-warfare
programs to shut down enemy communications. The
military countermeasures suite grants DM+6 for all
jamming and electronic warfare attempts, regardless of
the usual DM of the sensor suite it is attached to.

**DEEP PENETRATION SCANNERS**
Using neural activity sensors (NAS) and densitometers
configured to check every centimetre of a ship’s
internal and external hull, deep penetration scanners
require a target to be within Adjacent range. They allow
the operator to see everything within a ship that can
be perceived visually such as layout, hidden spaces
and the make-up of anything carried aboard the ship,
including crew, cargo or personal effects. However,
they are also very slow when scanning large ships
unless the scanner suite is very large.

Each ton of deep penetration scanner allows for 20
tons of a target vessel to be scanned every hour (so,
for example, a 25-ton suite can scan a 500-ton ship in
an hour).

**DISTRIBUTED ARRAY**
By using multiple hull-mounted arrays in an integrated
computer-controlled arrangement, it is possible to
increase the effective antenna size and range of
a sensor suite. EM and active radar/lidar can then
detect objects at Distant range and passive radar/
lidar at Long range. All information gained at these
ranges is minimal (see page 160 of the Traveller Core
Rulebook). This modification can only be added to
Improved and Advanced sensor suites and only on
ships of more than 5,000 tons.

Distributed arrays are available at TL11. Triple the
tonnage, cost and power requirement of the sensor
suite to which they are attached.

EXTENDED ARRAY


This is a distributed array that is extended well beyond
the hull of the ship on retractable arms; there is no
limit to the size of ship it can be mounted upon.
However, use of an extended array greatly limits the
manoeuvrability of the ship and increases its own
sensor signature.

An extended array acts in the same way as a distributed
array. While in use, the ship cannot expend any Thrust
or jump and any attempts to detect it gain DM+2.

Extended arrays are available at TL11. They triple the
tonnage and cost of the sensor suite to which they are
attached and triple the Power requirement.

EXTENSION NET


The defence of space is reliant upon properly
identifying ships and unidentified objects. A sensor
extension net enhances the clarity of a sensor suite
beyond its default range by using small drones to relay
additional data to a central hub. Each drone is also a
sensor platform in its own right, which transmits data to
the control centre of the array via a network.

An extension net increases the range at which a sensor
suite can normally obtain Limited or Full detail by a
single step. For example, a visual sensor can normally
see Full detail up to Short range and Limited detail up
to Long range. With an extension net, this is increased
to full detail up to Medium range and Limited detail up
to Very Long range.

An extension net cannot be used with NAS or
densitometers, nor can it be used to receive data if the
ship that deployed it is manoeuvring.

LIFE SCANNER


The life scanner is a ship-mounted sensor array
specifically calibrated for detecting signs of life and
differentiating between life forms. For example, it
can differentiate between colonies of insects, herds
of migrating animals and social groups of sentient
creatures. Typically used in high orbit above a newly
discovered planet, within 24 hours (for an average,
earth-sized world) it can identify and quantify population
densities, likely life types (sapient, sentient, non-sapient
and so forth) and ecological niches.

Spacecraft Options



When using the life scanner, an Electronics (sensors)
check is required to successfully interpret the results.
The life scanner is not 100% accurate; it typically
has an accuracy of between 70% and 85% but this is
sufficient for first-pass exploration needs.

The life scanner analysis suite is a more advanced
version that does all of the things the lower tech model
does but also takes atmospheric and environmental
factors into account to develop an accurate portrait of
the biology of life detected. For example, the system
can indicate the physical configuration of detected
life, approximate its food requirements and analyse
additional critical data that informs the Travellers on
how to prepare for direct encounters with the life form.

MINERAL DETECTION SUITE


This suite upgrades sensor systems that include a
densitometer, enabling them to determine types of
minerals present and their quantities.

The mineral detection suite is available at TL12,
consumes one ton and costs MCr5.

RAPID-DEPLOYMENT EXTENDED ARRAYS
This system works in the same way as an extended
array but it can be deployed and retracted within a few
seconds, allowing a ship to use its manoeuvre and
jump drives within the same combat round.

Rapid-deployment extended arrays are available at
TL11. They triple the tonnage of the sensor array to
which they are attached, multiply its cost by five and
triple its Power requirement.

SHALLOW PENETRATION SUITE


This is a combined thermal/EM sensor suite
designed specifically for hull penetration and internal
scanning at range.

At up to Very Long range, it allows a sensor operator
to ensure there is nothing unusual aboard a vessel
that leaves a thermal or electromagnetic trace. For
example, it detects increased heat production where
there should be none or the operation of fire control
computers on an unarmed merchant.

cost of increased vulnerability to jamming, with other
ships doubling all DMs they have for jamming a ship
equipped with signal processing.

**BREACHING TUBE**
All airlocks include flexible plastic docking tubes that
allow passengers to cross from one ship to another
by floating through the air-filled tube. A breaching tube
is a military version of the airlock that may be forcibly
applied to the hull of another ship. Instead of a thin
myomer, the breaching tube is made of a combination
of ballistic cloth and reflec. The breaching tube does
not end in a docking collar but in a magnetic clamp with
a ring of plasma torches that burn through the hull of an
enemy vessel when attached.

Breaching tubes can only be attached to disabled
or otherwise inert ships. If either ship moves after
a breaching tube has been attached, the breaching
tube is destroyed and the ship to which it is attached
receives 2D damage. In addition, if the breaching tube
plasma torches have been allowed to begin cutting
through the hull, the ship to which they are attached
might suffer an explosive decompression event. Refer
to Atmosphere and Vacuum in the Traveller Companion
for more information.

An attacking ship fitted with a breaching tube gains
DM+1 to rolls made on the Boarding Actions table on
page 175 of the Traveller Core Rulebook. For more
advanced rules, see Boarding Actions on page 125 of
this book.

Option Tons Cost
Breaching Tube 3 MCr3

**DOCKING CLAMP**
A docking clamp allows a spacecraft to carry another
vessel on the exterior of its hull, typically a small craft
such as a ship’s boat or fighter. This permits a ship
to carry auxiliary craft without consuming valuable
interior space.

A ship’s Thrust and jump capability must be
recalculated when another ship occupies its docking
clamp, using the combined tonnage of both ships. This
likely means the manoeuvre drive will be operating at a
lower Thrust and the jump capability is reduced.

The size of a docking clamp dictates the tonnage of the
ship it may attach as shown in the Docking Clamp table.
Docking clamps can be added to streamlined ships but
the ship becomes unstreamlined when another ship
is docked to it. Docking clamps alone do not affect a
streamlined configuration. It takes three full rounds to
release or clamp a ship of less than 2,000 tons, during
which time neither ship can expand any Thrust or make
any attack rolls. Larger ships take D3+3 rounds.

Note that ships held in a docking clamp can be targeted
separately by an attacker. Any evasive action employed
by the mothership can be applied as normal.

FORCED LINKAGE APPARATUS


Used by naval patrol ships, scavengers and pirates
to board spacecraft, forced linkage apparatuses are
close-range grappling devices that allow attempts at
forced docking. After a successful grapple, the ship
can be boarded or towed into port at leisure. Grappling
cables can be used to restrain a fleeing ship or stabilise
a tumbling ship. The ship attempting forced linkage
must have a Thrust advantage of at least one over
the opposing ship and may not be less than half the
tonnage of the target ship.

The use of Forced Linkage requires a task chain. First
the attacking ship’s pilot must position their ship for
the linkage attempt. If the target ship is crewed and
powered, make an opposed Pilot check (DEX or INT)
against the pilot of the target ship. Each unused point
of Thrust may be applied for DM+1. After the pilot of the
attacking ship has won an opposed check, a gunner fires
the grappling device: Average (8+) Gunner (turret) check (DEX), adding the Task Chain DM.

At TL7 the apparatus is little more than a magnetic
clamp on a retractable arm. At TL9 the linkages are
gas-powered grapnels with a reeling cuff, while at TL12
the linkage is magnetically propelled and guided by
targeting lasers. At TL15 the linkage is made of gravitic
field control rods and antennae.

A forced linkage apparatus may be combined with a
breaching tube. Note that forced linkage devices may
only be used on ships of 5,000 tons or less.

GRAPPLING ARM


A grappling arm is a remotely controlled device used
to pick up or manipulate objects in space. The arm is a
flexible tentacle of thousands of telescoping segments,
capable of reaching out to 250 metres. The arm ends
in a set of cameras and grippers of varying sizes, from
large claws to tiny micro-manipulators. It also carries a
toolkit that can be customised for a particular task.

A grappling arm can manipulate objects of up to two
tons. A heavy grappling arm can manipulate objects of
up to 10 tons. Multiple grappling arms of either type can
be used to move heavier objects.

HOLOGRAPHIC HULL


Multiple holographic projectors are embedded within
the hull allowing the ship to change hull colours, add
graphics and adopt a different appearance (although
its shape remains the same). Changing the hull colour
or adding a stored graphic can be done by anyone
with access to the ship’s computer. Creating a complex
colour scheme from scratch requires the talents of
a skilled artist. Some young nobles try to outdo one
another by changing the schemes daily or hiring artists
to create the most complex scenes imaginable. Some

pirates have made use of this system to simulate visual
hull damage and lure other ships in with a Signal GK
distress call. However, most ship owners use it for
advertising. The projectors are small enough that they

of both ships; therefore, the manoeuvre drive will be
operating at a lower Thrust. A ship towing an object in
this fashion cannot jump.

INTERNAL SYSTEMS


A wide variety of options and internal systems are

may be added to a ship.

Airlocks consume a minimum of two tons and cost MCr0.1

ARMOURY


Ships carrying a large number of marines or soldiers
can benefit from an armoury, a specialised weapons
storage facility. An armoury can only be accessed by
those with the correct codes (usually the ship’s senior
officers and security teams) and may contain a wide
variety of weapons. An armoury can be equipped
with specialised weaponry but, as standard, will have
enough snub pistols for the entire crew, enough
accelerator or gauss rifles for any marines and a
selection of other military equipment such as grenades,
combat drugs, armour and communications equipment.

COMMON AREAS


A standard ship’s common area is used for dining
and recreation. Most are pedestrian affairs with
some chairs and tables, a refrigeration device,
food dispensaries, a fresher, laundry facilities
and possibly a holovision or other entertainment
device. However, extravagant ship owners
sometimes install more exotic entertainments. The
following are but a few possible additions to the
common area.

Advanced Entertainment System
Available as low as TL5, early systems focus on
audio facilities but as Tech Levels advance, such
systems rapidly advance to include visual mediums
such as holovisions and virtual-reality gaming
spaces. No tonnage is required. Cr100–10000,
depending on Tech Level and sophistication.

Brewery or Distillery
One or more weeks in jumpspace can seem a
long time, providing a great opportunity to learn
how to make beer or liquor. Producing fine beer
and other alcoholic beverages typically requires a
factory-sized facility but at high Tech Levels, the
entire process can take place in a fraction of the
space. Most brewmasters and distillers use tried
and true ingredients but if there is one thing that
most species have discovered, it is that just about
any photosynthetic plant ferments. Bold Travellers
might want to create new and exciting drinks for
their crewmates to enjoy. Microbreweries and
distilleries appear at TL10 and require 0.5 tons to
produce 10 litres of beer or liquor per week. Each
ton of equipment costs MCr0.1.

Gourmet Kitchen
All ships’ commons contain a galley at the very
least but discerning captains add facilities for
a finer culinary experience. These may include
specialised ovens, refrigeration devices, food-preparation equipment and other items that enable
a qualified steward to tantalise the palates of the
crew and passengers. A minimum of Steward 2
is required to properly use such facilities, which
consume one ton per diner and cost MCr0.2 per
ton. Ships with a gourmet kitchen gain DM+1
when seeking high passengers.

COMMON AREAS (CONTINUED)
Hot Tub
After a long day exploring alien worlds and fighting
interstellar wars, there are few things more
relaxing for the average Traveller than soaking
in warm water with friends. A hot tub requires
0.25 tons for each Traveller intended to use it
simultaneously and costs Cr12000 per ton.

Swimming Pool
There are two types of pool that can be installed
in the common area: standard and endless.
Standard pools are the typical sort found in
a gymnasium, with room to swim for multiple
Travellers. Endless pools are used for exercise
and rehabilitation and can be quite small. Endless
pools move their water using a propeller or – at
higher Tech Levels, gravitics – in circular fashion
to provide an artificial current for a Traveller
to swim against. Standard pools consume a
minimum of four tons and cost Cr20000 per
ton. Endless pools consume two tons and cost
Cr50000. Both come with sealing covers.

Theatre
To jump or not to jump, that is the question.
Reasonably sized common areas can host live
drama which, even in the year 1105, has its
dedicated fans. Most ships that contain a theatre
convert one or more staterooms into dressing
rooms for the actors. The most basic theatre is
little more than a stage and curtain but as Tech
Levels increase, holographic effects, immersive
sound systems and other enhancements can add
to the experience. A basic theatre is a minimum
of eight tons and costs MCr0.1 per ton. A more
advanced theatre with programmable lights and
sound costs MCr0.2 per ton. Advanced Theatres
often incorporate holographic projectors to
produce scenery and other elements to more fully
immerse the audience in the narrative. Theatres
become more expensive if additional features and
technology are added. More lavish productions
require a minimum of 12 tons with some shipboard
theatres exceeding 20 tons.

Wet Bar
This is a basic wet bar, usually species-specific
and tailored to the tastes of the ship’s owner.
Includes beer taps, wine refrigerators, liquor racks
and similar items in the space where the common
kitchen is located. No tonnage required. Wet bars
cost Cr2000, not including the beverages.

Zero-G Room
A current trend in starship design is the inclusion
of a zero-G room, which is essentially just an
enclosed closet with the artificial gravity turned
off. While there are no definitive studies that
verify this, many spacers believe that time spent
in zero-G is therapeutic, a welcome respite from
simulated gravity where one can philosophise
and ponder the mysteries of the universe. Zero-G
rooms may be of any size. Controls and a safe-access portal (the transition from artificial gravity
to zero-G can be disorienting and injurious
without such a device) cost Cr50000. An engineer
can actually turn any portion of a ship into an
impromptu zero-G room at will, but without the
requisite safety mechanisms, those without
Athletics (dexterity) or Vacc Suit skills have a risk

**CONCEALED COMPARTMENT**
A smuggler’s favourite, concealed compartments are
cunningly hidden from visual searches and shielded
against sensors, allowing them to be used to transport
contraband or other questionable items.

Up to 5% of a ship’s tonnage can be designated as
a concealed compartment which inflicts DM-2 to
Electronics (sensors) checks and DM-4 to Investigate
checks made to search for it.

Concealed compartments cost Cr20000 per ton.

**CONSTRUCTION DECK**
Primarily used on very large civilian vessels, this
facility is effectively a mobile shipyard that can repair
and build smaller ships. A construction yard can
build a ship of tonnage equal to half the tonnage of
the construction deck at a TL equal to the ship the
construction deck is on.

Construction decks cost MCr0.5 and require 1 Power
per ton.

**DOCKING SPACE**
This is an internal bay in which a smaller auxiliary
ship or vehicle can dock. When sealed, the docking
space completely covers the auxiliary ship. It takes 1D
minutes for the auxiliary ship to enter or leave the larger
ship. Docking space consumes an amount of tonnage
equal to that of the largest ship to be docked, plus 10%
(round up to the nearest ton). Use shipping size for
vehicles, as detailed in the Traveller Core Rulebook
and the Vehicle Handbook.

It takes D3 rounds to release or recover a ship of less
than 2,000 tons, during which time neither ship can
expend Thrust or make attack rolls. Larger ships take
1D rounds.

Option Cost
Docking Space MCr0.25 per ton

**FULL HANGAR**
Normally, when a smaller ship or vehicle is included
in the design of a larger one, it is installed in a
docking space, with barely enough room for crew and
passengers to scramble aboard. Most repairs and
maintenance require the craft to be launched first.

Alternatively, a full hangar allows for repairs and
maintenance of the craft when it is on board its mother
ship. The hangar includes specialised testing and repair

equipment. Spare parts must be acquired separately. It
normally takes 2D minutes for the auxiliary ship to enter
or leave the larger ship.

A full hangar consumes an amount of tonnage equal
to twice that of the craft it contains (round up to the
nearest ton). Use Shipping Size for vehicles, as
detailed in the Traveller Core Rulebook.

Option Cost
Full Hangar MCr0.2 per ton

GRAV SCREEN


A gravity screen blocks densitometers from scanning
the inside of a ship, rendering them useless and
returning error codes. They are impenetrable to this
mode of scanning but the presence of gravity screens
is obvious to a sensor operator.

HARDENED SYSTEM


Any system that draws power from the power plant can
be Hardened to render it immune to Ion weapons. A
Hardened system has its cost increased by +50%.

LABORATORY


Space allocated to laboratories can be used for
research and experimentation, effectively turning the
ship into a space-going science vessel.

Every four tons dedicated to laboratories space allows
one scientist to perform research on board the ship.
The cost for research equipment varies depending
on the nature of research undertaken but is generally
about MCr1 for every four tons. Refer to the Traveller
Core Rulebook for scientific toolkits available.

LAUNCH TUBE


Launching and recovering smaller craft from a larger
ship is usually a time-consuming activity when using
docking spaces or full hangars. Launch tubes allow
craft to be launched rapidly, using electromagnetic
technology similar to that used by railguns. Multiple
launch tubes are often installed on capital ships that
carry small craft, allowing them to launch potentially
entire squadrons very quickly.

It takes one round to manoeuvre a craft into ‘firing’
position within a launch tube but, once there, it takes
a single space combat round to release up to 10

craft, after which both the mothership and launched
spacecraft may expend Thrust and make attack rolls
during the same round.

A launch tube consumes an amount of tonnage equal
to 10 times the size of the largest craft it must launch.
In addition, each craft carried on the ship that use the
launch tube must have a docking space or full hangar (using the costs and tonnage on page 61).

Option TL Cost Power
Launch Tube 9 MCr0.5 per ton 1 per ton

LIBRARY


A library contains computer files as well as lecterns,
display screens, holotanks and perhaps even hard
copies of books. A good library is useful for both
research and passing time in jump space.

Having a library on board a ship grants DM+1 on
any EDU check made when training for new skills in
jumpspace or other periods of extended inactivity.

Option TL Tons Cost
Library 8 4 MCr4

MEDICAL BAY


The presence of a medical bay on a ship can mean the
difference between life and death for the crew, so long
as there are sufficiently trained personnel on board.

A medical bay grants DM+1 to all Medic checks made
within it.

Each four tons attributed to medical bays supports
the treatment of up to three patients so long as there
is at least one medic or autodoc (see Central Supply
Catalogue, page 81) present.

Multiple medical bays can be combined into one larger
facility that serves more patients.

Option Tons Cost Power

RE-ENTRY CAPSULE
These capsules enable the occupants of a spacecraft
to quickly depart for the surface of any planet the
ship is orbiting. They feature heavy heat-shielding
and can provide a rocky, although relatively safe,
passage through the atmosphere. Each capsule holds
one person and is generally used as an emergency
escape vehicle to save lives when a ship is in danger
of being destroyed.

At TL10, assault capsules become available, used
to deploy infantry directly onto a planetary surface,
throwing out countermeasures as they go. They grant
the occupant Protection +20 and inflict DM-2 on any
Electronics (sensors) checks made to detect them.

At TL14, high-survivability capsules are available, an
improvement on the assault capsule. They are heavily
armoured and deploy multiple decoys as they plunge
through the atmosphere. They grant the occupant
Protection +30, inflict DM-4 on any Electronics (sensors) checks made to detect them, and DM-2
against any attack rolls.

RE-ENTRY POD
A re-entry pod is similar to a capsule but is built with
a gliding surface and computer guidance, allowing it
to avoid potentially dangerous terrain and deliver up
to two occupants safely to a planet’s surface. A skilled
Traveller can take control of the pod’s descent using
the Flyer (wing) skill.

The counterpart of launch tubes, a recovery deck
allows the rapid recovery of ships. This is used on a

safety equipment that arrests the motion of any craft
that enters it too quickly. A recovery deck may be
used to store small craft on board a ship but it cannot
function as a full hangar since it is open to vacuum.

A recovery deck recovers one craft every round.

A recovery deck consumes an amount of tonnage equal
to 10 times the size of the largest craft it must recover.
Multiple recovery decks can be combined into larger
recovery decks, each capable of recovering more than
one craft at a time.

**STABLE**
Used by traders, stables are low-grade housing for
animals and, in some systems, slaves. Stables come
with their own air scrubbers and waste-collectors,
avoiding the need to tax the existing life support
systems of the ship.

A 10-ton stable is capable of housing 20 human-sized
or 10 cattle-sized creatures.

**TRAINING FACILITIES**
Mercenary companies based in ships have a particular
problem not suffered by ground-based organisations.
While training office workers and support units is
easily done around the ship, given enough free space,
combat training is much harder. For this reason, many
mercenary space vessels incorporate training facilities
into their design with thick bulkhead walls to stop

rounds from penetrating and multiple gyms, prep rooms
and firing ranges. This allows for new recruits to be
trained and old hands to keep their skills up.

Option Tons Cost

UNREP SYSTEM


This is a system designed to allow for replenishment and
resupply of warships while in motion and is vital to the
function of squadrons in unexplored or hostile systems.
The system includes fuel hoses, cargo transfer tubes
and other gear designed to move ordnance and freight
between two ships (although only one of the ships is
required to carry the UNREP system).

Each ton dedicated to the UNREP system allows the
transfer of 20 tons of fuel, cargo or ordnance every hour.

VAULT


A vault is a secure armoured chamber placed within the
heart of a ship designed to survive attacks that might
annihilate the rest of a vessel.

A vault usually survives the destruction of its ship and is
sealed so any occupants contained within can survive
in a vacuum for a limited period of time. The vault can
contain cargo, staterooms or any other internal ship
components. Vaults vary between 4–40 tons.

Often larger than the mightiest capital ships, space
stations are a vital component of any interplanetary
society’s military, economic and social structure,
providing living space, manufacturing facilities and a
stepping stone into deep space. Some space stations
are dedicated to military operations and may be
better described as battle stations, while others are
specialised for industrial production, ship-building or
habitation. Given the resources needed to build the
largest space stations, however, most can handle a
multitude of functions, acting as a trading post or space
port with industrial facilities but serving the needs of
warships when necessary.

This chapter describes everything you will need to
construct space stations and then operate them within
a living universe.

CONSTRUCTION


Space stations are designed and built in the same
fashion as ships, with a few differences. Unless stated
otherwise in this chapter, all rules that apply to ships
also apply to space stations – in effect they are treated
as large and (mostly) immobile spacecraft.

STEP 1: CREATE A HULL
1,000 tons – research facility or orbital defence station
100,000 tons – modest space station
1 billion tons – orbital highport of a populous world

Any configuration except streamlined (space stations do
not enter atmospheres!). See page 10 of the ship design
sequence. Most space stations use a dispersed structure.

Space stations with non-gravity hulls can be of
unlimited size.

STEP 2: INSTALL DRIVES
Manoeuvre drive with Thrust 0 consumes tonnage
equal to 0.25% of the space station’s total hull and
costs MCr1 per ton. Enables the station to make flight
corrections to stay in orbit.

Stations without a manoeuvre drive must be adjusted
manually by a tug or other suitable spacecraft.

STEP 3: INSTALL POWER PLANT
Two main power requirements:

BASIC SYSTEMS


Artificial gravity, heating, lighting and life support.
Required Power = 20% of hull tonnage.

MANOEUVRE DRIVE


Required power = 10% of hull tonnage. See Install
Power Plant on page 17.

STEP 4: INSTALL FUEL TANKS
Chemical power plants require 10 tons of fuel per ton of
power plant for every two weeks of operation.

Other power plants require fuel tankage equal to 10%
of their size (round up, minimum one ton). This provides
enough fuel for the power plant for four weeks. Multiply
this figure for extended performance. For example,
double its size for eight weeks, triple it for 12 and so on.

STEP 5: INSTALL CONTROL CENTRE
The control centre is the ‘bridge’ of a space station. The
cost is MCr0.1 per 100 tons (or part of) of the station it
is installed within.

Size of Space Station Size of Control Centre
500–tons or less 10 tons
501–5,000 tons 20 tons
5,001–20,000 tons 40 tons
20,001–100,000 tons 60 tons
100,001–2,500,000 tons 80 tons
2,500,001 tons+ 100 tons

COMMAND AND CONTROL CENTRE


This is installed in military space stations and functions
like a command bridge on a starship, enabling the
station to command fleets across an entire star system.
Command and control centres are double the cost of a
command centre of the same size and grant DM+1 to
all Tactics (naval) checks made by its staff.

# S PACE STATIONS

STEP 6: INSTALL COMPUTER
See page 20 of the ship design sequence.

STEP 7: INSTALL SENSORS
See page 21 of the ship design sequence. Large space
stations should have redundant sensor arrays.

STEP 8: INSTALL WEAPONS
Space stations may install all available weapons.
However, due to their lack of manoeuvrability, few
install spinal mount weapons.

See Weapons and Screens on page 26.

STEP 9: INSTALL

OPTIONAL SYSTEMS


Select from all available spacecraft options and the
options listed in Space Station Options on page 66.

STEP 10: DETERMINE CREW
Use the Crew Requirements table to determine how
many personnel are required. Salaries shown are
the monthly average for skill level 1 crew; add +50%
for every skill level above 1. For large space stations (more than 5,000 tons) note the Large Ships modifiers
on page 22 to obtain final totals.

STEP 11: INSTALL ACCOMMODATIONS
Install standard, high and luxury staterooms for crew
and official visitors, optionally allowing for double
occupancy for non-command roles.

Low berths are rare except on military stations where
they are used for frozen watch.

See Residential Zones on page 66 for resident
accommodations and an alternative approach to
crew residences.

COMMON AREAS AND LIVING SPACE


Apply half the tonnage used for all accommodations and
residential zones. Includes recreation areas, mess halls
and restaurants, parks, pools, theatres and so on, for
station residents. Common areas cost MCr0.1 per ton.

AIRLOCKS AND CARGO HATCHES


One airlock per 500 tons of space station. Install
additional airlocks and cargo hatches as described on
page 25 of the ship design sequence.

STEP 12: ALLOCATE CARGO SPACE
Remaining space may be designated as cargo holds.
For military space stations, note the Supplies, Spares
and Stores rules on page 52.

STEP 13: FINALISE DESIGN
Calculate annual maintenance by taking the total cost
of the station and divide this figure by 12,000 for the
monthly cost.

Calculate total life support and reduce by 25–50% to
account for typical occupied usage of accommodations
and residential facilities.

SPACE STATIONS IN BATTLE


In combat, space stations are treated as if they were
ships, with the following exceptions:
•	 Space stations cannot manoeuvre to any
appreciable degree in combat and thus follow
very predictable orbital paths. All attack rolls made
against space stations gain DM+4.
•	 So long as the position of the space station is
known, missiles and torpedoes can be used
against space stations at any range, effectively
coasting to their target in the final stages of attack.
However, if the missile or torpedo is making an
attack after it has expended its fuel, any point
defence gains DM+2 against it.

•	 Space stations may never engage in any kind
of combat manoeuvring (see the Traveller Core
Rulebook, page 164).

SPACE STATION OPTIONS


In addition to residential zones, listed above, the
following options greatly expand their utility.

COMMERCIAL ZONE


Shops, offices, trading halls, restaurants and trinket
stalls, are all required to attract regular customers to a
space station. At the low end, commercial zones can
simply be partitioned areas that are adapted by tenants
but advanced space stations are likely to offer extensive
business and commercial facilities, such as trading
networks, conference centres and attractive plazas.

Commercial zones cost MCr0.2 per ton and require 1
Power for every 200 tons.

DEEP-SPACE COMMUNICATIONS RELAY
The longest delay in the x-boat network, other than
the necessary week-long jump, is the time it takes for
the real-space transfer from the 100-diameter limit to
a central hub station. In some cases, a space station
can work around this by using a high-capacity network

Space Stations

RESIDENTIAL ZONES


On advanced worlds, population often outstrips
demand for space and huge orbital colonies are
created. In other systems, people live on space
stations because of dangerous environments
planetside or simply because of personal
preference. The number of people who can be
housed within residential spaces depends on the
resources and space allocated to it, as shown on the
Residential Zones table. This table lists approximate
SOC suited to the housing and facilities, as well as

the tonnage consumed per person housed, the cost
per ton and Power required for every 100 tons or
part of consumed by the residential zone.

Residential zones are essentially interchangeable
with stateroom accommodations. Stations that use
both typically install stateroom facilities strictly for
crew and official visitors while residential zones
are considered urban environments in which non-station-personnel live. Egalitarian or economical
space stations sometimes house their crew with the
rest of the station population in the residential zones
instead of sequestering them in their own area.

that transmits huge reams of data directly to x-boats
and the mail pods they carry. If an x-boat is carrying
cargo and physical mail, it must visit a space station
equipped with a deep space communications relay
and warehouse or cargo transfer facility. If there are
no physical goods to deliver, x-boats can exchange
information from anywhere in the system in relatively
short order (only accounting for time lag on the data
transfer, which occurs at the speed of light). In this
case, the x-boat can refuel – possibly simultaneously
with the data transfer operation – and move on
immediately thereafter.

A deep-space communications relay becomes available
at TL10. It consumes 500 tons and costs MCr50. At
TL12, the relay has undergone enough refinement
to only consume 250 tons and costs MCr100. An
advanced version is available from TL13 that only
consumes 150 tons and costs MCr150.

**DOCKING FACILITY**
Unless they are extremely specialised, space stations
must have a way of connecting with ships in order
to survive and prosper, be they traders looking to
exchange goods, warships coming for refits or supply
ships bringing vital materials and replacement crew.

All space stations are capable of externally docking
with a number of ships whose total tonnage does not
exceed twice their own tonnage. Alternatively, a single
ship of any size can dock with a space station. This is
achieved through the use of docking arms and clamps,
which are assumed to be purchased and installed
during the construction of the space station’s hull.

The largest space stations are capable of receiving
ships within internal bays. This provides ships with
protection and makes repairs and the transfer of goods
and passengers much easier.

This kind of docking facility consumes three tons for
every ton of the largest ship it is capable of handling or
the total tonnage of ships it can handle at any one time (so, a 6,000-ton docking facility can hold ships totalling
up to 2,000 tons).

For every ton they consume, docking facilities cost
MCr0.25. They also need one crewman for every 100 tons.

FUEL REFINERY


The production of refined fuel in space has three
distinct steps from start to finish; gather unrefined fuel,
refine it, then store and distribute it. A space station
with a fuel refinery must be in orbit of either a gas giant
or a world with water present in order to function.

The gathering of unrefined materials is performed by
streamlined scoop drones – flying wings with bulbous
fuel bays. They fly through the atmospheres of gas
giants or scoop up water from oceans. In asteroid
belt systems, they extract water from planetoids. After
obtaining raw gases or water, they return to the space
station to refine it for hydrogen.

A fuel refinery is a collection of high-end processing
machinery that turns water and gases into starship
fuel. The Fuel Refinery table shows how much fuel
each refinery is capable of producing per day per ton
dedicated to it, along with its Power requirement. The
table also shows how many crew are needed to service
the refinery. Space dedicated to refineries includes
hangars and other facilities required for scoop drones
to bring the raw materials back to the space station.

Fuel Tanks: Normal cargo space cannot be used to
store processed fuel. Instead, large fuel tanks must be
built at a cost of Cr50000 per ton.

MANUFACTURING PLANT


Orbital manufacturing facilities enable the production
of vast amounts of goods. The types of goods created
are dependent on the type of manufacturing plant,
including the following: Basic, Advanced, Specialist
and Agricultural, as shown on the Manufacturing
Plant table. This table also shows the cost and
Power requirement per ton and how many tons of
manufacturing plant are needed to produce one ton of
goods per day.

The rate of production can be improved if goods
are manufactured in a system that can provide the
needed raw materials quickly and easily. If the system

SHIPS AND STATIONS


With the Referee’s approval, space station
modules can be installed on other spacecraft as
well. There is no reason why a large enough ship
could not, for example, have a deck dedicated to
mining and refining ore from asteroids.

Fundamentally, a space station is a ship that
lacks mobility. Aside from that, there are no real
differences between a space station and a ship.



the space station is within meets the Trade Code
requirement in the Goods table, then production is
increased by 25%.

MINERAL REFINERY


Mineral refineries convert asteroids into useful metals
and materials. Some are made up of individual
platforms, each of which contribute to the operation and
others are distributed systems with multiple substations

coordinated by a central hub. This is an alternative
to mining asteroids and transporting only the ore, as
practiced by ships such as the seeker on page 162.

Mineral refineries rely on manned tugs to bring suitable
asteroids to the space station, although at TL12 these
are replaced by tug drones.

Once asteroids are delivered to the station, they must
be crushed, the ores and other by-products sorted, and
waste released back into space. The produce is split

between 50% Common Ore, 30% Uncommon Ore, 15%
Crystals and Gems and 5% Precious Metals (as defined
on page 244 of the Traveller Core Rulebook). For
example, for every 100 tons of produce from the refinery,
50 tons is Basic Ore, 30 tons is Uncommon Ore, 15 tons
Crystals & Gems and five tons Precious Metals.

Technology rapidly enhances the capabilities of a
mineral refinery. The Mineral Refinery table shows how
much produce each refinery is capable of producing
per day, per ton dedicated to it, along with its Power
requirement. The table also shows how many crew
are needed to service the refinery. Space dedicated to
refineries includes hangars and other facilities required
for tugs to bring asteroids back to the space station.

Cargo space is normally dedicated to storing the
produce from a refinery.

**Smelter:** Ores are the normal end-product of a
mineral refinery but many stations also conduct on-board processing to create more valuable materials.
A smelter allows Common Ores to be processed into
Common Raw Materials and Uncommon Ores into
Uncommon Raw Materials. Each ton of smelter allows
the processing of 0.2 tons of Ores into 0.1 tons of Raw
Materials per day. A smelter costs MCr0.5 and requires
1 Power per ton.

SHIPYARD


The smallest shipyards are found on civilian stations for
the construction of small craft but far larger construction
sites can be found on the stations of megacorporations
and militaries. Shipyards provide the facilities needed
to build ships to the Tech Level of the space station.

A shipyard consumes two tons for every ton of the
largest ship it is capable of building or the total
tonnage of ships it can build at any one time (so, a
10,000-ton shipyard can build ships totalling up to
5,000 tons). For every ton they consume, shipyards
cost MCr0.5 and require 1 Power. They also need one
crewman for every 10 tons.

In order to construct ships with jump drives, a shipyard
must be of a suitable Tech Level, as defined on the
Jump Potential table on page 16. So, for example, to
build jump-3 ships, a shipyard must be at least Tech
Level 12. Shipyards capable of building ships with jump
drives have their cost increased to MCr0.75 per ton.

STARPORTS


It is possible for a space station to be classed as a
starport for a system. This can be either as a highport
servicing ships that cannot reasonably reach planetside
facilities or as the sole starport within a system. The
class of starport a space station can be rated as
depends on the facilities it can offer, as shown on the
Starports table. All the facilities listed are minimums the
starport must have installed.

Note that while a space station might qualify as a
starport by having the right facilities, that does not
necessarily mean it is classified as one. Commercial
pressures might force the designated starport to be
elsewhere in the system or the local government might
forbid a space station from being used for this purpose.

Space Stations

By adjusting Tech Levels, many ship components can
be upgraded or downgraded depending on the needs
and capabilities desired by the ship’s designer. Superior
components provide enhanced performance while
lesser components may be installed to reduce costs or,
in the case of a lower-tech world, to provide prototype
technology before it might otherwise be available.

After being in service for any length of time, ship
components can be damaged, destroyed or made
obsolete by higher technology. This chapter provides
rules for refitting ships with new components and the
associated costs of doing so.

# C USTOMISING SHIPS

ALTERING TECH LEVELS


The Tech Level, price and tonnage of components
can be adjusted while a ship is being designed. Ships
built at higher or lower Tech Levels have one or more
Advantages or Disadvantages applied to reflect the
effect of higher or lower technology.

In the design sequence, every component that can be
mounted on a ship has a minimum Tech Level listed,
which dictates when it normally comes available. The
pulse laser on page 29, for example, is listed as being

Tech Levels, although they will be less capable and
more advanced versions become available at higher
Tech Levels.

When selecting prototype (lower TL) or advanced (higher TL) components, use the Prototype/Advanced
table to alter its TL, tonnage and cost, and to determine
how many Advantages or Disadvantages it acquires.
Advantages and Disadvantages are then selected from
a suitable category in this chapter or the Referee and
Travellers can create their own.

A component may have either Advantages or
Disadvantages but not both.

Where the Referee deems it appropriate, the same
Advantage or Disadvantage can be applied more than
once to a component, increasing or decreasing its
quality. All alterations are additive. For example, if two
+10% alterations are taken, the net modification is 20%.

Make sure to only recalculate per the description.
For example, when an Advantage or Disadvantage
increases or decreases the size of a component,
calculate the modified price based on the original size
of the item, not the modified size.

**JUMP DRIVE ADVANTAGES
Decreased Fuel:** This drive uses 5% less fuel then normal.
**Early Jump:** This drive can jump 10% closer to a
gravity well than normal (90 diameters, as detailed on
page 157 of the Traveller Core Rulebook).
**Energy Efficient:** This jump drive consumes 25% less
Power than normal.
**Size Reduction:** This reduces the tonnage consumed
by the jump drive by 10%. This can take the drive
below the minimum size of 10 tons.
**Stealth Jump:** A stealth jump drive minimises the burst
of radiation caused by the transition from jump space
into real space. Normally, a ship that emerges into real
space is automatically detected if it emerges within
the minimum detail range of the sensor. However,
detecting a ship equipped with a stealth drive emerging
into real space requires a Formidable (14+) Electronics (sensors) check (1D rounds, INT or EDU) if it is within
the ‘limited’ detail range of the sensors or automatically
fails if outside the minimum detail range. Stealth jump
requires two Advantages.

**JUMP DRIVE DISADVANTAGES
Energy Inefficient:** This jump drives consumes 30%
more Power than normal.
**Late Jump:** This jump drive needs to be 50% further
from a gravity well than normal (150 diameters, as
detailed on page 157 of the Traveller Core Rulebook).
**Increased Size:** This increases the tonnage consumed
by the jump drive by 25%.

MANOEUVRE DRIVE ADVANTAGES


Energy Efficient: This manoeuvre drive consumes
25% less Power than normal.
Size Reduction: This reduces the tonnage consumed
by the manoeuvre drive by 10%.

MANOEUVRE DRIVE DISADVANTAGES


Energy Inefficient: This manoeuvre drive consumes

Orbital Range: This manoeuvre drive only functions
when the ship is within Short range (up to 1,250
kilometres) of a planetary body. Orbital range requires
two Disadvantages.

less Power than normal.
Increased Size: This increases the tonnage consumed
by the power plant by 25%.

WEAPON AND SCREEN ADVANTAGES


Referees might want to restrict the use of these rules
with spinal mount weapons, as they already have their
own table for varying Tech Levels.

Accurate: Accurate weapons gain DM+1 to all attack
rolls. Accurate requires two Advantages.
Easy to Repair: Easy to Repair weapons grant DM+1
to all attempts made to repair them.
Energy Efficient: This weapon consumes 25% less
Power than normal.

Customising Ships



High Yield: When rolling damage for a High Yield
weapon or the performance of a High Yield screen,
any ‘1’s rolled are counted as ‘2’s. Not applicable for
missiles and torpedoes.
Very High Yield: When rolling damage for a Very High
Yield weapon or the performance of a Very High Yield
screen, any ‘1’s and ‘2’s rolled are counted as ‘3’s. Very
High Yield requires two Advantages. Not applicable for
missiles and torpedoes.
Intense Focus: These weapons are more tightly
focused allowing them to better cut through armour.
Intense Focus weapons gain AP+2. Intense Focus can
only be applied to lasers and particle weapons. Intense
Focus requires two Advantages.
Long Range: The range for the weapon is increased
by one band, to a maximum of Very Long. For example,
a Long Range beam laser will change from Medium to
Long range. Long Range requires two Advantages and
may only be applied once.
Resilient: The Severity of all critical hits upon a
Resilient weapon is reduced by -1.
Size Reduction: This reduces the tonnage consumed by
the weapon by 10%. Not applicable to turret weapons.

WEAPON AND SCREEN DISADVANTAGES


Energy Inefficient: This weapon consumes 30% more
Power than normal. Not applicable to turret weapons.
Inaccurate: This weapon suffers from continual
alignment problems, inflicting DM-1 to all attack rolls.
Increased Size: This increases the tonnage consumed
by the weapon by 20%.

REFITTING SHIPS


Over the course of a ship’s lifespan, its components
may be modified or replaced. Sometimes this occurs
after the ship has suffered damage in space combat
or otherwise. Damaged and destroyed components
can be replaced at starports of an appropriate Tech
Level, provided that they have replacement parts
and technology on hand. Components may also be
replaced in order to upgrade or downgrade a ship’s

capabilities. Tech Levels vary from world-to-world and
Travellers who want to install better sensor arrays,
improve the lethality of their weapons or otherwise
enhance their ships have many choices.

All refits must take place at starports of Class B or
above and jump drives can only be removed and fitted
at Class A starports. Any refitting, even if it just the
removal of minor systems, takes up shipyard capacity
equal to the tonnage of the ship that is undergoing refit.

There are two different types of refit that can be used.
Major refits cover changes in power plant, manoeuvre
or jump drive, as well as changes to spinal mounts
or launch facilities (such as launch tubes). Removing
these components costs 0.5 times the cost of the
original system, while removing them and then
installing new ones costs 1.5 times the cost of the
new system. The time this takes is one quarter of the
time required to build a new ship of the same size as
described in Construction Times on page 8.

Minor refits are changes to any other components
aboard the ship, such as weapon mounts or
staterooms. Removing these components costs 0.1
times the cost of the original system, while removing
them and installing new ones costs 1.1 times the cost
of the new system. This takes one tenth of the time
required to build a new ship of the same size. Armour
and other parts of the ship integral to the hull (such
as configuration or reinforced structure) cannot be
changed under any refit. Those items covered under
a major refit cannot be increased in size but they can
be reduced. Other components can be increased in
size if there is tonnage available. If several systems
or components are being removed or replaced in a
single refit, all replacements are made simultaneously;
therefore, it only takes the time required for the longest
job to be completed.

The time taken for a refit to be completed can be
modified in the same way as ship construction, such as
allocating additional shipyard space or the presence of
higher technology.

Customising Ships

A ship’s computer shares much in common with
portable systems but is immensely more powerful. The
complex calculations required for quick and easy travel
between planets and using jumpspace need suitable
hardware with a lot more processing power. However,
while the computing power available to the average
merchant ship is staggering enough, capital ships
tend to carry multiple distributed networks that can
effectively provide unlimited processing potential.

This has led to the creation of software packages
far more advanced than those running on portable
computer systems, each granting a ship a wide range
of comprehensive capabilities that not only allow it to
travel safely and without error across the immense
distances between stars, but also function far more
effectively when it reaches its destination.

This chapter looks at advanced software available for
ship’s computers, although note that any sufficiently
powerful computer can run this software.

When selecting a ship’s computer, the first thing to do
is determine what software it needs to run. Then total
the Bandwidth required for each software package to
get a sense of the total Bandwidth needed. Be sure to
include the software packages listed on page 161 of
the Traveller Core Rulebook.

Keep two things in mind when selecting software;
first, make sure to select only the packages that the
ship needs to function. It is easy to get carried away,
packing in more than needed. For example, a ship
with a pair of double missile turrets does not require
expensive Launch Solution software. Nor does a tramp
trader need costly Evade software to function safely (most of the time). Second, consider that not all of a
ship’s software needs to run simultaneously, enabling
the designer to select a cheaper computer with less
Bandwidth. Determine which software packages need
to be running concurrently, add up their Bandwidth
consumption and let that figure inform software
purchasing decisions.

**ADVANCED FIRE CONTROL**
The basic Fire Control packages available to most
ships (see the Traveller Core Rulebook, page 161)
are suitable for small ships with a handful of turrets

# T HE SHIP'S COMPUTER

but they quickly surpass their capabilities on larger
vessels with multiple weapon systems. Advanced
Fire Control software utilises the greater processing
potential of capital ships to create an entire offensive
network that increases the efficiency of gunnery crew.
Note that Advanced Fire Control does not allow a ship’s
computer to fire any weapons itself, merely increasing
the accuracy of those who do. Advanced Fire Control
does not stack with Fire Control.

All weapons mounted upon the ship gain a DM to
their attack rolls equal to the Advanced Fire Control
package’s score (so, Advanced Fire Control/2 grants
DM+2 to all attack rolls).

ANTI-HIJACK
This software package constantly monitors airlocks,
access to critical areas and attempts to break into
computer systems. In the event it discovers an
anomaly, the software automatically shuts down access
to the affected area, making unauthorised attempts to
enter key areas and functions difficult. This is intended
to act as a ward against hijacking but also serves
as a strong security system. Any skill check made to
gain unauthorised entry to the ship’s computer or any
restricted area suffers a negative DM equal to double
the Anti-Hijack’s software score.

BATTLE NETWORK


The Battle Network software package enables a ship
to hand off target sensor detection data to all desired
ships within the specified range of the software. Battle
Network/1 enables hand-off to all ships within Medium



range. Battle Network/2 enables hand-off to all ships
within Long range. For more information about sensor
hand-offs, see Chapter 7: Sensors.

BATTLE SYSTEM


The Battle System software package is a complex suite
of programmes that interact with each other and other
ship-board systems to create a tactical view of fleet
actions. It then runs high-level simulations and makes
predictions to advise officers as to the correct course of
action. Any Traveller using Battle System gains a DM
to Tactics (naval) checks equal to the Battle System
package’s score (so, Battle System/2 grants DM+2).

BROAD SPECTRUM EW


While a software package cannot match a skilled
sentient electronics warfare officer, computers can
act much faster, disrupting entire salvoes in the time it
takes an operator to simply notice a launch. The Broad
Spectrum EW package continuously scans for hostile
missile launches and automatically sends disruptive
signals known to interfere with the guidance systems
of all common missiles. A single electronic warfare
action (with no crew skill DM applied) is automatically
performed against any and all enemy salvoes launched
within Long range. Each salvo can still only be subjected
to one electronic warfare action, so manual attempts to
disrupt salvoes should be performed beforehand.

CONSCIOUS INTELLIGENCE


A Conscious Intelligence is far more than a basic
Intellect package or a mere artificial intelligence. A
Conscious Intelligence is a fully aware, completely
sentient digital being, capable of thought, deduction,
analysis and, it appears in every measurable way,
emotion. A Conscious Intelligence is treated as a

computer-bound Traveller with INT 15 and EDU 15,
with a range of skills that can be uploaded, changed
and improved (typically in the skill level 3–5 range).
The Conscious Intelligence will have a name, an easily

except the biological, alive.

ELECTRONIC WARFARE


With access to the ship’s sensor suites, this software
package provides aid to the vessel’s electronic warfare
experts by quickly finding the correct frequencies to
disrupt a target and then applying massive processing
power to break through any firewall security.

All electronic warfare actions (see page 160 of the
Traveller Core Rulebook) performed from the ship gain
a DM to their Electronics (sensors) checks equal to

**POINT DEFENCE**
While any ship with a laser turret can engage in point
defence against incoming attacks, the computing power
required to effectively shield another ship is staggering,
relying on complex calculations of the trajectories of
enemy ships, friendly targets and the actual weapons
used. A ship running the Point Defence package may
use point defence batteries and the Point Defence (gunner) reaction to defend any ship within Close
range. The Point Defence/2 package increases this
range to Short.

**SCREEN OPTIMISER**
The Screen Optimiser package takes control of

attacks. It automatically performs the Angle Screens (gunner) action with a total DM+0, against any attack
and can use any number of screens simultaneously.

Software Bandwidth TL Cost

**VIRTUAL CREW**
While ships are vastly complicated to run, requiring
highly trained crews, relatively simple operations
can be performed by this software package. Virtual
Crew can replace up to five pilots, gunners or sensor
operators on board a ship, potentially allowing the
ship to act autonomously if all crew can be replaced
in this way. Indeed, ships can be designed without

a bridge, relying purely on this software package in
order to function as a drone. Ships that have no living
crew make appropriate checks with a skill level equal
to their Virtual Crew score and can also be controlled
through the use of the Electronics (remote ops) skill.
When using Electronics (remote ops), DM-2 is applied
to all checks made if the drone ship is at Long range
to the controller and DM-4 if it is at Very Long range.
A drone ship cannot be remotely controlled at Distant
ranges and must rely on its own programming. The
package can replace any number of crew, although it
requires +1 Bandwidth for every five crew or part of
beyond the first five.

VIRTUAL GUNNER


A Virtual Gunner package allows a ship’s computer to
replace living gunnery crew in an efficient manner. The
package can replace any number of gunners, although
it requires +1 Bandwidth for every 10 gunners or part
of beyond the first 10. Weapons controlled by a Virtual
Gunner have a skill level equal to the package’s score
but they can take advantage of other modifiers such
as Advanced Fire Control. On a military ship, one
virtual gunner may replace the gunner crewing a turret,
barbette, bay or screen.

The Ship's Computer

Space combat in the Traveller Core Rulebook assumes
that the combatants have detected each other with
sensors. However, initial detection of a ship relies upon
a number of factors.

Ships have two types of sensors: active and passive.
Active sensors are detectable by other ships because
they emit radiation that announces their presence when
detected by devices. For example, radar transmits and
receives radio waves, which enable a ship to detect
the location of ships and other objects; however,
other radar systems have receivers that detect the
transmission and trace it back to its source.

Passive sensors are not detectable by other ships
because they receive data without emitting tell-tale
information about the source of the sensor. For
example, thermal sensors detect the presence of heat
but do not require any emissions to be made in the
process. Objects that give off heat, such as other ships,
are detectable by thermal sensors.

Multiple sensor devices are available, including
visual, thermal (infrared), radar, lidar, neural
activity sensors (NAS) and densitometers. Sensor
packages from Basic to Advanced are described
on page 21, including which sensors are provided
with each package. The functions of each sensor

# S ENSORS

type are described on page 55 of the Traveller Core
Rulebook. Of the options listed, only active radar/lidar
significantly aids detection by other sensors.

In civilised space, ships often run their active sensors
to obtain more detailed data about their surroundings.
However, there are many instances in which it is wise
to maintain a lower profile. Doing so requires careful
management of a ship’s sensory systems and this is
the job of the ship’s sensor operator, often referred to
as the sensop.

INITIAL DETECTION


Ships use a variety of sensors to collect information
about their surroundings. By combining data from
multiple sensor devices, a ship’s computer generates a
composite image of detected objects, giving the sensop
and their crew detailed information about the space
around them, including what and who is in it. Initial
detection by and of a ship depends, in part, upon which
sensor systems are running.

When a starship comes out of jump or during in-system
transit, their sensors detect hundreds if not thousands
of objects, depending on population and traffic in the
system. Beyond Distant range (more than 50,000
kilometres), most of these objects simply appear as
blips on a display, difficult to differentiate from each

other. Those that emit radio waves are assumed to
be ships, satellites or space stations. Those that do
not might be powered-down ships, planetoids, comets
or other objects. Without closer inspection, detailed
system charts or communication with other spacecraft
in the vicinity, it can be difficult to determine the exact
nature of many objects. For all intents and purposes,
the knowledge that these ships and other objects are
present is all that is needed; however, should one ship
need to approach another for boarding or to engage
in combat, more precise information is required. To
obtain this level of information, the ship’s sensop must
make an Average (8+) Electronics (sensors) check (1D minutes, EDU), adding DMs listed in the Initial
Detection table and DMs for the type of sensors being
used, as described under Install Sensors on page 21.

Success indicates that the data collected by the
sensop is enough to pinpoint the location of the ship,
whereupon the ship’s captain can decide whether to
allow an approach or engage in space combat. Failure
indicates that the location of the ship (or even that it is
a ship) cannot be accurately determined. Exceptional
failure means the object is not detected at all or just
assumed to be some inert object such as a planetoid,
defunct satellite or space junk. Note that attempting to
locate a ship with this level of accuracy requires the
use of active sensors.

In civilised space, it is expected that ships run with
transponders on at all times. While they are capable of
being deactivated temporarily, doing so can result in a
heavy fine, boarding or even an attack, depending on
the naval presence, government type and Law Level of
the system. On the frontier or in systems with an Amber
or Red travel code, Travellers are sometimes permitted
to operate without transponders under very specific
circumstances; for example, wilderness refuelling at a

gas giant, landing on a remote moon or other situations
in which they might be vulnerable to attack from pirates
or other troublemakers.

STEALTHED SHIPS


After initial contact, sensor detection is maintained
under most circumstances. However, sensor contact
with ships that have stealth may be lost if the range
between ships extends by one or more bands during
an encounter.

For example, at the start of combat, two ships – one
or both of whom has stealth technology – detect each
other at Short range but the range extends to Medium
during the next Manoeuvre Step. Ships with stealth
must be reacquired by the opposing sensop with a new
Average (8+) Electronics (sensors) check, adding the
following DMs.

Savvy stealth ship captains know how to ‘go dark’ after
distancing themselves from an opponent, shutting down
most or all systems that allow them to be detected.
This gives the stealthed ship a significant advantage
in combat, enabling them to select when to engage an
opponent if indeed they want to at all.

SENSOR HAND-OFFS
If multiple ships are engaged in combat, they can
communicate or ‘hand-off’ sensor data to each other
over their comms systems, enabling all ships to
have the same data, limited by range and available
computer Bandwidth.

For example, a squadron of four patrol vessels, all
within Long range of each other, might have different
sensor packages, three with Military grade sensors
and one with Advanced sensors. If the three ships with
Military grade sensors fail their checks but the one with

Sensors



Advanced sensors succeeds, all four ships may have
sensor detection of the target ship thanks to their ability
to share data.

A hand-off requires one point of available computer
Bandwidth from both the host and recipient ship. To
add to the example above, the ship with the Advanced
sensors has a Computer/15. The ship is using 10
Bandwidth to run an Evade/1 program, leaving it with
five points of available Bandwidth. Therefore, the ship
can hand-off its sensor data to a maximum of five other
ships, provided that each of them also has at least 1
Bandwidth available to receive the data. Ships that
receive hand-off sensory data cannot then hand-off that
data to additional ships.

In the illustration, the central
ship has successfully
detected the stealth ship
and has 5 Bandwidth free for
hand-offs. The other three
ships that are pursuing the
stealth ship have failed their
sensor checks but those
with available Bandwidth
can receive a sensor hand-off from the central ship.
The ship on the right has
no available Bandwidth;
therefore, it cannot receive
a sensor hand-off and does
not detect the stealth ship.
However, the other two have
the available Bandwidth, so
they detect the stealth ship
and may attack it as normal.

Hand-offs have limitations.
If one or more of the ships
in a hand-off strays beyond
Distant range, the connection
is lost. This does not mean
the ships have lost comms
with each other; merely that
the range is too great to
accurately convey sensor
data in real time. In addition,
if the target ship makes a
successful electronic warfare
check against any of the
ships in the squadron, that ship loses comms contact
with the other ships, breaking the hand-off. In this
scenario, the target ship could engage in electronic
warfare with the ship that has Advanced sensors, and a
successful check breaks its contact with the oter ships
in the squadron. Note that electronic warfare does not
cause any ships that have established sensor contact
with the target on their own to lose that contact. It only
breaks hand-off communications between the ships.

Note that computer cores, which are typically used by
capital ships, are vastly more powerful, and multiply
available Bandwidth points by 10 for this purpose,
allowing them to hand-off data to entire squadrons. In
addition, ships may obtain Battle Network software to
enable them to hand-off sensor data to all allied ships
within range. For more information, see The Ship’s
Computer on page 73.

# E XOTIC TECHNOLOGY

The ship design rules covered in previous chapters
cover a broad range of technologies, up to around
TL15. While technology beyond this is rare in Charted
Space, it can exist and in other universes might be
common to the extent of ubiquity.

This chapter introduces a range of new technologies
that can be used as part of the design process to
create some truly awesome and unusual ships. Some
of these technologies extend far beyond the Tech
Levels that are typically available in the Charted Space
universe and some are within those technological
boundaries but are not allowed for various reasons.
These technologies should be considered optional and
may be added to any Traveller campaign as desired.

NEW DRIVES


Among the most fundamental technologies a ship
uses are its drives: the jump drive, manoeuvre drive
and power plant. The drives detailed here can be
used as additions or complete replacements to those
presented in previous chapters. If they are intended
as replacements for any of the standard drive
technologies, then a Referee is free to reduce the TL
required for a drive by as much as 8–10 levels in order
to make them fit into the existing Tech Level structure.

**HOP DRIVE**
The hop drive is similar in principle to the jump drive,
but performs at an order of magnitude higher, enabling
hops in the tens of parsecs. Hop drives have the same
minimum size, as well as fuel and power consumption,
as jump drives of the same rating. Select the desired
hop score and use the figure in the Hop Potential
table as the percentage of the ship’s hull that the hop

drive will consume, then add five tons. A hop drive
must be a minimum of 10 tons and they cost MCr15
per ton. Much like jump technology, each hop requires
approximately one week of travel time. The hop drive
first appears at TL17.

In addition to making hops possible, Hop Control
software reduces the distance in parsecs – for
purposes of calculating DM for Astrogation checks

- by 10 rounding up (minimum one). As with Jump

Control, the cost of Hop Control software is waived if
the ship has a Core computer

HYPERDRIVE


An alternate method of crossing the vast distances
between the stars, the hyperdrive opens a temporary
portal into hyperspace which the ship physically
flies into. While within hyperspace, the ship uses its
conventional manoeuvre drive to travel, although the
effect of hyperspace is to greatly magnify its effect
in relation to realspace. Once at its destination, the
hyperdrive opens a new portal which leads the ship
back into realspace.

Hyperdrives cost MCr2 per ton.

A hyperdrive consumes no fuel and, while in
hyperspace, the spacecraft moves a number of parsecs
equal to its Thrust per hour, up to a maximum of the
hyperdrive’s rating. This is the equivalent distance
moved in realspace, and determines where the
spacecraft appears once it emerges from hyperspace.

Power Requirements: In order to use the hyperdrive,
the ship requires an amount of Power equal to the
hyperdrive’s total tonnage.

SKIP DRIVE


The skip drive is similar in principle to the hop drive but
performs at an order of magnitude higher still, enabling
skips in the hundreds of parsecs. Skip drives have
the same minimum size, as well as fuel and power
consumption, as jump drives of the same rating. Select
the desired skip score and use the figure in the Skip
Potential table as the percentage of the ship’s hull that
the skip drive will consume, then add 5 tons. A skip
drive must be a minimum of 10 tons and they cost
MCr150 per ton. Much like jump technology, each skip
requires approximately one week of travel time. The
skip drive first appears at TL20.

In addition to making skips possible, Skip Control
software reduces the distance in parsecs, for purposes
of calculating DM for Astrogation checks, by 100
rounding up (minimum one). As with Jump Control, Skip
Control's cost is waived if the ship has a Core computer.

WARP DRIVE


The warp drive is similar in effect to a hyperdrive,
but instead of entering hyperspace it creates a
warp ‘bubble’ around the ship, effectively stretching

spacetime. The ship can now travel many times the
speed of light but does so in realspace. In every other
way, it functions in the same fashion as a hyperdrive.

SPACE FOLDING DRIVE


Using a space folding drive, a ship instantaneously
jumps from one point to another. This works just like the
standard jump drive on page 15 but there is no weeklong
wait in hyperspace. No time whatsoever elapses during
the transition from one place to another but the drive
must recharge for 24 hours before it can be used again.
A space folding drive must be a minimum of 20 tons.
Space folding drives cost MCr3 per ton.

Power Requirements: In order to use the space
folding drive, the ship requires an amount of Power
equal to 50% of the hull’s total tonnage multiplied by
the space folding drive rating. No fuel is consumed.

TIME DRIVE


This drive manipulates the fabric of time and space
around the ship, allowing it to travel through time rather
than space. It is capable of moving the ship forward or
backward in time, allowing Travellers inside the ability
to create all kinds of paradoxes.

Like other drives, it uses a power plant for its function
and consumes a certain amount of tonnage. The
maximum period of movement possible (hours, days,
months, years and so forth) is dependent on the
percentage of hull volume the drive uses – the larger the
time drive is proportional to the hull it is installed within,
the greater amount of time can be travelled in a single
jump, as detailed on the Time Drive Potential table.

The time drive can move a ship up to six of the
increments listed. So, for example, a time drive-3 could
move a ship forward or backward in time up to six
hours. The fuel required to do so is equal to:

2.5% of ship’s hull x time drive rating.

Time drives cost MCr5 per ton.

Power Requirements: In order to use the time drive,
the ship requires an amount of Power equal to 25% of
the hull’s total tonnage multiplied by the time drive.

NEW WEAPONS


As new technology becomes available or research
goes down different paths, a variety of new weapons or
new implementations of weapons begin to appear.

**QUAD TURRETS**
There is a practical limit to how many weapons can be
placed within a turret but, at the same time, there are
always engineers who like to push the limits on what
is considered possible. Quad turrets are rare and not
especially efficient but pack a serious punch and have
potential for intimidation alone.

Quad turrets provide DM+3 on point defence.

Mount TL Power Tons Cost
Quad Turret 12 2 1 MCr2

**ANTIMATTER SPINAL MOUNT**
A massive weapon of truly awesome potential, the
antimatter spinal mount uses electromagnetic forces
to funnel a stream of antimatter particles to a target,
where they react violently to cause devastating
damage. While only the most advanced vessels can
utilise this weapon, they are true fleet killers when they
appear in a system.

**PLASMA-PULSE CANNON**
Plasma-pulse cannons use bolts or pulses of hydrogen
plasma funnelled within an electromagnetic field. Upon
striking a target, it vaporises any surface it contacts.
While relatively power-hungry, plasma-pulse technology
is readily adaptable at any size of weapon and is
capable of delivering a series of strikes rapidly.

**NEUTRON LASER**
An advanced development of the humble beam laser,
neutron lasers are large weapons that require bay
installations to handle their size but they are true
capital ship armaments. Neutron lasers are cannon-

sized beam lasers that are stabilised by a neutron
flow for greater stability – this greatly enhances their
damage potential.

SOLAR PULSE GENERATOR


The solar pulse generator is a highly unusual weapon
that is distributed across the hull of an entire ship, using
massive amounts of power to generate a pulse that
affects all nearby ships, shorting out their systems and
disabling them.

A solar pulse generator has capacitors installed,
allowing the 2,000 Power required to fire it to be
added incrementally over time. However, once it has
started charging, it must be fired within 10 rounds or be
discharged safely, a process that takes 1D rounds. If
this is not done, the generator overloads and inflicts its
damage upon its ship while discharging.

When fired, the solar pulse generator automatically
damages every ship within range except the firing ship.

SUPER LASER


A term used to describe a wide range of different
technological implementations, the result is always the
same; a vast and awesomely powerful directed laser
beam capable of tearing ships and – when built large
enough – even planets apart. While hugely inefficient,
both in terms of power and cost, super lasers have no
practical limit when it comes to scalability.

TACHYON CANNON


This weapon fires a stream of high-speed tachyons that
pass through thick armour without being slowed by it.
Molecular bonded armour is immune to this effect and
tachyon cannons lose their AP trait when attacking a
ship so armoured.

NEW SCREENS


As weapons technology progresses, so too does that
of defensive measures. Energy screens, in particular,
become more ubiquitous as technology improves.

DEFLECTOR SCREENS


These are energy-based screens projected away
from a ship to deflect incoming attacks and reduce
the damage they cause. Deflector screens mitigate
damage from any weapon, reducing its damage by 1D (multiplied by the Effect of the angle screens action).

ENERGY SHIELDS


Seen as the ultimate in defence, energy shields do not
require dedicated gunners to ensure their effectiveness,
only engineers to feed them power. Energy shields,
when activated, form a permanent and invisible bubble
around a ship that absorbs incoming energy. So long as
the energy they can absorb is not overwhelmed rapidly,
the ship is kept safe from harm.

When a hit is scored, determine damage as normal,
including any Damage Multiples. Each energy shield
installed on a ship forms a ‘buffer’ of 10 points of
damage. All functioning energy shields on board
a ship combine to increase the damage they can
collectively absorb.

All damage a ship suffers is initially deducted from the
energy shields. When the energy shields have had their
buffer reduced to zero, all remaining damage is applied
to the ship as normal.

Each energy shield regenerates one point in its buffer
at the end of every round. A successful Difficult (10+)
Engineer (power) check (one round, INT) doubles the
rate of recovery for that round.

Improved energy shields contribute 20 points to the
energy buffer and regenerate two points at the end
of every round. Advanced energy shields contribute
50 points and regenerate five points at the end of
every round.

**WHITE GLOBE GENERATOR**
Similar in concept to the black globe generator, this
defensive system is far more advanced, projecting
a glowing white barrier of energy around a ship that
absorbs incoming fire. However, unlike the black globe
generator, the white globe generator allows a ship to
function normally while it is in use, with no restrictions
on sensors, manoeuvres or attacks.

White globe generators are available only at TL20 or
above and are extremely rare. They consume 50 tons
and, when available, cost at least MCr1000. They
require 100 Power.

As the energy of attacks absorbed by the generator is
channelled to capacitors, a ship must have sufficient
capacity if it is to avoid overloading its systems
and explode catastrophically. Fortunately, if a ship
possesses a jump drive, it already has a considerable
number of capacitors. A jump drive has capacitors
equal to 20% of its size in tons. Additional capacitors
may be purchased at a cost of MCr3 per ton. Each ton
of capacitors absorbs 50 points of damage.

If a ship with a white globe generator absorbs more
damage than its capacitors can handle, the ship
automatically explodes and is instantly destroyed.

To avoid this, the capacitors can be discharged. For every
combat round the white globe generator is switched off, the
capacitors discharge an amount of damage equal to 1% of
the ship’s total tonnage multiplied by 10% of the tonnage of
the ship’s power plant.

NEW OPTIONS


Advanced systems installed on board a ship can
radically alter its capabilities, allowing it to perform
beyond the specifications of what is considered ‘normal’
in the galaxy.

COLLECTORS


These are accumulators, sweeping up exotic particles
captured by a canopy and removing the need to carry
separate fuel for the jump drive. This charge is released
in a single spike to power a jump drive; collectors
cannot be used for normal ship operations.

Collectors become available at TL14. They consume
1% of a ship’s tonnage multiplied by the maximum jump
number its drive is capable of, plus five tons. They cost
MCr0.5 per ton.

It takes a week of normal space travel to fully charge
an accumulator and accumulators do not work in jump
space, in an atmosphere or on a ship expending thrust.

GRAVITY WELL GENERATOR


This complex device creates an artificial although
temporary gravity well across a large area of space,
making the process of jumping extremely dangerous.
It is typically used by navies and system patrol craft to
trap pirates and other lawbreakers, stopping them from
escaping to jumpspace before they can be boarded or
destroyed. Enterprising pirates, however, sometimes
use them to stop defenceless merchants from fleeing.

A gravity well generator becomes available at TL16
and costs MCr120. It consumes 100 tons and requires
500 Power to function. It projects a gravity well across
300,000 kilometres with the same effect on jumping
ships as being within the 100 diameter limit of a planet
or star (see page 157 of the Traveller Core Rulebook).

At TL17, a more powerful gravity well generator
with greater range becomes available. This version
consumes 300 tons and 1,200 Power points. Its gravity
well extends 1,200,000 kilometres and costs MCr360.

Exotic technology



JUMP FILTERS


An advanced modification inserted between a ship’s
computer and its sensor suite, jump filters search for
very specific traces created by expended fuel and
broken jump envelopes in order to track the direction
and location of a ship’s jump. With detailed analysis,
this allows a prediction of which star system a ship
has jumped to.

In order to use a jump filter, a ship must be previously
detected and its jump witnessed. A Very Difficult (10+)
Electronics (sensors) check (1D rounds, INT) enables
the operator to determine where the ship has jumped.

Jump filters become available at TL14. They consume
no tonnage but require 5 Bandwidth from the ship’s
computer, 1 Power and cost MCr5.

PSIONIC TECHNOLOGY


The use of psionics can be hated, feared or illegal in
many universes. However, the sheer impact psionics
can have on any dynamic in space, be it battle or trade,
is too great to ignore. High technology is therefore used
to degrade or enhance psions in space.

PSIONIC CAPACITOR


Through a combination of exotic matrices and carefully
engineered crystalline technologies, the psionic
capacitor is an effective artificial storage system for
psionic energies, which can be drawn upon by any
psion on board the ship.

A psion must succeed at an Average (8+) PSI check (free action) to gain access to the capacitor every time
they wish to draw PSI points from it. The psion can then
use any amount of PSI points present in the capacitor
for any psionic power used in the same round.

A psionic capacitor becomes available at TL18. It
costs MCr10 per ton and consumes 10 Power per ton.
It can hold a maximum number of PSI points equal to
10 times its tonnage and automatically regenerates
one PSI point per ton every hour, so long as sufficient
Power is available.

PSION STATEROOM


This stateroom is equipped with psionically calibrated
mood-calming environment sensors that promote
peace and relaxation. This allows a psion to greatly
increase the regeneration of their powers after using
them and expending their psionic points.

A psion stateroom is identical to a normal stateroom
in every way but a psion within increases their PSI
regeneration rate by +50%.

A psion stateroom becomes available at TL12. It
consumes four tons and costs MCr2.

PSIONIC SHIELDING


Incorporating exotic metals as a matrix embedded
within the hull of a ship can make it extremely difficult
for clairvoyants and telepaths to use their powers
within shielded areas. While this technology is difficult
to employ and of limited effect, any edge can be
worthwhile if a captain wishes to protect themselves
from psions.

Psions using Clairvoyance or Telepathy powers suffer a
penalty within this ship or upon its occupants. However,
the shielding is most effective on small vessels and
larger vessels tend to develop ‘holes’ that a cunning
psion can exploit.

Ships above 500 tons receive no DM. The penalty for
Clairvoyance and Telepathy powers is DM-4 for ships of
300 tons or less and DM-2 for ships of 500 tons or less.
Ships of less than 100 tons are completely impenetrable.

Psionic shielding becomes available at TL12. It
consumes 1% of the total tonnage of the ship and costs
Cr500000 per ton.

At TL16, advanced psionic shielding becomes
available. This consumes no tonnage and costs MCr1
per 100 tons, or part of, of the ship being shielded.

# C REW ROLES

A qualified crew with a broad range of skills is required to
operate a ship. This chapter describes each of the roles
that are listed in the Determine Crew step (page 22) of
spacecraft design. Additional roles and crew positions
might be required on specialised ships, such as those
used by the military, but the descriptions below should
provide a wider understanding of the responsibilities of
the core crew positions on most ships.

ADMINISTRATOR


The administrator role is only present on large
spacecraft, 2,000 tons or more for commercial ships
and 1,000 tons or more for military craft. Such ships
are rarely operated by private owners and are usually
corporate or government property. As valuable
investments, they are overseen by administrative staff,
some of whom might be high-ranking company or
military officers. An administrator is sometimes even
in command of the ship or the mission it is on. In such
cases, in addition to the crew, the chief admin usually
has a staff to whom they delegate the myriad tasks
that must be performed to keep the ship running and
its mission on track. The administrative staff include
accountants, clerks, pursers, personnel management (also called sophont resources), crew advocacy, liaison
officers, quartermasters, librarians, yeomen and others.

Administrators keep track of the ship’s fuel, supplies,
cargo, work schedules and oversee the progress of
a voyage, deployment or mission, noting completed
objectives and milestones that are achieved.
Freighters and military craft have a job to do and the
administrative staff are there to ensure it gets done
as efficiently as possible by taking care of all the little
details. The operational crew are present to get the ship
from point A to point B. Admins are there to ensure that
the ship’s mission is accomplished.

The best admins are sticklers for process. ‘If you play
by the rules, you win the game,’ is a common admin’s
refrain. Captains accustomed to uninhibited command
sometimes bristle at the presence of one or more
administrators but the larger the ship – and the larger
the administrative staff – the more they are tolerated
and, quite often, appreciated for their contributions.

The role of a ship’s administrator does not stop at
its bulkhead walls. An admin on a freighter, scout
or exploratory trader must know the laws, customs,
conventions and culture of each and every world on
its route. Should a problem arise when attempting to
dock the ship at a highport, getting approval to send
shuttles planetside or having cargo lots processed
through customs, administrators are present to
smooth things over.

The best administrators know the rules at each starport
as well or better than local officials. Likewise, admins
on military ships are experts at procurement. The
military often runs on a shoestring budget and quality
admins know how to get the most out of their Credits
and where the best supply scrounging is to be had.
Savvy procurement officers have a tendency to collect
the highest bonuses and get promoted more often.
Cutting through red tape and keeping the voyage or
mission going is one of their primary functions.

Some administrators also serve as a ship’s attorney.
In the Third Imperium, the law safeguards free trade
and assures safe travel between star systems. Many
Imperial laws are left deliberately vague but the best
space lawyers have memorised a great deal of legal
precedents to lean upon should adjudication be required.

THE ADMIN’S JOB IS NEVER DONE
Common task checks for the ship’s admin:

Check the ship’s logs to make sure nothing is amiss:
Routine (6+) Admin check (2D minutes, INT).

Negotiate a cheaper docking fee: Average (8+) Admin
or Broker check (INT or SOC). Adjust the docking fee
by Effect x 10%.

Recall local disembarkation customs: Difficult (10+)
Admin or Advocate check (1D rounds, EDU). Success
gives the admin time to inform crew before they leave
the ship. Failure results in an offence to the locals and
future SOC-oriented tasks are made at DM-2.

Obtain clearance to land at a downport on a high Law
Level world: Difficult (10+) Admin or Advocate check (1D hours, SOC).



THE PURSER


On all types of ships, the purser is responsible for
taking care of its finances. While they are routinely
part of a ship’s administrative staff, pursers may
be found on ships as small as 200-ton tramp
traders. On a merchant starship, the purser might
well have the most important role of all. In fact,
the captain sometimes doubles as the purser on
smaller merchant spacecraft. A merchant purser
handles all freight, cargo, mail and passenger
transactions at the various ports that it visits. The
key skill for such transactions is Broker but many
other skills come into play as well, depending on
the scope of the purser’s job.

Travelling from one star system to the next, the
worlds that a starship crew encounters can be vastly
different from each other. One world might feature a
freewheeling semi-anarchy while the next might be
governed by an authoritarian dictator or oligarchy.
Advocate skill helps the purser to navigate the
hazardous legal landscape of each world. Knowing
legal particulars can also help prevent Travellers
from inadvertently bringing contraband onto a world.
Just because a certain cargo is legal in one system
does not mean that it will be in the next.

The Admin skill can help a purser cut through
procedural red tape. For an independent free trader,
it is essential that the ship keeps moving. A ship’s
operating costs or mortgage do not pay themselves
and time is money. The cadence for tramp traders
is to jump into system, work their way in from the
100-diameter limit to the starport, establish contact
with a local brokerage, engage in trade and then
depart the system. This typically takes 1-2 weeks,
enabling most traders to make two jumps per month,
sometimes three. In the process, Travellers can find
themselves denied docking privileges, hung up in
customs or at the mercy of a corrupt or supercilious
port authority agent. A competent administrator
knows how to get through hold-ups like these. Many
ships have dedicated administrators to perform these
tasks but some degree of knowledge on the part of
the purser enables them to present a united front.

Pursers with the Diplomat skill are politically savvy, using
their intellects or social connections to set up the best
deals possible. Persuade skill might work as a substitute
for Diplomat depending on the circumstances.

Once they manage to get through any bureaucratic
unpleasantness, the purser uses their Broker,
Carouse or Streetwise skill to find passengers,
cargo, freight and mail to transport. Refer to Trade
on page 238 of the Traveller Core Rulebook for
more information on finding suppliers and brokering
deals. Making contact with an individual broker or
brokerage house, meeting with them to discuss
business, making deals and both delivering and
receiving goods makes for a busy week or more.
On a small ship, there is too much to do for a single
person so the purser often involves other members
of the crew to get things done. On a larger ship, they
might have an administrative staff to work with but,
even then, the purser will tap the expertise of other
crew members to help get the work done no matter
what their specialisations are. Pursers often work
in close concert with the ship’s stewards, especially
with regards to the passengers.

On a larger ship, such as a Leviathan merchant
cruiser, Al Morai Type MK transport or Galika
Megula-class megafreighter, the purser takes on
a more expansive role and must have a greater
understanding of finance and economics. Making
trade deals, establishing new freight runs and forging
corporate relationships requires more expertise.

The purser must be an expert improviser. This goes
without saying on exploratory ventures into the
frontiers and wild outlands beyond the safe borders
of an interstellar polity. However, even on tried-and-true trade routes, pursers must learn to expect the
unexpected. Information only travels at the speed of
jump and circumstances can change from one port
of call to the next.

On military craft, the purser’s job is quite different.
Usually only assigned to capital ships (more than
5,000 tons), the purser and their staff are responsible
for keeping the ship supplied. There is a common
misconception that destroyers, cruisers and
battleships – which are expensive – have unlimited
resources. The reality is quite the opposite. Keeping
a military ship properly supplied is always a challenge
and there are opposed forces at work. A well-supplied
ship is one with high morale. While a ship’s captain
strives to keep their ship amply supplied at all times,
they have a limited budget to work with. The purser
is the manager of these funds and their career

Crew Roles

Make sure the speculative cargo goods the purser
bought are of the expected quality. Opposed: Difficult (10+) Admin or Broker check (INT) versus a Difficult (10+) Deception check (INT).

Convince port authority agents that the illegal goods
the ship is carrying are legal and there is no need to
examine them further: Very Difficult (12+) Admin or
Advocate check (1D minutes, SOC). Success means
the goods are not inspected. Failure indicates they are
impounded and the Travellers are fined for carrying
contraband or smuggled goods. Exceptional failure
means the Travellers are jailed for 2D days and then
fined 2D x Cr10000 before being released. This task
can be proceeded by a Difficult (10+) Advocate check (2D hours, EDU) in a task chain in order to cite or
fabricate legal precedents that might reduce fines or jail
sentences. Add the Task Chain DM.

ASTROGATOR


Astrogators are only required on jump-capable
spacecraft. The astrogator is responsible for keeping
track of where the Travellers’ starship is and where
it is going. Jump drives enable Travellers to get from
one star system to another and the astrogator’s main
job is to make sure that they get to their destination
safely. The course is plotted with the aid of a starship’s
astrogation computer but the astrogator must make key
decisions regarding the departure point, jump distance
and estimated arrival point. In addition, qualified
astrogators understand astronomy and jumpspace
physics well enough to calculate the basic course

advancement largely depends on their ability to
be frugal but also to keep the ship appropriately
supplied. On long deployments, it can be quite a
challenge to maintain the ship’s supplies, spares
and stores, especially if the ship’s mission takes
them into foreign or uncharted territory. Pursers
must become resourceful to do their jobs well
under such circumstances but those who manage
to tread the fine line of staying under budget
without adversely affecting morale tend to rise
through the ranks rapidly. For more information,
see Supplies, Spares and Stores on page 53, and
refer to the Naval Campaigns Handbook from the
Element Class Cruisers set.

without the aid of a computer. This takes more time but
any astrogator worth their salt can plot a course with
minimal technology if necessary.

Calculating a jump is relatively easy for one-parsec
trips but becomes considerably more difficult as the
distance increases. Simply put, ships with longer jump
ranges must have more experienced astrogators or
they risk missing their target, or worse, misjumping.
Astrogators are also put to the test when they have
to plot early jumps. Starships must typically reach
a distance of 100 diameters from any object before
engaging the jump drive. However, there are times
when Travellers might want to get out of a star system
quickly. Jumping before reaching the 100-diameter limit
puts a great deal of stress on the jump drive and greatly
increases the possibility of a misjump. An astrogator’s
accurate course becomes all the more important under
such circumstances.

Astrogators determine when a ship will come out of
jump when plotting their course. If the ship making the
jump is part of a fleet, the ships’ astrogators can share
data in order to synchronise jump exits. Synchronised
jumps are important in military operations and situations
in which one does not want to come out of jump alone,
such as when travelling in a convoy. Even if one’s
‘fleet’ is a couple of armed traders and a scout ship, the
synchronised arrival of a decent-sized group might be
enough to deter pirates or other troublemakers.

Plotting courses between stars is the essential job of an
astrogator but an overlooked aspect of the astrogator’s
responsibilities occurs in normal space between jumps.
When in normal space, the astrogator may work in
tight concert with the ship’s pilot and sensor operator
to track where they are, where they are going and what
planets, asteroids, orbital starports and other objects
are in their vicinity.

When assisting the pilot in normal space, an astrogator
has three primary tools: the astrogation computer,
sensor array data and an interface with engineering.
The astrogation computer interacts with the jump drive
when engaging in interstellar travel. Sensor array
data provides information about their surroundings in
normal space. When coming out of jumpspace, the first
question the astrogator wants answered is ‘Where am
I?’. The astrogation computer analyses data from the
sensor arrays, library program, recorded data from the
flight computer and data gleaned from local satellite
arrays and starport control, when available. The
engineering interface enables the astrogator to submit
their course to the ship’s engineer who tunes, prepares
and engages the jump drive to make the journey.

Crew Roles

**THE PURSER (CONTINUED)**



When one is in the Regina system and planning on a
jump to Yori – a mere two parsecs away – the astrogator
has access to an immense amount of data that is used
to ascertain where the ship is and where it is going with
pinpoint accuracy. There is less data for backwater
systems, whose available resources might be slim and
none but the starship’s computer and sensor array can
be used to perform a basic system survey within hours,
giving the astrogator what is needed.

Once a spacecraft is in flight, the astrogator sees a
display of ‘known objects’, things that are expected to
be present in the current star system. These include
orbital starports, satellite arrays, near-planet objects
such as asteroids and comets and other things for
which there is a historical record of existence and
location. Sensor array data provides a plethora of
information, which is fed to the astrogation computer
that then guesses in advance what the astrogator might
want to do next, providing scenarios for a series of
potential courses.

When flying ‘nap-of-the-earth’ to a destination on the
other side of the planet, astrogation data provides
an array of choices for the pilot to make. Weather
patterns are obtained from local data sources, if any,
or predictions based on the meteorology of the local
region or that which the computer observed during
planetfall. This is where Astrogation gives way to the
Navigation skill. Once within nap-of-the-earth range,
Navigation is used to accurately get Travellers to
their destination.

When taking the ship into orbit, the astrogation
computer checks in with the local starport, if present.
The computer checks the starport’s data and places
all known objects in cache, not displaying them until
after their presence is confirmed by sensors. Once
the sensors detect new ships or other objects, the
computer updates the local traffic display and presents it
graphically to the astrogator. Known or expected objects
have a greater amount of data available. New objects
are presented with whatever is known: transponder IDs,
power signatures, basic size and shape coalesce into a
presentation that evolves as the sensors and other data
sources obtain more information.

Jump drives are primarily tuned for travel between
gravity wells, deftly staying outside of the 100-diameter
limits of stars, planets and other objects. Jump courses
rely upon those gravity wells as points of contact.
Making jumps into deep space – empty hexes on a

starmap – far from any discernible gravity wells, is
a risky undertaking. Experienced astrogators learn
how to do it by triangulating: they anchor their desired
destination point to the last visited gravity well and
known far-off gravity wells that are one or more parsecs
away. The calculations for deep space jump exits are
complicated and missteps can be hazardous. If the
numbers are wrong, the ship may exit jump in the
wrong spot, making it difficult to recalibrate and make
the next jump.

The astrogator role is the only one that most species in
Charted Space do not automate. Astrogation is more
than just starmaps and complicated mathematical
calculations. It is an art form.

CAPTAIN


The captain of a ship is its leading officer, assigned to
command for a specified period of time or indefinitely,
until relieved or otherwise dispossessed of that
command. The captain executes this duty based upon
rules or guidelines such as the interstellar laws of
the region in which the ship operates. In the Charted
Space universe, this would usually be Imperial law.
The captain must also observe the rules imposed
by the owner of the ship whether that be the navy,
a merchant line, the scout service or even a single
patron or owner aboard. The ship itself may also have
rules and regulations. For example, if the ship is a
naval destroyer, the captain must carry out the role
assigned to such a craft, being careful not to exceed
that role but also making sure that the ship performs
its duties to the fullest.

Being a captain does not necessarily mean that one
knows how to carry out each and every role on a
ship. For example, the captain need not be a qualified
pilot, astrogator, gunner or engineer to do the job. The
captain must only know the intended mission of the
ship and command the crew to perform that mission.
Most captains rise to their rank by showing competence
in one or more crew roles but there are exceptions.
The captain of a large merchant vessel might be an
expert broker, administrator or other functionary who
understands the mission of the ship and is therefore
qualified for command. On a military ship, the captain
might understand the concepts of naval tactics but
could have little to no experience in any of the crew
positions. The captain of a pirate vessel might simply
be the toughest person standing, fending off rivals
who would take the captaincy by force, if possible. The
captain might also simply be the owner aboard, the

Crew Roles

person who has majority or outright ownership of the
vessel. In some cases, the captain of a ship is simply
born to the role, as is the case for an Imperial noble,
Aslan clan leader or member of the Zhodani Zhobrdievl.

On smaller ships, the captain usually doubles as a
member of the crew. While pilots and astrogators are
the most common captains, there are no restrictions
that prevent any member of the crew from serving in
the role. Interstellar custom dictates that only ships of
100 tons or more have a captain. The commanding
officer on a small craft is called a skipper.

ENGINEER


An engineer’s work is never done. Engineers are
responsible for the maintenance and repair of the
ship’s drives, power and life-support systems. When
all systems are operating at peak performance, the
engineer’s job is simple: Monitor the ship’s functions
and, in the case of starships, engage the jump drive
when called upon to do so. Ships have a complex array
of equipment with hundreds of working components.
Keeping them all operating is difficult and demanding.

Life-support systems are perhaps the least
glamourous but most critical. The primary job of life
support is to maintain environmental integrity. A ship
without air cannot support its crew for any significant
length of time. All engineers understand the basic
principles of life support engineering: maintain
atmospheric pressure and oxygen levels, filter and
absorb carbon dioxide, maintain gravitic systems (g-compensation and artificial gravity), manage waste
and water supply, and provide for early detection
and suppression of fires. A ship’s g-compensation
system is designed to counter the amount of thrust
the ship has. If the ship’s maximum thrust is somehow
exceeded, the g-compensation may be pushed to
counter higher g-forces but only for a limited amount
of time and at the risk of damage to the system.

A journeyman’s knowledge of life-support systems and
due diligence is all one needs to keep them running
properly. Advanced training enables an engineer
to apply fine control to the various life-support
systems and to repair them quickly and efficiently.
Fine control includes limiting atmospheric pressure
and oxygen to specific compartments, altering the
output of the artificial gravity system and increasing
g-compensation, if necessary.

The ship’s drive systems include manoeuvre and
jump drives, with the former providing locomotion in
normal space and the latter enabling the ship to travel
interstellar distances in jumpspace. The function of
both drive systems is described in Ship Design on page

15. The manoeuvre-drive system includes separate

components for orientation and thrust with interfaces to
the power plant and ship’s computer. In addition, there
is some overlap with the life-support system, which
uses related gravitic technology for artificial gravity and
g-compensation.

The jump-drive draws power from the ship’s power
plant into energy sinks, which accumulate and
distribute the enormous amount of energy required to
create the jump bubble that protects the ship during its
transit through jumpspace. Perhaps the most complex
component of the drive is its jump governor, which
manages the distance of a jump, limited by the drive’s
jump rating. The jump drive requires a great deal of
care and maintenance. It is a complicated system
whose function is only partially understood. Engineers
understand how each of the jump drive’s individual
components work but jumpspace and transit through
it is a mysterious phenomenon, somewhat taken for
granted given the lack of complete understanding about
how it works.

There are several different types of power systems
available but most interstellar spacecraft use fusion
power plants, ranging from TL8–15, with greater
efficiency as technology increases. Higher technology
plants are more costly but provide more power per ton
and greater reliability.

Interfaces to the ship’s main engineering systems
are located in the drive room and the bridge but on
smaller, less-sophisticated ships, the latter may simply
be a terminal without a dedicated workstation. Most
engineers do their work in the engine room where the
drives and power plant are co-located on most designs.

While most of an engineer’s job is performed on the
interior of a ship, there are components on the exterior
that fall under their purview as well. First is the hull
itself, which can be viewed as the outermost layer of
the life-support system. The hull is also a separate
system, one upon which other features can be
attached. Turrets (if present) and sensors are partially
located on the exterior with their interfaces and much
of their electronics accessible from inside of the ship;
Mechanic and Electronics skill is required for their repair
and maintenance, respectively. Engineers are also
responsible for the fuel scoops, vents that take in raw

Crew Roles



gas or water that can be ‘cracked’ for their hydrogen
content and used as fuel. These, of course, lead to one
of the largest systems on any ship: the fuel tanks.

Engineers must be prepared to go anywhere within
or on their ship. While some exterior maintenance
and repairs can be done remotely with drones, most
engineers like to take a hands-on approach, which
requires competence in the use of vacc suits.

Maintenance activities are the bane of the engineer’s
existence. Refer to Running Costs and Maintenance
in the Spacecraft Operations section of the Traveller
Core Rulebook for more information. While this section
describes the concept of monthly maintenance,
the activities involved can actually be carried out
throughout the month.

However, the engineer need not be thought of as a
slave to the ship, forced to stay behind during every
adventure because they need to change out the
fuel lines or recalibrate the jump governor. Think of
maintenance tasks as a laundry list that must be
addressed on a monthly basis. The engineer can take
care of most or all of them all at once or spread them
out throughout the month as they see fit.

Engineers see the ship a lot differently than its crew or
passengers. They are fully aware of the machines that
enable it to do what it does while other crewmembers
are often content with the illusion that ‘things just work’.
The crew may be excused for their lack of intimate
knowledge about each and every component but those
in the engineering profession are often astounded
by how little most people know or understand about
ships’ systems. Engineers have a much greater
understanding of the inherent dangers of flying in a
compact vacuum-sealed container with a fusion reactor
inside, surrounded by tons of explosive liquid-hydrogen
fuel. Having just a little knowledge can be dangerous,
so most engineers are content to keep their craft to
themselves and only impart those bits of information
that the captain and crew need to know.

GUNNER


Gunners operate the weaponry and defences that ships
use in space combat. They have the glorious role of
firing ship weapons at enemy forces, wreaking damage
upon them with everything from the ‘brilliant lances’ of
laser weaponry and the potentially massive destruction
of a missile salvo, to particle and meson bays and
spinal mounts that can destroy other capital ships with
a single well-placed shot.

Over the immense distances involved in space combat,
it is extremely challenging to hit a target – especially
one that is actively evading and moving at a rate of
hundreds of kilometres per second – and it requires
more than just technology to do so. The successful
targeting and hitting of enemy ships, thousands of
kilometres distant, is made possible by advanced
sensors and computers, which aid in the detection and
selection of targets and prediction of where they might
be but it also requires an understanding of psychology
and a talent for reviewing analytics quickly and
efficiently. Gunners must make split-second decisions
based on what is ultimately incomplete information. A
talented gunner gets a feel for their opponents, based
on experience and recognisable tendencies. In this
regard, gunnery is more than just pulling a trigger or
pressing a launch button – it is also an art form.

Gunnery has four specialisations: turrets, ortillery,
screens and capital weapons. Turret, barbette and small-bay gunners are the ‘gunslingers’ of the profession,
solitary operators who rely more upon quick reflexes and
individual decision-making than other gunnery roles. In
addition, laser turret gunners have the secondary role of
point defence, switching their targeting computers from
enemy spacecraft to incoming missiles and torpedoes.
Point-defence gunnery requires a steady hand and
steely eyed focus. Missiles and torpedoes accelerate at
astounding speed, usually twice that of the fastest ship
one is likely to face and if they manage to detonate on
target, they can utterly devastate a ship. Sandcaster
gunners are the unsung heroes of the profession, using
an array of probabilities and psycho-tendency data to
deploy laser-mitigating chaff into the space between
one’s ship and the enemy. Lasers are the most common
weaponry on small ships and accurate sand deployment
can be the difference between life and death.

Ortillery gunners operate orbital strike and bombardment
weapons, designed to target terrestrial sites, whether
they be small, strategic targets or large ones such as
population centres. Ortillery differs from other gunnery
specialisations in that it must penetrate mediums other
than vacuum. Ortillery gunners have a complex array
of calculations to make based on atmospheric density,
geographic features and distance to ground zero, often
under tight time constraints. Approaching and attacking
enemy worlds can expose ships to the dangers posed
by close-orbit and airspace control command (COACC)
spacecraft and atmospheric fighter craft and drones,
as well as surface-to-space missiles and other anti-spacecraft weaponry, some of which might be protected
in deep-site installations that are difficult to penetrate.
Ortillery gunners usually take a clinical approach to

Crew Roles

their work. The knowledge that civilians may be killed
by ortillery can have adverse psychological effects if
their gunners do not learn to disassociate actions from
consequences caused.

Screen gunners are perhaps the most overlooked in
the profession but are extremely important in fleet
actions. Screens mitigate the damage of nuclear
and meson weapons, both of which can devastate
unprotected ships.

Investment in screens is expensive. Without
dedicating vast resources that could be applied
elsewhere, screens cannot be expected to completely
safeguard a ship. However, good screen gunners can
extend a ship’s lifespan, preventing it from suffering
major damage deep into a battle, thereby allowing
its guns to further damage the enemy. Fleet combat
can be a war of attrition and it is not always the
most powerfully armed fleet but the one that lasts
the longest that prevails. Capital ships with sufficient
screen arrays and experienced gunners have proven
this maxim time and again.

Capital gunners operate bay and spinal mount
weapons. All but small bays employ crews of multiple
gunners that operate in concert to arm, target and fire
their weapons. Bay weapon crews are usually selected
for their ability to cooperate and function well as a
team. Competition between the various bay crews of
a ship is not unheard of, with prizes and awards going
to those who perform the best in drills and battles.
Placing wagers on their targeting prowess is strictly
forbidden by most naval commanders but that does not

prevent it from happening. Officers will often look the
other way provided that morale remains strong and no
awards for ‘worst performance’ are given. Spinal mount
crews are enormous, sometimes including hundreds
of gunners. These crews have their own subcultures
and bureaucracies with a commanding gunnery officer
and ‘trigger person’ at the top of the hierarchy. Spinal
weapon commanding officers are likened to symphony
conductors, who must keep a close eye on every
member of their team, ensuring that they do their jobs
promptly and well. Spinal crews operate complex
machinery with a wide array of parts and functions,
so some degree of specialisation is inevitable but
most have broad cross training. In battle, portions of
a spinal mount crew can become casualties and the
next person up must be prepared to take critical jobs
vacated by fallen comrades.

Bay weapon team leaders are often cross-trained
in Leadership (0 or 1) and Mechanic. Spinal mount
commanding officers are cross-trained in Leadership (1+), Tactics (naval) and Admin, while officers of
a more technical bent receive training in Admin,
Electronics (computers or sensors) and Mechanic.
The more complex the weapon, the more important
the Admin skill becomes. Military capital ships have
budget constraints and every department works hard
to obtain the resources they need from a limited pool.
The gunnery department is no different and having the
Admin skill helps to make sure the maintenance of the
ship’s guns remains a top priority.

Gunners – especially those who operate turrets,
barbettes and small bays – are sometimes a source
of derision due to the mistaken belief that they have
considerable down time. In fact, the best gunners are
constantly working at their craft, analysing past battles
and recordings, and simulations of other battles, not
just famous ones, but routine encounters likely to
resemble what the gunners themselves might one day
face. Screen and capital gunners are not exempt from
such critiques; organised maintenance, training and
drilling is a full-time job for these specialisations.

Gunnery control can be centralised at the bridge or
dispersed throughout a ship. Most capital ships have
dispersed control to prevent a lucky shot by enemy
spacecraft from eliminating a ship’s offensive capabilities.

Even a ‘decapitated’ ship with its bridge destroyed
can still be lethal as long as its guns keep firing. Some
ships have a centralised model with the commander
and key trigger personnel on the bridge. Design
efficiencies and the preferences of the admiralty dictate

Crew Roles



which approach is taken. Captains who came up in
the ranks of the gunnery department usually prefer a
strictly distributed approach while those who came up
in flight, technical or the line often prefer to have their
key gunners in close physical proximity.

THE GUNNER’S CONTROL PANEL
Gunners, especially those on ships with the holographic
display option, benefit from a highly customised control
panel setup. Gunners arrange their preferences,
including a complete array of targets, hit probabilities,
damage estimates for hits they have made and – when
closing in for the kill – a target-assist heads-up display
of potential called shot locations.

The ship’s computer automatically uses the comms
to transmit firing platform suggestions to the pilot but
the exchange can be much more lively than just an
automated feed of data. Once the ship is in dogfight
range, the display goes wild, showing more data than
the typical gunner can handle. Gunners with neural
links might be more accustomed to the rapid flow of
targeting data and dangers that the ship faces during
this phase. However, many veteran gunners eschew
such technology, preferring instead to rely upon
instincts and fast reflexes.

MAINTENANCE


The larger the ship, the more widespread and extensive
its basic systems are. Small ships can run with the aid
of one or two engineers but commercial ships of 1,000
tons or more and military ships of 500 tons or more
require additional personnel to keep everything running
properly. A ship may be viewed as an organism; the
larger the organism, the more complex its systems.
On smaller ships, an engineer with some mechanical
skills can take care of both jobs but on larger ships,
maintenance staff must be on hand to keep all systems
healthy when engineers are otherwise engaged
operating the ship’s core technology – manoeuvre and
jump drives, power plants and life support systems.

Mechanic is the primary skill of maintenance workers
but those with qualifications in the various electronics
specialisations or those with a basic understanding
of engineering have superior value. Maintenance
workers with this level of cross-training are often
called ‘drivehands’ in ship parlance. The title is more
esteemed in some circles and can even be used to
negotiate for a marginally higher salary. Drivehands
are expected to be troubleshooters who can assist the

engineering staff or substitute for them in a pinch. Due
to their more limited expertise, drivehand repairs are
often temporary and might require more permanent
attention by engineers at a later time.

Ship maintenance staff must be creative and know
how to use their skills to ‘jury rig’ a faulty system.
While engineers are busy with the complicated
tasks of keeping the ship’s high-tech drives running,
maintenance workers must replace lighting systems,
clean air ventilation shafts, get sticky iris valves to
open and close properly, and keep the cargo crane
rolling smoothly between the gantries in the hold.
Maintenance is a blue-collar job that pays less, often
calls for more overtime and lacks the glamour and
perceived value that engineers have but quality
maintenance staff are worth their weight in gold.
During space combat, maintenance staff must often
put themselves in harm’s way to get a critical system
back online after it sustains battle damage. Hazard duty
requires some level of expertise with vacc suits.

In addition to ship hardware, maintenance staff
are expected to keep all subordinate craft well
maintained, too. This includes ship’s boats, fighter
craft, air/rafts, ATVs and any other vehicles docked
within the mother ship.

MARINES AND SHIP’S TROOPS
The terms marines and ship’s troops are sometimes
used interchangeably. While the two share some of the
same duties, there are significant differences in scope.

Ship’s troops are exactly that: troops on a ship. The
primary role of the ship’s troop is to defend their ship.
When the ship is docked to another, their duties may
extend to the attached ship, whether they are sent
inside as a security detachment, part of an inspection
or a boarding party.

Marines are often used for the same duties but are also
on hand for standard marine functions such as orbital
drops and raiding. Marines also serve in lift-infantry
units but this requires a special type of ship, usually a
capital ship that is a member of an AssaultRon (assault
squadron). Lift infantry usually include a vehicular
component that requires a capital ship to transport it.

Ship’s troops and marines must perform a significant
amount of training to perform their roles, most of which
is done off-ship. Weapons training requires a firing range
and while ships sometimes have training facilities for this

- simulators or even a designated area in the cargo hold

Crew Roles

- most such training is done offsite. Likewise for small-

unit tactics, which are extremely important. Honing one’s
skills in the arts of defending or assaulting a ship can be
done aboard the ship to which a marine or ship’s troop is
assigned but it creates a significant amount of chaos. It
is difficult for other crew members to get their jobs done
when armed and armoured soldiers are running through
the hallways, simulating breach defence, ship-to-ship
assault and other drills.

When not actively performing their duties, marines and
ship’s troops can be idle, which might cause problems.
For example, during jump, there is little for them to do.
The obvious solution would be to store them in low
berths but due to the dangers and the time it takes to
recover after being revived, this can be impractical.
For this reason, low berth storage is typically reserved
for mercenaries and other soldiers who merely need
transportation from one world to the next. Even then,
the practice is suspect. When one is being transported
for active duty, whether in service to the Imperial Army
or a mercenary unit, it does not pay to be groggy
before being inserted into a potential war zone or other
environment in which alertness is required. Idleness
among ship’s troops and marines is usually remedied
with technical studies and drills that require more
thinking and less action. This does not always go over
well with some of the rough-and-tumble sorts who take
these roles but is attempted nonetheless.

Ship’s troops and marines are usually accommodated
in double-occupancy rooms or a barracks. Each
requires a similar investment in space and life support
costs but a barracks environment can foster a superior
team mentality which, as every soldier knows, adds to
performance and survivability in the field of battle.

If the ship’s troops or marines are members of a
military service and they are serving on a small ship,
such as a close escort or patrol corvette, then they are
typically organised into a light platoon, even if they are
little more than a squad or section in size. A lieutenant
is usually in charge of the unit, although a sergeant
will suffice. As ships and the troop contingents get
larger, they might resemble traditional military units in
organisation with ranks up to and including a brigadier
or general in charge.

For more about ship’s troops and marines and the
kinds of operations they perform, see Boarding Actions
on page 125. Included are recommendations for the
types of weapons and armour used.

MEDIC


The ship’s medic might go by other names, including
medical officer, ship’s doctor or in the case of a navy
ship, naval surgeon.

One medic per 120 crew is required on all ships.
While there is no formal requirement, one medic is
recommended per medical bay, enabling each to
provide care for up to three patients if necessary.

A ship’s medic is on hand to address all the typical
needs of patients: providing medication and treatment
for the sick and wounded, ensuring the physical
and mental well-being of all crew, providing first aid
treatments and operating any medical technology
aboard the ship such as a medical bay or autodoc. If
the ship has low berths, medics are expected to put low
passengers into cryogenic sleep and revive them when
they reach their destinations. Expert medics are adept
at this task but journeyman medics usually perform
revivals slowly to reduce injuries and death.

The medic is also expected to maintain and secure the
supply of any drugs used by the crew. Ideally these are
contained in a secure facility in a medical bay but other
devices are available, enabling drug storage in a ship’s
locker or other storage space.

Travelling medics are likely to see a broad range of
pathogens over the course of their careers, especially
those who travel to uncharted or rarely visited worlds.
While there are extensive catalogues of disease-causing
microbes kept at most major hubs, medics encounter
surprises. Unknown or mutated viruses and bacteria
often thwart vaccines and other treatments, and it
requires advanced medical technology to keep up
with the changes. Microbes are not the only biohazard
encountered on alien worlds. There are many fauna and
flora that can cause health problems as well. Venoms,
acids, spores and vicious bites are sometimes suffered
by Travellers who wander the wild outback of the
frontier. The ship’s medic must be prepared to deal with
such occurrences, not to mention those incurred from
weaponry, high-tech or otherwise. In space travel, there
is also the constant danger of radiation exposure. The
universe can be a dangerous place and the ship’s medic
never knows what sorts of hazards their crew might
encounter and what treatments will be required.

Medics on a military ship might have the opportunity to
go into the field to perform surgery or support military
units during deployments. These can be hazardous
assignments and medics with cross-training in
terrestrial skills such as Navigation, Recon and Survival
are preferred.

Crew Roles



While there is no formal requirement for ships with
fewer than 120 crew and passengers to hire a medic,
having someone on hand with the Medic skill is
recommended. Ships carrying middle passengers
should have at least one crew member with Medic 1+
and if transporting high passengers, there should be
one with Medic 2+.

OFFICER


Whether a ship is civilian or military, the larger its crew,
the more officers are required to manage them and to
take on important projects during its missions.

Commercial ships require one officer per 20 crew and
military ships require one officer for every 10 crew.
Common departments for both civilian and military
ships are command, flight, engineering, small craft
operations and medical, if a ship’s doctor is present.

On a civilian ship, the mission might be commercial,
political, diplomatic or many others. On a merchant
ship, officers are assigned to manage finances and
interstellar economics. A political or diplomatic mission
might have an administrative wing or a security
detachment to protect heads of state or emissaries
on foreign worlds. The possibilities are endless but
the need for a command structure is the same. When
there is a mission to be accomplished, some form of
organisational hierarchy is required and leaders are
required to run it.

Military ships have additional departments that are
not present on a civilian ship: marine or ship’s troops
command, and master-at-arms to name a few. Military
missions typically require a greater degree of precision
and adherence to rules and regulations; hence the
requirement for two times as many officers as on
civilian ships.

On a ship with one or only a few officers, the primary
responsibility of the officer corps is to check in on each
of the departments of the ship, make sure things are
in good working order and to ensure the safety and
well-being of all crew. At a minimum, three officers
are necessary to establish a regular watch at a given
position, stationed at the bridge or patrolling the deck
and reviewing the various departments. Officers report
their findings to the captain and fellow officers or, if all
is well, simply sign off on the schedule, ensuring that all
departments and crew are performing to expectations.

As an officer corps grows, regular watches are
established so that critical departments always have an
officer on hand to manage its systems and crew. At a
minimum, watches should be established on the bridge,
the deck (all accessible compartments and corridors
on the ship) and in the engineering (sometimes called
technical operations) department. As the officer corps
expands with a larger crew, management of the cargo
hold, gunnery (if present), stewards, administration and
any additional departments are incorporated into the
watch schedule. Functions such as bridge, deck and
engineering are expected to have an officer on watch at
all times while some other departments might only have
officers on hand during nominal daytime hours.

On smaller ships, officers might be called upon for
different assignments when their ship is in port but
on larger ships, watches are maintained as normal
unless the ship is secure or additional officers have
been brought aboard from the associated agency (for example: military bases, government agencies or
corporate offices) to help manage the ship.

Officers are typically the most well-informed crew
members on the ship up to and including the captain,
who relies upon the officers to stay updated. When
not on duty, officers review mission objectives and
make sure that they are prepared for whatever events
are to occur after the ship reaches its destination. On
commercial ships, this might be preparing for docking,
trade activities or bringing esteemed guests aboard.
On military ships this can be anything from preparing
to show the flag at a friendly port, to drilling with allied
ships to full battle stations and wartime missions if they
are entering a conflict zone.

PILOT


The pilot of a spacecraft has the glamourous job of
flying the ship in normal space and within planetary
atmospheres if the ship is designed for it. The pilot can
often seem to be the one in command of the ship – they
are flying it, after all – but this need not be the case. On
small ships, the pilot has a lot of say in what happens.
When it comes to making tight manoeuvres, there is
no time to make decisions by committee. On larger
ships, there is a captain making the call but even on the
mightiest capital ship, the pilot must often make split-second decisions that affect the safety and wellbeing
of the entire crew, not to mention the integrity of the
ship itself. Pilot skill is divided into three categories:
small craft, spacecraft and capital ships. Knowledge
of one imparts partial knowledge of the others but the
experience of flying each type of ship is quite different.

Crew Roles

Those with Pilot (small craft) fly ships below 100 tons,
from five-ton light fighters to large passenger shuttles.
While there are clearly differences among small craft,
the principles are similar. Gravitic technology and
g-compensation makes handling them just about the
same. A small fighter has similar performance to a
shuttle in vacuum. One of the key differences for a
small-craft pilot is the ability to fly the ship into and
out of small spaces. Fighters are launched a number
of ways, including simply detaching from a docking
clamp to being fired out of a launch tube. Docking small
craft with other ships or flying them onto a recovery
deck requires a light touch by the pilot. If one were to
liken piloting to painting, larger ships use big, broad
strokes while small craft require minute, delicate ones,
quick flicks of the wrist on the throttle, control wheel or
holographic controls.

Small craft perform far differently in atmosphere than
larger ships. Almost all small craft are streamlined,
making them capable of atmospheric landings. Many
are designed to dock with larger ships and therefore
serve as interface craft to highports and downports,
leaving their mother ships in close orbit. Because of
their small size and configuration, small craft are quite
nimble in atmosphere. The addition of aerofins greatly
aids this performance but most do not use them.

Another aspect of flying small craft, especially fighters
and other armed ships, is that the pilot is often called
upon to serve as the gunner as well. Most armed small
craft have fixed mount weapons on Firmpoints instead
of a turret weapon on a Hardpoint. These weapons
require that pilots adjust their facing before using
the weapon. During combat, such manoeuvres are
assumed to take place during a single combat round
and are incorporated as part of any Pilot and Gunner
checks the pilot makes, although Pilot and Gunner
checks do. Fortunately, most actions taken by pilots
and gunners are in separate steps of the space combat
sequence, making it possible for a pilot-gunner to do
the job alone. The Manoeuvre, Attack and Actions steps
do not share actions by pilot and gunner; however, in
the Reaction step, a pilot-gunner must choose between
evasive action (pilot) and point defence (gunner).

Mid- to large-sized ships with small craft in docking
spaces or hangars usually appoint specialised pilots
for the starship and small craft roles. Not only does this
ensure superior performance in their assigned roles
but it also allows for cross-training should one type of
pilot be required to fill the role of the other. Inter-career
competition between the two specialisations is common
with starship pilots lording it over the ‘subordinate’ small

craft pilots, who in turn denigrate their alleged superiors
by pointing out that flying an ‘oversized brick’ lacks the
skill or panache required of ‘real pilots’ like themselves.
Common parlance refers to starship pilots as ‘space
truckers’ with small craft pilots as ‘flyboys’ (or ‘flygirls’
as the case may be).

Pilot (spacecraft) uses many of the same skills
possessed by small-craft pilots but there are more
things to be concerned about. While it might take a light
touch to fly a shuttle, dexterity is valuable to starship
pilots as well. Most small craft are used as interface
vehicles and do not have accommodations for long,
in-system flights. This task falls upon starships which,
in addition to flying to and from jump point, must also
travel between the various planetary bodies of a
system when required. While large and capital ships
often use shuttles to skim for fuel from gas giants, the
vast majority of wilderness refuelling is performed by
starships. Skimming for fuel is a potentially hazardous
task, one which subpar pilots should avoid.

A starship is more than just a hull fitted with manoeuvre
drives and a small power plant. Starships almost
invariably have an assigned role whether they be
traders, scouts, yachts, escorts, corvettes or other
types of ship. As such, they carry components
particular to their assigned role. Traders and even more
so subsidised merchants are sometimes disparaged as
‘spaceborne storage closets’, which does their pilots
little justice. Such ships minimise drive size in order to
maximise cargo space, giving the pilot little to work with
should greater range or power be required. Their pilots
must make do with what they have, requiring creativity
and savvy.

While not all starships are streamlined, and therefore
designed to enter atmosphere, some are and doing
so is a far greater challenge than for small craft. Even
streamlined starships face the challenge of their
greater girth and heft when performing manoeuvres
and landings, especially on worlds with high gravity
and thin atmospheres. The challenge of knowing
where every compartment, turret, wing, fin and nacelle
juts out of the ship requires greater forethought when
performing complex manoeuvres and landings. Landing
partially streamlined ships is even more difficult and not
recommended for the journeyman pilot.

Virtually all starships in the Charted Space universe
use manoeuvre drives, whose primary components are
thruster plates and g-compensators. The first provide
reactionless thrust and the second nullify its effects
on crew and passengers contained within the hull.
Some ships have auxiliary reaction drives, used either

Crew Roles



as a backup or to support the manoeuvre drive with
added thrust on the cheap. Using these on a starship
requires careful consideration by the pilot, especially
when civilian passengers are aboard. Most spacers are
not accustomed to dealing with g-forces, having been
spoiled by g-compensation for the vast majority of their
time under thrust. All pilots, however, have been taught
how to handle the effects of high-g as part of their
training. G-compensation might be taken for granted
but one cannot obtain certification as a pilot without
being taught how to operate without it. Unlike a small-craft pilot, the pilot of a starship is more often tasked
with the conveyance of an entire crew and passengers.
Moving the ship means moving everyone and this is
never far from the pilot’s mind.

When in jumpspace, there is little for pilots to do.
This gives them an opportunity to relax, brush up on
their skills in simulations and work on cross-training
skills. Before coming out of jump, most pilots do their
homework in preparation for their new location. Coming
out of jump is not unlike an extended teleportation.
While one expects to emerge 100 diameters from any
planetary bodies, there are a great many variables to be
prepared for. In the Imperium, the space between worlds
is patrolled by the Imperial Navy and subject to Imperial
law. Individual planets have their own laws and customs.
The ship’s pilot should be prepared for the differences.

More than any other role aboard ship, the pilot is a
nexus for interaction with other crew positions. The pilot
puts the ship in position for the astrogator’s jump plot,
relies upon the ship’s engineer to keep the drives and
power plant in good working order, positions the ship to
establish an optimal firing platform for the gunners and
works closely with the sensor operator to collect data
about their surroundings. While a ship’s captain may
be likened to a conductor, the pilot plays the central
instrument of the orchestra.

If flying a starship can be considered complex,
then piloting a capital ship is on an entirely different
level. The Pilot (capital ships) skill is reserved for
pilots of the largest ships in Charted Space, ranging
from 5,000 tons to gargantuan dreadnoughts and
megafreighters in the multi-100,000-ton range. Thruster
and g-compensation technology make manoeuvring
such ships only a shade different than much smaller
ships but their sheer size and breadth require careful
consideration for every move they make.

Moving a capital ship is like moving a small mountain.
Capital ship pilots have a greater understanding of
the limits of thruster plates than those who fly smaller
ships. While fully functioning thruster plates provide
maximum thrust in one direction, pilots can get
approximately 25% thrust capacity in lateral directions
and 10% in reverse. Pilots of smaller ships rely upon
these aspects of thruster technology only for finesse
manoeuvres but the capital ship pilot lives by them.
Directional adjustments and turnaround manoeuvres
are much smoother when the pilot applies lateral thrust
during the transition.

Another aspect of capital ship piloting that often
goes unheralded is the need for greater situational
awareness. When in normal space, capital ships are
often a nexus of activity, with numerous small craft
and starships flying in close proximity. The launching
of shuttles, fighters and other small craft added to
visiting spacecraft from the local starport or other ships
in the fleet make the capital ship a veritable beehive
of activity. The pilot must be acutely aware of every
ship and other object in their vicinity lest there be an
accident. Capital ships are akin to giants who must take
caution lest they crush the smaller beings around them.

Capital ships are rarely streamlined and therefore not
designed to enter atmospheres. As such, The primary
objective of the capital-ship pilot is to get the enormous
spacecraft into position for its duties, whether that be
launching cargo or fuel shuttles, or assembling into
formation with a naval squadron. Naval manoeuvres
are covered in more detail in Element Class Cruisers
and The Third Imperium but suffice it to say that each
type of naval capital ship, whether it be a cruiser, fleet
carrier, assault carrier, battleship, dreadnought or any
of the other classes, each has specific and general
roles to fill that require unique training.

In combat, the capital ship pilot’s job is to provide
firing platforms for the gunners. A ship’s weapons are
distributed along multiple sides of its hull (starboard,
port, dorsal, ventral, fore and aft), so this requires
movement by the ship to face all guns upon a desired
target over a brief interval (one combat round). If there
is a single target, the pilot applies lateral thrust, first
displaying one face, firing, then displaying each of the
others and allowing for the weapons to fire after each
shift. If the ship is armed with a spinal mount, it may fire
this weapon at any time during its facing adjustments
but must pause to target it beforehand. Should the
capital ship be in battle with multiple targets, hence

Crew Roles

delivering fire in three dimensions against several
opponents, the facing adjustments can be even more
complex, requiring greater skill and finesse by the pilot.

**THE PILOT’S CONTROL PANEL**
Pilot control panels vary from ship-to-ship. At the lower
end, flight control systems are completely mechanical,
including a hands-on throttle-and-stick that enables the
pilot to pitch, yaw and roll the ship. Configurable buttons
on the stick enable the pilot to lock the current motion
of the spacecraft, return it to default (straight forward)
and an abort button that returns to the last setting.
Holographic controls feature the same instruments but
are tailored to the individual pilot. For example, some
pilots do not use a holographic joystick but instead some
other virtual tool to manoeuvre the ship.

Video or holographic displays vary from ship-to-ship. Some pilots only run a few screens to prevent
from having too many distractions but the standard
displays that every pilot uses includes a feed from
the astrogation computer, a sensor array display that
provides a survey of near-space objects along, drive
and power plant status and the current thrust being
applied by the ship. Busier panels feature graphical
elements that display distance to jump point, current
power usage, hull integrity, a fuel gauge, weapon
optimisation options and 3D maps to key destinations
such as a highport or downport.

Most pilots have customised displays for various
scenarios with separate jump point transit, in-system
travel, space combat and docking configurations at the
ready. On ships with holographic controls, the pilot can
sweep from one to the next with the wave of a hand.

Capital ship pilots have an immensely more
complicated set of displays that they must prioritise.
A fleet monitor display keeps track of their position
both within a squadron and in the fleet to which the
squadron is assigned.

During a fleet battle, this becomes of great importance
if losses begin to pile up. A ship that remains intact after
several of their squadron are disabled or destroyed,
may be reassigned. The pilot uses the fleet monitor to
acquire their newly assigned ‘battle squadron’, to which
they must then relocate and join per the fleet admiral’s
orders. These manoeuvres can be fraught with danger
and call upon the pilot’s skill and situational awareness.
There are many moving parts to a fleet in battle and
deftly inserting one’s ship into a new element requires
skill and flexibility as the pilot makes a balletic entry into
a new squadron or fleet, possibly amid a raging battle.

In combat, the facing display becomes of paramount
importance, as the pilot adjusts the ship’s facing
multiple times to ensure that all gunners are given an
opportunity to fire. The display can be thought of as
a game console of sorts, in which the pilot’s job is to
ensure that gunners in every facing have an opportunity
to fire over a given interval.

SENSOR OPERATOR (SENSOP)
The sensor operator, or ‘sensop’, position is extremely
important, especially on ships that require accurate
information about what – and who – is in space
around them. Ships that travel into dangerous
systems where there are pirates or enemy warships
need their sensors to give them detailed information
about their environments.

On a small ship, the sensop role is sometimes
assigned to an individual but may also be a part-time
duty executed by one or more members of the crew.
Should the ship find itself in combat, a dedicated
sensop is recommended. There are too many tasks for
it to be a part-time job when one’s ship is being fired
upon. The first of these tasks, unfortunately, can occur
before the crew of a ship even knows that the sensop
was needed.

Crew Roles



Enemy ships can gain surprise on an unwitting ship
that does not have an assigned sensop dutifully
minding their station. When a ship comes out of jump,
approaches a starport, world or gas giant with the
intention of skimming for fuel, there are a great many
unknowns. Depending on the quality of the sensor
array, a ship’s passive sensors should paint a picture
of its surroundings, depicting planets, planetoids, large
heat- or radiation-emitting objects and any ships with
their transponders on or those using active sensors.
However, ships actively maintaining a low profile –
stealthed ships or those running on low power and
using only passive sensors – might not be detected
unless the sensop is actively looking for them. Under
the right circumstances, a ship can gain surprise on an
opponent and fire upon them before their presence has
even been detected.

Cautious use of available sensors can be played out
as a game of ‘cat and mouse’ where powered-down
ships skulk about, virtually undetected until they reveal
themselves with a tell-tale sign: use of active sensors,
transponder, manoeuvre drives or firing a weapon, just
to name a few.

Once the battle has been joined, the sensop’s role
expands, especially against difficult-to-detect ships. If
a sensop makes a successful Average (8+) Electronics (sensors) check, adjusted by Tech Level and other
DMs, the profile and approximate location of an
opposing ship is maintained throughout combat with a
few exceptions. Sensory contact with ships that have
emissions absorption grids or stealth coatings can be
lost whenever they manoeuvre into a new range band.
For example, if a stealth ship is detected, but it uses its
superior thrust to travel from Short to Medium range,
the sensop on the opposing ship must reobtain the
ship’s sensory signature.

During combat, the sensop may also obtain sensor
locks (making the opposing ship easier to hit with
weapons), engage in electronic warfare to jam enemy
communications or break jams that have been imposed
on one’s comms system. Electronic warfare can also
be used to prematurely detonate or misdirect incoming
missile salvos. The sensop sometimes faces hard
choices when only one of the above activities can be
conducted during specific phases of combat. Having
multiple sensor stations or a capital ship bridge
remedies this but even the most grandiose bridge has
its sensory limitations.

Under more peaceful circumstances, a sensop might
be employed with the task of examining sensor data
to gain more information about near-space objects.
Detailed scans of rogue planetoids or comets,
salvageable ships or abandoned space stations can
give the crew of a ship critical information before they
approach. Refer to page 160 of the Traveller Core
Rulebook for detailed information about what each
sensor array has in its arsenal and the range and
accuracy of its instruments. Most ships have only
Civilian or Military Grade sensors, limiting them to
lidar, radar and possibly jammers but Improved and
Advanced sensor arrays include technology such as
densitometers and neural activity sensors, which can
greatly enhance the data. A good sensop can give a
group of Travellers a great deal of information about
what – or even who – is present on an asteroid they
want to mine for precious ores or an old wreck they
want to salvage.

STEWARD


A ship’s steward is responsible for the care and feeding
of its crew and passengers, and the cleaning and
maintenance of their accommodations.

On a typical merchant spacecraft, the steward must
divide their time to appropriately service passengers
of various levels. High passage is the equivalent
of a luxury cruise or flight in first class, including
a comfortable, well-appointed and meticulously
maintained stateroom – potentially of the high or luxury
designation, if available – with single occupancy, high-quality and delicious food provided in three square
meals and staff present to wait on hand and foot. High
passengers also lease one ton of cargo space in the
ship’s hold. One level of Steward is required per 10
high passengers.

Middle passage is standard class. Middle passengers
enjoy single-occupancy staterooms but the décor and
maintenance is more pedestrian and room service
might be provided on a bi-daily or less frequent
schedule. Perhaps a single meal is provided per day
with other meals available via self-service. Middle
passengers lease 100 kilograms of cargo space. One
level of Steward is required per 100 middle passengers.

Basic passage varies in quality. At best, passengers
can expect double occupancy in a stateroom with
minimal attention from the ship’s steward. Limited
access to stores is granted but passengers at this
level are expected to provide for themselves. If

Crew Roles

possible, basic passengers are segregated from high
and middle passengers. In cases where space is not
available in the accommodations, basic passengers
may be assigned a cot in the cargo hold or another
available space. Basic passengers are allotted 10
kilograms of space.

Low passage entails being frozen in a cryogenic low
berth, which occasionally results in the injury, illness
or death of the passenger. Low passengers receive 10
kilograms of cargo space and receive little attention
from the steward other than an occasional check-in or
response to an automated alert. Stewards with Medic
skill might be called upon to place low passengers in
their low berths and revive them at the end of their
journey, but this responsibility goes to the ship’s medic
if one is present.

On a passenger-carrying starship, the steward is the
busiest member of the crew during jump. While many
crew members have little to do during this time, the
steward is actively caring for and engaging with the
passengers. Stewards with additional skills, such as
Art (performer or instrument), Carouse and Diplomat
may be called upon to entertain high and middle
passengers, enhancing their experience and garnering
a good reputation for the ship. Stewards with Medic or
Science (psychology) can provide medical care or even
therapy for passengers if requested.

For many passengers, the steward is their sole
point of contact among the crew. Most trader ships
have dedicated passenger sections to ensure the
security of the ship and passengers are rarely allowed
to wander outside of their assigned boundaries.
However, jumps are a week long and some voyages
require multiple jumps. The long period of time
sequestered aboard a ship can make passengers a
bit stir crazy after a while, giving them symptoms of
‘space fatigue’. Tours of the ship and chances to meet
the captain and crew can serve as a welcome remedy
for the monotony of space travel.

As the old saying goes, one must spend money to
make money. Stewards proud of their ship’s reputation
often spend time at ports of call seeking quality
ingredients for cuisine and wine and spirits for their
passengers. Such a high degree of care and concern
rarely goes unnoticed by passengers, who will highly
rate the ship, its steward and by extension its crew,
giving the ship a superior reputation and enhancing its
ability to find passengers in the future. For stewards
who spend Cr1000 or more per high passenger, give
the ship’s purser DM+1 when seeking passengers as
described in the Traveller Core Rulebook. Also consider
that stewards who go to such great lengths often collect
generous tips from their high and middle passengers.

# C REATING DECK PLANS

Traveller has a long and proud history of not only
bringing ships of every shape and description into
galaxies beyond counting but also providing deck
plans. Deck plans work on so many levels, from simply
allowing Travellers to visualise where everything in a
ship is likely to be (and provide endless arguments over
who gets which stateroom!), to being used as a tactical
map during boarding actions where every bulkhead
and iris valve can become an important objective as
ruthless invaders forge their way into the most vital
areas of a ship.

In short, whenever you design a new ship in High Guard,
it is always worth creating a deck plan to go with it.

Designing a deck plan can seem a daunting task at
first, as if it were some sort of secret knowledge passed
on only between clans of highly specialised naval archi-tects. However, as this chapter demonstrates, it is noth-ing of the sort and even the most artistically challenged,
armed with nothing but graph paper and a pencil, can
quickly produce convincing deck plans suitable for play.

VITAL POINTS TO REMEMBER



- All components that consume tonnage should be
  represented on the deck plan with the exception of
  Armour, Reinforced Bulkheads and Hull.
- Remember that ships can have more than one deck.
- Ships with more than one deck require access
  to each deck, either through hatches in the floor/
  ceiling or lifts.
- If a deck or other large area of a ship contains
  nothing but fuel, there is usually no need to put it
  on the deck plan. However, you must remember it
  is there when sketching out the exterior of the ship.

AND BEAR IN MIND...

- Ammunition storage should be located near its
  weapon system. After all, when that forward
  torpedo bay runs out of ammunition, do you really
  want to run back to the rear ammunition store and
  somehow lug a two-and-a-half-ton torpedo up to
  the front of the ship before you can fire again?
- Anything that needs access to the outside (airlocks,
  vessels carried on board, escape pods, re-entry
  capsules, launch tubes, recovery hangars, probe
  drones and so forth) can gain that access from
  above or below, not just the side.
- Screens could be considered to be integrated
  throughout the hull and not appear on the deck
  plan or, alternatively, they may be located in one
  centralised area.
- Common areas vary, depending on the ship and its
  role but a ratio of perhaps one square for every two
  staterooms is a good start.
- Not all the tonnage allocated to a stateroom
  necessarily goes to the stateroom itself; some can
  be used for corridors and similar spaces.
- Staterooms contain freshers but you may want to
  locate some additional ones in different areas of
  the ship, including as part of common areas.
- Try to minimise excess corridor space as much as
  you can. Ship architects are going to squeeze as
  much space as possible into other areas such as
  cargo. If the ship has space enough to have, say, a
  single corridor that only leads to a fresher, that space
  can be better utilised elsewhere (such as cargo).
- Take advantage of the options available in digital
  tools if you are using any, such as Grid (used
  to help determine the size of areas), Snap and
  Alignment (can help with the placement of items),
  Copy/ Paste or Symbol Libraries (handy for
  common items such as drives, staterooms and
  so forth) and Replication/Duplication (for quickly
  placing multiples of an item).

STEP 1

STEP 3

STEP 5

CREATING A DECK PLAN


So, now we will go through a step-by-step guide on
how to construct a deck plan. We are going to put
together a 200-ton far trader.

**STEP ONE**
Sketch a general impression of the exterior shape of
the ship. This will give you an idea for the design of the
interior deck plan.

**STEP TWO**
Check the overall tonnage of the ship. Each ton is
usually represented by two squares on a deck plan (very large ships may use a different scale to produce
deck plans that will fit on a page). You can vary this
by up to +/- 10% as spacecraft differ in the amount of
space consumed by corridors, lifts, computer systems,
life support, machinery and other items not included in
the overall design system.

STEP THREE


Note that the tonnage of the components dictates how
many squares are needed on the deck plan. Start with
the power plant, jump drive and manoeuvre drive; each
ton on all components requires two squares on the
deck plan (so one square equals a half ton).

STEP FOUR


Staterooms typically use six squares, despite them
being four tons each – it is assumed that the extra
tonnage goes into corridors and access areas.

STEP FIVE


Once you have located all the components that
consume tonnage on the deck plan, you are ready to
go! It helps if you label each component, especially if
you have not used symbols to represent them. Now
you are ready to take to the space lanes and use your
deck plan in its first boarding action!

Creating Deck plans

# F IGHTERS

The popular image of the space fighter pilot is of a
maverick, care-free hotshot, who bucks authority
to complete the mission. The reality is altogether
more professional and while the real strength of any
interstellar navy rests on its cruisers and battleships,
fighter squadrons are an important supporting element
for any fleet.

This chapter presents rules that allow a Referee to
bring fighters to the fore of a campaign, extending
both the capabilities of fleets and the role of the fighter
pilot in adventures.

For the purposes of these rules, a fighter is generally
considered to be an armed small craft of no more than
50 tons and at least Thrust 5. However, the Referee
might find it useful to extend this definition to cover
additional craft. For example, a ‘torpedo boat’ might
be a 95-ton, Thrust 4 spacecraft but still have a place
within the fighter family.

SQUADRONS


Fighters rarely travel alone and are commonly flown in
pairs (a lead and a wingman) for mutual protection and
support. In larger conflicts, these pairs are combined
into larger groups – officially, these might be called
sections, flights, squadrons or wings but, for the
purposes of Traveller, the term squadron is used for
any cohesive group of fighters.

Fighter squadrons can be organised into groups to
lighten the burden on a Referee during a game, treating
several fighters as a single unit for the purposes of
movement and attacks – in effect, a squadron is treated
in the same way as a single ship and may use the Ship
Record Sheet found on page 106.

A squadron can be created from any number of fighters
that are within Adjacent or Close range of each other (about 10 kilometres), are all able to communicate with
one another and, of course, willing to co-operate and
be led towards a common goal.

Note that individual fighters can join or leave the
squadron at any time, although this forces the Referee
or Travellers to recalculate the capabilities of the
squadron as shown below.

Also, be aware that these squadron rules are intended
for use with a maximum of perhaps 12 fighters. For
larger fighter squadrons or complete fighter wings, see
Fleet Battles on Page 105.

HULL POINTS


Total the Hull points for every fighter in the squadron

- this becomes the total Hull score for the entire

squadron. However, while large ships can absorb some
damage before suffering adverse effects, fighters are
a lot more fragile, typically built for performance rather
than durability. The Referee should divide the total
Hull points by the number of fighters in the squadron.
Every time the squadron loses this many Hull points,
a random fighter within the squadron is destroyed.
A squadron also loses a random fighter every time it
suffers a critical hit – there is no need to roll for the
effects of the critical hit, simply remove a fighter.

PERFORMANCE


While most squadrons will be comprised of the same
model of fighter, there is no reason why this need be
the case. Indeed, there are stirring tales of ragged
bands of rebels gathering every high-performance
small craft they can find to form ad hoc squadrons to
fight a larger aggressor and even fully-equipped navies
might find it beneficial to form mixed squadrons to
achieve specific tasks.

In terms of Tech Level, Armour, Thrust, software and
skill levels, the squadron operates at the level of the
worst performing fighter within it. So, for example, if you
have a squadron of high-performance Thrust 9 space
superiority fighters that are joined by a Thrust 6 missile
fighter, the whole squadron is limited to Thrust 6.
However, in terms of sensors, always use the highest
quality (taking into account both actual sensors and the
skill of the operator) within the squadron.

COMBAT


Every fighter in the squadron must perform the same
pilot action every round. However, if the fighters have
additional crew members, they can use separate
actions, in the same way as crew on board a ship can.

All weapons of the same type within a squadron make
a single attack roll, gaining DM+1 to the attack roll for
every fighter after the first in the squadron. Resolve

damage as you would for a missile salvo, rolling once
for damage, applying any armour and screens, and
then multiplying by the effect.

**Note:** The Referee can allow squadrons to split
their attacks between different targets within range,
reducing the bonuses accordingly for each attack.
However, be aware that this greatly increases the
workload and is not recommended for anything other
than special circumstances.

DOGFIGHTING


When two or more squadrons meet in space, battle can
quickly devolve into a swirling swarm of hornets that
relies on equal parts technology, reactions, situational
awareness and luck.

Squadrons use the dogfighting rules detailed on page
173 of the Traveller Core Rulebook as normal, treating
the entire squadron as a single ship. However, do not
total the tonnage of the fighters within the squadron
when applying modifiers to the dogfighting roll. Instead,
use the average tonnage of the fighters within the
squadron (this does not apply unless the Referee
allows the use of fighters that are 50 tons and above).

Squadrons can engage in dogfights with much larger
ships as normal, using their small size and large
numbers to evade attacks and deliver devastating
strikes against their lumbering enemy.

A dogfight starts as soon as a craft ends its manoeuvre
step within Close or Adjacent range of an enemy and
ends when a craft moves beyond close range.

FIRING INTO DOGFIGHTS


Dogfights can rapidly devolve into massive furballs
compacted into tiny areas of space, a nightmare for
the pilots involved and a tense situation for craft further
away who are attempting to attack targets within.
Picking out individual targets without accidentally hitting
a fast-moving friendly craft can be extremely difficult.

Ships not involved in a dogfight can attempt to attack
targets that are engaged within it but do so with DM-4
to their attack rolls.

If the Referee permits it, such attacks can be attempted
without this penalty but before the attack roll is made,
roll 1D. If the result is even, the attacker selects the
target as normal. If the result is odd, then the defender
can select any craft involved in the dogfight to be the
target, even if it is friendly to the attacker!

Needless to say, employing this kind of free-fire tactic is
not standard Imperial Navy policy.

POINT DEFENCE


While the common perception of a fighter is as an
attack platform or a ‘barrier’ to incoming enemies, they
are often employed in a defensive role when missiles
are flying through space, providing another layer of
point defence for a fleet.

Any fighter or squadron equipped with pulse or beam
lasers may use the point defence action (see page
171 of the Traveller Core Rulebook) to defend either
themselves or any ship being attacked by missiles that
is within Adjacent or Close range.

If the Referee deems a fighter or squadron to be
suitably placed and they have a Thrust score higher
than that of the missile salvo, fighters may perform the
point defence action against any missile salvo while it is
travelling to the target – this can be many thousands of
kilometres away from the salvo’s target.

Because space is very large, the chances of a fighter
being in the right place to intercept fast-moving
missiles is slim unless the salvo was expected before
it was launched. The Referee may insist on Travellers
announcing that they are ordering their fighters to
position themselves between fighting ships specifically
to intercept missiles or they may be allowed to break off
an attack on an enemy ship to intercept missiles it has
just launched.

RECOVERY


Fighter pilots tend to be well-trained in the recovery
of their craft on board a mother ship under simulated
combat conditions. Merely docking with the vessel
is a simple enough task for a skilled pilot but wing
commanders often insist the pilot docks at high velocity,
as may be required when the carrier needs to depart a
combat zone quickly.

On carriers equipped with a recovery deck, a fighter
may safely dock with a Routine (6+) Pilot check (1D
minutes, DEX), provided that they are within Short
range of the carrier at the beginning of the attempt.

DM-1 is applied to this check for every point of Thrust
expended by the fighter or the carrier in the round in
which it is recovered. This is commonly done when
the fighters come in ‘hot’ from combat and need to be
recovered quickly or when the carrier itself is forced to
take evasive manoeuvres.

In addition, a further DM-1 is applied to the check for
every additional fighter that attempts to land in the same
round, unless they are all part of the same squadron.

Failure results in 1D damage to both fighter and carrier,
multiplied by the sum of the Thrust expended by the
fighter and carrier; any armour possessed by either
does not reduce this damage. Recovery decks are
internal to ships and so are not properly armoured and
the armour mounted on fighters is designed to protect it
from incoming fire, not clumsy flying.

# F LEET BATTLES

Most space combat encounters involve just a handful
of ships. For small battles like these, the space combat
rules presented in the Traveller Core Rulebook will
suffice, no matter the tonnage of the ships involved,
whether they be a group of adventure-class ships (2,400 tons or less for each ship) or capital ships in the
multi-100,000-ton range. However, actions featuring a
dozen or more ships can be cumbersome to resolve.
The rules presented here provide an alternative method
to determine the outcome of such battles.

Starship fleet battles are a mainstay of military
science fiction and there are multiple ways for a
Referee to resolve them. Even with the reduced
complexity of the fleet combat system presented
here, going through the steps of a battle takes time,
so the Referee should consider how to run it before
a game session begins. If the Travellers want to
take part, fleet combat can be performed during
game time with the actions of the ships involved
determined by the Referee and Travellers. However,
if the Travellers have less interest in going through
fleet combat step-by-step, the Referee can run the
battle ahead of time, recording the events of each
round so they can be conveyed to the Travellers as
events transpire. Should the Travellers’ actions alter
the course of events, simply adjust the results; a
pre-set fleet combat game need not be a railroad that
the Travellers are forced to ride. Use the generated
events as a guide, altering them as necessary.

Alternatively, the final outcome of a fleet battle may
be determined by the Referee ahead of time and the
Travellers simply play their part. If this is the desired
approach, the standard space combat rules may
be used for the Travellers, focusing only on their
ship and those closely associated with it, including
whichever enemy vessels are to take part in the
more limited encounter. The outcome of the larger
fleet battle happening around them may simply be
predetermined by the Referee or resolved using the
rules in this chapter.

FLEET CREWS


Fleet combat is quite different to space combat in that
it deals with potentially dozens of ships instead of just
a few. In space combat, the heroic actions of a single
starship crew can be divided by role but fleet combat,
by definition, covers the actions of a score or more
ships crewed by hundreds or thousands of individuals.
If the Travellers are the crew of a capital ship in a
naval campaign, they may be in command of the
fleet, squadron or task force featured in the scenario.
In a naval campaign, the Travellers are usually the
commanding officers of a capital ship: the captain,
executive officer, chief pilot, chief engineering officer,
gunnery officer and so on.

To command a fleet, a capital ship must have a
command bridge, As described under Install Bridge, on
page 19. If the Travellers are the officers of the fleet’s
flagship, then making a fleet combat session engaging
might be as simple as allowing them to devise a
strategy and execute the plan as a group, deferring
to their captain for the final word. Alternatively, they
may divide the fleet into squadrons or individual ships
and conduct the actions of their respective portions of
the fleet. Even if the Travellers are not in command,
allowing them to execute the actions of the ships
should provide the desired entertainment.

FLEET SHEET AND FLEET SHIP SHEET


Before conducting a fleet battle, the Referee and
Travellers must prepare a Fleet Sheet for each side
of the battle and Fleet Ship Sheets for every ship
involved. This should only take a few minutes per ship,
as described in Fleet Evaluation on page 110.

For convenience, a Fleet Sheet and two Fleet Ship
Sheets are provided. For the Fleet Ship Sheets, the
first is a sample, filled out in preparation for a fleet
combat session and the second is a blank sheet that
may be reproduced. In addition, a blank Squadron
Sheet is provided to record fighters allocated to battle
squadrons during a fleet combat engagement.

Enter the fleet name and select a flagship. Enter a squadron name for each squadron and then list its front-line fighting ships belowFLEET SHEET

FLEET EVALUATION


To determine the outcome of a fleet battle, there must
be an evaluation of the forces involved. This includes a
description of each fleet and a summary of each ship’s
key offensive and defensive capabilities. Use a Fleet
Sheet to list all the ships of both fleets, and a Fleet
Ship Sheet to record information for each ship involved
in the battle. Note that fighter squadrons are recorded
on a separate Fighter Squadron Sheet, which is also
provided. Copies of the Fleet Sheet, Fleet Ship Sheet
and Fighter Squadron Sheet can all be downloaded
from the Mongoose Publishing website.

To help illustrate how to use the Fleet Ship Sheet, the
Pantheress, a Tigress-class dreadnought, has been
used as an example.

Ship Name and Class
This is the name and type of ship. The ship in the
example is named the Pantheress and its class is
Tigress-class Dreadnought.

Crew Skill
The average skill level of the crew across all duties
and positions. For the sake of simplicity, Referees
can assume a skill level of 0 or 1 represents a green
or inexperienced crew, skill level 2 represents trained
or experienced crew, while skill level 3 is suitable for
veterans. Skill levels of 4 or higher should be extremely
rare – while it is certainly possible for individuals to be
this highly skilled, finding enough exceptional people to
crew a ship is extremely difficult.

Offensive DM
This score represents the overall offensive capabilities
of the ship. Separate DMs are recorded for standard
and missile weapons.

Standard weapons include all turrets, barbettes, bays
and spinal mounts. The standard Offensive DM is
calculated as follows:
•	 Start with half the Crew Skill score of the ship
rounded up.
•	 Add the rating of any Fire Control or Advanced Fire
•	 Control software.
•	 Add +1 if the ship is TL12–14, and +2 if it is TL15.

Missiles weapons include both missiles and torpedoes.
The missile Offensive DM is recorded as follows:

- Add the rating of any Launch Solution software.
- Add +1 if the ship is TL12–14, and +2 if it is TL15.

Fleet Battles

List the two Offensive DMs, separated by a slash. For
example, the Pantheress has a Crew Skill score of 1,
Advanced Fire Control/3 software and the ship is TL15
for a total standard Offensive DM of 6. For the missile
Offensive DM, the Pantheress has Launch Solution/3
software and once again applies a +2 for being TL15,
which adds up to a total missile DM of 5. Therefore, the
Offensive DM for the Pantheress is recorded as 6/5.

Traits
See the table next page for the various Traits that a
ship might have.

Squadrons
List fighter squadrons, if available. Specify the number
of fighters, their weapons, damage value for each
weapon type and the deployment rate. The deployment
rate is the number of launch tubes x 10.

INCORPORATING THE NAVAL


CAMPAIGN SOURCEBOOK


For a more advanced approach to the Crew Skill
level, refer to the Naval Campaign Sourcebook
from the Element Class Cruisers boxed set. Naval
campaigns use the Crew Effectiveness Index (CEI) to determine the abilities and effectiveness
of a ship crew. The index takes into account a
more complex evaluation of the crew’s skill levels
and provides a Task DM for various CEI levels.
Also taken into consideration is the ship’s recent
performance and readiness.

The CEI is used to calculate the Effective CEI (ECEI), a measure of the ship’s current readiness
and experience. A ship that is fresh from the fight
and victorious in recent battles will have a higher
rating, which enhances its Task DM. Likewise,
a ship that has not been put to the test recently,
perhaps due to a green crew or one that has
recently encountered setbacks or losses in battle,
will have a lower ECEI and therefore a lower DM.
The naval campaign rules may also be used to
determine Morale, which plays a significant factor
in fleet combat. See the section on Morale on
page 122.

Fleet Battles

Thrust and Jump
These are the available Thrust and maximum jump
scores.

Armour
Divide the ship’s Armour by 3.5, rounding up. For
example, the Tigress-class dreadnought has Armour

17. Divide that value by 3.5 and round up for a fleet

combat Armour 5.

Defensive DM
This is an overall score that represents several different
factors involved in the defensive capabilities of the ship.
It is calculated as follows:
•	 Start with half the Crew Skill score of the ship
rounded up.
•	 Add the rating of any Evade software.
•	 Add +1 if the ship is TL12–14, and +2 if it is TL15.

For example, the Pantheress has a Crew Skill score
of 1. Half of that score rounded up is 1. The ship has
Evade/3 software, adding 3 to the score, and it is TL15,
adding an additional 2. Adding these values together,
we have a total Defensive DM of 6.

Auto-Repair
The rating of the ship’s Auto-Repair software, if any.

Adjusted Hull Points
As with the normal space combat rules, the fleet
combat system uses Hull points to track the damage
sustained by vessels and when these are reduced to
zero, the ship is wrecked, becomes totally inoperable
and it cannot be repaired in the field. The ship may
be recovered and towed to a shipyard for extensive
repairs but for the purposes of fleet combat, it is no
longer functional.

Trait Requirement Effect
Antirad Radiation Shielding The ship ignores all Radiation damage except from meson weapons.
Black Globe Black Globe Generator The ship can reduce 20–80% of all incoming damage every
round, at a proportional cost of DM-1 to -4 to its own attack rolls
and Thrust. If the amount of damage reduced in a single round is
greater than its maximum capacitor value divided by 100, the ship
is immediately destroyed.
Fleet Defence Point Defence software The ship may share its Salvo Defence score with one other ship
within Close range.
Hardened At least 75% of systems that
use Power are Hardened

The ship ignores all damage from ion weapons.

Reflec Reflec Armour Increase Armour against turret weapons by +10%, rounding up.

Hull points can be found on each ship’s stat sheet.
For example, the Tigress-class dreadnought
has Hull 366,666. "Divide the Hull Points by 3.5,
rounding up. Therefore, the Tigress fleet combat
hull points would be 104,762

Critical Hit Thresholds
Ships incur a critical hit after each 10% of their Hull
points are eliminated. Calculate each 10% increment
and list them in this column. Having these figures ready
makes it easier to determine when critical hits have
occurred as a ship incurs battle damage.

Weapons
There are three fields for weapons: the weapon listing
itself, range and damage. List the weapon type and
the number of them installed on the ship. Range is the
maximum range of the weapon. Damage and Damage
Multiples are obtained from the table on page 112.

For turrets, count each weapon. So, 100 triple beam
laser turrets is counted as 300 beam lasers. Missile
and torpedo weapons are covered on page 36.

ORTILLERY AND ION


Ortillery and ion weapons are not listed in the
Fleet Combat Weapons table. Weapons with the
Orbital Strike and Orbital Bombardment traits are
expected to be used specifically as ortillery and
not typically employed during fleet combat against
other ships. Ion weapons do not inflict damage
but affect the performance of opposing ships as
described in the separate Ion Weapons table.

5 Reduce Thrust by 5 or

6 Reduce Thrust by 6 or

MISSILE AND TORPEDO SALVOES


Missiles and torpedoes attack in salvoes, much as
they do in space combat. Missiles and torpedoes
have a Damage value just like other weapon systems.
However, they do not have Damage Multiples. Instead,
the number of missiles or torpedoes that make it
through a ship’s defences becomes the multiple.

Ion Weapons
Weapon Effect per Weapon
Ion Barbette 75
Small Ion Bay 200
Medium Ion Bay 500
Large Ion Bay 3,500

For Ion weapons, multiply the Effect per Weapon figure
by the number of like weapons used to obtain the total
ion weapon effect. This number is inflicted upon the
power system of the target ship, which must then make
power-budget decisions that last one or more rounds.
In fleet combat, this is simplified. Divide the total ion
weapon damage by the ship’s Hull points, rounding
down, and check the Ion Damage table for the results.

For example, if an Ion weapon system inflicts 30,000
damage on a ship with 15,000 Hull Points, the result
is 2. The targeted ship must reduce Thrust by 2 or
eliminate 2 weapon systems. The targeted ship may
select a combination of the effects. For example, a
result of 2 may alternatively result in the temporary loss
of 1 Thrust and 1 weapon system for the round.

The effect lasts for one round unless the attacking
ship’s Offensive DM is twice the Defensive DM of the
target ship, in which case it lasts for two rounds. Note
that hardened systems are immune to ion weapons.

Fleet Battles

**Salvo Defence:** This score is applied against salvoes
of missiles and torpedoes. Salvo defence is recorded
for four separate categories: point defence weapons,
laser turrets, repulsors and electronic warfare. Add
the results of all four categories to obtain the ship’s
salvo defence pool. This pool is used for missile and
torpedo defence over the course of a round and is
restored to maximum in the following round provided
that the systems used for point defence have not been
damaged or destroyed in combat.

Calculate each category of the salvo defence pool as
follows:

For point defence weaponry:

- Add +4 for every Type I Point Defence Battery.
- Add +8 for every Type II Point Defence Battery.
- Add +12 for every Type III Point Defence Battery.

For laser turrets (if used for salvo defence):

- Add the Crew Skill score of the ship for every beam
  or pulse laser turret.
- Add an additional +1 for each double turret and +2
  for each triple turret.

For repulsors:

- Add five for every small repulsor bay.
- Add 10 for every medium repulsor bay.
- Add 50 for every large repulsor bay.

For electronic warfare:

- Divide the number of sensor operators by three,
  rounding up, to determine the base number of
  missiles eliminated. For example, if a ship has 67
  sensor operators, the base number is 23.
  - Add the Crew Skill score to the Electronic Warfare
  software number and multiply that by the base
  number, obtained above to obtain the electronic
  warfare pool number.

Add all of the above together to obtain the point
defence pool for the current round. Each point removes
one missile from incoming salvoes.

Against torpedoes, double the amount taken from
the pool. For example, 100 taken from the pool only
eliminates 50 torpedoes.

Note that laser turrets and repulsors can also be
used offensively. Only apply laser turret and repulsor
scores to the pool if these weapons are being used
for salvo defence.

Screens: Separate scores are recorded for meson
screens and nuclear dampers. For each, add Crew Skill
score to 3.5, multiply that by 10 and then multiply the
resulting figure by the number of screens.

Sandcasters: Total all sandcasters installed in turrets
on the ship. For example, the Pantheress has 100 triple
sandcaster turrets, so this value is 300.

Fleet combat is similar to space combat, including the
use of six-minute combat rounds. During each round,
the Travellers should work together to determine
how to use their resources. To keep things moving,
the Referee might want to impose a time limit on
deliberations, perhaps 5–10 minutes per turn. This
adds to the tension and excitement of the action and
ensures fast and efficient resolution of the battle.

Fleet Battles



FIGHTER SQUADRONS


Fighters may be assembled into squadrons of
any size. In battle, each squadron is treated
much like an individual ship with certain
exceptions. To evaluate the abilities of a
fighter squadron, determine the following and
record the information on a Fighter Squadron
Sheet (blank sheet provided in this chapter
for reproduction purposes):

Fighter Squadron Name and Class: The
name of the squadron, for example Blue
Squadron or 3rd Squadron. Keep in mind
that if squadrons are being launched from
multiple ships, the identifiers can become
more complicated due to the need for more
clarity during communications. For example,
Pantheress 12 for the 12th squadron launched
by the Pantheress. The class is the fighter
class. For example, Heavy Fighter.

Crew Skill: The Crew Skill is usually the
same as the squadron’s mothership but may
be different under various circumstances. For
example, it could be one level lower if it is a
new and very green squadron, or it might be
a level or two higher if a crack squadron of
fighter pilots has been assigned to the ship.

Weapons: List each weapon, its range
and damage value, obtained from the Fleet
Combat Weapons or Missile and Torpedo
Weapons table. When evaluating the range
of fighter weapons, be sure to consider the

range limitations of single Firmpoint-mounted
weaponry if the fighters in the squadron are
equipped with them. See Chapter 2: Weapons
and Screens for more information.

Offensive DM: Similar to assigning an
Offensive DM with the following differences:

- The Crew Skill score of the squadron.
- Add the rating of any Fire Control software.
- Add +1 if the fighters in the squadron are
  TL12–14, and +2 if they are TL15.

Defensive DM: Calculated as follows.

- The Crew Skill score of the squadron.
- Add the rating of any Evade software.
- Add +1 if the ship is TL12–14 and +2 if it is
  TL15.
- Add DM+1 against opposing ships at Close
  or Adjacent Range.

Thrust: The maximum Thrust rating of the
fighters in the squadron.

Armour: Divide the ship’s Armour by 3.5,
rounding up. For example, the light fighter has
Armour 2. Divide that value by 3.5 and round
up for squadron Armour 1.

Hull Points: Obtain the Hull points from the
fighter’s description and multiply it by the
number of fighters in the squadron. Every time
a number of Hull points equal to an individual
fighter’s Hull points is eliminated during
combat, one fighter is lost from the squadron.

Fleet Battles

STARTING A BATTLE


When ships fight using the fleet combat system, they
follow a similar procedure to the normal rules for
space combat but events are streamlined. There is no
detailed combat manoeuvring and the crew take few
specific actions.

Before a battle begins, it is important to note where
fleets are relative to one another. In many scenarios,
all that must be known is how far away each fleet
is from its opponents. This is determined by using
Range Bands.

Range Bands

Range Band Distance
Adjacent 1km or less
Close 1–10km
Short 11–1,250km
Medium 1,251–10,000km
Long 10,001–25,000km
Very Long 25,001–50,000km
Distant More than 50,000km

Most encounters start at Very Long or Distant ranges,
when the combatants first detect one another. However,
actual combat starts when one of the fleets moves into
range of their opponents’ weapons, typically Long range.
For a more detailed approach, see Fleet Manoeuvres on
page 122, which uses a Fleet Manoeuvre Chart to more
closely monitor movement and range.

**SELECT A FLAG SHIP**
Before the battle, each side must select its flag ship. A
flag ship must be equipped with a command bridge and
contains a fleet’s commanding officer and staff. As long
as the flag ship remains in the battle, its fleet receives
DM+1 during the Morale check that is made each
round. Keep in mind that neither side in a fleet battle
necessarily knows which ship is the flag ship but it is
usually the largest, most fearsome ship in the fleet.

**INITIATIVE**
Initiative is rolled for each ship in the battle, as follows:
2D + the ship’s Crew Skill + the fleet’s Thrust score +
Offensive DM.

#### FLEET COMBAT ROUNDS

For a more streamlined approach, simply roll Initiative
once for each fleet, using an average or approximation
of the ships’ Crew Skill scores.

TACTICS (NAVAL) SKILL
In addition, the commander of each fleet may make a
Tactics (naval) check at the start of a battle. The Effect
of this check is added to the Initiative of the fleet.

FLEET COMBAT STEPS


Much like in space combat, fleet combat is conducted
in steps:

1. **Manoeuvre Step:** In order of Initiative, each fleet
   manoeuvres based on its Thrust. The ships of a fleet
   must move as a unit, staying within Short range of
   each other, otherwise they disperse into multiple
   fleets or squadrons. Fighter squadrons and battle
   riders are the exception and may be launched at
   different Thrust levels and extend their reach beyond
   Short range in order to engage with the enemy.
2. **Attack Step:** In order of Initiative, each ship can
   attack, using weapons grouped in batteries of the
   same type. These are referred to as weapon systems.
3. **Actions Step:** In order of Initiative, ships can
   perform other actions, such as dispersing into
   squadrons, recovering fighters, checking morale,
   and jumping out of the system.

Once the Actions Step is complete, a fleet combat
round ends and, as long as there are still ships fighting,
a new round begins with the Manoeuvre Step.

MANOEUVRE STEP


In order of Initiative, each fleet may allocate Thrust to
movement (closing or increasing the range between it
and another fleet). Optionally use the Fleet Manoeuvre
Chart to track fleet movements. Using the map is
helpful if the fleet battle occurs at a static location, such
as a planet or gas giant, or when squadrons break off
from the fleet, forming separate combatants.

For most fleet combat encounters, calculating the
relative positions of two opposing fleets is all that
is needed. However, for more complex encounters,
vector-based movement rules may be included, as
described on page 116.

Fleet Battles



MOVEMENT


The amount of Thrust required to increase or decrease
the Range Band between fleets by one category, up
or down, is shown on the Fleet Movement table – the
Thrust listed is the amount required to move from that
Range Band to either the next closest or next farthest.
A fleet can spend Thrust over multiple rounds to close
or open a category.

If two fleets are travelling towards one another, then
the proportion of their Thrusts devoted to movement
are added together for the purposes of Range Band
changes. If one fleet is trying to escape another, then
subtract the lower Thrust from the higher to work out
the Range Band change – the faster fleet gains on or
pulls away from the slower.

It takes a lot of Thrust to move between Range Bands
once a fleet gets to Long range or further. Space is
vast and even the most powerful fleets take a long
time to cross any significant distance. At these ranges,
fleets rarely expend vital energy trying to change
range unless they are looking to board their targets or
escape the battle.

VECTOR


A fleet’s vector – its direction and accumulated velocity

- are only important if two fleets engage each other in

a limited battlespace. The reasons this might occur are
many. If one fleet is defending a world, moon, orbital
starport, planetoid or other large celestial object, then
the battle might well occur in a limited sphere. A fleet
might be jockeying for access to a gas giant or other
fuel source, positioned in high guard over squadrons
that are wilderness refuelling or simply ‘bugging out’
towards jump point with great haste.

Whatever the reason, there are times when fleet
combat occurs in a limited space. Under these
circumstances, it is important to keep track of

direction and how many successive rounds are spent
accelerating in one direction. For example, a fleet or
squadron that applies 6 Thrust in one direction for two
rounds moves at twice the speed had it only applied 6
Thrust for one turn. Supposing that 6 is the maximum
Thrust of the fleet, two rounds are required to slow
back down to zero if desired. If a fleet continues
to accelerate, it becomes exceedingly more time-consuming for it to slow down since every member
of the fleet must turn around and reduce speed by
applying the desired amount of Thrust.

If two fleets are not engaged in battle within a limited
sphere, then there is no need to record the vector. Simply
keep track of the relative differences in speed between
the two opposing fleets as described in Movement.

RANGE


The range between the ships of a fleet is important.
In typical deployments, a fleet can cover a large
area, anywhere from close orbit of a single world,
stretching out to the 100-diameter limit of that world,
or even multiple worlds in a single star system. In
the Third Imperium universe, a numbered fleet of the
Imperial Navy is divided into squadrons that patrol an
entire subsector.

For the purposes of fleet combat, combatants are
assembled in close formation, creating a ‘plane of
battle’ against an opposing fleet. The term hails back
to the age of sail, in which oceangoing naval ships
would form a ‘line of battle’, which was intended
to prevent friendly fire. In three-dimensional space
combat, the notion of a plane represents the ships of a
fleet occupying positions in space roughly equidistant
from an opposing mass of ships. In truth, the planar
metaphor quickly breaks down once a battle begins
and things become more chaotic. Distances vary as the
ships of each fleet perform evasive manoeuvres and
turn to point all of their firing arcs at the enemy. While

Ship Movement
Range Band Distance Thrust Required Example
Adjacent Less than 1km 1 Docked or in tight formation
Close 1–10km 1 Nearby or dogfighting vessels
Short 11–1,250km 2 Ships in same orbital path
Medium 1,251–10,000km 5 Surface to orbit
Long 10,001–25,000km 10 Near a planet
Very Long 25,001–50,000km 25 Within jump limit
Distant More than 50,000km 50 Distant ships

Fleet Battles

the notion of a plane of battle is convenient, in practice,
distances and formations fluctuate. Generally speaking,
the ships of a fleet attempt to stay within Medium range
of each other while maintaining a plane of battle that
faces the enemy.

The ships of a fleet often have several ships in reserve.
The reserve includes tankers, transports, auxiliaries
and other non-combatant vessels. Ships in the reserve
usually stay at Very Long or Distant range from enemy
ships, limiting their exposure to attacks.

There are three operational ranges for fleets, each of
which grants certain advantages and disadvantages:

Adjacent and Close: Fleet elements within these
ranges can use Point Defence software to defend one
another and transfer personnel between ships within
a single combat turn. The ships of a fleet that maintain
adjacent to close range gain +1 to their Defensive DM.

Short: This is the maximum distance that ships in the
plane of battle operate from one another.

Medium: Ships at Medium range from one another
form separate fleets or squadrons. Ships that stray to
Medium range can maintain their position in the fleet
provided they return to Short range in the following
turn. Ships in the reserve are the exception and are
considered part of the fleet in spite of their distance.

**LAUNCH FIGHTERS**
Fighters may be launched during the manoeuvre step.
For capital ships, this almost invariably means firing
them from launch tubes. Fleets often deploy some or

Cumulative Thrust

all of their fighters before approaching an enemy fleet.
However, this makes the fighters vulnerable to attack
as soon as the fleets come within firing range of each
other, so some fleet commanders choose to wait until
the battle has begun. Fighters may attack in the same
turn that they are launched.

ATTACK STEP


Once all fleets have worked out their movement, they
can launch attacks. This is done in Initiative order.

SELECT TARGETS AND ASSIGN WEAPONS


At the beginning of a turn, all ships and squadrons of
the attacking fleet must declare targets before firing. A
ship may divide its weapon systems to attack multiple
targets or apply them all to the same target. Likewise,
weapons of each system may be divided into batteries
to attack multiple targets. Therefore, a ship with 20
particle beam barbettes may use all of them against
a single target or divide them into smaller batteries to
attack more than one target.

There are two weapon systems that may be used for
offensive or defensive purposes: laser turrets and
repulsors. These weapons may be divided into multiple
batteries, some for point defence and some for attacks,
during the target selection phase. If a battery is used
for offensive purposes, the weapons in that battery are
not available for point defence during the current round
but may be reassigned in the following round.

As described in Fighter Squadrons, the fighters in
a squadron are considered to be a single ship for
purposes of attacks.

Fleet Battles



FIRING WEAPONS


There are three types of weapons: standard (all turrets,
barbettes and bays), spinal mount and missile (which
includes both missiles and torpedoes). In the desired
order, make attacks with each weapon system of a
single ship before proceeding to the next ship in the
fleet. Note that only spinal mount weapons require
a roll to hit. All other attacks are assumed to hit with
varying degrees of success.

DETERMINING DAMAGE FOR TURRETS,
BARBETTES AND BAY WEAPONS


To calculate the damage inflicted by turrets, barbettes
and bay weapons, go through the following:

- Obtain the base Damage value of the weapon, listed
  in the Fleet Combat Weapons table on page 112.
- For all weapons except meson guns (which ignore
  armour), subtract the target ship’s Armour from the
  adjusted Damage value.
- Fusion gun and railgun bays add DM+1 when
  attacking armoured ships.
- Add DM+1 if the weapon has the High Yield or
  Intense Focus customisation. Note that this is not
  cumulative for weapons that have both features.
- Multiply the adjusted damage by the Damage
  Multiplier.
- Multiply the adjusted damage by the number of like
  weapons used.

For example, a cruiser fires a battery of 50 particle
beam bays at a fleet carrier. The base Damage value
for the weapon is 6. Subtract the fleet carrier’s fleet
combat Armour value of 3. The adjusted Damage
value is3 (6-3). Multiply the adjusted damage by the
weapon’s Damage Multiple, which is 10 for small bays,
for a result of 30 and then multiply that number by
the total number of small bays used, which is 50 for a
damage subtotal of 1,500.

Finally, consult the Attack Effectiveness table to
determine the final Damage value.

ATTACK EFFECTIVENESS


Calculate the attack effectiveness by adding up
the following factors and then consult the Attack
Effectiveness table for the final Damage Multiple:

- Subtract the target ship’s Defensive DM from
  the Offensive DM of the attacking ship for the
  base Attack Factor.
- Add +1 if attacking a target at Short range.
- Subtract -2 if attacking a target at Long range or

subtract -4 if the target is at Very Long range.

- Subtract -2 if attacking a target (or squadron of

targets) who are each less than 100 tons in size
with any weapon other than turrets or barbettes.

The result is then compared to the Attack
Effectiveness table and the weapon system’s Damage
is modified as shown.

Note that all weapon systems cannot attack a target
beyond their maximum range.

Attack Effectiveness
Attack Factor Total Damage Multiple
-6 or less 0
-5 to -4 0.25
-3 to -2 0.5
-1 to 0 0.75
1–2 1
3–4 1.25
5+ 1.5

Multiply the damage subtotal by the Damage Multiple
for the final damage of the attack.

SPINAL MOUNT WEAPONS


Spinal mounts are the only weapons that must roll
to hit. The standard space combat rules apply, using
the Crew Skill score for the Gunner skill. Be sure to

ARMOUR


Armour reduces damage for all types of weapons
except meson guns and ion weapons, which
ignore all armour. The higher the armour value,
the greater the reduction in damage. In fact, as
armour values increase, some weapons become
exceedingly ineffective.

Well-armoured ships are impervious to attacks
from weapons that do not inflict enough damage
to penetrate their armoured outer shells. If a
weapon’s Damage value is less than half of a
ship’s Armour, it does no damage. As described in
Fleet Evaluation, Armour is determined by dividing
its original Armour value by 3.5 and rounding up
for the purposes of fleet combat. For example, a
ship with Armour 25 has a fleet combat Armour 8 (25/3.5, rounded up). Weapons whose Damage
rating is 4 or less do no damage to this ship.

Fleet Battles

apply all range, target size and fire control software
DMs. If a hit is scored, reduce the Damage score
by Armour (if applicable), multiply this by the spinal
mount damage multiple (1,000 per factor) and apply
the damage to the target ship.

**MISSILE WEAPONS**
Unlike lasers, particle beam and other energy and
projectile weapon systems, missile weapons have a
flight time. Refer to the Missile Flight table for guidance.

Missile Flight

Range Rounds-to-Impact
Medium and below Immediate
Long 1
Very Long 4
Distant 10

Note that the above rounds-to-impact numbers are for
missiles with Thrust 10. Advanced missiles have Thrust
15 and must be calculated separately (see the Missile
Flight Times table on page 37)

Apply the ship’s Salvo Defence score, recorded on its
Fleet Combat Ship Sheet, against incoming missiles. After
determining how many missile and torpedo weapons
successfully reach their target, pDetermine damage by
the following:

- Obtain the base Damage value of the missiles or
  torpedoes, listed in the Fleet Combat Missile and
  Torpedo Damage table on page 36.
- Subtract the target ship’s Armour from the adjusted
  Damage value.
- Multiply the adjusted damage by the number of
  missiles that detonate on target.

**SCREEN DEFENCE**
Points from the meson screen pool may be applied
to reduce the damage from any meson attacks. They
also remove the Radiation trait of each attack to which
points are applied.

Points from the nuclear damper pool may be applied to
reduce the damage from any nuclear missile, nuclear
torpedo or fusion weapon attacks. They also remove the
Radiation trait of each attack to which points are applied.

Screen pools are expended each round and are
replenished to their full amount in the following fleet
combat round provided that the screens have not been
disabled or destroyed.

SANDCASTER DEFENCE


Sandcasters reduce the amount of damage incurred
from laser, energy (fusion and plasma guns) and particle
beam weapons. To determine the damage reduction,
add the Crew Skill score to the ship’s Defensive DM and
then subtract the opposing ship’s Offensive DM to obtain
the Sandcaster Effectiveness score.

Sandcaster Effectiveness
Score Multiplier
0 or less 0.5
1–2 0.75
3+ 1

Multiply the Sandcaster score listed on the Fleet Ship
Sheet by the multiplier in the table above to obtain a
pool of points that the ship can use to reduce any laser,
energy or particle beam damage incurred in battle.

SPECIAL WEAPONS


Some weapons have special effects beyond their
normal damage-dealing capabilities. These cases are
described here.

Antiradiation Torpedo: A target’s Defensive DM is
halved (round down) against a salvo of these torpedoes.
Meson Weapons: These weapons do not have their
damage reduced by a target’s Armour. The Radiation
trait from meson weapons ignores the Antirad trait.
Multi-warhead Missiles/Torpedoes: Reduce the
target’s Salvo Defence by 20% against this weapon.

CRITICAL HITS


Critical hits occur after each 10% increment of a ship’s
adjusted hull points are depleted. Offensively superior
ships with well-trained crews can score additional
Critical Hits. Add the Offensive DM to the Crew Skill
score of the attacking ship and subtract the Defensive
DM of the target ship. If the total is four or higher,
an additional Critical Hit is scored on the target ship.
However, these Critical Hits are nullified under the
following circumstances:

- Ships larger than 2,000 tons ignore critical hits from
  turrets and barbettes.
- Ships larger than 10,000 tons ignore critical hits
  from all weapons except medium and large bay
  weapons and spinal mount weapons.
- Ships larger than 100,000 tons ignore critical hits
  from all weapons except large bays and spinal
  mount weapons.
- Spinal mount weapons can cause critical hits on
  ships of all sizes.

**CRITICAL HIT DETAILS**
Critical Hits have various effects on the performance
of major ship systems. Some result in a reduction in
performance, such as reducing the DM with respect to
one or more weapon or screen systems or the function
of the jump drive. Others reduce capacity, such as a
percentage of fuel, cargo or number of sensor stations.

When a system is listed as disabled, it can be
temporarily repaired during the Actions Step of the
following round. When a system is listed as destroyed,
it cannot be repaired or replaced until the ship is taken
to a base or shipyard.

Armour reductions are made to the original armour
value of the ship. After reducing the Armour rating,
recalculate it for the purposes of fleet combat as
described in Fleet Evaluation.

**RADIATION**
Ships with the Antirad trait are immune to the
Radiation trait of all weapons except meson guns.
In addition, meson screens nullify the Radiation trait
of meson weapons and nuclear dampers nullify any
Radiation incurred from nuclear fusion weapons to
which they are applied.

Ships affected by the Radiation (i.e, ships that do not
have the Antirad trait or relevant screen protection)
suffer the effects described in the following table.

Radiation Effects
Number of
Radiation

1 Reduce Crew Skill score by -1.
2 Reduce Crew Skill score by -2, reduce
laser turret, repulsor and electronic

laser turret, repulsor and electronic
warfare salvo defence by 50% and
eliminate two weapon systems.
4 Reduce Crew Skill score by -4, reduce
laser turret, repulsor and electronic
warfare salvo defence by 75% and
eliminate three weapon systems.
5 Ship crew essentially disabled and
ship can no longer function.

ACTIONS STEP


Unlike in space combat, in fleet combat most actions
are automatic and do not require dice rolls. However,
there are several actions and checks that can be made,
depending on the circumstances.

REPAIR SYSTEM


Each round, a ship's crew earns a number of Repair
Points equal to twice its Crew Skill score plus its Auto-Repair score. Repair Points can be used to repair
systems that have been affected by Critical Hits on a
point-for-point basis. For example, a ship with a Crew
Skill score of 2 and Auto-Repair/2 software earns 6
Repair Points per round. If their ship suffers two level
1 Critical Hits and two level 2 Critical Hits (a total of 6
levels), they can use their 6 Repair Points to fix all of
the affected systems. Repair points revert to zero at the
end of each round.

SPECIAL CASE: REPULSORS
For the purposes of fleet combat, repulsors are
expected to be used for missile and torpedo
defence. However, if repulsors are used as tractor
beams, they double the damage to all targeted
ships. Since repulsors can only be used on ships
in the sub-1,000-ton range, this is a niche case
but bears mention in the event that creative fleet
admirals want to put them to this use.

Fleet Battles



BREAKING OFF


Breaking off from battle occurs when one side decides
to exit the battle. A fleet that breaks off from a battle
incurs DM-1 to its Defensive DM and may not use
spinal mount weapons for the duration of the action. A
breaking off action ends when the departing fleet either
gets beyond the attack range of the opposing fleet or
jumps out of the system.

DISPERSING AND REASSEMBLING A FLEET


Depending on the objectives of a fleet battle, it might
become necessary to disperse the fleet into multiple
smaller fleets or even individual flotillas or squadrons.
Dispersing the fleet is a complex action that requires
multiple ships to break formation and reform into
smaller tactical groups. Doing so requires a task chain.
First make an Average (8+) Leadership check and
then a subsequent Difficult (10+) Tactics (naval) check,
adding the Task Chain DM. See the Fleet Dispersal
table for the results.

Note that other actions cannot be taken by ships
participating in a dispersal or reassembly.

Fleet Dispersal
Effect Result
-1 or less Failure. The ships of the fleet suffer DM-2
on their Offensive and Defensive DMs for
2 rounds, after which they may reattempt
the manoeuvre.
0 Success. Action requires 3 rounds, during
which Offensive and Defensive DMs are
reduced by -1.
1–2 Success. Action requires 2 rounds.
3+ Exceptional Success. Action requires 1
round.

A dispersal can result in the rearrangement of the fleet
into a virtually unlimited number of smaller groups. In
naval parlance, fleets are dispersed into squadrons
and squadrons into flotillas. It is assumed that the
typical navy drills and prepares for such events but the
execution of a dispersal is still complex and therefore
requires leadership and execution.

After a dispersal, the ships are divided into separate
fleets, flotillas, squadrons or other derivatives of the
original fleet. Create separate Fleet Sheets for each newly
formed unit. Should the dispersal result in the extraction
of a very small group, perhaps 1–3 ships, and that group

includes one or more of the Travellers, the Referee should
consider using the normal space combat rules instead
of the fleet combat rules presented in this chapter for the
actions of the new unit. While the fleet combat rules scale
for just about any encounter, the standard space combat
rules provide more detailed results.

Should the fleet commander desire a return to the
original formation or acquire ships from other fleets, a
fleet reassembly action is required. Simply make the
Leadership and Tactics (naval) checks as described
and consult the Fleet Dispersal table for the results.
A successful reassembly action returns the fleet to its
original formation, a new formation with different fleet
elements or incorporates newly acquired ships.

MORALE


Fleet combat deals with large numbers of ships, each
with their own commanding officers and crews. As
such, the course of a battle can affect morale, both
positively and negatively, depending on the events
that occur. A Morale check must be made each
round, potentially resulting in changes to the Crew
Skill score of all of the ships in a fleet for that round.
Morale-affecting events and their associated DMs
include the following:

- +1 if 50% or more of the ships in the opposing fleet
  are eliminated.
- +1 if the opposing flagship is eliminated.
- -1 for each 25% of one’s own ships that are
  eliminated.
- -1 if own flagship is eliminated.

FLEET MANOEUVRES


When using the Fleet Manoeuvre Chart, the Referee
must select a ‘fixed’ point in space around which
all ships and squadrons manoeuvre. This may be a
planet or moon, a space station or perhaps a convoy
travelling at a fixed velocity. This fixed point is the
centre of the chart.

Each ring around the fixed point represents a Range
Band, allowing you to plot the distance of any ship in
relation to the fixed point.

The chart is divided into quadrants and each Range
Band within a quadrant is divided into sectors (not to
be confused with the sector maps used to chart star
systems). These allow you to plot the position of ships
relative to the fixed point and one another.

**FLEET MANOEUVRE CHART**



For example, a cruiser has entered a system with
orders to track down and destroy a squadron of
corvettes. The cruiser is in C Quadrant, Sector 3, at
Distant range (you could abbreviate this to C3D). The
squadron of corvettes is on the other side of the system
in A Quadrant, Sector 1, at Medium Range (A1M).

MOVEMENT


To move around the Fleet Manoeuvre Chart, a ship
may either change its Range Band (moving inwards or
outwards from the fixed point) or move around the fixed
point within the same Range Band.

Ships may change Range Bands by expending Thrust
as normal, following the rules described in Movement,
above. So, if a fleet were at Very Long Range, its ships
must expend 25 Thrust to change their range to either
Long or Distant. The vector of a fleet may also be
considered. For example, to remain in the target range
band, the ship must also use Thrust to reduce speed
lest they continue beyond the target location.

Ships may move to an adjacent Sector in the same
Range Band by expending the same amount of Thrust.

For example, the squadron of corvettes we met before
are currently at Medium range in Sector 1 of the A
Quadrant. They could expend 5 points of Thrust to
move to either Close or Long range in the A Quadrant (moving to either Sector 1 or 2 at Long range, as both
are adjacent to their starting position), or they could
expend 5 points of Thrust to move around the fixed
point, to either Sector 2 at Medium range, or Sector 2
at Medium range in the B Quadrant.

ATTACKS


Attacking another ship or squadron using the Fleet
Manoeuvre Chart is done in the same way as normal
for the Fleet Combat system. However, the Fleet

Manoeuvre Chart allows you to determine the range
to a target. This is determined by the position of the
attacking fleet relative to its target.

Missile Salvoes
The Fleet Manoeuvre Chart can also be used to track
the movement of missile and torpedo salvoes en route
to their targets.

Salvoes can be tracked and moved as if they were
ships, albeit with a lot more Thrust to move across the
chart. Referees should assume they will always move
along a path that requires the least amount of Thrust.

CELESTIAL TERRAIN


Objects in space may become part of the ‘battlefield’
in fleet combat. Such objects include gas giants, rocky
planets, planetoids and space stations. Under specific
circumstances, a fleet is entitled to certain benefits due
to proximity with such objects.

A fleet may use a gas giant or rocky planet as an
obstruction, provided it is using superior Thrust and
remains within Adjacent to Short range of the planet.
Doing so provides Defensive DM+1 for each point
of Thrust superiority. Essentially, this means that the
fleet is using the object as an impediment against
enemy attacks.

While far too small to provide protection for a full fleet,
a fighter squadron may use a planetoid of reasonable
size (one kilometre or larger in diameter), a space
station or similarly sized object in the same manner.
However, this might put said objects in jeopardy if the
opposing fleet decides to ‘shoot through’ the object if it
has the firepower to do so.

# B OARDING ACTIONS

Being boarded can be as simple as giving another
spacecraft permission to dock and then allowing an
officious boarding party to come inside for a cursory
inspection or, at the other extreme, a tooth-and-nail
pitched battle that starts at space-combat range and
ends in a room-to-room firefight within the ship.

The description presented here is, in some ways,
an abbreviated version of the one presented in the
Specialist Forces book. The phases listed here are the
same but the approach is more general, not focused on
the actions of a mercenary unit or usage of specialised
equipment. The two sets of rules are not mutually
exclusive and can be combined if desired.

CONDUCTING A BOARDING ACTION


Boarding actions may be resolved with the abstract
system presented on page 175 of the Traveller Core
Rulebook, or by using the guidance provided in this
chapter, or that in Specialist Forces. The method
chosen should reflect the desired outcome. If the
Travellers are not involved in the boarding action,
the abstract system might work best. However, if the
Travellers are involved in the boarding action on one
side or the other, more detail might be necessary –
and fun!

REQUIREMENTS


Boarding actions require the ship that is to be boarded
to be inert or restrained from making evasive actions.
This means that the ship is not operating its manoeuvre
drives voluntarily or due to disablement. Routine
inspections occur when a ship voluntarily allows itself
to be boarded. Forced boarding occurs when the crew
of the boarded ship resists. Forced boarding can be
performed even while both ships are using thrust under
the following conditions but even then it might result in
damage to both spacecraft:
•	 The attacking ship must be able to apply more
Thrust than the ship to be boarded. A ship that has
Thrust parity or superiority can, in theory, evade
boarding indefinitely.

•	 The attacking ship must have a means to get into
the ship after docking, linkage or spatial parity
has been established. The latter occurs when the
two ships have – for whatever reason – ceased
manoeuvring and evading one another and,
therefore, boarding can proceed.

There is a third type of boarding action that is not
covered in this chapter: salvage or exploratory
operations. A derelict or disabled ship may be boarded
using some of the mechanics described here but
such actions do not require all of the listed phases.
Approach, contact and entry are assumed and conflict
only occurs if someone... or something, unexpected is
discovered aboard the ship.

ROUTINE INSPECTIONS


There are many types of boarding actions but each
starts with the approach of a ship, linkage of the two
ships and contact between members of each ship’s
crew. Boarding actions are rarely welcome and,
even if expected, they are typically a diversion from
the Travellers’ ultimate goal: arrival at a starport, a
meeting with another ship, departure from a world or
some other objective.

Boarding actions are frequently carried out by naval
and marine personnel, whose responsibilities include
the security of the space around a world, orbital starport
or another item of strategic value. Being boarded by
the navy is standard fare for most spacers, a minor
inconvenience to be tolerated en route to whatever
destination awaits them. Boarding parties vary with the
size and type of ship being boarded. Small ships, in
the 100- to 1,000-ton range, typically warrant a party of
4–12. Some boarding parties bring one or more robots as
well, some of which might be armed but others with only
sensory devices. The compositions of such teams varies.
If they hail from a powerful navy with a large budget,
such as the Imperial Navy, then several members of the
party will be well-armed and armoured, possibly including
2–4 marines in boarding vacc suits, combat armour or
even battle dress. Imperial Navy personnel wear naval
vacc suits such as that depicted on page 71 of Element
Cruisers. If, however, the boarding party hails from a small
planetary navy with a limited budget and jurisdiction, their
equipment might be less impressive.

FIGHTING CEASES



BOARDING ACTIONS



Boarding parties expect to enter a ship via its primary
airlock, although exceptions can be made depending
on the circumstances. Most boarding parties seal the
door to their own ship after inserting the boarding party.
The fact is, no matter how innocuous the ship they are
inspecting might appear, they cannot fully know what to
expect once they are inside. Boarding parties usually
find themselves inspecting a marginally well-maintained
ship with a semi-competent crew who are doing what
they can to keep the ship flying but there is always the
chance that they are interstellar pirates, terrorists or
other malcontents who could be armed and dangerous.
Boarding parties must be prepared for this possibility
because their lives might very well depend upon it.
Preventing a ‘reverse boarding’ by sealing the airlock is
standard operating procedure.

After the boarding party is inserted, observation of the
airlock is maintained with surveillance devices from
the boarding ship or with personnel placed on the
inside of their own airlock door. After entering, most
boarding parties place one or two guards at the airlock
door of the ship they have boarded. Some close the
boarded ship’s door but some – equipped with vacc
suits or similar equipment – prefer to keep it open as an
insurance policy, sometimes even barring it from being
shut. Should things go awry, the crew of a boarded
ship have their own self-preservation to think about and
assaulting a boarding party with their own airlock door
open does not bode well for survivability.

The remainder of the team performs whatever duty
they have come to execute, including, but not limited to,
the following:
•	 Cargo bay searches
•	 Bridge and transponder checks
•	 Crew and passenger interviews
•	 Engineering and fuel tank inspections

Efficient teams with enough personnel might split up
to perform their duties, especially if they have two or
more objectives to accomplish and want to do so in a
timely fashion.

Inspections can be curt and perfunctory, taking only a
few minutes, or long and arduous, taking hours or even
an entire day. While most inspections are superficial,
some are intrusive, requiring the opening of cargo
modules, removal of bulkheads or hull plates, opening
of fuel tanks and other time-consuming and invasive
procedures. In the Charted Space universe, the space
between worlds in the Imperium is Imperial Navy
territory and they can perform detailed inspections with
little in the way of legal pretext.

The tools of the trade that inspectors bring with
them affect the duration of the inspection. Teams
with high-tech ships might have done the majority of
their inspection before even entering the ship using
densitometers, life scanners and neural activity
sensors. The job of the boarding party in such cases
is more psychological in nature: to impose authority,
intimidate or to determine the nature and motives of
the ship’s crew. Other boarding parties have lower
technology and might take hours since they must
perform the inspection manually.

Should something go wrong during an inspection – for
example, the discovery of smuggled goods, finding a
harboured fugitive or aggressive behaviour from the
crew – things can go sour. Well-trained boarding parties
know how to reassemble quickly. If things get hot,
boarding parties will attempt to regroup and the mission
takes on a different approach altogether, with weapons
drawn and possibly ending with arrests being made
and the ship impounded and transferred to the nearest
naval base or starport facility. Should this occur, the
Travellers can expect to pay a heavy fine at the very
least but they might even be subjected to incarceration
or the loss of their ship.

Under normal circumstances the inspection happens,
the boarding party returns to their ship and the two
ships part ways, none the worse for wear. Over the
course of a gaming session, these interactions can
be glossed over but they can add to the drama of an
adventure or even just a routine visit to a world. If
there are political tensions or heightened Law Levels
in particular star systems or even the threat of war in
or nearby the system, the likelihood of being boarded
increases. Any time the Travellers arrive in a new star
system and make their way to the system mainworld
or other key world, make an Average (8+) check to
determine whether they are subjected to an inspection,
adding in the following DMs:

Event DM
Population 5- DM-2
Law Level 0–2 DM-2
Law Level 3–5 DM-1
Law Level 6–9 DM+0
Law Level A+ DM+2
Government 7 or A+ DM+1
Naval Base present DM+1
Amber Zone DM+2
Red Zone DM+4
Other (war, political strife, pandemic, etc.) DM+1

BOARDING ACTIONS





The method of inspection should be determined by the
Referee. If the world is high-tech, it might simply be a
scan of their ship from Close or Adjacent range with
starport or patrol spacecraft sensors. Any irregularities
are likely to result in a more thorough, in-person
inspection. Lower tech systems, especially those with
their own navies, are more likely to take a hands-on
approach from the outset.

Provided that things go well and nothing untoward
is discovered in the ship, the inspection should be
completed without any problems, the boarding party
returns to its ship and they depart, allowing the
Travellers to go on their merry way. This encounter
can be resolved with roleplaying but the Referee may
add several task rolls to help determine the outcome.
Following are some examples.

Pulling rank to prevent a boarding party from inspecting
the ship: Difficult (10+) Diplomat check (1D minutes, EDU)
or Average (8+) Diplomat check (1D minutes, SOC).
Cooling things down if a disagreement occurs between
the ship’s crew and the boarding party: Opposed check,
Persuade or Diplomat (SOC) by a member of the ship’s
crew vs. Leadership (SOC) by the boarding party.
Preventing a boarding party from seeing something
you do not want them to see: Opposed Deception (DEX, INT or SOC depending on how the skill is used)
vs. Recon (INT) check. Additional DMs may apply,
depending on whether the item, person or ship feature
in question is already camouflaged, concealed or
otherwise obscured from view.

Routine inspections are an inconvenience for
Travellers but there is no reason for them to be dull or
uninformative. The exchange between the boarding
party and the Travellers can give them a sense of the
world they are visiting, events transpiring in the vicinity
and what they can expect to happen next.

FORCED BOARDING


The Travellers’ ship might be subjected to forced
boarding by a variety of parties including naval patrols,
pirates or corsairs, rival groups (a.k.a., ‘the bad guys’ in
a given adventure) and others.

Naval patrols do not typically engage in a forced
boarding unless provoked to do so. Circumstances
under which this can happen include – but are not
limited to – the Travellers evading a routine inspection,
the Travellers’ ship being recognised (rightly or
wrongly) as one that was involved in criminal activity or
the ship’s transponder broadcasting conflicting data.

Pirates and corsairs board ships for obvious reasons
but the differences between the two should be
noted. Pirates are criminals who want to steal the
Travellers’ cargo (and possibly their entire ship!) for
their own personal gain. Corsairs are commerce
raiders, working to disrupt the flow of trade for political
reasons. Both are thieves who intend to abscond
with the Travellers’ freight and cargo but pirates are
potentially more desperate and hence dangerous,
while corsairs are, on some level, soldiers in the
employ of a planetary or interstellar government. The
latter usually have a letter of marque that attempts
to legitimise their thefts in the name of a patron
government. Another difference between the two
is the quality of their ships. Pirates tend to operate
ramshackle spacecraft, some of which are behind on
maintenance and in poor working condition.

There are certainly well-heeled pirates with much better
ships (for example, the Pirate Lords of Theev from
the Pirates of Drinax campaign) but for the most part
pirate ships are not top of the line. Meanwhile, corsair
ships often reflect the wealth of their patrons. While
some corsairs are simply contractors, operating their
own ships, others use craft bequeathed to them by
their patrons. As such, corsair ships can be impressive,
high-tech and well-armed, and therefore considerably
more dangerous in space combat.

Other groups that might oppose the Travellers include
a wide range of possibilities but are most often ‘the
villains’ of an adventure or campaign. Their motives
vary but if they plan to board the Travellers’ ship, they
presumably want something or someone aboard the
ship; otherwise, they would simply attempt to destroy it.

APPROACH


The first step of a forced boarding is the approach.
Space is big. If a ship can apply more thrust than that of
their assailants, the encounter begins beyond the range
of weapons and the ship under pursuit wants to avoid
the encounter, then the Approach phase cannot begin in
earnest. However, if an aggressor has superior thrust,
they can close on the other ship, first coming into space-combat range, engaging in combat (if the ship under
pursuit refuses to surrender) and, if victorious, closing
the gap in order to board. Refer to Space Combat in
the Traveller Core Rulebook to resolve this portion of
the Approach phase. Of course, all of this is moot if
one ship has enough fuel to jump and they are at safe
distance from a gravity well to do so. If given the option
to avoid fighting altogether, jumping out of the system or
microjumping to another location within the system ends
the Approach phase immediately.

BOARDING ACTIONS



Such encounters might begin with radio contact.
This is an opportunity for roleplaying. The crew of
the opposing ship might declare their intentions... or
not. Communications offer the Travellers the chance
to determine their opponents’ objectives before a
conflict occurs. Harsh words and bold claims can
make the encounter a rich one. Should the Travellers
turn the tables on their would-be assailants, then
they can become the ones forming a boarding party if
they so desire.

Regardless of who boards whom, the Approach phase
begins with space combat – or the avoidance thereof

- and ends when one ship has been subdued, unable

or unwilling to apply Thrust, and therefore powerless to
prevent a boarding action.

CONTACT


The Contact phase is the final step before actual
boarding begins. Typically, Contact occurs when
one ship is linked to another by mating airlocks or
creation of an entry point by using a breaching tube,
breaching charges, spacecraft weapons or other
means. Alternatively, Contact may occur via a free-boarding exercise, in which vacc-suited or armoured
boarders make the leap from their own ship to the ship
they intend to board and then enter through a standard
aperture (for example, an airlock, cargo bay doors or
maintenance hatch) or create one using weaponry or
explosives. Free boarding is extremely dangerous but
well-trained teams can pull it off. The advantage of
free boarding is that it reduces the threat of damage
to one’s own ship or the possibility of being ‘reverse
boarded’ after losing the fight during the Conflict phase.

While the crew of a ship being boarded may have
given up on using thrust to get away or prevented from
doing so due to a damaged or disabled manoeuvre
drive, there are still mischievous – if potentially costly

- ways that they can stave off a boarding party. Most

ship’s weapons are highly ineffective against small
targets such as a free-boarding party but sandcasters
can be used against them with deadly results. Clever
engineers can engage the life support system to
violently eject air from various portals in order to create
minor position adjustments, thereby making it difficult
to board and possibly colliding with the opposing
ship if it draws close. Moves like this are desperate
and often serve only to invoke the ire of the boarding
party but people do irrational things under pressure.
Furthermore, if the ship being boarded does not
know the intentions of the boarding party, last-ditch or
seemingly suicidal moves begin to make more sense.

**TUMBLING SHIPS**
Deliberately causing a ship to tumble can prevent
or at least delay a boarding action. However,
entering, cancelling and stopping a tumble are
challenging actions.

A pilot may deliberately enter or cancel a tumble
by making a Routine (6+) Pilot check (D3 space-combat rounds, DEX). During the attempt, the ship
cannot manoeuvre in any other way. If the check
is failed, the vessel may create some inconvenient
rotation but docking or free boarding can still
be attempted at DM-1. If the check succeeds,
the pilot can continue to make random evasive
manoeuvres without counteracting the tumble but
deliberate manoeuvres are subject to a negative
DM determined by the severity of the tumble.
The severity of an induced tumble is rated by the
negative DM applied to attempts to dock with
the tumbling ship. This DM is equal to D3 for an
accidental tumble caused by control loss and D3
plus the Effect of the Pilot check made to initiate
a deliberate tumble. This DM is applied to any
attempts to attach lines, or for personnel to get onto
the hull, and conventional docking is impossible.

Correcting a tumble can be tricky. Many starship
control systems have an automatic tumble
cancellation system that reduces the severity of the
tumble by one each space combat round but a good
pilot can do it more quickly.

Make an Average (8+) Pilot check (DEX) with a
negative DM equal to the severity of the tumble. If
the check is made, the tumble is cancelled. If it is
failed, the Effect of this check is the new severity of
the tumble.

Tumbles can be stopped by opposing ships that
are equipped with forced linkage apparatuses or by
ramming the tumbling ship to reduce the tumble;
however, only forced linkage apparatuses do so
without potential harm to both ships.

Ramming a ship to reduce its tumble can be costly.
The attacking ship’s Pilot must make a Difficult (10+)
Pilot check (DEX) to close the gap and ‘gently’ ram
the target ship. Failure results in damage to both
ships equal to damage dice of 2 + the negative Effect
as a positive modifier. For example, a failure with an
Effect of -1 results in 3D damage. Armour reduces
damage as normal. Each successful ramming action
reduces the tumbling severity by one, regardless of
the Effect of the Pilot check.

BOARDING ACTIONS





If the boarding ship has committed to establishing a
physical connection before boarding, a forced linkage
apparatus (see page 57) is a highly effective tool to
prevent mischief by the crew of the opposing ship.
While it is not fool proof, this tool increases the chances
for a successful Contact, adding DM+2 to further
steps that will achieve Contact; for example, linking an
airlock, which requires an Average (8+) Pilot check.

ENTRY


The simplest entry between two ships is via a pair of
mated airlocks. If this is the route taken, the boarding
party makes their way to the opposing ship’s airlock door
and, if allowed to enter, simply walk through the door
after it is opened. However, forced boarding is rarely that
easy. There is the danger of booby-trapped airlocks for
one (see page 59). Wily ship captains may have all sorts
of surprises arranged for prospective invaders.

More often than not, the boarding party must only
overcome a single impediment: a locked door.
Following are ways to get through a locked airlock door
or other portal or surface.

Force an airlock door open with mechanical tools:
Formidable (14+) Mechanic check (2D rounds, STR).
After a successful check, an additional 1D rounds are
required to get the door fully open using a crowbar or
similar tool, exposing the boarding party to the dangers
of attacks through the gap.
Force a maintenance hatch or cargo door open with
mechanical tools: Very Difficult (12+) Mechanic check (2D rounds, STR). Getting in these types of doors
is usually easier than an airlock but may result in
explosive decompression if atmospheric life support
has not been evacuated to storage tanks.
Breach the ship with personal weaponry: Routine (6+)
Gun Combat (energy) check (DEX) or Average (8+)
Gun Combat (slug) check (DEX). Short or close range
is required, with no range bonuses since the target for
a breach must be very small. The difficulty does not

reflect how hard it is to target the ship but the danger
to the attacker. If failed, the Traveller takes 1D damage
for every negative point of Effect. This reflects ricochets
or energy blowback. Firing at greater range eliminates
this danger but requires higher difficulty checks since
any successful breaching attempt requires repeated
pinpoint accuracy. Using weaponry is a rather ham-fisted way to breach a ship but if no other options are
available, it is ultimately viable. See the Resilience of
Starship Components table for how many rounds must
be accurately fired to breach ship doors and surfaces.

If boarders are committed to using weaponry to breach
a ship, ship’s weaponry (for example, a pulse laser
turret) is far more effective but can cause more damage
than desired. Keep in mind that these weapons inflict
spacecraft-scale damage, as described in the Traveller
Core Rulebook. If the damage they inflict is high
enough, a critical hit might also be registered, which
can produce unexpected results.

Use a cutting tool to penetrate a door or create a
breach: Average (8+) Mechanic check (DEX). See the
Cutting Tools table for the Tech Level, cut rate and
cost of each tool. A cutting tool removes its Cut Rate
in Resilience each round +1 for every point of Effect.
For example, a rescue cutter has a base cut rate of 3.
The Traveller rolls a9 (Effect +1) on their check, giving
them a total cut rate of 4 per round.

Breaching a ship that has not evacuated its
atmospheric life support into storage tanks can have
explosive consequences. Crew on military ships don
vacc suits and store their air supply prior to reporting
to battle stations. Most civilian ship captains are aware
of the dangers but due to the rarity of space combat
for most of them, many do not adequately prepare for
explosive decompression. Prudent ones evacuate key
sections of the ship at the very least including the cargo
hold and engineering sections. The bridge, common
area and accommodations sections often retain their
atmospheres despite the hazard. Most crews are
knowledgeable enough that they put vacc suits or

BOARDING PARTY WEAPONS AND ARMOUR


The weapons of choice for a boarding action
are blades and handguns. For a handgun, most
boarding parties prefer snub pistols or laser
pistols for two reasons: both have the Zero-G
trait (indicating that they have no recoil) and
neither do extensive damage to ship systems
when shots are missed.

Weapons with recoil often turn out to be a bad
choice. If the power plant goes offline, life support
systems are damaged or artificial gravity has been
deliberately turned off and therefore no gravity
is present, weapons without the Zero-G trait can
send their users careening off the bulkheads
of a ship, possibly injuring themselves or their
unfortunate teammates as stray shots become
friendly fire.

Most ships are too cramped for long guns to be
effective but when boarding parties want a little
more punch, they often choose the accelerator
rifle (which also has the Zero-G trait), laser
carbines or similar small weapons. During a
boarding action, these mid-sized weapons incur
DM-1 when fired due to the difficulty of using
even a compact long gun in the tight spaces of a
ship. Any long gun larger than a carbine such as
an assault rifle, advanced combat rifle or laser
rifle incurs DM-2 when fired. Heavy weapons are
virtually impossible to use, incurring DM-4.

While hand grenades can be used during a
boarding action, they are highly random and
destructive, and might cause a lot of unexpected

damage. There is also a great deal of danger
in ricochets or poorly thrown grenades, which
can end up being detonated amidst one’s allies
instead of their intended targets. Most participants
on either side of a boarding action do not use
grenades for the above reasons.

Most members of a typical boarding party also
carry a blade of some sort. In the Charted Space
universe, the blade of choice is the cutlass,
favoured for its heft, striking power and curved
blade, which makes it easier to use in tight
spaces. The broad flat portion of the cutlass also
enables it to be used as a bludgeon or a tool
to move aside small objects and open doors. A
blade or dagger will do in a pinch but neither is as
effective as the cutlass.

Armour selection is also important. The boarding
vacc suit is preferred since it provides good
Protection and does not hinder movement. The
combat environment suit is a decent alternative
but fails within D3 x 10 minutes in full vacuum.
Heavier choices like combat armour and battle
dress certainly provide more Protection but both
make it difficult to navigate the tight spaces of
a ship. Wearing combat armour causes DM-1
to all physical actions during boarding actions
and battle dress incurs DM-2. Should the threat
be significant enough to warrant enhanced
protection, a boarding party might select heavier
armour despite the disadvantages but most opt for
something lighter.

BOARDING ACTIONS





vacuum-sealed armour on and a ready supply of soft
suits should be on hand for passengers and anyone
else who does not have a vacc suit.

These things should be taken under consideration when
breaching a civilian ship. The Referee should roll 2D: on
a result of 2–8, the ship’s atmosphere has been properly
stored but on 9–12, the breached section retained its
atmosphere and sudden decompression occurs. Refer
to Atmosphere and Vacuum in the Traveller Companion
for more information on what can happen.

Using a breaching tube to enter a ship effectively
creates a sealed passageway, thereby preventing
a decompression event regardless of the fact that
the tube has just created a sizable hole in the ship.
Breaching tubes are fast, usually cutting through the
outer hull of an unarmoured ship in under two minutes,
scarcely giving its crew time to react. If an uninhabited
part of the ship is targeted, the boarding party can
often be inserted before the crew of the ship has time
to figure out where the breach is being made, arm
themselves and get to the site in time to oppose them.

CONFLICT


If a boarding party must go to the trouble of forced entry
into a ship, then some form of conflict with its crew is
inevitable. Fighting aboard a ship is dangerous. While
the hull can withstand dozens of shots from most slug
or energy weapons, there are a great many delicate
components within a ship that cannot. In addition, the
tight corridors on most ships are prone to ricochets, fire
and chemical hazards, and the possibility – however
remote – that liquid-hydrogen fuel lines could be
ruptured, causing a catastrophic explosion.

A well-trained boarding party has clear objectives and a
plan to achieve them. If the objective is to take the ship,
then there are several key areas that must be taken:
•	 The bridge and other control centres
•	 Engineering
•	 Turrets and fire control stations

The bridge is the most critical target since controls are
present for all other sections of the ship. Getting to
the bridge enables a boarding party to shut down all
systems if they have access to its controls. Access to
controls on most ships is almost always secured in some
fashion, including biometric locks and, at the low end
of technology, passwords. Most security systems can
be overridden by using Intrusion software (refer to the

Central Supply Catalogue), especially if employed by a
skilled operator with Electronics (computers) skill and
software of a higher Tech Level than that of the ship’s
computer (add DM+1 for each level of difference).

If bridge controls are used to shut down controls in
other areas of a ship, the instruction can be overridden.
Some ships have all security removed so that a trusted
engineer simply asks for an override in the engineering
section and it is granted. Others are secure and require
more of an effort.

To override bridge control from elsewhere in the ship:
Formidable (14+) Electronics (computers) check (1D
minutes, EDU). Success results in local control being
returned to the individual section.

For example, someone in Engineering can reacquire
local control of the drives, power plant and life support
systems of the ship. Note that this is limited to the
individual section, so someone in engineering cannot
then obtain control of the ship’s turrets, or vice versa.

If the objective of the boarding party is more limited –
for example, acquiring a specific item from the cargo
hold, extracting a prisoner or capturing a specific
individual – then all of the ship’s controls might remain
in the hands of the crew and may be used against the
boarding party. If acquisition of the bridge is not an
objective of a boarding action, the boarding party must
be prepared to deal with that lack of control. Breaking
through locked iris valves, deactivated gravity in
specific ship sections and other problems must be dealt
with as they arise.

Armed combat aboard a ship has two important
features that require further description: stacking
and missed shots. Stacking is the order in which the
boarding party or ship’s crew – or segment thereof

- are arranged. Depending on which side an attack

comes from, the first or last person in line receives the
bulk of the attacks.

After a successful roll to hit, roll 2D. On a 9 or less
the first target in the stack is hit. On a 10–12, the
round hits another member of the group. Likewise,
if a specific target is desired in a group, the attacker
must overcome the stacking. Use a variation of the
same mechanic: the attacker must roll 10+ on 2D to
aim at anyone other than the front target in the stack;
otherwise, the front person becomes the target before
BOARDING ACTIONS rolling to hit.

Missed shots embed in a soft target or hit something
in the ship after ricocheting. Unless the circumstances
are unusual, such as a battle in an open cargo hold,
fired rounds must strike a target. Hard targets, such
as bulkheads, cause a ricochet that might result in
an unexpected target being hit. Soft targets can be
other members of the boarding party, control systems,
furniture or any number of other items that can absorb
a round from a weapon. Ricochets might even bounce
back and hit the attackers. See the Missed Shots table.

Ships with armoured bulkheads (see page 43) reduce
the potential for damage to ship’s systems. Apply
DM-1 to rolls on the Missed Shots table if armoured
bulkheads are present where a firefight occurs.

The consequences of a missed shot that hits a minor
or critical system are not always immediately felt. For
example, damaged ceiling lights might flicker without
turning off immediately or a round that punctures a
fuel line might cause a slow leak that does not cause
major damage until later. The type of weapon inflicting
the damage should also be taken into consideration. If
the round comes from an accelerator rifle or other light
slug weapon, the damage is relatively minor and might
not do much to the system other than make it faulty.
However, a shot from a laser rifle or heavier weapon
is likely to cause more immediate consequences. The
Damage Thresholds table provides guidance.

Missed Shots

2D Target
1–3 The round bounces back and hits a randomly determined member of the attacking group on an 8+.
4–5 The round ricochets and hits a randomly determined member of the opposing group on an 8+.
6–8 Minor system damaged (for example, ceiling lights, door controls and so forth.)
9–10 The round embeds in a non-critical item (for example, furniture, a wood wall panel and so forth.)
11–12 Critical system damaged (for example, airlock door control, fuel line, bridge controls and so forth.)

Damage Thresholds

Damage of Weapon Results
1–3D Minor systems are damaged but may be repaired with an Average (8+) Mechanic check (2D minutes, EDU) provided spare parts are available. Critical systems are superficially
damaged but remain functional.
4–5D Minor systems are destroyed and require complete replacement. Critical systems are
damaged but may be repaired with an Average (8+) Mechanic check (1Dx10 minutes,
EDU) provided spare parts are available.
6D+ Minor systems are destroyed and require complete replacement. Critical systems are
damaged, will result in additional problems (hull or fuel-line link, critical controls offline
and so forth) and must be completely replaced.

Note that grenades or weapons with the Blast trait automatically register a Damage Threshold of 6D+.

BOARDING ACTIONS





The Conflict phase ends when either the boarding
party or ship’s crew ceases attacking the other. For
surviving members of a boarding party that has failed
to accomplish its objectives, this might include a retreat
to their own ship, which prolongs the phase until all
fighting has ended. Even when the boarding party
successfully achieves its objectives – taking the bridge,
engineering, weapons and so on – things become
more complicated when some members of the ship’s
crew refuse to surrender elsewhere in the ship. At
this point, the boarding party must either search them
out, persuade captured crew to get the holdouts to
surrender or employ other means to neutralise them

FUEL SYSTEMS


Fuel takes up an inordinate amount of space on
most starships, increasing with jump capability.
Small craft, which carry very little fuel, do not share
this characteristic. On a ship out of the factory, fuel
tanks, lines and control systems are concealed
from view and access but over time, access panels,
repaired or reinforced lines and other components
can become exposed and therefore vulnerable.
The danger should not be overstated. Only the
faultiest, most poorly maintained ship has multiple
points of exposure to its fuel system, but the severe
impact of a rupture makes it worth mentioning.
Boarding actions end quickly when a fuel explosion
incinerates both the boarding party and crew of the
ship simultaneously.

Fortunately, most fuel systems have baffles,
sectioning the tanks into compartments, so if a
rupture and subsequent explosion occurs, the
damage is limited. In vacuum, fuel explosions
inflict 8D damage with Blast 10, which typically
consumes an entire compartment in a starship
of under 1,000 tons. Non-vacuum-sealed armour
provides no protection but vacc suits and other
vacuum-sealed armour provides full protection.
If the compartment does not have its oxygen
evacuated, the explosion is much more severe
and the damage is increased to 3DD.

such as using life support systems to control oxygen
flow where suspected holdouts might be in hiding or,
at the extreme, pressurising an area and then opening
apertures such as airlocks and cargo hold doors to
eject them into space.

The possibilities and the potential for drama are endless.
A member of the boarding party gets lost and is taken
hostage by the crew. The bridge is taken and the
crew are ordered to stand down but some of the crew
want to fight to the bitter end. In the ‘fog of war’, the
wrong objective, prisoner or other target is extracted
by the boarding party and they realise it only after
disconnecting the airlock umbilical and flying away.
The Conflict phase is likely to be the most chaotic of a
boarding action even when the odds are one-sided.

SECURE


The Secure phase occurs after all fighting has ceased
and the ship has been secured by either the boarding
party or its crew. A boarding party whose objective is
complete takeover of a ship must secure all sections,
round up crew, identify and remove any booby traps,
and ensure that all of the ship’s key components – or
at least those not damaged during the boarding action

- remain intact. While tasks like drive repair or getting

key systems back online might still need to be done,
the Secure phase is complete once one side has full
control of the ship.

A boarding party with limited objectives completes
the Secure phase after they have completed their
objectives and successfully returned to their own ship.

Sometimes the boarding party is defeated by the crew
of the ship. In this case, the Secure phase is complete
when all members of the boarding party have either
been killed, neutralised, captured or forced back into
their own ship. The term ‘secure’ is relative for the crew
whose ship was disabled during the Approach phase.
A vindictive attacker whose boarding party has failed
must decide what to do next. They might leave the crew
of the ship – whose manoeuvre drive or power plant
might be disabled – to their fates, pulverise the ship
with weaponry after disengaging or negotiate to obtain
their objectives whether that be the ship itself or some
other goal.

# SPACECRAFT OF THE THIRD IMPERIUM

This chapter includes many of the most common ships
found across the Third Imperium, both civilian and
military. Where any of the details in these designs differ
from those found in the Traveller Core Rulebook, the
Referee is free to consider them alternate or variant
designs in the wide expanse of the Third Imperium.

Most of the spacecraft described in this chapter are
considered standard designs. Therefore, the Total
for each ship includes the prices for all components,
and the Purchase Cost includes the 10% discount
if the ship qualifies. For ships that carry small craft,
the Maintenance Cost includes the fees for each
craft carried. Any deviation, customisation or other
changes from the design shown invalidate the discount.
After play begins, Travellers may add to the ship as
normal without affecting the discount, as described in
Customising Ships, page 70.

Deck plans are numbered starting with Deck 1 at the
bottom of the ship and proceeding upward like floors in
a multi-storey building.

The close escort is partially streamlined and can
skim gas giants for fuel. It cannot, however, land
on worlds with atmospheres. To this end, the ship
carries a 20-ton military gig in a docking clamp.
Its high performance and armament give it the

boarding by naval authorities. The three emergency

SLOW PINNACE



Like the slow boat, the slow pinnace trades speed
and raw performance for increased cargo space,
although this craft is based on the traditional pinnace.
As a larger hull, it provides even more cargo carrying

capacity than a slow boat and many are customised
to become troop or vehicle transports, or to serve as
fuel skimmers for larger ships.

HEAVY FIGHTER



The heavy fighter is an attempt to provide a powerful,
fast, agile, armoured and dependable small craft
for space superiority. It has bunking arrangements
for crew comfort, which allow the craft to remain on
duty for days, although the lack of common areas

limits crew endurance and typically dictates patrols of
no more than a week. Only a single gunner position
is listed as the missiles are intended as standoff or
bombardment ordnance, to be fired by the pilot when
not in a dogfight or otherwise occupied.

to world surface. The 50-ton limit on displacement
allows the craft to be deployed on ships possessing

The torpedo boat provides a small and evasive
delivery package for lethal torpedo weapons.
Properly used and defended, torpedo boat
squadrons are a danger to much larger ships. With
its small size and manoeuvrability, it is extremely
difficult to hit and even if several are destroyed en
route to their target, all it takes is a portion of them to
get close enough to do immense damage.

The torpedo boat presented here was deliberately
designed at TL12 so that it can be built and
supported at more shipyards within the Imperium.
More advanced versions of up to TL15 are also
manufactured. Any tonnage gained is usually used to
improve its sensors or store more torpedoes.

The express boat (x-boat) is the key to the Imperial
communication network. The Scout Service maintains
an extensive array of designated routes and supporting
tenders to allow access to nearly every important system
in the empire. The 100-ton x-boat is the fast courier that
carries data and messages between those points.

The scout ship is built for exploration, survey and courier
duties, with many thousands in service throughout
Charted Space. It is an exemplar of a mass-produced
ship in the Third Imperium. Despite the small 100-ton
hull, the Type-S has proven itself a versatile design,
capable of handling a wide range of missions. Common
minor modifications include enhancing the filtration
systems by adding biospheres, placing beam lasers in
the turret and installing laundry and a galley (four tons
of common areas) in the cargo hold. Many substantial

revisions have become their own ship classes, such

listed, it is often crewed by a single pilot/astrogator, as
the only person aboard, or carrying other Travellers
with no ship skills. When extra Travellers need
crew positions to give them something to do, they
are typically assigned as gunner (if the turret has
weapons), engineer, sensor operator, medic, steward
or marine, in that order of priority.

A variation on the traditional scout/courier, the seeker is
occasionally produced in this configuration by shipyards
but it is more commonly a refitted old scout retired
from active service. A seeker has fewer staterooms
and a smaller fuel tank but its larger cargo bay and
prospecting buggy allow a single well-skilled prospector
to scavenge asteroids and make a living looking for

SEEKER MINING SHIP **TYPE:J**

deposits of valuable minerals. While Seekers can
be operated by a lone pilot/astrogator, most include
additional crew in order to mine and process ore
at a faster rate. This variant of the seeker forgoes
the use of mining drones, replacing them with a
prospecting buggy, used to rove a mining crew on
the exterior of asteroids.

PROSPECTING BUGGY



The prospecting buggy is a simple, venerable tool of
miners across the Third Imperium. Standard practice is to
transport three miners, possibly with strength-enhancing
exoskeletons and carrying portable laser drills to a loca-tion, fold away the passenger seats (increasing cargo
space to 1.5 tons total), then use the buggy to ferry ore be-tween the mining site and a base camp (typically a Type-J
seeker or ore-processing facility). The crane is equipped

with short-range gravitic plates and a gripping claw
to scoop up loose ore quickly, whether planetside or
in space, with sufficient articulation to deposit it into
the buggy. Skilled pilots often use the buggy’s gravitic
plating to speed up loading and unloading. Unlike
prior generations of buggies, the modern version is
not vacuum-sealed, instead relying on the crew to
wear appropriate environmental protection.

While nominally a modified free trader, the far
trader has a series of modifications that have
become accepted as standard and many free
traders are either modified to this specification or
are built this way from new. The far trader swaps
cargo space and low berths for a larger jump drive
and fuel tank, allowing it to reach systems a basic
free trader cannot travel to. While less cargo can

FAR TRADER **TYPE:A2 (HERO CLASS)**

mean fewer profits, the ability to reach more distant
systems and to travel between stars at a faster rate
can more than make up for this in the hands of a
clever captain. Due to its tight power budget, the ship
must shut down its manoeuvre drive and engage in
‘jump dimming’ – dimming the lights and otherwise
briefly powering off some systems – to have enough
power to jump.

Using a 200-ton hull, the free trader is an elementary
interstellar merchant ship designed to ply the
space lanes while carrying a mixture of cargo and
passengers. It is the archetypal tramp freighter
and common among adventuring groups and
mercenary bands, often retrofitted with turrets,
weapons and other ‘special’ modifications. As such,

FREE TRADER **TYPE:A (BEOWULF CLASS)**

actual specifications can vary wildly, often being
proportional to the age of the ship but the free trader
presented here is typical of a vessel fresh out of the
shipyard. A steward and a medic are recommended
to take care of high and low passengers, respectively,
but are not strictly required.

Although at first appearance uniquely specialised,
the safari ship is relatively common throughout the
galaxy. It is primarily designed as an excursion vessel,
capable of conducting trophy-taking expeditions (photographic or real) to distant worlds, all in a high
degree of comfort. Indeed, some owners will outfit
their safari ship to higher standards of luxury than
many yachts. Included are two eight-ton holding tanks
with variable environments for live specimens and

SAFARI SHIP **TYPE:K (ANIMAL CLASS)**

a trophy lounge that makes for a very comfortable
mess area for passengers and crew. While the ship is
streamlined and can land on the surface of a planet, a
launch and ATV enable expeditions without requiring
the whole vessel to leave orbit. Additional crew, such
as a steward and a medic, are often brought along
to facilitate safaris but are not needed for basic ship
operation. Descriptions of the ATV and air/raft can be
found in the Vehicle Handbook.

The range of possible system defence boat (SDB)
configurations is huge, if not actually infinite.
This example is typical for TL15 systems; heavily
armoured and equipped with both missile and laser
weaponry. Its function is to operate within a star
system and defend it from invading forces. SDBs
can be used in space combat against starships or
they may be pressed into service as air and orbital
superiority craft in operations against ground forces.

SYSTEM DEFENCE BOAT



Because SDBs have no jump drives, shifting them
from system-to-system can be a problem. Some
have jump shuttles which attach themselves to the
boat and provide jump capability. Another method
is simple transport in larger ships; the SDBs are
loaded into 10,000- or 20,000-ton bulk carriers for
the multi-parsec journey.

Jump shuttles fill an important need: They enable
the transportation of ships incapable of jump such as
system defence boats and in-system bulk haulers,
as well as the recovery of disabled starships from
systems lacking repair facilities. Jump shuttles are
usually little more than drives, fuel and the minimum
crew and facilities necessary to run them.

An outdated design meant to be built cheaply and
in great numbers, hundreds of Gazelle-class close
escorts remain in service in the Imperial Navy, despite
the fact that in a combat situation, they are nearly
worthless. The close escort, even when new, was
not intended to stand up to combat vessels; rather it
was envisioned as an anti-piracy and revenue patrol

pressed into combat duties it has invariably suffered
disproportionate losses.

With 80-ton drop tanks (costing MCr 2) installed, the
ship is capable of Jump-4 and Thrust 4. Jettisoning the
drop tanks just before jump allows Jump-5; with internal
tankage only, Jump-3 and Thrust 5 can be achieved
.

**FLEET COURIER**

With communications limited to the speed of jump,
the most difficult operational problem confronting fleet
commanders is the transmission and receipt of timely
intelligence reports and command directives. The
fleet courier is intended to provide naval commanders
with the capability of transmitting orders and
information across subsector distances in relatively
short periods of time. Early versions of this ship were
fitted with jump-6 drives. This model abandons the
jump-6 of its predecessor in order to make better
time jump after jump, as the prior version required

can usually conduct turnaround in three days or less

The Fleet Courier is equipped with purely defensive
weaponry, designed to encourage its captains to

it is intended. The ship has an extra stateroom for
occasions when it carries an important passenger,
such as a courier or official.

The survey scout is a peaceful vessel, typically
unarmed and inoffensive. It does, however, mount
four hardpoints and can be armed with a variety of
turrets and weaponry if necessary. The Donosev-class
is named for famous scouts in the Imperial service. It
often carries a Fuel Skimmer module for its Cutter to
allow wilderness refueling.

The term boat means a non-starship, whether a gunboat,
a ship’s boat or a system defence boat. Because non-starships can allocate more tonnage to power plants and
weaponry, they can usually defeat a starship of equal
tonnage. From this principle, the concept of the system
defence boat has evolved. Fleets of such boats are
stationed in important systems and charged with their
defence. From stations in orbit, they defend the primary
world. From stations deep within the local gas giant,

they attack enemy ships in the process of refuelling. In
extreme situations, they can scatter and hide, in asteroid
belts, on airless worlds and in the depths of oceans; later
they strike out again, hitting the enemy from the rear or
when least expected.

Finally, such system defence boats are also used for
routine duties such as customs inspections, piracy
suppression and search and rescue.

A tool of corsairs and pirates throughout the Third Imperium and beyond,
the Nishemani is infamous for devouring 100 ton ships whole and
delivering them to criminal starports for refurbishing into ships that cannot
be identified as the originals. This is among the grandest (as measured in
Megacredits) sustained theft operations in modern times. All major polities
have issued destroy-on-identification orders for this ship class, making
it a small wonder that there exist enough ships to make a class. The
Nishemani counters this by being able to transform and disguise itself as a
wide variety of innocent 400-ton classes, primarily traders.

Its cargo bay and docking space are combined, with cargo secured when
it comes time to open the bay wide and take in a ship. Docking operations
are only rated for taking in ships up to 100 tons.

Theories abound as to who designed and distributed the blueprints for
this class but whoever did it was clearly going for a purpose-built pirate
ship. The manoeuvre drives are just strong enough to overtake most
unarmed merchant ships. The turrets, despite being built to handle triple
weapons, come with single weapons and extra space. The rated crew
positions list ‘thugs’ where any decent ship would list ‘marines’. The low
berths, while of acceptable grade, are laid out to rack and stow unfortunate
crew and passengers of the victim ships, whether to ransom or sell them
as slaves, although their value is almost always secondary to that of the
stolen ship. Even after fencing a stolen ship, paying off sponsors and so
on, a Nishemani’s 10 crew can each look forward to receiving a significant
fraction of a Megacredit for each successful raid. This has spurred enough
pirate activity that many suspect the true purpose of this design is to
destabilise the Third Imperium’s lifeblood of trade.

At one point it was feared there were almost a million of this ship in Imperial
space, enough to gain the Type-P moniker. Subsequent studies suggest
that there are merely hundreds (despite eradication efforts), which is
still more than uncoordinated individual efforts should have been able to
produce. So far as can be told, no single yard makes enough of these to
take advantage of mass production efficiencies.

The three-parsec jump capability commands higher
passenger and freight fees, and allows less desirable
ports to be bypassed. Although the hull of the ship
itself is only partially streamlined, a launch allows
passengers to be ferried to the surface of a world or
act as a lifeboat in emergencies.

The mercenary cruiser is built to carry small troop units for corporate,
governmental or, more commonly, mercenary operations. It has enough
space to carry a combat platoon of 30, plus crew and support personnel,
along with their equipment, albeit in fairly cramped confines. The platoon
can be deployed to a planet’s surface via the two modular cutters housed
inside the ship. Two spare cutter modules can be carried in addition to those
installed on the cutters, providing greater versatility in missions, although
changing modules requires a delicate dance of launch, release, recovery
and transfer of modules that can take up to an hour. Turrets are fitted as
standard but neither weapons nor cutter modules are included, allowing
maximum owner customisation, and it is a rare mercenary cruiser that is not
armed to the teeth. A luxury stateroom is reserved for the ship’s owner.

A common loadout for the cutters might be two Vehicle modules with AFVs,
a Cargo module and a Fuel Skimmer module. A better-financed mercenary
unit might instead have an Assault boat module, a Gunship module with a
Lynx Fast Assault Tank, a Vehicle module with a Liberator G/Carrier and a
Cargo module.

The Express Boat Network would not work without
the express boat tender. These tenders, stationed in
each system that express boats stop at, serve two
purposes. First, they tend express boats, recovering
them when they arrive, refuelling them and repairing
minor problems, and then sending them on their
way. Second, they serve as a relay station between
the planetary surface-based message centre and
the express boat itself. Messages are forwarded to
the tender for transmittal to the x-boat just before it
leaves for the next star system.

X-BOAT TENDER **CLASS:XT**

Express boat tenders are encountered anywhere
that x-boats are expected. High-population, high-technology systems probably have several tenders
operating in order to handle the flow of information.
Express boat tenders are jump-capable and each
may carry up to four x-boats in their cavernous
ship bays. As a result, the tenders can be found in
fringe or off-route systems ferrying extra x-boats to
areas that need them. They also undertake recovery
missions to pick up damaged x-boats or boats that
have misjumped to off-route systems.

The Chrysanthemum destroyer escort is a small, fast
vessel intended for fleet and squadron escort duties.
The design is old, but efficient, with examples of the
ship serving in the Imperial Navy for over a century.
Chrysanthemums are ubiquitous, being encountered
with larger fleet elements as much as working alone.

During the height of the Third Frontier War (979
to 986), high losses in civilian shipping and
among transport vessels impressed into Imperial
service resulted in the issuance of an Admiralty
specification for a mid-sized escort vessel expressly
for close protection of unarmed transport craft. The
design which was finally accepted was the Fer-de-lance destroyer escort.

DESTROYER ESCORT **CLASS: FER-DE-LANCE**

Performance characteristics for this class make it
capable of staying with most Imperial fleets and
thus this type of vessel can be found escorting most
squadrons as well as more typical convoys.

**KINUNIR**

**COLONIAL**

**CRUISER**

The Kinunir colonial cruiser (also known by a variety of designations: vanguard
cruiser, battlecruiser and vanguard escort) is more of a fast armed troop
transport than a true cruiser. It is an ill-fated model, discontinued after a
production run of only 20. Several have been lost in action. One has been
converted into an orbital prison.

Its true purpose was as an experimental platform, which helped the class
gain access to black globe generators that are usually reserved for much
larger ships. More than one was fitted with an experimental AI, which can be
represented by adding a secondary Computer 35/bis (using ‘bis’ for Conscious
Intelligence rather than Jump Control) that only runs the TL16 version of
Conscious Intelligence, adding MCr70 to the price and Cr5833 to the monthly
maintenance. These AIs worked poorly enough that they help explain why this
model was ill-fated.

The design attempts to serve many missions at once, none well, with 10
marines each assigned for boarding actions, meteoric assault and mechanised
deployment plus a four-marine command section on the air/raft, leaving one
marine on the ship as a liaison. In practice, it was rare to have immediate use
for more than one role at a time, so using a trio of modified ship’s boats that
could serve all roles and training the marines for all missions would have been
superior. Some ship-design libraries include the Kinunir as an example of what
not to do in this regard.

Virtual gunners crew the screens and missiles, one virtual gunner replacing
both crew positions for each installation. Live gunners crew the barbettes,
where higher skill is more useful. The marines are counted as basic
passengers, needing neither officer nor steward crew positions, as they have
no function aboard the ship. Not enough Kinunirs were produced to qualify for
mass production discounts, although their pinnaces did, so the discounted cost
is listed here.

MERCHANT CRUISER **CLASS: LEVIATHAN**

The Leviathan was developed from previous designs
and is primarily intended for independent cruising in
undeveloped trade areas; high survivability is also a
design factor. The vessels are partially streamlined,
allowing wilderness refuelling operations as well
as landings in Atmospheres 0 and 1. Atmospheric

landings are otherwise not recommended, hence
the large complement of small craft. The energy-efficient weapons allow all primary systems except
the fuel processor to be run simultaneously should
the ship be faced with combat. A luxury stateroom is
maintained for the owner-aboard when present.

The Al Morai corporation maintains a fleet of 53 type
MK Mora cargo carriers (not enough to receive the
discount for standard designs), plying fixed routes of
select Class A and B starports throughout the Spinward
Marches, armed and accompanied by surplus Gazelle
close escorts as deterrents to piracy. Generally named
for systems along the route, these freighters maximise
cargo space by using a cramped bridge, an undersized
power plant that requires dimming ship’s power when

initiating a jump-4, turrets controlled via software and
fuel/cargo containers to maximise cargo on shorter
jumps. Al Morai facilities at each stop supply refined
fuel, so no processors are installed. Two pinnaces for
ferrying of passengers and cargo, and for emergency
use as lifeboats. The ship has 14 rooms for crew (single occupancy for the captain, chief engineer
and medic; double occupancy otherwise) and 30
passenger staterooms.

The Skimkish light carrier is relatively slow fighter
carrier/tender characterised by a variety of
heterogeneous weaponry and a large complement
of heavy fighters. Despite its low Thrust, the ship is a
workman-like machine with a tough armour shell that
enables it to stay in the fight long enough to collect
all of its deployed fighters.

The Imperial Navy does not emphasise carriers as
ships that decide battles, instead pairing carriers
with assault and battle squadrons, along with fleet
tenders. Fighters screen the launching and recovery
of battle riders, while the battle riders themselves,
along with cruisers and dreadnoughts, are used to
destroy enemy ships of the line; the fighters then
ensure they survive recovery operations.

**VALIANT**

**LIGHT CRUISER**

The Valiant light cruiser is a recently introduced
armoured version of a previous class of ships
called the Gionetti, which was named exclusively
for posthumous recipients of the Imperial Starburst
for Extreme Heroism. The Gionetti was capable of
jump-5 but its non-existent armour made it a liability
in fleet actions. The running joke was that its crews
would soon be ‘posthumous’ as well.

The Ghalalk armoured cruiser is a basic fleet
workhorse, undertaking a wide variety of duties
in peacetime and supporting the battle fleets in
war. The 200 marines carried aboard the Ghalalk
constitute a reinforced company, trained in protected
forces operations and capable of orbital assaults
via the included troop transports, if called upon. A
command bridge and extra staterooms are included,

ARMOURED CRUISER **CLASS:GHALALK**

allowing ships of this class to act as flagships for
small fleets on occasion.

The Ghalalk is part of a family of cruisers that
mount interchangeable 2,600-ton ‘pods’ that provide
greater versatility. The Ghalalk mounts four of these
pods and this example includes a typical loadout of
four identical missile pods.

Named for famous battles in Imperial history, the
Arakoine strike cruiser is specifically designed for
ground support and surface bombardment. It has
large missile resources available, as well as both
meson gun and particle accelerator weaponry. The
ship is supported by its large phalanx of fighter craft.

STRIKE CRUISER **CLASS: ARAKOINE**

These fighters are capable of close defence for the
ship and of ground support in combat.

The strike cruiser is not capable of fuel skimming,
relying upon its auxiliaries and escorts for the fuel
scoop process. It does carry on-board fuel purification
plants for the processing of fuel.

Named for famous pre-starflight emperors in ancient
Vilani and Solomani history, the Hadrian battle
rider is a stalwart example of its class: armed and
armoured to the teeth and designed to emerge
victorious over capital ships that are well above its
tonnage. The Hadrian can be deployed by several
classes of battle tender but are most often carried by
the one million-ton Warmonger-class.

BATTLE RIDER **CLASS: HADRIAN**

Once deployed, the Hadrian is designed to do battle
while its tender refuels or seeks refuge among the
fleet. If necessary, the battle rider can skim for fuel
from gas giants and remain in the fight for extended
periods of time.

The Azhanti High Lightning is an obsolete multi-purpose cruiser capable of a variety of different
functions. Most notable is the ship’s high jump (jump-5) capability, which gives it great reactive mobility. It
is this quality that has kept the ship in service in spite
of its inferior agility and weaponry.

FRONTIER CRUISER **CLASS: AZHANTI HIGH-LIGHTNING**

Several examples of the ship have been transferred
to the Scout Service and friendly client states.
Much of the remaining examples of the class were
refurbished to the below specifications and now
serve as frontier cruisers on Imperial borders.

The Atlantic heavy cruiser is typical of the Imperial
designs for such ships: a long flattened structure
studded with weaponry, flaring aft for rudimentary
control surfaces useful for fuel skimming. Well-armed and extremely well-armoured, it fulfils the
basic design requirement of meeting the enemy and
winning in battle.

The Atlantic, however, is fast approaching
obsolescence and is not the equal of more modern
vessels in the Imperium and neighbouring regions.
The slight disadvantage of 5G acceleration is telling
in otherwise equal engagements and make the
class inferior enough to affect strategic judgements
concerning its commitment.

An upgrade program to enhance the class was
considered but decided against because of cost,
although a number of enhanced prototypes have
been reported.

This class of cruiser has lately proven popular with the
Navy for independent missions, especially beyond the
Imperial borders. Used alone, the ships are capable of
a variety of diplomatic and scientific operations. Used
in squadrons, they provide a useful show of force or
reinforcement for friendly client-states.

Reportedly, some examples of the Atlantic have
been fitted with black globe force field generators.
This has not been confirmed.

The Wind strike carrier is a particular artifact of
the escalating tensions in the Spinward Marches.
Designed and created for the transport of light
fighters to the battle front, strike carriers are also well-armed, reasonably armoured and capable of standing
in battle against most enemies.

The Wind is capable of entering enemy-held territory,
either alone or with a small escort and overwhelming
defences by weight of its fighter complement. As
standard, its hangars carry 80 light fighters, although
variants exist capable of launching heavy fighters
or even troop transports. Where the threat level is

deemed sufficiently low, a Wind strike carrier may
jump into a system, launch fighters, then retreat to
a gas giant to refuel while the smaller craft conduct
patrols or limited attacks.

If cornered, the strike carrier is more than capable
of defending itself against enemy vessels smaller
than itself, even if the bulk of its fighters are engaged
elsewhere. A powerful meson spinal mount gives it
sufficient punch against capital ships, while batteries
of missiles, beam lasers, particle beams and fusion
guns provide more than enough firepower to destroy
waves of smaller vessels.

Also known in naval circles as the mother ship,
the fleet carrier is a transport and launch facility
for heavy fighters. In peace, the fleet carrier is a
mobile port and repair facility for its brood; in war, it
is a formidable fleet element to be respected. The
fleet carrier depends on its phalanx of 300 fighters
for the majority of its protection. Typically, one-third

of the fighter force is in flight at any one time. In
addition, the ship can defend itself with its extensive
armament – especially its missile salvos. In practice,
the fleet carrier’s low armour rating and agility make
it vulnerable and clumsy in battle and it will join
combat only to ensure recovery of its brood.

**GALIKA MEGULA**

**FREIGHTER**

The Galika Megula dates back to the late First
Imperium. Most examples in service really are that old,
although many were mothballed for centuries at a time
during the Long Night. Constructing one is a major
affair involving multiple shipyards for over 10 years.

These freighters were originally designed to promote
Vilani mercantile interests to ‘barbarian’ homeworlds

that could sustain high volumes of trade but could
not be trusted to maintain good starports, thus the
ability to conduct wilderness refuelling if necessary,
unusual among more modern freighters. At the time,
jump-2 showcased the height of Vilani technological
superiority. In modern times, these two elements see
it conducting trade along the Imperial frontier, often
the largest ship a world will ever see.

The Kokirrak dreadnought is one of the more common
classes of capital ships in service in the Spinward
Marches; a total of four BatRons of this type serve
on permanent station, with harbour assignments at
Rhylanor, Regina, Jewell and Mora. Generally, one
squadron of Kokirraks is dispersed into independent
ships with ancillary escorts. On patrol, the ships
combine training operations with routine patrols and
reaction operations.

The Kokirrak is a preferred ship for flagship operations
due to its extensive admiral’s quarters, which include
command and communications equipment, as well

DREADNOUGHT **CLASS:KOKIRRAK**

as entertainment chambers. The ship is capable of
controlling a large fleet engagement within a system,
as well as holding its own in battle; the combination
of fleet controller and line-of-battle ship makes it an
asset in nearly any space combat situation.

The Kokirraks are one of the older classes of
dreadnoughts in Imperial service and are now being
phased out of service. Within the last decade, several
ships have been disposed of to other services, such
as the scouts, and to other governments, including
sector navies and client-states in the Spinward border
regions of the Imperium.

The Plankwell dreadnought is a more specialised
ship than the multi-task oriented Tigress-class.
Lacking the large fighter screen, the Plankwell fulfils
a more traditional battleship role, as the centre of a
fleet of supporting ships.

For decades, the Imperial Fleet in the Spinward
Marches has included at least one BatRon of
Plankwell ships but recently (1102), the last such
squadron was rotated to the strategic reserve in
Corridor Sector. Sentiment in Naval and Sector

DREADNOUGHT **CLASS:PLANKWELL**

circles runs high in favour of the return of at least
one BatRon to the Marches.

Plankwell dreadnoughts are named for notable
admirals in the Imperial Navy. The class name is
taken from Grand Admiral Olav hault-Plankwell, a
sector admiral in the Spinward Marches who rose to
Grand Admiral of the Marches and lead the defeat of
the Outworld Coalition during the First Frontier War (589 to 604). Following his victory in 604, he led the
fleet to the Core, personally dispatched the Empress
Jaqueline I, and took over the government.

Although some older battleships of greater
displacement remain in service, the Tigress
dreadnought is the largest line-of-battle vessel
currently in service with the Imperial Navy in the
Spinward Marches. Each BatRon of Tigress-class
vessels is virtually a fleet unto itself, as each ship
carries 30 squadrons of heavy fighters (with 10 FHs
per squadron). A BatRon of eight ships carries 2,400
heavy fighters.

At present, only one Tigress BatRon is deployed in
the Spinward Marches, assigned to 212th Fleet, at
Rhylanor. Additional Tigress BatRons are generally
assigned one per sector.

Within the sphere, layered decks hold the various
on-ship functions such as quarters, computer
and electronic equipment, fuel treatment and
maintenance areas. Appended to the back of the
sphere is a large heavy fighter launch and recovery
installation. Fighters are launched to the rear, to
starboard, and recovered from the rear, to port; this
arrangement prevents them from entering the meson
beam when it is in use, as well as providing some
armoured bulk between the fighters and the enemy.

Note all the software cannot run at its full rating
together. What is running is determined by the needs of
the crew at a given time. A full crew is carried but virtual
software may be used, if necessary, due to losses.
