## CIVILIAN SHIPS

This section is devoted to mercantile ships and merchant vessels
that travel throughout the galaxy hauling cargo and money from
one system to another in search of profi t. Often armed, but with
rarely enough weaponry to give raiders pause, these ships rely upon
escorts or naval patrols to remain safe in dangerous space.

## CRIMINAL VESSELS

Just as there are criminals that operate planetside there are those
who operate in the spacelanes. Pirates and smugglers are dangerous,
and both have access to some powerful designs. Although many
pirate and smuggler ships are little more than converted merchant
vessels, there are some specifi cally designed for those roles. Less
overtly criminal, but often crossing the line between legal and illegal,
salvage ships can be used by those who rescue ships damaged or
destroyed by the everyday hazards of space travel. There are many
of these ships operating in areas strewn with the debris of old space
battles, and scavenging from these drifting graveyards is both
profi table and frequently forbidden.

## AUXILIARIES

Navies have to rely on more than just warships. There are many tasks
that need to be fulfi lled besides front line duties, and the auxiliaries
in this section cover those in use. Without these and other similar
vessels, the navy would fi nd itself unable to perform its duties.

## SYSTEM DEFENCE SHIPS

System Defence Boats (SDBs) pack a powerful punch for their
tonnage and are a good, cheap way to bolster a planet’s defences.
Some larger ships are also listed, these being designed to support
SDBs but, being jump capable, are able to fulfi l other roles.

## WARSHIPS

These vessels serve a variety of military roles. Although none are
large enough for front line duty, they are capable war machines
regardless. Dealing with pirates and raiders, as well as manning
border patrols and guarding civilian traffi c, these ships are far
more likely to be encountered than the far larger capital ships of
the navy.

# IINTRODUCTIONNTRODUCTION

Space travel is a large part of the Traveller universe, with weeks,
months or even years being spent living in one spaceship or the
next. Vessels that travel through the void of space are the reason
some careers exist, entire industries are based around the creation
and manufacture of spacecraft, and some people make it their
lives’ work to fl y them. Simply put – spacecraft are as important in
Traveller as the people who crew them.

They are also just as diverse. There are spacecraft designed for all
walks of life in Traveller, many of which are specially suited for their
tasks and should be crewed by those who understand what the task
entails. For every task or service in the universe, someone has likely
put together a space vessel of some kind to help make it easier to
perform.

This book is a collection of ships that can be found throughout the
Traveller universe. Some will be familiar to older fans of the setting,
many are new renditions of old ideas, and others will be completely
new. They were all designed using the ship design rules found in the
Traveller core rulebook and Traveller Book 2: High Guard.

The ships are divided into the following sections:

## DRONES

Small unmanned craft often carried by larger vessels. These small
craft perform a wide variety of tasks, but are often viewed as
expendable.

## SMALL CRAFT - CIVILIAN

This section contains smaller vessels that range in size up to
100 d-tons. Essential for operations in space, these craft are the
workhorses of the Traveller universe, unglamorous but essential.

## SMALL CRAFT - MILITARY

Small, non-jump capable craft designed for purely military use. Agile
fi ghters, small landing craft, ship to ship assault boats and bombers

- all are well represented in this section.

## COUNTERMEASURE DRONE

Countermeasure drones are advanced computerized automatons deployed in small numbers to foil the sensors of scanning vessels.
They are not large, but contain powerful jamming sensors that act much like the countermeasure suite of larger ships, though at shorter
ranges.

The countermeasure drone may actively jam the sensors of any ship within Short range. The drone must pass a Comms test as normal
to jam the ship (as per the rules on page 53 of the Traveller core rulebook), but does so with a +2 DM to the check instead of the normal
penalties. The countermeasure drone is a Technology Level 13 design.

## SUICIDE DRONE

Suicide drones are powerful engines in a streamlined, spike-like chassis, fi tted with a single bomb-pumped torpedo warhead. The drone is
launched and its automated systems direct it to the target, driving deep into its hull before detonating. Like a guided, intelligent missile,
the drone seeks the best route to its target, effectively evading incoming attacks like a fi ghter until it can impact – destroying itself in the
process. Suicide drones are sometimes thought of as too expensive to use in high numbers, but some navies make use of them. The suicide
drone is a Technology Level 12 design.

## MINE DRONE

A mine drone is a simple, lightly armored shell powered by a fast engine that propels a single powerful explosive charge. When deployed it
maneuvers to position and waits for a target that gives off electromagnetic impulses. When the target gets close enough the mine drone
rockets towards it and detonates.

Any target with a non-chemical power plant that comes within Adjacent Range of a dormant mine drone will automatically activate the
drone’s attack sequence. The mine moves toward the target at full speed, before detonating against it with a damage rating equal to that of
a High-Yield Multi-Warhead Missile. The mine drone is a Technology Level 12 design.

## RECONNOISSANCE DRONE

Recon drones are often used by scout ships fi rst entering an unknown or potentially hostile system. They are little more than small
compact mapping computers and sensor software suites attached to a long-ranged fuel supply. The recon drone is launched and sent on
an automated sweep of the system, returning with invaluable planetary and stellar data for the scout ship to analyse. The recon drone is a
Technology Level 12 design.

## FREIGHT HANDLER POD

Used by traders, delivery services and orbital ports, the freight handler pod is similar in nature to a maintenance pod, but is designed for the
manoeuvring of multiple cargo containers. The unique ‘double grapple’ system of the freight handler allows the pilot to push one grappled
object forward while also tugging a second behind, making them useful in offl oading or placement of large quantities of cargo. The freight
handler pod is a Technology Level 11 design.

## BUSINESS SHUTTLE/YACHT

The yacht is a small pleasure craft used for interplanetary transport or slow cruises using its solar sails. It is often used by businessmen
who take the yacht out on small, personal cruises, but also need the option to use the craft as to ferry small numbers of personnel or cargo
between sites in-system. This makes the yacht very popular, since the cost can be applied to the accounts of a company and helps reduce
its tax burden. The business shuttle/yacht is a Technology Level 9 design.

## SPACE CONTROL ROUTER, SHEPHERD-CLASS

The Shepherd-class control router is a small vessel fi lled with state-of-the-art computer and sensor technology used to serve as traffi c
controller for an entire planetary system. Able to keep track of dozens of individual signals at once, the Shepherd is most often purchased
and used by transit authorities and civilian space-travel hubs. It sits in empty space and monitors space traffi c, its small crew keeping up
with the automated commands the computer emits for incoming traffi c. The space control router is a Technology Level 13 design.

## COVERT INSERTION CRAFT, TYPE XI

Converting a standard pinnace into a spy craft, the design of the Type XI covert insertion craft adds powerful stealth and sensor technology
that allows the ship to move more or less unseen through space and planetary defences. Expensive to build, it is used to deliver covert
teams or VIPs to their destinations without being detected, allowing a private landing unmolested by hostile forces. The covert insertion
craft is a Technology Level 13 design.

## MODULAR SKIFF

The modular skiff is primarily used around starports or space stations to serve multiple vehicular roles without using excessive hangar
space. Just switching out the 20 ton modular central platform can allow the skiff to serve a variety of functions. Changing the module is an
Easy (+4 DM) Intelligence- based Engineer (any) or Mechanic check requiring 1 – 6 hours. Unlike the modular cutter, the central platform is
accessible only in dry dock through the external airlock or in space by going EVA. The modular skiff is a Technology Level 11 design.

## RETRIEVAL BOAT

Much like a common ship’s boat, the retrieval boat is used almost solely for the emergency rescue of evacuated crewmen and ejected life
boats from hazardous areas. It is armored and shielded against secondary explosions or burning fuel, allowing the boat to sail into a
hazardous site to use its grapple and deposit items into its sizeable airlock. The retrieval boat is a Technology Level 11 design.

## SHIP TO SHIP SHUTTLE, TYPE XSX

Smaller than the standard atmospheric shuttle, the Type XSX is designed for short trips between ships in orbit. It is not built for speed or
protection, but for ease of use and simplistic controls that almost any non-barbarian can pilot.
Because of the design pattern of the controls in the cabin, there is a +1 DM bonus to characters using the Pilot (small craft) skill to pilot
this shuttle. This means even an untrained pilot will only have a –2 DM penalty instead of the normal –3 DM. The ship to ship shuttle is
a Technology Level 11 design.

## SLOW BOAT

The slow boat is a cheap alternative for the Ship’s Boat, performing many of the same roles but with a far lower cost and poorer
performance. Where budgets are tight or speed is not essential, the slow boat will often be used instead of more capable vessels. The
slow boat is a Technology Level 8 design.

## SPACE SURVEILLANCE CRAFT

Where images of potential landing zones or information within an area of space are required, this high-tech surveillance craft is a favorite
of task forces. It incorporates dozens of small cameras and sensors into its nose cone, all which feed data into the central signal processor
for download upon the craft’s return to the host carrier or base. The space surveillance craft is a Technology Level 11 design.

## SLOW PINNACE

The slow pinnace is a design in common use amongst corporations who shuttle staff and small amounts of cargo between off-world
facilities. A cheaper design than the standard pinnace this vessel is mostly used where short runs are required or when those operating it
have limited funds. The lack of passenger facilities makes it a vessel not suited for the transport of paying customers. The slow pinnace
is a Technology Level 8 design.

## SOLAR SAILING YACHT

A pleasure craft often used by merchants or industrialists wishing to tour a system at their leisure, this yacht is not built for speed but
for sight-seeing on an extra-planetary scale. When deployed, the yacht’s solar sail is roughly triangular and metallic white in colour. Some
privately-owned solar yachts give up some of their cargo space for small point defence weaponry to dissuade pirates or hijackers, but most
owners accept they are too un-manoeuvrable for combat. The solar sailing yacht is a Technology Level 11 design.

## ANTIQUE FIGHTER

Not much to look at, few pilots would go out of their way to fl y an antique fl yer, but having some kind of fi ghter screen is better than none at
all. This entry covers several individual types of antique fi ghter, such as the old Belter Moray-class, the long decommissioned Imperial Type

## JUNK FIGHTER

The junk fi ghter is a hobbled together attack craft, little more than a fuselage and drive system wrapped around a starship-grade pulse
laser. They are extremely fragile and easily thwarted by higher technology craft, but can pose a signifi cant threat when deployed in great
numbers.

Because of the serious issues involved in the haphazard way junk ships are patched together, all skill checks involving the operation of
hardware built into a junk ship suffers a –1 DM. The junk fighter is a Technology Level 9 design.

## ORBITAL DEFENCE SYSTEM (ODS)

Deployed in orbit around an important installation or planet, the standard ODS is not so much a ship more as a gunnery platform. In the
low technology version shown here it is crewed by a single technician who must stay on station for months at a time, his only company
visits by resupply crews. Although a stateroom is fi tted to ensure some comfort for the crewman, it is still a cramped space to remain within
over a long period of time. Assignment to an ODS is never viewed as a promotion, and many personnel have nicknamed them ‘retirement
pods’.

More conventional automated versions of the ODS have a drone command unit of some form. The orbital defence system is a Technology
Level 11 design.

## STRIKE BOAT

An expensive alternative to the standard torpedo ‘blast boat’, the fast and deadly strike boat is a rare sight, and an unwelcome one for its
enemies. It trades the dual-torpedo rack for a single magnetically-attached launcher, and mounts an advanced pulse laser for use after it
has deployed its payload. The strike boat is a Technology Level 12 design.

## ANTIQUE IN-SYSTEMS HAULER

These old in-systems haulers were replaced by higher-technology freighters and tugs many years ago by most space faring communities,
but can still be found operating in poorer communities. The hauler is used to ferry cargo and small craft from one end of a system to the
other, serving on long trips past planets on their route. They are large, use primitive versions of gravitic drives, and rely on dirty fi ssion
powerplants.

Normal crew is 3 pilots, 2 engineers and a gunner. The antique in-systems hauler is a Technology Level 8 design.

Designed to jump between systems using predetermined paths’, the express boat is a bulbous cockpit barely big enough for one, set in
front of a powerful jump drive. It has no M-drive at all, being reliant upon tenders or tugs to position them before and after each jump.
Delivering important messages from elsewhere on the Express Boat Network, this craft is one of the most important vessels supporting

## MODULAR CLIPPER

A favorite amongst organizations in need of a multi-purpose vessel, the modular clipper comes with a central section that can be changed
depending on the requirements of any mission. Keeping a few specialist mechanics on the crew means the clipper can be ready for a
common trade run or a delivery into hostile territory after just a few hours of work in a dock or starport. Typical modules range from 25
to 200 tons in size, but there is virtually no limit on what can carried within the modular space. On at least one occasion, an enterprising
captain has carried several system defence boats, converting her ship into a mini-battletender. While there are several versions of this craft
in existence, this one has a relatively short range and is designed to operate as a freighter on a fi xed route. Other vessels have a higher jump
capability, sacrifi cing cargo space in order to be able to reach more isolated systems.

Normal crew consists of the captain, executive offi cer, 2 pilots, navigator, 3 engineers, 4 small craft crew, medic and 16 gunners. The
modular clipper is a Technology Level 12 design.

## ANIMAL-CLASS SAFARI SHIP

Designed and used by galactic entrepreneurs, the Animal-class safari ship is an atmospheric lander that takes high-paying passengers to
frontier worlds to fi nd and hunt rare animals. The Animal-class is built with a pair of retractable anti-personnel turrets to discourage hostiles
from approaching the ship while landed. Whether they are shooting from the attached hunting deck or from ports on the ship’s ATV, safari-
goers can be protected while hunting their quarry. The environment of the ship’s cargo space can be modifi ed to a wide range of conditions,
including salt water, extreme temperatures or unusual atmospheres so animals can be captured for sale to zoos or private collectors.

Normal crew is a pilot, navigator, engineer and a gunner. The safari ship is a Technology Level 11 design.

## PIRATE RAIDER (AMBUSH FRIGATE)

One of the most feared gunboats in space, the Pirate Raider is sometimes known as the Ambush Frigate, for its ability to sit motionless
for many days running on solar panel-driven power, awaiting a target. Activating its engines, it can bring several weapon systems to bear
quickly. It is very attractive to pirates, privateers and any navy looking for an effi cient commerce raider. Although not designed to engage
warships, it has a decent offensive capability – especially when engaging an unwary opponent. Normal crew consists of the captain, pilot,
navigator, 3 engineers and 6 gunners. The pirate raider is a Technology Level 12 design.

## ARMED FAST SMUGGLER

This is a general classifi cation of fast vessel, designed to move illicit cargo, be it freight or sentient, through protected or blockaded space
without local or Imperial interference. They vary slightly from model to model, with weaponry suited to deal with local threats or potential
hazards, although some smugglers modify their vessels so they are almost unrecognizable from the original design. Smugglers choose to
use this style of ship when they cannot hide their goods on a normal cargo hauler, or if they might need to lurk around on solar power for a
few days to preserve fuel or avoid troublesome scans.

Normal crew consists of a pilot, navigator, 2 engineers and 2 gunners/stewards. The armed fast smuggler is a Technology Level 11

## PIRATE CRUISER (CUTLASS-CLASS)

Large and powerful for a pirate vessel, most raiding fl eets rarely have access to a cruiser due to their extreme expense and maintenance.
Those who can afford to buy and keep a cruiser of this calibre are the source of fear and terror in their local space lanes. The most popular
of these cruisers is the Cutlass-class, made by dubious shipbuilding concerns who build them for ‘private escort companies’. Normal crew
consists of a captain, pilot, navigator, 3 engineers, 6 gunners, 2 fi ghter pilots and 20 “marines”. The pirate cruiser is a Technology Level

## LABOURER-CLASS SALVAGE HAULER

Once the vultures and their probes have found salvage, scrap and reclamation companies send in the Labourers to scavenge what the
smaller ships could not. With a large hold and numerous external clamps, the Labourer can carry well over its tonnage in additional
salvaged hulls – although at a much reduced speed of travel.

The Docking Clamps of the Labourer-class Salvage Hauler can hold the hulks of multiple craft up to the limit of the clamps, and do not have
any airlock or entry access for the ships they are holding.

Normal crew consists of the captain, pilot, navigator, 3 engineers and 4 gunners. The salvage hauler is a Technology Level 12 design.

## VULTURE-CLASS ARMED SALVAGE SHIP

The salvage business is very lucrative, especially on the edges of contested space. ‘Junkers’ make their living fl ying these unattractive ships
into former war zones or gravitic collection points, looking for interstellar remains and grabbing as much as they can in their relatively small
vessels. The Vulture-class ships are not the prime movers for salvage companies, but they serve the role of scout and preliminary samplers
of what could be the next big haul.

The Docking Clamp of the Vulture-class Armed Salvage Ship can hold the broken remains of multiple craft up to the limit of the clamp, and
does not have any airlock or entry access for the ships they are holding.

The normal crew consists of the pilot, navigator, 2 engineers and 2 gunners. The armed salvage ship is a Technology Level 12 design.

## LIGHT ASSAULT TRANSPORT

Although most orbital assaults are conducted by regiments, brigades or even divisions, there is a need for smaller forces, be it a commando
mission, deep penetration raid or hostage rescue. For these missions the light assault transport is ideal. It has high performance for a
transport vessel, and can carry a company of ground assault marines, able to deploy them by assault shuttle or re-entry capsule.

The crew consists of the captain, executive offi cer, comms offi cer, medic, 2 pilots, navigator, 6 small craft crew and 16 gunners. The
embarked ground assault company has 122 marines organised as a command section of 10 and 3 platoons of 28.

Re-entry capsule launchers can launch one capsule every 30 seconds, take up 1 ton, store one capsule and costs Cr 10,000. Additional
launch-ready capsules take up 0.5 tons and cost Cr 1,000 per capsule. The light assault transport is a Technology Level 14 design.

The re-entry capsules come in three versions:
Basic (Cr 2,000 TL8). Basic re-entry capability and personnel compartment only. Little more capable than a rescue capsule.
Assault (Cr 10,000 TL11). Adds extensive ECM, chaff and is armored (value 20 against ground weapons).
High Survivability (Cr50,000 TL14). Is even more heavily armored (30), carries six decoys and is capable of evasive maneuver.

## Q-SHIP

Used almost exclusively by merchant marines and planetary navies, the Q-Ship is a heavily armed mercantile vessel that falls somewhere-
between trader and escort. It carries a squad of security personnel along with a small amount of cargo, making the Q-Ship perfect to
ferry items and goods that require extra protection. What makes this vessel particularly dangerous to pirates is that it appears to normal
scanning as a subsidized merchant (including a fake launch) and its weapons are hidden in pop-up turrets. For added combat effectiveness
fi ghter drones are occasionally used, replacing the ship’s boat.
The crew consists of a captain, pilot, navigator, 2 engineers, 4 gunners/stewards and 10 security personnel. The Q-ship is a Technology
Level 11 design.

## MINESWEEPER, TYPE M/R

The use of space mines in Red Zone travel routes can be a danger for fl eets and convoys through them, requiring the use of minesweepers.
Minesweepers are equipped with sensitive probes to fi nd active mines, accurate weaponry to destroy them, and heavy armor to cope with
impacts from undetected mines. They are not built for speed or agility, just simple endurance and effi ciency.

Normal crew is the pilot, navigator, 2 engineers and 3 gunners. The minesweeper is a Technology Level 13 design.

## SECURITY PURSUIT SHIP

Prison planets or stations do not often suffer from successful escapes, but they do happen; one answer is this fast patrol vessel intercepting
the escaped prisoners’ ship. The security pursuit ship can bring its particle beams and lasers to bear quickly, and can locate quarry whether
they are fl eeing into space or hiding on a planet’s surface, with the liberal use of probe drones.

Normal crew consists of a pilot, navigator, 2 engineers, 3 gunners and 10 marshals. Recaptured prisoners are held in low berths or
temporary barracks in the hold. The security pursuit ship is a Technology Level 12 design.

## DEFENCE FRIGATE

The defence frigate is a favorite amongst subsector navies, able to bolster a system’s defence at short notice. It is designed with low jump
capability in order to maximise performance in other areas. Its primary duties are in a policing role, dealing with opportunistic pirates,
smugglers and raiders. In times of war, it will operate as an escort to supply convoys, acting in concert with larger vessels from the fl eet.
Whilst not as manoeuvrable as an SDB and lacking the jump capability to keep pace with fl eet units, the defence frigate is still an effective
vessel. They work very well in concert with fi ghter support squadrons and SDBs, allowing the frigate to engage larger targets while its
escorts mop up minor enemy craft. Its onboard hangar space normally holds fi ghters, but can also be used to house a variety of other
craft if desired. The normal crew is the captain, pilot, navigator, 3 engineers, 8 gunners and 6 small craft crew. The defence frigate is a
Technology Level 11 design.

Built using older techniques that would put crews in space for lengthy periods of time, this class of gunship is still used in frontier systems,
out-of-the-way planetary pickets and by relatively low-tech planetary navies. Launched into space around an important area that requires

## ASSAULT GUNSHIP, TYPE RG

Fast and reliable, the type RG assault gunship is designed to blast away at targets while readying a platoon of marines for boarding. It can
outshoot many smaller vessels, choosing to bring its deadly row of fusion guns to bear while carving holes in larger targets with its lasers.
Assault gunships are very popular with minor governments, serving on patrols as well as in their designated role of attack craft, but are too
expensive to be used in large numbers except by very wealthy systems.

The crew consists of captain, pilot, navigator, 2 engineers, 4 gunners and 30 Marines. The assault gunship is a Technology Level 12
design.

## COLONIAL CRUISER

The colonial cruiser is designed for patrols, showing the fl ag and conducting small scale intervention operations where larger vessels
would be considered excessive. To perform these functions it has a varied range of weaponry and carries a reinforced marine platoon. Its
extra passenger capacity is often used to carry a small command staff, enabling it to function as a fl agship for small fl otillas. This particular
example, produced at Tech Level 15, is generally considered extremely expensive for its intended mission.

The normal crew consists of a captain, executive offi cer, communications offi cer, medic, 2 pilots, navigator, 4 engineers, 2 small craft crew
and 16 gunners. The embarked marine platoon has 36 troops.
