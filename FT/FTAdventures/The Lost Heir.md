### RUNNING A BULLDOGS! ADVENTURE

There’s something of a trick to running an adventure scenario using the Fate Core system.
This is a brief introduction for GMs like you who are going to present this adventure to
your players.
Unlike a lot of game systems, Fate Core allows players to take a very flexible and often
unpredictable approach to problem solving. For example, a party confronted with a reluc-
tant witness is going to handle the obstacle very differently if it is led by an incorrigible
con artist than if the party is led by a veteran pit fighter.
Because of this, the scenarios that we’re releasing for Bulldogs! present not a step-by-
step plot, but instead a series of challenges called Problems that you, as the GM, use to
confront the players with opposition.
Each Problem includes a situation and possibly some characters that create an obstacle
for the player characters. Guidelines on how to handle some of the more predictable
methods that players use to bypass the Problem are described, such as difficulty numbers
for skill checks, stunts and skills that the non-player characters have, etc.
The key to running Fate Core is flexibility. You need to be ready to roll with what the
players try to do. Players may throw you for a loop by taking a completely unexpected
action, or bypassing the Problem altogether. That’s OK! If the players take you by surprise
and do something nobody anticipated, just set the difficulty for them and let it roll. If the
players bypass a Problem completely, move it to a point later in the session, or just toss it
out completely.
Despite all this, you’ve got a powerful tool in your arsenal to get the players to engage
with a Problem. Grab an aspect on one of the characters confronted by the Problem
and compel it! Players are going to be happy to dig into the complications if they get a
fate point for it. If your players are familiar with Fate Core, they might even do this to
themselves when you put a Problem in their way.

## THE LOST HEIR

The Frontier planet Quellim has been wracked by civil war for a decade, ever since the
last king died without an heir. Now there is someone claiming to be the rightful successor
of the king, but no one is willing to dive into the deadly competing factions to bring her
home. What's a lost heir to do? Hire Class D hazardous shipping to do the job! You've
just got to keep her alive long enough to get the manifest signed for delivery.

#### setuP: APoLLonIA

Built from the fabulously rare, vacuum-proof wood of the Ranian tree, the glittering
gardens, sparkling ballrooms, and luxurious suites of Apollonia are a constant lure for the
wealthy and the dangerous. Ships do not dock with Apollonia; they are instead moored
some distance away, and customers are ferried over in robot-piloted limousines. Apollonia
has a reputation for offering its customers whatever they could possibly want, with the
utmost discretion.

###### THOUSAND-YEAR PARTY

INVOKE: there’s no better place to blow off some steam or impress a mark, “Wait until the
fireworks start!”
COMPEL: you’re not invited, “Excuse me sir, but I wonder if my two large friends might
have a word?”

###### THE FUTURE IS HERE!

INVOKE: the sense of optimism is infectious, “You know, you’re right! This is no obstacle
at all!”
COMPEL: it’s not evenly distributed, “Oh, I just assumed you’d have a quarter million
credits handy...”

#### ProBLeM: GettInG on the stAtIon

Princess Lallas has apartments on Apollonia, her home for the majority of her life. She
is not waiting at the distant shipping berths, she is instead waiting on the station for
pickup. She expects the crew to pick her up along with her extensive baggage. Navigating
the station to her quarters should be relatively easy, but Apollonia is designed to distract
and attract.
The first barrier is the security checkpoint. A truly gorgeous individual in a very sharp
uniform and discreet sidearm stands there, ready to check in visitors. By their side is a
very impressive ivory and gilt robot about 8 feet tall and excessively armed. They will look
at approaching Bulldogs with an expression of mixed disdain and disgust. They will go
over the crew's credentials with a fine-toothed comb, but they do have permission to be
here. All weapons must be checked, however, and the security guard will carefully scan
everyone before letting them past to make sure they aren't holding any back.

#### ProBLeM: teMPtAtIons oF APoLLonIA

Once past the checkpoint, the group is still not in the clear. Any characters with a weak-
ness for luxury, shopping, or gambling (and compellable aspects on theme) are going to
spot something that attracts their fancy as they move through the station. It may be a
relatively depleted group that arrives at the Princess' quarters.
It's ok to split the party here on Apollonia! Apollonia is a satellite of pleasure, and the
environment is specifically designed to have something to tempt everyone. Be bold and
aggressive when compelling aspects during the trip through the luxurious halls. While
the remainder of the crew picks up the Princess, add complications to the situation for
the split characters.

#### ProBLeM: Meet Your cArGo

Princess Lallas will greet them graciously, if a bit condescendingly. She is thrilled to be
traveling with the delightfully seedy Bulldogs, and will let them know it. She is slumming
and loving it. She then directs them to an immense pile of luggage, and takes the captain's
arm (or the highest ranking or handsomest Bulldog available). She's ready to go!
Of course, although she is eager to slum it, Princess Lallas is completely naive to the
ways of the world. She is totally unprepared for how low-class the Bulldogs' facilities and
accommodations are. She expects a high level of pampering and will be bothering the
Bulldogs for luxuries the entire trip. She is also clearly unprepared for the cutthroat reali-
ties of the politics of her home world, something the Bulldogs may or may not care about.

#### ProBLeM: MArKed For deAth

Unfortunately for the crew, an assassin has been sent to deal with Princess Lallas before
she can take her place. A member of the notorious carnivorous Septercian species, the
assassin Keshtrit Kiss-Shik is waiting for the crew to get Lallas out into the main corri-
dors where she can stage an ambush in a crowd. She will use Stealth to approach, but a
Survival roll to overcome it can call on her STEER CLEAR OF SEPTERCIANS species aspect.
Whether or not she is detected, she will dart forward and stab Lallas with one of her
arm spurs as an opening move, and then try to drag the Princess away. A full-on brawl
will set off the alarms and several two-person (an Apollonian and a robot) squads of
Apollonian security will arrive in three rounds. They will target anyone with weapons
first, followed by the most dangerous looking combatant (which very well may be the
Septercian).
Regardless of the outcome of the fight, the security team will be looking to throw
the Bulldogs off-station for starting something, as they will be blamed for the fight no
matter what. If they smuggled any weapons aboard station, they will be expelled with
even more prejudice.

#### setuP: QuILLeM

Quillem is a not-very-important agricultural world, mainly notable as a source of food for
GCP. It is only a short ride away from GCP, just a day or so. The local government has
been in turmoil for some time without an heir to the dead king, a number of prominent
clans are battling to see who gets put on the throne. There is a faction called the Old
Royals that wants Princess Lallas on the throne, but they are smaller in number than the
two major factions, the Luguss and Somol clans.
The majority of the planet itself is full of cultivated fields in step-agriculture on steep
hills. There are several major cities, urban and full of Arsubarans who make up the major-
ity of the local population.

#### ProBLeM: eVerYone In the WAY

Sadly, the Bulldogs aren't the only ones who know that Princess Lallas is on her way back
to the planet. The Luguss and Somol clans have put up a blockade and will pursue any
ship that enters the system without agreeing to boarding and search.
The Luguss clan hired the assassin, and straight up just wants to murder the Princess
to keep her from the throne. Their ships will take a very aggressive stance, and have no
trouble with the idea of blowing the Bulldogs out of the sky.
The Somol clan is more interested in controlling Princess Lallas and using her as a
figurehead for their interests. They will try to disable and board the Bulldogs' ship, or if
that fails attempt to bribe the Bulldogs to hand her over. They have no intention of paying
and will double-cross the Bulldogs if they take them up on their offer.

#### ProBLeM: FALse FLAG

Princess Lallas has arranged for arrival with General Sebastian Hamellin, a member of the
Old Royals. Unbeknowst to the Princess, the General has made a deal to hand her over
to the Somol clan. When he contacts the crew for delivery, he will set the site far from any
city, ostensibly for covert security, but really so he can set a full ambush for the Princess.
As the crew arrive, General Hamellin will come out from the small metal building
that is the only structure in view at the site and wait with a couple of armed soldiers in
Old Royals colors for the Bulldogs to deliver the Princess. In reality, all around them in
hidden positions are Somol clan soldiers, three per crew member. If the crew just hand the
Princess over, all is good. If they get suspicious, General Hamellin will trigger the ambush.
The Bulldogs will have to fight their way back to the ship, with the Princess in tow, or
turn her over to Hamellin. As far as TransGalaxy is concerned, Hanellin's signature will
be enough to get paid.

#### ProBLeM: FInAL deLIVerY

After they deal with the treacherous General Hamellin, or if they escaped, the Old Royals
ask for the Princess to be delivered in a section of the capitol that they control. Getting
into the capitol will be an issue, as it is under seige by the Somol and Luguss clans. The
crew will need to run the guns of the beseiging clans to reach the drop-off point, use the
armaments from the Somol and Luguss ships to simulate the anti-ship weapons available
on planet.

#### WrAPuP: the end oF the cIVIL WAr

The civil war on Quillem will be over one way or another, depending on how the delivery
shakes out. If Hamellin and the Somol clan get ahold of the Princess, they use her to claim
legitimacy and settle the war in their favor. If she is actually delivered to the Old Royals,
she is set up as the new ruler of the planet in reality, and tries to settle the civil war. The
Somol and Luguss clans will begrudgingly recognize her, but simmering tensions remain.
If she is assassinated or killed, the Luguss clan and Somol clans settle in for a long conflict
and the Old Royals lose any little influence they had.
Delivering her to either Hamellin or the Old Royals at the capital will satisfy
Transgalaxy that the mission is complete and the crew can get paid. Depending on how
she is treated, Princess Lallas may give the Bulldogs a bonus credit in gratitude.
