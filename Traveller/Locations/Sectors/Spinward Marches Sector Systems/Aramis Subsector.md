# ARAMIS SUBSECTOR

![[BtC-AramisSubsector.jpg|500]]
[[BtC-AramisSubsector.jpg|Aramis]]

The Aramis subsector lies at the coreward edge of [[The Spinward Marches|the Marches]]. To trailing is the [[Pretoria subsector]] in [[Deneb Sector|Deneb]], [[Imperial]] territory, but coreward is the [[Vargr Extents]]. Most [[Vargr]] incursions in the four [[Frontier Wars]], and most corsair raids today, come through this subsector. As a result, the 214th Fleet, tasked with protection of [[Traveller/Locations/Sectors/Spinward Marches Sector Systems/Aramis Subsector Systems/Aramis]], attempts to control access to the rest of the sector.

This activity is mainly concentrated on the rimward end of the subsector. The fleet is based out of [[Paya]], [[Natoko]] and [[L'Oeul d'Dieu]], clearly demonstrating the Navy's lack of interest in the relatively unimportant worlds further coreward. Navy ships do sweep the more coreward systems but not anything like as frequently as the rimward ones.

Critics of the [[Imperial]] system of government like to point out that the [[Marquis of Aramis]] is a member of the Tukera family and [[Tukera Lines|Tukera]] is one of the main Imperial megacorporations. They suggest that it is not coincidence that [[Traveller/Locations/Sectors/Spinward Marches Sector Systems/Aramis Subsector Systems/Aramis]] itself has a naval base and is flanked by two others. [[Imperial Navy]] officials (and the office of the [[Marquis of Aramis]]) dismiss this as a typical example of paranoid anti-establishment ranting.

[[Junidy]] is the homeworld of a minor race called the [[Llellewyoly]], colloquially known as 'Dandelions' as a result of their appearance. They are an oddball species falling somewhere between plants and animals, with a highly complex social order that routinely baffles outsiders.

[[Yebab]] is home to the [[Ebokin]].  The [[Ebokin]] are of very little importance in Imperial affairs but [[Yebab]] is represented in the same manner as other Imperial worlds.

Ten worlds in the subsector are [[Amber Zone]]d; [[Zila]], [[Rugbird]], [[Towers]], [[Corfu]], [[Junidy]], [[Zykoca]], [[Aramanx]], [[Pysadi]], [[Dhian]] and [[Reacher]], and the only Red Zone is [[Lewis]]. As usual, the reasons for the [[Red Zone]]s are not publicly available.
