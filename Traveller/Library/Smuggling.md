## SMUGGLER'S LUCK

A tramp trader can make a decent living simply by plying the trade routes, jumping from star system to star system, buying low and selling high. However, mortgages, annual maintenance and unexpected repair costs can add up quickly. Starships are multi-million Credit investments and sometimes playing it safe earns you just enough to pay the bills with only the tiniest of profit margins. Even if a trader is getting by, the temptation to earn more Credits is difficult to pass up. Watching one's peers turn Megacredit deals in the trade of illicit goods makes dabbling on the dark side that much harder to resist. As one prominent trader on the Spinward Main so eloquently put it, 'We have a word for traders who don't deal on the down low from time to time: bankrupt'.

The trading rules in the _Traveller Core Rulebook_ describe the basics of smuggling. Dealing in illegal goods fetches a premium price if one is willing to take the risks. Every system has a Law Level and exporting weapons and armor that transcend it is also classified as smuggling. Dealing in illegal goods and playing with the Law Level differential are not the only ways a smuggler can make a living, however.

The Imperium is an immense and diverse place. Whilst it merely takes one week to jump from one star system to the next, the cultural chasm between them can be immense. You might have a functional anarchy in one system and a religious dictatorship in the next. Goods legal on one world might be forbidden fruit a mere parsec away. Enterprising smugglers are experts in the restrictions of their interstellar region, leaving no stone unturned when it comes to available markets for illegal goods.

### THE BASICS

After dabbling in the smuggling trade for a few months and getting a taste of those sweet Credits, enterprising smugglers look for a region that has all the pieces in place for a long and lucrative run. Whilst above-the-deck free traders need only find a nice, long jump-1 main, smugglers search for a few other things.

First of all, you need not operate on a jump-1 main at all. A region with variation in its astrography is considered preferable. Smuggling is not nearly as reviled as piracy but visiting the same places over and over again and following the same pattern repeatedly is asking for trouble.

An interstellar region with travel choices is best. A smuggler needs to mix it up and jumping off the main from time-to-time keeps them from becoming predictable.

Another desired characteristic is what those in the smuggling trade call 'topography' but not the kind that refers to mountains. Topography means a significant variation in Law Level between adjacent systems. Law Level differentials of 5+ are preferable. Law Level 0-2, especially on an industrial world with a decent Tech Level, means weapons, armor and other high-tech goods are abundantly available. Ideally, two or more systems within 1-3 parsecs will have Law Level 7+, indicating that they strictly prohibit weapons and armor of just about any type. A good smuggler can make bountiful profits in a region of this sort. No need to limit it to just weapons and armor, either; many oppressive systems limit access to all sorts of technology including communications gear, recording devices, entertainment holos and other items. There are many types of contraband. You just have to do your research.

One must be careful, however. Big differentials are well and good but the larger the differential, the greater the temptation to make a killing. Wise smugglers know how to make judicious use of high Law Level markets.

A world with Law Level 10+ is an authoritarian system. Whilst these make fine markets for illegal weapons, armor and other goods, they also tend to have greater levels of surveillance, more frequent patrols and much stricter punishments for criminals. Smugglers doing business on worlds with oppressive governments must exercise caution. Many subscribe to the credo that it is best to have a middleman in such systems, someone who really knows the territory. Sure, a middleman takes part of your profit but you still can make a killing and you do not have to risk your neck to do it.

### SHIP OF CHOICE

Smugglers face an important decision when they select which type of ship to use for their operation. There are a lot of choices and it is important to evaluate each of them before deciding which one works for you.

Engaging in interstellar trade means occasionally being boarded. A trader can be subjected to an inspection in just about any star system but can count on a highly intrusive inspection on worlds with a Law Level 8+.

Being boarded for inspection is not the end of the world if you are a crafty smuggler but it is best to avoid it if possible. Smugglers have many tools to hide illicit cargo from inspectors but if one is carrying a particularly hot cargo, it might be best to prevent an inspection from happening at all. No matter how good the take might be, sometimes it is not worth the stretch. When a patrol is hot on a smuggler's case, they might have to flee a system and seek to sell an illegal cargo elsewhere.

Some patrols will even pursue a ship beyond their own star system if they have extended jurisdiction and a good inkling where the smuggler is going. For this reason, many smugglers prefer to operate jump-2 ships. It is by no means a requirement but is considered a worthwhile luxury. When being pursued, it is much easier for a patrol craft to predict the destination of a jump-1 ship than a jump-2 vessel. A smuggler with a jump-2 ship has more options when they have a tail they want to shake. Firstly, they can jump two parsecs to any location with a star system or fuel cache. Sometimes it is best to put as much distance as possible between your ship and an eager pursuer.

Even if you do have jump-2 capability, a smuggler might play the part of the jump-1 trader and make a one-parsec jump. This is essentially hiding in plain sight. Making a one-parsec jump under pursuit can be like hitting the reset button. Even if the pursuer follows the smuggler and correctly guesses which system they are jumping to, the smuggler can always play the part of the innocent trader who is merely proceeding to the next stop on their run.

The third option is to make a microjump. Jumping from one location to another in the same star system might seem like a waste of valuable time and a parsec's worth of fuel, however if a patrol corvette is hot on your tail, a week in jump is better than a decade on a penal colony. Furthermore, in some cases there is a viable second port or freeport in the system, giving the smuggler a second chance to offload hot cargo without even leaving the system.

For those smugglers who believe jump-2 is a necessity, the far trader or Soho-class is the spacecraft of choice. Both classes are known jump-2 ships and their transponders will be pinging away their identity for anyone who wants to know. The Soho is the most ideal as it foregoes passenger staterooms in favor of more cargo space. If you are carrying illicit cargo, you do not want nosy passengers sniffing around.

It is considered to be preferable to fly a known jump-2 ship. The mere fact that the smuggler has so many choices puts many patrol ships off the trail. So whilst the Type-A2 far trader is a jump-2 ship, it is often mistaken for the ubiquitous jump-1 free trader for obvious reasons. Only the most astute patrol craft commanders may bother to check the power signatures of a ship to discern the difference.

Alternatively, a smuggler may indeed operate a jump-1 ship but will almost universally employ a fuel bladder to cross two- and sometimes even three-parsec gaps to enhance his escapability and add a little unpredictability to travel destination. Jump-1 ships usually have larger cargo holds, which means greater profit over the long run. By using a fuel bladder when you think you might need it, you have the flexibility to stay out of trouble without having to sacrifice so much cargo space.

### THE COLLACE ARM

A fine example of a place where a smuggler can make a good living is along the [[Collace Arm]] in the [[District 268]] subsector of the the [[Spinward Marches]]. The region lies beyond the Imperial borders and features two star systems that rise above the rest in power and influence: [[Collace]] and [[Trexalon]].
![[JTAS-01-160.jpg]]
Collace is a high-population, industrial world with aspirations of becoming the subsector capital, should the Imperium ever annex the region, and has already done what it can to tie the knot, having successfully attained Client State status. Trexalon by contrast is fiercely independent and wants nothing to do with the Imperium. The Trexalonians see the Imperials as having an intrusive presence and do whatever they can to prevent further Imperial incursions into the subsector.

The two systems are in a cold war with one another. Collace is focused on building its economy and establishing a growing influence in the region whilst Trexalon strives to maintain independence, evangelising its neighbors with that self-same spirit, and to subversively undercut Collace whenever and wherever it can. Trexalon is very careful not to allow the conflict to get violent, lest it attract Collace's benefactor from getting involved, and is well aware that, should the Imperium will it, Trexalon could be glassed over or reduced to dust with the dispatch of a few destroyers. They find that keeping a low profile enables them to pursue their interests whilst sabotaging Collace's.

The two systems are frequently at odds with each other, getting into one conflict or another in proxy trade wars along the Collace Arm. This region has all the features listed earlier, and more. You have a great deal of topography with both high- and low-Law Level systems in close proximity to one another. In addition, both Collace and Trexalon have a tendency to exert political and low-level military will over many of their neighbors. This creates a lot of situations in which various goods have become illegal or restricted where they otherwise would not be.

Collace and Trexalon also have embargoes in place on each other's goods. Trexalon has many agricultural and pharmaceutical products in short supply on Collace. Likewise, Collace has greater expertise in atmospheric processing and terraforming gear that could make life easier on dry Trexalon. Whilst trade is prohibited between the two worlds, smugglers make a pretty penny buying and selling embargoed products to each party.

### TOOLS OF THE TRADE

Smugglers have an array of tools and equipment at their disposal. Some have already been detailed in [[High Guard]] :

- Popup Mountings (page 24 of _High Guard_ ): Whilst it is not illegal to have weaponry on civilian ships in most star systems, the appearance of an unarmed ship can divert suspicions of patrol craft. 'Nothing to see here! Just an unarmed trader!'
- Concealed Compartments (page 45 of _High Guard_ ): Up to five percent of a ship can be designated as concealed at a cost of Cr20000 per ton. Such compartments provide DM-2 to Electronics (sensors) checks and DM-4 to Investigation checks.
- Fuel Tank Compartments (page 45 of _High Guard_ ): Similar to concealed compartments but located within a ship's fuel tanks, these compartments float inside the tanks and are even more difficult to detect, providing DM-4 to Electronics (sensors) checks and DM-6 to Investigation checks.
- Early Jump (page 48 of _High Guard_ ): Advanced jump drives can be equipped with modifications that allow a ship to jump 10 percent closer to a gravity well. This key technology has enabled many smugglers to get away from a patrol just before being boarded.

In addition to the above, some smugglers use the following to further disguise and contain their illegal cargoes.

- Fake Drive Components: Fake drive components in the engineering section can serve as containers for small but valuable caches of goods. This costs Cr5000 per ton and provides 80 percent of its space for storage (for example, a five-ton fake drive component can store four tons of cargo). Including life support costs Cr10000 per ton and enables the storage of passengers or prohibited livestock. Fake drive components are usually equipped with a heating element to ensure the temperature on their exterior surface resembles the real thing.
- Faux Cargo Modules: The Imperium and other polities use standard cargo modules in various sizes. Faux versions of 1-, 5- and 10-ton cargo modules are available, providing 90 percent of their available space for cargo storage. The remainder are facades visible to inspectors when opened. Often a façade depicts items that inspectors are unlikely to investigate further, such as common grain, dangerous chemicals or fragile industrial goods. Faux cargo modules cost Cr2000 per ton.
