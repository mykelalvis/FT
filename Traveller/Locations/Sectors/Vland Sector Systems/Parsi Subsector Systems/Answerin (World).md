- x2 planetoid belts.

### Mainworld Data

#### Mainworld Atmosphere (A)

- Verified updated charts are constantly sought.
- Detailed survey data commands premium prices.

### Lifeforms

Answerin is noted for useful and complex flora, including such plants as the Mariyel Black Lily and the Liqar, a herb with many medicinal applications. In contrast, Answerin's animal life is small and relatively primitive.

# History & Background (Dossier)

[[Answerin]] culture holds fear of any kind to be a disease of the mind, and Answerin's psychiatrists have effective techniques for eradicating all anxiety from the populace. The principal diagnostic tool for this is a portable device which detects anxiety, by analyzing thoughts and body functions. The device's use borders too closely on psionic practices to allow it free export to the rest of the Imperium, but illegal copies are sometimes smuggled out.

- When necessary, natives of Answerin can produce an adrenalin reaction in their bodies, which gives them temporary superhuman strength and dexterity. Mercenaries from Answerin command premium prices for service.

### Languages

- [[Anglic]]
- Anseri
- Vilani

### World Government (G)

Answerin is governed by a [[Civil Service Bureaucracy]].  For thousands of years, the Answerin have believed that rational Human minds, unfettered by fear, are capable of properly ordering state affairs and creating just laws. Consequently, the Answerin view democracy as the preferrable form of government, and despite being loyal Imperial citizens they accept the Imperium's political philosophy grudgingly at best. They recognize the problems inherent in an interstellar democracy, but in keeping with their ethos do not shy away from the idea just because it might be difficult. For their part, many Imperial citizens find Answerin's democracy messy and contentious.

### Imperial High (Landed) Nobility

**Answerin**, as a member world of the Third Imperium, holds the estates of two members of the Imperial Nobility, who are charged with overseeing the world.

- It holds the estate of an Imperial knight.
- It holds the fiefdom of an Imperial count.

  - -2000: Answerin has reached TL-9 and is a minor trade centre.

- 624: the Express Boat Network is established, facilitating communications, trade, and economic growth within the area.
- 995-1065: the Second Survey charts the system.
