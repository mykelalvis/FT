# GREEN ZONE

A Green Zone is not so much a classification as an indication the system has no known hazards. Outside the borders of a polity, this may indicate ignorance of local conditions more than any assurance of safety. Most worlds within the border of a polity that are not subject to natural hazards, anarchy, war or particularly harsh government policies are considered Green Zones.
