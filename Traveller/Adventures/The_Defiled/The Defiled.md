# The Defiled

## Referee's Overview

While on a primitive world, the PCs are approached by tribal elders who explain that their most sacred site has been overrun and defiled by animals. Only the tribal shamans -- all wizened old men -- are allowed to set foot on the hallowed ground. But the PCs aren't bound by tribal law, so the elders hire them to undertake the task. The heroes quickly find that the “temple” is the wreck of an old starship. Worse, the creatures infesting the site are presentient; bothering them could be against the law.

## Players' Information

The primitive natives of this small backwater world don't know much about interstellar affairs, but they drive a hard bargain for trade goods and are more than willing to celebrate good trading with several days of drinking and feasting. During one of the celebrations, the PCs are approached by a delegation of tribal elders — who had been engaged in some sort of debate all day — with a problem that only the People-Who-Come-To-Us-From The-Night-Sky can solve.

About a half-day's walk from the village, an ancient temple sits in a murky swamp. Word has reached the tribal elders that vicious animals have defiled it by taking up residence. The problem is that by tribal law, only shamans may set foot on the sacred ground; and in any case, the shamans are all old now, and no match for dangerous beasts. However, the presence of the adventurers presents a loophole they can exploit. Since they aren't of the tribe, they are free to do whatever is necessary to clear the creatures from the temple. In return, the tribe is willing to part with half its treasury (worth only Cr100x1D6 monetarily, but on a 10 or greater, there are 1D6 items actually worth Cr1000x1D6) they also hint that the celebrations might go on another week in the heroes' honor.

## Referee's Information

Along the way through the swamp, the adventurers stumble across the territory of two [[#Bog Fiend]]s.

Assuming the adventurers defend themselves with firearms and/or explosives, a throw of 8+ means the fight happened close enough to the temple that any hope of surprise or stealth is ruined (see below.)

As the group nears the destination, they can tell that, although overgrown with swamp vegetation, the “temple” is recognizable to them as the wreck of a 30,000-ton warship (a Light Cruiser, if it matters) which crashed almost 3,000 years ago.

Near the starboard side of the ship a band of [[#Swampjack]]s numbering around 300 (50% adult female, 30% adult male, and the rest young) have moved in. If the PCs can observe without being detected, they'll see the [[#Swampjack]]s making and using stone and bone tools and other behavior any xenologists with the group recognize as characteristics of presentience, enough to warrant further investigation.

If the heroes are detected (10+; DM +2 if their fight with the Bog Fiends was close to the camp), or simply waltz into the camp guns blazing, they find that [[#Swampjack]]s are aggressively territorial, with the males fighting to the death while the females and young move into the wreck for protection. If the heroes decide to sneak into the ship (10+) they have several options:

- Hull breaches (6+ and 1D3 minutes to locate)
- Egress hatches (9+ and 3D6 minutes to locate, 10+ to open)
- Maintenance hatches (11+ and 6D6 minutes to locate; 12+ to open.)

While sneaking around, a wandering [[#Swampjack]] may catch them (8+, every 15 minutes) and sound an alarm by croaking. 5D6 males arrive on the scene in 1D6 combat rounds.

## Inside the ship

Inside, the damaged ship is a maze; the most important areas are noted on the map. Chances of being caught by a wandering [[#Swampjack]] are as above.

1. Ship's bridge - Unoccupied
2. Armory and ship's stores - unoccupied on 3+
3. Any given quarters and commons areas on 5+
4. Engineering on an 8+
5. Any given vehicle bay on 10+
6. Fuel tankage (the fuel has long since seeped away) are never unoccupied;
7. Computer room are unoccupied.
8. Cargo hold has the greatest concentration of natives at any given time.

Combat in the fuel tankage baffles is at a -2 due to close, labyrinthine quarters. Again, check for wandering sentries.

PCs with salvage ideas will be disappointed: combat and crash damage and subsequent exposure to the elements have made it unsalvageable. But the computer core might be saved (Computer 12+), as well as some interior starship machinery. Unoccupied quarters hold remains (5+) and/or valuables (8+, 1D6 x Cr250 per stateroom.) But the “temple” is sacred to the planet's inhabitants; they won't take kindly to what they view as looting. The interstellar government might pay the group a finder's fee if they duly report the wreck.
