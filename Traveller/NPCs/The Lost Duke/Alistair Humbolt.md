Alistair Humbolt grew up with tales of his family's glory days and was told often about the harsh treatment they received from the [[Imperium]] due to their part in the [[Civil War]]. He listened as his elders spoke of how close they were to ruling all of [[Deneb Sector|Deneb]] and how they spat when they spoke of banishment and all that was stripped away. The young boy took those stories to heart and as he grew into a man he devised ways to bring the [[Humbolt family|Humbolts]] back to glory. 

Adopting the alias of Alistair Halker, he travelled the sector to study at the best universities and train under great business leaders. He amassed a small fortune on his own and his beloved great-uncle aided him in financing [[Pernach Solutions]] as a way of gathering resources to one day be the foundation of a new Humbolt empire.

While [[Pernach Solutions|Pernach]]'s legitimate enterprises have proven lucrative for Alistair, his desire for power and twisted ideals of nobility have bred a desire to rule. When his agents discovered [[Brufort]] he saw an opportunity to establish a place of his own under the guise of being the protector of the planet. Alistair was able to use his influence with [[Regent Phirric]] and his own natural charms to establish himself within [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]] and use false acts of benevolence to gain a stranglehold on the city while still pretending to be its saviour. Unfortunately, for all his ambitions Alistair is hampered by his temper, and a cruel streak against any who would insult or threaten him, and the people of [[Brufort#Caelestis|Caelestis]] are becoming aware of the petty tyrant within their midst.
