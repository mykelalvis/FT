Heavily populated Sanches is considered by most to be the gateway to Dagudashaag but the Sanchesian Prime Worlds – the high-population cluster of worlds centered around the Sanches system itself – are primarily focused on serving the Core. Its two industrial worlds, Alekvadin and Dudin, manufacture many of the sector’s consumer electronics and entertainment devices. Sanches brings in a great deal of wealth from the sales of its products to the other worlds of the Core and exports to other sectors. The business of the subsector is business. Its culture is highly collective with individual needs and wants set aside in order to serve the greater good of the Core. The subsector is mostly surrounded by less-populated, provincial subsectors; therefore, the transportation of its goods requires the assistance of long-range freighters that bridge the gaps to the other high-population worlds of the sector. Many of these starships are constructed in this subsector at the shipyards on Per, Kakhu Gash and Sanches itself. While the yards on Sanches are also used by military contractors, the majority of their products are civilian in nature and include the production of megafreighters of 50,000–500,000 tons and ranging from jump-1 to jump-4 in performance.

Almost all of the worlds in the subsector retain their original Vilani names with the sole exception being Sanches itself. Most believe that the name is simply a corruption of Sanshes, a common Vilani surname, but it was in fact renamed by Terran Admiral Anatoliy Sanches, whose naval forces conquered the system late in the Interstellar Wars. After setting up shop on the planet, he renamed it after himself and left the remainder of world names in the subsector intact.

The subsector economy is bolstered by two small jump-1 mains: the Sanches Cluster to spinward and the Quadrant I Main, which dips into Apge, Perite and Mekee. Sanches’ high-population worlds have economies that far outstrip those of its neighbors and Sanchesian traders rarely pass up the chance to remind them of this. Sanches’ well-to-do worlds sees themselves as powerful engines of prosperity for which their neighbors should be thankful. Sanchesian arrogance is mostly tolerated as long as the Credits keep flowing into their coffers.

The Sanches subsector is defended by the Imperial Navy’s 200th Fleet with headquarters at the Sanches Navy Base. The navy has a large presence in the subsector and regularly harbours squadrons in the Gir, Khid and Neki systems in order to quell problems on some of the troublesome worlds of the neighboring Dagudashaag sector. While Dagudashaag has its own Imperial Navy fleet elements, the Core has expressed concern over their seeming inability to establish a degree of lasting peace on many of its worlds. The spectre of the Ilelish Revolt still looms large and the Imperium is determined that such a thing should never occur again, especially on its proverbial doorstep.
