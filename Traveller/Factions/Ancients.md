### THE ANCIENTS

Little is known about the Ancients and it is probable that most of what is known is inaccurate. Various theories have been put forward, most of which have insurmountable flaws. Most scientists agree that the Ancients reached the height of their power several hundred thousand years ago and their disappearance coincides with a fair amount of damage to Charted Space; there are several asteroid belts and devastated worlds dating from that period. The most popular explanation is that they fought each other, or someone else, to mutual destruction.

Various Ancient devices and sites have been found, along with larger numbers of mistaken and outright fraudulent finds. Trade in Ancient artefacts is heavily restricted but there are always those who will pay Credits for a working item.

The Ancients are thought to have been responsible for transplanting many species, including humans and Vargr. They may have terraformed worlds, or seeded them with life, and are probably responsible for the presence of [[Terra|Terran]] plants and animals on worlds only now being charted by humans.

The wonders of the Ancients are mostly lost and those found are often incomprehensible. Devices are discovered that have no known function and those that can be used remain mysterious. The Ancients and their technology are something of a modern superstition; any unexplained phenomenon tends to be blamed on the Ancients.

## Ancients

The name given to a race of intelligent, non- human beings who inhabited various locations in this portion of the galaxy approximately â€“300000. Archaeological evidence recovered from excavations of the few known Ancient cities indicates that the race destroyed itself during a 2000 year period of intense warfare which left only ruined cities and shattered planets.

The Ancients were responsible for several major features within the region now occupied by the Imperium. Their warfare resulted in the large proportion of asteroid belts throughout this spiral arm. There is evidence that they created the multi- world rosette at Tireen (in the Vargr Extents). Scattered empty cities (most severely damaged by battle) stand as evidence of their wars; most, however, are restricted areas under investigation by the Imperium and not open to the public.

The Ancients are generally accepted as responsible for the dissemination of Humaniti within its current domain when they transplanted genetic stock from Terra to at least one hundred worlds across a span of some 360 parsecs.

The Ancients are also responsible for the creation of the Vargr through genetic manipulation of Terran canine stock, acquired at the same time as Humaniti.

Some Imperial scientists believe that the Ancients' physiology greatly resembles that of the extant Droyne. Some scientists have even proposed that the Droyne and the Ancients may be the same or related species, and possibly even subspecies of the same race.

Cruiser: Ship capable of independent operations and of support of the main line of battle. Cruisers are intended to fulfil two diverse missions - in battle, they support and reinforce capital ships which are present and which form the main line of battle, generally from the flanks, and they perform independent operations, often forming the center of task forces which have no capital ships. Cruisers are also put to use as independent ships. Droyne: Intelligent major race inhabiting scattered worlds within an area slightly larger than the Third Imperium. The Droyne are a small race, derived from winged herbivore gatherers. They vary in size depending on caste, but generally stand 1 meter tall (large workers and warriors can be taller than humans). The history of their evolution remains a puzzle because their homeworld is not know with certainty. Droyne society is divided into rigid castes determined when an individual reaches adolescence. The six castes of the Droyne all serve different functions within Droyne society. Although identical at the time of caste selection, caste members develop pronounced physical and mental differences by maturity, different genetic programs being awakened by differences in diet and environment among the various castes. Young leaders, for instance, experience a nearly 30% increase in brain size in the first year after casting; drones develop sexual organs; and so on. The six castes that comprise Droyne society are the Worker, the Warrior, the Drone, the Technician, the Leader and the Sport. The last caste is a deliberate exception to the rigidity of the caste structure. Sports are specific individuals who cross caste lines to become more individual, filling the roles of scouts, messengers, representatives, hunters, prospectors, and other occupations that require independent initiative or separation from Droyne society for prolonged periods. There is little individual freedom within Droyne society, and as a result, society and government join into one concept. Workers work, Leaders lead. All of society dedicated to continuing the existence that provides all members food, shelter, and the other amenities that make life enjoyable. In addition, there is little discord in Droyne society when things are running smoothly, as each member of society has tis own function to perform. Only when disaster happens is the group forced to strain.
