Kamsii is a pleasure planet, with virtually all of its land masses and much of its seas devoted to providing entertainment for millions of visitors. Amusement parks, nature preserves, zoos, ocean cruises, immersive virtual reality experiences and just about any other entertainment that one can imagine is available on Kamsii.

Kamsii is the subsector capital and the Ducal Offices are there but the Duchess of Dingtra actually spends little time on the world. The ruling family of Kamsii are descendants of Solomani who conquered the world during the Interstellar Wars. A patriarch or matriarch of the family is assigned the nominal role of count or countess but rarely do they use this appellation. Along with their apparent distaste for the terminology of noble lineage, the family controls Kamsii as if it were a city state within Imperial confines. They maintain their own sublight planetary navy, which patrols close orbit all the way out to the 100-diameter limit. There is both an Imperial Navy base and scout way station but neither has a presence on Kamsii itself. Both are located in orbital space stations and on the surfaces of other worlds in the system.

Kamsii is also the site of sizeable Hiver, Droyne and most recently K'kree enclaves. While these are ostensibly tourist attractions of a sort, the government is careful to nurture relationships with each of them in an effort to prevent their inhabitants from feeling like exhibits in a zoo.
