"Daniel" is a large man with thinning hair and a thick moustache. He has an affable demeanour but is a hard negotiator and shrewd businessman who makes his living as a broker. Daniel is a regular feature in [[Ruby#The Factory]] bar, which he uses as his office. Clients come to him seeking particular services or goods (both legal and illegal) and Daniel can put them in touch with the right people for a reasonable commission.

Although Daniel is not directly in the service of the Imperium, he is a loyal citizen (in his own way) who often works for a select group of Imperial agents. He has spent many years building up a network of contacts in a variety of fields. Many of his contacts operate outside of the law but for many agents working undercover the skills of these contacts can be vital to the completion of their missions.

Conducting the business that he does, Daniel must be careful when dealing with new clients. For this reason, he runs a simple merchant business as a front under his real name of Stephen Muller. His underground name, Daniel, is only used by his most trusted clients and contacts.

### THE TEST

Although Daniel is a regular customer at [[Ruby#The Factory]], his first rule when dealing with any client is that they are not to reveal his alternate identity. To the casual onlooker, Daniel is just a normal businessman (Stephen Muller) who uses this establishment to conduct his business. If anyone asks around, nobody will not know who Daniel is but they might notice that they are being observed on a successful Recon check DM –4.

The test is actually quite simple. The supplicants simply have to wait for Daniel to contact them. He will know that people have been asking around for him and the players may even have asked him without knowing who he was.

Once they start to get bored of waiting, Daniel will approach the party under his real name of Stephen Muller. Stephen will ask the players if they are here to do business and he will attempt to negotiate a sale of goods (you can use the Cargo Type table to determine what he has for sale).
