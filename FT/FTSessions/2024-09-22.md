## Events
Essentially whole session was about 
1. Making fun of me
2. Discussion about doing the retrieval for [[Bloqua Altidore]] (they decided to do so)
3. Me wondering why they were "timid"
4. The fight night

It was in an empty warehouse.  Security was in the form of [[Ase]] forces with long coats over their uniforms.  [[Syn To Rei]] was presiding, but appears to be just fine with how things were running..

Several fights happened.

Among the crew, they netted +4 credit stress ( + 3 of that was on [[Boxtopus]])


[[Jerry]] almost got nicked trying to place bets in an event he didn't realize was controlled by the [[Sylean Syndicate]].  [[Eddie]] realized this when the bookie used a code word ("Eekoyenia", a bastardization of old Greek for "family").

[[TsuZ]] ended up asking [[Syn To Rei]] for a job as a medic.

[[Boxtopus]] fought a female [[Sydite]] and it looked like one of the things from "Edge of Tomorrow".  Fight over in 30 seconds, and Boxtopus picked up the 300kg (actual 340kg) Sydite with two arms and carried her over to be patched up.  It then just walked out.

The (now slightly drunk [[Loose Coalition of Shady Motherfuckers]]) proceeded back to [[Eneri's Cantina]] where [[Imperial Cannonade]] was setting up.  The bassoonist, the (something), and the bagpipe player all see [[Jerry]] and the bassoonist drops his cases.  

Session ended there
