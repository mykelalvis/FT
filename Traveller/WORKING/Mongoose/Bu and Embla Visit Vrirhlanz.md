# INTRODUCTION

In this supplement, two Travellers named Bu and Embla visit Vrirhlanz, the homeworld of the Hlanssai. Bu and Embla Visit Vrirhlanz will help the Referee understand what Travellers may see and feel as they explore a new world, this one in particular.

Located in the [[Gzaekfueg Sector]] within the [[Vargr Extents]], [[Vrirhlanz]] is a garden world with a standard atmosphere but no worldwide industry, government or legal system. Travel on the world is limited by infrastructure and Travellers may be called to help some of the world’s inhabitants as they make their way across the continents. The Referee should emphasise the disparate nature of the world, with the focus of this supplement being the discovery and exploration of a less than well-known world. Exploration is one of the key concepts behind Traveller, with the Referee and Travellers visiting different societies, species and cultures.

> [!note] Excerpt From Bu's Personal Diary
>
> Embla’s homeworld is so strange, even compared to everything else I have seen. The starport is as chaotic as usual but the rest of the world seems so quiet. You can sort of hear some cars moving around nearby but nothing like you would get at Regina or Mora. It is also rather strange, especially because of the worlds we have visited previously, that the majority of the people here seem to be Vargr. There are also many more Hlanssai than I ever thought possible, although that is comforting in a sense. Most of them have not really spoken to me, although they keep turning to stare at me for reasons I cannot fathom.

Visiting governments outside of the Third Imperium is a factor in many campaigns and this supplement grants greater insight into what life may be like in a Vargr client state. Travellers will pass through a security checkpoint at a downport run by both Vargr and Hlanssai, and experience how the two species interact. If you are currently running a campaign in the Vargr Extents, you can easily introduce the Hlanssai and have your Travellers explore Vrirhlanz in greater depth.

> [!note] EXCERPT FROM EMBLA’S PERSONAL DIARY
> The last few months have been quite difficult, with the Imperial Navy catching up to us again. We decided to make for Vargr space, hiding within the chaos of the corsairs. Bu seemed a little bit concerned, as she had not travelled here before, but I told her that everything would be fine as long as we could get to the Ruler of Five territory. I am one of the more well-known Hlanssai in this area, what with the exploits we have already gotten away with.
>
> We used to take some holidays from each other and part of that included me travelling back home. Bu never came with me and I am unsure what she did during those months. Maybe she went back to the GLIPS? She enjoyed it there the first time. I hope she likes Vrirhlanz, as it is probably not like any other world she has visited. I know that she grew up in a very industrialised place, so it will be an experience for her, at least.

Hlanssai may be encountered throughout Charted Space, particularly in spinward and coreward regions, and in a wide variety of circumstances. Many are afflicted with wanderlust, becoming roving artists, entertainers, animal-handlers or adventurers. A strong disinclination to settle anywhere for long – and an inability to remain on good terms with one employer for extended periods – keeps them on the move.

Some Hlanssai become ‘liaison specialists’ in the employ of merchant starships engaged in exploratory work, in which their immense capacity for empathy is extremely useful, but Hlanssai cannot accept discipline and so rarely find work in large, formal organizations. They are almost never found in military service.

The Hlanssai are a humanoid minor race originating in the Vargr Extents. Today they can be encountered throughout much of the Imperium, although they are uncommon far to rimward of the Imperial core. The Hlanssai are widely admired for their artistic talents, grace and dexterity, but many members of other races distrust the Hlanssai because of their – justified – reputation for emotional instability.

Hlanssai are tall, averaging just over two meters but very light and slender of build, rarely massing more than 55–60 kilograms. The race is homeothermic, bisexual and viviparous, producing one or two young after an eight-month gestation period. Hlanssai bodies are half covered with a silky, glossy yellow fur and they seldom bother with clothing. Their most striking visual feature is the head, with its two large eyes and two even larger ears. The former are sensitive to a range of frequencies extending into the ultraviolet; the external flaps of the latter serve to detect thermal radiation and air currents with considerable efficiency, as well as focusing sound into a highly efficient inner ear. The race’s hands have three three-jointed fingers and a stubby, unjointed ‘thumb’ each; their feet are similar and can provide grip, especially when climbing.

# HLANSSAI TRAVELLERS

![[BaEVV-020.jpg]]

## CHARACTERISTICS

Hlanssai Travellers have the following modifiers applied to their characteristics: STR -2, DEX +2, EDU -2
SOC is always treated as 5 in alien societies but position in Hlanssai society is determined on 1D+4.

## TRAITS

Hlanssai Travellers all possess one of the following traits:

### N’tarronth

This Hlanssai is the sort to impose their will upon the universe and likely has a technical inclination. They gain DM+2 on all checks rolled to make things happen, such as persuading someone to do something or building a device to carry out a necessary function.

### N’tarronchii’a

This Hlanssai goes with the flow of the universe and has an inclination towards arts and sciences that explain mysteries of the cosmos. The Hlanssai gains DM+2 on all checks dealing with comprehension, such as understanding someone else’s motivations or expressing the gravitational forces around a star in mathematical form.

![[BaEVV-022.jpg]]

## CAREERS

Hlanssai outside their traditional social environment can enter any career but suffer DM-6 to enlist or advance in military careers. DM-3 is applied to enlist and advance in careers and assignments within major corporations (such as merchant marine or corporate agent).

Hlanssai raised in their home society do not follow the standard career system but instead choose whether they are N’tarronth or N’tarronchii’a. The Traveller then begins a series of one to six terms of service. N’tarronth Hlanssai can choose how many terms to serve but N’tarronchii’a roll 1D for the number of terms served. There are no re-enlistment, commission, promotion or survival checks, but each term the Hlanssai gain a skill and roll to see if they gain an extra skill in addition. N’tarronth Hlanssai gain an extra skill on a straight check of 10+. N’tarronchii’a Hlanssai gain an extra skill on 8+.

All Hlanssai may roll on the Life and Activity columns here or on the N’tarronth or N’tarronchii’a columns, according to chosen philosophy.

> [!info] ROLEPLAYING THE HLANSSAI ^RPHLANSSAI
> When incorporating Hlanssai into a campaign, the Referee should take care to emphasise how alien this species is. Generally, Hlanssai stay away from longer-term bonds, although this does not mean they are not able to form close friendships, instead acting more hedonistically and being more prone to impulses and minute sensory inputs. The stimuli they respond to are much more varied than many other species can detect, meaning those around them may not understand why the Hlanssai are acting the way they are. That said, most species find them charismatic and enigmatic, if slightly chaotic.

# LANDING

Vrirhlanz (B657721-7) lies on the trailing edge of the [[Okhuemgir subsector]] (in [[Gzaekfueg Sector|Gzaekfueg]]), deep within the [[Vargr Extents]]. It is within the territory of the Ruler of Five, an interstellar government formed by the Urzaeng Vargr. The cultural and psychological differences between Urzaeng and Hlanssai are obvious, thanks to the particularly violent nature of the Vargr. On Vrirhlanz, the Vargr suprapolity has established a starport authority, although it lacks the fine-tuning seen within the Third Imperium.

> [!Warning] URZAENG VARGR
>
> The Urzaeng are a notably violent subspecies of Vargr, primarily active within the coreward Windhorn region of the Vargr Extents. Their expansion into Imperial territories was not as deep as others because of the wars with the Second Empire of Gashikan. Runts, the elderly and the chronically ill are usually collected and placed into separate communities and any Vargr with an illness is best advised to separate themselves from the larger group until recovered. Unlike other subspecies, such as the Kokasha, the Urzaeng were geneered for enhanced physical prowess, sacrificing enhanced mental abilities. Their disdain for weakness directly contradicts with their protectiveness over the Hlanssai but the two species have reached a tentative harmony due to the Hlanssai’s gregariousness, capability for complex problem solving and natural lack of aggression.

Vargr presence on the world is limited, tending to be located around the starport, although the odd Vargr may decide to live further inland. Urzaeng and Hlanssai, for the most part, are content to let the other do as they please. Millennia of working with each other, even under different governments, has allowed them to reach a steady peace, with the Vargr seeing the Hlanssai as a weaker species they must protect, and the Hlanssai viewing the Vargr as useful, if rather graceless. The Ruler of Five imports the vast majority of advanced technology obtainable on Vrirhlanz, raising the generally available Tech Level to 10.

Hlanssai nature helps them understand the often unpredictable Vargr, although the latter still does not understand a large part of Hlanssai psychology. Despite this, the two have a number of trade and work agreements in place, with Hlanssai regularly accompanying Vargr in interstellar travel to act as scientists, sophontologists, traders and spies. Landing on the planet requires interacting with both, with Vargr as starport security and Hlanssai handling diplomatic affairs. Within the starport, Vrir Down, it is common to see groups of both acting in tandem to process arrivals and departures.

Some humans can also be seen, generally Solomani and Vilani, often working with Vargr as mercenary crews. The notable violence of the Urzaeng Vargr lends itself well to more ruthless members of humanity. The three distinct species have made Vrirhlanz a contrasting place, with a mixture of architecture, design and cultural beliefs. The Hlanssai that live the furthest from the starport are the most unchanged, although they still benefit from advanced imports to the world.

## THE STARPORT

Vrir Down is, like much of Vrirhlanz, built with Vargr and human technology, and redesigned by Hlanssai. This makes it less a cacophony of colour than more traditional Vargr settlements, although telltale frills, crescents and ornamentation remain. Hlanssai design tends towards the utilitarian, with the N’tarronth taking the idea of ‘shaping’ or
‘manufacturing’ rather literally at times, and it is usually the role of the N’tarronchaii’a to elevate designs, making them into veritable works of art.

After landing and exiting their ship, visitors to Vrirhlanz will be funnelled into the starport proper, where they are usually met by a mixture of Vargr, Hlanssai and Humaniti. Security is rather lax due to the low Law Level, mostly done to ensure no explosives, battle dress or weapons of mass destruction are present, although the Vargr performing these checks are more aggressive about it than may be necessary. Scanners imported from higher TL worlds are in operation here and the Vargr of Vrirhlanz are determined to keep the Hlanssai, their weak but friendly compatriots, safe. Even so, the Hlanssai working within Vrir Down should not be underestimated by anyone attempting to smuggle goods onto the planet, keen as their senses are.

The downport itself is light and airy, with telltale signs of the architecture being designed by Vargr. It is patchwork in places, although this is limited to the customs area, where visitors pass through when they first arrive on the planet. Once past security, Hlanssai design takes over. The building is fluid in shape but functional. Tall, sweeping arches are preferred over doorways, to allow for Hlanssai height, and most surfaces are soft or smooth to account for their disdain for clothing.

Renovations are a constant sight as the Hlanssai work out new ways to funnel traffic, organise restaurants, cafes and bars, and manage the accommodation needs of the Vargr. The architects try to hide Vargr areas from public view as much as possible, the dazzling array of colours overwhelming Hlanssai eyes and causing headaches. The mix of people can similarly be overwhelming at times, particularly for those who have only recently come to the downport. Hlanssai find this most difficult, as their tribes are secluded enough that they have few interactions with other sophonts.

> [!info] Bu's Diary

> We have finally landed at Embla’s homeworld and the starport itself is magnificent, although I am unsure who built it. The Captain announced that we were landing soon-ish and we have been preparing since. We have got into a routine with these journeys after our own ship was destroyed by corsairs, and have been a bit more relaxed about where we are going. The Vargr Extents were somewhere I have always wanted to explore and Embla explained that this is where she grew up – so that is where we decided to go! She has told me that most places are named in Gvegh, so I will need to practise the language before we get too far into the wilds.

## SECURITY

Security officers are some of the most patient Vargr in Vrir Down, as far as Vargr generally go, which may be less than comforting for humans. Checkpoints are fast-moving but their personnel will sometimes appear as if they are spoiling for a fight. They will become ruthless when someone attempts to bring something not permitted upon the world.

There is a somewhat organised chain of command, although people holding positions change regularly enough that were someone to visit every few months, it is likely that any contacts they previously had would no longer be there, as they move around to different opportunities and places. Humans on Vrirhlanz find this frustrating but it suits the Vargr and Hlanssai well. Most humans working here tend to stick to civil service and make up the majority of bureaucrats and brokers, with Vargr occupying security roles and Hlanssai acting as diplomats. Humans tend to run the smaller businesses, cafes and restaurants at Vrir Down, being more accustomed to a life in commerce.

For most arrivals, the customs process is relatively simple. Deboard from the ship, wait in line at security, make a mental note of the Vargr officers here being a little ruder than at home and carry on into Vrirhlanz. However, there is always the chance that officers at the gate may take an exception to a visitor, with the Hlanssai sensual awareness causing them to step in before the Vargr get trigger-happy. In general, there will be two Vargr and one Hlanssai at every checkpoint.

When dealing with security at Vrir Down, Travellers are advised to remain as calm as possible and avoid signs of hostility. This can be harder said than done, as Hlanssai are notorious for their ability to notice even the most minute details. Occasionally, a newer Hlanssai may alert one of the Vargr to these but will quickly learn why those who have been working here longer do not. On one occasion, a recruit mentioned signs of aggression in a human being processed, which caused several nearby Vargr to beat them into oblivion.

## SECURITY CHECKS

To determine how Vargr or Hlanssai react to a Traveller during entry, roll on both columns of the [[#Security table]]. Results will impact the Travellers as they pass through the gates and give the Referee a way to make the guards more interesting. Concealing something while passing through security requires a successful Difficult (10+) Stealth check (2D minutes, DEX) or possibly a successful Average (8+) Persuade check (2D minutes, SOC) if the item is merely questionable rather than banned.

Random searches delay the time it takes to pass through customs by 1Dx10 minutes. Those working here are rather hard to bargain with, having heard so many variations of the same problem. Any attempt to Persuade them to hurry up suffers DM-1.

Should anything go dreadfully wrong, the Referee can use two characters, Unarrgaen and Breinn, to help (or hinder) the Travellers. They are in command of the starport, so any complaints that rise through the chain of command will eventually reach one of them. Unarrgaen and Breinn may seem to non- Vargr or Hlanssai Travellers as if they are playing a constant verbal chess match. When speaking with each other, they will communicate in Gvegh but change to Galanglic when engaging others.

> [!info] Embla's Diary
> I tell Bu to make as little movement as possible to avoid the Hlanssai guards taking note of anything she may not want them to. She seems confused but happy and decides to sit on my shoulder as I walk us through security. Bu, naturally, is selected for a random search and I end up sitting and watching the process from the other side of the security gates. The starport guards here seem much less intimidating now that I have met Imperial security guards, although they are more prone to unpredictable bursts of violence.

Originally from Lair, Unarrgaen moved to Vrirhlanz with the rest of his pack, believing that life here would be better suited to their nature. He was offered the role here due to his charismatic nature and officials within the government realised his potential in starport operations. On paper, he is the Commander of Operations but he tends to enjoy doing smaller tasks more, such as passenger intake. His right hand, a particularly tall Hlanssai by the name of Breinn, deals with administrative duties, going to Unarrgaen when a signature is required but otherwise leaving him alone. This works for the both of them, as Unarrgaen is on the frontlines of the starport and Breinn is able to shape the starport as he sees fit.

Breinfeim’chaa Ndeifunla’aii Mdeonpak’k, public name Breinn, took to managing the starport with great tenacity. However, it has only been about six months since he took this role and it is still unclear as to whether he will continue his work when he inevitably gets bored. A N’tarronth, Breinn has begun to implement what some see as controversial measures within the starport, most being attempts aimed at reducing Vargr infighting. They have met mixed success and are backed by Unarrgaen, who usually manages to assuage dissent. Breinn grew up in one of the outlying tribes, numbering about 40 Hlanssai, and moved through many others before semi-settling in the downport region. Breinn, for the most part, can rarely be found at his home, preferring instead to meet new people and discover ‘the secrets of the universe’.

> Ah... I missed being here. There is enough going on around me that I cannot just zone out. I cannot wait to see my family, too. It has been a long time; after living here for over 40 years, it is strange to not see them for so long. I wonder if Isgnis are still able to be hired? I am not sure either of us can fly one but hopefully we will find someone who can...

# VRIRHLANZ

![[BaEVV-Vrirhlanz.jpg]]

## GENERAL INFORMATION

Vrirhlanz is an agricultural garden world and exports foodstuffs to its neighbors, [[Ngangazae]] and [[Khakhang]]. These exports are not in large quantities and more similar to artisan goods than anything else. As a client state, the downport of the planet is predominantly Vargr, with the government of the Ruler of Five controlling imports, exports and world security. With two main continents, Khukhu to the east and Uzgez to the northwest, joined by a land bridge occupied by Vargr, Vrirhlanz is a world of many disparate islands and settlements.

The world has, until this point, avoided most of the development that interstellar governments traditionally foster upon client states, with the Vargr having the mission directive of acting as guardians for the Hlanssai. Most development is centered around the starport itself, with new structures built semi-regularly to sustain the burgeoning needs of the population. The starport replicates TL10, with a steady stream of imports brought onto the planet. Outside the starport, the world remains at TL7, with limited imports given by the Vargr but otherwise little to no intervention.

Vrir Down is located at the center of a land bridge that separates the two continents of the world, giving the Hlanssai a sense of security. Before the Vargr travelled to Vrirhlanz, this bridge was frequently used by dangerous species to invade the proto-Hlanssai’s home and became the impetus for the development of their hypersensitivity. When the Vargr arrived at Vrirhlanz, they encountered a wild, hyperaware species that trusted their own kind only marginally more than the Vargr themselves. The Vargr protected the newly discovered sophonts, picking off creatures that threatened the Hlanssai before eventually returning to the land bridge to build Vrir Down.

### GOVERNANCE

The downport is the only place on Vrirhlanz with a truly uniform government, formed by the Vargr after their occupation and construction of Vrir Down. On paper, it is a participating democracy but the Hlanssai who work in the starport often do not live there and have no real way to participate, instead commuting from their mostly anarchic villages. The Vargr who run the starport use this as a way to increase their standing amongst themselves, claiming to be in high-ranking positions that have little to no meaning beyond the immediate area.

The Hlanssai, for the most part, do not have unified governments of their own. The largest would be a town called Mdera, which follows the Vargr idea of a participating democracy and is one of the most industrialised towns on the planet. Other than Mdera and Vrir Down, however, there are a number of different governments that can be encountered throughout the Travellers’ journey. As Hlanssai do not tend to form long-term attachments, this extends into the formation of governments, with Hlanssai co-existing for a time before they eventually fall apart due to infighting or different ideas. Occasionally, one may form for a longer period of time but this is usually only in the case of a pressing need that affects the majority.

In the centuries since the arrival of the Vargr, the Hlanssai have pushed even further against the formation of governments, instead returning to tribal pacts and smaller-scale democracies. With the Vargr as their permanently installed protectors, the Hlanssai are once again free to self-govern as they did in antiquity. Thanks to the technological imports of the Vargr, a few technocracies and corporate administrations have begun to spring up around the planet. However, most Hlanssai buildings still resemble those created during their species’ bronze age, adapted to include the technology they have developed.

Due to their natural lack of long-term trust, Hlanssai governments are rarely enduring, with few lasting for more than a couple of decades. This constant shifting can make it almost impossible for visitors to understand the Hlanssai when they visit the planet, as a government they may have interacted with on their last visit may no longer exist. It can be equally confusing for the Hlanssai themselves, as a primarily
‘wandering species’. One Hlanssai may live under a number of different governments throughout the course of their life, bringing ideas and complaints about former ruling bodies to their new homes.

In this way, governments are primarily influenced by the people under them, their period of living under said government notwithstanding. In this way, Hlanssai governments are unorganised and chaotic, having a large mixture of contrasting ideas brought by individual Hlanssai. This is another factor in the Vargr’s refusal to involve themselves more than eradicating species too dangerous to the Hlanssai, viewing them and their governance as more unstable than their own. This is an ongoing joke amongst the humans of Vrirhlanz, as a species more chaotic than the Vargr must be messy indeed.

### MILITARY

As there is no unified world government, there is no world military, although one may form should a particularly charismatic Hlanssai recognize an overwhelming need. The last time this occurred with a majority of Vrirhlanz’s Hlanssai, was when the Vargr arrived. However, a battle never occurred, as neither side had a need to fight each other. The Vargr recognized the potential usefulness of the Hlanssai, with the latter noting the former’s benefits also. In the centuries since, they have established a lasting, if sometimes chaotic, peace. In modern times, the Hlanssai have largely ignored any form of military structure, instead leaving the defence of their world to the Vargr.

> [!note] PRIVATE VERSUS PUBLIC
> Hlanssai follow the tradition of having private and public names, with Embla’s private name being Embla Miruenfllia’ii Drfappnak’chhh, which is cut to Embla Miruen in public. Most Hlanssai will not disclose their private name to any but their closest friends and family or on official forms, partly as an aid to pronunciation and partly from tradition. Often Hlanssai will only introduce themselves using their first name, although on occasion their private ‘secondary’ name will also be given.

### BUSINESS

Businesses on Vrirhlanz are less rigid than in the Third Imperium and generally do not last as long. They also have a less commercial structure, with no middle management positions to be seen. On some occasions, a company may start out with such positions but they then fall to the wayside as workers realise that these positions do not provide any value of their own. Occasionally, a business may form and continue a number of decades, provided the Hlanssai who started the company is charismatic and capable. However, these do not tend to last long once the Hlanssai dies.

Smaller businesses that operate locally are common, generally passed down throughout a familial line, provided the leader is of N’tarronth beliefs. N’tarronchaii’a Hlanssai do occasionally run businesses but they are more tailored to artisan goods exported to other worlds. N’tarronth Hlanssai tend to run more manufacturing-orientated businesses and are historically responsible for the technological developments of the world. Working together with Vargr scientists, they open and maintain research facilities, manufacturing plants and other industrial endeavors.

Manufacturing, research and engineering businesses such as these are the most enduring. Should one fail, another will often move into the same facility and modify its operations. This is one factor that has limited Hlanssai development, with teams of researchers taking over and continuing the work of others. Taking over research and businesses in this way causes delays, with the newer Hlanssai having to research and understand the older businesses’ method of operations before suitably modifying them. Because of this, companies may share a name over the decades whilst having completely different methods and structure.

### INFRASTRUCTURE

Vrirhlanz’s infrastructure is long-neglected, although roads lead to all but the most remote settlements. Some attempts at public transport have been made, although these tend to fail due to the Hlanssai inability for disparate groups to work together. Often requiring longer-term cooperation, there are a number of failed railway lines, tram lines and buses dotted within the larger towns. Sometimes, these may have public transport within the town itself but do not expand beyond their borders.

At TL7, most larger settlements have enough in the way of technology to organise communications, navigation systems and more. Devices can now connect globally, meaning the once-separated settlements are able to communicate with each other, facilitating global commerce more easily than ever before. Still, in order to deliver goods across the world, the Hlanssai use trucks, whether wheeled versions of their own design or grav options obtained via trade with the Vargr.

## THE JOURNEY

A journey across Vrirhlanz will not take too long, provided Travellers use a grav car and do not journey on the roads, which are badly maintained at best and patches of tarmac amidst long stretches of gravel, stones, holes and dirt at worst. To someone unfamiliar with Vrirhlanz, it would seem like a bombing exercise had been undertaken but for the Hlanssai it is just a part of having fleeting governments unable to implement long-term infrastructure. Isgni fliers are readily available at Vrir Down, with personnel in the starport building maintaining a decently sized fleet to facilitate travel across the world.

Despite this, Vrirhlanz is undeniably beautiful. For the most part, native species have managed to maintain natural equilibrium, ensuring the world is not overrun by technological development. Natural spaces are not protected by legislation as on many other worlds but by mutual understanding. Hlanssai are not vegan or vegetarian but ensure that the meat they do eat is sustainable, ensuring no species comes under risk of extinction. To the Vargr, this sometimes seems odd, and instances of a rogue Vargr hunting animals beyond what is strictly necessary have occurred, only for them to encounter a large group of Hlanssai ready to exact revenge. This is about the extent of the hostile interactions planetside and is one of the reasons the Vargr do not often leave Vrir Down.

### TRAVELLING ON VRIRHLANZ

As Travellers make their way throughout Vrirhlanz, it is likely they will encounter a number of different groups, people needing their help and more. It is, for all intents and purposes, more of a frontier world than well-developed industrial center, meaning there are considerable distances between settlements and some that have not yet been discovered by anyone other than Hlanssai. For encounters, plot hooks and interesting people, the Travellers may meet on their journey, consult the [[#Interactions table]]. These may be used to help the Travellers visualise the world better, fleshing out their journey and adding small things for them to do along the way.

|  1  | A broken down wheeled car is stopped at the side of the road and a young Hlanssai can be seen holding a booklet and shouting instructions at someone whose feet the Travellers can see poking out from underneath the car. Should the Travellers stop and help, the Hlanssai will offer directions to their home in the forested area near Vrir Down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|  2  | The Travellers pass by a settlement larger than any they have seen so far, the horizon broken by chimneys that rise high into the sky and plumes of smoke rising above them. Hlanssai can be seen moving around the exterior of a building in an unorganised mass, a group of them squaring up against another group. As the Travellers get closer, a few Hlanssai wave them down and begin earnestly explaining the situation. The first group does not think they should be working this many hours, whilst the latter believe they should be working more; both turn to the Travellers for mediation. |
|  3  | As the Travellers stop to take a short break in a seemingly empty part of Vrirhlanz, a group of Hlanssai surround their vehicle, each holding makeshift weapons. One speaks to the group, asking why they are so close to their home and whether the Travellers’ intentions are bad or good. The Travellers will need to explain who they are and diffuse the situation or risk the Hlanssai contacting the Vargr at the starport and reporting them as threatening.                                                                                                                                     |
|  4  | Between 10–15 Hlanssai surround the area near the Traveller’s vehicle, watching them with wide eyes. They begin to speak in broken Galanglic, gesturing towards the starport. They are carrying a number of large bags overflowing with food and explain, badly, that they are trying to get their goods to the starport before their scheduled ship departs for Ngangazae.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|  5  | The sensor array starts beeping and flashing, indicating oncoming danger. As the Travellers turn to look out the window, they see a small group of two or three Drans’ia, large, scaled predators, chasing a family of Hlanssai through a thicket of trees and long grasses. The Hlanssai are crying out for help and none appear to be armed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|  6  | The grav plates on the vehicle begin to shake slightly, emitting a smell that reminds the Travellers faintly of burning rubber. Soon, the flyer begins to drift easterly, despite there being no change in steering on the pilot’s part. The driver is able to maneuver it to land at a nearby settlement, where the Travellers risk being stranded.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Isgni Flyer

Consisting of a patchwork frame and basic systems, the Isgni is versatile and small enough to maneuver through most towns on the world but it has no means of protecting itself. Escaping danger relies on the passengers and crew using the ejection seats to get as far away from the vehicle as possible. With internal systems originally designed by Vargr and modified by Hlanssai, the mechanics are less robust. This causes some recurring issues, such as grav plates taking longer than usual to turn on, the steering leaning 14o to the left for the first 10 minutes of flight and the rear left window sometimes sticking at three-quarters closed.

When travelling at high speeds, the vehicle looks remarkably sleek but as soon as it comes closer or slows down, the piecemeal nature of its parts and impracticalities of its construction become apparent. Engines, grav plates and even windows and panels come from different sources, bearing the marks of a multitude of manufacturers. The design took months to finalise, with Vargr engineers strongarming the Hlanssai into putting communications, navigation and sensor systems into the vehicle to help the drivers navigate the sometimes dense landscape. The humans of Vrirhlanz have questioned the decision to make the vehicle in this way, with Hlanssai engineering combined with Vargr design, to no avail.

## DRANS’IA

Although the Vargr have managed to cull a vast majority of the species that hunted the Hlanssai in antiquity, there are those who have evaded them. The Drans’ia are underwater-dwelling lizards that return to land to hunt and build nests. They are most prevalent in the colder, dry months, where they can be spotted marching across the wetlands nearer to the northern side of Khukhu. For the most part, they stay underwater but venture onto land in aggressive packs in search of food. Their leather hides make them difficult to kill, as does their rampaging hunting style. Additionally, they often carry diseases contracted by victims who manage to survive an encounter.

# EKHUN

The further one travels from Vrir Down, the more likely they are to encounter Hlanssai tribes and settlements. On the southern coast of Khukhu lies Ekhun, a small farming and fishing village inhabited by the Miruenfllia’ii Drfappnak’chhh extended family. Although the world itself is classed as TL7, this only extends to the starport. Ekhun does not produce advanced goods and most of what they have is at TL4–5. Most older residents refuse to learn or use any technology more developed than this, meaning the younger members of the family are the ones who must adapt to the changing technology on the world.

The marshlands these Hlanssai live in are some of the most untouched on the planet, with most of those living here unaffected by or uncaring about the technology being developed across the rest of the world. That said, the younger Hlanssai here make the occasional trek into the larger towns, travelling in slightly outdated vehicles. These Hlanssai depend on imported goods from the rest of the world to remain technologically capable. Most dream of one day leaving this tribe and gaining employment elsewhere, and the elders of the tribe struggle to instil traditional values in the young. Homes here have not been updated in some time, although they all now have standard electrical, heating and water connections.

However, there are no weapons above TL4, with most of the family eschewing such dangerous items in favor of tools and items more suited to farming or fishing. As one of the relatively few mostly untouched settlements, Ekhun is a rarity for offworlders and the people here are accepting of different species. Their eldest daughter, Embla, has spent years travelling across Charted Space and brought a number of different friends back home with her. The family are warm and welcoming, offering visitors food, drinks and somewhere warm and comfortable to sleep.

Buildings are located along the coastline, with farming members of the family located further inland. All in all, there are about 10 buildings, mostly houses and one large barn. It is here the family keep their more advanced technology; cars and small steam generators that produce all the electricity they need. There are no streetlights; instead, most use electricity for a few hours at night in order to light their homes and rely on their heightened senses to travel outside. Despite this, they will leave out small seaweed candles for visitors, to assist them as they move about.

Considering their isolated location and lack of ability to communicate with the wider world, the Hlanssai may be slightly standoffish at first, although when introductions are made and once visitors are proven to be non-threatening, they open up significantly. The family have lived here for nearly a century and their ancestors moved from further inland in order to be closer to the sea and have greater access to food. However, in the years since they have established themselves as farmers and fishers, and sometimes give goods to Embla to trade for better items – hence the car. The foods they gather are mostly root vegetables and a number of battered-looking cans of herbs and spices can be seen on the shelves of some houses, traded with Vargr at the starport in return for artisan goods.

The Miruenfllia’ii Drfappnak’chhh are almost all musicians in some way and thoroughly enjoy spending their free time composing, writing and performing music. This is not a grand affair; rather, they will gather in a home and play together. The music is generally older in style, with the instruments used making sounds more natural than orchestral, and the voices of the family chiming in to accentuate the tune. Most traditional Hlanssai music may seem melancholic to offworlders but songs generally follow the theme of a people focused on safety and kinship with the world.

### FINE-TOOTHED COMB

This comb is generally only used by older Hlanssai, with the younger generations either eschewing it completely or finding easier to use versions. Its design is not user-friendly but it is intended to be decorative and was once used as a status symbol on Vrirhlanz. Those owning more ornate combs or one made from a rarer material were regarded as higher status. These are longer than the average human comb, intended to be used across the Hlanssai’s entire body. The one owned by Lirream Miruenfllia’ii Drfappnak’chhh family is the most ornate in the entire town, having been taken from the town she was raised in.
Item TL Kg Cost Fine-Toothed Comb 2 0.2 Cr1,
![[BaEVV-051.jpg]]

### CARVED FLUTE

Popular amongst the Hlanssai for its ability to sound like a wild bird call, this flute is fashioned in the same manner as in antiquity. They are complicated to learn, as there are more holes than on a human flute, and they are longer to accommodate the Hlanssai’s longer arms. In some of the more industrial towns, these are made in factories from plastic but in the wilds of Vrirhlanz, they are still hand-carved, making them vastly more expensive.

## FREOLL MIRUENFLLIA’II DRFAPPNAK’CHHH

![[BaEVV-049.jpg]]
Hlanssai Male —

The father of the clan, Freoll is serious for a Hlanssai, being the epitome of N’tarronth. It was his idea to transform their garden into a farm and he now supplies the entire family with all the foodstuffs they require. Working out crop rotations, planting seasons and planning out harvesting occupies a good portion of his downtime, with the daylight hours spent in the small fields surrounding his home, meaning he does not spend as much time chatting with the rest of his family, unlike his partner Lirream. Freoll enjoys a simple life, wanting nothing more than to provide for his family and keep them safe from the few dangers of Vrirhlanz. His education was more practical than his partner’s and most of what he knows comes from teachings passed down the generations, which can become a sticking point when the pair argue. Despite his rather backwards attitude and irritation whenever he must leave the village, Freoll is unbelievably proud of his daughter, Embla, telling visitors about how she is making her own path through the stars.

![[BaEVV-118.jpg]]
Hlanssai Female —
Lirream is more idealistic than Freoll, preferring to spend her time understanding the secrets of the universe. They met when Freoll made the journey to her home town in search of better farming tools and over the time it was being built, they decided to continue life together. Lirream manages all the vehicles the farm uses, although they are now severely outdated compared to what the more advanced towns on Vrirhlanz use. She is no natural scientist, instead focusing on philosophical ideas that science cannot yet make sense of. Most of the work of the farm falls to her husband, with Lirream instead focusing on music, philosophy, painting and mechanics. The house is covered in her art, with each of the walls displaying something she has ‘discovered’ about the universe. Some portray the stories told to her by Embla, with garish colours in blue and yellow barely forming the shapes of Hlanssai and Droyne. Lirream is responsible for teaching their son, Presofi, how to maintain and manage vehicles, using the education of her youth to help him learn.

## PRESOFI MIRUENFLLIA’II DRFAPPNAK’CHHH

![[BaEVV-119.jpg]]
Hlanssai Male 17

Presofi is the son of Lirream and Freoll, and younger sibling to Embla, whose job mainly consists of scaring away predators that stray too close to the settlement. Other than this, he tends to focus on upgrading the family home and enjoys tinkering with vehicles alongside his mother. It was he who worked out how to fix the radio in the car, which had been broken since its purchase, and has taken up the responsibility of keeping the electronics in good order. Presofi also maintains the most communication with his older sister, as he and his friends from the town make the journey to Vrir Down at least once a year to collect mail and supplies. Similarly, he gets the most advance warning about Embla’s visits, leaving the car radio running to ensure it will always pick up a signal when she reaches out to them.

> [!info]+ Embla's Diary
> It feels good to be back home, although I do wish mother and father embraced technology more. Going so long without speaking to them each time takes its toll, even with the mail network the Ruler of Five have managed to implement. Home feels different now, smaller and more fragile, and I worry about how the people who live here are faring. Lacking the advanced technology I have become used to, I cannot comprehend how I lived for 44 years before I knew what it was like to be able to buy whatever I wanted, whenever I wanted. It feels strange to leave them without any of the things I now take for granted but I know that only Prefosi would appreciate it. I managed to sneak a comms device to him so he does not have to rely on the radio, so hopefully contacting him when I arrive will be easier when I return.
>
> I always hate leaving. The lights are so small to me now as the ship takes off. Once I thought they were brighter than all of the stars in the sky, but now... they seem so fragile. I never realised how little technology we possessed until I travelled so far away. Bu has been telling me all about how societies form and change over time, and what happens when stuff develops, but it just seems like Vrirhlanz will always be the same. I missed the creature comforts I have become so accustomed to and looking back now, I have no idea how I lived for over 40 years without conveniences such as readily available devices from shops and booths.

> [!info]+ Bu's Diary
> It has been an odd experience. I have never visited such a fragmented place before but Embla seemed to understand what was happening. The entire experience was slightly uncomfortable, as no-one was working together, and they all just sort of did whatever they wanted. It is a very pretty world but the people seem to be as mercurial as Embla. Her family was lovely, although her mother kept offering me gifts of my own things and I can only assume how she got hold of them.
>
> For such a fragmented world, it is an incredible feat that they have managed to protect their environment so well, to the extent that they rotate their fishing spots to ensure none of the species are wiped out. It’s surprising that more advanced species have not adopted such a way of life, important as one’s homeworld should be to them. I think this would be a nice place to live, were you accepting of the fact that it would likely be seen as imperfect by any other Major Race. The chaos becomes somewhat comforting, after a while.
