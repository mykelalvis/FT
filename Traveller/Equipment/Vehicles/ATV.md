### THE ALL-TERRAIN VEHICLE

Numerous civilian all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) exist but the iconic eight- wheel design remains the market leader. Offering a combination of mobility, carrying capacity and affordability, these workhorses can be encountered on many worlds and are sometimes pressed into service as paramilitary vehicles.

The standard model is produced, with local variations, by a great many manufacturers. It is pressurised and capable of operating in a variety of environments, although 'all-terrain' is something of a misnomer. Extremely broken terrain, vertical cliffs and wide crevasses would defeat a standard ATV – or any other ground vehicle for that matter.

The ATV runs on eight independently steerable wheels, each of which is separately powered by an electric motor. This gives extremely fine control when needed and allows an ATV to extricate itself from soft or uneven terrain that would strand a lesser vehicle. An ATV can circle in a little less than its own length, although its ends will overhang this circle slightly. It can completely reverse direction in its own length if the driver is skilled and willing to take the time to make multiple turns.

Maximum road speed varies depending on the model and its loading, but is typically around 250 kilometers per hour. This is a very high speed for a heavy vehicle, and eats power at a rapid rate. It is safe however; crosswinds and minor bumps in the road do not trouble an ATV and the computerised driving system keeps the ATV stable.

On flat off-road terrain, a maximum speed of 150kph is attainable but may not be advisable unless the ground is known to be very flat. It is more common for an ATV to travel at 60-80kph at most on flat terrain and much more slowly if there are obstacles to be driven around or over.

The eight large tyres are filled with a foam-like gel that gives them a very low density. Tyres also act as an extra layer of shock-absorption and are self-sealing if punctured. Most ATVs carry a reservoir of gel, which can be pumped into depleted tyres, enabling a damaged ATV to more or less continue to drive on two to four damaged tyres providing their outer skins remain at least partially intact.

The low-density wheels also contribute to buoyancy in water and on some versions propulsion is by means of wheel rotation. Other variants mount a waterjet or sometimes a propeller drive. All are fully amphibious without preparation and will right themselves if upturned. Operations on open water are possible but an ATV is not a seagoing vessel. It can cross a large and reasonably calm lake, or make a short open-sea transit, but will be tossed about by wave activity and may roll in a beam sea. Being repeatedly inverted will not structurally harm a sealed ATV, and will not sink it, but loose objects inside will be flung about and personnel will suffer terribly.

Power is normally supplied by an advanced fuel-cell system good for 900 kilometers at steady cruising speed and nominally 600 kilometers if pushed hard. The plant has power take-offs in the form of both electrical sockets and rotating shafts for power tools and camp equipment. It can be replenished from any standard power source, such as a starship's reactor or dedicated heavy-vehicle charging point.

The standard ATV has a powerful set of lights plus low-light, thermal and radar driving assistance, and a longer-range terrain-mapping radar set that can be used for route-planning, map-making or survey purposes. All sensors feed into a computerised driving and mapping system, which greatly improves average off-road speed by indicating the easiest or fastest route ahead and automatically controls traction and torque supplied to the wheels when struggling through difficult terrain. With the full driver- assist package running, an ATV is extremely easy to drive, although rather ungainly and slow. More experienced users tailor the assistance package to their own capabilities to get the best performance out of the vehicle.

The driving compartment has two seats for a driver and co-driver, along with a side access hatch. There is also a roof hatch with a rather basic sling-seat to allow a crewmember to obtain a good vantage point or just enjoy the view. The driving compartment is separated from the main section of the hull by a bulkhead and can function as a secondary airlock - albeit a very inconvenient one – if necessary.

The main compartment is divided into two sections, usually referred to as
'living' and 'working'. On the standard ATV these areas are divided by a simple retractable screen and are very basic in terms of equipment. The living area contains seating for six and a folding table, whilst the working area is normally set-up to hold a variety of equipment depending upon the current mission.

Although the vehicle is pressurised, it is not well optimized for operations on airless or hostile worlds. The rear door is turned into an airlock by deploying a flexible 'baglock' inside the working compartment. This takes up some space and can require moving equipment if it has not been used for a while. Similarly, the standard ATV is not really suitable for long-term operations. There is a tiny toilet cubicle, not really worthy of the title 'fresher' and a basin that supplies water for washing and cooking.

There is no galley facility aboard a standard ATV but a boiling vessel provides hot water for drinking, washing and reconstituting dried ration packs. Living out of an ATV of this sort is often described as 'one small step up from sleeping rough', which is a little unkind. However, those forced to do so for any length of time generally agree that it is a most

![[JTAS-01-ATV-Sideview.jpg]]

The standard ATV has a hardpoint for a weapon, or large system, on the roof and can be fitted with a small turret when needed. Most are not armed but, occasionally, ATVs are pressed into service as very lightly armored combat vehicles. There is a fair amount of internal stowage but large items of equipment are normally carried in bins or lockers on the outer surfaces of the vehicle. The power plant is located under the main hull and can be accessed by way of an internal hatch if necessary.

A standard eight-wheel ATV costs Cr155000. However, many users choose to purchase various accessories. ATVs are sometimes encountered as workhorse vehicles on new colonies or small installations, swapping between roles as necessary.

##### Outer Gantry

An ATV can be fitted with a railed gantry and panels that create a wider flat area. This allows personnel to ride outside the vehicle when conditions allow and conduct experiments or work from the safety of an elevated position. A gantry costs Cr10000 to fit or Cr20000 for a folding version that does not make the vehicle any wider when closed down.

##### Construction Pack

A construction pack consists of a small 'dozer blade at the front of the vehicle and a light backhoe at the rear, along with hand-held heavy tools such as drills and saws capable of cutting or smashing rock. The pack essentially turns an ATV into a construction and earthmoving vehicle – albeit not a very good one. It costs Cr75000 and takes around two hours to fit or remove.

##### Camp Pack

A camp pack is normally carried by vehicles operating on habitable worlds. It consists of large awnings on the sides and rear of the vehicle plus lights, heaters and proximity sensors intended to create a quick and easy outdoor camp. A more advanced version uses silvered reflective materials to protect against stellar radiation and heat, and has plastic tents rather than awnings. It can be used to create a three-cell
'shirtsleeves' working environment on an airless world, accessed through the cab doors and rear airlock, plus a semi-rigid airlock leading directly outside from the rear tent. A basic camp pack cost Cr5000; the airless world variant costs Cr40000 and includes air reprocessing equipment for the tented compartments.

##### Securing/Stabilizing Pack

Normally used on low-gravity worlds or those with very turbulent wind conditions, the stability pack consists of a set of retractable feet and outriggers, which can rest on solid ground or be driven into a looser surface to prevent the vehicle from tipping over. The pack is added as a workshop modification and cannot quickly be removed. It slows the vehicle by 25% in all terrain but permits laborious crossings of very dangerous areas by a creep-and-secure method or extended operations in places where an unsecured vehicle would be in grave danger. The pack costs Cr70000 to obtain, which includes fitting.

#### FOUR-WHEEL ATV

The 4-wheel All-Terrain Vehicle is essentially a scaled-down version of the standard model, used for scouting ahead of an expedition or utility tasks in rough terrain. It shares many components in common with its larger cousin and can be driven just as easily. Rough-terrain performance is not quite as goodas, despiter the vehicle being lighter, it also has greater ground pressure.

Layout is much the same as a standard ATV, with a two-seat cab at the front and working compartment in the rear. A smaller version of the standard fuel cell power plant is located under the working compartment. The primary difference in terms of construction is the greater armor of the four-wheel ATV. Small ATVs are sometimes used as security vehicles for frontier outposts and small colonies. In that role they are generally known as scout cars, patrol vehicles or a variety of similar terms that attempt to conceal the fact that they are essentially just an off-road vehicle, possibly with a gun on the top.

#### LARGE ATV

The standard eight-wheel ATV is designed to provide transportation over a short period of time – two to three days at most – and within a limited radius. Six to nine hundred kilometers is entirely adequate for operations around a base or landed starship but, for long-range exploration and lengthy deployments, a larger and more capable vehicle is needed. The large ATV is a scaled-up version of the standard one, with twice the internal volume. This translates to roughly 30% more length and width, and slightly increased ground pressure. Performance is equivalent to the standard ATV but the large version is much better equipped and has an effectively unlimited radius of operation thanks to its fusion power plant.

The large ATV costs almost 10 times as much as the standard version. Most of this cost is incurred by the hostile environment protection package, which seals the vehicle against vacuum, insidious and corrosive atmospheres, and the fusion power plant that replaces the fuel cells of the smaller ATV. A few users prefer a conventionally fuelled variant, in which case the vehicle is Cr200000 cheaper and gains 10 Spaces for equipment or cargo – provided it can be squeezed into the underfloor reactor compartment.

Armor is a little better than a standard ATV, although this is more for micrometeorite protection than combat. The hull and windows will withstand small arms fire for a while but can be penetrated by a sufficiently determined opponent. In an actively hostile situation, the ATV's best defence is its ability to maintain a good off-road speed as it retreats.

Layout of this bigger vehicle is very similar to that of the standard ATV. The cab is almost identical, other than a small space behind the driving seats where the reactor maintenance hatch is located. This area is invariably filled with improvised storage racks, as the reactor will run for decades without refuelling.

The living section contains a tiny fresher and even smaller mini-galley, with a configurable table and seating or four-person bunking area depending on which panels are folded out. On long journeys with a full crew of eight hot-bunking, an ATV can become claustrophobic and quite unpleasant. This can be alleviated by time spent working outside or just parking for a while to allow the crew a little downtime.

The working area is normally configured when the ATV is bought and can contain scientific equipment, prospecting gear or whatever else the operators decide to fit. This area can be arranged as a living space with additional furniture. The latter can be improvised from whatever is lying around or a kit can be bought for Cr2000.

It is common for ATVs being used primarily as transportation to have one area set-up for bunking and the other for eating, socialising and sitting around complaining about how the driver cannot seem to miss a single bump. Access to the living and working area is normally by way of the rear airlock, which can be used as a normal door. The lock on a large ATV is a 'proper' airlock rather than the flimsy plastic one found on other ATVs and has decontamination and dust-removal facilities as well as stowage for vacc suits.

#### GRAV-ASSISTED ATV

The grav-assisted ATV is not a true grav vehicle but can use lifters to make short hops of up to 50m in height and 2-300m in length. The vehicle has limited manoeuvring capability whilst airborne but is very clumsy, imposing DM-2 on Drive checks.

More commonly, the grav unit is used to reduce ground pressure and allow crossings of extremely loose or weak materials such as dust pools on a moon or an extremely swampy region on an Earth-like planet. The grav unit increases the cost of the vehicle and reduces its crew capacity by half. It retains the living area more or less unchanged from other ATVs and inserts the grav drive mechanism into the rear of the compartment, with lifters and associated machinery around the base and sides of the vehicle, replacing some equipment lockers.

#### AQUATIC ATV

![[JTAS-01-135.jpg]]
Any ATV can survive being submerged or overturned in water – although this would not be pleasant for the crew. The aquatic version is designed to be stable on the surface and capable of submerging. This is achieved by means of large retractable outriggers that rest against the flanks of the vehicle until deployed. The outriggers greatly increase stability in rough water and prevent the craft from rolling over. They are also used as ballast tanks, flooding to trim the ATV for submergence.

In addition to its own waterjet propulsion system, the ATV can use jets in the outriggers whilst submerged. Top speed is around 25kph on the surface of calm water and seven to eight kilometers per hour underwater.

Small fins assist with control but most attitude control is by way of the water jets. The ATV is clumsy when submerged but can drive along the bed of a river or body of water almost as well as on dry land and at up to 20% of land speed. A secondary underwater sensor package is installed.

An aquatic ATV can operate safely at depths of up to 50 meters and with increasing risk at up to twice that. Crush depth is usually around 250-350 meters but much depends on the age of the vehicle and how recently its seals have been replaced. Leaks begin to occur after 100 meters is passed, possibly sooner if maintenance has not been kept up to date.

The working and living areas are narrowed, creating room for the outriggers to be carried against the hull. The seating/bunking area is moved into the rear of the compartment, leaving a very narrow galley and a fresher, plus some storage space in the front of the compartment. This has the effect of reducing the capacity of the vehicle to four crew and passengers.
