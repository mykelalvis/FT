#### The Darrian Confederation

The Darrian Confederation is an ally of the [[Imperium]] and welcomes Imperial ships subject to customs checks and traffic controls. The Darrian alliance dates from [[IY0595]] and was a response to a Sword Worlder invasion of the Entropic Worlds, then a territory of the Darrian Confederation.

The Darrians control a small area of space, containing 17 worlds. This has changed over time, largely due to [[Sword World]]er invasions, but otherwise the Confederation is very stable. However, some Imperial citizens view the Darrians with a certain amount of suspicion.

The reason for this is the Darrians' possession of the Star Trigger, a doomsday weapon based on the probe that caused their own near-extinction in the _Maghiz_. A version of the Star Trigger was reportedly deployed around [[IY0400]] and is carried aboard vessels of the Special Arm, a Darrian force dedicated to protecting the Star Trigger and using it if the need arises.

The Special Arm has at least one secret base; it is not known how many ships they have, nor how many Star Triggers are operational. As far as is known, the weapon has not been tested in the field; a successful test would be noticed, so the assumption is that one has not been performed. The Darrians, however, maintain they have a working Star Trigger available if needed.

Being a small state, the Darrian Confederation maintains a modest but capable navy crewed by [[Darrians]] and [[Aslan]] personnel but a handful of TL16 vessels exist, relics left over from the pre- _Maghiz_ period that cannot be replaced or even properly maintained, so they are used sparingly.

[[Darrian]] ships conduct exchange training programs with Imperial vessels and joint operations are not unknown. For the most part, the Confederation patrols and polices its own space and the [[Imperium]] does likewise. Trade ships, on the other hand, come and go as they please. However, the need to go through the unwelcoming [[Sword Worlds]] or around through neutral space limits volume of trade somewhat.

The Darrians are not at war with the [[Sword Worlds]] but a state of mutual mistrust and dislike exists, seasoned with ongoing resentment over the Entropic Worlds and other issues, although neither side wants open war.

The Confederation is not expansionistic. There are many unclaimed worlds nearby but the Darrians have never showed much interest in acquiring new territories. Its people are more interested in scientific research and finding ways to improve their peaceful lives.

Darrian itself receives a fair numbers of tourists who go to see the high-tech wonders left behind by the Maghiz. However, the capital of the Confederation is at Mire, the first world to regain spaceflight and is today the center of both government and the economy.
