### SuSAG

Schunamann und Sohn, AG LIC (SuSAG)
SuSAG is highly active in the chemical, pharmaceutical and engineering market sectors. Most of its products are commonplace, including many trusted brands, and its engineers have assisted in the constriction of several starports and other major facilities. SuSAG is involved in research into biochemical warfare and, although its PR arm makes much of the 'defences and protection' aspect of this activity, the firm does attract bad press. SuSAG makes some of the best hostile environment equipment available but is widely thought to use this as a cover for weapons research. It maintains small research facilities in remote parts of various star systems, heavily guarded and very secretive.

Also known as SuSAG, LIC, Schunamann und Sohn was first
registered in 252 as an Imperial corporation. However, the firm had
links to a defunct Sylean firm of much greater antiquity and still uses
the AG suffix as a reminder of its pedigree.

SuSAG started out as a manufacturer of psionic–enhancing drugs,
which was entirely acceptable in the early years of the Imperium
but ceased to be something a reputable (or legal) firm would be
involved with. SuSAG began to move into other areas just in time to
avoid disaster as the Psionics Suppressions kicked the bottom out
of that particular market.

SuSAG is today the premier Imperial chemical and pharmaceutical
corporation. Its biochemical warfare division has a particularly bad
reputation for safety, which is not entirely undeserved. As a result

of a lot of bad press as well as concerns about security and safety,
SuSAG normally sites its production and research plants in remote
and uninhabited areas or on planetoids.

SuSAG has extensive interests outside the Imperium, and one of
the largest Megacorporate security forces. The firm has shown
that it is entirely willing to interfere in local affairs in order to
protect its interests. It has also been accused of illegal research
and continued involvement in psionic drugs production despite
an Imperial injunction. To somewhat offset this bad reputation,
SuSAG subsidizes a number of medical charities and disaster–relief
agencies as well as sponsoring large numbers of medical students.
