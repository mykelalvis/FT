# Walstons

Most land-dwelling animals on [[Walston]] are harmless egg-laying burrowers of one sort or another. Many species can hibernate for long periods to survive a drought and most possess a coat of coarse hair to insulate them. There is nothing on land that can directly harm a human, although some burrowers can be a nuisance. Favourite tricks include climbing into awkward spaces on vehicles to enjoy the warmth from a power plant or burrowing under fences into a cultivated area, then engaging in a devastating feast.

One species of burrowers, known simply as Walstons, are kept as pets by many families on Walston. Sociable and loyal beasts the size of rabbits, Walstons are vegetarian and easy to care for, and seem to like living in the homes of humans and Vargr. They have absolutely no value as guards or working animals, being slow-witted and lazy when well fed. They do, however, emit a pleasing humming sound when petted and will snuggle up to anyone in emotional distress, apparently to offer comfort.
