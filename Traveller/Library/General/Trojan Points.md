# Trojan Points

in a gravitational system composed of a small body orbiting a much larger one (such as a planet and star or moon and planet) there are two stable points lying in the small body's orbit 60Â° ahead and behind it; these are called Trojan points. The Trojan points of a gas giant near an asteroid belt commonly collect a cluster of asteroids. The name comes from the first such cluster discovered by [[Terra|Terran]]s at Jupiter in the Sol system; the asteroids were named after mythical heroes of the Trojan War.
