## INTELLIGENCE SERVICES

There are intelligence agencies at all levels of Imperial government. Much as worlds are allowed to govern themselves, they are also allowed to gather their own intelligence provided they do not act against the interests of the Imperium itself. Likewise, members of the Imperial bureaucracy at the planetary, subsector, sector and sometimes even the domain level operate networks of agents who perform surveillance activities, engage in espionage, analyse collected data and use the obtained information to inform their decisions.

Intelligence agencies assume many forms from immense bureaucratic organizations down to small cabals of informers. The Imperial Army, [[Scout Service]] and Navy each have intelligence-gathering arms. Army Intelligence is primarily concerned with gathering strategic information about the worlds of the Imperium and those of its potential enemies. Internally, Army Intelligence keeps track of political movements, insurrections, terrorist groups and others whom they may be called upon to oppose. They also keep up-to-date cartographic information on all Imperial worlds and those of foreign polities near Imperial borders.

### IMPERIAL NAVAL INTELLIGENCE

Perhaps the best-known spy agency is Imperial Naval Intelligence (INI). The INI has officers posted to most Imperial Navy bases. The vast majority of INI officers are administrators who use the navy’s considerable reach to surveil and collect data on everything from current events on Imperial worlds, interplanetary incidents, interstellar anomalies, potential threats to the Imperium, conflicts between rival corporate entities and merchant activity at all levels, from megacoporate freighters down to the interface lines. It is considerably more difficult to track the activities of tramp traders but the INI has been known to investigate suspected smugglers, pirates and other suspected malcontents among the free trader community from time-to-time.

INI administrators are given broad discretionary powers, including the ability to hire and train agents. Mid-level INI officers, often called ‘minders’, are permitted to build intelligence networks with certain guidelines and limitations. These networks are composed of smaller units called cells, which typically include 4–12 individual agents. Cells are carefully cultivated and managed by their minders and a given cell might not even be aware of another’s existence within the same organization or that of another minder. Minders are careful to prevent their cells from working at cross purposes or inadvertently interfering with each other’s missions. The technology available to INI administrators makes managing a complex array of cells relatively trivial but care must be taken nonetheless.

### IISS INTELLIGENCE

The [[Scout Service]] also maintains an intelligence service, which is subordinate to its Security division. Unlike the navy, where INI officers manage a network of intelligence agents, in the scouts agents are part of the standard IISS framework. The scouts have a much looser hierarchy than the navy and their intelligence services reflect that. Agents do not receive specialized training, instead using the skills they have acquired in their chosen branch to carry out espionage and intelligence-gathering duties.

While there is no official structure such as that in the INI, members of IISS Intelligence often build networks of cells that resemble those of the navy. Their primary recruits are retired scouts, particularly those assigned scout ships by the Detached Duty division. Obligated by the [[Scout Service]] to serve when called upon to do so, detached duty scouts and their ships make excellent spies. Scouts who run the networks are not called minders as they are in the INI but do have a number of less-official nicknames, some of which are a little derisive. Den mother, trail boss and cat herder are some of the more popular ones.

Agents in the [[Scout Service]] are often seen as ‘the foreign office’ whereas INI agents operate within the Imperium most of the time. Many scouts, especially those in the Exploration branch, have travelled beyond Imperial borders, giving them a greater understanding of alien cultures and foreign polities. As such, they often make better operatives for missions outside of the Imperium; intelligence agents from the scouts are often recruited by INI minders when they require an agent with foreign expertise.

> [!INFO]- ON HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY’S SECRET SERVICE
> Most INI officers stay in administrative roles and operatives are rarely drawn from long-term career ranks of the navy itself. However, naval officers can and do become field agents on occasion. These agents have their naval rank frozen for the duration of their service as intelligence operatives. Many are outfitted with augments that prevent them from being able to give up state secrets or key data regarding the movement or operation of Imperial Navy vessels.

> Travellers may be created who have served in both INI administration or field operative roles. Travellers in INI administration must be officers in the line/crew assignment of the Navy career. However, skills received from the Line/Crew table are replaced with the following:
>
> |  1D | LINE/CREW   |
> | :-: | ----------- |
> |  1  | Electronics |
> |  2  | Admin       |
> |  3  | Gun Combat  |
> |  4  | Streetwise  |
> |  5  | Persuade    |
> |  6  | Deception   |
>
> To become an INI field agent, the Traveller must first serve at least one term in the Navy career, then successfully qualify for the Agent career, selecting the intelligence assignment. Failure to qualify indicates that the Traveller’s request to receive a field agent posting has been denied. Terms served as a field agent are carried out as a separate career. However, if the Traveller opts to transfer back into the Navy administration role, no roll is required; the Traveller simply resumes the following term in line/crew, as before, returning to the rank held previously. The Traveller may also opt to transfer to another branch in the Navy career as normal. When mustering out, the Traveller may make all rolls on the Navy Benefits tables or may split the rolls between the two careers based on terms served in each.

> [!info]- The Agent
> **Patron** : INI Minder, Lt. Nimath Tence, who might be a Contact or Ally of one of the Travellers but at the very least he has selected them on good authority that they are a trustworthy group loyal to the Imperium.
> **Location** : Rorpa Din/Chant.
> **Pre-requisites**: This patron encounter is based on Marc Miller’s Traveller novel, Agent of the Imperium. Ideally, the Traveller who installs the Angin wafer will have read the book in order to play the role of Jonathan Bland, the Decider.
> **Requirement**: One Traveller in the group must have a wafer jack and neural link.
> **Equipment** : One Angin wafer.
> **Mission** : After one of the Travellers installs the Angin wafer, he becomes Jonathan Bland for the duration of the patron encounter and subsequent adventure. Bland will go through his standard operating procedure, first asking the group, ‘Who is senior?’ and then proceeding to conduct the operation, applying Rules 1–6 of the Agent Standing Orders, as described in Agent of the Imperium. Lt. Tence informs him that a group of insurgents has allegedly infiltrated the proxy government of Rorpa Din, which is administered offworld by the government of Traa. While the organization of the insurgents is unknown, it is believed they have obtained nuclear weapons that they intend to use to attack either against Rorpa Din itself or some of the most populous asteroids of the Traa system. Lt. Tence had a cell of agents monitoring the insurgents’ activities and they found out what was going on. Unfortunately, he has lost contact with the members of his cell and fears the worst. Because there is a perceived threat to a world of the Imperium and no viable Imperial authority present, Lt. Tence opted to use the Angin wafer to find out what he should do next.
> **Reward** : Cr100000 per Traveller and possible future agent assignments for the group.

> The Angin wafer is, by all appearances, designed for insertion into a standard wafer jack. However, once inserted, the mind of the user is taken over by a Decider agent, one of several coded personalities based on a previously living servant of the Imperium named Jonathan Bland. The Traveller is under Bland’s control as long as the wafer is in place.
