### Pernach Solutions

Pernach Solutions is one of the best-known private security companies in [[Deneb Sector|Deneb]], providing services to corporations and colonies on many worlds. It was founded by [[#Alistair Humbolt| Alistair Halker]] using members of his own security staff, funded by money given by his father upon his graduation from university.  His security experts began hiring ex-military to round out their personnel. Alistair's people were able to use their contacts to secure several high-profile contracts within [[Deneb Sector|Deneb]], including acting as bodyguards to corporate executives from [[Makhidkarun]] and for the [[Duchy of Sabine]]. Within the last decade they have also expanded to offer security forces for planets lacking established law enforcement or Imperium military facilities. The increased need for security personnel has caused Alistair to authorise the hiring of any able-bodied person who can wield a baton or a pistol, leading to relatively unsavoury individuals being offered positions of authority. Alistair is not too picky as long as they remain loyal to him first and they do not cause bad press for Pernach.

> The Humbolts used their contacts to establish Alistair's assumed name of Halker so the company could not be linked back to them
