# Introduction

The Imperial Marines are the primary shipborne fighting force of the Imperium. The marines are steeped in tradition, having served admirably since year 0. Imperial Marines are instantly recognizable by their distinctive combat armor and battle dress. Likewise, their dress uniform with its maroon tunic, white trousers and shiny black boots tends to stand out in a crowd. Marines who have taken part in a jump (orbital assault) operation wear the drop slash, a small vertical piece of cloth on the back of the collar, black on field fatigues and red on the dress uniform tunic.

Historically, marines were an amphibious fighting force transported into combat zones by a wet navy. While star marines are not carried aboard ocean-going ships – although they can be, if necessary – Imperial Marine units are carried on most naval spacecraft. The purpose of a marine fighting force is essentially to finish the job when naval force alone cannot do so. The first stage of most wars is carried out between starships but even after one side has defeated the other, the losing side does not always surrender. Sometimes an orbital assault is required on a planet, asteroid or other terrestrial target to finish the job. Marines may be involved in both stages of such a conflict, first by raiding enemy spacecraft during a starship battle and second by serving as jump troops.

Raids are challenging. Taking an enemy starship, even one that has been disabled, can be a dangerous undertaking. Marine boarding parties stay in tight communication with each other and maintain precise spacing and coordination. Raiding marines arm themselves with a cutlass, snub pistol, accelerator rifle or laser carbine and a selection of appropriate hand grenades. ACRs, gauss rifles and other long guns are to be avoided since they are difficult to use in the tight confines of a starship. Raiding a starship is a leap into the great unknown. The crew might be prepared to surrender or might be armed to the teeth and intent on repelling boarders. Marines are always ready to fight their way into a ship but must also be prepared to fight their way back out if necessary. As a famous marine once said, ‘there’s no such thing as retreat but sometimes you can shoot in all directions’.

Jump troops drop from space with re-entry capsules, ablative shields, deployment shuttles or other means in order to spearhead an assault. For more information about re-entry capsules, see page 46 of High Guard. After a successful landing, the marines usually give way to the army, who come in to secure strategic targets and occupy worlds. In some cases, marines stay to help. As the saying goes, ‘All marines are riflemen’ and they are capable infantry.

Marines are organised in regiments of 3,500 for lift infantry deployments or Marine Expeditionary Forces (MEFs) of 2,000 for jump-troop operations. MEFs are austere units that include just enough support personnel to enable the unit to operate independently after a drop. The subordinate organizational structure is the same as the army, except that squads are called sections.

Powerful noble houses often maintain their own private marine corps, called lift infantry regiments. For more information on these, see [[#LIFT INFANTRY REGIMENTS]].

# BRANCHES OF THE MARINES

The _Traveller Core Rulebook_ includes three branch assignments for Travellers in the marines: support, star marine and ground assault.

Support includes quartermasters, combat engineers, medics, cavalry and staff. These are the marines who run the raids, manage the drops and run the command post during a lift operation. They are also the corpsmen, the combat medics who patch the infantry back up and ship them out or put them back into service. Marine units are accustomed to absorbing a high casualty rate. A qualified support team is the glue that keeps a regiment or MEF running after the attrition of war takes its toll. It should be noted that support staff are equally trained and capable of picking up a rifle and donning a suit of combat armor when called upon to do so.

Star marines and ground assault are two sides of the same coin: infantry. Star marines focus on raiding and other shipborne operations and ground assault focus on lift-infantry and jump-troop operations. To some extent, marines from both branches are interchangeable. They have similar skills and are trained on the same weapons and gear for the most part. However, where star marines rely on instinct, small arms and precise training regimens, ground assault marines are more skilled in the use of heavy weapons, military tactics and coordinating operations with naval transport or marine armor units.

# ENCOUNTERS WITH THE IMPERIAL MARINES

Running into the Imperial Marines usually means that the Travellers are somewhere they should not be. If marines are encountered, they may have either just completed a mission or are in the process of completing one. Being caught in the middle of a marine deployment can be dangerous. Marines performing a jump-troop operation are a sight to see. Should a group of Travellers find themselves on a world under siege, the sight of thousands of ground assault marines dropping from space could make for an exciting environment. However, once they hit the ground, the Travellers should make certain that they do not get caught between the marines and their target.

Travellers in possession of a starship may also encounter marines when they are subjected to an inspection. Most inspections are carried out by planetary navies, some of whom maintain their own marines. If the Travellers find themselves being boarded by Imperial Marines, it typically means they have found themselves in a critical location or situation. When visiting worlds that have key Imperial assets – for example, Capital, Reference or Depot – Travellers are likely to be subjected to an Imperial Marine inspection. The Travellers might also encounter the marines after inadvertently wandering into a star system that is on high alert. For example, the navy and marines may have been called upon to quell a revolt or interdict a world. Depending on the severity of the situation, all ships that visit the system might be inspected. In such a situation, the Travellers might want to make certain that they are not carrying anything in their cargo hold that could be construed as contraband.

> [!INFO]- A CASE OF MISTAKEN IDENTITY
> **Patron**: Sergeant Laon Kantil, Imperial Marines 103<sup>rd</sup> Provisional Expeditionary Force
> **Mission**: After coming out of jump at the 100-diameter limit, the Travellers’ ship is hailed by a naval cutter, which demands they stand down and prepare for boarding. The Travellers might be rattled by the aggressiveness of the orders they are given. The cutter docks with their ship and they are subjected to a thorough inspection by a section of Imperial Marines. After (hopefully) finding nothing amiss, marine Sergeant Kantil meets with the Travellers to extend his apologies. Their ship was identified on a list of possible smugglers; apparently, a criminal operation on a nearby world has found a way to ‘spoof’ transponder codes and has been using them to impersonate law-abiding starship crews. The sergeant informs the Travellers that there is a reward for any information that leads to the arrest of the criminals.
> **Reward**: Cr100000 for information that leads to the capture of the culprits, the Travellers get to clear their names and they make a Contact of Sergeant Kantil.
