Martha is a friendly woman with a motherly demeanour. Although she is showing the signs of a hardworking person in her fifties, she was obviously a very attractive woman in her prime and her eyes still sparkle with the zest of life.

Martha is also well known for being somewhat flirtatious, especially with young handsome men. She has cheeky charm that wins over many people but she can get a little lewd at times. Her advances are usually harmless fun but occasionally she takes a special liking to some of the travellers that pass through.
