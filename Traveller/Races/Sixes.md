Cultural Information: [[Tionale]]’s extensive, heavily-jungled outback is native to a little studied, six-limbed sophont known colloquially as the "Sixes" (on account of their six limbs). Theirs is a pastoral, TL– 0 hunter-gatherer culture with no governmental institutions other than tribal warrior chieftains. Warfare and feuding are endemic among the ‘Sixes’, but their relations with the colonists had generally been peaceful until 1103 , when the first in a series of escalating attacks on outlying farmsteads took place. The reasons for these hostilities are unknown, since the 'Sixes' have never been subjected to meticulous scientific study and only the rudiments of their language (which includes dozens of regional variants) are understood. Even their numbers are impossible to judge with any precision, though given the size of their range and density in the vicinity of the colonized region, the planet-wide population must number in the millions. Due to the growing frequency and intensity of Sixes attacks, the Travellers' Aid Society has classified Tionale as an Amber Zone. The colonists have been slow to respond to the mounting threat because they have no armed forces and are reluctant to create any due to the expense and the extremely limited size of the military-age population. Proposals to create a voluntary militia have been put forward and voted down in all of the popular assemblies held since late 1103. However, as attacks and casualties continue to rise, public opinion seems to be coming around to the view that the establishment of a militia is essential and inevitable. Most of the proposals that were defeated in the Popular Assembly foresaw a force of about 400 infantrymen equipped to TL– 6 standards, no more than 200 of whom would be available at any given time. A small cadre of professional mercenaries would be hired to train the militia.
