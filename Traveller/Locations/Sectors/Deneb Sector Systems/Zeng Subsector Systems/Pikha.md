### PIKHA

Pikha is a high-tech, high-population world, making it important to the subsector's economy. This is unfortunate for other nearby worlds, as Pikha's extremely bureaucratic government imposes complex regulations on all imports, exports and technology transfers. Doing business at Pikha is necessary but also painfully slow and needlessly complex.

The Pikha system is extensively colonized, with cities on several of the terrestrial bodies and in the planetoid belt too. These are not independent communities; they are subject to the same central government as any city on the mainworld. This is not without its problems, as there have been insurrections in the past and at any given time at least one city is subject to low-level agitation and protests against some aspect of governance.

In-system traffic is constant and complex, with large and small freighters plying between mines and industrial sites and commercial flights between worlds taken for granted by most inhabitants. The vulnerability of all this shipping requires that Pikha maintain a strong in-system security presence. Its shipyards cannot build jump-capable vessels but sublight liners and freighters are a speciality, with a steady stream of orders for patrol craft as well. Pikha's system squadron is biased towards piracy suppression and law enforcement rather than defence of the mainworld; other than a large planetoid-hulled monitor the squadron is entirely made up of small patrol vessels of 400 tons or less.

THOUSAND FREIGHTER



The Thousand Freighter is an in-system vessel built around a 1000-ton cargo hold; all other functions are dedicated to moving this hold and its contents around the system. The vessel is normally operated by a small crew and typically just one or two passengers will be aboard on any given trip. More can be carried if the crew move into double-occupancy but most Thousand Freighters have one or two 'guest rooms'
and fill the rest up with the belongings of the crew, spare parts and whatever else is lying around. These ships have a reputation for being a very basic form of transport but they move cargo cheaply and efficiently, which is all their operators really care about.
