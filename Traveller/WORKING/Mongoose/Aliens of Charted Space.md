# ALIENS OF CHARTED SPACE: VOLUME 1

![[AoCS1-0011.jpg|200]]

# INTRODUCTION

Portraying an alien race or a member of one is a challenge. It is easy to pick a few significant characteristics and overplay them, creating a caricature, or turn them into a generic human with a different hat by not accentuating their differentness. The key to a plausible alien is to understand their motivations and what makes their society work. Nobody does anything without a reason, even if the reason is unknown or incomprehensible to outsiders.

The [[Zhodani]], for example, have developed a way of life that seems entirely natural to them. The idea that rather than striving for the things they want, [[Zhodani]] citizens may be conditioned to stop wanting them may seem strange to outsiders, but to the [[Zhodani]] it is a much better option than being unhappy due to a desire for things a Traveller does not need and cannot obtain. This is not dissimilar to someone who has left behind the desire for material things upon finding religious revelation and is happier for it.

It is worth considering the implications of a culture's beliefs in terms of what they think of others. The [[Zhodani]] are likely to view advertising in the [[Imperium]] as a crude and rather nasty way of modifying the thinking of citizens in order to deprive them from their money. This is not done for the benefit of the people; quite the opposite in fact. Advertising is largely intended to make people unhappy so that they try to remedy the situation by buying what the advertiser wants.

The other cultures in this book can be viewed in the same light. [[Vargr]] may seem fickle for the way they gravitate from weaker leaders to stronger ones, but this results in a stronger and more resilient society than one in which leadership can be achieved by playing the system or being good at a non-leadership role. A bureaucrat who eventually becomes head-penpusher in their organization is suddenly forced to lead others but may have no idea how. A typical [[Vargr]] would consider this situation ridiculous â€“ should the leader not be someone who has proven fit to hold the position? And should they not be cast aside when they fail in their leadership role?

The [[Aslan]] are warriors, but not warriors for the sake of fighting or killing everything in sight. They fight to gain land and status, with the strongest taking the most. This can produce a strong and stable society capable of withstanding any challenge, if internal conflict is kept within acceptable limits. Thus the Aslan have rules of precedence and a highly developed notion of honor. The need to behave in an acceptable manner regulates ambition and ensures that any conflict has purpose.

Likewise, the strict hierarchy of the [[K'Kree]] gives strength to their society. As herd creatures who cannot stand to be apart, they need a strong social order. Theirs is based upon the leadership of a noble class raised to lead and command rather than the turbulent meritocracy of the [[Vargr]] or the rigid demands of [[Aslan]] clan society, but it serves the same purpose. As a herbivore species, [[K'Kree]] are determined to destroy all carnivores because otherwise sooner or later they will become prey. It is an extreme viewpoint, but one that has a certain logic to it.

So, the societies presented within this book are internally consistent. Understanding their mindset is a learning experience, and will allow them to be portrayed in a much more interesting manner than a two-dimensional caricature of a few critical points.
